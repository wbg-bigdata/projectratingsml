APPENDIX A-DESCRIPTION OF THE SERVICES
1     SCOPE OF WORKS
1.1   Environmental Scoping
The Consultant will describe and evaluate the current environmental situation
of the country, including:
a)    an overview  of national environmental policy, legislation and
directives relevant to the ROADS3 sector programme
b)   integaration within the overall road sector strategy for Mozambique;
c)   review of specific environmental guidelines for the roads sector
developed under the ROCS programmes
d)    overview of biophysical and socio-economic aspects including areas of
high priority for conservation of natural habitats, formally protected
areas such as national parks, fragile ecosystems, demographics,
ethnicity, gender aspects, HIV/AIDS etc. The Consultant will identify
distinct biophysical/socio-economic zones within Mozambique that
would be impacted on.
e)   review  of institutional capacity within ANE, other government
institutions and the private sector to monitor and enforce
environmental guidelines and to undertake EIAs on sub-projects.
1.2   EIA's for Phase 1: Investment programme
The Consultant will identify typical environmental impacts that will result
from road works in the distinct biophysical/socio-economic zones identified
during the environmental scoping exercise and especially with regard to the
roads program of Phase 1 of the Investment programme.
The Consultant will propose environmental guidelines to be used in the
individual road sub-projects to mitigate negative impacts. Existing EIA
material used by the Ministry of the Environment (MICOA) will be used
where available and the recommendation should be based on the existing ANE
Environmental Guidelines. Special recommendations with respect to
collaboration with MICOA on screening of sub-projects and undertaking EIAs
should be provided. The guidelines will cover:
a)    environmental screening of sub-projects, with reference to the
specific characteristics of the distinct ecological, demographic,
ethnic and socio-economic environments in Mozambique. The
screening guidelines should conform with the overall
FILE  COPY                    requirements of MICOA



b)    carry out the full comprehensive EIA on specific Phase 1
Investment programme, sub-projects as defined within ANE
known and approved (Road Sector Strategy study) works.
These studies should also include the requirements for EIA
standards adopted by MICOA
c)    comprehensive formulation of required mitigation measures,
cost impacts and assessments with related recommendations
c)    proposed modifications to existing Conditions of Contract and
works   specifications  to  incorporate  environmental
requirements.  These EIA's should reflect regional and
international  experience  and  environmental  guidelines
published by the Word Bank and other donor agencies
1.3   Monitoring and Enforcement
The Consultants will make recommendations for strengthening existing
institutions and building capacity to manage the environmental requirements
for sub-projects. This will include:
a)   recommendations  for  strengthening   ANE's  in-house
environmental capacity to manage, assess, monitor and control
the environmental impacts of the ROADS3 sub-projects
including: position of the environmental unit within ANE;
organisational structure; manpower resources and training
requirements; equipment needs and availability; budget
estimate for the unit; and monitoring and implementation
procedures  (ie  checklists,  environmental  performance
indicators etc)
b)    assessment of local private sector consulting capacity for
undertaking EIAs and routine environmental monitoring of site
works
c)   recommendations for allocating specific responsibility for
monitoring contractor performance at site level within the ANE
environmental unit, consultant supervision teams and the
provincial road agencies (DEPs).
1.4   Training Needs
The Consultant will identify needs for environmental training within ANE,
government institutions and private sector contractors and consultants.
Outline proposals for training programs for each group of stakeholders will be
prepared. An estimate of the cost must be made and a financing plan
proposed.



1.5   Public Consultation
Public consultation is an integral part of the EA process. Initial public
consultation will be undertaken with local communities, national and
international NGOs, scientific experts, relevant government agencies (at
national, provincial and district level) and the private sector.  The draft
recommendations of the study will be discussed with key stakeholders at
workshops to be held in Maputo, Beira and Nampula. Feed-back from the
workshops will be incorporated in the Final Report.
1.6   Environmental Management Plan
The overall mitigation plan will recommend feasible and cost effective
measures to prevent or reduce significant negative impacts to acceptable
levels. The Consultant will estimate the impacts and costs of these measures,
and of the institutional and training requirements to implement them.
Compensation to affected parties for impacts which cannot be mitigated
should be considered. The Consultant should prepare a short and concise
management plan including proposed work programs, budget estimates,
schedules, staffing and training requirements, and other necessary support
services to implement the mitigating measures.
1.7   Reporting
The draft EA report should focus on findings of the environmental scoping
exercise and preliminary conclusions and recommendations. The
comprehensive reporting of the EIA's for Phase 1: Investment programme
should be accommodated as a priority deliverable of the EA.  The
requirements within 3.2 should thus be allocated as a major component of the
EA but must furthermore be provided within the strict time scales defined
below.
The final reporting should also include alternative recommendations for the
environmental management system for presentation to the stakeholders.

I INTRODUCTION AND ADMINISTRATION
1.1 INTRODUCTION
This document describes the socio-economic context of Mozambique for the purposes of the
environmental assessment of the ROADS3 Program. Information is provided to describe
population trends, the macro economy, and political context. More specific information is
provided in terms of overall access to services such as education and health and crop
production.
1.2 ADMINISTRATION
Mozambique is a large country with a land area of 784,090 square kilometres (kmi2) located in
south-east Africa sharing borders with Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and South
Africa. The Indian Ocean coastline of Mozambique is in excess of 2,700 kilometres. The
country is divided and administered into ten Provinces (See Map 1). Each Province is divided
into Districts of which 129 exist in Mozambique.  Each District is sub-divided for
administrative purposes into Administrative Posts and further sub-divided into Localities. The
country is also divided into three broad regions: North, Central and South. Northern Region
consists of Cabo Degado, Niassa, Nampula and Zambezia Provinces. Central Region consists
of Tete, Manica, and Sofala Provinces. Southern Region consists of Maputo, Gaza, and
Inhambane Provinces.  Regional categorisation is used more for the calculation and
presentation of broad indices such as agricultural production or to describe climatic conditions.
Each province is administered through a Governor selected by the Mozambican President. At
the provincial level there exists the extensions of the departments of government such as
Ministries of agriculture, education, and health. Policy is made at the central government level
to be implemented by the various provincial ministries. The Governor perforns the function
of co-ordinator of the various ministries. The Governor does not have the authority to select or
replace a provincial head of a ministry. This authority is vested in the respective Ministers of
government. These administrative and organisational structures are undergoing a period of
change as described in more detail in the political section below.
1.3 POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT
The second multi-party election was completed successfully in December 1999. There was a
high voter turnout of 64 percent. This was almost the same as the turnout for the first elections
in 1994. The ruling party, Frente de Libera,ao de Mo,ambique (FRELIMO), and its president
Joaquim Chissano were re-elected with 52.3 percent of the vote. The margin of majority over
the opposition, the Resistencia Nacional Mocambicana (RENAMO) leader Alfonso Dhlakama,
was reduced compared to 1994. FRELIMO, however, increased its parliamentary majority,
from 129 of 250 seats to 133 of 250 seats.
The first-ever local elections in Mozambique took place in the largest 33 cities and towns in
1998, and the new municipal assemblies began work in 1999. Although local elections were
boycotted by RENAMO and suffered from a low turnout, candidates from citizens' lists and

IMPACTO
opposition parties were elected in six cities and have formed vocal oppositions within the local
assemblies. These elections marked the first step in an extensive process of decentralisation, in
which the new municipalities are progressively taking on powers over local services, basic
health and education, and local economic development.
Mozambique was a one-party State from independence in 1975 until 1990, when a new
constitution was adopted, creating a multiparty system with a separation of powers. The
system has a strong President who appoints the Government, a Parliament that must approve
the annual budget and plan as well as all legislation, and an independent court system. A
revised draft constitution, which would have shifted powers from the President to Parliament,
has been deferred to the new legislature, since consensus could not be reached on the final
version.
The changing political process runs much more deeply than simply elected bodies. A vibrant
civil society of pressure groups, associations of business people, women, peasants, trade
unions and churches is growing and becoming more active. An independent press is now well
established, ensuring that a broad spectrum of political views and interest groups is heard. This
political growth and vibrancy is particularly remarkable considering the national context: a
country only recently emerging from a long and bitter period of conflict, low levels of literacy
and widespread poverty, and all of this in a large country with poor communications.
The new land law marks the most direct interaction between the new democracy and economic
development issues. The law was approved in 1997 and regulations to enforce it came into
effect in 1999. This involved four years of consultation and debate, with frequent redrafting,
in one of the most open and democratic processes seen in Mozambique. Active campaigning
and lobbying by civil society and intervention by Parliament led to the approval of firm
occupancy rights for peasants and other landholders and the rejection of international pressure
to allow land sales and mortgages. Other provisions saw women's rights increased, traditional
leaders given a greater role, and the creation of a form of collective tenure. In addition, the
powers of the Council of Ministers to reallocate land were restricted.
The law confirmed the overriding rights of present occupants, and required that all outstanding
applications for land for development projects be resubmitted. Fewer than 10 percent of these
were, ending fears that widespread land grabbing would displace peasants. New and renewed
applications would only be considered if local people had been consulted. Pressure groups and
peasant associations launched massive publicity campaigns in 1999 to inform people of their
rights, to good effect.
1.4 TRADITIONAL ADMINISTRATION
Traditional administrative structures still exist in Mozambique based upon the concept of a
Chief or headperson of a community or ethnic group. This traditional structure exists, to lesser
or greater extent, in most localities side-by-side with the more modern administrative apparatus
of the State and political parties. In general terms the first government of an independent
Mozambique from 1975 attempted to replace the inherited colonial and traditional systems
with a centralised system based upon the political doctrines of socialism. With political and
economic reforrn since the mid-1980's the intention of the Government has been to replace a
highly centralised system by devolving increasing amounts of decision making authority to
provincial and district levels. This process is dynamic and subject to political influences.

2 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
2.1 POPULATION
The population of Mozambique according to the 1997 national census was 15.3 million. The
actual population recorded by the 1997 census was below expectations. Before the census the
population estimates were about 17 million and this is why documents often state the
population of Mozambique as over 17 million. The population growth rate is 2.2 percent per
annum. This will result in a Mozambican population in 2004 of about 18 million inhabitants.
Approximately 35 percent of Mozambican's are under the age of 30 years of age. The age
structure is as follows. 0-14 years constituting 46% of the population (male 4,141,915 and
female 4,115,191), 15-64 years constituting 51% of the population (male 4,324,102 and
4,868,518 female, and 65 years and over 3% of the population (male 184,606 and 243,595
female). Household sizes are large at 5.5 members, and the ratio between economically active
and passive members (less than 15 years or more than 60 years) of the population is high with
a dependency ratio of 1:1. These figures are presented in Table 1.

Mozambique is a relatively sparsely populated country with an average population density of
19 persons per kM2. Some Provinces such as Niassa have population densities below 10
persons per km2. The most populous Provinces are Nampula with 2,977,233 inhabitants and
Zambezia with 2,891,809 inhabitants. The greatest population concentration is to be found in
Maputo Province in the contiguous urban areas of Maputo City and Matola City where
approximately 10 percent of Mozambique's population live. Most Mozambicans, over 80
percent, live in rural areas.

IMPACTO
The urban population has been increasing in all areas of Mozambique. At the beginning of the
1980's, 13 percent of the population were located in urban centres. By the mid-1990's, 27
percent of the population were living in urban areas. Despite a generally rapid rise in the rate
of urbanisation, no single city in Mozambique has a population greater than one million
inhabitants. Maputo City combined with the City of Matola has a population of almost 1.5
million. The first eleven cities in Mozambique ranked by population size are as described in
Table 3.

Pemba             Cabo Delgado             66,000
2.2 ETHNICITY
The largest ethnic group in Mozambique is Macua-Lomwe who mainly live north of the
Zambezi River. This group accounts for around 40 percent of the total population. The other
main ethnic groups are the Tsonga in the southern lowlands, the Chopi and Tonga along the
coast and around Inhambane, the Shona in the central areas and the Makonde in the province
of Cabo Delgado. Mozambicans have been mixing with different cultures for centuries and
have absorbed many different characteristics and customs. Arabs had been trading and living
along the coast for hundreds of years before the arrival of the Portuguese, and when the new
colonisers arrived they quickly settled and intermarried, creating a rich cultural mix.
Mozambicans today reflect that melding of races.
The diversity of population is reflected in the variety of languages spoken. Approximately 60
languages and dialects are spoken. The official language is Portuguese although only about 10
percent of Mozambicans speak it as their first language. The main local languages are Macua
(38%), Tsonga (24%), and Sena (10%).
2.3 GENDER
Most Mozambican ethnic groups are patrilineal. Although most ethnic groups are patrilineal,
the prevalence of male migration necessitates that in many rural areas particularly in the
southern region of Mozambique, women run their families and livings. In Zambezia Province
the introduction of the prazos, the semi-feudal system for administration for several hundred
years of Portuguese dominance, was based on inheritance through the female line. FRELIMO
as part of the liberation struggle promoted concepts related to the equality of women. With
independence in 1975 these progressive attitudes towards the role of women continued

IMPACTO
including the introduction of new laws, which attempted to enshrine protection of rights for
women.
Despite the advancement of the rights of women under independent administration,
Mozambican girls and women do less well than boys and men. Maternal mortality rate is high
at 1,100 per 100,000 births. Access to health services directed specifically at women is
generally very poor. Literacy rates for women are much lower than for men. Family law in
Mozambique still discriminates against women. A married woman has limited rights to make
independent economic decisions or enjoy full ownership of assets. A widow's rights to
inheritance are secondary to males in the family. Girls in rural areas in general marry young,
often as soon as they reach puberty.

IMPACTO
3 ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS
3.1 ECONOMY
Mozambique made significant economic and social progress in the years immediately
following independence in 1975 particularly in terms of rapidly rising literacy rates.
Unfortunately the on-set of armed conflict rapidly eroded any gains made and ultimately
resulted to the collapse of the economy and civil society in general.  The eventual
establishment of the peace accords of October 1992 left Mozambique with devastating
physical, social, and economic damage. Economic damages were estimated at more than $20
billion (10 times the annual GDP in 1992).
Mozambique has undergone a period of significant economic recovery since the signing of the
peace accord in 1992. The annual growth rate, as defined by gross domestic product (GDP), in
the past three years has been calculated at 8.8, 9.7 and 7.3 percent, respectively. Annual
inflation has fallen from a level of almost 50 percent in 1996 to a current level of below 6
percent.
Despite the progress made, post-war reconstruction has still not been completed. Infrastructure
remains generally poor. Floods, such as those that occurred in southern Mozambique in
February 2000, set farmers, fishermen and other small businesses back many years. Many
believe Mozambique will continue to need high levels of international assistance to complete
reconstruction and to build a more robust base for the kind of development that is essential to
ending acute poverty.
A major privatisation programme was begun in 1990 and, by the end of the decade, 1,200
firms had been privatised. Most large companies, including those in the banking, brewing and
cement production sectors, were taken over by foreign firms. Many smaller companies were,
however, sold to local entrepreneurs. Private management of core state services is another
aspect of the ongoing structural reform programme as well as seeking foreign management
support. Examples include the assistance given to Mozambique customs, foreign management
of the urban water supply and the State Telephone Company. Private management of ports
and railways is now being organised but also in a way that maintains some Mozambican
interest.
Foreign investment has grown rapidly. In the seven years 1993-1999, $4.2 billion in foreign
investments were approved, $1.2 billion in foreign direct investment and $3 billion in loans.
Implementation has been slower with only $294 million actually spent in 1998 ($213 million
in investment and $81 million in private sector credit). In 1999, work started on the $1.3
billion Mozal aluminium smelter, by far Mozambique's largest investment project. The
project was commissioned in September 2000. In large part due to Mozal, 1999 saw $348
million in actual foreign direct investment and $495 million in foreign loans to the private
sector. Mozal alone is believed to account for more than 2 percent of the 7.3 percent per capita
GDP growth rate for 1999, leading to fears that growth is increasingly being generated by large
projects.

IMPACTO
Neighbouring South Africa accounts for nearly one half of the foreign investment, either
directly or via British-based companies. South African investment is split between large
projects like Mozal, privatisation of the breweries and small tourism and industry projects.
France and Portugal are the other two large investors. Concern is growing inside Mozambique
about the increasing dominance of foreign investors and contractors, which are stronger, better
capitalised and more experienced than domestic firms are. There is an acknowledged need for
support to the emerging indigenous private sector.
Traditional exports, notably prawns, cashew nuts and cotton, have remained steady over the
past three years, at $230 million per year. The Cahora Bassa dam located in Tete Province
began exporting power to South Africa and Zimbabwe in 1998 and electricity export earnings
jumped to $52 million in 1999. Service income from transport and tourism also stabilised at
$130 million a year. Exports of goods and services cover only one half of imports, excluding
capital imports for the big projects.
Aid remains absolutely essential to the Mozambican economy, and development assistance
levels are falling more slowly than had been predicted. Grants and loans to Mozambique
declined from $1,141 million in 1995 to $835 million in 1998 and are believed to have fallen
to $800 million in 1999. With the near total phasing-out of emergency assistance, food aid and
resettlement assistance, there has been a shift towards longer-term development goals. Of
assistance provided in 1998, $593 million (71 percent) was grants, of which $448 million was
bilateral, $93 million from the European Union and $52 million from the United Nations
system. The remaining $238 million comprised loans, of which $133 million came from the
World Bank. One third of donations and all loans are for investment projects; nearly one third
of grants is direct balance-of-payment support to the Government. Mozambique remains one
of the most aid-dependent countries in the world, but declining levels and the recalculation of
GDP means that aid in 1999 was only 19 percent of GDP, compared to 49 percent in 1995.
This is still well above the average for sub-Saharan Africa (7 percent in 1997) and for low
human development countries (10 percent in 1997).
Debt relief under the first phase of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative was
granted in mid-1999. More debt relief was granted than had been proposed in 1998 because
the international financial institutions had overestimated Mozambique's export growth;
roughly one half of Mozambique's public and publicly guaranteed debt was cancelled. In
1998, Mozambique had been scheduled to pay $344 million in debt service (interest and
principal repayments) but paid only $104 million. After HIPC debt relief, the debt service
payments in 2000 will be $76 million, a real gain of $28 million, although not enough to cover
the fall in aid. Mozambique is expected to have a further amount of debt cancelled in 2000
under the modified Cologne terms of HIPC, which could bring debt-service payments in 2001
down to $57 million.
The banking system, although now privatised, remains concentrated at Maputo. It has so far
proved unable to mobilise national savings or to lend effectively to entrepreneurs and small
businesses in rural areas, which will be key to development. Interest rates remain prohibitively
high (22 percent compared to inflation of under 6 percent). In general the business sector in
Mozambique remains weak, having not recovered from skill deficits and the decapitalization
caused by the war.

IMPACTO
Tax revenues remain at about 11.5 percent of GDP. Government current expenditure rose
from 9.5 percent of GDP in 1997 to 10.6 percent in 1999, and the levels are rising slowly.
There was substantial growth in 1999 because of an increase in the minimum wage and an
increase in civil service salaries. The Mozambican Human Rights League identified prevailing
low wages as the main cause of growing petty corruption. Health and education spending have
risen rapidly, while military spending has been falling since the end of the war. In 1999, the
Government expected to spend $96 million on recurrent education costs (such as teachers'
salaries), $89 million on defence and security, $86 million on debt service (after having been
granted HIPC debt relief) and $57 million on recurrent health costs.
3.2 POVERTY
Poverty in Mozambique has been defined as the inability of individuals to ensure for
themselves and their dependents a set of minimum basic conditions for their subsistence
(Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, (1998), Programmea Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Agrario (PROAGRI): Vol. I,II,e III). Although Mozambique's economy grew rapidly during
the last six years, poverty levels remain some of the highest in the world. Average monthly
consumption was estimated to be Mtl60,780 or about $170 per capita per year in 1998. In
accordance with the overall economic growth per capita income in Mozambique in 1999 had
risen to $230.
Mozambique was ranked 169 of 174 countries in the human development index for 1997.
Increasing life expectancy, higher enrolment rates and rising GDP are beginning to push up the
human development index at an increasing rate, with improvements of more than 3.5 percent
expected for both 1998 and 1999. Mozambique is well below the sub-Saharan average for
most development indicators. Approximately two-thirds (69%) of the population fall into the
category of poor (live on an income of less than US$1 a day), one-third of the population is
considered to be very poor, which translated into monetary terms means they live on less than
40 US cents a day.

IMPACTO
The First National Poverty and Well-being Assessment, published in 1999, showed that 69
percent of all Mozambicans live in poverty, with poverty higher in rural areas (71 percent) than
in urban areas (62 percent).  There are considerable variations in poverty rates across
Mozambique. The Central Region has the highest poverty rate (74 percent). The poorest
Provinces in Mozambique are Sofala (92 percent), Tete (82 percent), and Inhambane (82
percent). These figures are approximately the same as those published for 1997.
There is a strong relationship between education and poverty. There is a particularly strong
correlation between the education of the household head and the poverty of the household:
families whose head has a better education tend to be less poor. The Government of
Mozambique has set a target to reduce poverty by the year 2010 by about 30%. In order to
achieve this reduction Action Guidelines have been produced which include:
u Maintain rapid and sustainable economic growth
u Priority to human capital
u Increase agricultural production particularly in the family-sector
o Develop infrastructure in the rural areas
n Protect the most vulnerable groups of society through social security and assistance
programmes
o_ Promote employment
u  Improve technical and administrative capacity to monitor poverty

4 SERVICES
4.1 ACCESS TO SERVICES
Table 5 summarises access to a range of services.
Access to basic communications services, such as a post office or public telephone, is
extremely limited, with only three percent of rural households living in villages with such
services. The most commonly available services are markets and transportation services.
Distances to medical services other than traditional healers are long, averaging 20 to 30
kilometres, and reaching an average of 45 kilometres to a doctor. Below twenty percent of
rural households live in villages with a nurse, midwife, health post, or health centre and only
two percent of households live in a village with a doctor. There are differences across the
country with the Central Region having the poorest access to health services and the Southern
region the best.

IMPACTO
Access to clean drinking water for most Mozambicans is a major problem. Currently only 12
percent of the rural population have access to a piped water supply and 31 percent have a
latrine in their home, compared to 66 and 68 percent, respectively, in urban areas.
4.2 EDUCATION
Mozambique's education system is divided into pre-primary school and educational schools.
Schools consist of general, technical or professional, and higher education. General education
consists of two levels, primary and secondary. Primary education consists of seven years of
schooling divided into two levels. Level 1 up to grade 5 (EPI) and level two from grade 6 to 7
(EP2).  Secondary education consists of five years divided into two cycles, first cycle
secondary from grade 8 to 10 (ESGI) and second cycle from grade 11 to 12 (ESG2).
Approximately two-thirds (68%) of households live in villages with a primary school. In
contrast, only two percent of households live in villages with a secondary school as shown in
Table 6.

Table 7 shows that for adults aged between 18 to 65 the national literacy rate is 40 percent, but
much lower for females at 23.6 percent. The group with the lowest level literacy rates is
females in rural areas where only 15.7 percent are literate. Enrolment rates for children
between 7-11 years are shown in Table 8. 49.2 of this group are enrolled in schools with lower

IMPACTO
4.3 HEALTH
Mozambican life expectancy at birth is estimated to be 42 years. Infant mortality per 1,000
live births is 134. Malaria, measles, diarrhoea, and acute respiratory infections are the biggest
killers of children. Nutritional status is low with national estimates of stunted growth high at
10.8 percent of infants indicating excessive levels of malnutrition. One of every six children
born in Mozambique has a low birth weight, defined as less than 2.5 kilograms. Low birth
weight typically reflects poor health or nutritional status of the mother during pregnancy.
The war cut Mozambique off from the neighbouring States, and delayed the arrival of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic, although the return of refugees and the new opening to trade led to rapid
change. Malaria remains a bigger killer, and adult HIV infection rates are about 15 percent,
significantly less than in some neighbouring States (South Africa 25%, Zimbabwe 26% and
Malawi 23%). Mozambique, however, proved unable to make the maximum use of the extra
window of opportunity, and HIV/AIDS gained real prominence as an issue only in 1999. One
reason was the rising death rate, at present over 60,000 per year, and the recent
acknowledgement of AIDS as the cause of death in the obituaries of prominent people.
The national strategic plan to combat sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS was
approved in 1999, and aims to keep HIV/AIDS levels at 17 percent of the adult population.
Even so, the impact of the rising incidence of HIV/AIDS on the country will be dramatic. In
the absence of effective and timely measures to curb the spread of the virus, new projections
suggest that by 2005 there will be 150,000 adult deaths and 20,000 child deaths each year.
This will actually reduce life expectancy in Mozambique from the present 42 years to 37 years,
and will halve the rate of population growth. The number of orphans caused by AIDS will
exceed 700,000 by 2005. The economic impact is expected to be significant; peasant-farming
families (the majority of the population) will have fewer workers and more dependants, while
industry and the state apparatus will lose skilled people.
The focus of the new strategy is to target people who have casual sexual relations (an
estimated 1.6 million in 1999) and those living with HIV/AIDS (approximately 15% or 2.6
million of the population) and to ensure access to essential and high-quality prevention
methods. This involves more work with vulnerable groups, high-risk groups, such as the
young and highly mobile people, and more inter-ministerial co-operation to involve sectors
such as education, agriculture, youth and others as part of setting up channels to reach all target
groups. Promotion of condom use, sex education, treatment for sexually transmitted diseases,
counselling and voluntary testing and strengthening the negotiating power of women and girls
are seen as essential. The aims of the national strategy seem modest, for example, to have one
third of adults using condoms during casual sexual relationships.

5 LIVELIHOOD STRATEGIES
5.1 AGRICULTURE
An estimated 80 percent of Mozambicans live in rural areas. Of this group, 98.5 percent have
at least some land and 90 percent gain most of their living through subsistence agriculture.
Most farmers have only a hoe as their main farming implement and fewer than 10 percent use
fertiliser or incorporate irrigation practices. Raising the productivity of peasant farmers is
considered critical to combating poverty, and securing their land occupancy rights is seen as
the essential first step. Table 9 summarises farm details.

Maize is the most commonly grown crop, grown by approximately 75 percent of households
who produce crops. Cassava is grown by 60 percent of households who have agricultural land.
Just over 50 percent of households who have land grow beans. About 25 to 30 percent of
households in rural areas produce horticultural crops. Table 10 summarises the average yield
of important crops across the country.

IMPACTO
The food security and nutritional status of inhabitants in the Northern Region of Mozambique
are the highest in the country due to the occurrence of relatively fertile soils and good rain
conditions. The Central and Southern Regions are characterised by lower food security and
nutritional status due to poor soils and lower rainfall amounts. Farm sizes in the Northern
region on average are greater (greater than 2 ha) than the Central and Southern regions (less
than I ha). Poor agricultural production over large areas of the country has resulted in the
dynamic that 98 percent of crop production is subsistence and small holder based with only 16
percent of households having a surplus stock of produce to sell commercially.
Table 11 summarises the national figures for areas cultivated by crop and total production for
the growing season 1999 to 2000. The most important crop in terms of total area cultivated is
maize followed by cassava but cassava is more important in terms of yield than maize.

Livestock production occurs to a much greater extent in the Southern region where over 60
percent of the cattle populations occur.
Limited livestock numbers and poor agricultural productivity has resulted in a population that
has developed livelihood strategies that rely on natural resources. Such dependency is high
with 85 percent of the energy and between 30 percent and 70 percent of the protein
requirements of rural communities being derived from the natural resource base.  The
utilisation and trade of wildmeat constitutes a significant input to many rural household
economies. During the early 1990's it was estimated that about five million people in
Mozambique were dependent upon wildlife for meat protein, with rural communities deriving
between 40 percent and 80 percent of their protein requirements from bushmeat.
5.2 OTHER LIVELIHOOD STRATEGIES
Historically migration of a male member of a family has been a major livelihood strategy for
families particularly living in the Southern Region of Mozambique. During the second half of
the 1900's Mozambicans began labour migration to the South Africa mines. At its peak,
between 1950 and 1970, Mozambican migrant labour in South Africa was around 800,000
workers while the total number of migrants was over one million workers. Since the end of the
1980s the number of mine workers has fallen dramatically as the South African mining
industry has restructured. Currently there are probably only about ten thousand Mozambican
miners in South Africa. Although the numbers of Mozambican miners working in South
Africa is small in comparison to historical peaks, the social and cultural impacts upon families

IMPACTO
is still considerable. These impacts are reflected in the desire of rural Mozambicans, in
particular young men, to migrate to South Africa as soon as possible. With the reduction of
opportunities in the mining sector, Mozambicans have moved into other sectors of the South
African economy.
As with the sectors of the South African economy Mozambicans have moved into, the patterns
and duration of migration have also changed. The major changes are the duration of migration
periods, which tend to be far shorter, and the increasing evidence of more female migration.
The economic and social impacts of labour migration are dramatic, but perhaps still
underestimated and under researched. For example, the current devastation caused by the
rapidly rising rate of HIV/AIDS infection it is suggested can be attributed in part to the
negative impacts of labour migration.

IMPACTO
6 ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL SITES
Mozambique has a rich archaeological and cultural heritage. Formalisation of archaeological
and cultural sites is however generally low.
Indigenous archaeological and cultural sites are numerous and correspond to the history of
Mozambique's many different ethnic groups. Most ethnic groups have sacred burial sites
normally used for Chief's and often located in well wooded or forest areas. In the higher areas
of Mozambique particularly in more mountainous Provinces such as Manica sacred cave sites
have been identified. Many ethnic groups identify sacred forests, usually the venue for a variety
of spiritual ceremonies by spirit mediums, chiefs and selected elders from the difference clans.
Any new road construction programme has to identify such sites with local populations to avoid
possible damage to local archaeological and cultural sites.
Sites such as forts exist up and down the coastline of Mozambique as testaments mainly to the
colonisation by the Portuguese from the 15th Century. Along the main rivers such as the
Zambezi there is also the remnants of forts and Portuguese colonial buildings. The only
internationally recognised cultural heritage site is Mozambique Island off the coast of Nampula
Province in the Northern Region of Mozambique.

1 VEGETATION AND FLORA
1.1 VEGETATION TYPE IDENTIFICATION
At a broad level of mapping 22 broad vegetation/habitat types can be distinguished in
Mozambique (Figure 1). The vegetation map and description of flora is based on mapping
units defined by Wild and Barbosa (1967). At a more detailed level of mapping many other
sub-habitats may be distinguished within these broad vegetation types.
In Mozambique the main vegetation type, in terms of structure, is savanna woodland. The
savanna experiences a distinct cooler and drier season (April to October) alternating with a
hotter and wetter season (November to March).
The most common woodland type (based on species composition) is miombo woodland.
Miombo is the term used to describe woodland types dominated by members of the genus
Brachystegia and/or closely related genera such as Julbernardia. Miombo covers most of
Zimbabwe and Zambia, is dominant in Malawi, Tanzania, Angola and Mozambique and occurs
in Botswana and Congo. In Mozambique miombo covers much of Niassa, Cabo Delgado,
Nampula, Zambezia, Sofala, Manica and Inhambane Provinces. There are several miombo
woodland type.
The second most extensive woodland type is mopane woodland occurring in the Limpopo-Save
area and in the mid-Zambezi Valley. Mopane woodland is dominated by the tree species
Colophospermum mopane. The typical mopane tree savanna is more or less open and occurs on
variable but generally calcareous soils.
Other woodland types include Acacia woodland (in drier southern and central areas) and sub-
littoral coastal woodland in southern coastal Mozambique.
Non-woodland vegetation types include:
o small "islands" of Afromontane habitats (forests and heaths) along the eastern border with
Zimbabwe and Malawi where the Mozambican plains rise up sharply to the western rim
of the great southern African plateau and other isolated montane areas;
o  inland halophytic communities in the valley of the Changane River, a tributary of the
Limpopo River;
o  freshwater swamps/sudd occur on the Mozambique-Malawi border the largest being
associated with Lake Chilwa;
o  vegetation formations on alluvial plains are predominant in the Zambezi, Limpopo and
Nkomati valleys;
o parabolic dune forests along the southern sector of the Mozambican coast; and
o  mangroves in sheltered bays, estuaries and deltas.
Because of their small extent mangroves are not shown in Figure 1. Mangrove distribution is
presented separately in Figures 3a, 3b and 3c.

1.2 DESCRIPTION OF VEGETATION TYPES
i   Libombos Woodland/Shrubland
This vegetation type occurs at moderate altitude between 350 and 800m on the Libombo and
Pequenos Libombos. Mountains on the border with Swaziland and South Africa. Annual
rainfall is 600-1200mm. The tree and shrubs of this type are generally secondary and include
Pterocarpus rotundifolius, Bauhinia galpinii, Peltophorum africanum, Acacia nigrescens, A.
swazica, A. caffra, Maerua rosmarinoides, etc. Olea africana is sometimes common on
slopes. There is a rich herbaceous flora.
Monospecific patches of Androstachysjohnsonii (the Libombo ironwood or "simbirre") occur
on rhyolitic soils near Goba within this vegetation type.
ii    Acacia Woodland
There are two extensive areas of Acacia woodland in Mozambique viz.:
A southern formation (in the area of Moamba, Magude and Guija) where Acacia nilotica
subsp. kraussiana, A. senegalense and A. nigrecens, are the main Acacia species.
A second large area occurs in central Mozambique running approximately in a north-east
direction through Manica and Sofala Provinces comprising communities of scattered trees and
shrubs where Acacia nigrescens is the dominant in the tree/shrub layer.
iii    Sublittoral Woodland and Forest
An Albizia-Afzelia-Sclerocarya mainly open woodland occurs between Maputo and Macia in
the sublittoral zone of Mozambique south of the R. Limpopo. Much of the natural woodland
has been replaced by small-scale farms especially adjacent to the ENI. Only wild species and
introduced tree species with edible fruits are left in the farming areas. Treeless secondary
regenerating vegetation is common on sandy soils and often Helichrysum kraussii is dominant.
In the south-eastern sublittoral region on Quatemary and Recent sand dunes (Bela Vista,
Salamanga and Zitundo) the Albizia-Afzelia-Sclerocarya formations are replaced by Syzygium-
Garcinia-Dialium formations. Patches of swamp forest occur scattered in the area south of the
Maputo Elephant Reserve. Swamp forests were never extensive and many have been drained and
cleared for agriculture. The remaining relicts rate top priority for conservation. True swamp forest
canopy tree are Ficus trichopoda, Syzygium cordatum, Voacanga thouarsii and Rauvolfla caffra.
iv    Mopane Woodland
Colophospermum mopane woodland, after miombo woodland, is the second most important
woodland type in Mozambique. Extensive mopane formations occur in two main areas, the
Zambezi valley and the area between the Limpopo and Save Rivers
58602 Annexure C                   December2000                                3

In the Zambezi valley the Colophospermum mopane woodland is usually medium or tall (10-
1 5m), almost pure but with some Adansonia digitata (baobob). The soils are brownish, clayey,
compact, with some calcareous material, relatively deep and mainly derived from Karroo
formations. In pans and depressions with calcareous soils grassland with Setaria species is
dominant.
In shallow, stony and also calcareous soils Acacia nigrescens (subdominant), Dalbergia
melanoxylon, Acacia nilotica, Combretum ghasalense, Dalbergia boehmii, Adansonia digitata,
(basbob) Albizia harveyi, Terminalia prunioides, T stuhlmannii, Ziziphus mucronata
(ma,anica), Combretum apiculatum, Afzelia quanzensis (chanfuta), etc. accompany the still
dominant mopane.
On the banks of the Zambezi River the mopane is often replaced by Ziziphus mauritiana,
Diospyros mespiliformis and sometimes Berchemia discolor.
The mopane woodland between the Limpopo (including it's tributary the Elefantes River) and
Save River basins occur on mainly on Quaternary calcareous soils. Annual rainfall is irregular
and light, being less than 400mm and decreasing inland.
The typical mopane tree savanna is more or less open. Accompanying species are Ximenia
americana, Salvadora angustifolia var australis, Azima tetracantha, Adenium obesum var.
multiflorum, Boscia albitrunca, Pachypodium saundersii, Dombeya kirkii, Sansevieria spp.,
Euphorbia spp., Courbonia glauca, etc.
Within the main mopane savanna patches of other associations occur. These are too small to be
mapped and include:
o Tree savanna with Guibourtia conjugata frequent on in light sandy soils.
o Patches of dry Androstachysjohnsonii (ironwood) woodland on reddish brown sandy soils.
o Julbernardia globiflora woodland with Brachystegia glaucescens on shallow soils on
stony slopes and outcrops.
o Patches of tree-shrub Acacia woodland Acacia goetzei or A. nigrescens, or A. senegal
communities.
o In drier alluvial areas on the valley floors of the large rivers are formations containing
Acacia nigrescens. These are very tall in the alluvium of the Elefantes River.
v    Lowland Palm Savanna
This vegetation occurs in coastal areas of Nampula, Sofala and Inhambane Province. It
occupies badly drained lowland, sublittoral zones with an abundance of palm and grading
usually into savanna woodlands. Palm species include: Phoenix reclinata, Hyphaene crinita
and Borassus aethiopum. In pools and swamps occurs Phragmites communis, Hydrocotyle sp.,
Nymphaeae capensis, Cyperus, etc.

vi   Deciduous Miombo Woodland
Several types of deciduous miombo woodland are found in Mozambique distinguished by
species composition.
Deciduous miombo Woodland occurs on Sul do Save Sands (Brachystegia spiciformis). This
formation is found on sandy sub-littoral soils between Xai-Xai and Nova Mambone and may
become very dense.
A mosaic Berlinia orientalis, Brachystegia spiciformis-Pteleopsis occupies the sub-littoral
zone of Northern Mozambique between Macomia-Mipande and Palma-Pundanhar at low
altitudes, generally below 200m.
A  mosaic Adansonia, Sterculia, Pteleopsis, Millettia-Brachystegia spp., Julbernardia
globiflora type occurs in the north-east of Mozambique in a belt between the sublittoral
lowlands and the beginning of the mesoplanaltic zone between Matibane (Nacala) and
Macomia. There is also a small patch in the extreme north-east between Pundanhar and
Quionga, near the Rovuma River, at altitude between 50 and 250m.
A Julbernardia, Brachystegia, Ostryoderris, Sclerocarya, Pterocarpus, Albizia, etc. deciduous
miombo is confined to the sublittoral zone from Nova Sofala to Mambone between the Buzi
River.
vii   Dry Deciduous Miombo
Dry deciduous miombo (Southern Sub-littoral Urrongas) comprising Brachystegia spiciformis
- Julbernardia globiflora in a mosaic with deciduous forest of Afzelia - Sideroxylon - Balanites
occurs on the mottled red or reddish-brown soils of the Urrongas region between Inhambane
and Mambone. This vegetation type occupies much of the centre of Inhambane and occurs
inland from the Deciduous Miombo described above. It consists of species such as Julbernardia
globiflora, Pterocarpus angolensis, Burkea africana, Albizia versicolor, Afzelia quanzensis,
Sclerocarya birrea, Strychnos spp., Strophanthus spp., and Securidaca longipedunculata
A Julbernardia type occurs in the Provinces of Manica and Sofala, Tete and Zambezia In
Manica and Sofala Provinces it occupies the northern slope of the valley of the R. Save.
A Brachystegia boehmii, B. allenii, Julbernardia-Adansonia mosaic formation covers the
lower valleys of the rivers of the northern portion of Mozambique northwards from the R.
Lurio and the subplanaltic areas between 150 and 700m.
viii   Tardily Deciduous Miombo - Lowland Type
There are various types of Lowland Tardily Deciduous Miombo.
Brachystegia spiciformis, B. boehmiii, Julbernardia globiflora type.
This type occurs in Zambezia Province, i.e., in Baixa Zambezia from Derre to Ligonha and the
Moma region between elevations of 100 and 200m.
Brachystegia boehmii, Julbernardia, Hirtella-Parinari, Protea, Philippia type.

The miombo element consists of Brachystegia boehmii, Julbernardia globiflora, Hirtella
zanguebarica and a poorly drained tree/shrub savanna of Parinari, Protea, Philippia, etc. This
type is found in the sublittoral zones north of Maganja da Costa and Namacurra to Moma.
Brachystegia spiciformis, B. boehmii-Adansonia, Sterculia type
This type covers the sub-planaltic zone between 50 and 500m. especially in the sub-littoral
areas from Angoche to Namapa in soils which are generally red to grey and derived from
granite, gneiss. Annual rainfall is about 1000mm.
ix    Tardily Deciduous Miombo (North-Eastern Median Altitude)
(Brachystegia utilis, B. boehmii, B. spiciformis and Brachystegia spp.).
This type covers the large meso-planaltic areas above 500m in the north of Mozambique i.e in
the regions of Alto Lugenda, Maua, Marrupa, Nungo and along the slopes to Balama and Alto
Mesalo as well as along the mountain ridge to the Macondes plateau. Annual rainfall is
between 900-1400mm.
x    Semi-Moist Deciduous Miombo (Median Altitude)
Brachystegia spiciformis-Julbernardia globiflora savanna woodland is very important on the
plateaux of Manica and Sofala Provinces; it covers a great part of Zambezia Province and
stretches over extensive areas north of the Ligonha River.
xi   High Rainfall Moist Miombo Woodland
This type of Brachystegia spiciformis woodland merges with the mesoplanaltic semi-
deciduous forests of Pteleopsis, Erythrophleum and Newtonia. It occurs in the Chimoio plateau
and on the higher parts of the Zambezia Province.
xii   Deciduous (Basement Complex) Woodland
(Pteleopsis-Combretum-Pericopsis-Acacia)
There are two important areas of this type represented in Figure 1. One is found north of
Molumbo near the Malawi border in the Amaramba slopes facing the Lake Chilwa depression
and the other in a similar region near the Lugenda River extending from Malawi.
xiii   Mixed Baobab Woodland
This woodland type occurs along a zone of medium altitude (about 500 - 600 m.) between the
southern margin of the Zambezi Valley and the Barue plateau north of Mungari on formations
derived from granites and gneisses or from post-Karroo lava. It comprises Adansonia digitata,
Sterculia africana, Kirkia acuminata, Cordyla africana, Sterculia apendiculata, Milletia
stuhlmanni, Lonchocarpus capassa, Otryoderris stuhlmanni,Sclerocarya birrea etc.

This formation grades into (eastwards) a dry deciduous tree or shrub savanna (sub-planaltic)
comprising Adansonia, Sterculia-Acacia nigrescens, Pterocarpus brenanii-Diplorhynchus.
xiv    Moist Forest/Woodland
(Pteleopsis myrtifolia-Erythrophleum suavelons- Brachystegia)
Mixed formations of dense semi-deciduous tall forest, at low altitudes, of Pteleopsis
myrtifolia-Erythrophleum suavelons with Hirtella zanguebarica; forming a mosaic with the
catena facies of Brachystegia spiciformis-Julbernardia globiflora occupy the sublittoral central
zone in two belts to the north and south of the Zambezi delta, e.g., in the south from Beira
(Cheringoma) to Inhaminga and Marromeu, and in the north in the areas of Nicuadala,
Namacurra and Maganja da Costa. The forests on the Cheringoma plateau represent the best
hardwood production forests in Moambique.
xv    Moist Semi-Deciduous Forests of the Mesoplanaltic Slopes and Lowlands of
Eastern Mozambique -
(Pteleopsis myrtifolia, Erythrophleum, Newtonia or Millettia).
In this group are included two subtypes as follows:
Pteleopsis myrtifolia, Erithrophleum suaveolens forests with an abundance of Newtonia
buchananii are typical of the subplanaltic slopes of Manica and Sofala.
Similar forests but with Newtonia buchananii rare or absent are typical of the slopes of the
Macondes plateau in Cabo Delagado Province.
xvi   Littoral Thicket and Forest of Recent Dunes
This vegetation type occurs on recent dunes formed from sands of aeolian origin. The most
extensive formation of this type occurs along the parabolic dune coast between Ponto do Ouro
and Bazaruto Island. Some of the highest vegetated dunes in the world are reported to occur
along this stretch of coast. Dominant tree species include Diospyros rotundifolia, Euclea
natalensis, Mimusops caffra, and Apodytes dimidiata. Figure 2 shows a typical dune
vegetation transect .

(Widdringtonia, Podocarpus or Juniperus).
In Mozambique this type is restricted. It is found the Chimanimani and Tsetsera Mountains
(Manica Province) between 1500 and 2000m where Podocarpus milanjianus is frequent.
Widdringtonia cupressoides is found in the same areas as well as at Rotanda and Mavita. Both
species also inhabit the southeast slope of the Gorongosa Mountain. Podocarpus milanjianus
also occurs on the slopes of Gurue Mt. in Zambezia Province and on Domue Mt. at 1850m.
near Metengo-Balama, Angonia, Tete Province.
xviii   Moist Evergreen Forest
(Maranthes polyandra, Khaya, Aphloia, Macaranga).
Relict areas of this type exist mainly below the dry conifer montane forests on the slopes of the
Chimanimani, Inyanga and Gorongosa Mountains. Some of the principal tree species include
Erythrophleum suaveolens, Blighia ungugata, Zanha golungensis, Melanodiscus oblongus.
Similar forest patches are found on the slopes and gullies of the mountains at medium altitudes
between 1200 and 1600m where annual rainfall is about 1700 to 2000mm. Examples occur in
Zambezia, especially in Gurue, Milange, Tacuane, Metolola-Chiperone and in smaller patches
at Namarr6i, Morrumbala, etc.
xix    Vegetation on Saline Soils
A large expanse this inland halophytic type is found in the valley of the Changane River, a
tributary of the Limpopo. Annual rainfall is about 500mm. The soils are known locally as

"tonga". These areas are arid and uninhabited. In areas of high salinity trees are virtually
absent. The flora is strongly halophytic with succulent, creeping plants of Arthrocnemum sp.
Chenolea and Salicornia and scattered bushes of Atriplex, Suaeda, etc.
xx    Vegetation on Alluviums
The largest extent of this vegetation type occurs in the lower Zambezia River/Delta system. In
the higher and better drained zones the alluviums may support a tree/shrub savanna (mainly
Acacia spp.). Grasses mainly belong to the Paniceae. In badly drained areas trees such as Ficus
spp., Kigelia and Pandanus may be present. In swampy depressions or around lagoons are
palm communities with Borassus aethiopum, Hyphaene crinita, H. coriacea or Phoenix
reclinata.
Extensive moist grasslands occur in low-lying badly drained areas with Setaria spp. dominant
and Ischaemum afrum very common. In the Zambezi delta, in very wet localities, elephant
grass (Pennisetum purpureum) is common.
Aquatic flora of swamps and lagoons comprise floating species such as Eichhornia crassipes,
Pistia stratiotes and Trapa natalensis (the least common). The zone with plants having
submerged or growing at lagoon edges are Phragmites spp, Cyperus papyrus, Nymphaea spp,
Typha latipholia subsp. capensis, Cyperus esculentus, C. rotundus, Marsilea, Scirpus spp,
Ludwigia spp, and Paspalidium platyrachis.
The lower Limpopo and Nkomati riverine systems are characterized by a fringing riverine
forest comprising Ficus spp. (usually dominant), Trichilia emetica, Kigelia africana, Lannea
stuhlmanii and Xanthocerra zambeziaca. Behind this fringe extensive grasslands with scattered
trees occur periodically flooded, badly drained alluviums. Tree species include: Acacia albida,
Diospyros mespiliformis, Ficus sycomorus, Ficus glumosa, Lonchocarpus capassa and
Cordyla africana.
A seasonally-inundated lowland formation (the Gorongosa "tandos") links the Zambezi
Valley with the Pungue system in the south via the Urema trough (Rift Valley). Tree species
include Acacia spp. and Hyphaene sp.
xxi   Swamp/Sudd
Sudd is well developed on the shores of Lake Chilwa (bordering with Malawi) and consists of
Cyperus papyrus, other Cyperus spp., and Phragmites reed beds.
xxii   Mangroves
Mangrove forests are floristically well developed in the northem and central sectors of the
coast and less so along the southem sector. Estimates made in 1992 based on satellite imagery
indicated that the mangroves cover 396,080 ha in Mozambique. This represents a reduction of
3.9% since 1972 (Saket and Matusse, 1994). The distribution of mangroves along the
Mozambican coast is shown on Figures 3a, 3b and 3c.

Three main coastal types can be distinguished in Mozambique viz. the northern coral coastline,
the central swamp and delta coastline and the southern parabolic dune coastline. The mangroves
associated with each of these coastlines are described below:
(a) Northern Sector: c. 770km between Rovuma River in the north to the Primeiro/Segundo
Archipelago in the south (17209: covering entire coast of Cabo Delgado Province and the
coastline of Nampula Province to Mossuril.
The northern coastal sector which runs almost N-S between the Tanzanian border and the town
of Mossuril is highly indented with several small bays, including Pemba Bay. Other small bays
and river mouths are sheltered by sandy spits on their southern sides.
Ten major streams enter in this sector and tidal forests are confined to the vicinities of their
mouths as well as to the shores of bays and along salt-water creeks that may penetrate several
kilometres inland. In creek mangroves Rhizophora mucronata and Sonneratia alba line the
canals behind which Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and Xylocarpus granatum may dominate In drier
sites thickets of Ceriops tagal (often stunted) may form broad belts. These may give way to a
dwarf Avicennia marina zone.
Further inland the mangrove is replaced by large expanses of highly saline tidal flats. Salt pans
for the commercial production of salt are located in these areas. Well developed creek
mangrove formations occur in Nacala Bay, on the mainland in the Lumbo/Mossuril Districts
opposite Ilha de Mocambique and Mecufi south of Pemba.
(b) Central Sector: c. 970 km between Angoche (16 14'S) and Bazaruto Island (21 10'S):
Covering southern coast of Nampula Province and entire coastlines of Zambezia and Sofala
Provinces.
Between Mossuril (Nampula Province) and Quelimane (Zambezia Province) the coastline
comprises many small deltas interspersed by sandy strips. A dozen major streams reach the coast
here, including the Meluli, Ligonha, Molocue, Licungo and Luala.
Mangroves are especially well developed near Angoche (1610'S/3958'E) on the Meluli Delta,
near Moma (1646'S/3910'E) at the mouth of Ligonha, near Nova Naburi (1647'S/38052'E) at
the mouth of the Molucue River, near Moebase (1704'S/3841'E) at the mouth of the M'lela
(1708'S/38034'E) and at the mouth of the Raraga River (1753'S/3657'E) on the Luala Estuary.
These rivers are tidal for many kilometres upstream. Mangroves are continuous along the open
coast in places; elsewhere they occur immediately behind low coastal dunes.
Mangroves spread laterally along tributaries, which enter the main streams parallel to the coast, a
situation best seen at the Raraga Mouth north of Quelimane.
The Zambezi River discharges via distributaries through a wide swampy delta. Mangrove swamps
are extensive in the lower delta, but they do not extend up the main channels for more than 15 km,
although the tide penetrates much farther than this.
South of the Zambezi, the alluvium from no less than 18 rivers has produced a continuously
deltaic coast as far as Beira 1949'S/34052'E), and mangroves here occur on the open sea coast.
They are also present in depressions behind frontal sand dunes, and along the numerous channels

which gives the coast a scalloped appearance. Mangroves are also prolific south of Beira, for a
distance of some 160km, on a stretch, highly indented, and island dotted coast. This is fed with
alluvium and freshwater by six major rivers including the Pungue, Buzi, Gorongosa and Save,
which drain the central western highlands. At the mouth of the Pungue River, at Beira, a vast
swamp some 50km deep and 27 km long reaches inland from the south bank of the river.
Coastal swamps are extensive at the mouth of the Buzi River, and there is a particularly fine
stand at Novo Sofala Bay (201O'S/3440'E). They continue down the coast, in a belt traversed
by a dozen small streams, to the delta of the Save River.
The delta of the Save is covered by mangroves, and tides penetrate far upstream. Swamps and
lagoons fringe the lowest 30 - 40 km of the river. This extremely swampy section of the coast
ends at Macavane (21028'S/35'04'E) where the Govuro River enters the head of a bay behind the
spectacular spit of Bartolomeu Dias. This river is entirely coastal and flows parallel to the coast
from S-N. The landward side of Bartolomeu Dias Bay is deeply dissected, deltaic, and covered
with tidal forests where nine small streams enter the bayside, but the great spit itself is sandy with
only a few mangroves.
The tidal forests between Beira and Macavane are the richest in Mozambique, and are probably
among the richest on the entire East African seaboard.
(c) Southern Sector: c. 850 km from Bazaruto Island southward to Ponta de Ouro: covering
most of the coastline of Inhambane Province and the entire coastlines of Gaza and Maputo
Provinces.
The most well developed mangrove systems occur in Maputo Bay, Inhambane Bay, the
Morrumbene estuary and Bazaruto Bay. In Maputo Bay the largest mangrove formations occur
along the sheltered western shore of the Machangulo Peninsula, the southern shore of the Bay and
the Nkomati estuary.
Mangroves near to Maputo and Matola have been devastated. The Costa do Sol mangrove has all
but disappeared.

1.2 FOREST COVER
A total of 19,054,000 hectares has been identified as high and medium potential for forest
production based on the forestry maps and a preliminary forest inventory. The areas of forest
production potential occur mainly in the northern and central provinces (Saket and Matusse,
1994). Areas of production forest per province are given in Table 1.

The distribution of medium and high potential production forest is shown in Figure 4. A dense
forest formation occurs on the Cheringoma Plateau between Beira and Caia in Sofala
Province. Large forest areas also occur in Cabo Delgado and Niassa Provinces.
The most commercially valuable hardwood tree species occurring in these forests include
Pterocarplus angolensis (umbila), A,illetia stulhmannii (panga panga), Afzelia quazensis
(chamfuta), Dalbergia melanoxylon, Khaya nyasica and Berchemnia discolor. All these species
are being heavily exploited in Mozambique. A list of the more important commercial tree
species is given in Table 2.

1.3 PLANT CONSERVATION STATUS
Due to the long period of civil unrest, together with the vast size of the country and lack of
trained personnel and operational support, large areas of Mozambique are poorly documented
from a biological perspective. The current conservation status of Mozambique's flora is
therefore, imprecisely known. A preliminary estimate indicates that, of the 5500 plant species
recorded for Mozambique, some 247 plant species in 67 families may be of conservation
concern.
Areas with large numbers of endemic plant species include Afromontane areas (e.g. the
vegetation of the Chimanimani and Gorongosa Mountains) and southern Mozambique. The
latter is known as the Maputaland Centre (MC) of Endemism and contains an estimated 2000
to 3000 species of vascular plants which at least 168 species/infraspecific taxa and 4 genera are
endemic/near-endemic (van Wyk 1994). The biological importance of these areas is discussed
further in Chapter 4 "Areas of Outstanding Value".

Although there are a large a large number of mammal species the populations of these species,
especially the larger mammals, have been significantly reduced both inside and outside of
protected areas due to lack of enforcement during the armed conflict (1981 - 1992).
The Gorongosa National Park, suffered massive declines in large mammal populations. The
number of elephant, prior to the conflict was in the order of 3000 whilst in 1994 only 108
elephants were recorded during an aerial survey. Similar massive declines were recorded for
buffalo (from 14,000 in 1979 to zero in 1994), hippo (form 4800 in 1979 to zero in 1994),
wildebeest (from 5500 in 1968 to zero in 1994) and waterbuck (3500 in 1988 to 129 in 1994).
Similar trends were observed for Marromeu Buffalo Reserve originally famous for it's large
herds of buffalo and elephants.
These data are based on aerial transect surveys and uncounted populations may still occur in
wooded areas. Recent information indicates the large mammal populations are recovering in
the Gorongosa National Park and Marromeu Reserve.
Niassa Reserve in northern Mozambique (frontier with Tanzania) was less affected by the
armed conflict. This is the only protected area that still supports significant populations of
large mammals. A survey carried out in 1997 revealed the presence of large populations of
elephants, buffalo, sable antelope and greater kudu and leopards. Three endemic large mammal
subspecies occur in the area:
o  the blue Niassa Wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinusjohnstoni) which is characterized by a
white band across the muzzle (believed to be endangered);
Li a sub-species of Burchell's Zebra (Equus burchelli subsp. bohmi); and
O Johnson's Impala (Aepyceros melampus - subsp. Johnstoni), considered to be rare.
Population data of selected large mammal species in the Niassa Reserve area are presented
below:
o  the elephant (Loxodonta africana). The population in the Niassa Reserve and Buffer Zone
may be one of the largest in Africa. Preliminary estimates for the Niassa Reserve, the
proposed extension and buffer zone indicate that there are between 8000 and 10000
elephants in the area
o  African or Cape Buffalo (Syncerus caffer) are abundant within the Reserve and buffer zone
and occur in herds of up to 500 in the Niassa Reserve. The estimated total population is
6500-8000 animals.
o  Sable Antelope (Hippotragus niger) are widely distributed throughout the Reserve
especially in woodlands surrounding wetlands and open grasslands. The estimated total
population 3750-5000.
o  Greater Kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) are scattered in small groups throughout the area,
although not in large numbers. The estimated total population is 3000-3750.

o Lichtenstein's Hartebeest (Alcelaphus lichtensteinii) with an estimated total population of
900-1250.
o Waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus subsp. kondensis) are confined mainly to the larger river
systems: the Rovuma, Lugenda, Chuilezi, Misangeze and Miuro Rivers. Their nmbers are
limited (estimated total of 600-900) and their status should be considered vulnerable.
At a national level several large mammal species are believed to be extinct or on the verge of
extinction e.g., the black and white rhino, giraffe, roan antelope, tsessebe, the mountain
reedbuck and the African wild dog.
Two rodent species of conservation concern occur. The first is the Selinda veld rat, Aethomys
silindensis, which is only known from the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border area in rock areas at
700-800 m in miombo woodland. The second is a species of woodland mouse, Grammomys
comestes, only known from the coastal forest belt (also in Tanzania and South Africa). The
chequered elephant shrew subspecies Rhynchocyon cireni cireni is known only from
Quelimane, Zambezia Province. Its occurrence and conservation requirements in the coastal
forest belt require investigation.
2.3 BIRDS
Five hundred and eighty-one bird species have been recorded for Mozambique, out of
approximately 900 species recorded southern Africa (Roberts, Birds of Southern Africa 1993).
There are a number of near endemic species, mostly associated with isolated montane
habitats such as the Gorongosa Massif, the Chiperone and Namuli Mountains and the
Njesi plateau. Some rare and restricted range bird species include the following:
o The Namuli apalis (Apalis lynesi) is known to occur only in the woodlands and forests of
Mount Namuli. It is one of the world's most restricted bird species.
o The Dappled-mountain Robin (Modulatrix orostruthus) is a rare and restricted range
species only recorded for Mount Namrnli (Zambezia Province) in Mozambique.
u The Chirinda Apalis (Apalis chirindensis) a restricted range species believed to be endemic
to the Chimanimani/Nyanga Mountains on the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border and
Gorongosa Mountain.

o Swynnerton's Forest Robin (Swynnertonia swynnertoni) has only been recorded for
Chimanimani Mountains (Mozambique-Zimbabwe) and Mount Namuli.
o A separate subspecies of the Whitebreasted Alethe (Alethe fuelleborni) has been recorded
for Gorongosa Mountain and lowland forests near Dondo (Sofala Province). The species is
partly migratory breeding in montane forest and moving to the foothills and coastal forest
in the cold season. The birds recorded at Dondo are probably breeding on Gorongosa
Mountain. The species must be considered rare and very susceptible to habitat destruction.
o In Mozambique the Greenheaded Oriole (Oriolus chorocephalus) is recorded only for
Gorongosa Mountain. This is considered an isolated sub-species characterized by a white
wing patch (0. c. speculifer).
o The Oliveheaded Weaver (Ploceus oliviaceps) is a miombo species found only in a small
patch of coastal miombo in the Inhambane Province. The Inhambane population has been
described as a separate subspecies.
The freshwater and marine wetlands of Mozambique are important sites for migratory and
resident aquatic bird species. One of the most important wetland sites in Mozambique is the
Zambezi Delta. Over fifty species of waterbirds have been recorded for the Delta. The Delta
supports numerous vulnerable and threatened species of global concern, including the Wattled
Crane (Bugeranus carunculatus), Grey Crowned Crane (Balearica regulorum), African
Skimmer (Rynchops flavirostris), White Pelican, Pinkbacked Pelican, Woolynecked Stork
(Ciconia episcopus), Openbilled Stork (Anastomus lamelligerus), Sanddlebilled Stork,
Yellowbellied Stork (Mycteria ibis), Black Stork (Ciconia nigra), Redwinged Pratincole
(Glareola pratincola) and Caspian Tern (Sterna caspia).
The biological importance of the Zambezi Delta is discussed further in Chapter 4 "Areas of
Outstanding Value".
The conservation status of the birds of Mozambique is currently being determined through the
preparation of a Bird Atlas for the entire country (due to be completed by 2005). A
preliminary list of birds on conservation concern is given below:
a    Of Special Concern:
Wattled Crane - Bugeranus carunculatus (Gmelin, 1789)
African skimmer - Rynchopsfavirostris
Martial Eagle - Polemaetus bellicosus
b    Rare:

2.3 REPTILES
One hundred and sixty reptile species have been recorded for Mozambique (including marine
turtles). The conservation status of reptiles, with the exception of sea turtles, is largely
unknown. According to Dutton and Dutton (1974), 60 reptile species (including 34 species of
snake) have been recorded for the Chimanimani Massif of which one is endemic (Platysaurus
ocellatus - the flat rock lizard).
One snake species, the African Rock Python (Python sebae natalensis A. Smith) is believed to
endangered and is protected by law. Threats include collecting for food, skin, medicinal
purposes, the pet trade, and destruction due to its perceived danger to man and livestock.
Habitat destruction may cause local extinction. Crocodiles are becoming threatened due to
hunting for their skins.
All five species of Indian Ocean sea turtles nest on beaches along the Mozambique coast: the
Loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), the Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), the Green Turtle
(Chelonia mydas), the Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) and the Olive Ridley turtle
(Lepidochelys olivacea). All species are protected in Mozambique.
The Loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and Leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) nest along
the coast from Ponta do Ouro to Bazaruto Archipelago. The most important areas are Ponta do
Ouro - Machangulo Peninsula coastline (including the Maputo Elephant Reserve), Inhaca
Island, Qewene Peninsula and Bazaruto Archipelago (Hughes, 1971a). The peak nesting
season is between November and January (Hughes, 1971b; Costa, 1989; Gove and Magane,
1995).

The Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas) nests from Qewene Peninsula to Quirimbas Archipelago.
The biggest concentration appears to be in the Primeiras e Segundas Islands (Hughes, 1971).
Nests of this species were found recently on the Bazaruto Archipelago (Gove and Magane,
1996).
The Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) and Olive Ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea)
occur on the northern coast (Hughes, 1971 b) but their nesting areas are unknown.
2.4 AMPHIBIA
Amphibians are important "biological indicators" of environmental stress in wetlands.
The amphibia of Mozambique are not well documented. The exact number of species of
amphibia in Mozambique is unclear, due to taxonomic uncertainty. The Natural History
Museum has records of only 39 species.
Thirty-five amphibian species were recorded for the Chimanimani Massif of which two are
endemic: Bufo vertebralis grindleyi (Grindleys toad) and Anthroleptis troglodytes (the cave
squeaker).
The conservation status of the amphibia in Mozambique is unknown.
2.5 RIVERINE FISH FAUNA
Only the fish species in the major river systems such as the Zambezi, Limpopo, Pungue and
Nkomati rivers have been documented (Werger, 1978). The lower Zambezi has by far the
greatest fish biodiversity. The conservation status of fish species in Mozambique is not known.
Riverine fish species include in the lower Zambezi River include: Tilapia rendalli (Cichlidae);
Clarias gariepinus, Heterobranchus longifilis (Clariidae); Limnothrissa miodion (Clupeidae);
Barbua fasciolatus, B. lineomaculatus, B. marequensis, B. unitaeniatus, Labeo altivelis, L.
congero, L. cylindricus, L. molybdinus (Cyprinidae); Aplocheilichthys johnstoni, A. kattangae
(Cyprinodontidae); Distichodus mossambicus, D. schenga (Distichodontidae); Malapteruru
electricus (Malapteruridae); Eutropius depressirostris (Mochokiadae); and Synodontis
nebulosus, S. zambezensis (Schilbeidae). Species of Glossogobius, Marcusenius and
Mormyrops are also important in all the rivers.
In 1968 the Lake Tanganyika sardine (or kapenta) Limnothrissia miodon was introduced into
Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe. Kapenta is now thriving in Lake Cahora Bassa apparently by
invasive spread from Lake Kariba.
A list of fish species in the Lower Zambezi, Limpopo and Pungue Rivers is given in
Appendix 1.

3 PROTECTED AREAS
3.1 GAZETTED PROTECTED AREAS
Existing National Parks and Reserves in Mozambique were established prior to Independence
under Decree N 40040, 20 January 1955. There are six categories of protected area. Parques
Nacionais (national parks), Reservas Especiais (game reserves), Reservas Parciais (partial
reserves), Regimes de Vigilancia (vigilance areas), Coutadas (areas set aside for hunting and
photographic safari) and Reservas Florestais (forest reserves). The Direccao Nacional de
Florestas e Fauna Bravia (DNFFB) - Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is
responsible for their administration currently.  The DNFFB is also responsible for the
management and conservation wildlife and forestry resources outside of the protected areas
network. The Government of Mozambique has decided to transfer responsibility of the
National Parks and Reserves to the newly created Ministry of Tourism. It is envisaged that the
transfer will be concluded in the first quarter of 2001.
National Parks and Game Reserves are managed for ecological, cultural and/or aesthetic
objectives. Hunting activities under Licence are permitted in the Coutadas (Controlled Hunting
Areas). The exploitation of forest resources in the Forest Reserves is strictly controlled.
The numbers (in parentheses) of protected areas per category are: National Parks (4), Game
Reserves (5), Controlled Hunting Areas or Coutadas (13), Vigilance Areas (2) and Forest
Reserves (16). The list of protected areas and their size is presented in Table 4. Their
distribution shown in shown in Figure 5.
A new Forestry and Wildlife Law has recently been approved by the Council of Ministers and
the Parliament (1999). The new Law recognizes three categories of protected zones for the
conservation of biodiversity and fragile ecosystems: National Parks; National Reserves; and
Historical - Cultural Use Zones.

National Parks are total protection zones for the protection, conservation and management of
vegetation and wildlife as well as the protection of sites of special scientific, cultural or
aesthetic interest and for recreation that are representative of the national heritage. Hunting,
forestry, agriculture, mining, prospecting, digging and land-filling are prohibited.
National Reserves are designated for the protection of rare species of fauna and flora,
endemics, species threatened with extinction or in decline, sensitive ecosystems such as
wetlands, dunes, mangroves and corals as well as the conservation of flora and fauna within
these ecosystems. Activities that are prohibited in national parks are also prohibited in national
reserves although certain resources may be exploited upon issuance of a license.
The recognition of Historical-Cultural Use Zones is a completely new category for
Mozambique reflecting the new policies to ensure that local communities are involved in
natural resource management. These Use Zones are areas for protection of forests of religious
importance or cultural use in accordance with the customary norms and practices of the
respective communities. The forestry and wildlife resources within the zones may be used in
accordance with customary norms and practices.
It is planned to reclassify the existing protected areas gazetted under colonial times in
accordance with the new Law. The existing national parks and reserves will probably maintain
the same category of classification. No Historical-Cultural Use Zones have been declared
although the first protected area of this category has been proposed for the Chimanimani area
(Sussundenga District, Manica Province) under the Transfrontier Conservation Areas Project
(see below).
3.2 TRANSFRONTIER CONSERVATION AREAS (TFCAs)
In 1996 the Government of Mozambique approved the implementation of a Transfrontier
Conservation Areas (TFCA) Project funded by the Global Environmental Facility. Importantly,
the new concept of Conservation Areas (rather than National Parks) places greater emphasis on
multiple resource use and management by local communities living in/adjacent to these areas.
A TFCA is considered to be a relatively large region of mostly communal land incorporating
one or more recognised biodiversity conservation or utilisation centres (e.g. National Park,
Reserve, Coutada etc.), the whole to be developed in an integrated fashion for the economic
benefit of indigenous communities without loss of biodiversity. The TFCA's are contiguous
with protected areas in a South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Location of TFCAs
Three TFCAs, based an biodiversity, social and economic criteria, are currently being
developed:
The Lubombos TFCA, southern Mozambique, Maputo Province - contiguous with the
Tembe and Ndumo Reserves in South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal)
This area lies in the south-eastern part of Maputo Province, in the extreme south-east of
Mozambique. It includes the Maputo Game Reserve (700 kM2) and the proposed Futi corridor
(an area of undisturbed habitat and relatively low population density), which would link the
Maputo Reserve with the Tembe Elephant Park and the Ndumo Game Reserve in Kwazulu,
South Africa. In the past elephants and other wildlife ranged across these areas. The project
area forms part of the Maputaland Centre for Plant Diversity which ranks as a first order site of
global botanical significance. Habitats in the TFCA are pristine and the high area has a
potential for conservation and ecotourism-based development.

Gazaland TFCA south-west Mozambique, Gaza and Inhambane Provinces - contiguous
with Kruger National Park in South Africa and Ghono-Re-Zhou National Park in
Zimbabwe
The Gaza TFCA covers 20,700 km2. of protected area in the districts of Mabalane, Chigubo,
Chicualacuala, and Massegene in the Province of Gaza, and the district of Mabote in Province
of Inhambane. Gaza Province borders on Zimbabwe in the north-west and South Africa in the
south-west. This is an important TFCA as it includes three main conservation areas: Zinave
(3,700 kM2) and Banhine National Parks (7,000 kM2) and Coutada 16 (a 10,000 km 2 wildlife
utilisation area); the latter is contiguous with the Kruger National Park in South Africa. The
Gaza TFCA also borders on the Gono-Rhe-Zhou National Park in Zimbabwe.
The Gaza TFCA forms a corridor between the rapidly developing wildlife and tourism
industries in south-east Zimbabwe and the more slowly developing, but potentially lucrative
tourism industry along the Inhambane coast and Bazaruto Archipelago.
In November 2000, the Government of Mozambique signed an agreement with the
Governments of South Africa and Zimbabwe to incorporate Coutada 16 into an expanded
transfrontier national park to be named the Gaza-Kruger-Gono-Rhe-Zou (GKG) Transfrontier
National Park. Due to its proximity to conservation areas in South Africa and Zimbabwe, the
potential for artificial and natural restocking is high.
Chimanimani TFCA, west, central Mozambique, Manica Province contiguous with the
Chimanimani National Park in Zimbabwe.
The Chimanimami TFCA is contiguous with the Chimanimani National Park in Zimbabwe,
this TFCA in Manica Province is a relatively small area of 1,740 kM2, and includes the eastern
escarpment and foothills of the Chimanimani massif. The area in Mozambique is better
preserved, and represents a relatively intact Afro-montane ecosystem, with high species
endemism (notably plants), and rich wildlife and bird populations (see Chapter 4 below)

4 AREAS OF OUTSTANDING VALUE
Eight areas of outstanding ecosystem, biological and/or scenic value which warrant special
attention in Mozambique have been identified. These are shown on Figure 7 and described in
the following.
4.1 GORONGOSA MOUNTAIN- RIFT VALLEY COMPLEX.
This area encompasses the isolated massif of Gorongosa Mountain which rises to 1 863m and
the southern-most, Mozambican sector, of the African Rift Valley (known as the Urema
Trough). The trough lies 15m above sea level at a distance of 120km from the coast
Gorongosa Mountain is an isolated montane block 160km inland from the sea. Orographic
rainfall (where moist air rises, condenses and falls as rain) provides the mountain with an
annual rainfall of over 2000mm per year. The mountain supports tropical to montane rainforest
on its summits with heath grasslands.
Endemic and near-endemic plants and animals occur within the mountain's habitats. Examples
include the Greenheaded Oriole (Oriolus chlorocephalus) sub-species O.c. speculifer,
characterised by a white wing patch is found on Gorongosa Mountain, the Dappled-mountain
Robin (Modulatrix orostruthus), the Chirinda Apalis (Apalis chirindensis) a restricted range
species, Swynnerton's Forest Robin (Swynnertonia swynnertoni) and separate subspecies of the
Whitebreasted Alethe (Alethefuelleborni).
The Rift Valley is a floodplain ecosystem reliant on both the amount and distribution of rain in the
Urema catchment. The Gorongosa Mountain is the most important perennial source of water for
the floodplains in the Valley. The central position of the Urema Lake in the floor of the Rift
Valley makes it a recipient of primary importance to which the flooding processes are eventually
related. The changes in inputs into the Lake are clearly displayed by the extension and
contraction of the lake waters across the surrounding plains. During maximal flooding the Urema
Lake expands from a dry season minimum of 10 km2 to about 200 km2 area.
A variety of wetlands habitats occur in the Rift Valley including rivers, lakes, temporary pans,
reed swamps, floodplain grassland and palm savanna. The diversity of habitats in the Rift Valley
makes it one of the finest wildlife grazing ecosystems in Africa as reflected by the spectacular
wildlife that inhabited the Valley prior to the armed conlfict. The southern portion of the Rift
Valley is protected within the Gorongosa National Park
Tinley (1977) lists 46 large mammal species (of size greater than5 kg mass) for the Gorongosa
area. Several of these species are believed to be near extinction or extinct e.g., tsessebe, the roan
antelope and the black and white rhino.
The Gorongosa-Rift Valley Complex is diverse in terms of ecosystems, plant formations,
habitat types, unique assemblages of big game population and rare or confined (endemic)
plants and animals. The outstanding value of this area thus encompasses:
o high scenic values;
o large geological diversity;

4.2 THE CHERINGOMA PLATEAU
The Cheringoma Plateau (300m above sea level) on Cretaceous sediments comprises tropical
forests containing a mixture of local endemics with equatorial, north-east coast and southern
African flora.
The forest on the Plateau contain several commercially important hardwood species such as
Milletia stuhlmani (panga-panga), Afzelia quanzensis (chanfuta) and Pterocarpus angolensis
(umbila). Current access to these forests is via the Dondo-Caia road which is in poor condition.
Access to these forests will be increased when the Gorongosa-Caia road is completed.
4.3 ZAMBEZI DELTA GRASSLANDS AND SWAMPS.
The Zambezi Delta covers an area of about 18,000 ki2, from its apex at Chupanga to its 120
km front with the Indian Ocean coast extending from Quelimane south-west to Machesse.
Marromeu Buffalo Reserve is located on the southern portion of the Delta (Figure 8). In
addition to buffalo, elephants, water buck and reedbuck occur in the Delta although their
numbers have been much reduced by hunting.

The Zambeze Delta represents an important wetland for resident and migratory bird species.
The Wattled Crane (Bugeranus carunculatus) and the saddle-billed stork, (Ephippiorhynchus
senegalensis), both of special concern, occur in the Zambeze Delta.
The Zambezi Delta also supports numerous vulnerable and threatened species of global
concern, including the Wattled Crane, Grey Crowned Crane, African Skimmer (Rynchops

(Mycteria ibis), Black Stork (Ciconia nigra), Redwinged Pratincole (Glareola pratincola) and
Caspian Tern (Sterna caspia). The delta supports colonies of thousands of pairs of White
Pelicans among the coastal mangroves in southeastern Marromeu Complex, one of the largest
breeding colonies recorded in Southern Africa.
Three immense breeding colonies of storks and herons have also been recorded in the
Marromeu floodplains (Beilfuss and Bento, 1997). The largest colony supports hundreds of
pairs of Openbilled Stork, Yellowbellied Stork, Sacred Ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus), African
Spoonbill (Platalea alba) and three species of egrets (Egretta spp). Large breeding colonies of
Reed Cormorant (Phalacrocorax africanus), Squacco Heron (Ardeola ralloides), Grey Heron
(Ardea cinerea) and Blackheaded Heron (Ardea melanocephala) were also noted. Large
groups of migrant Abdim's Storks (Ciconia abdimii) utilize the delta grasslands in the summer.
Wetland scientists believe that the Zambezi Delta qualifies as a Wetland of International
Importance under the Ramsar Convention, and is of great socio-economic and cultural value to
Mozambique.

4.4 THE GREAT INSELBERG ARCHIPELAGO
The lnselberg archipelago presents a truly remarkable landscape of tall granite core remnants
in a savanna plain.

This series of habitats occurs south of the Lurio River occupying a rectangular area of
approximately 500km  by 160km  wide lying in a south-west to north-east direction
(approximately between 140 to 17S; 3540'E to 380 E thence NE-wards to 3940'E).
The Inselberg Region has high scenic value as well as high biological value. The latter is
characterised by unique flora and fauna (endemics and biogeographical outliers) contained in
the isolated rainforest, patches of which form aprons around the flanks and base of the
inselbergs. Many of the areas are unknown biologically and it is highly likely undescribed
species remain to be discovered. Like Gorongosa Mountain these inselbergs are high enough to -
result in a large continuous belt of high rainfall, an orographic perennial aquifer.
Mount Namuli is an isolated mountain peak rising out of a plateau at 800m to a height of just
over 2400m. It is the highest mountain in northern Mozambique. The slopes of the peaks
support a mix of moist montane forests and grassy meadows. The forests are characterised by
high levels of endemism. The Namuli apalis (Apalis lynesi) is one of the world's most
restricted bird species and is known to occur only in the woodlands and forests of Mount
Namuli. The Namrnli forests are also home to a further five globally threatened bird species and
14 biome restricted species. Other globally threatened species include the Thyolo Alethe
(Alethe choloensis), the Dapplethroat (Modutlatrix orostruthus) and the Oliveheaded weaver
(Ploceus olivaceiceps). The forests of Mount Namuli include an endemic small mammal (the
white bellied red squirrel).

4.5 CHIMANIMANI MASSIF MOZAMBIQUE-ZIMBABWE
FRONTIER ESCARPMENT REGION
The Chimanimani Massif forms part of the great eastern escarpment of the Interior Continental
Plateau of South Central Africa, along the Mozambique-Zimbabwe frontier.
The escarpment mountain range is separated into a series of massifs by the water gaps which
have cut saddles in the escarpment. The Chimanimani Massif rises to 2436m at Binga Peak,
the highest point in Mozambique. As a physiographic unit it is demarcated to the north, south
and east by the natural boundaries formed by two major perennial tributaries of the Buzi River
which flows east to enter the Indian Ocean in the Bight of Sofala only 150km distant.
The whole massif area is some 40km from north to south and 20km wide, contained within
coordinates 19024' to 2005', and between 32050' and 33025', standing mostly above the 800m
contour. The Chimanimani Massif although relatively small in area is characterised by an
exceptionally high diversity of habitats and species.
The massif is composed of strongly contorted and folded quartzites and schists. Rugged
outcrops and crags are formed by the quartzites and smooth rounded or planar surfaces by the
schists.
The scenery is stepped with a series of spectacular steep rocky scarps and ravines separated by
flattened undulating terrain, with high waterfalls plunging off each step.
Leached, acid, sandy soils develop on the quartzites which support ericaceous heaths and
restios, upland miombo woodland with dense montane evergreen forest in ravines. The
quartzites support a rich endemic flora of some 50 known species. The red clayey soils
derived from schists are seasonally waterlogged and these support open (treeless) montane
grasslands. The endemic animals are two frogs and one reptile.
There are well preserved Rock Paintings throughout the area depicting all the local and
lowland big game of the region.
Dry montane forests are found in valleys and on gentle slopes at higher altitude (1000-1600m).
Commonly occurring tree species include Iex mitis, Macaranga capensis and Myrica
pilulifera. The coniferous species Podocarpus milanjianus and Widdringtonia nodiflora
represent the more xeric elements of these forests. Along river courses the tree fern, Cyathea,
is common.
On well-drained and shallow quartzite soils sclerophyllous thickets occur. They vary greatly in
floristic composition but some members of the Ericaceae (eg. Erica and Phillipia) and
Proteaceae (eg. Protea and Faurea) are nearly always present. Several species belonging to
these families are endemic to the Massif.
58602 Annexure C                   December2000                               35

On shallow rocky soils Aloe and Euphorbia species commonly occur. The endemic Vellozia
argentea grows on almost bare rock and is able to withstand long periods desiccation. These
communities may occur up to 2000m.
Nearly 1000 vascular plant species have been recorded for the area of which 45 are endemic
(Dutton and Dutton, 1975). No less than five Aloe species are endemic in the Chimanimani
mountains (A. munchii, A. hazeliana, A. howmanii, A. plawsii and A. wildii) hilst three species
of Erica (E. lanceolifera, E. pleiotricha and E. wildii) and two species of Protea (P. crinita and
P. enervis) are considered endemic.
Large mammals are well represented on the Mozambican side of the Chimanimani Massif
although poaching by dogs and snares is common. According to Dutton & Dutton (1975)
commonly occurring species include buffalo (Syncerus caffer), bushbuck (Tragelaphus
scriptus), eland (Taurotragus oryx), sable (Hippotragus niger), Klipspringer (Oreotragus
oreotragus), common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia) and blue duiker (Philantomba monticola).
Reed-buck (Redunca arundinum) occur on the alluvial floodplains and along river courses east
of the Massif. Reports of a small population mountain reed buck (Redunca fulvorufula)
inhabiting the Chimanimani Mountains have not been confirmed.
Over 160 bird species have been recorded for the Chimanimani (Dutton & Dutton, 1975) some
of which are considered endemic to the Afro-montane regions of eastem Africa. Swynnerton's
Robin (Swynnertonia swynnertonia) inhabits the moister elements of the montane forests
(Collar & Stuart, 1985) highlighting of the faunal connections that exist with other dysjunct
montane areas (eg. the Eastem Arc Mountains of Tanzania). Other rare avifaunal species
occurring in the moist forests of the Chimanimani Massif include Circaetis fasciolatus
(Southern Banded Snake Eagle), Cercococcyx montanus (Barred Cuckoo), Andropadus
importunis (Sombre Bulbul), Prinonops scopifrens (Chestnutfronted Helmetshrike) and Batis
fratum (Woodwards' Batis).
Thirty-five amphibian species, of which two are endemic (Bufo vertebralis grindleyi and
Anthroleptis troglodytes) and sixty reptile species (including 34 species of snake) have been
recorded for the Massif. Crocodiles are reported to occur in all major river systems at lower
altitudes.
The outstanding universal values of the Chimanimani Massif are:
u Spectacular mountain and waterfall wilderness scenery, with big game;
o  High plant endemism;
o  High plant community diversity from montane heaths and grasslands down to lowland
tropical rainforest in the gorges and valley bottoms;
o  Well preserved San Rock Art.
4.6 THE MAPUTALAND CENTRE OF ENDEMISM (MC)
The MC (26,734 krn2) is defined as that part of southem Mo,ambique and north-eastern Natal
bounded in the north by the Inkomati-Limpopo River, in the west by the western foothills of
the Libombos, in the south by the St. Lucia estuary and in the east by the Indian Ocean.
58602 Annexure C                   December2000                               36

IMPACTOLda                                                               WSMEC
The area is characterised by a flat low-level coastal plain with a maximum elevation of 150 m.
The eastern shoreline is characterised by a parabolic dune system rising to almost 200 m.a.s.l.
in certain places, considered to be the tallest vegetated dunes in the world.
The MC contains extensive wetland notably Lake St. Lucia (c. 350 kin2), Lake Sibaya (65
kM2) and the Kosi Lake System in South Africa and Lakes Piti, Xingute and Satine in Southern
Mozambique.
The MC flora is very distinct comprising to 2000 to 3000 species (van Wyk, 1994). Of these,
at least 168 species/infraspecific taxa (this is probably an underestimate) and 4 genera
(Brachychloa, Ephippiocarpa, Helichrysopsis, Inhambanella) are endemic/near-endemic to the
centre. Several of the endemics are rare and known only from a few collections. The MC
clearly has floristic links with the more tropical parts of Africa to the north. The centre is at the
southern end of the tropics in Africa and many tropical species reach the southern most limits
of their ranges in this area.
The associated fauna of the MPR, and particularly of the MC, is interesting and rich. Of the
more than 472 species of birds in the MC (57% of South Africa's total), 47 subspecies are
endemic/near-endemic to the centre. The MC corresponds with the southern part of the South-
east African coast Endemic Bird Area (EBA). This has three endemic restricted-range birds
species, which occur in a wide-range of habitat types (van Wyk, 1994).
As with its flora, the MC is the southernmost part of the range of many components of the East
African fauna. The centre is of exceptional biogeographical interest because of the sharp
biogeographic transformation in the region. Other endemic/near-endemic species and
infraspecific taxa (total indigenous to the centre in brackets) include 14 mammals (102 species,
about 4 locally extinct) 23 reptiles (about 112 species/subspecies), 3 frogs (45
species/subspecies) and 7 freshwater fishes (67 species); (van Wyk, 1994).
4.7 COASTAL BARRIER LAKES
A characteristic feature of the Ponta do Ouro - Bazaruto stretch of coast are the extensive
coastal lakes, swamps and temporary rain-filled pans which occur behind the parabolic dune
systems. The most important coastal lakes from north to south are: Lagos Dongane, Poelela
(9250 ha), Maiene, Quissico (3250 ha), Nhamabvale, Nhamzume, Uembje (Bilene) (3200 ha),
Muandje (2250 ha), Pati (1850 ha), Piti (2.700 ha), Xingute (1150 ha), Satine (500 ha) - see
Figure 11. These lakes are located on a plain of low elevation and most are separated from the
sea by a well developed longshore dune system.
The coastal lakes provide habitat for many bird species including Ciconia episcopus (White
Stork), Egretta garzeta (Little Egret) and Phoenicopterus ruber (pink flamingos) which occur
in the lakes of the Maputo Reserve.
Besides their importance biologically these coastal systems have high scenic value. A proposal
has been developed to declare the Maputaland wetlands (between Ponta do Ouro and Inhaca
island) a Natural World Heritage Site. This will be submitted to the Mozambican Government
for consideration. The South African component (St. Lucia Estuary/Kosi Bay) of this unique
wetland system has been declared a RAMSAR Wetland.

4.8 PEBANE EVERGREEN COASTAL FORESTS
Evergreen Coastal Forests in northern coastal Zambezia Province have been encroached upon
by slash and burn agriculture. Recent surveys (Branch, 1998) have high-lighted the biological
importance of these forests. Remarkably a new (and possibly endemic) tree species was
discovered in these forests during an EIA carried out in 1998.
A rich and diverse reptile fauna occurs in the coastal forests of Pebane. Sixty (60) species of
reptiles have been recorded: 21 lizards, I amphisbaenid, 31 snakes, 6 chelonians and a

crocodile. It is estimated that an additional 20 terrestrial species, mainly snakes, may still be
discovered in this region. In a recent survey two new reptile species were discovered; a new
snake (Dromophis sp.) and a new dwarf day gecko (Lygodactylus sp.). The snake was collected
in Coastal Forest. The new gecko was also collected from forested habitats. Both reptile
species at present are considered endemic to the area.
The Zambeze soft-shelled terrapin (Cyciodermafrenatum) listed as "Near Threatened" in the
South African Red List was recorded for Moebase and represents an important range extension
for this species into the coastal drainage systems of northern Mozambique.  -
Coastal forest bird specialists occurring in these habitats include the Crested Guineafowl,
Green Coucal, Yellowspotted Nicator, Chestnutfronted Helmet Shrike, Yellow-Bellied
Sunbird, Silvery-cheeked Hombill, Whitefronted Plover, Redwinged Pratincole, Black Coucal,
Cinnamon-breasted Tit, Woodward's batis and Livingstone's Flycatcher.

I TOPOGRAPHY
The major topographic features of Mozambique are shown in Figure 1. The country has three
broad topographic regions and these are descried below.
The northern part of Mozambique is a great mountainous block with maximum elevations
along the eastem edge of the East African Rift Valley system (border with Malawi). Here the
summits of Mt. Jeci (1250'S/3509'E) and Mt. Chiperone (16'30'S/35044'E) reach 1836 and
2054 m asl respectively, and more centrally Mt. Namrnli (15025'S/37000'E) reaches 2419 m.
From these westem heights the land slopes gently eastwards and south-eastwards towards the
Indian Ocean with many extensive plateaux. Drainage is by 18 perennial rivers and many small
streams (Hughes and Hughes, 1992).
The central region is dominated by the lower Zambezi Valley and its delta plains. In the
interior, in Tete Province, the rims of the Valley are mountainous, reaching elevations of
2095m at Mt. Domue (1428'S/3415'E) on the border with Malawi. In this part of the basin
drainage is into either the Lake Cahora Bassa, or the Zambezi below it, by numerous fast
flowing seasonal streams. These streams rise in Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe. The Shire
River, draining Lake Malawi, enters the Zambezi in the lowlands.
The southern part of the country, south of Beira (1949'S/3452'E), comprises a broad coastal
plain backed by mountains along the western national border. The land is generally below
00m asl in the south, except along border with Zimbabwe and South Africa, and more than
85% of the land surface is below the 200m contour. Along the western border with Zimbabwe,
the land rises up sharply to reach the southern Africa plateau, the largest plateau in the world.
This north-south mountain range in this area known as the Chimanimani Mountains (Manica
Province), forms part of the Great Escarpment. The highest elevation is attained at Mt. Binga
(2436m), a montane area reaching out from Zimbabwe (19'47'S/33'03'E). A number of
important watercourses drain the highlands along the western border, including, from N-S, the
Pangue, Revue, Buzi, Gorongosa, Save, Limpopo, Incomati, Umbeluzi and Maputo Rivers.
Not all streams are perennial. Most are reduced to a series of isolated pools by the end of the
dry season, especially since impoundments have been made in their upper reaches. Most of the
rivers rise in other countries, and many are dammed before they reach Mozambique, e.g., the
Save, Limpopo, Incomati, and Maputo Rivers.

2 GEOLOGY
2.1  BACKGROUND
Central-southern Africa experienced successive uplifts between the late Mesozoic (100 million
years BP) and Tertiary times (65 million years BP) forming the Great African Plateau which is
the largest plateau in the world. The highest parts of the southern African plateau occur on the
Eastem Escarpment which coincides, in places, with the western border of Mozambique with
Zimbabwe e.g., the Chimanimani and Inyanga mountains.
The original edge of the plateau is thought to have formed the coastal margin of the continent
at one time. As the sea floor became exposed during uplifts the edge of the plateau receded
from the coast. Of outstanding importance, with regards central and southern Mozambique, is
the low-lying landscape that slopes gently towards the Indian Ocean. In contrast to other
coastal countries in the sub-continent, Mozambique has extensive coastal lowlands and most of
the area south of Beira is characterized by a broad coastal plain.
A striking feature of East Africa is the Rift Valley System. The western Rift passes through
Lakes Tanganyka and Niassa (the latter is also known as Lake Malawi) and penetrates
Mozambique in a north-south direction via the Shire River valley which drains Lake Malawi.
The Rift Valley crosses the present course of the Zambeze River slightly upstream from Caia
where it branches and runs in a SW direction to form the Buzi Trough and SE to disappear in
the area between Beira and the old Arab port of Sofala. The southern-most Mozambican sector
of the Rift is known as the Urema Trough. This is enclosed on either side by higher plateau
country. On the western margin the Urema Trough is surmnounted by the isolated block of
Gorongosa Mountain and the eastern margin by the Cheringoma Plateau. Gorongosa Mountain
is 160 km inland from the sea, and the centre of the Rift Valley within the same transect is 120
km. The nearest large highland massifs to Gorongosa are the Mozambique-Zimbabwean
Escarpment, 100 km inland to the west (the Chimanimani Mountains) and the isolated
Morrumbala Mountain 150 km to the north-east near the confluence of the Shire with Zambeze
River. A remnant of the former coastal plain was left as an isolated elevated block which forms
the eastern side of the Urema Trough, known as the Cheringoma Plateau.
Quaternary climatic fluctuations and associated sea level rises and falls further influenced the
soils and drainage systems and their associated vegetation. Large areas of south-eastern
Mozamb;que are characterised by interior sandy plains and interior dunes of marine and
aeolion origin.
Geomorphological features of Mozambique are shown in Figure 2.

The main geological formations are shown in Figure 3. They ares
i   Pre-Cambrian (> 550 millon to 2000 million BP)
Geological formations of the Pre-Cambian comprise rocks rnore than 600 million years old and
cover almost the entire northern and central, western areas of the Mozambique (Niassa, Cabo
Delgado, Zambezi, Tete Provinces and parts of Nampula and Manica Provinces).
The oldest rocks are granitic more than 2000 million years old of the Zimbabwe Craton within
the "Manica System" along the Zimbabwe. Also associated with the Manica System are
quartzites and schists rocks older than 1600 million years BP.
Slightly younger is the metamorphic crystalline Pre-Cambrian basement occurring in north-
central western Mozambique comprising granitic and migmatic gneisses. These metamorphic
rocks belong to the Barue Formation. In the Provinces of Niassa, Nampula and Tete and, to a
lesser extent, Cabo Delagdo towering outcrops of granite rock (known as inselbergs), some
reaching elevations of more than 1000 m, rise sharply above the plains. Around these granitic
intrusions occur pegmatites, mainly comprising quartz and feldspar but some with rare
industrial minerals.
In central Tete Province ultrabasic rocks form the so-called "Tete Complex" comprising
amphibolites, gabbro and pyroxinite.
ii   Karroo System (350 - 130 million BP, overlaps with the Jurassic and Cretaceous
periods)
In Mozambique the Karroo is represented by sedimentary and volcanic rocks about 350 - 130
million years old.
The Stromberg series comprises sandstone, basalt and rhyolites. This formation is found at the
junction of the crystalline basement with the Cretaceous sediments along the major tectonic
line of the Zambeze River Valley and Lower Zambeze trough running north-east between
Espungabera and the Zambeze River (mainly basalts) and again along the Libombo Mountain
range forming border with South Africa and Swaziland ( rhyolites and basalts).
Coal deposits occur in the Ecca series in the area of Moatize, Tete Province.
iii   Jurassic to Cretaceous (about 208 million to 65 million BP)
The uper Lupata sandstone are post-Karroo red sandstones and mudstones cemented by
argilaceous and tufaceous material running approximately northwards from Gorongosa
Mountain to Lupata in association with the Maringue karroo sedimants Red sandy clays and
clays are produced from the weathered products with a calcium rich sub-soil.

The oldest Cretaceous sediments are continental in origin. Marine cretaceous sediments,
known as the Grudja (running north-east over the Buzi River immediately to the west of the
sandy plains), overly the continental Cretaceous sediments and are characterised by the
presence of fossil shells. The marine cretaceous formations are the source of hydrocarbon
minerals.
iv    Tertiary (65 million - 1.8 million BP)
Early Tertiary formations occur north east of Magude, the Cheringoma Plateau (the
Cheringoma. Formation, age 54 million years) and in smaller areas of Cabo Delgado Province.
Late Tertiary formations (7-26 million years) may overly the Early Tertiary formations e.g. the
Mazamba Formation in Sofala Province.
v    Quaternary to Recent (age 1.8 million years BP to Recent)
Quatemary to Recent Formations, mainly non-sedimentary sands and alluviums occurs
throughout much of southem Mozambique south of Beira. It includes the entire area south of
the Save River except for the Libombo rhyolites and basalts and consists almost entirely of
marine quatemary deposits.

2.3 SEISMIC ACTIVITY
The Rift Valley is a geological fault still undergoing tectonic movement causing seismic events
that mainly affect central western Mozambique. Over 52 years, 24 seismic events (<4 on the
Richter Scale) and 4 seismic events (>4 on the Richter scale) occurred in this sub-region
(Figure 4). A combination of deforestation, high rainfall and seismic events probably caused
the Mt Tumbine landslide disaster in Milange District, Zambezia Province in 1997 with the
loss of more than 100 people.

3 SOILS
3.1 DESCRIPTION
The major soil types of Mozambique are shown in Figure 5.
The soils in the northern and some parts of the central and western areas are light clays and
clay loams of medium fertility.
Heavy-textured black soils occur along the northern sector of the coast (Cabo Delgado
Province) and to the east of Espungabera (Manica and Sofala Provinces).
Red sandy soils of low fertility occur in Sofala Province north of Beira (Cheringoma Plateau)
and between Inhambane and Vilankulos.
Alluvial soils occur in the Umbeluzi, Maputo, Incomati, Limpopo and Zambeze river basins.
Though prone to salinization, particularly in delta areas, these soils have a high potential for
agriculture.
Sandy soils of marine and aeolion origin, very low fertility, cover a large portions of southern
Mozambique. Smaller areas of light sandy soils occur in middle Zambezia, Nampula and
Cabo Delgado Provinces.

3.2 POTENTIAL FOR SOIL EROSION
The potential for soil erosion is low to moderate for most of low and mid altitude
Mozambique. There is a high potential for soil erosion in high altitude areas (e.g., The
Lichingo plateau, Niassa Province, and the foothills of the Chimanimani Mountains, Manica
Province) and the mid-Zambezi Valley. Along the Libombos mountains (westem frontier with
South Africa) the potential for soil erosion is considered to be extreme. Soil erosion potential
for Mozambique is shown in Figure 6.

4 CLIMATE
For most of the year the weather is dominated by the high pressure system which prevails over
the southern African Plateau. North-east and south-east air streams from the Indian Ocean
bring rain during the months of October-March. Despite its proximity to the sea, and the warm
southward flowing Mozambique Current, much of the interior of the country is relatively dry.
Rainfall is erratic and unreliable, with high inter-annual variation, especially in southern and
central districts.
Rainfall is highest on the coast. It decreases rapidly on passing inland, but increases again on
the slopes of the mountains along the western borders.
Mean annual rainfall is 750 mm at Maputo (25058'S/32035'E), but only 550 mm at Massingir
(2305 I'S/3158'E), while over much of the southern interior between the Save and Limpopo
Rivers it is below 400 mm.
The entire coastline receives 800-900 mm of rain a year, with four more humid pockets on
SW-NE stretches of coast, where the SE Trade Winds blow perpendicular to the coast in
summer. Elsewhere the prevailing winds are oblique to the coast. The humid pockets are
situated to the east of Xai-Xai (2503'S/33048'E), between the Tropic of Capricorn and
Vilanculos (2201'S/3519'E), from Beira (1949'S/3452'E) to the southern part of the
Zambezi Delta, and from the vicinity of Quelimane (1753'S/3651'E) to Pebane
(1714'S/3810'E). In the first two areas mean annual rainfall is 1000-1200 mm, while in the
second two it is 1200-1400 mm.
The north of the country is generally more humid than the south except for part of the lower
Zambezi Valley in Tete Province, which receives less than 600 mmlyr. There are a series of
very humid pockets along the western border on the upper slopes of the mountains between
Mt. Binga and Mt. Inyangani (18 18'S/3254'E in Zimbabwe). Between 1500-2000 mm of rain
falls in these places in the wet season (mid-November to March) and the Pungue, Revue,
Lucite and Buzi Rivers rise there, or close by in Zimbabwe. The upper courses of these streams
are rocky, and full of cascades and cataracts. Rainfall also exceeds 1500 mm/yr on the isolated
Gorongosa Massif (1830'S/3403'E), standing midway between the western highlands and
Beira on the coast. All the higher mountainous areas north of the Zambezi are wet. Mean
annual precipitation exceeds 2200 mm over a substantial area around the summit of Mt.
Namuli, and a surrounding area of 36,000 km2 receives between 1200-1800 mm/yr. In this
region the Lurio, Meluli, Ligonha, Mol6cue, M'lela, Licungo (Lugela) and Luala Rivers have
their sources.
Mean annual rainfall isohyets for Mozambique are shown in Figure 7. There is a close
relationship between broad "ecozones" and precipitation. Areas receiving more than
2000mm/yr are characterised by rain forest - with decreasing rainfall there is a gradation moist
savanna to arid savanna (Figure 6).
January is the hottest month and July the coldest month. Mean annual temperatures along the
coast increase gradually from south to north: Maputo (22.2C), Xai Xai (22.8C), Inhambane
(23. 1C), Nova Sofala (24.9C), Beira (25C), Quelimane (25.1C) and Pemba (25.5C). Very hot
temperatures exceeding 38C can occur in summer

Mean annual temperatures decrease with increasing altitude e.g. mean annual temperatures for
Lichinga (Niassa Province) at 1350 m asi is 180 C and absolute minimum temperatures reaching
freezing point may occur during the winter months.
The striking feature of the climate of Mozambique is the similarity in rainfall patterns across
Mozambique. There is a distinct rainy season between November to March and a distinct dry
season between the months of March and October. This climate pattern is characteristic of
savanna biomes in general (see Figure 8).
Winds are light to moderate. Most stations in the southem lowlands record mean annual speeds
of 6-8 km/hr, but high winds of up to 100 kin/ accompany summer storms. Most of the
country experiences at least 3000 hours of sunshine a year (8 hr/day).
Cyclones are generated in the south-west Indian Ocean from November to April. On average,
15 to 20 cyclones are generated annually during this season, some of which may reach the
Mozambican coast especially in February and March. Cyclone paths generated over the Indian
Ocean between 1980 and 2000 are shown in Figure 9. Over the last forty-five years, there were
24 cyclones that strongly affected the north-central sector of the Mozambican coast (Table 4).

5 DRAINAGE
5.1 RIVERINE SYSTEMS
The main river system and lakes of Mozambique are shown on Figure 10. A description of the
main systems follows.
i   Rivers of Maputaland
The major rivers of Maputaland are the Maputo, with a catchment area of 29,800 kmi2, flowing
from Natal in South Africa; the Umbeluzi with a catchment of 5,622 km2, flowing in from
Swaziland; and the Nkomati which drains some 45,875 km2 and enters from South Africa. All
these Rivers discharge into the Estuario do Espirito Santo, Maputo Bay. The Maputo River has
a floodplain with peripheral pans and lakes, and it flows through much swampy land,
particularly along its east bank, for the full 100 km of its transit between the border and the
sea.
The Umbeluzi is impounded near Boane (the Pequenos Libombos Dam - filled in 1989) and
now floods irregularly in its lower reaches.
The Nkomati is formned by the confluence of the Nkomati and Sabie River at the town of Sabie
(25019'S/3216'E), above which, in Mozambique, both tributary streams have narrow
floodplains. Below Sabie the river flows north and east until it swings south and enters a great
marshy area, which develops below the confluence of many streams, some 13 km north of
Manhiqa (25023'S/32051'E). This region comprises lakes, notably Lake Chuali, and permanent
swamps as well as seasonal floodplain areas.
ii   The Limpopo System
The Limpopo is the second largest river in Mozambique with a catchment of more than
390,000 km2. It drains parts of Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe before reaching
Mozambique. Flows in the Limpopo River are extremely variable and it is often dry over long
sections during the winter.
Prior to the confluence with the Elefantes (Elephants) River at Quenelle (2407'S/3238'E)
there are swamps along the Limpopo, in a belt 1-2 km wide. Below Quenuelle the Limpopo
Floodplain, which is still comparatively narrow, continues until the river flow is checked by a
barrage, the Barragem de Macarretane, just above Chokwe (2431'S/33O00'E). Below this point
flood waters are controlled to some extent, but the floodplain widens as the river approaches its
confluence with the Changane near Chibuto (2440'S/3333'E). Thereafter it meanders over a
broad swampy floodplain to the coast where it flows into a wide lagoon after Xai-Xai. There is
an estimated 40,000-60,000 ha of swamp and floodplain below Chokwe.
The Elefantes River is a major tributary of the Limpopo River arising in South Africa where it
flows through the Kruger National Park. The River is impounded at Massingir.

iii   The Inharrime River & Drainage of Interior Inhambane
The interior of Inhambane Province, south of latitude 22S, has a diffuse drainage system. The
area north of Funhalouro (2305'S/3423'E) is characterised by innumerable endorheic
swamplets and seasonal pans, but in the south, there are swampy seasonal drainage lines
leading eventually to the Inharrime River System. From here drainage is to Poelela Lagoon.
Lake Nhangulaze (2400'S/3427'E) has a water surface of 1250 ha and is set in an area of
unbroken swamps covering about 60 000 ha. These swamps drain into the Lake which in turn
discharges via a small stream to the Inhassune. Sixty-five km downstream it joins the
Inharrime River which in total drains an estimated 11,850 km2 of Inhambane Province.
iv    The Save, Gorongosa, Buzi and Pungue Rivers
All these rivers are very seasonal in their flow regimes. The Save River has a catchment of
92,000 km2 and is impounded in Zimbabwe and the River is now seasonal. Lake Zinave
(3355'E) is the largest lake, some 2.5 km long and I km wide, associated with the Save River.
The Gorongosa River (not to be confused with Gorongosa National Park) drains 13,150 km 2 of
lowland flowing through swampy lands for 100 km to the muddy coast south of Beira.
The Buzi River rises on Mt. Selinda (2024'S/3243'E) just inside Zimbabwe. It flows NE,
picking up its major tributaries, the Lucite, which rises on Mt. Binga, and the Revue which
rises on Mt. Nusa (1845'S/3200'E), before being impounded in Mozambique (Lago
Chicamba) below the town of Manica. These upper catchments are all in high (1500-2000
mm) rainfall zones. In its lower reaches the Buzi drains swampy land. Tall grasses cover the
floodplains, with clumps of trees, including Borassus palms.
The Pungue River rises on the western side of Mt. Nyangani (2000 m asl) in Zimbabwe, and
then flows over waterfalls and cataracts and through gorges in a rapid descent to an altitude of
500 m. Thereafter, it flows east, supporting riverine and hygrophilous forest on its banks, and
then south-east towards the coast at Beira, collecting numerous tributaries en route. The most
important of these is the Urema which flows through Gorongosa National Park. This develops
from headwater streams and the permanent aquifer of the Gorongosa Massif. The swamps
along the lower reaches of the Pungue reach 15 km in width up to Nhamatanda
(19018'S/34 l lE).
v    The Lower Zambezi River
The Zambezi enters Mozambique at Zumbo (1536'S/3030'E) where it immediately swells
into the impoundment of Lake Cahora Bassa.
It leaves the lake in a narrow gorge some 35 km long, then descends the Quebrabasa Rapids
and flows south-eastwards in a narrow valley along the floor of the Tete Basin. It receives
tributaries flowing down from the rocky highlands of Zimbabwe in the south and from Zambia
and Malawi in the north. At Tete (1609'S/3335'E), the valley floor begins to broaden and the

IMPACTO Lda                                                             4i-SMEC
river develops a narrow floodplain. There is a floodplain up to 5 km wide and about 40 km
long on the south bank between Tambara (1645'S/3416'E) and Chiramba (1655'S/3439'E),
and swamps around Lake Lifamba on the north bank opposite Tambara. For much of its course
between Tete and its delta, the bed of the Zambezi is 1-5 km wide.
The most important tributary of the Zambezi in its lower course is the Shire River, which
drains Lake Malawi via Elephant Marsh. Below this the whole Shire Valley is swampy. There
is an extensive lake/swamp system just above the confluence of the Shire and Zambezi Rivers
(17 42'S/3520'E) near Mutarara of which Lake Mimbingue (5x3 km) is the largest.
Development has been quite intensive down the Zambezi Valley below Senna, and sections of
the floodplain, e.g. between Caia and Quelimane have been recovered for coconut plantations
and part of the delta has been converted to sugar plantations. The huge dual impoundments of
Kariba and Cahora Bassa have also affected the downstream flooding regime. The delta is
characterized by a large swampy floodplain especially on the southem bank covering an area
of 18,000 km2.
vi    Rivers of Zambezia Province
The major perennial rivers of Zambezia Province, the Licungo (Lugela), Raraga, M'Iela,
Molocue, Ligonha and Meluli. The largest, the Licungo has a catchment of 22 726 km2 and is
336 km long, but the others are significantly smaller. The Licungo has sources high on the
slopes of Mt. Mulanje (3000 m) in Malawi (1600'S/3537'E), and on Mt. Namuli in the
wettest part of Mozambique. Mean annual rainfall exceeds 2200 mm in both source regions.
Upstream these rivers support riverine forest and thicket forests, or patchy reed swamps, but on
the plain they are flanked by extensive belts of swamp forest and herbaceous swamp, grading
into tidal swamps towards the coast. In proceeding north-eastwards up the coast the succeeding
rivers carry less water. Although the Ligonha is the second largest stream it drains a drier
catchment and usually floods less than the other stretches.
vii   Rivers of The North-East Coast
The most northerly and largest river on this coast, the Rovuma, has a catchment of 155,400
km2 and is the third largest river in Mozambique. It forms the border between Mozambique
and Tanzania for some 700 km, almost the entire length of the border. The river has sources in
both countries on the mountains at the eastem edge of the Rift Valley and receives numerous
important tributaries on both banks. Two thirds of the catchment (101,160 kmi2) lies in
Mozambique and one third (54,240 kM2) in Tanzania. Below Gomba (1123'S/3830'E) the
gradient is gentle and the Rovuma traverses a widening, coastal valley for 130 km in an almost
straight line. Here the river floods seasonally, but almost exclusively on the Mozambican side.
Swamps occur along the river in its lowest 40 km, becoming more frequent towards the mouth.
The Nhica Swamp (1037'S 4016'E), occupying some 7500 ha, and over is km long, on the
south bank, is among the largest. Others are the Quitemba Swamp (1057'S/14013'E) and,
farther from the river, the Miula Swamp (1010'S/4016'E). The former covers 2500 ha and the
latter about 7000 ha. A number of lakes occur on the floodplains along the south bank. Of
these, Lake Nangade (I 1103'S/13942'E) is the most important. It is 12 km long and covers
5700 ha.

All the rivers on the NE coast, the Rovuma, Messalo, Montepuez, Megaruma, Lurio, Mecuburi
and Monapo, have very seasonal flows, and carry less alluvium and water to the coast (Cabo
Delgado and Nampula Provinces) than those which reach the sea in Zambezia Province.
They have narrow sections of riverine swamp along their middle courses and along their
tributaries. The lower course of the Montepuez spreads into a long narrow lake (about 30 km
long) immediately prior to the coast (Lake Biribizi).
5.2 LAKE SYSTEMS
Major lakes of Mozambique were shown on Figure 9 and are discussed below. Some lakes
were discussed with their related rivers in the previous section.
i   Lake Cahora Bassa
Lake Cahora Bassa is a man-made reservoir created in 1975 and located on the Zambezi River
at 15029'-16000'S/30028'-32043'E. The lake covers an area of 2,665 km2 and is the fourth
largest man made lake in Africa.
ii   Lake Niassa
The largest natural lake in Mozambique is Lake Niassa (also known as Lake Malawi). Lake
Niassa lies 474 m above mean sea level in the Rift Valley. With a surface area of between
24,504 km2 and 30,800 km2 it is the third largest lake in Africa and the world's third deepest.
Lake Niassa is shared by Mozambique, Malawi and Tanzania. Mozambican territory occupies
6400 km2 (20.8%) of this area with a shoreline of about 250 km.
In the south Lake Niassa is drained by the Shire River through a series of marshy alluvial
plains (Elephant Swamp) which flows south along the Rift Valley floor to meet the Zambezi.
Lake Niassa supports one of the greatest diversity of fish species in the world with high levels
of endemism. The Lake is especially well known for its spectacular diversity of its endemic
cichlid fish fauna (Ribbink, 1987).
iii   Lake Amaramba
Lake Amaramba (1422'-1440'S/3552-3558'E) covers an area of about 8350 ha (4350 ha
open water + 4000 ha swamp) and lies 635 m asl. The Lake lies in a shallow depression with
much swamp land to the south and east. It drains part of Malawi, with a small river entering its
southern extremity, but in wet periods it becomes continuous with Lake Chiuta some 9 km to
the south, through a region of swamp land. The Lugenda River, the largest tributary of the
Rovuma, drains the entire system, leaving Lake Amaramba at its northern extremity.
iv    Lake Chiuta
Lake Chiuta (14'42'-14'47'S/35'50'-3554'E) covers an area of 32,000 ha (3500 ha open water
+ 28,500 ha swamp) at altitude about 639 m asi.

The Mozambique-Malawi border crosses this small lake in such a way that about 17 km of
shoreline and 2000 ha of water surface falls within Mozambique. The lake is 10 km long and
up to 3.5 km wide. Large swamps extend southwards from the lake into both Malawi and
Mozambique. In total these cover about 28,500 ha, of which about 6250 ha of these are in
Mozambique. A sand bar along the southem border of the swamp separates the Lake Chiuta
system from the Lake Chilwa system farther south. The lake drains into the Lugenda River via
Lake Amaramba.
v    Lake Chilwa
Lake Chilwa (1509'-1531'S/3533'-3550'E) covers an area of 185,000 ha (including
lacustrine swamps) and lies at an altitude of 622 m asl. The shore of the lake forms the border
between Mozambique and Malawi for approximately 26 km, but very little of the water surface
is Mozambican territory. The swamps, however, extend into Mozambique.

6 LAND USE
6.1 BACKGROUND
In comparison with neighbouring countries, the population density of Mozambique is
relatively low (an average 19 individuals per kM2). Most of the country still comprises
natural/semi-natural vegetation. Amajor land use is agriculture.
Agricultural production comprises two main socio-economic sectors. Firstly, the small-scale
family sector (the majority of the rural population)..This ranges from pure subsistence
agriculture to integration in to the market economy. The level of integration depends on agro-
ecological conditions and market opportunities. Secondly, the commercial sector (mainly large
companies) that is heavily reliant on capital inputs and land resources.
It is estimated that approximately 5% of Mozambique is under active cultivation by the small-
scale sector and only 0.2% by the private sector. Although the percentage under active
cultivation at any one time is low, the area of natural habitat affected by small-scale farming is
significantly higher. Small-scale farmers slash and bum mainly woodland to open up cropping
areas. After several years of cultivation a new cropping area is derived from natural or
secondary vegetation. The small-scale farming system comprises an arable (cropping) area as
well as fallow fields of varying ages. The overall area affected by small-scale farmers is,
therefore, much higher than the actual cultivated area.
6.2 FARMING
6.2.1    Small-sector Farming Sector
Most small-scale farms are derived from slash and bum of secondary or primary woodland. The
woody vegetation is felled in June/July and burnt in September/October prior to the rainy season.
The land is cultivated over a 3 to 5 year period after which it left to fallow for a further 3 to 5
years. Organic and inorganic fertilizers are rarely, if ever, used by the small-scale sector
Maize (Zea mays), intercropped with groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), cassava (Manihot
esculentus) and beans (Phaseolus spp.) are the principal crops. Irrigation is rain-fed. Produce is
mainly for home consumption (subsistence) although excess may be sold to supplement the
household income.
In the medium altitude (200 to 1000m above sea level) regions of Zambezia, Nampula, Tete,
Niassa and Cabo Delagado Provinces cassava is widely cultivated.
Maize is replaced by drought resistant crops, such as sorghum and millet, in semi-arid regions
(e.g., the interior of Gaza and Inhambane Provinces and Central Tete Province).
Cotton is an important cash crop for the small-scale sector in medium altitude regions of Sofala,
Zambezia, Nampula and Cabo Delgado Provinces. Cashews are also an important cash crop in the
58602 Annexure D                   December2000                               6-1

IMPACTO Lda                                                               jSMEC
aforementioned areas as well as coastal areas of Maputo, Gaza, Inhambane, Nampula, Zambezia
and Cabo Delgado Provinces. In coastal areas of Zambezia and Inhambane Provinces coconut is
an important component of the small-scale sector.
In low-lying wetland areas rice is grown. This is especially important in the floodplains of the
Limpopo River, the Buzi-Pungue floodplains and the Zambezi Delta.
Farmers rear small livestock such as goats, chickens and ducks. Cattle distribution is restricted by
the Tsetse fly. Only a few peasant farmers presently own cattle as most farmers lost their cattle
during the armed conflict. Traditionally cattle are important as draft power.
6.2.2    Commercial Sector
This sector is traditionally associated with large companies dedicated mainly to specialised and
intensive agricultural production such as coconut plantations, fruit trees, tea, cotton, sisal,
sugar cane, coffee and livestock production. Several of these companies have a long historical
association with Mozambique the most notable being MADAL, Sena Sugar Estates,
Companhia da Zambezia (Zambezia Province), Marromeu Sugar Estate, Buzi Sugar Estate
(Sofala Province) and Maragra Sugar Estate (Maputo Province).
The total land area occupied by the private sector is relatively low (1,446 square kilometres or
0.2% of the territory of Mozambique. However, private sector farms occupy some of the most
fertile soils most notably the alluvial soils of the Limpopo and Buzi/Pungue Valley and
Zambezia Delta.
6.3 MAIN LAND USE PATTERNS PER PROVINCE
6.3.1    Maputo Province
The soils of Maputo Province are mainly sandy or sandy loam texture. The family sector
farmers cultivate maize, cowpea, peanuts and cassava.
Alluvium soils occur the Nkomati, Umbeluzi and Maputo River valleys. These are under more
extensive agriculture by the private and small-scale sector. About 6,000ha is under sugar
plantation in the Nkomati valley floodplains near Manhica (Maragra Sugar Estate).
6.3.2    Gaza Province
The coastal area of Gaza Province has one the highest population densities in the country.
Soils are sandy and land use is similar to Maputo Province The most important annual crops
are maize, cowpea, groundnut, sweet potato and cassava. Due to the limited availability of
land, there is a tendency to intercrop all four crops. The production of cashew in this region is
one of the most important sources of income for the rural population.
Alluvial and peaty soils occur in the Limpopo valley. Near Chokwe, 20,000 ha is under surface
irrigation comprising medium-sized farms (4-50 ha, total 2,000 ha) and small scale-farms (5-4

Further downstream, towards Xai-Xai small-scale farmers grow rice, bananas and sugarcane
on small plots.
The interior of Gaza Province has a low population density. It is one of the most arid regions
of the Mozambique with an annual rainfall of 400-600 mm. Due to the lack of soil moisture
sorghum and millet are grown in the region. The area has a high potential for natural (wildlife)
grazing and browsing.
6.3.3   Inhambane Province
The land use of Inhambane Province is similar to Gaza Province. There is a coastal strip south
of the Save River with high population density and a larger, drier interior with low population
density. Cropping regimes for these two areas are similar for Gaza Province.
The interior of Inhambane Province is characterized by large areas of intact woodland and
forest.
6.3.4    Sofala Province
The coastal region of Sofala extends from the Save River in the south to Zambezia River in the
north. The soils are generally sandy except in the Buzi/Pungue estuary and Zambezi Delta
where heavy textured alluviums occur.
In the regions with better drained soils crops of maize, sorghum, millet, cassava and cowpea
are found in association. Cashew and cotton are important cash crops in the farming systems.
In the heavy, seasonally inundated soils of the Buzi/Pungue floodplain and Zambezi Delta
areas the cultivation of rainfed rice predominates.
The are large private sector sugar cane plantations in the Buzi/Pungue floodplain (Buzi Sugar
Estate which is currently being rehabilitated) and the Zambezi Delta (Marromeu Sugar Estate.
This was recently privatized and is currently being rehabilitated).
The mid-altitude region of Sofala (200 and lOOOm above sea level) comprises mainly light
textured soils with some occurrence of heavy soils. Maize, sorghum, cassava and cowpea
predominate. In seasonal wetlands farmers cultivate sweet potato and rice. In this region there
is good potential to produce cotton. It is a region with a moderate to high population density.
6.3.5    Manica Province
Land use for the mid-altitude region of Manica Province is similar to that in Sofala Province,
namely the cultivation of maize, sorghum, millet and cassava. Cotton is an important cash
crop.
In the more elevated areas of the Province heavier textured soils occur and rainfall is higher.
Maize is the main crop. There are large areas of pine plantation on the slopes of the western
mountains.

6.3.6    Tete Province
The central portion of Tete Province (Zambeze valley) is semi-arid. Sorghum and millet
predominate.
The medium altitude region comprises land between 200 and 1,000 meters above sea level.
The main crops are cassava, maize, cowpea and pigeon pea inter-cropped in furrows. Farms
vary between 1.5 and 3.0 ha.
In the high altitude region of Tete Province (Angonia District) the soils are principally
ferrasols of heavy texture. In this region maize is the dominant crop, with a high production
potential. Beans and potato are also important.
6.3.7    Zambezia Province
The soils of coastal Zambezia are mainly sandy, except in the Zambezi Delta where heavy
textured alluviums occur.
In the coastal sandy soils the agricultural system is characterized by the production of cassava
and millet. Cashew is an important source of income for family farmers.
Agricultural production in the Zambezi Delta is dominated by rice and coconuts. This area is
characterized by the occurrence of narrow, elongated slightly elevated dunes, locally called
"morrundas", separated by depressions, locally called "baixas", which are inundated and lie
parallel to the coast. In the morrundas the dominant crops are cassava, maize and nhemba
beans. In the baixas rice is the dominant crop during the rainy season and sweet potato and
second season maize during the dry season. Cultivation of coconuts on the "morrundas" is
important.
The private sector has large areas of land in the Zambezi Delta regions e.g., Madal, Sena
Sugar Estates, and Companhia da Zambezia. Of the three companies, Madal is the only one
fully operational. It has operations in the Districts of Quelimane (coconut and livestock),
Chinde, Inhassunge, Maganja da Costa and Namacurra and Nicoadala. The Madal palm
plantation areas for each district are, 2,460 ha, 2,601 ha 12,053 ha, 2,204 ha and 4,057 ha,
respectively.
Sena Sugar Estates (SSE) operates in Chinde District at the village of Luabo. Here SSE has
10,000 ha of sugar cane and 3,000 ha of coconut palm plantation. At present, these areas are
being rehabilitated.
Mid altitude Zambezia Province is characterized by red sandy soils. The main crops are maize,
sorghum and cassava.
In the high altitude region of Zambezia (land above 1,000 meters) soils types are principally
heavy textured ferrasols. Maize is the dominant crop, with a high production potential.
Private sector tea plantations have long been established in the highlands of Zambezia
Province.

6.3.8    Nampula Province
The soils of the coastal areas of Nampula Province are mainly sandy. The main cropping
system is characterized by the production of cassava and millet. Cashew is an important cash
crop for the small-scale family sector.
The interior of the Province is medium altitude (200 and 1,000 meters in altitude). The texture
of the soils varies from sandy to clayish, consistent with the topography. There are two types
of cropping systems that differ by being dominated by either maize or sorghum. Cassava,
cowpea and groundnut are widely cultivated.
In the eastern portion of the medium altitude region cashew is very important. Cotton is an
important cash crop.
6.3.9    Cabo Delgado Province
Land use in coastal Cabo Delgado Province is similar to the coastal area of Nampula Province.
The soils are sandy and cassava and millet are the main crops. In seasonal wetlands rainfed
rice is cultivated. Cashew is an important source of income for family sector farmers
The interior region of Cabo Delgado includes the plateaux of Mueda and Macomia. The soils
are loamy to sandy. The dominant crop in the production system is maize. Sorghum, cowpea,
cassava and sesame are also cultivated. Cashew is also an important cash crop for small-scale
farmers.
6.3.10    Niassa Province
Most of Niassa Province is located at high altitude above 1,000 meters (the Lichinga plateau).
The soils and cropping systems are similar to the high altitude areas of Zambezia and Tete
Province, heavy textured ferrasols with maize being the dominant crop. Beans and potato are
also important components of the cropping system.
6.3.11    Main Land Uses in Each Province
The areas under cultivation by the small-scale sector and private sector and forest area per
province is given in Table 6.1.

1 BIOLOGICAL & PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS
1.1 TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS
The road begins at the town of Chokwe, located on the south bank of the Limpopo River. The
road alignment traverses a mostly flat lowland area and heads approximately south from
Ch6kwe for a distance of 31km. The major environmental feature is the Limpopo River valley
with treeless floodplains approximately 5km wide (mainly on the south bank). The south bank
floodplains are under intensive agriculture and there is much permanent infrastructure.
Scattered pans occur for some distance from the floodplains. The Limpopo floodplain is
subjected to extensive seasonal inundation.
On leaving the floodplain, the vegetation is moderately open, interspersed with scattered
homesteads and small-scale farms. This is essentially an open grassland environment with
scattered trees. Numerous small pans and wetlands occur in association with drainage lines in
this region. Between the Limpopo and Mazimechopes Rivers the route traverses flat terrain
covered by a mosaic of open to closed woodland.
At its southern limit the road crosses the Mazimechopes River (2431'15"S, 3244'30"E),
which forms the boundary between the Maputo and the Gaza Provinces. It consists of a narrow
meandering channel (i 20m wide) with banks lined by a narrow fringe of riparian vegetation.
Agriculture (grazing and cropping) is practiced on the margins of the river. A few households
comprising brick houses are located near the river.
1.2 CLIMATE
This section describes climate data, which was obtained over the last five years (Instituto
Nacional de Meteorologia, 2000) and is temperature, rainfall and relative humidity.
The southern coastal region has tropical humid to sub-humid climate, with a distinct winter dry
season. But within the coastal zone rain typically falls in every month of the year with the
maximum during the summer months. Rainfall patterns are erratic and unreliable, with
substantial annual variations, especially in southern and central districts.
Figure 1 shows the mean monthly ambient temperatures for the Macia weather station, and
Figure 2 shows the mean monthly rainfall and humidity. The distribution of prevailing winds is
dominated by southerlies (SW and SE) as shown in Figure 3 and no cyclones have affected
Gaza Province over the 1999-2000 period.
Throughout the year, mean monthly temperatures vary between 19 and 27C, but rarely drop
below 20C. There is slight seasonality, with a cool dry season from June to September and a
warm wet season from October to May.
The dry season extends from April to September and the wet season for October to March. The
distinct seasonality in rainfall correlates with relative humidity, with the dry winter months
being less humid than the wet summer months.

1.3 GEOLOGY
The underlying rock is recent Quaternary and sedimentary in origin, comprising of Post-
Karroo sediments of the Karroo supergroup (Figure 4). This base rock is overlain with sandy
alluviums characteristic of mature river valleys. This sedimentary platform covers much of
southern and coastal Mozambique.

1.4 SOILS
The Limpopo Valley is located just north of the project road and is characterised by alluvial soils
of which scattered patches are sodic or saline. Intensive agricultural development occurs on the
alluvial floodplain of the Limpopo River. The alluviums are the prime agricultural soils in the
region; poor drainage and a high water table may be expected in these alluvial soils.
Away from the river channel, toward the project road, coarse material accumulates on the levees
and the soils have a low salinity. The soil types intersected by the project road are predominantly
clayey and sandy 'Mananga', characterised by a deep layer and relatively good to very good
drainage.

1.5 LAND USE
Ch6kwe is one of the strongest economic Districts; a consequence of the extensive
transportation network, good natural resources and a comparatively more urbanised population
than is characteristic of most of the other Districts. The surplus in agricultural production
resultant from the interplay of these factors has been a major factor in increasing trade and
economic growth.  Ch6kwe is an area of great agricultural activity. Rural production
predominates; prevalent food crops include maize, cassava, groundnuts, sorghum, beans, sweet
potato and vegetables.
The reliance of the majority of the population on subsistence agriculture has resulted in a
dispersed settlement pattern and very low-density land usage. Most of the region is
undeveloped. The project road traverses through an area that has a very low population
density. Except for the first kilometre, there were no settlements situated adjacent to the road.
The road predominantly passes through inundated areas supporting wetland species and intact
woodland. The road access is also limited to 4WD vehicles after 26km and therefore traffic
volumes are low.
1.6 RIVERS AND WATER QUALITY
1.6.1    Rivers and Hydrology
The project road is located in the Limpopo River valley, south of Chokwe. The river flow and
floodwaters are controlled by a barrage (The Barragem de Maccaretane) situated upstream of
Ch6kwe, but the floodplain widens again as the river approaches its confluence with the
Changane River near Chibuto.
Old levees and river channels cover the entire lower floodplain; the abandoned channels
frequently giving rise to stagnant lakes and ponds. These are especially common to the west of
the river, reflecting the fact that the main stream has been shifting eastwards for the last several
thousand years.
Drainage throughout this area is diffuse in the main season, but in the winter it is concentrated
on the main river channel. The river is tidal for many kilometres and saline water penetrates
well into the lower swamps when winter tides are high. In 1957 the swamps spread for at least
8km on either side of the main channel, and the river was navigable for 57km. Today there
may be 40,000-60,000ha of swamp and floodplain below Ch6kwe.
1.6.2    Water Quality
River flows of the Limpopo River system are highest during the rainy season from mid-
November to March, with flows generally reaching a peak in January and February. River
flows are lowest during the dry season months of June to September.
Rivers are most turbid during the rainy season, when overland runoff and erosion are at their
greatest.

IMPAL'IU
Watercourses and wetland areas in the vicinity of the project road are relatively free of
chemical pollutants due to the absence of industry and settlements.  Its proximity to
commercial agriculture may have resulted in pollution from agrochemicals.
1.7 VEGETATION COVER
The road traverses two main vegetation types, including Acacia woodland and vegetation on
Limpopo and Nkomati Alluviums (Wild and Barbosa, 1967). Figure 6 shows the distribution
of this vegetation adjacent to the road.
1.7.1    Acacia Woodland
The main vegetation type in the area is Acacia Woodland (MU 48) and occurs south and north
of the Limpopo River. Acacia tree or shrub woodland is represented by an important area in
the region of Moamba, Magude and Guija to the Changane River. It occurs within semi-arid
zones with rainfall about 60mm per annum and on soils locally known as "clayey mananga"
and, in more restricted areas, on "sandy mananga". This vegetation type grades into deeper
alluvial zones, near the Limpopo River.
1.7.2    Vegetation on Alluviums
The vegetation on Limpopo and Nkomati Alluviums (MU 54) is characterised by fringing
forest occurring on the immediate margins of the riverbanks. The dominant species comprise
Ficus spp., Trichilia emetica, Kigelia africana, Lannea stuhlmanii and Xanthocerra
zambeziaca. Behind this fringe, extensive grasslands with Setaria spp.on periodically flooded
and badly drained alluviums. On slightly higher and better-drained ground a sub-arid open
woodland type may occur.
1.8 WILDLIFE AND CONSERVATION AREAS
1.8.1    Wildlife
There is an absence of large mammals in the vicinity of the Ch6kwe road due to a lack of
conservation areas within the vicinity and unsuitable habitat adjacent to the road. The
conservation value of the woodland for small mammals and reptiles is not known.
1.8.2    Birds
The Limpopo River valley and its associated wetland habitats are home to a diversity of bird
species; these species are listed in Table 2 together with their conservation status and the main
threats to their persistence. A complete list of bird species recorded in the Limpopo valley is
provided in Appendix A (Table Al).

1.8.3    Amphibians
The wetlands traversed by the Ch6kwe road are suitable habitat for a diversity of anuran
amphibians (10-15 species). It is possible that populations of the rare Afrixalus aureus occur
here. However, road rehabilitation is unlikely to impact negatively on this species.
1.8.4    Fish
There is a high diversity of fish species within the Limpopo River and its tributaries, however
no species of rare or threatened conservation status have been recorded.
1.8.5    Conservation Areas
There are no National Parks, Wildlife Reserves or proposed conservation areas located in the
vicinity of the Ch6kwe Road.
1.9 NOISE AND AIR QUALITY
Noise levels along the Ch6kwe Project Road, are very low due to the absence of traffic noise
and sparse settlement along the route. The noise levels are predominantly generated by natural
conditions (i.e. from insects, frogs and birds).
Ambient air quality in all of the proposed road areas is very good due to a lack of air polluting
industries and urban activities. Haze may be observed due to the frequently practiced slash
and burn agriculture and production of charcoal. Levels of airborne dust generated by winds
can also be high passing over agricultural fields, and smoke from woodland and grassland
fires.

2 SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
2.1 SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
2.1.1    Context and Administration
The purpose of this section is to describe the socio-economic environment for the EN405 road
in Ch6kwe District in Gaza Province. Information has been derived from existing reports and
publications where information is disaggregated at Provincial and District levels. Information
does not exist specifically related to the EN405 road. To collect specific information to the
EN405 road a field-visit was made to Ch6kwe District during November 2000 to supplement
information available at the Provincial and District level.
To describe the living conditions for the populations living along or in proximity to the EN 405
a variety of Provincial and District socio-economic indices have been used. Where possible
statistical information has been provided to enable the establishment of base line data from
which the impacts of road improvement may be made.
i   Provincial setting and administration
Gaza Province is located in the Southern Region of Mozambique. Gaza Province borders in
the north and east Inhambane Province, in the south Maputo Province, south-east the Indian
Ocean and west the Republic of South Africa.
Administratively Gaza is divided into 11 Districts, 44 Administrative Posts, and 122 Localities.
The Provincial Capital Ch6kwe and the towns of Xai Xai have Municipal Status. In terms of
area, Gaza is the fifth largest Province in Mozambique with a land surface of 75,709km2,
which represents approximately 9.5% of the land surface of country.
ii   Political environment
In the 1999 elections the ruling political party FRELIMO received the majority of the votes
cast in Gaza Province. Gaza Province is the birthplace of Joaquim Chissano the current
president of Mozambique. The first president of Mozambique Samora Machel was also born
in Gaza Province. This historical linage adds to Gaza Province strong political allegiance to
FRELIMO.
iii   Traditional administration
Traditional administration authority has no legal status in Gaza Province, although in some
districts there are close links between traditional authorities and formal administrative
authorities. The importance attached to the regulos varies from area to area. In those localities
where the regulo is strong and respected he will intervene in a variety of aspects of every-day
life. Such issues would include resolving social conflicts; allocating land for building housing,
managing water sources, supporting official health programmes such HIV/AIDS.

IMPACI'U
Like most parts of Mozambique, tensions exist between the two types of administrative
systems. These tensions increased during the armed conflict. Gaza Province was a strong
FRELIMO area during the armed struggle although there were significant incursions by
RENAMO into some towns in Gaza Province such as Xai Xai.
2.1.2    Population Characteristics
i   Population
The 1997 national survey estimated the population of Gaza Province at 1,062,380 inhabitants.
This constitutes the fifth largest Provincial population in Mozambique. The population density
for Gaza Province (14 inhabitants per kM2) is lower than for the average population density for
the country (19 inhabitants per kM2). The urban population (14%) is calculated on the basis of
the number of individuals registered in officially classified urban areas.
ii Ethnicity
The Changane are the main ethnic group present in Gaza Province. The languages spoken
reflect the dominance of the Changane ethnic group. 88.4% of the population speak Xitsonga,
the classification under which the Changane language falls. The other languages spoken are
Cichopi (6.2%) and Bitonga (0.5%). 2.7% of the population speaks Portuguese as their first
language.
iii   Gender
The Changane are patrilineal where inheritance follows the male line (father to son).
FRELIMO as part of the liberation struggle promoted concepts related to the equality of
women. With independence in 1975 these progressive attitudes towards the role of women
continued including the introduction of new laws, which attempted to enshrine protection of
rights for women.
Despite the advancement of the rights of women under independent administration,
Mozambican girls and women do less well than boys and men. Access to health services
directed specifically at women is generally very poor. Literacy rates for women are much
lower than for men. Family law in Mozambique still discriminates against women. A married
woman has limited rights to make independent economic decisions or enjoy full ownership of
assets, and a widow's rights to inheritance are secondary to males in the family. Girls in rural
areas in general marry young often as soon as they reach puberty.
2.1.3    Economic Characteristics
i   Economy
The economy of Gaza Province is largely based on agricultural. The most fertile areas relate to
the flood plain of the Limpopo valley, which traverses Gaza Province from west to east.
During the 1960's investment took place in and around the Provincial headquarters of Ch6kwe

for the commercial production of rice with the installation of a major irrigation system. This
scheme fell in to disrepair during the period of armed conflict and as yet no plans have been
established for rehabilitation. Recent figures for the period between 1996 and 1998 reveal that
the output of the economy of Gaza Province was the equivalent to $150 million a year
representing approximately 4% of the overall Mozambican economy.
The floods of early 2000 had dramatic effects upon Gaza Province. Tens of thousands of
people were displaced and lost all their possessions. The towns of Ch6kwe and Xai Xai were
completely submerged and major areas of Gaza Province particularly the most productive
agricultural areas were under water for several months. The floods caused major infrastructure
damage particularly to sections of the main ENI and bridges. Emergency repairs have been
made and the ENI is now open again. The floods caused significant reductions in agricultural
production. Approximately one-third of all crops with the exception of cassava were lost as
shown in Table 3. This loss of agricultural production has necessitated the importation of
basic food items to Gaza Province to feed the displaced population.

Gaza Province has good potential for tourism development. Two principal tourist attractions
can be identified. The first relates to the potential for the development of coastal resorts with
the main attractions of pristine beaches and the warm Indian Ocean. The beach resort of Xai
Xai during the 1960's and 1970's attracted significant numbers of tourist particularly from
South Africa. The resorts that did exist were largely destroyed during the armed conflict of the
1980's. Redevelopment of these resorts is slowly taking place.
The second main tourist potential relates to the development of the Trans Frontier
Conservation Area (TFCA) in the eastern part of Gaza Province. The recent signing of an
international agreement between South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique could potentially
create one of the largest conservation areas in the world. The imminent product of the TFCA
agreement is to be the joining of the Kruger National Park in South Africa and Coutarda 16 in
Gaza Province. This will create a significant tourist attraction enabling tourists to pass freely
across the border of Mozambique and South Africa.
ii   Poverty
According to the National Poverty Assessment (1996-97) 64.7 % of the population of Gaza
Province are categorised as poor corresponding to 690,547 people. This is below the national
average of 69%. Life expectancy in Gaza Province (45.6 years) is above the average level
registered for the country. Life expectancy for women at 49.2 years is higher than for men at
41.1 years. More than 90% of the population depend on agriculture, forestry and fisheries for
their livelihood, mostly comprising the family sector. There are few formal sector employment

opportunities. The number of people who have had any formal education is low and the
situation is particularly acute with regards to the numbers of persons who have attained any
form of higher-level training.
iii    Education
In 1998 Gaza Province had a total of 557 schools 90% of which were primary (EPI) schools
and 10% upper primary (EP2) schools, six lower secondary (ESGI) schools, and one upper
secondary (ESG2) school.
iv    Health
Gaza Province has a total of 85 health units. 86% of these units are categorised as health posts
and 13% as health centres. In addition there are 4 rural hospitals and one Provincial Hospital.
In 1997 there were 23 doctors and 558 other medical workers registered for Gaza Province.
The illnesses occurring most frequently in Gaza Province are malaria, tuberculosis, bilharzia,
intestinal parasites, acute respiratory infection, AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases and non-
specific diarrhoea. Current rates of HIV infection are 23% and are projected to rise to 27% by
the year 2010. It is calculated that 50% children under five-years suffer from chronic
malnutrition and 10% from acute malnutrition.
v    Access to services
Access to services for the rural population is generally poor. Most villages do have a primary
school (EPI) (92%), but these schools could be categorized as rudimentary and often
availability of teachers is very low. Less the 1% of villages have a secondary school. Most
villages have access to a basic health centre, but only 7.9% have a doctor, which nevertheless
is significantly above the national average. Dependence on traditional healers is the norm for
the vast majority of the population and almost every village would have at least one person
categorised as a traditional healer. Table 4 shows the availability of services on a village basis
for Gaza Province.

2.1.4    Livelihood strategies
The principle economic activity in Gaza Province is agriculture. Most food production is
within the family sector upon which the majority of the population is dependent. The principle
crop grown is cassava (total production 143,339 tons/metric for 1999/200 followed by maize
(total production 53,728 tons/metric 1999/2000), and beans (8,888 tons/metric 1999/2000).
Crop production and production per hectare for Gaza Province is shown in Table 5.

2.2 DISTRICT CHARACTERISTICS
This section describes socio-economic factors more specific to the ER405 road. The main
sources of information relate to existing written reports concerning Ch6kwe District through
which the ER405 passes.  In addition, a field visit to the ER405 was made during
November 2000.
2.2.1    Context and Administration
i   District setting and administration
The Chokwe ER405 is contained within Ch6kwe District located in the south of Gaza
Province. Ch6kwe District to the south borders with Maputo Province. Ch6kwe District is
divided into seven localities.
ii   Political environment
No information is available for voting practices based on the Districts of Ch6kwe. Gaza
Province voted strongly for the ruling party FRELIMO during the general elections of late
1999.

IMPACI'U
iii   Traditional administration
The traditional structure exists, too lesser or greater extent, in most localities side-by-side with
the more modem administrative apparatus of the State and political parties. In general terms
the first government of an independent Mozambique from 1975 attempted to replace the
inherited colonial and traditional systems with a centralised system based upon the political
doctrines of socialism.
2.2.2    Population Characteristics
i   Population
Ch6kwe District has 173,277 inhabitants (Census 1997) with 36,243 families with an average
household size of 4.78. The forecast population for Ch6kwe District as of 31 December 1999
was 200,656. Parts of Ch6kwe District were severely flooded during February and March
2000. These floods led to the displacement of a large proportion of the population mostly to
camps in other parts of Gaza Province. Most of the displaced population have now returned to
their home areas in Ch6kwe District.
ii   Ethnicity
The main ethnic group of the Ch6kwe area are the Changane. Succession and heritage for the
Changane are patrilineal, and the children are considered to belong to the father. Family
succession is granted to the eldest son. Changane men are polygamous and will take more than
one wife depending upon their economic status.

The Changane are patrilineal where inheritance is from father to son. Although the ethnic
groups are patrilineal, the prevalence of male migration necessitates that in many rural areas
particularly in Gaza Province, women run their families and livings. FRELIMO as part of the
liberation struggle promoted concepts related to the equality of women. With independence in
1975 these progressive attitudes towards the role of women continued including the
introduction of new laws, which attempted to enshrine protection of rights for women.
2.2.3    Economic Characteristics
i   Economy
The main economic activity for Ch6kwe District is subsistence agriculture. Ch6kwe town as a
District headquarters employs a number of civil servants as workers for the different
Government departments such as health and education. In addition, Ch6kwe is a major town
with a population of over 173,000 inhabitants. The District benefits from the economic
activity associated with a relatively large town. Better access to Chokwe District will
encourage more economic activity. Further agricultural production will be dependent upon the
rehabilitation of farming areas damaged by the floods. Irrigated rice is a major activity of the

District. A return of production will require significant rehabilitation of equipment and
schemes.
ii    Poverty
The main period of poor nutrition is the period between October and March when crop stores
are at there lowest and before the new seasons harvest. The principal deficiencies in dietary
terms for Ch6kwd District are lack of vitamin A and iron leading to a high incidence of
anaemia. There is a problem related to intoxication due to the poor preparation of cassava
mainly causing problems of vomiting.
Categorizing families in terms of poor, medium, and rich a survey has indicated that within
Ch6kwe District over 75% of families are poor, 15% to 20% medium, and 0% to 10% rich.
Table 6 provides examples of the characteristics of these categories of households.

2.2.4    Services
i    Education
Ch6kwe District has 18 primary (EPI) schools and 3 upper primary (EP2) schools. Most
schools are built of locally available materials (mud and thatch) and only a small proportion
from bricks. Boy's account for the majority of the schools population. The situation becomes
more acute as pupil's progress from primary to secondary. On average in Gaza Province 75%
of pupils are boys and 25% girls. The main reasons identified for the imbalance between boys
and girls at schools related to the early age of marriage (often as young as twelve), initiation
rites, and the lack of jobs for women after schooling. On average 63.2% of the population of

Sofala Province are illiterate with a higher incidence of illiteracy amongst women (68.8%)
than for men (32.9%)
ii Health
Ch6kwe District has 1 rural hospital, 3 health centres and 9 health posts. The average distance
for the population to a health facility is approximately 8 kilometres. The illnesses occurring
most frequently are malaria, tuberculosis, bilharzia, intestinal parasites, acute respiratory
infections, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases and non-specific diarrhoea. Sanitary
conditions are poor with most families not having access to a latrine.
iii   Access to Social Services and Facilitates
In Ch6kwe District there are currently approximately 74 shops, 10 trading posts, one formal
market, and 9 informal markets. Most agricultural surplus is sold in the towns of Chbkwe,
Xai-Xai City or Maputo City.
2.2.5    Livelihood
i   Livelihood Strategies
The families living along the Ch6kwe road are dependent upon subsistence agriculture. The
main food crops grown in 1999 to 2000 were maize (15,406 tons in 1999 to 2000), cassava
(576 tons in 1999 to 2000) and rice (535 tons in 1999 to 2000). Table 7 shows total cultivated
area by crop (hectares) and total production (tons/metric) for 1999/2000 for Ch6kwe District.
Livestock farming is very limited in the District. The extent of the agricultural activity is
dependent upon several factors, notably:
o fertility of the soil;
D availability of water;
o availability of good pasture;
ci availability of supportive transportation linkages to facilitate trade;
o availability of communication linkages to facilitate trade;
o population densities;
o availability of social services and amenities to support the population; and
o availability of supportive formal financial and credit institutions.
Production for the growing season 1999 to 2000 was severely effected by the floods. For
example, production of all crops was down almost 90 percent. It is likely production for 2000
to 2001 will also be significantly lower than normal years. The land is still saturated and the
concern is that above average or even normal rainfall will lead to more flooding.

ii   General characteristics of a family living along or in close proximity to the Chokwe
ER405 road
A typical day for a family living along the Ch6kwe ER405 road would involve women
working in the machambas. Women prepare the land, sow the seeds, weed, and construct
stores for the harvest. The responsibility of men is to cut wood and construct and maintain the
house. In the house women will look after the children, cook, clean the house, and would be
involved in most daily household activities including drawing water from a source often more
than one kilometre from the family house. The period of most work is between November and
February, the main period of cultivation and harvest. Women will control the household
stocks of food while men will be responsible for expenditure related to the children. The land
cultivated will belong to the married couple. In the case of the death of a spouse or divorce the
belongings will be divided between the wife and the family of the husband. Ch6kwe District
has a high rate of migration of adult males particularly seeking employment in South Africa.
As a result females in Chdkwe District take on a disproportionate level of household tasks
including those normally associated with men.
2.2.6    Archaeological and Cultural Sites
The road does not pass through or affect any specific archaeological or cultural sites. Any
work outside the road corridor would necessitate consultation with the Chef do Posto to
identify the existence of any cultural sites such as sacred forests.

IMPACI'(
3 POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
3.1 IDENTIFICATION
This section provides an assessment of the potential environmental impacts associated with the
road works extending from Ch6kwe to the border with Maputo Province. Environmental
factors considered were:
o  land use change;
o  erosion and sedimentation;
o  water quality;
o  hydrology;
o  noise and vibration;
o  air quality;
o  biological effects; and
o  socio-economic effects.
Each of these issues are addressed in sections covering the physical, biological and socio-
economic environments.
The majority of direct bio-physical environmental impacts will be minor due to the limited
extent of works at any one site and the incorporation of impact mitigation measures into the
improvement works.
Indirect effects, may result from increased natural resource use due to increased local
enterprise activity to service increased traffic. These impacts are anticipated to be relatively
minor as the road is already well established along most of its length.
Many of the potential environmental impacts associated with the construction of a new road do
not occur to the same degree when a road is improved within the existing road corridor. The
most likely impacts include:
o altered land use patterns due to improved accessibility, such as a change from forestry to
agriculture, or from agriculture to industry (Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997);
o  public health problems, particularly through the spread of communicable disease (Birley,
1997); and
o  increased illegal logging and poaching activities due to improved access into forest areas
(Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997).

IMPAC7'O
3.2 PHYSICAL EFFECTS
3.2.1    Land Use
i   Construction
The existing road narrows for the last 6km approaching the district border. Along this stretch
there is a mix of inundated land and relatively intact woodland. The proposed road works will
require clearing of vegetation.
The proposed road works will have no direct affect on land use outside the road corridor. Tthe
construction works will be maintained within the corridor and no realignment of the road is
required.
Temporary areas of land use change will occur as a result of establishment of ancillary sites
such as batching plant sites, borrow pits and workforce camp sites. These sites will be selected
in consultation with the landowner and will be rehabilitated upon completion of activities.
Ancillary sites will be located in degraded areas, where possible, to ensure that large areas of
land will not need to be cleared and the change to land use is not significant. Total land
acquisition will be minimal relative to the project corridor length.
Where possible existing borrow areas will be utilised to avoid opening up new borrow pits and
causing disturbance. The rehabilitation of these sites after completion of the works will be
undertaken through revegetation and levelling the landform to its original condition. Where
new borrow pits are established these will be located at least 100m from the road in accordance
with current ANE guidelines.
ii   Operation
The road works may have an indirect effect on adjacent land use activities, due to an increase
in development in the region resulting from improved road access.
iii   Mitigation Measures
Due to the short length of the project road, ancillary sites such as batching plants and
workforce camps could be located nearby the township of Ch6kwe and will minimise the
disturbance of woodland or wetland habitat. All ancillary sites will be rehabilitated upon
completion of activities to their previous land use.
Mitigation measures for other temporary facilities include:
Li measures identified under socio-economics for selection and negotiation of use; and
o rehabilitation of all sites to their original condition, or better, to allow resumption of prior
land use.

IMPAC"' 
3.2.2    Erosion and Sedimentation
i   Erosion Hazard
The dynamic interplay of several key factors dictates the degree of susceptibility to water-
driven soil erosion processes. These are:
oi seasonality and intensity of rainfall in relation to water run-off;
o landscape topography in relation slope gradients;
o soil profile parameters, notably depth and binding properties;
Li degree of vegetation cover; and
o magnitude and frequency of seismic events.
For road works in general, where the capacity of existing drainage works to manage water run-
off is exceeded then the interaction of the above factors will determine the extent and
magnitude of erosion processes. These considerations provide the basis to determine the
overall erosion hazard.
The erosion hazard along the project road is low despite the fact that it traverses alluvial soils.
These are deep soils formed on generally flat topography and therefore have a low erosion
hazard. The rainfall pattern within the region is typical of Mozambique with 80% of the
rainfall recorded between mid-November and March.
ii   Potential for Erosion and Sedimentation
Sedimentation is a secondary process of erosion and can be exacerbated by road works due to:
o deliberate and unanticipated modifications to surface and ground water hydrology;
o incomplete rehabilitation of roadside verge areas; and
o road rehabilitation through naturally hilly terrain.
Ground disturbance and the temporary stockpiling of materials during road construction works,
particularly in areas adjacent to watercourses and wetland areas may result in sedimentation.
The Sedimentation rates will be highest during the rainy season and can occur from the time of
ground disturbance up until sites have been stabilised along the length of construction works.
Overall, the low erosion hazard will be a function of the limited area of ground disturbance at
any one site, and the generally flat topography. The extent of works will also be marginal with
a general maximum width of 1 6m disturbed.
Sedimentation can occur from the time of ground disturbance until sites have been stabilised
along the length of construction works.
The fill for the road works will predominantly be obtained from existing borrows areas located
outside the area of the project road. These locations are subject to erosion if not graded and
revegetated after use is complete.
The installation of side drains along the road will minimise any sedimentation and runoff
effects.

IMPA 'LW
iii    Mitigation Measures
The impact from sedimentation will be minimised by avoiding stockpiling of materials near
drainage lines and wetland areas and by not undertaking construction during times of heavy
rain, particularly the months of December to March.
Ground disturbance and the temporary stockpiling of materials during road construction works
has the potential for sedimentation to occur adjacent to the areas of wetland. This hazard will
occur from the time of ground disturbance up until sites have been stabilised along the length
of construction works. The fill for the road works will be obtained from existing borrow areas
located away from the project road so therefore erosion potential at these sites will be minimal.
The provision of culverts along the road will improve cross-road drainage, reducing
sedimentation effects and scouring within drainage lines. This in turn will improve the
stability of road embankments and minimise sedimentation to the waterways.
Minor reconditioning of the existing culverts will be undertaken where their discharge is
causing downstream erosion. Specific measures for erosion and sediment control include:
o  design of drainage works to ensure these collect from and discharge to natural drainage
lines. This may not always be possible for mitre drains and in those situations frequent,
low volume drains are preferred;
o  provision of energy dissipation devices where discharge velocities and flows will erode
downstream drainage lines;
o  minimisation of disturbed areas;
o  design and construction of erosion and sedimentation controls such as diversion banks,
filter structures (filter fences or windrowed vegetation) and sediment traps;
o  diversion of significant upstream flows around working areas; and
o  undertaking progressive rehabilitation and revegetation of all slopes and disturbed areas.
In addition, temporary erosion control drains will be installed prior to the wet season and no
new road excavation will be commenced during the wet season.
There are no significant slopes that the project road intersects and no significant erosion
stabilisation measures, such as retaining walls will be required on road fill or cut areas.
Establishment of vegetation will be undertaken to prevent localised rill erosion on slopes such
as batters and roadside embankments.
The provision of culverts along the road will improve cross-road drainage within the wetland
areas. If the road requires raising along the wetland areas, embankments will be vegetated to
minimise the effects of sedimentation during times of heavy rain. However, sedimentation
effects are likely to be negligible due to the flat terrain and low velocity of the runoff.

IMPAC' iO
3.2.3    Water Quality
i   Construction
Sedimentation and resultant water quality effects were discussed in the previous section. This
section looks at other water quality issues.
Improper sanitation and waste disposal procedures in temporary construction camps can result
in pollution to water resources unless proper management measures are implemented.
Surface waters can be contaminated by fuel and lubricants as a result of improper disposal
facilities and poor operation practices for construction vehicles and machinery. Improper
disposal of oil filters and other materials from vehicle and machinery maintenance can also
cause pollution. This can occur during both construction and road operation, but mostly during
the former.
Spilt petroleum fuel, as well as bitumen and explosives residue, also have a potential to
contribute to the pollution of water bodies, but to a very minor extent.
ii   Operation
Vehicles movements and the roadside maintenance of vehicles can result in the contamination
of water resources along the project corridor by fuel and lubricants. Oil and fuel from leaking
vehicles or from vehicle maintenance may enter rivers or streams.
However, this minor impact is occurring, and will continue, despite the proposed improvement
works. Improved road conditions will improve vehicle operating conditions and thereby
reduce such incidents. Road accidents involving accidental spills of fuel, lubricants, chemicals
or other toxic materials, which could reach water bodies, are likely to be reduced.
A direct accidental spill into a closed water body, such as pond (rather than in a flowing
watercourse), may cause a long-term and potentially irreversible impact, if this spill were to
occur. However, these are rare and random in occurrence, especially along the predominantly
agricultural road.
Borrow areas have the potential to result in adverse environmental impacts if they are not
rehabilitated correctly. If left in poor condition water can collect in the depressions created
and become weed infested and is a good breeding area for disease carrying insects such as
mosquitoes.
iii   Mitigation Measures
All fuels, lubricants and bitumen will be stored in bunded areas. Vehicle maintenance and
refuelling will be confined to areas in construction camps designed to confine lubricants and
fuel spillages.
58602 Annex E - Chokwe-Maputo Border  February 2001                               3-5



IMPAC7'V
Adequate waste disposal and sanitation facilities will be provided at construction camps. Any
wastewater or stormwater discharged from the site shall comply with the following objectives:
o  pH range                       6.0-9.0;
o  Total Suspended Solids (TSS)    <50mg/l;
o  Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)    <1 500mg/l; and
o  Oils and surfactants          No visible film of oils or petrochemicals.
The Contractor shall ensure that all bitumen and fuel storage areas shall be bunded to contain
at least 120% of the maximum capacity of the largest storage tank. The floor of the bunded
area shall be impervious, and storage facilities and bunds shall be inspected weekly for spills.
3.2.4    Hydrology
i   Construction
The road works will have a negligible impact to hydrology as the rehabilitation works will be
undertaken on the existing alignment. The main construction activity that has the potential to
impede flows will be the stockpiling of materials near drainage lines and wetland areas.
ii   Operation
The road does not cross any major watercourses. Although the road is an existing structure,
roadworks can cause an impedance to natural flows. The road will be raised along the wetland
areas and should be a nominal height of 0.5m above the surrounding terrain to ensure adequate
roadway drainage capacity. The provision of culverts along the road will improve cross-road
drainage, particularly along the wetland areas.
Adequate and stable cross-road and road surface drainage is essential to ensure that storm
runoff across the road causes minimal damage to the road and minimises the effect of
inundation caused by impeded flows. Cross-road drainage shall be provided by causeways and
culverts to pass catchment flows past the road, either over or beneath it. Road surface drainage
shall be provided by side drains to direct runoff off the road surface.
iii   Mitigation Measures
Particular attention shall be given to stockpiling materials away from existing drainage lines
and avoid filling in wetland areas.
All designed drainage works shall be installed at the time of initial road construction to ensure
that flows along drainage lines are not impeded.

IMPACT'0
3.2.5    Noise and Vibration
i   Construction
There are no sensitive sites, such as hospitals or schools, located along the project road.
Additional noise will be generated from the increased number of heavy vehicles during the
construction period, however due to the absence of settlements adjacent to the road, the impact
will be negligible. The increase in noise levels may provide a disturbance to the local bird life,
however this will be a short-term impact experienced during the construction phase. Peak
noise levels generated by construction activities are expected to be greater than the peak noise
levels from road operation
Vibration effects will be negligible due to the nature of the soil substrate and absence of
settlements. .
ii Operation
Accessibility will be improved following the road works but improvements are not expected to
generate additional traffic. Traffic growth is expected to low, and traffic noise levels will not
increase as a result of the project.
The project road is sparsely populated, and no sensitive sites are located nearby. As the
majority of the project roads traverse open cultivation land and wetland areas, the impact from
an increase in noise levels from increased traffic speed will be negligible.
iii Mitigation Measures
No national noise level standards exist for highway construction equipment, however the
World Bank recommends the use of construction equipment, which meets international
standards.
The following measures shall be implemented to minimise the impact of noise during the
construction phase:
o work compounds shall be located at least 0.5km from settlements;
o construction shall not occur between 19:00 and 06:00 hours at sites within 150m of
residential areas; and
o maintenance of machinery and vehicles shall be undertaken and repaired regularly to keep
noise at a minimum.
3.2.6    Air Quality
Construction
The deterioration in air quality from dust generation and vehicle emissions during road
construction will be a relatively minor environmental impact. Significant adverse effects are
58602 Annex E - Ch6kw6-Maputo Border  Februaty 2001                               3-7



IMPAU'IO
not expected because of the limited duration of construction at any one site and the few
receptors. Most of the work will occur in open, cultivated areas.
Deterioration in air quality during road construction will primarily occur from dust generated
by road works, spoil transportation and disposal. Most of the construction activities will
progressively move along the alignment, so prolonged deterioration in air quality will not
occur at any one site.
ii   Operation
Existing air quality is good and no significant air quality effects are expected during operation.
Traffic volumes are low and the road generally traverses rural road areas.
iii   Mitigation Measures
Minimising air emissions is particularly important during the construction stage, for activities
such as the operation of borrow pits and in-situ mixing of cement and sand, which have a
potential to generate high dust levels.
During the construction period, the following mitigation measures to suppress dust will be
implemented:
o  Water will be sprayed during the construction period at earth mixing sites, asphalt-mixing
sites, and on cleared surfaces. Water spraying will be undertaken during periods of high
wind, or when necessary, to suppress dust.
  Operations shall be suspended during periods of dry windy weather, in areas where wind
blown dust is causing a nuisance in settlements or towns.
L  All equipment and plant machinery shall not emit visible smoke for a continuous period of
greater than 10 seconds.
L  All exhaust systems and engines on plant and equipment shall be in accordance with the
manufacturers specifications and kept well maintained to ensure that they have a high level
operating efficiency.
3.3 BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS
3.3.1    Direct impacts
The proposed construction works will not affect ecological resources for the first 20km of the
road as the existing road corridor and side drains are currently of sufficient width. Along this
stretch of road the works required will be periodic maintenance.
There will be a direct loss of vegetation along the area where the road and traverses inundated
areas and dense woodland. The dense shrubland, approximately 90% vegetation cover, is most
likely due to the absence of large grazing fauna in the area. At this location the road corridor
will need to be cleared of the vegetation as part of the construction works to enable road
formation widening and construction of side drainage. The width of additional clearance
required for these works will generally be 6-lOm.
58602 Annex E - Ch6kw6-Maputo Border  February 2001                            3-8



IMPAC1VO
Although the absence of settlements has resulted in the absence of slash and burn agriculture
adjacent to road, is a lack of large mammals. The conservation value of the woodland for
small mammals, birds and reptiles is not known. However the road currently exists and the
level of disturbance required will be minimal in comparison to the road length. There are no
neighbouring conservation areas within the vicinity of the woodland and no known locations
for wildlife crossings.
The wetlands adjacent to the road appear to have expanded due to long periods of inundation
and along the last 6km, wetland species have established in low lying sections of the road
where access has been restricted. The wetlands in this area have not been identified as having
conservation significance and may recede again overtime when the groundwater levels
decrease, however they support a wide variety of birds and amphibians. Although the
construction works will impact on a marginal area of this habitat, the placement of culverts
will be required to ensure the road does not create a barrier and impede drainage.
3.3.2   Indirect Impacts
There is a potential impact to the ecology associated the indirect loss and degradation of
vegetation, habitat and species in areas adjoining the road.
These potential impacts are associated with:
oi improved access;
oL in-migration; and
o construction workforce behaviour.
The improvement of the existing road will provide improved access to the neighbouring areas,
thereby enabling easier natural resource access and removal. In addition, the improved road
may promote service industries along their corridors, resulting in a population increase in these
areas and an increased local demand for natural resources to service the new businesses and for
personal use. The main sites where increased natural resource harvesting is likely to occur are
from the woodland areas.
The population increase along the road corridor would be derived either from people migrating
to the roadside from the immediate area (i.e. the 5km region of influence and adjacent to this),
or from other areas. This in-migration has a potential to create an increased local demand for
fuelwood and construction timber, as well as other woodland products to support secondary
enterprise activities, such as forage collection for grazing animals. Hunting may also increase.
The proposed road improvements will follow an existing alignment and almost all woodland
areas neighbouring this road are currently accessible. The road will only increase potential
access to these areas, not open them up.
The extent of a road's region of influence on increased slash and burn harvesting and wildlife
poaching cannot be definitively bounded. These issues are of concern within the area, but in-
migration from the improved access is not likely to cause a significant increase in these
activities. The area of increased woodland resource use will be largely determined by access
and product demand, the ease of harvest and transport of resources to the roadside and to the
market, and the creation of additional resource demands along the roadside. Ecological

degradation in areas adjoining the road is likely to be greatest near the road and is likely to
continue to occur over an extended period of time due to the extended use of woodland
resources by local communities.
3.3.3    Mitigation Measures
i   Direct Impacts
Vegetation clearance along the road edge and at ancillary sites (such as borrow pits) will be
minimised. All construction areas will be clearly marked and construction activity prohibited
outside the defined areas. Tress within ancillary sites shall be retained wherever possible.
Retention of trees within areas such as worker camps will improve the camp amenity and
provide shade.
All temporarily disturbed areas will be rehabilitated following construction. The establishment
of ground cover is the initial priority of revegetation. Ground cover reduces raindrop impact,
binds the soil surface and creates a microclimate favourable for the establishment of other
vegetation. Species should be selected for cover crops and permanent revegetation. A cover
crop consisting of a rapid growing species and several vigorous grass species should be used to
rapidly establish ground cover on disturbed areas. Permanent revegetation species should be
selected to be consistent with the local native species in the area.
Revegetation will aim to stabilise the road verges and assist the many desirable secondary uses
of the road including:
L production of forage, wood, flowers, fruit, medicinal items;
i shade and shelter;
Li fencing and screens; and
a building supports.
Revegetation along different sections of road will be designed to achieve site-specific aims,
such as maximising shade within villages and providing a species composition that is
compatible with surrounding vegetation cover.
Adequate and stable cross-road and road surface drainage is essential to ensure that the effect
of inundation caused by impeded flows is minimised. There are areas of inundation and
wetland areas along the road. These areas have experienced a change in habitat regime due to
prolonged inundation from last year's floods. In these areas, the road may form a barrier and
divides the wetlands into two separate hydrologic bodies.
It is recommended that a wetland ecologist inspect the route to determine the need for
additional culverts or waterway structures to ensure connection between wetland areas on
either side of the road.

ii  Indirect Impacts
The most potential for indirect effects was identified to be associated with workforce camps.
This is a temporary effect but may last several years depending on the duration of the works
project. To reduce the potential for increased exploitation of natural resources the following
migration measures will be implemented. The Contractor will:
o provide and maintain adequate drinking and bathing water supplies;
i provide kerosene or other fuel source and stoves for worker use;
o educate workers about the responsible use of natural resources; and
o ensure workers act in a responsible manner and apply penalties for the harvesting of local
resources (wood, wildlife or wood products).
3.4 SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS
3.4.1    Direct impacts
i   Loss of agricultural land, buildings, sites of cultural value, population displacement,
and natural resources degradation
Improvements to the road will not involve the significant loss of land although minor rerouting
is likely to be needed due to recent flooding. No buildings will be lost to road improvements.
There will not be any displacement of population due to the road improvements.
Where an area of cultivated land has to be resumed for road construction, the farmer will be
compensated for loss of production. The following process will be applied:
L where possible the farmer should be notified of the loss of land one season in advance.
This is to avoid unnecessary loss of effort and seed; and
o  the value of the lost production should be determined. Compensation will be paid to the
farmer for the value of the lost production.
Borrow pits, storage and equipment areas, and construction camps will be located on marginal
or disturbed land. The acquiring of land for such purposes must be subject to ANE and
Provincial approval. In selecting land consultation must also be undertaken with local
communities and their traditional leaders as well as local authorities (at District and Ward
level).
The Ch6kwe road passes through an area of degraded miombo woodland. Improved access
may expose this degraded woodland to more depletion particularly in terms of production of
charcoal. This is discussed under in-migration in indirect impacts.

3.4.2   Indirect impacts
i   Access to services
Improvement of the E405 road is likely to have some socio-economic impacts in terms of
access to services. Availability of services to the populations of Ch6kwe District is relatively
good by the general standards of rural areas in Mozambique. An improved road would enable
for example sick patients to gain access to better health services.
ii   Improved access to markets
Poor communications has already been cited as a major problem, which perhaps most
importantly constricts the ability of the local populations to transport surplus agricultural
production to market. Similarly improvements to the road would enable goods and services to
flow more easily into the area particularly those associated with improving agricultural
production techniques and yields.
iii   In-migration of people
Improvement of roads in other rural areas within Mozambique leads often to increases in in-
migration as advantage is taken of the improved communication. It is probable that some in-
migration will take place particularly in areas in close proximity to Ch6kwe town.
Under existing Mozambican legislation all land belongs to the State. However, private sector
farmers may acquire long-term rights over land by obtaining a Title of Use and Exploitation.
Individuals may also seek concession rights over tracts of land to harvest timber.
Requests for "concessions" are lodged with an area's Provincial Agricultural Services. Once
access to hitherto isolated areas is improved following rehabilitation of a road it could be
expected that concession seekers will attempt to access these lands.
Although, at present, all land in Mozambique belongs to the State the defacto situation is that
land is being managed and allocated according to traditional customary land rights. The
potential for conflict over land between local communities and "concession seekers" is high.
Very few traditional farmers have formalized their rights to the land under existing legislation.
Demand for concessions may increase as a result of improved access. To assist traditional
landholders in future ownership debates, the existing traditional land "ownership" should be
mapped within the roads region of influence (taken to be five kilometres either side of the
road). This should be undertaken at the road design phase to reduce the later potential for
conflict between traditional landowners and concession seekers.
iv    Health issues
It is likely that the improvement of the road will necessitate the inflow of a number of
construction workers from other parts of Mozambique. The inflow of road gangs, particularly
into remote areas, has a potential for adverse effects. The most often cited problem is the one

of HIV-AIDs and other sexually transmitted diseases. Mitigation measures against these likely
impacts require working closely with respective government departments; local NGOs and/or
church based organisations, local communities, and road gangs. Educational programmes for
the local populations are considered to be extremely important in trying to reduce the
likelihood of HIV-AIDs infection.
v    Construction worker camps
The health issues related to construction worker camps particularly in terms of the spread of
HIV-AIDs and other sexually transmitted diseases have been mentioned above.  A
concentration of workers also attracts other inward migrants who attempt to exploit new
market opportunities. Such informal sites are often poorly managed in terms of adherence to
health regulations and waste disposal. Mitigation measures should include the identification of
suitable sites for the establishment of small shops and other facilities servicing road-gangs.
In conclusion road improvements to the ER405 will have positive impacts. Improved
communication would improve the ability of local populations to transport surplus agricultural
production to market. It would also likely to stimulate more production if farmers knew they
had a means of transporting their goods. Ch6kwe town would be a significant beneficiary of
road improvements to the ENR405 road. The main negative socio-economic impacts relate to
the problem of the spread of HIV-AIDs infection. Campaigns in other parts of Mozambique
have demonstrated that these problems can be mitigated against particularly if resources and
education are directed at the local population and not just the influx of construction workers.
Further studies are needed to better predict probable socio-economic impacts, which would
occur as a result of improvements to the ER405 road.

4 UPGRADING AND MAINTENANCE MEASURES
The road works will include environmental impact mitigation measures within the Contract
Specifications. These measures will be incorporated as specific instructions and
recommendations to the Contractor and will be provided in a separate Environmental
Management Plan (EMP). The EMP will identify specific instructors to the Contractor and
will include responsibilities, outputs, costs and timing of mitigation measures.
Design, construction and maintenance mitigation recommendations for the proposed roads
have been formulated to avoid or mitigate potential bio-physical impacts.   These
recommendations were primarily formulated from observations made during the inspection of
constructed roads.
The EMP describes the practical means to ensure effective implementation of the mitigation
measures recommended for the potential adverse environmental impacts identified in the EIA.
The EMP will include but will not be limited to the following elements:
u practical means to implement the recommended mitigation measures;
u implementation of a schedule and supervision programme;
u monitoring and evaluation;
Li institutional strengthening, management and training; and
u further studies of environmental issues.
In addition, the program also specifies what action will be taken and by whom in the event that
the proposed mitigation measures fail, either partially or totally, to achieve the level of
environmental protection expected.
An outline of the EMP for the construction and operation stage is provided in Part E of this
report.

IMPAC TO
1 BIOLOGICAL & PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS
1.1 INTRODUCTION
The long stretch of the ENI follows the coastal plain of southern Mozambique for a distance of
950km. Baseline descriptions of biophysical parameters are provided for its entire length,
mainly in the form of distribution maps (geology, soils, vegetation) and histograms (rainfall,
temperature, humidity). For the purpose of describing the salient biological and physical
features of the road was divided into four sections from south to north:
o Maputo to Xai Xai;
o Xai Xai to Inhambane;
o Inhambane to the Save River; and
o Muxungue to Inchope.
1.2 TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS
1.2.1    Maputo to Xai Xai
The ENI passes through many peripheral residential and semi-industrial neighborhoods of
Maputo City before it enters a gently undulating plain on the outskirts of Marracuene on the
banks of the Inkomati River.
The coastal plain north and south of the Maputo Estuary is relatively flat. However, ridges
rising between 1 20m and 200m are located inland. The Matola River, a fairly old, shallow and
wide river (average 15m deep and 1.5km wide) drains into the Maputo Bay (Enpro, 1998).
The estuary is bordered by mangrove of varying height followed by a mosaic of reed swamps
and halophytic vegetation and in more elevated sites, dune vegetation with reed beds (Impacto,
1998).
The major landscape feature is the Inkomati River valley. Along this section the road traverses
the mature river valley close to the river mouth. In this area there are extensive wetlands
associated with the river. Between the Inkomati and Limpopo River valleys, the road traverses
a flat to slightly undulating landscape of secondary woodland and small-scale farms.
The road limit is adjacent to the wetland system of the Espirito Santo Estuary. Two rivers
drain into the Espirito Santo Estuary, namely the Umbeluzi and Infulene Rivers. It is an area
characterised by the following habitat types: mangrove, mosaic of swamps and grassland
interspersed with farmed areas.
1.2.2    Xai Xai to Inhambane
The Xai-Xai - Inhambane section of the EN1 traverses the low-lying coastal plains of southern
Mozambique and rarely does the road pass over elevations greater than 100m above sea level
(asl). The Limpopo Valley dominates the landscape on the initial southern stretch. The coastline is

IMPAC LW
characterised by a series of high (parabolic) dunes generally parallel to the coast, which normally
attain their highest elevations just inland of the high water mark. Behind these dunes occur
depressed areas with coastal barrier lakes and related dunes.
1.2.3   Inhambane to the Save River
Along this section of road, the topography is uniformly flat and low-lying, never exceeding
1OOm asl. The coast is characterised by northward pointing sand spits, which shelter a calm
mangrove-fringed bay.
The road runs adjacent to the Govuro River for approximately 90km. The river is entirely
coastal and the road is located about 5km to the east resulting in a flat topography and low
lying areas subject to inundation with seasonal and perrnanent wetland habitats.
1.2.4    Muxungue to Inchope
The Muxungue - Inchope section of the ENI traverses undulating to hilly terrain. The road gently
inclines to a landscape of small Mountains and rocky whale back outcrops along the last 1 Okm of
the road section as it approaching Inchope.
This landscape is characterised by spectacular granitic outcrops formed by the Rift Valley as a
result of tectonic movement and uplift.
1.3 CLIMATE
The southern coastal region has a tropical humid to sub-humid climate, with a distinct winter
dry season. Within the coastal zone rain typically falls in every month of the year with the
maximum during the summer months. Rainfall patterns are erratic and unreliable, with
substantial annual variations, especially in southern and central districts. Climatic data were
obtained from four weather stations to ensure that latitudinal variation in climate along this
long stretch of road is adequately characterised. The stations are:
o Maputo (Maputo to Xai Xai);
o Macia (Xai Xai to Inhambane);
o Inharrime (Inhambane to the Save River); and
o Mambone (Muxungue to Inchope).
For the climate variables temperature, rainfall and relative humidity, five years of the most
recent data are summarised. Figure 1 displays mean monthly ambient temperatures for the
four weather stations.

Figure 1:    Mean monthly ambient temperatures
Throughout the year mean monthly temperatures vary between 19 and 27C and do not vary
significantly with latitude. Mean temperatures rarely drop below 20C. There is a slight
seasonality with a cool, dry season from May to September and a warm, wet season from
October to April.

Figure 3:     Mean monthly rainfall
Despite the distinct seasonality in rainfall, relative humidity remains more or less constant
throughout the year. The dry season extends from April to September and the wet season for
October to March. The rainfall pattern is broadly comparable for the four stations and appears
to be independent of latitude.
The distribution of prevailing winds is presented in Figure 4. Unlike rainfall and temperature,
prevailing winds change with changing latitude. In the south and central regions, prevailing
winds are southerlies, while in the north they are predominantly from the east (E and NE).

Figure 4:    Prevailing winds (1995-1999)
Over the period 1999-2000, two cyclones affected this coastal area of southern Mozambique
(Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia) causing flooding, damage to infrastructures, and
disruption of services.
1.4 GEOLOGY
The coastal plain of Mozambique is composed of unconsolidated, but compacted, Quaternary
to recent sediments, mostly of sand, interspersed with silt and clay at the larger river mouths.
The regional geology of the southern part of the Mozambique coast comprises a succession of
non-marine, shallow marine, marine and estuarine sediments ranging in age from Cretaceous
(145 million years) to Holocene (recent age).
Between Maputo and Inchope the ENI passes over several geological formations, as described
in Table 1.
A map depicting the major geological features of the area traversed by this section of road is
given in Figures 5 and 6.

The road passes through the Great Coastal Plains, an area with heights less than 200m,
resulting from the Congo Cycle, which probably began in the Plio-Pleistocene (Afonso et al.
1998). The area contains sediments of the Tertiary and Quatemary, located South of the Save
River and along the coast.
Formations of the Quaternary are constituted by sediments deposited as a consequence of the
rise and fall of the sea level, an example being the accumulation of heavy sands along the coast

on beaches and dunes. This accumulation occurs at depths of between 2 - 8m and gives rise to
mineral fields of economic importance such as the Marracuene, Limpopo, Xai-Xai, Quissico,
Zavora, Jangamo and Inhassoro heavy sand fields (Afonso et al, 1998).
Marine sediments deposited in the clear waters of the infra-littoral environment mark the
Tertiary period. This sequence, on average 200m deep is characterised by calcareous Gres
grouped in the Jofane Formation. They have high economic importance being an important
source of raw materials including plaster and calcium for white wash and cements (Afonso et
all, 1998).
The ENI also traverses volcanic basalt formations of the secondary period, that fall within the
Karoo Supergroup - Stormberg Series (Superior Karoo). The Karoo geological formations are
important as they house coal and bentonite amongst others (Afonso et all, 1998).
In the region of influence (ROI) of the EN 1 project road, geological formations of the Pre-
Cambrian are found in Manica and parts of Sofala Province. Younger rock formations occur
in western Mozambique comprising granitic and migmatic gneisses, metamorphic rocks, which
belong to the Barue Formation (Hatton & Munguambe, 1998).
The region north of Inhambane is located in the sedimentary basin of Mozambique. The age of
underlying geological formations decreases from west (Late Tertiary) to east (Late
Quaternary). The entire region is bisected by a series of major gedlogical faults.
Four main geological formations along the ENI project road are:
u  Alluvium deposits (QAI) of recent origin occur as a wide expanse along the Limpopo
Valley;
  Coastal dune formations (QDC) of recent origin run parallel to the coast with varying
width;
n  The formation of interior dunes (QD1) of Pleistocene origin covers a large area inland
from the dunes, north and south of the Limpopo River; and
u  Marine sandstones outcropping around Lake Inharrime (TTm) - the Inharrime formation.
1.5 SOILS
Underlying geology and geomorphology tends to be a major determinant of the evolution of
soil types and their fertility.
A description of the soil types traversed by the ENI between Maputo and Inchope are shown
in Figures 7 and 8 and described in Table 2.
The main soil types include:
o  Alluvial deposits (unit F);
o  Sedimentary basin soils - soils of coastal dunes, sandy soils, Mananga sediments,
sedimentary rocks (units A, G, M, S, W);
o  Volcanic rock zone (unit B); and
o  Pre-Cambrian socle (unit K).

In the south, the basin of the Inkomati River is the major landscape feature, and can be
characterised as an extensive erosion plain gently dipping towards the coast and intercepted by
the valleys of the Inkomati, Sabie and Elefantes and by small rivers. The Inkomati has built an
extensive alluvial plain, inland from the coastal dune belt. Alluvial soils cover large areas in
the Inkomati, Sabie and their tributary valleys. The largest continuous alluvial deposits occur
in the Middle and Lower Inkomati, particularly south of Magude and in the Upper Inkomati
along the Sabie River. South of Manhica, the Inkomati drains an extensive floodplain,
periodically flooded, extending to the coast near Marracuene, north of Maputo.
North of Xai Xai the soils are closely related to geomorphological history, current landform, and
rainfall. In addition, there is a marked interrelationship between soils and vegetation types.
Most of the soils of the region are derived from recent aeolian, marine and fluviatile materials -
the larger proportion comprising sandy materials. Heavier textured soils occur as alluvial
deposits on the depositional plains of the Limpopo River.
Coastal dune soils (haplic arenosols) yellow to white in hue and low in organic matter occur along
the coast (DC). The soils in the eastern part of the interior dunes are mainly ferralic arenosols (dA)
yellow in hue with low to medium levels of organic matter. In the vicinity of Maxixe, orange to
reddish soil with a higher nutrient content occur (dAj). These soils are also classified as ferralic
arenosols. In depressions in the dunes where the water table may approach the surface,
hydromorphic sandy soils (Ah) occur. These latter areas occur scattered throughout this region.
The Limpopo Valley comprises alluvial soils (F) of which scattered patches are sodic or saline
(Fs/Fz). Alluvial peaty soils occur on the outer margins of the Limpopo floodplain at the foot of
the dune cordon.
North of Inhambane most of the soil types are of medium to low fertility. The only exceptions
are the soils of the Govuro River valley, which are fertile clayey and sandy soils. The western
region is dominated by low fertility sandy soils on underlying sandstones. Up to the Govuro
River, medium fertility deep red clayey soils predominate on underlying sandstone
conglomerates. Along the coastal zone to the east of the Govuro River, low fertility sandy soils
on underlying dunes, interior dunes and alluviums predominate.

IMP'AC'O
1.5.1    Erosion Risk
The existing information relating to the levels of erosion in Mozambique is fragmented and
lacking in detail. Generally, erosion caused by water occurs throughout the project area
although the problem is confined to specific areas such as towns and villages and the costal
areas. Erosion along roads is a problem requiring urgent attention (van Dijk, 1997).
Criteria for determining erosion risk with regard to road construction, rehabilitation and
maintenance (M. R. Marques, INIA pers. comm., November 2000) are presented in Table 3.
Table 3: Criteria for determining soil erosion risk
Property                          Risk                    Feature
Low          Medium       High

Depth to bedrock  > 60       40-60         <40            Depth to rock

inches
Depth  to  high  >3           1-3          <1             Wetness
water table (ft)
Slope (%)       <15          15-25         >25            Slope
Based on the soil types identified and described above, and in relation to slope and depth, the
soils along the road show low and medium erosion risk. A further description of erosion
hazard along the EN I is provided later.
1.6 LAND USE
Land use adjacent to the road was described from field inspections and the following maps:
o  1:250,000 forest cover, based on landsat satellite imagery and 1:40,000 aerial
photographs from 1990-1992;
o  1:250,000 land-use, based on landsat satellite imagery captured in April 1998;

1.6.1    Maputo to Xai Xai
Much of the initial stretch of this section (Maputo to Maccaretane) passes through a built-up
environment.
The Maputo area is characterised by high population density characterised by rapid
expansion of both residential and semi-industrial peri-urban areas.
As the road leaves the outskirts of Maputo, land occupation indicates that the demarcated
plots along the road are recent concessions. These are being developed for habitation
purposes and in some cases also for agricultural purposes. No large-scale farming occurs
between Maputo and Marracuene.
From Marracuene to Manhica, a significant drop in population density is noticeable, a change
that is reflected in the land use and land occupation patterns.  These areas are rural
environments with cultivated land and fallow areas with signs of bush encroachment. Prior
to Mozambique's independence in 1975, large plantations such as cashew nut plantations
occupied some of these areas. At present, the areas are mainly cultivated by the family sector
who practise subsistence agriculture.
The road limit is adjacent to a wetland system which is characterised by mangrove and
grassland interspersed with farm areas.
1.6.2    Xai Xai to Inhambane
Much of the woodland habitat, especially adjacent to the road, has been to converted to small-
scale farms and associated cashew and coconut plantations. Secondary woodland becomes more
prevalent moving away from the road.
The rural communities are wholly dependent on firewood for cooking and heating. Many
families residing adjacent to the road harvest firewood and make charcoal for sale to passing
motorists/lorry drivers to supplement their income. The most important being Brachystegia sp.
('tambeya') but other commonly used species include:
Acacia sp.                 'mikaye'
Albizia versicolor         Ivanganze'
Afzelia quanzensis          mstena'
Combretum sp.              Ichicucudze'
Dialium schleteri         'inziva'
Strychnos spinosa          massala'
Syzygium cordatum          'muhlu'
Terminalia sericea        'conola'
Similarly the interior dunes are an anthropogenic landscape of small-scale farms and patches of
coastal woodland.
Two basic agricultural systems, corresponding to each of the two broad geomorphological units
the road traverses, can be distinguished:

i)    Small-scale (peasant) slash and burn farming practised on the coastal sandy soils.
ii)    More intensive farming (large-scale private sector, joint venture schemes and family
sector) practised on the fertile alluvial plains of the Limpopo Valley.
i   Small-Scale Farming
Following the signing of the Peace Accord (October 1992) and the successful holding of
elections (October 1994), many peasant farmers have returned to their original homesteads.
Newly cleared farms have been established along most of the country's road systems with fields,
or machambas, often within 3-1 Om of the road corridor.
Small-scale farms are concentrated in the peri-urban area around Xai-Xai, nearby villages, and
between Lindela and Maxixe. Farms are derived from secondary fallow (as little primary
woodland remains) of varying ages. The vegetation is slashed/felled in June/July and burnt in
September/October prior to the rainy season. Maize (Zea mays) intercropped with groundnut
(Arachis hypogaea), are the principal crops although cassava (Manihot esculentus), beans
(Phaseolus spp.) and a variety of horticultural crops are also planted. Irrigation is rain-fed.
Produce is mainly for home consumption (subsistence) although excess may be sold to
supplement the household income.
Coconut (Cocos nucifera) plantations occur along most of the road between Xai-Xai and
Inhambane. These are especially extensive between Lindela and Maxixe. Tangerine and orange
orchards, mainly belonging to the family sector, are also common in the Lindela-Maxixe area.
Most small-scale farms have cashew (Anacardium occidentalis) and mango (Mangifera indica)
trees. Cashew orchards are particularly extensive in the Xai-Xai area but these have not been
well maintained and productivity is reported to be low.
Besides the introduced exotic species such as cashew and mango, peasant farmers maintain
several indigenous fruit trees on their plots of land as well as harvest fruits from the surrounding
woodlands. These fruits may contribute significantly to the diet of the local population, and
many species are used to prepare alcoholic beverages ('tontonto').
Farmers rear small livestock such as goats, chickens and ducks. Only a few peasant farmers
presently own cattle as most farmers lost their cattle during the civil unrest. Traditionally cattle
are important as draft power.
Families living on the dune cordon adjacent to the Limpopo valley floodplain grow a variety of
crops on the dunes.
ii   Intensive Farming, Limpopo Valley
Large tracts of the fertile alluvial plains are under intensive agriculture especially around
Ch6kwe and Mohambe upstream of Xai-Xai. Farming is less intensive in the lower Limpopo
Valley (in the vicinity Xai-Xai) due to the poor state of the irrigation system (Sistema de
Regadio de Baixa Limpopo) and partial localised salinisation of soils.

IMPACT'O
Where the plains are not under crop production, the extensive grasslands provide suitable
forage for herds of cattle.
The three main farming sectors practicing agriculture on the alluvial plains include Joint
Venture Schemes, Large-scale private sector, and Family sector.
Most of the co-operative schemes have been disbanded or transformed into family sector
farms. A wide variety of cash and horticultural crops are grown including cotton, rice, maize,
beans, cabbages, tomatoes, onions and garlic. Some farmers pump water from the Limpopo
River directly to their farms, and in some cases this has resulted in localised salinisation of
soils.
The local communities, especially those farming on the sandy soils, depend upon a variety of
natural resources derived from the woodlands and other habitats for their livelihood e.g.
firewood, fruit, medicinal plants, honey and wildlife.
1.6.3    Inhambane to the Save River
The main agricultural system is small-scale (subsistence) slash and burn farming practised on
the coastal sandy soils. More intensive farming occurs on scattered wetlands characterised by
hydromorphic soils.
While the general land use profile is predominantly undeveloped and agricultural, there are
variations within the region brought about by the influence of a range of other factors, which
include the availability of transportation linkages, the availability of potable water and the
suitability of the various areas for agricultural purposes (soil aptitude, climate, water supply
etc).
The agricultural activities of coastal Districts are characterised by a greater degree of trade
while based on much the same crops, but also include cotton, cashews, and rice as cash crops.
Fruit is an important dietary supplement throughout the region. Wildlife is still present and
game meat is an important food source to the populations of these Districts. Wood is used
for firewood, building materials and charcoal production and this has led to deforestation and
erosion. Livestock farming is very limited.
1.6.4    Muxungue to Inchope
The area is characterized by the Miombo forest (i.e. a low altitude forest), and small
cultivated fields. The forest comprises of species such as Brachystegia spiciformis and
Julbernardia globiflora.
Maize and cassava constitute the dominant crops being cultivated, but fruit trees, such as
paw-paw and cashew trees (cashew plantations reach an average of six trees per hectare) are
also present bordering most of the homesteads.
Settlement adjacent to the road is scattered and the population density in the area has
increased, resulting in more areas being cleared for agricultural purposes. The clearing of

IMPAL 1U
vegetation has reached sizes between 0.5 to 4ha, and has resulted in large areas of degraded
woodland.
People from the area make use of the road to sell coal, sticks/wood and firewood and game
meat (antelope and cane rats).
1.7 RIVERS AND WATER QUALITY
1.7.1    Coastal Barrier Lakes
A characteristic feature of the southern Mozambique coastal region is the extensive coastal
lakes, swamps and temporary rain-filled pans, which occur behind the parabolic dune
systems. Hill (1975) postulated that the Mozambican coastal plain is Pliocene in age and was
cut by a marine transgression. In the succeeding regression the sea left a series of longshore
dunes as sandy ridges running parallel to the present shore.
The present coastal longshore dune is backed over long distances by narrow coastal lakes
behind which are a second series of longshore dunes.
The most important coastal lakes from north (Inhambane) to south (Ponta do Ouro) are:
Dongane, Poelela, Maiene, Massava, Quissico, Nhambavale (2100ha), Uembje/Bilene
(3200ha), Muandje (2700ha), Pati (1850ha), Maundo, Xingute (1 150ha), Piti (2700ha) and
Satine/Zitundo (SOOha). These lakes are located on a plain of low elevation and are separated
from the sea by a well-developed longshore dune system except for Lake Bilene, which has
occasional links to the sea.
1.7.2    Rivers
From south to north, the ENI project road runs parallel to the Govuro River and crosses over
four major rivers:
Li Inkomati;
o Limpopo;
o Inharrime; and
Li Save.
The salient features of these rivers and their catchment areas are briefly described below.
i   The Inkomati System
The Inkomati has a catchment area of 45,875km2 and formed by the confluence of the
Inkomati and Sabie River at the town of Sabie (2519'S/3216'E), above which, in
Mozambique, both tributary streams have narrow floodplains. Below Sabie the river flows
north and east, again across a narrow floodplain, until it swings south and enters a great
marshy area, which develops below the confluence of many streams, some 13km north of
Manhica (2523'S/325 VE). This region comprises lakes, notably Lake Chuali, and
permanent swamps as well as seasonal floodplain areas. To the north of this swamp, between

IMPACI'TO
the courses of the River Mazimechopes (a tributary) and the Limpopo, there is a further block
of swampland which covers almost 50,000ha.
ii   The Limpopo System
The Limpopo is the second largest river in Mozambique with a catchment of more than
390,000km. It drains parts of Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe before reaching
Mozambique. Even so, flows are extremely variable and it is often dry over long sections
during the winter. It loses 185m in altitude along the 561km of its course through
Mozambique, thus descending to the sea with a mean gradient of only 1:3030. Having
entered Mozambique its upper course lies in a narrow and steep-sided valley, scarcely 7km
wide in places, until at Mepuze (2308'S/3215'E) the valley widens and the river flows over
plateau country to its confluence with the Elefantes (Elephants) River at Quenelle
(2407'S/3238'E). For some 150km above the confluence a narrow tongue of higher land,
carrying a plateau at an altitude close to 200m, intrudes between the two rivers. The end of
this is covered by hundreds of seasonal pans, extending over an area 75km long and up to
15km wide.
Prior to the confluence, are swamps which are fossil courses of the Limpopo River. These
two strip-like depressions, which are 1-2km wide, still collect water during the rains. Both
depressions and the riverine floodplain extend for unbroken distances of 20-40km, and, in
this region, there are approximately 17,000ha of semi-permanent swamps.
Below Queguele the Limpopo Floodplain, which is still comparatively narrow, continues
until the river flow is checked by a barrage, the Barragem de Maccaretane, just above
Ch6kwe (24-31lS/33O00'E). Below this point floodwaters are controlled to some extent, but
the floodplain widens as the river approaches its confluence with the Changane near Chibuto
(2440'S/3333'E). Thereafter it meanders over a broad swampy floodplain to the coast where
it flows into a lagoon, 8km long and 1.6km wide, before breaching the scrub covered dunes
in a channel some 200m wide.
Old levees and river channels cover the entire lower floodplain; the abandoned channels
frequently giving rise to stagnant lakes and ponds. These are especially common to the west
of the river, reflecting the fact that the main stream has been shifting eastwards for the last
several thousand years. To the east, surrounded by swampland and isolated from the river, is
Lake Inhamisse, with an open water surface of 750ha. Fossilised oyster beds, at
comparatively shallow depths in parts of the lower floodplain, indicate that marine conditions
prevailed in the region in Recent times. Drainage throughout this area is diffuse in the rainy
season, but in the winter it is concentrated on the main river channel. The river is tidal for
many kilometres and saline water penetrates well into the lower swamps when winter tides
are high. In 1957 the swamps spread for at least 8km on either side of the main channel, and
the river was navigable for 57km. Today there may be 40,000-60,000ha of swamp and
floodplain below Ch6kwe.
iii   The Inharrime System
The interior of Inhambane Province, south of latitude 22S, has a diffuse drainage system.
The area north of Funhalouro (2305'S/3423'E) is characterised by innumerable endorheic
swamplets and seasonal pans, but in the south, in addition to many little endorheic systems,
58602 Annex E- ENI Road Projects   February 2001                            1-9



IMPAL' 0
there are swampy seasonal drainage lines leading eventually to the Inharrime River System.
From here drainage is to Poelela Lagoon and thereafter, at least theoretically, to the Indian
Ocean.
A conspicuous seasonal water-course/swamp/lake system, about 1 km wide, runs
approximately due south along longitude 3424'E, from latitude 2345'-2359'S where it is
lost in the great expanse of swampland surrounding Lake Nhangulaze (2400'S/3427'E).
These swamps drain into the lake, and discharges to the Inhassunge River before jointing the
Inharrime River 65km downstream. This catchment drains a total area of 11,850km2 within
the Inhambane Province.
iv    The Govuro River
The only river of note along the road section between Inhambane to Save River is the entirely
coastal Govuro River flowing parallel to the coast from north to south, and located 5km to
the east of the road alignment. It has a catchment area of 11,200km2, with a mean annual
rainfall is between 800-1,000mm. A south-north orientated chain of small coastal barrier
lakes occur parallel to the Govuro River. The surrounding area to the east of the river
comprises mostly seasonal and permanent wetland habitats.
The prevalence of coastal lakes and lagoon systems is partly a consequence of the sandy
lowland nature of the coastal plain and the pattern of sand deposition. Changes in sea level
have stranded old coastline dune systems and lagoons inland and parallel to the present
coastline. Where coastal lagoons have become completely isolated, barrier lakes form. These
vary greatly in size, the largest have an open water surface area greater than 5,000ha. In this
region, these lakes are uniformly small.
Small affluent streams can feed these lakes while others are seasonal, drying up completely
during winter. Water quality varies widely. Temperature fluctuations increase with
decreasing lake size. Generally, the lakes are not saline, lying on sandy beds with substantial
organic deposits, pH values range from 4-7.5. The smaller lakes are often completely
occluded by emergent vegetation with distinct zonation according to water depth and degree
of disturbance.
v    The Save System
The Save River is very seasonal in its flow regime. It has a catchment of 92,100km2 and
along with its principal tributary, the Lundi, are impounded in Zimbabwe. Significantly less
water flows down to the sea than did formerly. The river crosses the country from west to
east, roughly separating the dry southern part of the country from the more humid north. For
much of its 330km course through Mozambique the river flows in a well incised bed some 1-
2km wide, but while in summer this may be brim full from bank to bank, its flow in winter is
frequently confined to a central channel barely 45cm deep and scarcely 50m across.
In winter the riverbed is a shining expanse of sand banks, with only occasional rocky or
sandy pools and pebble banks. However, water is never very far below the sandy bed, and a
little digging with bare hands generally reaches the water table. In some parts, a series of
little muddy pools lies close under its banks, which may be quite steep. Narrow swamps
occur on most of its tributaries, particularly those of its lower reaches, and between these

IMPA L'T
watercourses the country is gently undulating with hundreds of small lakes and reed swamps.
Sometimes these lakelets mark the meandering and indistinct line of what becomes a
temporary watercourse after local rain.
1.7.3    Water Quality
River flows are greatest during the rainy season from mid-November to March, with flows
generally reaching a peak in January and February. River flows are lowest during the dry
season months of June to September.
Rivers are most turbid during the rainy season, when overland run-off and erosion are at their
greatest.
Rivers, ponds and wetlands in the vicinity of the proposed roads are free of chemical
pollutants due to the absence of industry.  Despite this, these water sources may be
microbiologically contaminated near settlement areas due to poor sanitation practices.
1.8 VEGETATION COVER AND USE
1.8.1   introduction
The distribution and location of the main natural vegetation types occurring in the area
traversed by the ENI are shown in Figures 9 and 10. Wild and Barbosa (1967) classify
vegetation based on mapping unit (MU) nomenclature as follows:
li woodland and savanna woodland (south-eastern sublittoral) with extra-tropical species
(MU 34);
z  dry semi-deciduous (lowland-sublittoral) forest (MU 5);
Li dry tree savanna-moist grassland-fringing forest-aquatic flora mosaic of big river
alluviums and deltas (lowland, sublittoral) (MU 54);
o deciduous miombo (north-eastern lowland and escarpment) savanna woodland (MU 29);
o  deciduous tree savanna with palms (badly drained, lowland) (MU 44);
o  littoral thicket and forest of recent dunes (MU 14b);
o deciduous miombo-deciduous forest (and savanna) mosaic southern sublittoral urron-gas)
(MU 25);
o  deciduous miombo savanna woodland (MU 23); and
o  deciduous dry miombo (lowland) savanna woodland (MU 30).
Each of the four sections of the EN 1 are examined in more detail below.
1.8.2    Maputo to Xai
The EN 1 project road from Maputo to Xai Xai (excluding the Inkomati River valley)
traverses two vegetation mapping units namely, woodland and savanna woodland (south-
eastern sublittoral) with extra-tropical species (MU 34) and littoral thicket and forest of
recent dunes (MU 14b) (Wild and Barbosa, 1967).

Figure 10:   Main Vegetation types along the ENI between Muxungue and Inchope
Woodland and savanna woodland (south-eastern sublittoral) with extra-tropical species
(MU 34, Wild and Barbosa, 1967) - an Albizia-Afzelia-Sclerocarya mainly open woodland
occurs between Maputo and Macia in the sublittoral zone of Mozambique south of the
Limpopo River. The soils are reddish, orange or grey, more or less rippled, sandy, with badly
drained or waterlogged depressions containing soils with black organic matter (machongos).
It occupies a large sublittoral belt in the extratropical zone from the southern boundary of
Mozambique to the River Limpopo where Brachystegia communities begin to be sporadic.
The annual rainfall varies between 900-1200mm. As the region is heavily populated the
vegetation consists mainly of more or less damaged woodland, patches of secondary
woodland and vegetation in which only the indigenous or sub-spontaneous fruit-bearing trees
have been spared.
The most common formation consists of woodlands (damaged or destroyed) with Albizia
adianthifolia, A. versicolor,. Afzelia quanzensis, Ficus burtt-davyi, Sclerocarya birrea,
Ziziphus mucronata, Strychnos spinosa, Trema orientalis, Ficus capensis, Syzygium
cordatum, etc. Understorey species have tended to survive destruction and give secondary
woodlands. These include variable combinations of the following species: Antidesma
venosum, Strychnos innocua, Tecomaria capensis, Turraea nilotica, T wakefieldii,
Vangueria infausta, Xylotheca kraussiana, Euclea natalensis, E. divinorum, Bridelia
cathartica, Artabotrys monteiroe, and Rhus macowanii.

IMPA C'U
The large areas in which only wild species (and some introduced species) with edible fruits
are left may be considered as "indigenous orchards". They adjoin the localities with dense
rural populations. Typical "indigenous orchard" species are Sclerocarya birrea, Trichilia
emetica, Garcinia livingstonei, Strychnos spinosa, S. innocua, Dialium schlechteri, Syzygium
cordatum, Vangueria infausta, etc. The most common introduced orchard species is the
cashew (Anacardium occidentale), which is now sub-spontaneous. Mangifera indica
('mango') is also sub-spontaneous in more recently occupied areas.
Treeless secondary woodlands are also common on sandy soils and often Helichrysum
kraussii is dominant with the following Leguminosae: Crotalaria mucronata, C. monteiroi,
Indigofera podophylla, I. laxeracemosa, I. preladoi, Tephrosia forbesii, Aeshynomene spp.,
Stylosanthes mucronata, Zorna spp., Desmodium spp., Alysicarpus vaginalis, A. rugosus,
Rhynchosia spp., etc. Non-leguminous species include Epinetrum delagoense, Corchorus
unodii, Oxygonum delagoense, etc.
The areas of scattered tree and shrub savanna contain Syzygium cordatum, Garcinia
livingstonei, Trichilia emetica, Afzelia quanzensis, Sclerocarya birrea, Acacia robusta subsp.
clavigera, Dialum schechteri, Strychnos spinosa, Terminalia sericea, Tabernaemontana
elegans, Vangueria infausta, Acacia kraussiana, Tricalysia sonderana, Xylotheca kraussiana
var globifolia, etc. In some areas the tops of the trees are deformed by strong winds.
There are also patches of savanna-woodland or thicket of Terminalia sericea, Albizia
adianthifolia, Acacia karroo, Sclerocarya birrea and frequent Aloe marlothii. Patches of
swamp forest occur scattered throughout the coastal grassland. Swamp forests were never
extensive and many have been drained and cleared for agriculture. The remaining relics rate top
priority for conservation. True swamp forest canopy trees are Ficus trichopoda, Syzygium
cordatum, Voacanga thouarsii and Rauvolfla caffia.
Littoral thicket and forest of recent dunes (MU 14b). This vegetation type occurs on
recent dunes or juvenile soils formed from sands of aeolian origin. The most extensive
formation of this type occurs along the parabolic dune coast between Ponto do Ouro and
Bazaruto Island. Some of the highest vegetated dunes in the world are reported to occur
along this stretch of coast.
The more common pioneers include Sesuvium portulacastrum, Scaevola thunbergii, Ipomoea
pes-caprae, I. ficifolia, Canavalia maritima, Sophora tomentosa, Sporobolus virginicus,
Dipcadi longifolium, , and Carpobotus juritzii while dominant tree species include Grewia
occidentalis var. litoralis, Diospyros rotundifolia, Euclea natalensis and Mimusops caffra.
At the bottom of depressions there is often Suregada zanzibarensis with Encephalartosferox
in the understorey. Lianes and climbers include Rhoicissus revoilii, Maclura africana, Uvaria
gracilipes, Popowia caffra, Landolphia petersiana, Sarcostemma viminale, C. rotundifolia,,
Cynanchum ellipticum, A. setaceus, and Cryptolepis obtusa. Epiphytic orchids such Vanilla
roscheri, Cyrtorchis arcuata and Angraecum sp. were recorded. The ground flora is generally
sparse comprising species such as Phymatodes scolopendria, Zamioculcas sp. and Gonatopus
species.

IMPAI TO
i   Threatened Plant Species
There is no up-to-date information regarding threatened plant species in Mozambique. The
following is a list of some of the most important species classified as endangered, rare or
vulnerable occurring in the Inkomati River basin:
o  Ansellia giganta (Pakama, in Changane) Orchidaceae. An epiphyte occurring in sand
forests. Endangered.
L Encephalartos ferox (Chiahanga) Zamiaceae. From the original population only a small
number of individuals occur scattered along the coast. Rare.
u  Bonateapulchela- Orchidaceae. Scattered in very low numbers in coastal scrub. Rare.
o  Raphia australis - Aracaceae. Natural distribution limited along valleys of small rivers in
southern Mozambique and Kosi Bay (in Natal). It is only recorded for one area in the
Lower Inkomati (Bobole). It is protected and a special conservation area around the
Bobvole River was created in 1961. Endangered.
1.8.3    Xai Xai to Inhambane
For the first 1 Okm the road passes through the wide expanse of the Limpopo alluvial floodplain,
especially well developed along the southern bank (MU 54: moist grassland - fringing forest of
big river alluviums). The floodplain dominates the landscape between Ch6kwe and Xai-Xai.
Most of the floodplain is, or has been, under some form of agriculture although extensive areas
of agricultural land on the floodplains of the Xai-Xai region are not, at present, under cultivation
presumably due to high soil salinity. Cyperaceous species are especially common on these
uncultivated lands indicative of the waterlogged and saline edaphic conditions. Other commonly
occurring invasive species include Ammania auriculta, Cynodon dactylon, Hibiscus canabinus,
Nesaea spp., Phyla nodiflora and Solanum spp.
A single remaining tract of rare swamp forest (about 0.5ha) remains on the turf ('machongo')
soils adjacent to the surrounding dunes about lkm north of Xai-Xai. Once widespread on these
soils, these forests have been decimated due to clearing for agriculture and harvesting of
firewood. Only a few individuals of representative tree species such as Barringtonia racemosa,
Voacanga thouarsii, Ficus trichopoda and Syzygium cordatum remain in this relic forest. The
drainage and irrigation canals of the Xai-Xai floodplains are poorly maintained and free-
floating, submerged and rooted aquatic macrophytes such as Azolla africana, Eichornia
crassipes, Lagarosiphon sp. and Phragmites australis are widespread in these canals.
For most of its length after leaving Limpopo valley the road ascends elevated ground and passes
over undulating dunes formed from "Save Sands" (MU 20: miombo woodland on sul do save
sands (Brachystegia spiciformis)). Here typical miombo elements enter the transition e.g.
Brachystegia spp., Pterocarpus angolensis ('umbila') and Tamarindus indica (MU 20). Along
much of this stretch human occupation is heavy and much of the natural woodlands have been
replaced by small-scale farms with coconut, cashew and mango trees. Much of the woodland
has been converted to small-scale farmns through slash and burn and only the more important
indigenous fruit-bearing trees are left untouched for example Garcinia livingstonei ('bimbe'),
Strychnos spp. and Sclerocaria birrea. Large areas have been planted with coconut (Cocos
nucifera), cashew (Anacardium occidentalis) and mango trees (Mangifera indica).

A belt of sublittoral forest runs parallel to the coast c. 20-30km inland (MU 5: dry semi-
deciduous (lowland-sublittoral) forest (Sideroxylon. Afzelia, Balanites) after Wild & Barbosa,
1967). This forest formation differs from the littoral vegetation or recent dunes insofar that it
corresponds to a belt of vegetation occurring on ancient dunes comprising tree species such as
Albizia spp., Afzelia quanzensis, Garcinia livingstonei and Sideroxylon inerme. The road only
occasionally passes close to this vegetation type.
These eastern dunes comprise part of the extensive parabolic dune system that runs in an almost
uninterrupted fashion along the coastline from Ponta de Ouro in the south to Bazaruto in the
north. The dunes are characterized by a vegetation cover comprising succulent herbaceous
species on the fore dunes (pioneers) grading into well developed thicket or forest on the taller
dunes on the landward side - (MU 14 B: littoral thicket and forest of recent dunes). The road
does not pass through this vegetation type.
1.8.4   Inhambane To the Save River
Beginning at the Save River mouth, three discrete vegetation types occur from east to west:
L  A narrow strip of littoral coastal dune forest (Mimusops caffra) MU 14B;
o  A narrow strip of Miombo woodland on Sul do Save sands (Brachystegia spiciformis)
MU 20; and
o  A broad band of deciduous Miombo-deciduous forest mosaic (Brachystegia
o  spiciformis, Afzelia, Sideroxylon) MU 25.
South of the Save River, the vegetation is slightly different. Vegetation Types MU 14B and
MU 25 remain but another two vegetation types are also present:
o An extensive area of tree savannah (Julbernardia globiflora, Androstachys johnsonii)
MU 36; and
o A narrow band of deciduous tree savannah with palms extending inland from the Coast
(Phoenix, Hyphaene or Borassus) MU 44.
None of the vegetation types described above are of conservation concern or warrant special
protection measures. All are widely and extensively distributed throughout the southern
African sub-region.
Climate and soil are the major determinants of variation in vegetation cover. Moving from
the coast inland, there is a decline in average rainfall and an increased prevalence of
xerophytic vegetation comprising mostly deciduous species. Deciduous Miombo tree
savannah and forest/savannah mosaics dominates on the older clayey and sandy soils of the
interior, Semi deciduous miombo dominates on the darker alluvial soils, while littoral thicket
and forest on recent dunes dominates on the more recent dunes and youngest sandy soils of
the coastal zone.
1.8.5    Muxungue to Inchope
The section of ENI between the Save River and Muxungue is excluded from this assessment.
Nevertheless this section of road warrants a brief description prior to describing the ENI
between Muxungue and Inchope.
58602 Annex E- ENI Road Projects   February 2001                              1-27



IMPAU'fO
The Save is a broad shallow river that is mainly dry during winter. It is lined by intact
riverine forest dominated by Syzygium guineense, Ficus sycamorus, Mimusops obtusifolia,
Trichelia emetica, Rauvolfia caffra, Diospyros mespiliformis and Kigelia africana. The lower
banks are protected by a dense growth of the shrub Grewia sulcata. Heading north the road
first traverses Coutada Five, which is characterised by extensive undisturbed tracts of
miombo and mopane woodland.
Between Muxungue and Inchope the vegetation is more disturbed and subsistence farming is
prevalent.
The ENI in this area traverses two vegetation types, deciduous miombo savanna woodland
(Brachystegia spiciformis - Julbernardia globiflora) (MU 23) and Deciduous dry miombo
(lowland) savanna woodland (MU 30).
Deciduous miombo savanna woodland (Brachystegia spiciformis - Julbemardia globiflora)
(MU 23) is very important on the plateaux of Manica and Sofala Provinces. In Manica and
Sofala Provinces it is found on altitudes of between 600 and 900m. It occurs on a great
variety of soils derived from, for example, granites, gneisses, Umkondo sandstones,
quartzites and schists and where rainfall varies between 700 and 1200mm p.a.
With Brachystegia spiciformis the commonest associated trees and shrub are Julbernardia
globiflora, Pterocarpus angolensis, Burkea africana, Swartzia madagascariensis, Parinari
curatellifolia, Diplorhynchus condylocarpon, Pericopsis angolensis, Annona senegalensis,
Amblygonocarpus andongensis, Terminalia sericea, Millettia stuhlmanii, Protea spp., etc.
In the areas bordering vleis or dambos there is savanna woodland of Brachystegia boehmii,
Julbernardia globiflora, Burkea fricana, Protea, Uapaca nitida, Maprounea africana, etc.
whilst in secondary areas Julbernardia globiflora, Entada abyssinica, Annona senegalensis,
Antidesma venosum, Dichrostachys cinerea subsp. nyassana, dominate.
Deciduous dry miombo (lowland) savanna woodland (MU 30) occurs in Manica and
Sofala Provinces where it occupies the northern slope of the valley of the Save River. Below
100m the Brachystegia boehmii-B. allenii-Julbernardia globiflora escarpment, savanna
woodlands give way to almost pure Julbernardia globiflora. This type occupies the lower
parts of the escarpment or the ridges in low altitude areas alternating with Colophospermum
mopane zones, Acacia zones or Combretum-Terminalia zones along drainage lines.
The grass cover is sparse, similar to that under Brachystegia spiciformis- Julbernardia
globiflora savanna woodland but Heteropogon contortus and species of Eragrostis and
Aristida become more common.  This is a distinctively drier type than any of the
Brachystegia woodlands or savanna woodlands. Where ridges are steeper or more broken
than usual, a low altitude ecotype of B. glaucescens with relatively few pairs of leaflets
becomes prevalent. This has been observed in the lowest parts of the escarpment of Manica
and Sofala.
1.8.6    Ecologically Sensitive Plant Communities
Within the southern coastal zone a number of habitats have biological and ecological
importance, namely:
58602 Annex E- ENI Road Projects   February 2001                            1-28



IMPAC'iO
u swamp forests;
Li riverine forests;
o wetlands, swamps and floodplains; and
o coastal dunes.
Of these plant communities, the ENI only runs adjacent to the wetlands, swamps and
floodplain community and is described below.
Seasonal flooding is an essential component of the natural function of these ecosystems. In
turn these habitats act as giant sponge that help to regulate the river. During the dry season
the decomposing vegetation results in very low oxygen concentration away from the
remaining channels and lagoons. With the flooding of the swamps (main rains fall between
November and March) the fishes disperse into the surrounding shallow swamps and
floodplains where breeding occurs. Not only the breeding system but also the feeding regime
is adapted to these seasonal events.
1.9 WILDLIFE HABITAT AND THREATENED FAUNA
1.9.1    Wildlife Habitat
i   Maputo to Xai Xai
There are very limited data about the conservation status of the fauna in this region.
Research has been fragmentary and more related to reserves and parks in other geographic
areas of the country. Historically the Inkomati River basin was an important wildlife habitat.
The current status of most species remains uncertain and many species are now probably
locally extinct.
ii   Xai Xai to Inhambane
Much of the woodland habitat has been converted to small-scale farms and associated cashew,
mango and coconut plantations. Consequently there is little or no suitable habitat for medium to
large size mammals. Suitable habitat (mainly secondary woodland) for small mammal species
such as suni (Neotragus moschatus), common duiker (Silvicapra grimmia), red duiker
(Cephalophus natalensis) and steenbok (Raphicerus campestris) is still found in some areas.
The intact littoral dune forest is characterized by high bird species diversity. In contrast, the
anthropogenic landscape of the interior dunes does not offer suitable habitat for fruit and seed
eating bird species accounting for the relatively low bird species diversity. Interestingly, low
aquatic bird species diversity was noted for the lakes of the region in contrast to the large
number of aquatic species recorded for the Limpopo Valley (south) and Lake Quissico
further north (Vincent Parker, pers. comm.).

IMPAL'IO
iii   Inhambane to the Save River
In the past, this region was rich in wildlife, and populations of large herbivorous mammals
such as elephant, buffalo, kudu, eland, and carnivores such as lion, leopard and cheetah
occurred throughout the region. The protracted armed conflict and lack of formal
conservation initiatives led to a decline, and in some cases, the local extinction of most
species of large mammals. Today the area's fauna consists mainly of small to medium-sized
herbivores, bats, rodents, and small carnivores. Fauna are more prevalent to the west of the
national road ENI (Arco 1998). On the basis of fieldwork done for the EIS of the exploration
drilling, Arco (1998) estimate that fourteen species of mammals of conservation concern
occur in the region.
The area is rich in avifauna; which is to be expected considering the diversity of habitat types
within the region. Over two days of preliminary fieldwork a total of 50 species of birds were
identified. A previous brief survey identified 102 species (MICOA, 1997). However, the
species richness is likely to be much higher. In contrast to the distribution of mammals,
species richness is probably higher in the eastern section, which includes the Govuro River, a
diversity of wetland habitats, and the coastal zone. Again, a significant number of bird
species are likely to be of conservation concern (nine species, according to Arco, 1998).
Relatively limited data exist concerning the lower vertebrates (reptiles, amphibians, and fish).
Nevertheless species diversity for all three taxa is expected to be high, and it is probable that
several species of conservation concern occur in the Concession Areas. Previous studies of
herpetofauna (Arco, 1998) reported the presence of 23 reptile and five amphibian species,
though both are probably substantial underestimates of true species richness. Many of these
species (especially amphibians and fish) will be dependent on the diversity of wetland
habitats that characterise the region.
iv    Muxungue to Inchope
Despite the close proximity of Coutada Five and the extensive tracts of intact savanna habitat
this region is no longer rich in wildlife resources. The same is true for Zinave National Park
which is situated on the south bank of the Save River approximately 50km to the west of the
road. Flagship species such as elephant, buffalo, hippo, numerous species of antelope, and the
big cats were once common in this region. Now their status is uncertain and many species
may in fact be locally extinct. Early faunal surveys (Smithers and Tello 1976; Smithers 1983)
recorded 104 mammal species in this region. Avian biodiversity is remarkably high and
probably unchanged, with a total of 424 species recorded for the region (Maclean, 1985).
1.9.2    Threatened Species
Along this section of the ENI road, most important wildlife areas are in close proximity to
the major river valleys (Inkomati, Limpopo, and Save).
i   Fish
There are ten fish species of conservation concern known to occur within the ENI project
roads ROI. A description of these species is provided in Appendix A (Table A2).

IMPAC'LU
ii   Amphibians
There is very little knowledge about the occurrence and conservation status of amphibians.
Frogs with a probable distribution along the major river basins and associated wetlands are
included in the Appendix A (Table A3).
iii   Reptiles
Fourteen species of reptiles of special conservation concern have been recorded for the
region, many of these species are inhabitants of the major river basins (Appendix A,
Table A4). There are only three species of known reptiles of vulnerable status, which occur
within the ENI project roads ROI, namely the Gabbon Adder, Nile Crocodile and South
African Rock Python.
iv    Birds
There is no Red Data Book for birds in Mozambique and only a few surveys on the
conservation status of birds have been produced during the last decade. Scarcity of game and
livestock limits foraging opportunities and, because of that, populations of species like the
Cape Vulture, and Lappetfaced Vulture are in decline in Mozambique.
Rare species such as the Saddlebilled Stork are sighted infrequently in their preferred wetland
habitats The decline is a result of hunting and human disturbance around wetlands. Other
declining populations include the Rufousbellied heron (Butorides rufiventris).
Rare non-breeding summer migrants like the Steppe Eagle (Aquila nipalensis) has been
recorded near Moamba.
Breeding resident populations of the uncommon Longcrested Eagle (Lophaetus occipitalis)
are in decline along river estuaries north of Maputo, due to pressure on the natural vegetation
and the reduction of wetlands.
The palmnut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis) has been recently observed breeding near
Manhica. Its preferred habitat is wetlands where the palms Raphia australis are present.
These are now restricted mainly to Bobole Reserve.
Vulnerable species only occurring in marshlands include the Pinkthroated longclaw
(Macronyx amelidae). However there are no actual records of the presence of previous
visitors and residents like the Chestnutbanded Plover (Charadrius pallidus), Whitecrowned
Plover (Vanellus albiceps), Dickinson's Kestrel (Falco dickinsoni), Thickbilled Cuckoo
(Pachycoccyx audeberti), Pel's Fishing Owl (Scotopelia peli), and Neergaard's Sunbird
(Nectarina neergardi).
The Lemonbreasted canary a near endemic species to Mozambique - is restricted to the areas
between Uanetze and Mazimechopes river, related to ilala palm (Hyphaene natalensis)
populations. The floodplains of the Inkomati River are considered by Phillip Clancey as the
natural frontier for two races of the vulnerable Rudd's Apalis, A.r. fumosa (south) and
A.r.ruddi (north)

IMPALIY)
A summarized list of birds of special conservation concern known to occur within the ENI
project roads ROI is presented in Appendix A (Table A5). Bird species with a relatively
restricted distribution are listed in Appendix A (Table A6).
v    Mammals
There are no recent surveys of terrestrial mammals in the area. Anecdotal data suggests the
presence of some mammals with special biological and ecological value. Truly riverine
mammals not included in the Red Data Book were also reported such as Water mongoose
(Atilax paludinosus), Cape clawless otter (Aonix capensis) and the reed dependent Cane rat
(Thryonomys swinderanus).
Hippopotamus were recorded until recently in the major rivers. However, their current status
remains uncertain.
A list of the mammals of special conservation concern whose presence has been informally
confirmed within the ROI is provided in Appendix A (Table A7).
1.10 CONSERVATION AREAS
1.10.1    National Parks and Reserves
No proclaimed conservation areas (National Parks, Games Reserves or Forest Reserves) are
located in the region through which the road passes.
The 110km section of the ENI from the Save River to Muxungue (which has not been
prioritised for rehabilitation during this phase of the project) bisects one of the country's
thirteen designated controlled hunting areas (Coutada number 5).
The stretch of road between Vilanculos and Inhassoro (Inhambane Province) is adjacent to
the Bazaruto National Park. This is renowned for the pristine beaches of the archipelago's
four islands and varied fauna, which includes protected and endangered species such as
marine mammals (whales, dolphins and dugongs), marine turtles and corals.
Bazaruto National Park (Parque Nacional de Bazaruto) was created in 1971 by the Diploma
Legislativo n 46 of the Decreto n 40.040/71 and it comprises Magaruque, Benguerua and
Bangue islands. Bazaruto Island is not currently included in the park boundaries. However,
the Conservation Master Plan for Sustainable Development of the Bazaruto Archipelago
(Dutton & Zolho, 1990 submitted to the Government (Ministry of Agriculture) in 1991
recommended the inclusion of Bazaruto Island in the Park.
Inchope, the northern limit of the road, is located to the south-east of the Gorongosa National
Park, one of the most important conservation areas in Mozambique. The Park is renowned for
the protection of wildlife although wildlife populations may range over a wide area and large
mammals may occur outside the GNP particularly along the Rift Valley and surrounding
woodlands. Tinley (1977) lists 46 large mammal species (>5 kg mass) for the Gorongosa area
Appendix A (Table A8). However, several of these species are locally extinct/near extinction
58602 Annex E- ENI Road Projects   February 2001                            1-32



IMPAC'LO
and examples include tsessebe (extinct), the roan antelope (locally extinct) and the black and
white rhino (probably extinct).
Conservation measures in the Park are being undertaken under a five-year project (GERFFA
- Gestao dos Recursos Florestais e Faunisticos) financed by the African Development Bank
(1997-2002). Under the Project, rehabilitation and long-term development is intended. New
Park headquarters are being constructed, internal access is being improved and law
enforcement strengthened. Additionally, tourism with private sector involvement is being
promoted. The wildlife training school will be re-established in the Park and community
relations are being developed and it is intended that benefits from the Park will accrue to
local communities.
1.10.2    Coastal Barrier Lakes
Coastal barrier lakes extend along the southern coastline of Mozambique from Ponta do Oura
to Inhassoro. Typical freshwater/brackish water fish species occur in these lakes with the
exception of Lake Bilene (south of Xai-Xai), which has a mixture of marine and brackish
water species. During a brief survey (Hatton, 1995) recorded 29 species occurring in selected
coastal lakes of southern Mozambique (Appendix A, Table A8). The apparent species
paucity of the Chidenguele lakes probably reflects the sampling method (generally only one
day's catch per lake by local fishermen). A more intensive sampling program employing
other techniques will undoubtedly reveal the presence of other species in the Chidenguele
lakes.
In an earlier study (Tello, 1973) listed 30 different freshwater and estuarine species occurring
in the coastal lakes of Maputo Special Reserve, south of Maputo City of which three species,
Croilia mossambica, Serranochromis meridianu, and Nothobranchius orthonothus are listed
as rare (the former two) and endangered (the latter) by the IUCN (Skelton, 1993). C.
mossambica and N. Orthonothus are considered to be near endemic to the region. However,
it is not known whether these species occur in the Chidenguele barrier lakes.
Little is known about the vertebrate and invertebrate fauna associated with these water
bodies.  The consensus of opinion is that biodiversity is high, notably avifauna and
herpetofauna. Historically, the mammal fauna was also rich and diverse especially wetland
specialists such as reedbuck, duiker, mongoose, genet and otter.
The lake systems occur in the depressions of the undulating dunes. North of Xai-Xai
miombo elements enter the transition e.g. Brachystegia spp., Pterocarpus angolensis
("umbila") and Tamarindus indica (MU 28). Along this stretch population density is high,
and small-scale farms with coconut, cashew and mango trees have replaced much of the
natural woodlands to small-scale farms through slash and burn, only the more important
indigenous fruit-bearing trees are left untouched for example, Garcinia livingstonei
("bimbe"), Strychnos spp. And Sclerocarya birrea. Large areas have been planted with
cashew (Anacardium occidentale) and mango trees (Mangifera indica).

IMPAC'W
1.10.3    Threatened Plant Species
To date relatively little is known about the conservation status of plant species in
Mozambique. Reference is made to Bandeira et al. (1994). A study prepared by Arco (1998)
for the Sasol exploration drilling at Temane identified 23 species of plants occurring in the
ROI that may be of conservation concern. These species are listed in Appendix A (Table Al).
1.11 NOISE AND AIR QUALITY
Noise levels along the ENI project road, except in settlements, are low and predominantly
generated by natural conditions (i.e. from insects, winds and rivers flows). Noise levels
seldom exceed low background levels, however in settlements, noise levels can be higher
during the day in market areas.
Ambient air quality in all of the proposed road areas is good due to a lack of industry and
allied urban activities. Haze is often observed due to the frequently practiced slash and burn
agriculture and production of charcoal. Levels of airborne dust generated by winds can also
be high passing over agricultural fields, and from smoke from forest and grassland fires.

2 SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
2.1 INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this section is to describe the socio-economic environment for seven sections
of the National Road 1 (EN1) from Manhica in Maputo Province to Inchope in Sofala
Province. The road passes through Southern Region and the southern section of Central
Region. Southern Region consists of Maputo, Gaza and Inhambane Provinces. Central
Region consists of Sofala, Manica and Tete Provinces. Information has been derived from
existing reports and publications where information is disaggregated usually at the Provincial
and District levels. Field visits were also made to each of the seven sections of road during
the month of November 2000.
The objective of this section is to describe the overall socio-economic context in terms of the
living conditions for the populations living in proximity to the ENI road. Where possible
statistical information has been provided to enable the establishment of base line data from
which the impacts of road improvement may be made.
The seven road sections are:
ROAD SECTIONS                           PROVINCE
Maputo - Manica                         Maputo

Muxungue - Inchope                      Sofala/Manica
2.2 PROVINCIAL SETTINGS AND ADMINISTRATIONS
2.2.1   Introduction
The seven sections of the ENI pass through four Provinces: Maputo, Gaza, Inhambane, and
Sofala. The section of the ENI Muxungue to Inchope passes briefly through Manica
Province.  For socio-economic description purposes information for Maputo, Gaza,
Inhambane and Sofala Provinces was used predominantly supplemented with broad indices
of information from Gondola District in Manica Province.
2.2.2    Traditional Administration
Administrative structures accord with the rest of Mozambique whereby each Province is
divided into Districts.  Each District is sub-divided for administrative purposes into
Administrative Posts and further sub-divided into Localities. Provinces are administered
through a Governor selected by the Mozambican president. At the provincial level there

IMPA 'IO
exists the extensions of the departments of government such as Ministries of agriculture,
education, and health. Policy is made at the central government level to be implemented by
the various Provincial ministries. The Governor performs the function of co-ordinator of the
various ministries. The Governor does not have the authority to select or replace a Provincial
head of a ministry. This authority is vested in the respective Ministers of government.
Traditional administrative structures exist in Southern and Central Regions of Mozambique
based upon the concept of a Chief or headperson of a community or ethnic grouping. This
traditional structure exists, too lesser or greater extent, in most localities side-by-side with the
more modem administrative apparatus of the State and political parties. In general terms the
first government of an independent Mozambique from 1975 attempted to replace the
inherited colonial and traditional systems with a centralised system based upon the political
doctrines of socialism. With political and economic reform since the mid-1980's the
intention of the Government has been to dismantle a highly centralised system and replace it
by devolving increasing amounts of decision making authority to Provincial and District
levels.
2.2.3    Population
The combined population of the four Provinces the ENI passes through is 4,281,028 as of the
national census conducted in 1997 and represents approximately 25 per cent of
Mozambique's total population (17,300,000). Gaza and Inhambane Provinces are relatively
sparsely populated at 14 and 16.3 persons per square kilometre respectively, below the
national average of 18 persons per square kilometre. Sofala Province at 18.9 persons per
kilometre is marginally above the national average. Maputo Province has the highest
population density at 30.9 persons per square kilometre, but below Nampula Province, which
has the highest population density in Mozambique at 36.2 persons per square kilometre. The
population figures and population densities for the four Provinces the road passes through are
provided in Table 4.
Table 4: Population
Province        Population      Pop. Density
(pop/km2)
Maputo              806,179*           30.9
Gaza                1,062,380          14.0
Inhambane           1,123,079          16.3
Sofala              1,289,390          18.9
Total               4,281,028     20.02 (average)
* Excludes Maputo City
Most of the population of the three Provinces (Maputo, Gaza, and Inhambane) in the
Southern Region is concentrated along the coast and the ENI. In general, this accords with
the more favourable agro-ecological conditions closer to the coast where rainfall and soil
fertility is higher and other opportunities for commercial activity are more possible. The
southern section of the ENI is the most heavily used section of road in Mozambique as it

country. This in itself provides an attraction as the communication channel offered by the
ENI affords other income generating opportunities.
Population characteristics accord with general profile for Mozambique as a whole. The
population structure is young (approximately 35 percent of Mozambican's are under the age
of 30 years of age). Average age structures are 0-14 years constituting 46% of the population
(male 4,141,915 and female 4,115,191), 15-64 years constituting 51% of the population
(male 4,324,102 and 4,868,518 female, and 65 years and over 3% of the population (male
184,606 and 243,595 female). Household sizes are large at 5.5 members, and the ratio
between economically active and passive members (less than 15 years or more than 60 years)
of the population is high with a dependency ratio of 1:1. These figures are presented in Table
5.

2.2.4    Ethnicity
The main ethnic groups in the south are the Tsonga in the southern lowlands, and the Chopi
and Tonga along the coast and are the largest group in Inhambane Province. Mozambicans
have been mixing with different cultures for centuries and have absorbed many different
characteristics and customs. Arabs had been trading and living along the coast for hundreds
of years before the arrival of the Portuguese, and when the new colonisers came they quickly
settled and intermarried, creating a rich cultural mix. Mozambicans today reflect that
melding or races.
The diversity of population is reflected in the variety of languages spoken. The official
language is Portuguese although approximately 10 percent only of Mozambicans speak it as
their first fanguage. The main language along the ENI section in Inhambane Province is
Tsonga.  Further west and particularly in Gaza Province the Changane language
predominates.
2.2.5    Gender
The ethnic groups present in the Southern Region of Mozambique are patrilineal where
inheritance is from father to son. Although most ethnic groups are patrilineal, the prevalence
of male migration necessitates that in many rural areas particularly in the Southern Region of
Mozambique, women run their families and livings. FRELIMO as part of the liberation
struggle promoted concepts related to the equality of women. With independence in 1975
these progressive attitudes towards the role of women continued including the introduction of
new laws, which attempted to enshrine protection of rights for women.
Despite the advancement of the rights of women under independent administration,
Mozambican girls and women do less well than boys and men. Maternal mortality rate is

IMPAL"1U
high at 1,100 per 100,000. Access to health services directed specifically at women is
generally very poor. Literacy rates for women are much lower than for men. Family law in
Mozambique still discriminates against women. A married woman has limited rights to make
independent economic decisions or enjoy full ownership of assets, and a widow's rights to
inheritance are secondary to males in the family. Girls in rural areas in general marry young
often as soon as they reach puberty.
2.2.6    Economy
Mozambique has undergone a period of significant economic recovery since the signing of
the peace accord in 1992. Annual growth rate as defined by gross domestic product (GDP) in
the past three years has been calculated at 8.8, 9.7 and 7.3 percent, respectively. Inflation has
fallen from a level of almost 50 percent in 1996 to a current level of less than 6% per annum.
Foreign investment into Mozambique has grown rapidly since the signing of the peace
accords in 1992. In the seven years 1993-1999, $4.2 billion in foreign investments were
approved, $1.2 billion in foreign direct investment and $3 billion in loans. Implementation
has been slower with only $284 million actually spent in 1998 ($213 million in investment
and $81 million in private sector credit).  The majority of foreign investment into
Mozambique has been largely orientated to the Southern Region and in particular Maputo
City and Maputo Province. For example, in Maputo City during 1999, work started on the
$1.3 billion Mozal aluminium smelter, by far Mozambique's largest investment project, and
was commissioned in September 2000. In large part due to Mozal, 1999 saw $348 million in
actual foreign direct investment and $495 million in foreign loans to the private sector.
Mozal alone is believed to account for more than 2 percent of the 7.3 percent per capita GDP
growth rate for 1999, leading to fears that growth is increasingly reliant on large projects.
Maputo, Gaza and to a lesser extent Inhambane Provinces benefit from their proximity to
South Africa, Mozambique's largest trading partner and biggest foreign investor. The
presence of a relatively large and strong economy affords several opportunities to
Mozambique. Maputo City provides port facilities for the exportation and importation of
goods for South Africa. The Southern Region and to a lesser extent Central Region of
Mozambique was historically a major holiday destination for South Africans. With the return
of peace and stability to Mozambique South African tourists have returned in increasing
numbers to Mozambique.
Despite the concentration of much of Mozambique's industrial capacity in the Southern
Region and in particular in and around Maputo City, the economy and households of the
Southern Region are still dependent upon subsistent agriculture. The floods of early 2000
badly affected agricultural production. The infrastructure of the Southern Region and in
particular roads and bridges were badly damaged as a result of the floods. The Government
of Mozambique managed to secure approximately $450 million of emergency funds from
international donors to address the repair and reconstruction of infrastructure. The damage to
sections of the EN I was severe, but emergency repairs enabled the reopening of the road.
2.2.7    Poverty
According to the National Poverty Assessment (1996-97) 68.1 % of the population are
categorized as poor corresponding to 2.1 million people. The poverty figures for Gaza and
58602 Annex E- ENI Road Projects  February 2001                            2-4



IMPAL 'i
Inhambane Provinces are 80% and 64.7% respectively. Life expectancy is similar in Gaza
and Inhambane as for the rest of Mozambique (37 years). More than 90% of the population
depend on agriculture, forestry and fisheries for their livelihood, mostly comprising the
family sector. There are few formal sector employment opportunities. The number of people
who have had any formal education is low and the situation is particularly acute with regards
to the numbers of persons who have attained any formn of higher-level training.
2.2.8    Political Environment
In the 1999 elections the ruling political party FRELIMO received the majority of the votes
cast in Maputo, Inhambane and Gaza Province. Gaza Province is the birthplace of Joaquim
Chissano the current president of Mozambique. The first president of Mozambique Samora
Machel was also born in Gaza Province. This historical lineage adds to Gaza Province strong
political allegiance to FRELIMO. In Sofala Province the 1999 elections the popular vote was
unanimously for RENAMO the main opposition political party. Sofala Province was the
political stronghold for Mozambique during the armed conflict of the 1980's. Political
tension exists to the extent that RENAMO believe they should be allowed to select a
candidate as Governor of the Province to reflect their electoral superiority. The issue of the
political allegiance of the Governor is currently vigorously debated in Mozambique.
2.2.9    Education
Demand on education facilities is extremely high in all four Provinces the road passes
through. This reflects the young age of the population (on average 46% of the population in
Mozambique is between 0 and 14 years old) and the interest families have to send their
children to school. Table 6 shows education provision for Maputo, Gaza, Inhambane and
Sofala Provinces.

Primary education provision in terms of the ratio between children and schools is best in
Gaza Province (one primary (EPI) school per 975 children between the ages of 0 and 14
years old). The worst served is Sofala Province with one primary (EPI) school per 1,957
children between the ages of 0 and 14 years. Table 7 gives comparisons for the four
provinces in terms of the ratio of children to primary (EP1) school provision.

2.2.10     Health
The illnesses occurring most frequently in the Southern Region and Central Region are
malaria, tuberculosis, bilharzia, intestinal parasites, acute respiratory infection, AIDS,
sexually transmitted diseases and non-specific diarrhoea. Current rates of HIV infection for
Southern Region are on average 23% and are projected to rise to 27% by the year 2010. It is
calculated that 50% children under five-years suffer from chronic malnutrition and 10% from
acute malnutrition.
2.2.11     Access To Services
Since 1992 the pace of redevelopment of services and infrastructure has been dramatic.
Despite the progress made, post-war reconstruction has still not been completed.
Infrastructure remains generally poor. Floods, such as those that occurred in the Southern
Region and to a lesser extent in Central Region of Mozambique in February and March 2000,
set farmers, fishermen and other small businesses back many years.  Many believe
Mozambique will continue to need high levels of international assistance to complete
reconstruction, and to build a more robust base for the kind of development that is essential
to ending acute poverty.

Access to services for the rural population is generally poor. Most villages on average do
have a primary school (EPI), but in general the condition of these schools could be
categorized as rudimentary and often availability of teachers is very low. Less the 2% of
villages in Southern Region has a secondary school. Most villages have access to a basic
health centre, but only access to a trained doctor is very low. Dependence on traditional
healers is the norm for the vast majority of the population and almost every village would
have at least one person categorised as a traditional healer. Table 8 gives the availability of
services by Province for Maputo, Gaza, Inhambane, and Sofala Provinces.
2.2.12    Livelihood Strategies
The principle economic activity in the four Provinces is agriculture. Most food production is
within the family sector upon which the majority of the population is dependent. The
principle food crops grown are cassava (total production for Maputo, Gaza, Inhambane and
Sofala Provinces 500,271 tons/metric for 1999/200) and maize (total production for Maputo,
Gaza, Inhambane and Sofala Provinces 241,653 tons/metric 1999/2000). The main crops
grown and production levels (tons/metric) for Maputo, Gaza, Inhambane and Sofala
Provinces are shown in Table 9.

2.3 DISTRICT CHARACTERISTICS
2.3.1    District Settings and Administration
This section describes socio-economic factors specific to the Maputo to Inchope ENI road.
The main sources of information relate to existing written reports concerning the Districts the
ENI passes through. This was supplemented with information collected during a brief field
visit along the ENI during November 2000.
The EN I passes through eleven Districts as indicated in Table 10.
The public administration structures for the eleven Districts include Administrative Posts,
District Government Directorates and a range of public institutions. The provision of public
administration services differs markedly between the Districts, depending on the District.

2.3.2    Traditional Administration
Traditional structures exist in all eleven Districts, and these complement the formal
administration. The chiefs and headman of tribes have authority at local and village levels but
the level of integration of this authority into District governance varies between Districts.
The major factor underpinning the problem of integration is the lack of a legal framework
linking administrative structures to traditional authorities.
The District Administrators and ward secretaries govern land allocation in the Districts. Land
may not be sold, but trees, buildings and other infrastructure may be traded. Apart from the
license fee, no payment is required to acquire land, and land rights are passed on to sons
through inheritance.
The administration of the eleven Districts occurs through both formal structures and
traditional structures. Traditional structures have authority only at local and village level. At
District level, the greater the perceived administrative needs of the District, the higher the
proportion of administration services provided. The major determinant of "perceived need"
appears to be population density.
2.3.3    Population
The combined population for the eleven Districts is 1,070,000. The most populated District
is Massinga (169,000 inhabitants).  The least populated District is Govuro (29,000
inhabitants). The average family size is 4.9 persons. The largest mean family size is found
in Zavala District (5.6) and the smallest mean family sizes are found in Massinga, Govuro
and Inhassoro Districts (4.2). The average population density for the eleven districts is 40.6
inhabitants per square kilometre. The highest population density is found in Zavala District
(89  inhabitants/Kmi2) and  the  lowest population  density  in  Govuro  District (6
inhabitants/kM2). A summary of the population statistics for the eleven Districts is provided
in Table 11.
2.3.4    Ethnicity
The main ethnic groups in the Southern Region of Mozambique are the Tsonga in the
southern lowlands, and the Chopi and Tonga along the coast.

2.3.5    Gender
The ethnic groups present in the Southern Region of Mozambique and within the eleven
Districts the sections of the EN1 passes through are patrilineal where inheritance is from
father to son. Although the ethnic groups are patrilineal, the prevalence of male migration
necessitates that in many rural areas particularly in the Southern Region of Mozambique,
women run their families and livings. FRELIMO as part of the liberation struggle promoted
concepts related to the equality of women. With independence in 1975 these progressive
attitudes towards the role of women continued including the introduction of new laws, which
attempted to enshrine protection of rights for women.
2.3.6    Economy
The economies of the Districts the ENI passes through are dependent upon small-scale
agriculture. Historically households in the Southern Region of Mozambique have been
dependent on remittances sent back from migrant labourers, mostly men working on the
mines in South Africa. Although the numbers of Mozambican migrant miners has during the
last decade reduced considerably, the culture of young men wanting to leave their home
village is strong. These migratory patterns have effects on household economies of families
living along or in proximity to the ENI. The most obvious one is the loss of young male
workers and their contribution to the subsistence agricultural activities of households. This

IMPA 'LW
loss is balanced to a certain extent with the remittances men may send back to their families
and the fact that there is one less mouth to feed at home.
The economy of the Southern Region and in particular Maputo Province has benefited most
from the rapid economic growth that Mozambique has enjoyed over the last five years. The
impacts of this overall economic growth are more difficult to determine at the District level.
There have been tangible benefits to improvements in infrastructure such as schools, health
facilities, and roads. It is more difficult to determine if household incomes are increasing.
Overall gross domestic product for the Southern Region is going up and is currently at
approximately $220 a year per head. It is however probable that for the majority of
households in Southern Region there has been no significant increase in household incomes
during the last five years despite strong national and regional economic growth.
The floods of 2000 had a negative impact on rural household well being in particularly in the
Gaza and Inhambane Provinces. The ENI road was under water along several sections,
which also affected family agricultural output. Families most affected by the floods lost on
average between one-third and one-half of all crop production. This overall situation to an
extent disguises the fact that for some families, perhaps as much as 20% of all households in
Gaza Province, lost all their crops. There is obvious concern that a failure in crop production
for the growing season 2000 to 2001 could prove catastrophic for families still only just
recovering from the floods of 2000.
Table 12 presents for the eleven districts the ENI road passes through a qualitative
comparison of a number of economic and service indices. It is presented as an indication of
development in the eleven Districts.

2.3.7     Poverty
The main period of poor nutrition is the period between October and March when crop stores
are at their lowest and before the new season harvest. The principal deficiencies in dietary
terms for the Districts the ENI passes through are lack of vitamin A and iron leading to a
high incidence of anaemia. There is a problem particularly in the Districts situated in

Inhambane Province (e.g.. Inharrine, Zavala, Jangamo, Homoine, and Morrumbene) related
to intoxication due to the poor preparation of cassava mainly causing problems of vomiting.
Using a variety of written material but specifically the Perfil Distrital de Segran a Alimentar
e NutriVao (1999) it is possible to describe the general socio-economic characteristics of
families living along the ENI in terms of indicators of poverty or well-being. Table 13
presents a summary of socio-economic characteristics.  Categorizing families in terms of
poor, medium, and rich, surveys indicate that within the Districts the ENI passes through
over 50 to 60% of families are poor, 30 to 40% medium, and 0% to 10% rich.

2.3.8     Political Environment
The Southern Region of Mozambique supported the ruling political party FRELIMO at the
last general election in 2000. The policies of the current Government have included attempts
to devolve more responsibility and authority to the Provincial level. The general capacity of
Provincial Government departments is weak. The current problems relate to the capacity of
Provincial and District levels of Government to adequately deliver services to their
populations. These problems are recognised and projects, which concentrate on capacity
building, are encouraged. However, while capacity is in the process of being built there is
some political tensions between the Provincial and Central levels of Government as lines of
responsibility and authority are being clarified.

In general the provision of primary (EPI) schools in Southern Region is better than in the
Central and Northern Regions of Mozambique. While most villages in the Districts along the

still very poor. Table 14 summarises education provision in the eleven districts the ENI road

2.3.10    Health
Most villages in the Districts the ENI passes through have available basic health facilities in
the form of a health post. These health posts are able only to administer basic health
provision to their local populations. The level of training of staff at health posts is minimal
and often consists of having completed only a basic first aid course. Health Centres have
greater provision and more qualified staff usually to the level of nurse. Only one of the
Districts (Manhica) has available a rural hospital with a qualified doctor.  Table 15
summarises the availability of health facilities within the districts the EN I passes through.
2.3.11     Access to Services
The people living along the ENI and in close proximity to it generally have good access to a
variety of facilities. As Mozambique's main road, local populations can travel along the road
using the available public transport to access the services they require.

2.3.12    Livelihood Strategies
Rural production predominates throughout the study area. The main food crops include
maize, cassava, groundnuts, sorghum, beans, sweet potato and vegetables.  Fruit is an
important dietary supplement throughout the region. Wildlife is still present and game meat
is an important food source to the populations of these Districts. Use is also made of the
availability of wood for firewood, building materials and charcoal production and this has led
to deforestation and erosion.  Livestock farming is very limited.  The extent of the
agricultural activity is dependent upon several factors, notably:
o  fertility of the soil;
o  availability of water;
o  availability of good pasture;
o  availability of supportive transportation linkages to facilitate trade;
o  availability of communication linkages to facilitate trade;
o  population densities;
o  availability of social services and amenities to support the population; and
o  availability of supportive formal financial and credit institutions.
Table 16 lists the main crops produced, production in tons, and tons per hectare for the
growing season 1999 to 2000 for the eleven Districts the ENI passes through.
2.3.13    General Characteristics of Families within the District
A day for a typical family living along the Maputo to Inchope ENI road would involve
women working in the machambas. Men participate to some extent in the day-to-day
activities of the machambas, but this is normally confined to clearing of land and house
maintenance. In the house women will look after the children, cook, clean the house, and
would be involved in most daily household activities. Men are responsible for construction
and maintenance of the house.

IMPA C'f()
The period of most work is between November and February, the main period of cultivation
and harvest. Women will control the household stocks of food while men will be responsible
for expenditure related to the children. The land cultivated will belong to the married couple.
In the case of the death of a spouse or divorce the belongings will be divided between the
wife and the family of the husband. Women of these areas will likely have more
responsibilities in terms of the day-to-day management of households due to the relatively
high levels of male migration.

2.3.14    Archaeological and Cultural Sites
The Maputo to Inchope ENI already exists and in comparison to other roads in Mozambique
is in good condition. The road passes through no known archaeological or cultural sites.
Any planning for major extension to the road in terms of width or realignment should involve
consulting the appropriate Chefe de Poste (Chief of Post) to determine if any local cultural
sites, most probably cemeteries, are likely to be disturbed.

IMPACT 0
3 POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
3.1 IDENTIFICATION
This section provides an assessment of the potential environmental impacts associated with the
rehabilitation of the EN1 from Maputo to the Save River and from Muxungue to Inchope.
Environmental factors considered were:
o  land use change;
o  erosion and sedimentation;
o  water quality;
o  hydrology;
o  noise and vibration;
Li air quality;
o3 biological effects; and
o  socio-economic effects.
Each of these issues is addressed in sections covering the physical, biological and socio-
economic environments.
The majority of direct environmental impacts will be minor due to the limited extent of works
at any one site and the incorporation of impact mitigation measures into the improvement
works. The ENI currently has a sufficient and well defined road corridor which is identified
by ANE as 15m either side of the road centreline (Pieter Van Niekerk, pers. comm., ANE,
November 2000).
Indirect effects, may result from increased natural resource use due to increased local
enterprise activity to service increased traffic. These impacts are anticipated to be relatively
minor due to the fact that the road is already well established as the major north-south access
route in southern and central Mozambique.
Many of the potential environmental impacts associated with the construction of a new road do
not occur to the same degree when a road is improved within the existing road corridor. The
most likely impacts include:
oi altered land use patterns due to improved accessibility, such as a change from forestry to
agriculture, or from agriculture to industry (Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997);
o  public health problems, particularly through the spread of communicable disease (Birley,
1997); and
oi increased illegal logging and poaching activities due to improved access into forest areas
(Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997).

IMPA C'U
3.2 PHYSICAL EFFECTS
3.2.1    Land Use
i   Construction
The proposed road improvement works will not require a significant change to the land use
within the road corridor. Limited road improvement works will be undertaken and no road
realignments or clearances for improved visibility are anticipated. For the majority of its
length, there is no encroachment of cultivated land, woodland or settlements within the
existing corridor. However, it was observed that the road width and area cleared for the road
corridor is narrower along the Muxungue to Inchope section of the road than elsewhere along
the corridor.
The scope of road improvements is limited to the widening of the existing road formation and
the clearance of a range of land uses within the road corridor, including cultivated land, fallow
agricultural land, woodland and some grassland. In the towns and villages roadside stalls
('bancas'), and small bars ('barracas') are currently situated at distances of at least lOm from
the existing road centreline. There is generally no encroachment of village settlements along
the ENI with properties typically situated at distances in excess of 12m from the centre line.
Resettlement will not be a mitigation requirement.
Construction of additional roadside drains will be required particularly in areas where
gradients are steep, and also adjacent to villages.
The construction and installation of culverts are already underway along the ENI north of
Maxixe and south of the Vilanculos turnoff. Associated activities have been established as part
of these of current works such as the establishment of batching plants, work depots and
workforce camps, and the excavation of borrow pits.
Large borrow pits are frequently located close to the road corridor, generally within 1 5-20m of
the road edge. Where possible these existing borrow areas will be utilised during the road
works to avoid additional disturbance. The rehabilitation of these sites after completion of the
works will be undertaken through revegetation and levelling the landform to its original
condition. Where new borrow pits are established these will be located at least lOOm from the
road in accordance with current ANE guidelines.
A range of temporary ancillary activities will be required during the construction works but
will affect relatively small land areas. These sites will be rehabilitated upon completion of
activities.
ii   Land Use Change
Total land acquisition will be minimal relative to the project corridor length. Temporary areas
of land use change will occur at batching plant sites, borrow pits areas and workforce
campsites.
58602 Annex E- ENI Road Projects     February 2001                                3-2



IMPAL1'U
The road improvement works will have a negligible indirect effect on adjacent land use
activities, but may result in the establishment of additional roadside services, such as Barracas
(roadside diners) and resting places, to service the additional traffic. The number of new
services is likely to be minor as the projected traffic increase for the road is within historic
growth rates.
The existing borrow areas are clearly visible scars on the landscape and reflect a number of
environmental problems. Steep grades and inappropriate land forming affects their future use
potential and creates a safety hazard to local people and wildlife. Specific problems include:
o soil instability;
o land degradation;
o inhibited re-establishment of native vegetation and limited suitability of land for
cultivation;
o inability to replace topsoil for revegetation; and
o ponding of water through lack of drainage which promotes insect vector diseases.
iii    Mitigation Measures
Rehabilitation and land forming of existing borrow pit sites will result in an environmental
improvement, as rehabilitation will be designed to mitigate these issues.
Mitigation measures for other temporary facilities include:
o measures identified under socio-economics for selection and negotiation of use; and
o rehabilitation of all sites to their original condition, or better, to allow resumption of prior
land use.
3.2.2    Erosion and Sedimentation
i   Erosion Hazard
The dynamic interplay of several key factors dictates the degree of susceptibility to water-
driven soil erosion processes. These are:
o seasonality and intensity of rainfall in relation to water run-off;
o landscape topography in relation slope gradients;
o soil profile parameters, notably depth and binding properties;
o degree of vegetation cover; and
o magnitude and frequency of seismic events.
For road works in general, where the capacity of existing drainage works to manage water run-
off is exceeded then the interaction of the above factors will determine the extent and
magnitude of erosion processes. These considerations provide the basis to determine the
overall erosion hazard. The erosion risk will generally be low along the majority of the ENI
because the terrain is predominantly flat to undulating. Localised erosion can occur where

IMPA CL'O
sandy soils are left exposed. This is commonly observed on steep un-rehabilitated borrow pit
batters borrow pit batters where gully or rill erosion is evident. Similar problems can occur on
fill batters or other sloped areas.
The climate along the total stretch of the ENI is broadly comparable and typical of
Mozambique with rainfall patterns showing 80% of the rainfall recorded between November
and March. The erosion risk will be highest during this period.
The only section of the road that has a high frequency of seismic activity is between
Muxungue and Inchope. This section of the ENI falls within the zone of high seismic activity
which extends from the Rift Valley (Refer to Annexure C). The erosion risk along this section
is not exacerbated by the seismic potential as the road is located in rolling terrain and does not
cross valley sides or steep slopes which may be susceptible to seismic induced instability.
The ENI between Maputo and Inchope traverses a range of soil types. Main soil types include
alluvial deposits, sedimentary soils, volcanic rock and pre-Cambrian soils following
predominantly flat to undulating terrain gradually inclining as it approaches Inchope. The
greatest slopes traversed along the ENI road projects are up to 6%, occurring north of the
Limpopo River along the section between Xai Xai to Inhambane where the terrain is
characterised by rolling hills.
The overall erosion risk is low and is determined by a combination of deep to moderately deep
soils together with gentle slopes of less than 6%.
ii   Sedimentation Risk
Sedimentation is a secondary process of erosion and can be exacerbated by road works due to:
u deliberate and unanticipated modifications to surface and ground water hydrology;
o incomplete rehabilitation of roadside verge areas; and
o road rehabilitation through naturally hilly terrain.
Ground disturbance and the temporary stockpiling of materials during road works can trigger
uncontrolled and or accelerated sedimentation processes. The onset of this process will be
coincident with ground disturbance and will continue up until sites have been stabilised in the
road works zone. The extent of ground disturbance and clearing along the road corridor will
be marginal, with an average width of 16m disturbed during the construction stage.
Other areas where ground disturbance and clearing is required during the construction stage is
at stockpile areas, borrow pit sites, construction camps, and work compounds. The fill
required for the road works will be obtained from existing borrow sites or degraded areas
where possible to minimise the need for additional ground disturbance.
Borrow pits located along the side of the road are a common sight and are a source of scars on
the landscape. Some are located as close as 15m to the road edge and have not been
rehabilitated. Some are very large deep and have been left with steep slopes which are in most
cases almost vertical. The lack of levelling and topsoiling of these areas has prevented the
recovery of natural revegetation and the steep gradients and depth of the pits provides a safety
hazard to the local communities and fauna and are also at risk from erosion.

IMPAL 7U
The risk of uncontrolled sedimentation can also be exacerbated when the road traverses
wetlands and other surface water bodies. Sedimentation problems may occur during times of
heavy rain where the road becomes submerged due to back water flow from water courses and
drainage lines.
iii    Mitigation Measures
The provision of culverts along the road will improve cross-road drainage, reducing
sedimentation effects and scouring within drainage lines. This in turn will improve the
stability of road embankments and minimise sedimentation to the waterways.
Minor reconditioning of the existing culverts will be undertaken where their discharge is
causing downstream erosion. Specific measures for erosion and sediment control include:
o  design of drainage works to ensure these collect from and discharge to natural drainage
lines. This may not always be possible for mitre drains and in those situations frequent,
low volume drains are preferred;
Li provision of energy dissipation devices where discharge velocities and flows will erode
downstream drainage lines;
o  minimisation of disturbed areas;
o  design and construction of erosion and sedimentation controls such as diversion banks,
filter structures (filter fences or windrowed vegetation) and sediment traps;
o  diversion of significant upstream flows around working areas; and
o3 undertaking progressive rehabilitation and revegetation of all slopes and disturbed areas.
In addition, temporary erosion control drains will be installed prior to the wet season and no
new road excavation will be commenced during the wet season.
There are no significant slopes that the ENI intersects for the length of the project and no
significant erosion stabilisation measures, such as retaining walls will be required on road fill
or cut areas.
Establishment of vegetation will be undertaken to prevent localised rill erosion on slopes such
as batters and roadside embankments. Stone pitching may be required near culverts and
bridges where the embankments of the road approaches are steeper than a 1:2 grade.
The project provides an opportunity to undertake the planting of trees for soil conservation
purposes along the road corridor and within existing degraded areas, particularly gullies,
barren terrain, rivers and at borrow pit sites.
Vegetated embankments will minimise the effects of sedimentation during times of inundation.
The road rehabilitation works are likely to minimise erosion and sedimentation effects to the
rivers and streams with the implementation of roadside drainage and construction of culverts.

3.2.3    Water Quality
i   Construction
Sedimentation and resultant water quality effects were discussed in the previous section. This
section looks at other water quality issues.
Hydrocarbons from used lubricants sourced from improper disposal facilities and poor
operation and maintenance practices for construction vehicles and machinery can contaminate
surface waters. Improper disposal of oil filters and other materials from vehicle and machinery
maintenance can also cause pollution. This can occur during both construction and road
operation, but mostly during the former.
Spilled petroleum fuel, as well as bitumen and explosives residue, also have a potential to
contribute to the pollution of water bodies, but to a very minor extent.
Improper sanitation and waste disposal procedures in temporary construction camps can also
contaminate water resources.
ii    Operation
Borrow areas have the potential to result in adverse environmental impacts if they are not
rehabilitated correctly. If left in poor condition water can collect in the depressions created
and become weed infested as well as providing optimal breeding conditions for insect vectors
of parasitic diseases such as malaria.
iii    Mitigation Measures
All fuels, lubricants and bitumen will be stored in bunded areas. Vehicle maintenance and
refuelling will be confined to areas in construction camps designed to confine lubricants and
fuel spillages.
Adequate waste disposal and sanitation facilities will be provided at construction camps. Any
waste water or stormwater discharged from the site shall comply with the following objectives:
o  PH range                         6.0-9.0;
u  Total Suspended Solids (TSS)    <50mg/l;
o  Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)    <1500mg/l; and
o  Oils and surfactants            No visible film of oils or petrochemicals.
The Contractor shall ensure that all bitumen and fuel storage areas shall be bunded to contain
at least 120% of the maximum capacity of the largest storage tank. The floor of the bunded
area shall be impervious, and storage facilities and bunds shall be inspected weekly for spills.

IMPACf'U
3.2.4    Hydrology
i   Construction
The road works will have a negligible impact to hydrology as the rehabilitation works will be
undertaken along an existing alignment. The main construction activity that has the potential
to impede flows will be the stockpiling of materials near drainage lines and wetland areas.
ii   Operation
The road crosses several major rivers and small stream crossings as discussed earlier. The
road is an existing feature, and culverts have already been installed along major watercourses
and have been reassessed as part of the emergency works after last year's major floods. The
provision of culverts along the road have been determined for engineering purposes as a
measure for protecting the road structure and they are therefore not within the scope of this
study.
The adequate provision of culverts along wetland areas is a concern for maintaining the
ecological regime, particularly near Macia and towards Vilanculos. This issue is discussed
later in this Chapter.
iii   Mitigation Measures
Particular attention shall be given to stockpiling materials away from existing drainage lines
and wetland areas to minimise sedimentation.
All designed drainage works shall be installed at the time of initial road construction to ensure
that flows along drainage lines are not impeded.
New or rehabilitated culverts shall be laid in a direction, which is close to the natural position
of the drainage flow. This will avoid altering the channel flow and prevent upstream and
downstream scouring of the watercourse.
3.2.5    Noise and Vibration
i   Construction
Some sensitive receptors, such as schools and hospitals, are located within 5-lOm of the ENI
road corridor. Additional noise will be generated along the ENI road corridors and at ancillary
sites during the construction period, particularly from the increased number of heavy vehicles.
Vibration effects will be negligible due to the generally sandy soil substrate. Peak noise levels
generated by construction activities are expected to be greater than the peak noise levels from
road operation.
Construction noise is generally intermittent and depends on the type of operation, location and
function of the equipment and the equipment use cycle. Noise attenuates quickly over

IMPAC'TO
distance. Excavation noise levels, for example, assuming bulldozer and dump truck activity,
yield a level of approximately 85 dBA at 15m, but decrease by about 3-4 dBA with each
doubling of the setback distance, and would be reduced to approximately 70 dBA at about
240m.
Noise levels during the operation of the improved ENI road projects will increase due to an
increase in traffic and vehicle speeds.
ii   Operation
Accessibility will be improved following the road works but improvements are not expected to
generate additional traffic. Traffic growth is expected to be similar to historic growth. Noise
levels from traffic will not be increased as a result of the project.
The improved road design will allow an increase in vehicle speed and some increase in the
overall noise level is likely to result. When traffic speed doubles, this results in a 6 dB(A)
increase in noise level (Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997). The majority of the ENI road projects
traverse open cultivation land and wetland areas, the impact from an increase in noise levels
from increased traffic speed will be minimal.
The road works may reduce existing noise levels in built-up areas as a result of improved road
surface. This will reduce noise levels through the more efficient operation of vehicles and less
noise from vehicle tyres.
As ambient noise levels are generally lowest at night, the impact from traffic noise is expected
to be greater during these,hours.
iii   Mitigation Measures
No national noise level standards exist for highway construction equipment, however the
World Bank recommends the use of construction equipment, which meets international
standards.
The following measures shall be implemented to minimise the impact of noise during the
construction phase:
Ei work compounds shall be located at least 0.5km from settlements;
Li construction shall not occur between 19:00 and 06:00 hours at sites within 150m of
residential areas; and
Li maintenance of machinery and vehicles shall be undertaken and repaired regularly to keep
noise at a minimum.

IMPAC'WU
3.2.6    Air Quality
i      Construction
The deterioration in air quality from dust generation and vehicle emissions during road
construction will be a relatively minor environmental impact. Significant adverse effects are
not expected because of the limited duration of construction at any one site and the few
receptors. Most of the work will occur in open, cultivated areas.
A deterioration in air quality during road construction will primarily occur from dust generated
by road excavation, spoil transportation and disposal. In addition, most construction activities
will progressively move along the alignment, so prolonged deterioration in air quality will not
occur at any one site. The minor volumes of dust generated will cause a short-term localised
problem through settlements. Road construction workers will be exposed to minor dust
emissions over the construction period, with the quantity of dust partly dependent upon wind
conditions.
Exhaust emissions from traffic utilising the rehabilitated road will be minor due to a low
expected traffic growth (refer to Part B).
ii     Operation
Existing air quality is good and no significant air quality effects are expected during operation.
Traffic volumes are low and the road generally traverses rural areas.
iii    Mitigation
Mitigation measures will be implemented in areas where air quality problems would arise due
to construction activities. Areas of concern for dust control are in settlements and close to
sensitive sites such as schools and hospitals.
Minimising air emissions is particularly important during the construction stage, for activities
such as the operation of borrow pits and in-situ mixing of cement and sand, which have a
potential to generate high dust levels.
During the construction period, the following mitigation measures to suppress dust will be
implemented:
Li Water will be sprayed during the construction period at earth mixing sites, asphalt-mixing
sites, and on cleared surfaces. Water spraying will be undertaken during periods of high
wind, or when necessary, to suppress dust.
c  Operations shall be suspended during periods of dry windy weather, in areas where wind
blown dust is causing a nuisance in settlements or towns.
u  All equipment and plant machinery shall not emit visible smoke for a continuous period of
greater than 10 seconds.

IMPAL'i(
o All exhaust systems and engines on plant and equipment shall be in accordance with the
manufacturers specifications and kept well maintained to ensure that they have a high level
operating efficiency.
3.3 BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS
3.3.1    Direct Impacts
Vegetation will need to be cleared to undertake the road rehabilitation works and enable road
formation widening and construction of additional drainage. The conservation value of the
road corridor vegetation that will be cleared is not high. The woodland areas crossed by the
road corridor are highly utilised, particularly for slash and burn agriculture, which has been
undertaken adjacent to the ENI road projects. The amount of clearing that will need to be
undertaken will be minimal as the road corridor is well defined for the majority of its length.
The impact of any clearing required for the road projects will not be significant due to the
already highly degraded nature of the woodland habitat.
Vegetation may also be cleared in areas selected for ancillary sites, such as construction
camps, borrow pits and quarries, to enable the utilisation of these areas.
There are no known wildlife crossings along the length of the ENI road projects and the
habitat has been highly modified by anthropogenic uses. There is no potential for significant
adverse effects on wildlife as there is only one area along the road between Maputo and
Inchope that supports relatively intact woodland. This is within a hunting area (Coutada area
No. 5) which lies between the Rio Save and Muxungue. This section of the highway is not
included as part of the ENI road projects for Phase 1.
3.3.2   Indirect Impacts
There is a potential impact associated with the indirect loss and degradation of vegetation,
habitat and species in the ROI. These potential impacts are associated with:
u improved access;
La in-migration; and
o construction workforce behaviour.
Ecological degradation of the ROI may occur from vegetation harvesting and wildlife
poaching by the construction workforce, and increased harvesting during road operation due to
greater accessibility and additional local demands from road-induced activities.
The projects will provide improved access to the neighbouring areas and facilitate natural
resource use. The main potential for increased natural resource harvesting is likely to occur
within the area's woodlands.
The population increase along the road corridor would be derived either from people migrating
to the roadside from the immediate area (i.e. the 5km region of influence and adjacent to this),
or from other areas. This in-migration has a potential to create an increased local demand for
58602 Annex E- ENI Road Projects   February 2001                              3-10



IMPA U'O
fuelwood and construction timber, as well as other woodland products to support secondary
enterprise activities, such as forage collection for grazing animals. Hunting may also increase.
The proposed road improvements will follow an existing alignment and almost all forest areas
neighbouring this road are currently accessible. The road will only increase potential access to
these forests, not open them up.
Importing a construction workforce into an area may increase demand on local natural
resources due to competition for firewood, woodland products and wildlife. These increased
demands will be focussed on the areas surrounding workforce camps and work compounds.
Worker camps may also encourage the temporary construction of markets and barracas to
service the workers. These temporary facilities may also increase demand on local natural
resources.
3.3.3    Mitigation Measures
i   Direct Impacts
Vegetation clearance along the road edge and at ancillary sites (such as borrow pits) will be
minimised. All construction areas will be clearly marked and construction activity prohibited
outside the defined areas. Tress within ancillary sites shall be retained wherever possible.
Retention of trees within areas such as worker camps will improve the camp amenity and
provide shade.
All temporarily disturbed areas will be rehabilitated following construction. The establishment
of ground cover is the initial priority of revegetation. Ground cover reduces raindrop impact,
binds the soil surface and creates a micro-climate favourable for the establishment of other
vegetation. Species should be selected for cover crops and permanent revegetation. A cover
crop consisting of a rapid growing species and several vigorous grass species should be used to
rapidly establish ground cover on disturbed areas. Permanent revegetation species should be
selected to be consistent with the local native species in the area.
Revegetation will aim to stabilise the road verges and assist the many desirable secondary uses
of the road including:
i production of forage, wood, flowers, fruit, medicinal items;
o shade and shelter;
o fencing and screens; and
o building supports.
Adequate and stable cross-road and road surface drainage is essential to ensure that the effect
of inundation caused by impeded flows is minimised. There are large areas of inundation and
wetland areas along the road, particularly near Macia and towards Vilanculos. These areas
have experienced a change in habitat regime due to prolonged inundation from last years
floods. In these areas, the road forms a barrier and divides the wetlands into two separate
hydrologic bodies and has resulted in alterations to the wetland ecology.
It is recommended that a wetland ecologist inspect the route to determine the need for
additional culverts or waterway structures to reconnect these wetland areas.

IMPA CL'
ii   Indirect Impacts
The most potential for indirect effects was identified to be associated with workforce camps.
This is a temporary effect but may last several years depending on the duration of the works
project. To reduce the potential for increased exploitation of natural resources the following
migration measures will be implemented. The Contractor will:
o provide and maintain adequate drinking and bathing water supplies;
o provide kerosene or other fuel source and stoves for worker use;
Li educate workers about the responsible use of natural resources; and
u ensure workers act in a responsible manner and apply penalties for the harvesting of local
resources (wood, wildlife or wood products).
3.4 SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS
3.4.1    Direct Impacts
i   Loss of socio-economic assets
Improvements to the road will not involve the significant loss of cultivated land and no
displacement of population is required. Cultivation is not continuous along the road and there
is sufficient land for machambas if necessary to be realigned. No major building would be lost
to medium road improvement along the road.
Where an area of cultivated land has to be resumed for road construction, the farmer will be
compensated for loss of production. The following process will be applied:
u where possible the farmer should be notified of the loss of land one season in advance.
This is to avoid unnecessary loss of effort and seed; and
o the value of the lost production should be determined. Compensation will be paid to the
farmer for the value of the lost production.
Borrow pits, storage and equipment areas, and construction camps will be located on marginal
or disturbed land. The acquiring of land for such purposes must be subject to ANE and
Provincial approval. In selecting land, consultation must also be undertaken with local
communities, their traditional leaders as well as local authorities (at District and Ward level).
The EN1 road is Mozambique's most used road. It is also Mozambique's most important road
in terms of the north to south link it provides between the nations capital and the rest of the
country. The Maputo to Inchope section of the ENI has already undergone extensive
rehabilitation and development over the last five-years. It is unlikely that further minor
development or maintenance is likely to have significant impacts on loss of agricultural land,
buildings, sites of cultural value, population displacement. Any improvements are also
unlikely to effect natural resource degradation along or in close proximity to the road.

IMPACL'7
3.4.2   Indirect Impacts
i   Access to Services
Improvements to the Maputo to Inchope road are unlikely to have any more significant socio-
economic impacts in terms of access to services. Availability of services to the populations of
the area although relatively poor is better than most other areas in rural Mozambique.
Improvement of the road may facilitate the ability of for example sick patients to gain better
access to health services.
ii   Improved Access to Markets
Improvements to the Maputo to Inchope should enable goods and services to flow more easily
into the area particularly those associated with improving agricultural production techniques
and yields. A better quality of road would likely reduce transport costs both fuel consumption
and vehicle wear.
iii   In-migration of People
Improvement of roads in other rural areas within Mozambique leads often to increases in in-
migration as advantage is taken of the improved communication. It is probable that some in-
migration will take place particularly in areas in close proximity to the ENI road. The road
already exists and has been trafficable for several years (excluding floods). It is unlikely that
significant in-migration will occur as a direct result of the ENI road projects.
iv    Health Issues
It is likely that the road projects will necessitate the inflow of a number of construction
workers from other parts of Mozambique. The inflow of road gangs, particularly in remote
areas, has a potential for adverse effects. The most often cited problem is the one of HIV-AIDs
and other sexually transmitted diseases. Mitigation measures to prevent these impacts require
working closely with respective government departments; local NGOs, church based
organisations, local communities, and road gangs.  Educational programs for the local
populations are considered to be extremely important in trying to reduce the likelihood of HIV-
AIDs infection.
v    Construction Worker Camps
The health issues related to construction worker camps particularly in terms of the spread of
HIV-AIDs and other sexually transmitted disease have been mentioned above.  A
concentration of workers also attracts other inward migrants who attempt to exploit new
market opportunities. In other parts of Mozambique this have often resulted in the creation of
small-unplanned roadside shops. Such informal sites are often poorly managed in terms of
adherence to health regulations and waste disposal. Mitigation measures should include the
identification of suitable sites for the establishment of small shops and other facilities servicing
road-gangs.

IMPAL'i'O
vi   Recommendations
In conclusion road improvements to the Maputo to Inchope ENI would likely have some
positive impacts. Improved communication would improve the ability of local populations to
transport surplus agricultural production to market. It would also likely to stimulate more
production if farmers knew they had a means of transporting their goods. A better road is
likely to decrease maintenance costs on vehicles as potholes and other problems would be
improved. There are unlikely to be any major loss of land and therefore agricultural
production is unlikely to be effected.
The main negative socio-economic impacts relate to the problem of the spread of HIV-AIDs
infection. Campaigns in other parts of Mozambique have demonstrated that these problems can
be mitigated against particularly if resources and education are directed at the local population
and not just the influx of construction workers.

4 UPGRADING & MAINTENANCE MEASURES
The road works will include environmental impact mitigation measures within the Contract
Specifications. These measures will be incorporated as specific instructions and
recommendations to the Contractor and will be provided in a separate Environmental
Management Plan (EMP). The EMP will identify specific instructors to the Contractor and
will include responsibilities, outputs, costs and timing of mitigation measures.
Design, construction and maintenance mitigation recommendations for the proposed roads
have been formulated to avoid or mitigate potential biophysical impacts.  These
recommendations were primarily formulated from observations made during the inspection
of constructed roads.
The EMP describes the practical means to ensure effective implementation of the mitigation
measures recommended for the potential adverse environmental impacts identified in the
EIA.
The EMP will include but will not be limited to the following elements:
l practical means to implement the recommended mitigation measures;
a  implementation schedule and supervision programme;
Li monitoring and evaluation;
u  institutional strengthening;
o  management and training; and
u  further studies of environmental issues.
In addition, the program also specifies what action will be taken and by whom in the event
that the proposed mitigation measures fail, either partially or totally, to achieve the level of
environmental protection expected.
An outline of the EMP for the construction and operation stage is provided in Part E of this
report.

1 BIOLOGICAL & PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS
1.1 TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS
The road is located in the mid-altitude region of Nampula (the region defined as the area
between 2000 and I OOOm above sea level).
Throughout most of it's alignment the road passes over gently undulating ground at elevations
of between 420m above sea level (e.g., at Nampula City) and 650m above sea level).
A characteristic feature of the landscape is the spectacular granitic outcrops that rise up sharply
from plains. These granitic outcrops known as inselbergs may achieve heights of 1500m
(e.g. Mount Ribaue). The Project road usually lies several kilometres from the base of these
outcrops except approaching lapala, where the alignment passes over the base of Mt Malasa
(1300m asl).
The most spectacular inselbergs are:
o  Serra Chinga (maximum elevation 1,410m);
o Mt Mpalue (maximum elevation 1,777m);
o Mt. Ribaue (maximum elevation 1,554m); and
o Mt Malasa (maximum elevation at 1,314m).
The road is bisected by several perennial streams/river. These flow in a south-north direction.
The most important being:
o  Rio Namatara;
o  Rio Miava;
a  Rio Nhamaquete;
o  Rio Mutivaze;
o  Rio Mocubiri;
o  Rio Mequipui; and
o  Rio Natete.
Through the alignment the road passes through a mosaic of disturbed miombo woodland and
small-scale farms (mainly maize and cassava).
1.2 CLIMATE
The climate in the area of the Nampula to lapala road is classified as dry sub-humid with two
climatic seasons namely a hot and humid rainy season between December and March, and a
cooler and drier season from April to November. The mean annual monthly temperature
averages vary between a low of 21C in July, and a high of 27.5 C in November. Monthly
maximum and minimum average temperatures range between 29.5-32C and 15-19
respectively (Figure 1).

1.3 GEOLOGY
Geological formations of the Pre-Cambrian period (more than 600 million years BP) cover
most of the area. The most important formations comprise granitoid migmatites (rich in
quartz) and in the Nampula super-group two major complexes can be distinguished, namely:
o Gneissic migmatites (P): which cover the major portion of Zambezia Province and include
biotites and amphibolites.
i Granitic migmatites (y): which are important mineralogically and include quartzites,
marble and graphite.
A great portion of the study area is comprised of acidic rocks due to their percentage quartz
content and the soils derived from these are typically sandy. The area is characterised by a
slightly undulating plain where low hills or inselbergs and dambos are found. The height of
these inselbergs varies between 600 and 1200m, while the height of the plain is normally
between 200 and 500m. The major geological features of the region are depicted in Figure 4.

1.4 SOILS
The Nampula-lapala road predominately passes through red sandy soils, red clayey soils, and
brown-grey sandy soils. The distribution of these soil types along the road is illustrated in
Figure 5 and a description of the soil types is given in Table 1.
The soils originate in their majority from acidic rocks and are characteristically red soils
(sometimes brown) of medium to fine texture. These soils are generally well to moderately
well drained and of varying thickness in the superficial sand layer. The clay percentage of
these soils varies between 35 and 50 %. At the bottom of the valleys or dambos are deep
hydromorphic soils that are poorly drained. The structure of the soils originating from acidic
rocks is generally weak to very weak in sandy soils and weak to moderate in soils of medium
to heavy texture (Semo, 1995).

1.5 LAND USE
Small settlements are located at varying intervals along the Nampula to lapala project road and
the larger settlements of Mutivaze, Namina, Ribaue and lapala are characterised by relatively
higher population densities.
The road passes through the following vegetation types - medium thickets, open woodland,
low altitude closed forests and other herbaceous communities all interspersed with cultivated
areas.
Approximately 15-30% of the District is cultivated by family sectors with an average plot size
of 0.5 to 1.5ha generally cleared by slash and burn techniques. The most commonly grown
crops are cassava, maize, groundnuts, sorghum, millet, cotton and sweet potato. These are
grown using a multi-cropping system with more than one yield (average four crops in Nampula
Province) grown in each field.
1.6 RIVERS AND WATER QUALITY
1.6.1    Rivers and Hydrology
The most important drainage basins near the project road are those of the Mecuburi and
Monapo Rivers. These rivers' flow rates vary considerably throughout the year and 90% of
the total volume of discharge occurs between December and April. Characteristically, most of
the rivers do not carry water during the dry season (Figure 6).

Figure 6:    Monthly average flow rate of Monapo and Mecuburi Rivers (Flow rate:

There is a marked difference between the levels of the water table in areas with mainly acidic
rocks (concave almost level ground) and the bottom of valleys with alkaline/base rocks. In the
former, the water table is at or near the surface during the dry season which means that the
population has access to water throughout the entire year, even if only in reduced amounts for

IMPAC IO
domestic purposes. The valley floors with alkaline rocks run dry soon after the rains stop and
unless deep wells are dug, the availability of water is a limiting factor to human settlement in
these areas. These circumstances are linked with the fact that the sandy nature of the soils of
the acidic rocks allows for the infiltration of water into the soils during the rainy season. In
contrast, the muddy soils of the alkaline rocks, with low infiltration capacity, allow for fast
run-off and little infiltration into the soils with the result that in the dry season the bottom of
the valleys no longer contain surface water (Semo, 1995).
1.6.2    Water Quality
Watercourses within the project area experience better water quality when river flows are
highest and dilution is greater. This occurs during the rainy season from November to March,
with flows generally reaching a peak in February and March. However, the rivers have the
highest sediment levels and are most turbid during the rainy season, when overland runoff and
erosion are at their greatest. River flows are lowest during the dry season months of June to
September, and the majority of the watercourses crossed by the road are perennial with no flow
during this time.
Rivers and ponds in the vicinity of the proposed roads are free of chemical pollutants due to
the absence of industry.  Despite this, these water sources may be microbiologically
contaminated near settlement areas due to poor sanitation practices.
1.7 VEGETATION COVER
The stretch of the project road between Nampula and Nova Chave is characterised by
Deciduous Woodland Miombo-Discontinuous Dry Forest-Savanna (Brachystegia spiciformis,
B. boehmii - Adansonia, Sterculia, Bombax). This vegetation type is confined to Mozambique
and covers the subplanaltic zone between 50 and 500m in soils, which are generally red to grey
and derived from granite or gneiss. Figure 7 shows the distribution of the major vegetation
types in areas adjoining the road.
The major vegetation communities include:
o  closed woodland, 12-18m high (including Brachystegia spiciformis, B. behmii);
o  scattered  patches of deciduous  forests (including  Adansonia  digitata, Bombax
rhododnaphalon, Sterculia appendiculata);
o  savanna woodland of medium  height (including Brachystegia boehmii, Julbernardia
globiflora, pterocarpus angolensis);
o  tree-shrub savanna in lower lying areas (including Acacia polyacantha, A. nigrescens,
kigelia pinnata); and
o  deciduous savanna or woodland (including Adansonia, Sterculia, Dalbergia).

Additionally, on the rocky outcrops or inselbergs near Nampula and Ribaue succulent or
xerophytic plants such as Aloe sp. A. Mawii, A. chabaudii, A. corniculata, and Vellozia spp are
abundant (Wild and Barbosa, 1967).
West of the project road, towards Ribaue and lapala, the vegetation composition is deciduous
miombo savanna woodland (Brachystegia spiciformis - Julbernardia globiflora). In areas
bordering vleis (wetlands) and dambos, there is savanna woodland of Brachystegia boehmii,
Julbernardia globiflora, Burkea africana and Parinari curatellifolia amongst others, whilst
secondary areas are typically characterised by Entada abyssinica, Piliostigma thonningii,
Annona senegalensis and Antidesma venosum.
1.8 WILDLIFE
Five forest reserves were gazetted in Nampula Province in 1950, namely Mpalu&, Ribawe,
Matibane, Baixo Pinda and Mecuburi forest reserves. The first two are relatively close to the
project road. Currently the status of wildlife populations in these Reserves is uncertain. During
a recent fieldtrip bushpig, rock hyraxes, and klipspringers were observed (Costa, 1998). The
local communities using dogs, nets and traps commonly hunt the first two.   The latter
however, is a rare species and law in Mozambique prohibits hunting. The use of fire as a
hunting technique is also widespread.
Over the last few years, there has been a considerable reduction in wildlife numbers.
According to Costa (1998), eighteen mammal species were known to occur in these Reserves
(Table 2). At present, it is believed that most of these are locally extinct and even the small
solitary forest-dwelling antelope (suni and duiker) have been eradicated.

Many of the species listed in Table 2 are restricted to the habitats associated with granite
inselbergs. These faunal assemblages are very vulnerable specifically because of the limited
extent and restricted distribution of their preferred habitat.

1.9 CONSERVATION AREAS
Two forest reserves, namely Reserva Florestal de Ribaue (5,100ha) and Reserva Florestal de
Mepalue (5200ha) are located West of Ribaue, in relative proximity to the project road (see
Figure 8). They were created as Integral Forest Reserves (with fully protected resources as
opposed to partial reserves where use of selected species is permitted) in 1950 with two main
purposes, i) to safeguard the rare evergreen mountain forest of the summits and higher slopes
and ii) to protect the catchment areas that feed the drainage basins of the Mpwipwe-Lalawa-
Lurio Rivers (Costa, 1998).
Source: Carta Topografia, 1:250,000
Figure 8:    Forest Reserves of Ribaue and Mepalue
The area is characteristically hilly and of granite-gneissic complex with altitudes varying
between 500m on valley floors and up to 1,553m in Ribaue and 1,777m in Mepalue. Miombo
vegetation in the valleys and in altitudes of up to 1,OOOm include species such as Brachystegia-
Julbernardia-Uapaca whilst in the open terrain, in addition to and associated with the above,
one finds the following: Millettia, Terminalia, Sclerocarya and Parinari amongst others.
Along rivers, vegetation typical of the central and northern part of Mozambique is common,
namely Breonadia, Erythrophloeum, Landolphia, Bombax, Treculia, etc. In areas with
altitudes above 1,100-1,200m rare evergreen mountain forests are present with species such as
Chlorophora, Khaya, Phoenix, Xylia, Treculia and Funtumia.
Due to the lack of institutional capacity and control, local populations have moved into the
Reserves over the last few years destroying a substantial part of the forest along the valleys for
cultivation at altitudes below lOOOm and sometimes even in the evergreen forest area (Costa,
1998). On a broader scale these reserves form part of the great Inselberg Archipelago of
Northern Mozambique, one of four recognised biological hotspots in Mozambique (Hatton,
1998).
This series of habitats occurs south of the Lurio River occupying a rectangular area of
approximately 500km by 160km wide lying in a SW to NE direction (approximately between
140 to 17S; 35040'E to 380 E thence NE-wards to 39040'E).

IMPACIW
This Inselberg archipelago presents a truly remarkable landscape of tall granite core remnants
in a savanna plains land.
The Inselberg Region has high scenic value as well as high biological value characterised by
unique flora and fauna (endemics and biogeographical outliers) contained in the isolated
rainforest, patches of which form aprons around the flanks and base of the inselbergs. Many of
the areas are unknown biologically and it is highly likely that undescribed species remain to be
discovered. Like Gorongosa Mountain these inselbergs are high enough to result in a
continuous belt of high rainfall - an orographic perennial aquifer.
1.10 NOISE AND AIR QUALITY
Noise levels along the Nampula to lapala Project Road, are very low due to the currently low
traffic volumes and sparse settlement. Noise levels are predominantly generated by natural
conditions (for example wind, insects and birds). Noise levels increase within the larger
settlements, particularly near the market areas.
Ambient air quality in all of the proposed road areas is very good due to a lack of air polluting
industries and urban activities. Haze may be observed due to the frequently practiced slash
and burn agriculture and production of charcoal. Levels of airborne dust generated by winds
can also be high over agricultural fields, as can smoke from woodland and grassland fires.

2 SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
2.1 PROVINCIAL CHARACTERISTICS
The purpose of this section is to describe the socio-economic environment for the EN8 road
between Nampula and lapala in Nampula Province. Information has been derived from
existing reports and publications where information is disaggregated usually at the Provincial
and District levels. A field visit was made to the EN8 and Nampula City during November
2000 to supplement information available at the Provincial and District level.
To describe the living conditions for the populations living along or in proximity to the EN8 a
variety of Provincial and District socio-economic indices have been used. Where possible
statistical information has been provided to enable the establishment of base line data from
which the impacts of road improvement may be made.
2.1.1    Context and Administration
i   Provincial setting and administration
Nampula Province is located in the Central Region of Mozambique. To the north of Nampula
Province are the Provinces of Niassa and Cabo Delgado. Bordering to the south is Zambezia
Province and the eastern boundary is formed along the Indian Ocean.
Administratively Nampula is divided into 19 Districts, 71 Administrative Posts, and 103
Localities. The Provincial Capital, Nampula, and the settlements of Angoche, and Nacala-
Porto are designated as cities. Nampula is the third largest Province in Mozambique with a
land surface of 81,606 km2 representing 10.2% of the land surface of Mozambique.
ii   Political environment
In the 1999 elections the RENAMO political party received the majority of the votes cast in
Nampula Province. Political tension exists to the extent that RENAMO believe they should be
allowed to select a candidate as Governor of the Province to reflect their electoral superiority.
The issue of the political allegiance of the Governor is currently vigorously debated in
Mozambique.  Demonstrations in Nampula City against the general elections of 1999
organised by RENAMO resulted in the deaths of two demonstrators.
iii   Traditional administration
Traditional administration authority exists in Nampula Province, although in some Districts the
links between traditional authorities and formal administrative authorities are weak. The
importance attached to the regulos varies from area to area. In those localities where the
regulos are strong and respected he will intervene in a variety of aspects of every-day life.
Such issues would include resolving social conflicts; allocating land for building housing,
managing water sources, supporting official health programmes such HIV/AIDS.

IMPACI 
Like most parts of Mozambique, tensions exist between the two types of administrative
systems. These tensions were exaggerated during the armed conflict. Areas controlled by
RENAMO largely reverted back to traditional leadership structures, while those under
Government control retained their post-independence organisational structures.

The 1997 national survey estimated the population of Nampula to be 2,975,747 inhabitants
with slightly more women (1,495,822) than men (1,479,925). Nampula is Mozambique's most
populated Province. The annual population growth rate is estimated at 2.2% and therefore by
2009 it is calculated that the population will have grown by 34% to about 3,900,500.
The population of Nampula Province is young with more than 1.3 million people under the age
of 14 representing 43% the total population. The population density for Nampula Province
(36.4 inhabitants per kM2) is higher than for the average population density for the country (19
inhabitants per kM2). The total urban population is calculated at 743,638 and the rural
population at 2,232,109. In comparison to other Provinces Nampula has a relatively high
urban-rural ratio with approximately 1 in 3 people living in one of the three designated cities.
ii   Ethnicity
The main ethnic group of Nampula Province is the Macua. The languages spoken reflect the
dominant ethnic group and the three most common languages are Emakhuwa (91%), Coti
(1.9%), Elomwe (0.4%), and Portuguese (5.6%).
iii   Gender
The main ethnic group the Macua are patrilineal meaning that inheritance follows the male
linage. Despite the advancement of the rights of women under independent Mozambican
administration, girls and women in Nampula Province do less well than boys and men. Access
to health services directed specifically at women is generally very poor. Literacy rates for
women are much lower than for men. Family law in Mozambique still discriminates against
women. A married woman has limited rights to make independent economic decisions or
enjoy full ownership of assets, and a widow's rights to inheritance are secondary to males in
the family. Girls in rural areas in general marry young often as soon as they reach puberty.
2.1.3    Economic Characteristics
i   Economy
The economy of Nampula was estimated to have generated approximately US$460 million
between 1996 and 1998 representing approximately 13% of Mozambique's annual output.
Agriculture is the main activity contributing about 40% by value. The category of fishing
contributed 8.5%, commercial activity 13.1%; transport and communication contributed 9% by

value and manufacturing 7% by value. Recent agreements for the mining of titanium will have
a dramatic impact on investment and production for Nampula Province. In 1998 gross
domestic product per head was calculated at $176 with an annual growth rate projected as
15%.
ii   Poverty
According to the National Poverty Assessment (1996-97) 68.9 % of the population of Nampula
Province are categorised as poor. This equates to approximately two million people. This
compares with a national average rate of poverty of 69.4 %.
Life expectancy in Nampula Province (37 years) is below the average levels registered for the
country (42 years). Despite the relative high urban-rural ratio, the vast majority of the
population of Nampula Province (more than 75%) depends on agriculture, forestry and
fisheries for their livelihood, mostly comprising the family sector. There are few formal sector
employment opportunities except in the city of Nampula and Nacala.
2.1.4    Services
i   Education
In 1998 Nampula Province has a total of 1,117 schools: 1,061 lower primary (EP1) schools, 48
upper primary (EP2) schools, seven lower secondary, and one upper secondary (ESG2) school.
The number of students recorded was 286,649 and the number of teachers was 5,746. The
average ratio of pupils to teachers in the Province is 52.
ii   Health
Nampula Province has a total of 21 health units, including three hospitals, 43 health centres,
107 health posts and twenty first-aid posts. There are 54 maternity units distributed throughout
the Province. The illnesses occurring most frequently in Zambezia Province are malaria,
tuberculosis, bilharzia, intestinal parasites, acute respiratory infection, AIDS, sexually
transmitted diseases and non-specific diarrhoea. Current rates of HIV infection are estimated at
approximately 21% and are projected to rise to 25% by the year 2010. It is calculated that
about half of all children under five-years suffer from chronic malnutrition and I in 10 from
acute malnutrition.
iii   Access to services
Access to services for the rural population is generally poor. Most villages do have a primary
school (EPI) (72%), but these schools could be categorised as rudimentary and often
availability of teachers is very low. Figures are not available for the provision of secondary
schools. Most villages do have access to a basic health centre but less than 1% of villages
have access to a doctor. Dependence on traditional healers is the norm for the vast majority of
the population and almost every village would have at least one person categorised as a
traditional healer. Table 3 gives the availability of services on a village basis for Nampula
Province.

2.1.5     Livelihood strategies
The principle economic activity in Nampula Province is agriculture. Most food production is
within the family sector upon which the majority of the population is dependent. The principle
food crop grown is cassava (total production 2,451,576 tonnes) followed by maize (total
production 106,995 tonnes), and rice (22,321 tonnes). Crop production for Nampula Province
is shown in Table 4.

2.2 DISTRICT CHARACTERISTICS
This section describes socio-economic factors more specific to the EN8 road. The main
sources of information relate to existing written reports concerning the Districts the EN8
passes through. In addition, a brief field visit to the EN8 was made during November 2000.
58602 Annex E- Nampula-lapala           February 2001                                    2-4

IMPAC'C)
2.2.1    Context and Administration
i   District Setting
The Nampula to lapala EN8 road passes through the Districts of Nampula and Mecuburi
located in the central-west of Nampula Province. To the north Mecuburi District borders Cabo
Delgado Province. In both District headquarters Nampula and Mecuburi representatives of the
main sector ministries such as health, education, and agriculture.are found.
The EN8 begins in the peri-urban environment on the outskirts of Nampula, within the District
of Nampula passes through the southern part of Mecuburi District and continues into Ribaue
District.
ii   Traditional Administration
Traditional structures exist, to a lesser or greater extent, in most localities side-by-side with the
more modern administrative apparatus of the State and political parties. In general terms the
first government of an independent Mozambique from 1975 attempted to replace the inherited
colonial and traditional systems with a centralised system based upon the political doctrines of
socialism.
iii   Political Environment
No information is available for voting practices based on the Districts of Nampula Province.
Nampula Province voted strongly for the opposition party RENAMO during the general
elections of late 1999.
2.2.2    Population Characteristics
i   Population
The 1997 national census estimated the population of Nampula District as 105,000 inhabitants
with a density of population of 29 inhabitants per km2. Mecuburi District has 119,000
inhabitants with a density of population of 16 inhabitants per km2. The District has three
administrative posts at Milhana, Mecuburi and Namina. Ribaue District has a population of
131,000 inhabitants with a density of population of 21 inhabitants per km2. The combined
population of Nampula, Mecuburi and Ribaue Districts is 355,000.
ii   Ethnicity
Most people living along the road are from the Macua ethnic group. Succession and heritage
for the Macua are patrilineal, and the children are considered to belong to the father. Family
succession is granted to the eldest son.

Mozambique Road Sector EA



IMPACLV
iii    Gender
Inheritance follows a patrilineal system where belongings are passed from father to the son.
On average women will be more illiterate than men, more boys will than girls attend school,
and higher rates of malnutrition are found for girls than boys. Some of the activities carried
out at household level broken down between men and women are described later.
2.2.3     Economic Characteristics
i    Economy
The economy of the three Districts the road passes through is almost entirely based on
subsistence agriculture.
ii    Poverty
The main period of poor nutrition is the period between October and March when crop stores
are at there lowest and before the new seasons harvest. The principal deficiency in dietary
terms for all three Districts the road passes through is lack of vitamin A and iron leading to a
high incidence of anaemia. Chronic malnutrition for children under 3 years is estimated at on
average 42%. Acute malnutrition for the same age group is estimated at approximately 10%.
There is a problem related to intoxication due to the poor preparation of cassava mainly
causing problems of vomiting.
Categorizing families in terms of poor, medium, and rich surveys indicate that on average
within Ribaue, Nampula, and Mecuburi Districts between 70% to 80% of families are poor,
15% to 25 % medium and 0% to 10% rich. Table 5 gives examples of the characteristics of
poverty for an average household in Ribaue, Nampula, and Mecuburi Districts.

2.2.4    Services
i   Education
Ribaue District has 64 EPI schools, 2 EP2 schools, I secondary school, and one agricultural
technical college. Total number of children in school for the year of 1997 was calculated as
16,573 of which 35% were girls. Approximately 50% of all children receive at least one year
of primary schooling. Similar statistics are not available for Mecuburi and Nampula Districts.
Most schools are built of locally available materials (mud and thatch) and only a small
proportion from bricks. Boy's account for the majority of the schools population. The
situation becomes more acute as pupil's progress from primary to secondary. On average in
Nampula 75% of pupils are boys and 25% girls. The main reasons identified for the imbalance
between boys and girls at schools related to the early age of marriage (often as young as
twelve), initiation rites, and the lack of jobs for women after schooling. On average 71.7% of
the population of Nampula Province are illiterate with a higher incidence of illiteracy amongst
women (85.9%) than for men (56.7%).
ii   Health
Nampula District has 3 health centres (Rapale, Anchilo, and Namaita) and 10 health posts.
Mecuburi District has 8 health units and 5 Health Posts (Muite, Napai, Momane, Popue and
Namine). A health unit is a category of health provision below a health post. Within the
District there are 17 health workers (a category of employee with a minimum of a one year
recognised qualification in health work), 17 traditional birth attendants (registered), and 5 first
aid workers (employees who have undertaken a basic course in first aid). Ribaue District has 1
Rural Hospital based at the District headquarters (Ribaue), 1 health centre at lapala, and 5
health posts. The District has 4 doctors, 3 of which are based at the Rural Hospital.
Within Nampula Province 38.4% of children suffer from chronic malnutrition and 6.8% suffer
from acute malnutrition. The most frequently treated health conditions in the three Districts
are malaria, diarrhoea, intestinal parasites, respiratory infections (particularly during the
months of October/November and March/May), tuberculosis, leprosy, sexually transmitted
diseases, conjunctivitis, and bilharzia. The HIV infection rate for Nampula Province is
currently estimated at 17%. Only 6.6% have access to potable water.
iii   Key Social Services and Facilitates
Table 6 summarises by average the distribution of services and median distances for Ribaue,
Nampula, and Mecubiuri Districts. While the three Districts are relatively well served by
primary (EPI) schools access to secondary schools is poor. Availability of qualified medical
staff is extremely low and most families are dependent upon traditional healers to meet their
medical requirements.

2.2.5     Livelihood
i    Livelihood strategies
Subsistence agriculture is the main activity of families living in Ribaue, Nampula, and
Mecuburi Districts. The main food crops grown are cassava, maize, and sorghum. Nampula
District has the largest cultivated area (70,093ha) and the highest total production. Proximity
to Nampula City could be a main factor for the higher concentration of agricultural production
in Nampula District in comparison to Ribaue and Mecuburi Districts. Table 7 shows total
cultivated area by Crop (hectares) and total production (tonnes/metric) for 1999/2000 for
Nampula, Ribaue and Mecubuiri Districts. Livestock farming is very limited in all three
Districts. The extent of the agricultural activity is dependent upon several factors, notably:
u  the fertility of the soil;
Li the availability of water;
o  availability of good pasture;
o  the availability of supportive transportation linkages to facilitate trade;
o  the availability of communication linkages to facilitate trade;
o  population densities;
o  the availability of social services and amenities to support the population; and
o  the availability of supportive formal financial and credit institutions.

ii    General characteristics of a family living along or in close proximity to the
Nampula to lapala EN232/104 road
A typical day for a family living along the Nampula to lapala EN232/104 road would involve
women working in the machambas. Men would and not generally involved in the day-to-day
activities of the machambas, but are responsible for clearing and preparation of land. The
main agricultural system is still based upon slash and burn agriculture. Once land is cleared it
will be cultivated for between 2 to 4 years before being left to fallow for a similar period.
In the house women will look after the children, cook, clean the house, and would be involved
in most daily household activities. Men are responsible for construction and maintenance of
the house. The period of most work is between November and February, the main period of
cultivation and harvest. Women will control the household stocks of food while men will be
responsible for expenditure related to the children. The land cultivated will belong to the
married couple. In the case of the death of a spouse or divorce the belongings will be divided
between the wife and the family of the husband.
2.2.6    Archaeological and cultural sites
The road does not pass through or affect any specific archaeological or cultural sites. Any
work outside the road corridor would necessitate consultation with the Chef do Posto to
identify the existence of any cultural sites such as sacred forests.

3 POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
3.1 IDENTIFICATION
This section provides an assessment of the potential environmental impacts associated with the
Nampula to lapala road works. Environmental factors considered were:
o  land use change;
o  erosion and sedimentation;
o  water quality;
o  hydrology;
o  noise and vibration;
o  air quality;
o  biological effects; and
o  socio-economic effects.
Each of these issues is addressed in Sections covering the physical, biological and socio-
economic environments.
The majority of direct bio-physical environmental impacts will be minor due to the limited
extent of works at any one site and the incorporation of impact mitigation measures into the
improvement works. The road currently has a sufficient and well defined road corridor which
is identified by ANE as 15m either side of the road centreline (Pieter Van Niekerk, pers.
comm., ANE, November 2000).
Indirect effects may result from increased natural resource use due to increased local enterprise
activity to service increased traffic. These impacts are anticipated to be relatively minor as the
road is already well established and major reconstruction works have recently been completed.
Many of the potential environmental impacts associated with the construction of a new road do
not occur to the same degree when a road is improved within the existing road corridor. The
most likely impacts include:
o altered land use patterns due to improved accessibility, such as a change from forestry to
agriculture, or from agriculture to industry (Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997);
o  public health problems, particularly through the spread of communicable disease (Birley,
1997); and
o  increased illegal logging and poaching activities due to improved access into forest areas
(Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997).

3.2 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
3.2.1    Land Use
i   Construction
Temporary areas of land use change will occur as a result from establishment of ancillary sites
such as batching plant sites, borrow pits and workforce camp sites. These sites will be selected
in consultation with landholders and rehabilitated upon completion of activities. Ancillary
sites will be located in degraded areas, where possible, to ensure that large areas of land will
not need to be cleared and the change to land use is not significant. Total land acquisition will
be minimal relative to the project corridor length.
Where possible existing borrow areas will be utilised during the road works to avoid additional
disturbance. The rehabilitation of these sites after completion of the works will be undertaken
through revegetation and levelling the landforn to its original condition. Where new borrow
pits are established these will be located at least 1OOm from the road in accordance with
current ANE guidelines.
ii   Operation
The proposed road works will not have a direct impact on land use change outside the road
corridor, as the extent of the construction works will be contained within the corridor and no
realignments of the road are required. The Nampula to lapala project road is currently wide
enough to cater for the proposed formation width and it will not be necessary to clear an area
within the road corridor as part of the works. Therefore, there will be no impact of changing
the land use.
The village settlements are currently situated at distances of more than 1 Om from the road edge
and resettlement will not be required.
The roadworks are not likely to have a significant effect on adjacent land use activities, as
major works were recently completed for this road.
iii   Mitigation Measures
Rehabilitation and land forming of existing borrow pit sites will result in an environmental
improvement, as rehabilitation will be designed to mitigate these issues.
Mitigation measures for other temporary facilities include:
Li measures identified under socio-economics for selection and negotiation of use; and
o3 rehabilitation of all sites to their original condition, or better, to allow resumption of prior
land use.

3.2.2    Erosion and Sedimentation
i   Erosion Hazard
The dynamic interplay of several key factors dictates the degree of susceptibility to water-
driven soil erosion processes. These are:
o seasonality and intensity of rainfall in relation to water run-off;
o landscape topography in relation slope gradients;
Li soil profile parameters, notably depth and binding properties;
u degree of vegetation cover; and
o magnitude and frequency of seismic events.
For road works in general, where the capacity of existing drainage works to manage water run-
off is exceeded then the interaction of the above factors will determine the extent and
magnitude of erosion processes. These considerations provide the basis to determine the
overall erosion hazard.
The Nampula to lapala project road traverses sandy and red soils of medium to fine texture and
is located within the Rift Valley range, which is an area of high seismic activity (Annexure D).
The road does not pass along steep hilly terrain therefore landslides and instability issues are
not of concern.
Although the soils and the surrounding topography has a medium to high erosion potential, the
erosion hazard along the project road is considered to be low-medium and is a function of the
gentle undulating topography traversed, ranging from 0-6 % grade. Erosion and sedimentation
potential will be greater during the wet season, however the impacts from construction will be
minimal by limiting the area of ground disturbance at any one site, and restricting major
earthworks to the dry period.
ii   Erosion and Sedimentation Potential
Sedimentation is a secondary process of erosion and can be exacerbated by road works due to:
o deliberate and unanticipated modifications to surface and ground water hydrology;
o incomplete rehabilitation of roadside verge areas; and
o road rehabilitation through naturally hilly terrain.
Ground disturbance and the temporary stockpiling of materials during road works can trigger
uncontrolled and or accelerated sedimentation processes. The onset of this process will be
coincident with ground disturbance and will continue up until sites have been stabilised in the
road works zone. The extent of ground disturbance and clearing along the road corridor will
be marginal, with an average width of 1 6m disturbed during the construction stage.
Other areas where ground disturbance and clearing is required during the construction stage is
at stockpile areas, borrow pit sites, construction camps, and work compounds. The fill
required for the road works will be obtained from existing borrow sites or degraded areas
where possible to minimise the need for additional ground disturbance.

IMPAC'UO
iii    Mitigation Measures
The provision of culverts along the road will improve cross-road drainage, reducing
sedimentation effects and scouring within drainage lines. This in turn will improve the
stability of road embankments and minimise sedimentation to the waterways.
Minor reconditioning of the existing culverts will be undertaken where their discharge is
causing downstream erosion. Specific measures for erosion and sediment control include:
u design of drainage works to ensure these collect from and discharge to natural drainage
lines. This may not always be possible for mitre drains and in those situations frequent,
low volume drains are preferred;
o provision of energy dissipation devices where discharge velocities and flows will erode
downstream drainage lines;
o minimisation of disturbed areas;
o design and construction of erosion and sedimentation controls such as diversion banks,
filter structures (filter fences or windrowed vegetation) and sediment traps;
o diversion of significant upstream flows around working areas; and
o undertaking progressive rehabilitation and revegetation of all slopes and disturbed areas.
In addition, temporary erosion control drains will be installed prior to the wet season and no
new road excavation will be commenced during the wet season.
There are no significani slopes that the project road intersects and no significant erosion
stabilisation measures, such as retaining walls will be required on road fill or cut areas.
Establishment of vegetation will be undertaken to prevent localised rill erosion on slopes such
as batters and roadside embankments. The project provides an opportunity to undertake the
planting of trees for soil conservation purposes along the road corridor and within existing
degraded areas, particularly gullies, barren terrain, rivers and at borrow pit sites.
Vegetated embankments will minimise the effects of sedimentation during times of inundation.
The road rehabilitation works are likely to minimise erosion and sedimentation effects to the
rivers and streams with the implementation of roadside drainage and construction of culverts.
3.2.3    Water Quality
i   Construction
Sedimentation and resultant water quality effects were discussed in the previous section. This
section looks at other water quality issues.
Hydrocarbons from used lubricants sourced from improper disposal facilities and poor
operation and maintenance practices for construction vehicles and machinery can contaminate
surface waters. Improper disposal of oil filters and other materials from vehicle and machinery
maintenance can also cause pollution. This can occur during both construction and road
operation, but mostly during the former.
58602 Annex E- Nampula-lapala         February 2001                                 3-4

IMPAC IU
Spilt petroleum fuel, as well as bitumen and explosives residue, also have a potential to
contribute to the pollution of water bodies, but to a very minor extent.
Improper sanitation and waste disposal procedures in temporary construction camps can also
contaminate water resources.
ii   Operation
Borrow areas have the potential to result in adverse environmental impacts if they are not
rehabilitated correctly. If left in poor condition water can collect in the depressions created
and become weed infested as well as providing optimal breeding conditions for insect vectors
of parasitic diseases such as malaria.
Borrow areas have the potential to result in adverse environmental impacts if they are not
rehabilitated correctly. If left in poor condition water can collect in the depressions created
and become weed infested and is a good breeding area for disease carrying insects such as
mosquitoes.
iii   Mitigation Measures
All fuels, lubricants and bitumen will be stored in bunded areas. Vehicle maintenance and
refuelling will be confined to areas in construction camps designed to confine lubricants and
fuel spillages.
Adequate waste disposal and sanitation facilities will be provided at construction camps. Any
waste water or stormwater discharged from the site shall comply with the following objectives:
El  pH range                       6.0-9.0;
l  Total Suspended Solids (TSS)    <50mg/l;
l  Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)    <1500mg/l; and
l  Oils and surfactants            No visible film of oils or petrochemicals.
The Contractor shall ensure that all bitumen and fuel storage areas shall be bunded to contain
at least 120% of the maximum capacity of the largest storage tank. The floor of the bunded
area shall be impervious, and storage facilities and bunds shall be inspected weekly for spills.
3.2.4    Hydrology
i   Construction
All culverts and bridges will be in place prior to the rehabilitation works. The main
construction activity that has the potential to impede flows will be the stockpiling of materials
if placed near drainage lines.
58602 Annex E- Nampula-lapala        February 2001                                3-5
Mozambique Road Sector EA



IMPAL"I'U
ii   Operation
Although the road is an existing feature, it can cause an impedance to flow, alter the natural
channel position and result in increased velocities as a result of this change. The road crosses
eight major watercourses, which do not have culverts. The provision of culverts along the road
will improve cross-road drainage, particularly along the wetland areas.
Adequate and stable cross-road and road surface drainage is essential to ensure that storm
runoff across the road causes minimal damage to the road and minimises the effect of
inundation caused by impeded flows. Cross-road drainage shall be provided by causeways and
culverts to pass catchment flows past the road, either over or beneath it. Road surface drainage
shall be provided by side drains to direct runoff off the road surface.
iii Mitigation Measures
Particular attention shall be given to stockpiling materials away from existing drainage lines
and avoid filling in wetland areas.
All designed drainage works shall be installed at the time of initial road construction to ensure
that flows along drainage lines are not impeded.
Culverts shall be laid in a direction, which is as close as possible to the natural position of the
drainage flow.  This will avoid altering the channel flow  and prevent upstream  and
downstream scouring of the watercourse.
3.2.5    Noise and Vibration
i   Construction
Additional noise will be generated along the road corridor and at ancillary sites during the
construction period, particularly from the increased number of heavy vehicles. Vibration
effects will be negligible due to the generally sandy soil substrate. Peak noise levels generated
by construction activities are expected to be greater than the peak noise levels from road
operation.
Construction noise is generally intermittent and depends on the type of operation, location and
function of the equipment and the equipment use cycle. Noise attenuates quickly over
distance. Excavation noise levels, for example, assuming bulldozer and dump truck activity,
yield a level of approximately 85 dBA at 15m, but decrease by about 3-4 dBA with each
doubling of the setback distance. Received noise would be reduced to approximately 70 dBA
at about 240m.
ii   Operation
Accessibility will be improved following the road works and vehicle noise levels may increase
slightly with an expected increase in traffic volumes. After completion of the works, the traffic
on the Nampula Road is expected to experience a high growth rate due to improved
58602 Annex E- Nampula-lapala        February 2001                                3-6
Mozambique Road Sector EA



IMPA 'LW
accessibility (See Part B). This growth will occur on a low existing traffic volume. Resultant
noise levels in villages and towns would not be significant.
Noise sources and factors which may contribute to the increase in the ambient noise level and
related adverse impacts during the operation of the improved roads will include vehicle noise,
vehicle maintenance and driver behaviour (such as the use of horns).
The improved road design will allow an increase in vehicle speed and some increase in the
overall noise level is likely to result. When traffic speed doubles, this results in a 6 dB(A)
increase in noise level (Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997). The majority of the project road
traverses open cultivation land and wetland areas, the impact from an increase in noise levels
from increased traffic speed will be minimal.
The road works may reduce existing noise levels in villages and towns. The improvement of
roads will result in an improved road surface. This will reduce noise levels through the more
efficient operation of vehicles and less noise from vehicle tyres.
As ambient noise levels are generally lowest at night, the impact from traffic noise is expected
to be greater during these hours.
iii   Mitigation Measures
No national noise level standards exist for highway construction equipment, however the
World Bank recommends the use of construction equipment, which meets international
standards.
The following measures shall be implemented to minimise the impact of noise during the
construction phase:
_ work compounds shall be located at least 0.5km from settlements;
l construction shall not occur between 19:00 and 06:00 hours at sites within 150m of
residential areas; and
o maintenance of machinery and vehicles shall be undertaken and repaired regularly to keep
noise at a minimum.
3.2.6    Air Quality
i   Construction
The deterioration in air quality from dust generation and vehicle emissions during road
construction and operation will be a relatively minor environmental impact. Significant
adverse effects are not expected because of the limited duration of construction at any one site
and the few receptors. Most of the work will occur in open, cultivated areas.
Deterioration in air quality during road construction will be experienced primarily from dust
generated by road works, spoil transportation and disposal. Construction will be primarily
labour based, with excavation and material transportation undertaken by hand, therefore dust
58602 Annex E- Nampula-lapala        February 2001                                3-7
Mozambique Road Sector EA



IMPACT0
generation should be minimal due to the small area and volume of soil disturbance at any one
time. In addition, most construction activities will progressively move along the alignment, so
prolonged deterioration in air quality will not occur at any one site.
ii   Operation
Existing air quality is good and no significant air quality effects are expected during operation.
Traffic volumes are low and the road generally traverses rural road areas.
The level of dust is expected to reduce with rehabilitation as a result of stabilising the road
surface.
Improved road geometry will also reduce exhaust emissions along the project roads by
reducing the roughness of the road surface (particularly by removal of potholes) increasing the
design speed and thereby reducing the need for excessive acceleration and deceleration
(Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997).
iii   Mitigation Measures
Mitigation measures will be implemented in areas where air quality problems would arise due
to construction activities. Areas of concern for dust control are in settlements and sensitive
sites such as schools and hospitals.
Minimising air emissions is particularly important during the construction stage, for activities
such as the operation of borrow pits and in-situ mixing of cement and sand, which have a
potential to generate high dust levels.
During the construction period, the following mitigation measures to suppress dust will be
implemented:
o  Water will be sprayed during the construction period at earth mixing sites, asphalt-mixing
sites, and on cleared surfaces. Water spraying will be undertaken during periods of high
wind, or when necessary, to suppress dust.
o  Operations shall be suspended during periods of dry windy weather, in areas where wind
blown dust is causing a nuisance in settlements or towns.
o  All equipment and plant machinery shall not emit visible smoke for a continuous period of
greater than 10 seconds.
u  All exhaust systems and engines on plant and equipment shall be in accordance with the
manufacturers specifications and kept well maintained to ensure that they have a high level
operating efficiency.
3.3 BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS
3.3.1    Direct Impacts
Vegetation will need to be cleared to undertake the road rehabilitation works and enable road
formation widening and construction of additional drainage. The conservation value of the
58602 Annex E- Nampula-lapala      February 2001                               3-8

IMPAL7 O
road corridor vegetation that will be cleared is low. The woodland areas crossed by the road
corridor are highly utilised, particularly for slash and burn agriculture. The amount of clearing
that will need to be undertaken will be minimal as the road corridor is well defined. The
impact of any clearing required for the road project will not be significant due to the already
highly degraded nature of the woodland habitat and the minor clearing required.
Vegetation may also be cleared in areas selected for ancillary sites, such as construction
camps, borrow pits and quarries, to enable the utilisation of these areas.
There are no known wildlife crossings along the length of the Nampula to lapala road and the
habitat has been highly modified by anthropogenic uses.
3.3.2   Indirect Impacts
There is a potential impact associated with the indirect loss and degradation of vegetation,
habitat and species in areas adjoining the road. These potential impacts are associated with:
o improved access;
o in-migration; and
o construction workforce behaviour.
Ecological degradation of the areas adjoining the road may occur from vegetation harvesting
and wildlife poaching by the construction workforce, and increased harvesting during road
operation due to greater accessibility and additional local demands from road-induced
activities.
The project will provide improved access to the neighbouring areas and facilitate natural
resource use. The main potential for increased natural resource harvesting is likely to occur
within the area's woodlands.
The population increase along the road corridor would be derived either from people migrating
to the roadside from the immediate area (i.e. the 5km region of influence and adjacent to this),
or from other areas. This in-migration has a potential to create an increased local demand for
fuelwood and construction timber, as well as other woodland products to support secondary
enterprise activities, such as forage collection for grazing animals. Hunting may also increase.
The proposed road improvements will follow an existing alignment and almost all woodland
areas neighbouring this road are currently accessible. The recent road improvements would
have already increased access to the area.
Importing a construction workforce into an area may increase demand on local natural
resources due to competition for firewood, woodland products and wildlife. These increased
demands will be focussed on the areas surrounding workforce camps and work compounds.
Worker camps may also encourage the temporary construction of markets and barracas to
service the workers. These temporary facilities may also increase demand on local natural
resources.

IMPA CI U
3.3.3    Mitigation Measures
i   Direct Impacts
Vegetation clearance along the road edge and at ancillary sites (such as borrow pits) will be
minimised. All construction areas will be clearly marked and construction activity prohibited
outside the defined areas. Tress within ancillary sites shall be retained wherever possible.
Retention of trees within areas such as worker camps will improve the camp amenity and
provide shade.
All temporarily disturbed areas will be rehabilitated following construction. The establishment
of ground cover is the initial priority of revegetation. Ground cover reduces raindrop impact,
binds the soil surface and creates a micro-climate favourable for the establishment of other
vegetation. Species should be selected for cover crops and permanent revegetation. A cover
crop consisting of a rapid growing species and several vigorous grass species should be used to
rapidly establish ground cover on disturbed areas. Permanent revegetation species should be
selected to be consistent with the local native species in the area.
Revegetation will aim to stabilise the road verges and assist the many desirable secondary uses
of the road including:
Li production of forage, wood, flowers, fruit, medicinal items;
o shade and shelter;
o fencing and screens; and
o building supports.
Revegetation along different sections of road will be designed to achieve site-specific aims,
such as maximising shade within villages and providing a species composition that is
compatible with surrounding vegetation cover.
ii   Indirect Impacts
The most potential for indirect effects was identified to be associated with workforce camps.
This is a temporary effect but may last several years depending on the duration of the works
project. To reduce the potential for increased exploitation of natural resources the following
migration measures will be implemented. The Contractor will:
o  provide and maintain adequate drinking and bathing water supplies;
o  provide kerosene or other fuel source and stoves for worker use;
o  educate workers about the responsible use of natural resources; and
o  ensure workers act in a responsible manner and apply penalties for the harvesting of local
resources (wood, wildlife or wood products).

3.4 SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS
3.4.1    Direct Impacts
i   Loss of socio-economic assets
Improvements to the road will not involve the significant loss of cultivated land and no
displacement of population is required. Cultivation is not continuous along the road and there
is sufficient land for machambas if necessary to be realigned.
The EN8 has recently been renovated and the next stage of work is unlikely to require further
land to be accessed. The exception may be the uses of borrow pits for road building materials.
Negotiation with local authorities and farmers would secure access for borrow pits and
appropriate compensation established.
Where an area of cultivated land has to be resumed for road construction, the farmer will be
compensated for loss of production. The following process will be applied:
Li where possible the farmer should be notified of the loss of land one season in advance.
This is to avoid unnecessary loss of effort and seed; and
a the value of the lost production should be determined. Compensation will be paid to the
farmer for the value of the lost production.
Borrow pits, storage and equipment areas, and construction camps will be located on marginal
or disturbed land. The acquiring of land for such purposes is subject to ANE and Provincial
approval. In selecting land consultation must also be undertaken with local communities and
their traditional leaders as well as local authorities (at District and Ward level).
3.4.2   Indirect Impacts
The road has recently been rehabilitated and the works proposed are to finalise the
rehabilitation to a sealed road. Any impacts related to indirect effects would have commenced
under the previous roads program.
i   Access to services
Improvement of the EN8 road is likely to have significant socio-economic impacts.
Availability of services to the populations of the three Districts the road passes through is
generally poor. An improved road would enable for example sick patients to gain access to
better health services particularly in the Provincial capital Nampula.
ii   Improved access to markets
The existing road is in generally good condition after recent rehabilitation work and it is
already improving the ability of local communities to transport surplus crop production to
Nampula City. Continued improvement and maintenance to the road will enable goods and

IMPAC 'L
services to flow more easily into the area particularly those associated with improving
agricultural production techniques and yields. Nampula is a major city within easy distance of
the road and offers a market for agricultural production.
iii   In-migration of people and concessions
Improvement of roads in other rural areas within Mozambique leads often to increases in in-
migration as advantage is taken of the improved communication. It is probable that some in-
migration will take place particularly in areas in close proximity to Nampula, which currently
has the greatest population pressure. Regulos have an influence in terms of the local allocation
of land. Mitigating measures should involve working with regulos and other local authorities
to control any possible in-migration.
iv    Health issues
It is likely that improvement of the road will necessitate the inflow of a number of construction
workers from other parts of Mozambique. The inflow of road gangs, particularly into remote
areas has negative impacts. The most often cited problem is the one of HIV-AIDs and sexually
transmitted diseases. Mitigation measures against these likely impacts require working closely
with respective government departments; local NGOs and/or church based organisations, local
communities, and road gangs.  Educational programmes for the local populations are
considered to be extremely important in trying to reduce the likelihood of HIV-AIDs infection.
v    Construction worker camps
The health issues related to construction worker camps particularly in terms of the spread of
HIV-AIDs and other sexually transmitted disease were mentioned above. A concentration of
workers also attracts other inward migrants who attempt to exploit new market opportunities.
Such informal sites are often poorly managed in terms of adherence to health regulations and
waste disposal. Mitigation measures should include the identification of suitable sites for the
establishment of small shops and other facilities servicing road-gangs.
3.4.3    Conclusions
In conclusion road improvements and maintenance to the EN8 are unlikely to have any
significant socio-economic impacts. Rehabilitation of the road has already taken place.
Maintaining the road in a good condition will encourage farmers to explore marketing options
for their surplus production and may encourage the production of cash crops such as cotton.

4 UPGRADING AND MAINTENANCE MEASURES
The road works will include environmental impact mitigation measures within the Contract
Specifications. These measures will be incorporated as specific instructions and
recommendations to the Contractor and will be provided in a separate Environmental
Management Plan (EMP). The EMP will identify specific instructors to the Contractor and
will include responsibilities, outputs, costs and timing of mitigation measures.
Design, construction and maintenance mitigation recommendations for the proposed roads
have been formulated to avoid or mitigate potential biophysical impacts.   These
recommendations were primarily formulated from observations made during the inspection of
constructed roads.
The EMP describes the practical means to ensure effective implementation of the mitigation
measures recommended for the potential adverse environmental impacts identified in the EIA.
The EMP will include but will not be limited to the following elements:
o practical means to implement the recommended mitigation measures;
o implementation schedule and supervision programme;
o monitoring and evaluation;
o institutional strengthening;
o management and training; and
o further studies of environmental issues.
In addition, the program also specifies what action will be taken and by whom in the event that
the proposed mitigation measures fail, either partially or totally, to achieve the level of
environmental protection expected.
An outline of the EMP for the construction and operation stage is provided in Part E of this
report.

1 INTRODUCTION
This Annex contains an environmental assessment for one of four additional roads to be
included as part of the Phase I World Bank projects (giving a total of 15 project roads).
Due to time limitations, no field investigations have been undertaken for the purposes of this
environmental assessment.  The description of the environment, potential impacts and
recommendations have been prepared as a baseline study using information from existing
literature sources, available mapping sources, knowledge of Provincial characteristics and
personal field observations from ANE technical staff.

2 BIO-PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
2.1 TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS
The Project road is located in the coastal region of Nampula Province with a topographic relief
ranging from approximately 180 - 300 m above sea level. The road runs southwest from
Meconta traversing relatively flat to undulating terrain and intersecting several small rivers
before approaching Corrane.
2.2 CLIMATE
The climate within the Nampula province is classified as dry sub-humid and has two climatic
seasons namely a hot and humid rainy season between December and March, and a cooler and
drier season from April to November. The mean annual monthly temperature averages vary
between a low of 21C in July, and a high of 27.5 C in November. Monthly maximum and
minimum average temperatures range between 29.5-32C and 15-19 respectively (Figure 1).

2.3 GEOLOGY
Geological formations of the Pre-Cambrian period (more than 600 million years BP) cover
most of the area. The most important formations comprise granitoid migmatites (rich in
quartz) and in the Nampula super-group two major complexes can be distinguished, namely:
o Gneissic migmatites (P): which cover the major portion of Zambezia Province and include
biotites and amphibolites.
a Granitic migmatites (y): which are important mineralogically and include quartzites,
marble and graphite.
A great portion of the study area is comprised of acidic rocks due to their percentage quartz
content and the soils derived from these are typically sandy. The area is characterised by a
slightly undulating plains. The major geological features of the region are depicted in Figure
4.
There are no major mineral deposits of importance located within the Meconta to Corrane road
section. There nearest deposits are located south of Alto Ligonha and north of Gile, of with
dominant minerals including copper and Mica.

2.4 SOILS
The Meconta to Corrane road section predominantly passes through red clay soils of medium
texture and depth, and brown-grey sandy soils and sandy colluvium soils. A description of the
soil types is given in Table 1 and the distribution of these soil types along the road is illustrated
in Figure 5.
The soils are characteristically fertile deep soils of medium texture and have generally poor to
moderate drainage. The structure of the soils originating from acidic rocks is generally weak to
very weak in sandy soils and weak to moderate in soils of medium to heavy texture.

2.5 LAND USE
The Meconta to Corrane road passes through an area of rich agricultural land with the
predominant land use including cashew plantations and cotton. There is also some production
of semi precious timber. The road is strategically important for access to the National road
(EN 8), to the railway line at Namialo and to the deep sea port at Nacala.
The area has a relatively high population with an average population density of 40 people per
kM2, compared to the national average of 22 people per km2.
The project road begins at Meconta, a locality approximately 55 km East of the town of
Nampula and 3,5 km south of the railway line and road linking the same town and Namialo.
The first I lkms of road pass through a combination of thickets characterised by short shrubs
with heights between 0,5 and 3m, through small cultivated fields and also through areas with
herbaceous formations. The subsequent 10 kms of road pass through open thickets and small
cultivated fields with cashew tress with an average of one tree per hectare. For approximately
the next 9 kms, closed low altitude forest can be found stretching an average 10 km on either
side away from the road.
The subsequent 9 kms of road go through areas characterised by herbaceous formations with
trees interspersed with small cultivated fields. Closed low altitude forest is found adjacent to
the road on the way to Corrane for approximately the following 2.5 kms of road. As the road
approaches Corrane, the last 12.5 kms stretch through small cultivated fields with cashew
(average of less than 1 tree per hectare). A combination of large fields and open thickets are
also found scattered between the smaller cultivated fields
2.6 RIVERS AND WATER QUALITY
The road from Meconta to Corrane crosses five major rivers along its route, including
Ampoense, Mogincual, Mecimete, Nacurreria and Metapa Rivers.
There are no known major industries located along this section of road or within the ROI,
therefore the water quality within these rivers is expected to be good. Sediment loads may be
high during the rainy season, which is typical for watercourses within Mozambique.
2.7 NOISE AND AIR QUALITY
Noise levels along the Meconta to Corrane Project Road, are expected to be very low due to
the currently low traffic noise and sparse settlement along the route. The noise levels would be
predominantly generated by natural conditions (i.e. from insects and birds), however noise
would increase slightly as the road passes the larger settlements, particularly near the market
areas.
Ambient air quality along the project road is expected to be good due to a lack of air polluting
industries and urban activities, typical of other project roads inspected within the Nampula
Province. Haze may be observed due to practiced slash and burn agriculture and production of

charcoal which is frequently practiced in the Province. Levels of airborne dust generated by
winds can also be higher over agricultural fields, as can smoke from forest and grassland fires.
2.8 VEGETATION COVER
The stretch of the project road between Meconta to Corrane traverses Moist Savanna to Mesic
Forest characterised by an annual rainfall of >1000 m. The broad vegetation type of the area is
tardily deciduous miombo, lowland type, and the project road traverses the subtype
characteristic of Nampula Province which includes the Brachystegia spiciformis, B.
boehmii-Adansonia, Sterculia type. (Equivalent to Mapping Unit, 27 Wild and Barbosa,
1967).
This Vegetation type overs the subplanaltic zone between 50 and 500 m. especially in the
sublittoral areas from Angoche to Nampula and traverses soils which are generally red to
grey and derived from granite, gneiss or rocks of the primitive system.
This mosaic include the following communities:
(i)    Closed woodland 12-18 m. high of Brachystegia spiciformis, B. boehmii and
Julbernardia globiflora. In wetter woodland occur elements of the Pteleopsis
myrtifolia forest of sublittoral areas (see Type 2). Sometimes communities with
abundant Brachystegia utilis occur (approaches Type 23).
(ii)   Scattered  patches of deciduous forest with Adansonia  digitata, Bombax
rhodognaphalon, chlorophora excelsa, Sterculia appendiculata (very typical of
these communities), Dialium holtzii, Cordyla africana, Croton megalocarpus, etc.
(Type 49).
(iii)   Savanna woodland of medium  height with Brachystegia boehmii (dominant),
Julbernardia globiflora, Erythrophleum africanum, Pterocarpus angolensis, etc.,
Brachystegia allenii is often represented in shallow or sloping soils (approaching
Type 29).
(iv)   Tree-shrub savanna in the lower lying areas with Acacia polyacantha subsp.
campylacantha, A. nigrescens, A. sieberana, Combretum spp., Kigela pinnata,

2.9 WILDLIFE AND CONSERVATION AREAS
There are no designated conservation areas or Coutadas located within the project road ROI.
The area has been highly disturbed for agricultural purposes and therefore the diversity and
species numbers in the area are expected to be low.
The mammal population within the ROI is expected to be sparse as there are only eighteen
mammal species known to occur within the reserves of Nampula Province and over the last
few years, there has been a considerable reduction in wildlife numbers due to hunting and
habitat pressures. It is believed that most of the species are locally extinct and even the small
solitary forest-dwelling antelope (suni and duiker) have been eradicated.

3 SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
3.1 PROVINCIAL CHARACTERISTICS
The purpose of this section is to describe the socio-economic environment for the road
between Meconta to Corrane in Nampula Province. Information has been derived from existing
reports and publications where information is disaggregated usually at the Provincial and
District levels.
To describe the living conditions for the populations living along or in proximity to the
Meconta to Corrane road a variety of Provincial and District socio-economic indices have been
used. Where possible statistical information has been provided to enable the establishment of
base line data from which the impacts of road improvement may be made.
3.1.1    Context and administration
i   Provincial setting and administration
Nampula Province is located in the Central Region of Mozambique. To the north of Nampula
Province are the Provinces of Niassa and Cabo Delgado. Bordering to the south is Zambezia
Province and the eastern boundary is formed along the Indian Ocean.
Administratively Nampula is divided into 19 Districts, 71 Administrative Posts, and 103
Localities. The Provincial Capital Nampula, Angoche, and Nacala-Porto are designated as
cities. In terms of area, Nampula is the third largest Province in Mozambique with a land
surface of 81,606 Km2 representing 10.2% of the land surface of Mozambique.
ii   Political environment
In the 1999 elections the RENAMO political party received the majority of the votes cast in
Nampula Province. Political tension exists to the extent that RENAMO believe they should be
allowed to select a candidate as Governor of the Province to reflect their electoral superiority.
The issue of the political allegiance of the Governor is currently vigorously debated in
Mozambique.  Demonstrations in Nampula City against the general elections of 1999
organised by RENAMO resulted in the deaths of two demonstrators.
iii   Traditional administration
Traditional administration authority exists in Nampula Province, although in some Districts the
links between traditional authorities and formal administrative authorities are weak. The
importance attached to the regulos varies from area to area. In those localities where the
regulos are strong and respected he will intervene in a variety of aspects of every-day life.
Such issues would include resolving social conflicts; allocating land for building housing,
managing water sources, supporting official health programmes such HIV/AIDS.

Like most parts of Mozambique, tensions exist between the two types of administrative
systems. These tensions were exaggerated during the armed conflict. Areas controlled by
RENAMO largely reverted back to traditional leadership structures, while those under
Government control retained their post-independence organisational structures.
3.1.2    Population Characteristics
i   Population
The 1997 national survey estimated the population of Nampula to be 2,975,747 inhabitants
with slightly more women (1,495,822) than men (1,479,925). Nampula is Mozambique's most
populated Province. The annual population growth rate is estimated at 2.2% and therefore by
2009 it is calculated that the population will have grown by 34% to about 3,900,500.
The population of Nampula Province is young with more than 1.3 million peoples under the
age of 14 representing 43% of the total population. The population density for Nampula
Province (36.4 inhabitants per kM2) is higher than for the average population density for the
country (19 inhabitants per kM2). The total urban population is calculated at 743,638 and the
rural population at 2,232,109. In comparison to other Provinces Nampula has a relatively high
urban-rural ratio with approximately I in 3 people living in one of the three designated cities.
ii   Ethnicity
The main ethnic group of Nampula Province is the Mecua. The languages spoken reflect the
dominant ethnic group and the three most common languages are Emakhuwa (91%), Coti
(1.9%), Elomwe (0.4%), and Portuguese (5.6%).
iii   Gender
The main ethnic group the Mecua are patrilineal meaning that inheritance follows the male
linage. Despite the advancement of the rights of women under independent Mozambican
administration, girls and women in Nampula Province do less well than boys and men. Access
to health services directed specifically at women is generally very poor. Literacy rates for
women are much lower than for men. Family law in Mozambique still discriminates against
women. A married woman has limited rights to make independent economic decisions or
enjoy full ownership of assets, and a widow's rights to inheritance are secondary to males in
the family. Girls in rural areas in general marry young often as soon as they reach puberty.
3.1.3    Economic Characteristics
i   Economy
The economy of Nampula was estimated to have generated approximately US$460 million
between 1996 and 1998 representing approximately 13% of Mozambique's annual output.
Agriculture is the main activity contributing about 40% by value. The category of fishing
contributed 8.5%, commercial activity 13.1%; transport and communication contributed 9% by

value and manufacturing 7% by value. Recent agreements for the mining of titanium will have
a dramatic impact on investment and production for Nampula Province. In 1998 gross
domestic product per head was calculated at $176 with an annual growth rate projected as
15%.
ii   Poverty
According to the National Poverty Assessment (1996-97) 68.9 % of the population of Nampula
Province are categorised as poor. This equates to approximately 2 million people. This
compares with a national average rate of poverty of 69.4 %.
Life expectancy in Nampula Province (37 years) is below the average levels registered for the
country (42 years). Despite the relative high urban-rural ratio, the vast majority of the
population of Nampula Province (more than 75%) depends on agriculture, forestry and
fisheries for their livelihood, mostly comprising the family sector. There are few formal sector
employment opportunities except in the city of Nampula and Nacala.
3.1.4    Services
i   Education
In 1998 Nampula Province has a total of 1,117 schools: 1,061 lower primary (EPI ) schools, 48
upper primary (EP2) schools, seven lower secondary, and one upper secondary (ESG2) school.
The number of students recorded was 286,649 and the number of teachers was 5,746. The
average ratio of pupils to teachers in the Province is 52.
ii   Health
Nampula Province has a total of 21 health units, including three hospitals, 43 health centres,
107 health posts and twenty first-aid posts. There are 54 maternity units distributed throughout
the Province.  The illnesses occurring most frequently in the Province are malaria,
tuberculosis, bilharzia, intestinal parasites, acute respiratory infection, AIDS, sexually
transmitted diseases and non-specific diarrhoea. Current rates of HIV infection are estimated at
approximately 21% and are projected to rise to 25% by the year 2010. It is calculated that
about half of all children under five-years suffer from chronic malnutrition and I in 10 from
acute malnutrition.
iii   Access to services
Access to services for the rural population is generally poor. Most villages do have a primary
school (EP 1) (72%), but these schools could be categorised as rudimentary and often
availability of teachers is very low. Figures are not available for the provision of secondary
schools. Most villages do have access to a basic health centre but less than 1% of villages have
access to a doctor. Dependence on traditional healers is the norm for the vast majority of the
population and almost every village would have at least one person categorised as a traditional
healer. Table 2 below provides a list of services and an indication of their availability for
villages within Nampula Province.

3.1.5    Livelihood Strategies
The principle economic activity in Nampula Province is agriculture. Most food production is
within the family sector upon which the majority of the population is dependent. The principle
food crop grown is cassava (total production 2,451,576 tonnes) followed by maize (total
production 106,995 tonnes), and rice (22,321 tonnes). Crop production for Nampula Province
is shown in Table 3 below.

3.2 DISTRICT CHARACTERISTICS
3.2.1    Context and Administration
This section describes socio-economic factors more specific to the Meconta to Corrane ER572
road. The main sources of information relate to existing written reports conceming the District
the ER572 passes through.   To better assess the possible and probable impacts of
improvements to the Meconta to Corrane ER572, more detailed studies for socio-economic
purposes will be needed.

i   District setting and administration
The Meconta to Corrane ER572 road passes through the District of Meconta located in the
central-east of Nampula Province. To the north, Meconta District borders with the Districts of
Muecate and Monapo.
3.2.2    Traditional administration
Traditional structure exists to a lesser or greater extent, in most localities side-by-side with the
more modern administrative apparatus of the State and political parties. In general terms, the
first government of an independent Mozambique from 1975 attempted to replace the inherited
colonial and traditional systems with a centralised system based upon the political doctrines of
socialism.  However, some efforts are currently being employed towards incorporating
traditional leadership into the formal administrative systems.
i   Political Environment
No information is available for voting practices based on the District of Meconta. Nampula
Province voted strongly for the opposition party RENAMO during the general elections of late
1999.
ii   Population
The 1997 national census estimated the population of Meconta District as 123,097 inhabitants
totaling 35,983 families and with a population density of 33 inhabitants per km2.
iii   Ethnicity
Most people living along the road are from the Macua ethnic group. Succession and heritage
for the Mecua are patrilineal, and the children are considered to belong to the father. Family
succession is granted to the eldest son.
iv    Gender
On average women will be more illiterate than men, more boys than girls will attend school,
and higher rates of malnutrition are found for girls than boys. Some of the activities carried
out at household level such as subsistence farming and herding are broken down between men
and women.
Typical economic activities carried out by women in the District include the brewing of
traditional drinks and pottery. Men make crafts such as baskets, mats and tools and sell
firewood and charcoal.
Family land belongs to the husband but in polygamous families, women may have their own
machambas. In turn, family property belongs to the couple but in case of the death of the
husband, it reverts in favour of the husband's family. The property may also be divided
amongst the wife and children. In case of divorce, the property is divided between the couple.

V    Economy
The economy of the Meconta District is almost entirely based on agriculture.
vi    Poverty
The main period of poor nutrition is the period between October and March when crop stores
are at their lowest and before the new season's harvest. The principal deficiency in dietary
terms is the lack of vitamin A and iron leading to a high incidence of anaemia.
Categorizing families in terms of poor, medium and rich, surveys indicate that on average
within Meconta district between 80% to 85% of families are poor, 10% to 15 % medium and
5% rich. Table 4 below gives examples of the characteristics of poverty for an average
household in the district.

i    Education
According to the District Development Profiles, no information was available on the number
of lower primary (EPI) schools in the district. Three upper level primary (EP2) schools
teaching grades 6 and 7 are located in Corrane, Meconta and Namialo, containing five
classrooms each.
In the District there are 268 teachers for 11,090 pupils. Of the total number of pupils, 58% are
boys. The qualifications of 64% of the teachers in the District are known: 102 have sixth grade
and an additional year of training, six have grade four plus four years of training while 93 have
had no training.

ii   Health
Although no rural hospital exists in Meconta, the district has three health centres. These
are located in the district capital and in the administrative posts of Namialo and Corrane.
Both the Meconta and the Namialo health centres have 20 beds each while the health
centre at Corrane has twelve. Vaccination posts operate from all centres while a maternity
unit operates in Corrane. Nacavala, Mecua and Teterrene localities all have a health post
each although no maternity ward exists.  The latter two posts operate fixed vaccination
posts.
According to the District Development Profiles compiled by UJNDP and UNHCR, 71
health workers are based in the District, namely 32 medical assistants (6 middle, 16 basic
and 10 elementary level assistants), 8 community health workers, eleven orderlies and 20
traditional midwives.
iii   Key Social Services and Facilities
While the District is relatively well served by primary (EPI) schools access to secondary
schools is poor. Availability of qualified medical staff is extremely low and most families are
dependent upon traditional healers to meet their medical requirements.
3.2.4    Livelihood
i   Livelihood strategies
Subsistence agriculture is one of the main activities of families living in Meconta District. The
main food crops grown are cassava which occupies by far the greatest crop area, followed by
maize, sorghum and groundnuts.
Table 5 below shows total cultivated area by Crop (hectres) and total production
(tonnes/metric) for 1999/2000 for the district of Meconta. The District is not one with a
livestock farming tradition but many households keep animals for domestic consumption such
as pigs, goats and chicken. The extent of the agricultural activity is dependent upon several
factors, notably:
o The fertility of the soil
o The availability of water
o Availability of good pasture
o The availability of supportive transportation linkages to facilitate trade
o The availability of communication linkages to facilitate trade
o Population densities
o The availability of social services and amenities to support the population
o The availability of supportive formal financial and credit institutions

ii   General characteristics of families adjacent to the Meconta to Corrane ER572 road
Agricultural activities are carried out by the different members of the family who partake in
sowing, weeding and harvesting. Women are responsible for gathering fuel wood by chopping
down trees alongside men. Men also deal with crop storage. The agricultural produce grown
by the family is mainly used for own consumption but excess is sold in the markets of the
district capital or to traders who come from the provincial capital. It is common to find
families who use the same farmland every year and who do not leave the land fallow. The
main agricultural system is still based upon slash and burn techniques.
In the house women will look after the children, cook, clean the house, and would be involved
in most daily household activities. Men are responsible for construction and maintenance of
the house. The period of most work is between November and February, the main period of
cultivation and harvest. Women will control the household stocks of food while men will be
responsible for expenditure related to the children.
3.2.5    Archaeological and cultural sites
The road does not pass through or affect any known archaeological or cultural sites. However,
any major rehabilitation work would necessitate consultation with the local communities to
ensure that possible sites are as little adversely affected as possible.

4 POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
4.1 IDENTIFICATION
This section provides an assessment of the potential environmental impacts associated with the
rehabilitation of the Meconta to Corrane road works. Environmental factors considered were:
o  Land use change;
o  Erosion and sedimentation;
o  Water quality;
oa Hydrology;
o  Noise and vibration;
o  Air quality;
o  Biological effects; and
o  Socio-economic effects.
Each of these issues is addressed in Sections covering the physical, biological and socio-
economic environments.
The majority of direct environmental impacts will be minor due to the limited extent of works
at any one site and the incorporation of impact mitigation measures into the improvement
works. The ENI currently has a sufficient and well defined road corridor which is identified
by ANE as 15m either side of the road centreline (Pieter Van Niekerk, pers. Comm., ANE,
November 2000).
Indirect effects, may result from increased natural resource use due to increased local
enterprise activity to service increased traffic. These impacts are anticipated to be relatively
minor due to the fact that the road is already well established as the major north-south access
route in southern and central Mozambique.
Many of the potential environmental impacts associated with the construction of a new road do
not occur to the same degree when a road is improved within the existing road corridor. The
most likely impacts include:
o  Altered land use patterns due to improved accessibility, such as a change from forestry to
agriculture, or from agriculture to industry (Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997);
o  Public health problems, particularly through the spread of communicable disease (Birley,
1997); and
o  Increased illegal logging and poaching activities due to improved access into forest areas

4.2 PHYSICAL EFFECTS
4.2.1    Land Use
i   Construction
Ancillary activities are temporary activities required during the construction period and will
affect a relatively small land area. These sites will be selected in consultation with the
landowners and rehabilitated upon completion of activities. Ancillary sites will be located in
areas close to existing settlements, where possible, to ensure that large areas of land will not
need to be cleared and the land use is consistent to the area.
Total land acquisition will be minimal relative to the project corridor length. Temporary areas
of land use change will occur as a result from establishment of ancillary sites such as batching
plant sites, borrow pits and workforce camp sites.
Where possible existing borrow areas will be utilised during the road works to avoid additional
disturbance. The rehabilitation of these sites after completion of the works will be undertaken
through revegetation and levelling the landform to its original condition. Where new borrow
pits are established these will be located at least 100m from the road in accordance with
current ANE guidelines.
ii   Operation
The proposed road works will not have a direct impact on land use change outside the road
corridor. The extent of the road to be rehabilitated includes a length of 68 km which will be
maintained within the road corridor and no realignments of the road are required. The
Meconta to Corrane road is currently in a highly degraded condition and rehabilitation works
will involve a road formation width of 6 m wide.
The road is also located within a highly populated area of Nampula Province and crosses an
important agricultural area which has links to the EN 8 leading to the provincial capital of
Nampula, the railway line at Namialo and the deep sea port of Nacala. Encroachment of
settlements and cultivated subsistence farming within the road corridor may occur along some
sections of the road in which case the land use will change due to the road works. The impact
is expected to be minor and compensatory measures will apply as discussed in Section 3.3.
The road works are not likely to have a significant effect on adjacent land use activities, as the
area is currently accessible however the road rehabilitation will improve the travelling time and
access of agricultural products to the major centres. This may result in an indirect effect of
increased agriculture and market areas.
iii   Mitigation Measures
Ancillary sites will be located in areas currently cleared or degraded, where possible, to ensure
that large areas of land will not need to be cleared and the land use is consistent to the area.

All ancillary sites will be rehabilitated upon completion of activities to their previous land use,
unless the facilities are further required.
Mitigation measures for other temporary facilities include:
o  Measures identified under socio-economics for selection and negotiation of use; and
o  Rehabilitation of all sites to their original condition, or better, to allow resumption of prior
land use.
4.2.2    Erosion and Sedimentation
Erosion Hazard
The dynamic interplay of several key factors dictates the degree of susceptibility to water-
driven soil erosion processes. These are:
o  Seasonality and intensity of rainfall in relation to water run-off;
u  Landscape topography in relation slope gradients;
o  Soil profile parameters, notably depth and binding properties;
o  Degree of vegetation cover; and
o  Magnitude and frequency of seismic events.
For road works in general, where the capacity of existing drainage works to manage water run-
off is exceeded then the interaction of the above factors will determine the extent and
magnitude of erosion processes. These considerations provide the basis to determine the
overall erosion hazard.
The rating for erosion risk has been determined from the Mozambique Erosion Hazard Map,
1:2,000,000 produced by the Soil and Water Conservation and Land Utilization Co-ordination
Unit (1986).
The Meconta to Corrane road predominantly passes through red sandy clay loams, brown
sandy clay soils. These soils are characteristically fertile deep soils of medium texture giving
them a relatively low erosion risk. The erosion hazard along the project road is considered to
be low-medium according to the erosion hazard mapping and the road does not pass along
steep hilly terrain or areas of high seismic activity therefore landslides and mass wasting issues
are not of concern.
Erosion and sedimentation effects will be greater during the rainy period which occurs from
November to March. During this period 85 to 90 percent of the annual rains occur and erosion
potential will be highest. The impacts from construction will be minimal by limiting the area
of ground disturbance at any one site, and restricting works to the dry period.
Localised erosion can occur where soils are left exposed. This is commonly observed on steep
unrehabilitated borrow pit batters where gully erosion is evident. Similar problems can occur
on fill batters or other sloped areas.

ii   Sedimentation Risk
Sedimentation is a secondary process of erosion and can be exacerbated by road works due to:
i deliberate and unanticipated modifications to surface and ground water hydrology;
zi incomplete rehabilitation of roadside verge areas; and
o road rehabilitation through naturally hilly terrain.
Ground disturbance and the temporary stockpiling of materials during road works can trigger
uncontrolled and or accelerated sedimentation processes. The onset of this process will be
coincident with ground disturbance and will continue up until sites have been stabilised in the
road works zone. The extent of ground disturbance and clearing along the road corridor will
be marginal, with an average width of 16m disturbed during the construction stage. The
potential for sedimentation will be higher during times of heavy rain where the road becomes
submerged due to localised flooding from the drainage lines.
Other areas where ground disturbance and clearing is required during the construction stage is
at stockpile areas, borrow pit sites, construction camps, and work compounds. The fill
required for the road works will be obtained from existing borrow sites or degraded areas
where possible to minimise the need for additional ground disturbance.
The terrain along the project road is gently undulating and therefore the potential for erosion
from the improvement works is not significant. The soil types intersected by the road have a
moderate soil erodability rating with reference to sheet erosion potential (Wambeke, 1986).
There are no areas where significant cut and fill is required and retaining walls will not be
required. The need for road embankments will be minimal and will not create sedimentation
problems if vegetated properly and formed on 1:2 grades.
Ground disturbance and the temporary stockpiling of materials during road construction works
result in sedimentation adjacent to the drainage lines. Sedimentation can occur from the time
of ground disturbance up until sites have been stabilised along the length of construction
works. The potential for sedimentation will be higher during times of heavy rain where the
road becomes submerged due to localised flooding from the drainage lines. The provision of
culverts along the road will improve cross-road drainage and reduce scouring and erosion of
the road formation and adjacent land form.
The fill required for the road works will be obtained from existing borrows areas where
possible. These locations have high erosion potential due to large areas of ground disturbance
and steep slopes created.
iii   Mitigation Measures
The impact from sedimentation will be minimised by avoiding stockpiling of materials near
drainage lines and by not undertaking construction during times of heavy rain, particularly the
months of December to March.
Minor reconditioning of the existing culverts will be undertaken where their discharge is
causing downstream erosion. Specific measures for erosion and sediment control include:

o  design of drainage works to ensure these collect from and discharge to natural drainage
lines. This may not always be possible for mitre drains and in those situations frequent,
low volume drains are preferred;
o provision of energy dissipation devices where discharge velocities and flows will erode
downstream drainage lines;
o  minimisation of disturbed areas;
o design and construction of erosion and sedimentation controls such as diversion banks,
filter structures (filter fences or windrowed vegetation) and sediment traps;
o diversion of significant upstream flows around working areas; and
Li undertaking progressive rehabilitation and revegetation of all slopes and disturbed areas.
In addition, temporary erosion control drains will be installed prior to the wet season and no
new road excavation will be commenced during the wet season.
The installation of side drains and culverts along the road will minimise sedimentation and
runoff effects during operation of the road.
4.2.3    Water Quality
i    Construction
The potential for sedimentation from construction activities is described in the previous section
and will have an impact on water quality. The rates of sedimentation will be higher during the
rainy season therefore construction impacts will be minimised by undertaking works during the
dry season because most of the streams intersected by the road are perennial. The occurrence
of sedimentation in permanent watercourses will have a greater effect during the dry season
when flows are low.
Hydrocarbons sourced from improper disposal facilities for used lubricants and poor operation
and maintenance practices for construction vehicles and machinery can contaminate surface
waters. Improper disposal of oil filters and other materials from vehicle and machinery
maintenance can also cause pollution. This can occur during both construction and road
operation, but mostly during the former.
Spilled petroleum fuel, as well as bitumen and explosives residue, also have a potential to
contribute to the pollution of waterbodies, but to a very minor extent.
Improper sanitation and waste disposal procedures in temporary construction camps can also
contaminate water resources.
ii    Operation
Borrow areas have the potential to result in adverse environmental impacts if they are not
rehabilitated correctly. If left in a poor condition water can collect in the depressions created
and become weed infested as well as providing optimal breeding conditions for insect vectors
of parasitic diseases such as malaria

iii   Mitigation Measures
Proper management of construction camps is required to prevent pollution to neighbouring
waterways. Any pollution resulting from these camps shall be remediated immediately.
All fuels, lubricants and bitumen will be stored in bunded areas. Vehicle maintenance and
refuelling will be confined to areas in construction camps designed to confine lubricants and
fuel spillages.
Adequate waste disposal and sanitation facilities will be provided at construction camps. Any
wastewater or stormwater discharged from the site shall comply with the following objectives:
:  pH range                        6.0-9.0
:  Total Suspended Solids (TSS)    <50mg/I
zi Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)    <1500mg/I
o  Oils and surfactants            No visible film of oils or petrochemicals
The Contractor shall ensure that all bitumen and fuel storage areas shall be bunded to contain
at least 120% of the maximum capacity of the largest storage tank. The floor of the bunded
area shall be impervious, and storage facilities and bunds shall be inspected weekly for spills.
4.2.4    Hydrology
i   Construction
The road works will have a negligible impact to hydrology, as the rehabilitation works will be
undertaken along an existing alignment. The main construction activity that has the potential
to impede flows will be the stockpiling of materials if placed near drainage lines.
ii   Operation
Although the road is an existing feature, it can cause an impedance to flow, alter the natural
channel position and result in increased velocities as a result of this change. The road crosses
five major watercourses, which will require the provision of adequate sized culverts.
Adequate and stable cross-road and road surface drainage is essential to ensure that storm
runoff across the road causes minimal damage to the road and minimises the effect of
inundation caused by impeded flows. Cross-road drainage shall be provided by causeways and
culverts to pass catchment flows past the road, either over or beneath it. Road surface drainage
shall be provided by side drains to direct runoff off the road surface.
iii   Mitigation Measures
Particular attention shall be given to stockpiling materials away from existing drainage lines
and avoid filling in wetland areas.

All designed drainage works shall be installed at the time of initial road construction to ensure
that flows along drainage lines are not impeded.
Culverts shall be laid in a direction, which is as close as possible to the natural position of the
drainage flow.  This will avoid altering the channel flow  and prevent upstream  and
downstream scouring of the watercourse.
4.2.5    Noise and Vibration
i   Construction
Some sensitive receptors, such as schools and hospitals, are located within 5-lOm of the ENI
road pavement. Additional noise will be generated along the ENI road corridors and at
ancillary sites during the construction period, particularly from the increased number of heavy
vehicles. Vibration effects will be negligible due to the generally sandy soil substrate. Peak
noise levels generated by construction activities are expected to be greater than the peak noise
levels from road operation.
Construction noise is generally intermittent and depends on the type of operation, location and
function of the equipment and the equipment use cycle. Noise attenuates quickly over
distance. Excavation noise levels, for example, assuming bulldozer and dump truck activity,
yield a level of approximately 85 dBA at 15m, but decrease by about 3-4 dBA with each
doubling of the setback distance, and would be reduced to approximately 70 dBA at about
240m.
ii    Operation
Accessibility will be improved following the road works but improvements are not expected to
generate additional traffic. Traffic growth is expected to be similar to historic growth. Noise
levels from traffic will not be increased as a result of the project.
Noise sources and factors which may contribute to the increase in the ambient noise level and
related adverse impacts during the operation of the improved roads will include vehicle noise,
vehicle maintenance and driver behaviour (such as the use of horns).
The improved road design will allow an increase in vehicle speed and some increase in the
overall noise level is likely to result. When traffic speed doubles, this results in a 6 dB(A)
increase in noise level (Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997). The majority of the project roads
traverse open cultivated land and the impact from an increase in noise levels from increased
traffic speed will be minimal.
The road works may reduce existing noise levels in built-up areas as a result of improved road
surface. This will reduce noise levels through the more efficient operation of vehicles and less
noise from vehicle tyres.
As ambient noise levels are generally lowest at night, the impact from traffic noise is expected
to be greater during these hours.

iii   Mitigation Measures
No national noise level standards currently exist for highway construction equipment in
Mozambique, however the World Bank recommends the use of construction equipment, which
meets international standards.
The following measures shall be implemented to minimise the impact of noise during the
construction stage:
Eo In construction sites within 150 m of residential areas, construction cannot occur from
6:00 am -7:00 pm.
z Maintenance of machinery and vehicles shall be undertaken regularly to keep noise at a
minimum.
4.2.6    Air Quality
i   Construction
The deterioration in air quality from dust generation and vehicle emissions during road
construction and operation will be a relatively minor environmental impact. Significant
adverse effects are not expected because of the limited duration of construction at any one site
and the few receptors. Most of the work will occur in open, cultivated areas.
Deterioration in air quality during road construction will be experienced primarily from dust
generated by road works, spoil transportation and disposal. Construction will be primarily
labour based, with excavation and material transportation undertaken by hand, therefore dust
generation should be minimal due to the small area and volume of soil disturbance at any one
time. In addition, most construction activities will progressively move along the alignment, so
prolonged deterioration in air quality will not occur at any one site.
ii   Operation
Existing air quality is good and no significant air quality effects are expected during operation.
Traffic volumes are low and the road generally traverses rural road areas. Exhaust emissions
from traffic utilising the rehabilitated road are likely to increase due to an expected increase in
traffic growth. The emissions are still expected to be low because existing traffic numbers
currently utilising the road are relatively low.
Improved road geometry will reduce exhaust emissions along the project road by reducing the
roughness of the road surface (particularly by removal of potholes) increasing the design speed
and thereby reducing the need for excessive acceleration and deceleration (Tsunokawa and
Hoban, 1997).

lIMPA CTO Lda dtM EC
iii   Mitigation Measures
Mitigation measures will be implemented in areas where air quality problems would arise due
to construction activities. Areas of concern for dust control are in major settlements and
sensitive sites such as schools and hospitals.
Minimising air emissions is particularly important during the construction stage, for activities
such as the operation of borrow pits and in-situ mixing of cement and sand, which have a
potential to generate high dust levels.
During the construction period, the following mitigation measures to suppress dust will be
implemented:
a  Water will be sprayed during the construction period at earth mixing sites, asphalt-mixing
sites, and on cleared surfaces. Water spraying will be undertaken during periods of high
wind, or when necessary, to suppress dust;
a  Operations shall be suspended during periods of dry windy weather, in areas where wind
blown dust is causing a nuisance in settlements or towns;
u  All equipment and plant machinery shall not emit visible smoke for a continuous period of
greater than 10 seconds, and
L  All exhaust systems and engines on plant and equipment shall be in accordance with the
manufacturers specifications and kept well maintained to ensure that they have a high level
operating efficiency.
4.3 BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS
4.3.1    Direct impacts
Vegetation will need to be cleared to undertake the road rehabilitation works and enable road
formation widening and construction of additional drainage. The conservation value of the
road corridor vegetation that will be cleared is not high. The woodland areas crossed by the
road corridor are highly utilised, particularly for slash and burn agriculture, which is frequently
practiced in the Province. The amount of clearing that will need to be undertaken will be
minimal, as the road corridor is well defined for the majority of its length. The impact of any
clearing required for the road projects will not be significant due to the already highly
degraded nature of the woodland habitat.
Vegetation may also be cleared in areas selected for ancillary sites, such as construction
camps, borrow pits and quarries, to enable the utilisation of these areas.
There are no known wildlife crossings along the length of the road project and the habitat has
been highly modified by anthropogenic uses. The road works have no potential for significant
adverse effects on wildlife.

4.3.2    Indirect impacts
There is a potential impact associated with the indirect loss and degradation of vegetation,
habitat and species in the ROI. These potential impacts are associated with:
o Improved access;
i In-migration; and
Li Construction workforce behaviour.
Ecological degradation of the ROI may occur from vegetation harvesting and wildlife
poaching by the construction workforce, and increased harvesting during road operation due to
greater accessibility and additional local demands from road-induced activities.
The projects will provide improved access to the neighbouring areas and facilitate natural
resource use. The main potential for increased natural resource harvesting is likely to occur
within the area's woodlands.
The population increase along the road corridor would be derived either from people migrating
to the roadside from the immediate area (i.e. the 5km region of influence and adjacent to this),
or from other areas. This in-migration has a potential to create an increased local demand for
fuelwood and construction timber, as well as other woodland products to support secondary
enterprise activities, such as forage collection for grazing animals. Hunting may also increase.
The proposed road improvements will follow an existing alignment and almost all forest areas
neighbouring this road are currently accessible. The road will only increase potential access to
these forests, not open them up.
Importing a construction workforce into an area may increase demand on local natural
resources due to competition for firewood, woodland products and wildlife. These increased
demands will be focussed on the areas surrounding workforce camps and work compounds.
Worker camps may also encourage the temporary construction of markets and barracas to
service the workers. These temporary facilities may also increase demand on local natural
resources.
4.3.3    Mitigation measures
i   Direct Impacts
Vegetation clearance along the road edge and at ancillary sites (such as borrow pits) will be
minimised. All construction areas will be clearly marked and construction activity prohibited
outside the defined areas. Tress within ancillary sites shall be retained wherever possible.
Retention of trees within areas such as worker camps will improve the camp amenity and
provide shade.
All temporarily disturbed areas will be rehabilitated following construction. The establishment
of ground cover is the initial priority of revegetation. Ground cover reduces raindrop impact,
binds the soil surface and creates a micro-climate favourable for the establishment of other
vegetation. Species should be selected for cover crops and permanent revegetation. A cover
crop consisting of a rapid growing species and several vigorous grass species should be used to

rapidly establish ground cover on disturbed areas. Permanent revegetation species should be
selected to be consistent with the local native species in the area.
Revegetation will aim to stabilise the road verges and assist the many desirable secondary uses
of the road including:
o production of forage, wood, flowers, fruit, medicinal items;
o shade and shelter;
o fencing and screens; and
o  building supports.
Revegetation along different sections of road will be designed to achieve site-specific aims,
such as maximising shade within villages and providing a species composition that is
compatible with surrounding vegetation cover.
ii   Indirect Impacts
The most potential for indirect effects was identified to be associated with workforce camps.
This is a temporary effect but may last several years depending on the duration of the works
project. To reduce the potential for increased exploitation of natural resources the following
migration measures will be implemented. The Contractor will:
o provide and maintain adequate drinking and bathing water supplies;
o provide kerosene or other fuel source and stoves for worker use;
o educate workers about the responsible use of natural resources; and
o ensure workers act in a responsible manner and apply penalties for the harvesting of local
resources (wood, wildlife or wood products).
4.4 SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
4.4.1    Direct impacts
i   Loss of agricultural land, buildings, sites of cultural value, population displacement,
and natural resources degradation
Improvements to the road will not involve the significant loss of cultivated land, major
buildings or require the displacement of the local population. Cultivation is not continuous
along the road and there is sufficient land for machambas if necessary to be realigned.
Land may need to be acquired for the purposes of borrow pits as a source for road building
materials. Negotiation with local authorities and farmers would secure access for borrow pits
and appropriate compensation established.
Where an area of cultivated land has to be resumed for road construction, the farmer should be
compensated for loss of production. The following process will be applied:

Li Where possible the farmer should be notified of the loss of land one season in advance.
This is to avoid unnecessary loss of effort and seed; and
io The value of the lost production should be determined in consultation with the District
Agricultural Officer and the local Chief of Post. Compensation will be paid to the farmer
for the value of the lost production.
Borrow pits, storage and equipment areas, and construction camps will be located on marginal
or disturbed land. The acquiring of land for such purposes must be subject to ANE and
Provincial approval.  In selecting land consultation must also be undertaken with local
communities and their traditional leaders as well as local authorities (at District and Ward
level).
4.4.2    Indirect impacts
The road has recently been rehabilitated and the works proposed are to finalise the
rehabilitation to a sealed road. Any impacts related to indirect effects would have commenced
under the previous roads program.
i    >.ccess to services
Improvement of the Meconta to Corrane road is likely to have significant socio-economic
impacts by enabling better access to services such as better health services located in the
Provincial capital of Nampula, as well as Nametil and Angoche.
ii   Improved access to markets
As the road is located within a rich agricultural area, the road rehabilitation is expected to
provide better opportunities for the local communities to transport surplus crop production to
Nampula City, Nametil and the port town of Angoche. These three major centres are within
easy distance of the road and offers a market for agricultural production. Continued
improvement and maintenance to the road will enable goods and services to flow more easily
into the area particularly those associated with improving agricultural production techniques
and yields.
iii   In-migration of people and concessions
Improvement of roads in other rural areas within Mozambique leads often to increases in in-
migration as advantage is taken of the improved communication. It is probable that some in-
migration will take place particularly in areas in close proximity to Nampula, which currently
has the greatest population pressure. Regulos have an influence in terms of the local allocation
of land. Mitigating measures should involve working with regutlos and other local authorities
to control any possible in-migration.
iv    Health issues
Further maintenance of the road is unlikely to require the inflow of significant numbers of
workers and therefore health issues normally associated with road gangs in other parts of
Mozambique would not have an impact.

v    Construction worker camps
As above in the health section, an influx of migrant workers is not envisaged and therefore no
impacts are predicted.
In conclusion road improvements and maintenance to the EN8 are unlikely to have any
significant socio-economic impacts.  Rehabilitation of the road has already taken place.
Maintaining the road in a good condition will encourage farmers to explore marketing options
for their surplus production and may encourage the production of cash crops such as cotton.
However, further studies are needed to better predict probable socio-economic impacts, which
would occur as a result of the road rehabilitation.
4.5 SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
4.5.1    Direct impacts
i   Loss of agricultural land, buildings, sites of cultural value, population displacement,
and natural resources degradation
No displacement of population is likely and no major buildings are likely to be lost. However,
it was not possible to undertake an inspection of the road for the purposes of this report and all
information provided has been extrapolated from existing literature and knowledge of other
roads within the Nampula Province. It is not envisaged that there will be any displacement of
population of the local population due to road improvements.
Land acquisition may be required for the purpose of borrow pits to obtain road building
materials. Negotiation with local authorities and farmers would secure access for borrow pits
and appropriate compensation established.
Where an area of cultivated land has to be resumed for road construction, the farmer should be
compensated for loss of production. The following process will be applied:
o Where possible the farmer should be notified of the loss of land one season in advance.
This is to avoid unnecessary loss of effort and seed; and
3 The value of the lost production should be determined in consultation with the District
Agricultural Officer and the local Chief of Post. Compensation will be paid to the farmer
for the value of the lost production.
Borrow pits, storage and equipment areas, and construction camps will be located on marginal
or disturbed land. The acquiring of land for such purposes must be subject to ANE and
Provincial approval. In selecting land consultation must also be undertaken with local
communities and their traditional leaders as well as local authorities (at District and Ward
level).

4.5.2    Indirect impacts
The road has recently been rehabilitated and the works proposed are to finalise the
rehabilitation to a sealed road. Any impacts related to indirect effects would have commenced
under the previous roads program.
i   Access to services
Improvement of the Meconta to Corrane road is likely to have significant socio-economic
impacts. Availability of services to the populations of the District the road passes through is
generally poor. An improved road would enable for example sick patients to gain access to
better health services particularly in the Provincial capital Nampula.
ii   Improved access to markets
Continued improvement and maintenance to the road will enable goods and services to flow
more easily into the area particularly those associated with improving agricultural production
techniques and yields. Nampula is a major city within easy distance of the road and offers a
market for agricultural production. The road rehabilitation will improve the ability of local
communities to transport surplus crop production to Nampula City.
iii   In-migration of people and concessions
Improvement of roads in other rural areas within Mozambique leads often to increases in in-
migration as advantage is taken of the improved communication. It is probable that some in-
migration will take place particularly in areas in close proximity to Nampula, which currently
has the greatest population pressure. Regulos have an influence in terms of the local allocation
of land. Mitigating measures should involve working with regulos and other local authorities
to control any possible in-migration.
iv    Health issues
It is likely that the road project will necessitate the inflow of a number of construction workers
from other parts of Mozambique. The inflow of road gangs, particularly into remote areas has
a potential for adverse effects. The most often cited problem is the one of HIV-AIDs and
sexually transmitted diseases.  Mitigation measures against these likely impacts require
working closely with respective govemment departments; local NGOs and/or church based
organisations, local communities and road gangs. Educational programmes for the local
populations are considered to be extremely important in trying to reduce the likelihood of HIV-
AlDs infection.
v    Construction worker camps
The health issues related to construction worker camps particularly in terms of the spread of
HIV-AIDs and other sexually transmitted diseases have been mentioned above.  A
concentration of workers also attracts other inward migrants who attempt to exploit new
market opportunities. In other parts of Mozambique this has often resulted in the creation of
small unplanned roadside shops. Such informal sites are often poorly managed in terms of

adherence to health regulations and waste disposal. Mitigation measures should include the
identification of suitable sites for the establishment of small shops and other facilities servicing
road-gangs.
vi   Recommendations
In conclusion road improvements and maintenance to the Meconta to Corrane road section are
unlikely to have any significant socio-economic impacts. Maintaining the road in a good
condition will encourage farmers to explore marketing options for their surplus production and
may encourage the production of cash crops such as cotton.
The main negative socio-economic impacts relate to the problem of the spread of HIV-AIDs
infection. Campaigns in other parts of Mozambique have demonstrated that these problems
can be mitigated against, particularly if resources and education are directed at the local
population and not just the influx of construction workers.
Further studies are recommended to better predict probable socio-economic impacts, which
would occur as a result of the road rehabilitation.

5 ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION MEASURES
The road works will include environmental impact mitigation measures within the Contract
Specifications. These measures will be incorporated as specific instructions and
recommendations to the Contractor and will be provided in a separate Environmental
Management Plan (EMP). The EMP will identify specific instructions to the Contractor and
will include responsibilities, outputs, costs and timing of mitigation measures.
Design, construction and maintenance mitigation recommendations for the proposed roads
have been formulated to avoid or mitigate potential bio-physical impacts.  These
recommendations were primarily formulated from observations made during the inspection of
constructed roads.
The EMP describes the practical means to ensure effective implementation of the mitigation
measures recommended for the potential adverse environmental impacts identified in the EIA.
The EMP will include but will not be limited to the following elements:
Practical means to implement the recommended mitigation measures;
o Implementation Schedule and Supervision Programme;
o Monitoring and Evaluation;
oi Institutional Strengthening, Management and Training; and
o Further Studies of Environmental Issues.
In addition, the program also specifies what action will be taken and by whom in the event that
the proposed mitigation measures fail, either partially or totally, to achieve the level of
environmental protection expected.
Specific socio-economic impact mitigation measures will include further consultation with
potentially affected landholders and provision of compensatory measures in accordance with
the current Government of Mozambique policy. These measures have been formulated by the
Department of Agriculture and include guidelines for the displacement of people and
acquisition of land for the roads.
An outline of the EMP for the construction and operation stage is provided in Part E of this
report.

1 INTRODUCTION
This Annex contains an environmental assessment for one of four additional roads to be
included as part of the Phase I World Bank projects (giving a total of 15 project roads).
Due to time limitations, no field investigations have been undertaken for the purposes of this
environmental assessment.  The description of the environment, potential impacts and
recommendations have been prepared as a baseline study using information from existing
literature sources, available mapping sources, knowledge of Provincial characteristics and
personal field observations from ANE technical staff.

2 BIO-PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
2.1 TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS
The Project road is located in the coastal region of Nampula Province with a topographic relief
ranging 0 - 200 m above sea level. The road traverses relatively flat terrain and intersects
several small rivers towards the EN 260, and as the road moves further from the coast towards
Nametil, the topography inclines and the terrain is gently undulating.
2.2 CLIMATE
The climate within the Nampula province is classified as dry sub-humid and has two climatic
seasons namely a hot and humid rainy season between December and March, and a cooler and
drier season from April to November. The mean annual monthly temperature averages vary
between a low of 210C in July, and a high of 27.5 C in November. Monthly maximum and
minimum average temperatures range between 29.5-32C and 15-19 respectively (Figure 1).

2.3 GEOLOGY
Geological formations of the Pre-Cambrian period (more than 600 million years BP) cover
most of the area. The most important formations comprise granitoid migmatites (rich in
quartz) and in the Nampula super-group two major complexes can be distinguished, namely:
o Gneissic migmatites (P): which cover the major portion of Zambezia Province and include
biotites and amphibolites.
o Granitic migmatites (y): which are important mineralogically and include quartzites,
marble and graphite.
A great portion of the study area is comprised of acidic rocks due to their percentage quartz
content and the soils derived from these are typically sandy. The area is characterised by a
slightly undulating plains. The major geological features of the region are depicted in Figure 4
below.
Sedimentary formations of the Quaternary period, comprising of alluviums and sandy
eluvium's are found as the road approaches nearer the coast just before Boila.

2.4 SOILS
The Nametil road predominately passes through red sandy clay loams, brown sandy clay soils
and sandy colluvium soils. A description of the soil types is given in Table I and the
distribution of these soil types along the road is illustrated in Figure 5.
The soils are characteristically fertile deep soils of medium texture and have generally poor to
moderate drainage. The structure of the soils originating from acidic rocks is generally weak to
very weak in sandy soils and weak to moderate in soils of medium to heavy texture.

2.5 LAND USE
The road -predominantly passes through woodland and thicket that has been disturbed for
anthropogenic purposes such as cultivation and settlement. The first 16 km of road from
Nametil passes medium thicket with approximately 45% vegetation cover then the next 35 km
predominantly passes an area of herbaceous species which has been mostly altered as a result
of agriculture. The road then passes through a relatively disturbed area of small shrubland for
8 km which has approximately 50% cleared for small fields and cashew groves before passing
12 km of medium thicket which has been highly disturbed. The last 10 km has mixed
regenerating vegetation of thicket and open forest which has approximately 5% of the area
cleared for cashew trees and small fields.
The project road traverses a highly populated area of the Nampula Province that has an average
population density of 66 people per km2 (compared to the National average of 22 people per
kM2). The road is connected to the provincial capital of Nampula, the major town of Nametil
and the coastal port town of Angoche. Angoche was once an important fishing port that is
planned for rehabilitation. The location of the road connecting these major centres has an
economic potential for the area as it traverses an important agricultural area where cashew,
cotton, tobacco and coffee are produced. No major industries are known to occur adjacent to
the road.
2.6 RIVERS AND WATER QUALITY
The road south of Nametil runs parallel to the MeMlie River, lying to the west, for
approximately 16 km south of Nametil. The road crosses several small rivers along its route,
with the major ones including Elepue, Luazi, Xilapane, Mupricomo and Chitalane Rivers. The
last three rivers mentioned are crossed by the southern section of the road near Boila and
drains into the Muchupe River and enters a large bay joining the Luazi River near Angoche
before flowing into the Indian Ocean.
2.7 NOISE AND AIR QUALITY
Noise levels along the Nametil Project Road, are expected to be very low due to the currently
low traffic noise and sparse settlement along the route.  The noise levels would be
predominantly generated by natural conditions (i.e. from insects and birds), however noise
would increase slightly as the road passes the larger settlements, particularly near the market
areas.
Ambient air quality along the project road is expected to be good due to a lack of air polluting
industries and urban activities, typical of other project roads inspected within the Nampula
Province. Haze may be observed due to practiced slash and burn agriculture and production of
charcoal, which are frequently practiced in the Province. Levels of airborne dust generated by
winds can also be higher over agricultural fields, as can smoke from forest and grassland fires.

2.8 VEGETATION COVER
The stretch of the project road between Nametil and EN260 traverses Moist Savanna to Mesic
Forest characterised by an annual rainfall of >1000 m. The broad vegetation type of the area is
tardily deciduous miombo, lowland type, and the project road traverses the subtype
characteristic of Nampula Province, which includes the Brachystegia spiciformis, B.
boehmii-Adansonia, Sterculia type. (Equivalent to Mapping Unit, 27 Wild and Barbosa,
1967)
This Vegetation type overs the subplanaltic zone between 50 and 500 m. especially in the
sublittoral areas from Angoche to Nampula and traverses soils which are generally red to
grey and derived from granite, gneiss or rocks of the primitive system.
This mosaic include the following communities:
(i)    Closed woodland 12-18 m. high of Brachystegia spiciformis, B. boehmii and
Julbernardia globiflora. In wetter woodland occur elements of the Pteleopsis
myrtifolia forest of sublittoral areas (see Type 2). Sometimes comnmunities with
abundant Brachystegia utilis occur (approaches Type 23).
(ii)   Scattered  patches of deciduous forest with Adansonia digitata, Bombax
rhodognaphalon, chlorophora excelsa, Sterculia appendiculata (very typical of
these communities), Dialium holtzii, Cordyla africana, Croton megalocarpus, etc.
(Type 49).
(iii)  Savanna woodland of medium height with Brachystegia boehmii (dominant),
Julbernardia globiflora, Erythrophleum africanum, Pterocarpus angolensis, etc.,
Brachystegia allenii is often represented in shallow or sloping soils (approaching
Type 29).
(iv)   Tree-shrub savanna in the lower lying areas with Acacia polyacantha subsp.
campylacantha, A. nigrescens, A. sieberana, Combretum spp., Kigela pinnata,
Ficus sp., Terminalia sericea, etc. Grass layer of Setaria, Pennisetum, etc. soils
grey.
(v)   Deciduous  savanna  or woodland  with Adansonia, Sterculia, Dalbergia,
Commiphora, etc. at the foot of 'inselbergs' with an abundance of Oxytenanthera
abyssinica bamboo thicket. Sometimes the dwarf Androstachys jhonsonii also
occurs in swallow soils near the 'inselbergs'. Soils red.
There are no designated production forest areas within the ROI of the Project Road.

2.9 WILDLIFE AND CONSERVATION AREAS
There are no designated conservation areas or Coutadas (hunting areas) located within the
project road ROI. The area has been highly disturbed for agricultural purposes and therefore
the diversity and species numbers in the area are expected to be low.
The mammal population within the ROI is expected to be sparse as there are only eighteen
mammal species known to occur within the reserves of Nampula Province and over the last
few years, there has been a considerable reduction in wildlife numbers due to hunting and
habitat pressures. It is believed that most of the species are locally extinct and even the small
solitary forest-dwelling antelope (suni and duiker) have been eradicated.

3 SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
3.1 PROVINCIAL CHARACTERISTICS
The purpose of this section is to describe the socio-economic environment for the road
between Nametil to the Corner of the EN 239 and EN 260 in Nampula Province. Information
has been derived from existing reports and publications where information is disaggregated
usually at the Provincial and District levels.
To describe the living conditions for the populations living along or in proximity to the
Nametil road a variety of Provincial and District socio-economic indices have been used.
Where possible statistical information has been provided to enable the establishment of base
line data from which the impacts of road improvement may be made.
3.1.1    Context and administration
i   Provincial setting and administration
Nampula Province is located in the Central Region of Mozambique. To the north of Nampula
Province are the Provinces of Niassa and Cabo Delgado. Bordering to the south is Zambezia
Province and the eastern boundary is formed along the Indian Ocean.
Administratively Nampula is divided into 19 Districts, 71 Administrative Posts, and 103
Localities. The Provincial Capital Nampula, Angoche, and Nacala-Porto are designated as
cities. In terms of area, Nampula is the third largest Province in Mozambique with a land
surface of 81,606 Km2 representing 10.2% of the land surface of Mozambique.
ii   Political environment
In the 1999 elections the RENAMO political party received the majority of the votes cast in
Nampula Province. Political tension exists to the extent that RENAMO believe they should be
allowed to select a candidate as Governor of the Province to reflect their electoral superiority.
The issue of the political allegiance of the Governor is currently vigorously debated in
Mozambique.  Demonstrations in Nampula City against the general elections of 1999
organised by RENAMO resulted in the deaths of two demonstrators.
iii   Traditional administration
Traditional administration authority exists in Nampula Province, although in some Districts the
links between traditional authorities and formal administrative authorities are weak. The
importance attached to the regulos varies from area to area. In those localities where the
regulos are strong and respected he will intervene in a variety of aspects of every-day life.
Such issues would include resolving social conflicts; allocating land for building housing,
managing water sources, supporting official health programmes such HIV/AIDS.

IMIPA CTO Lda                                                      NSA EG
Like most parts of Mozambique, tensions exist between the two types of administrative
systems. These tensions were exaggerated during the armed conflict. Areas controlled by
RENAMO largely reverted back to traditional leadership structures, while those under
Government control retained their post-independence organisational structures.
3.1.2    Population Characteristics
i   Population
The 1997 national survey estimated the population of Nampula to be 2,975,747 inhabitants
with slightly more women (1,495,822) than men (1,479,925). Nampula is Mozambique's most
populated Province. The annual population growth rate is estimated at 2.2% and therefore by
2009 it is calculated that the population will have grown by 34% to about 3,900,500.
The population of Nampula Province is young with more than 1.3 million peoples under the
age of 14 representing 43% of the total population. The population density for Nampula
Province (36.4 inhabitants per km2) is higher than for the average population density for the
country (19 inhabitants per kmi2). The total urban population is calculated at 743,638 and the
rural population at 2,232,109. In comparison to other Provinces Nampula has a relatively high
urban-rural ratio with approximately 1 in 3 people living in one of the three designated cities.
ii   Ethnicity
The main ethnic group of Nampula Province is the Mecua. The languages spoken reflect the
dominant ethnic group and the three most common languages are Emakhuwa (91%), Coti
(1.9%), Elomwe (0.4%), and Portuguese (5.6%).
iii   Gender
The main ethnic group the Mecua are patrilineal meaning that inheritance follows the male
linage. Despite the advancement of the rights of women under independent Mozambican
administration, girls and women in Nampula Province do less well than boys and men. Access
to health services directed specifically at women is generally very poor. Literacy rates for
women are much lower than for men. Family law in Mozambique still discriminates against
women. A married woman has limited rights to make independent economic decisions or
enjoy full ownership of assets, and a widow's rights to inheritance are secondary to males in
the family. Girls in rural areas in general marry young often as soon as they reach puberty.
3.1.3    Economic Characteristics
i   Economy
The economy of Nampula was estimated to have generated approximately US$460 million
between 1996 and 1998 representing approximately 13% of Mozambique's annual output.
Agriculture is the main activity contributing about 40% by value. The category of fishing

contributed 8.5%, commercial activity 13.1 %; transport and communication contributed 9% by
value and manufacturing 7% by value. Recent agreements for the mining of titanium will have
a dramatic impact on investment and production for Nampula Province. In 1998 gross
domestic product per head was calculated at $176 with an annual growth rate projected as
15%.
ii   Poverty
According to the National Poverty Assessment (1996-97) 68.9 % of the population of Nampula
Province are categorised as poor. This equates to approximately 2 million people. This
compares with a national average rate of poverty of 69.4 %.
Life expectancy in Nampula Province (37 years) is below the average levels registered for the
country (42 years). Despite the relative high urban-rural ratio, the vast majority of the
population of Nampula Province (more than 75%) depends on agriculture, forestry and
fisheries for their livelihood, mostly comprising the family sector. There are few formal sector
employment opportunities except in the city of Nampula and Nacala.
3.1.4    Services
i   Education
In 1998 Nampula Province has a total of 1,117 schools: 1,061 lower primary (EPI) schools, 48
upper primary (EP2) schools, seven lower secondary, and one upper secondary (ESG2) school.
The number of students recorded was 286,649 and the number of teachers was 5,746. The
average ratio of pupils to teachers in the Province is 52.
ii   Health
Nampula Province has a total of 21 health units, including three hospitals, 43 health centres,
107 health posts and twenty first-aid posts. There are 54 maternity units distributed throughout
the Province.  The illnesses occurring most frequently in the Province are malaria,
tuberculosis, bilharzia, intestinal parasites, acute respiratory infection, AIDS, sexually
transmitted diseases and non-specific diarrhoea. Current rates of HIV infection are estimated at
approximately 21% and are projected to rise to 25% by the year 2010. It is calculated that
about half of all children under five-years suffer from chronic malnutrition and 1 in 10 from
acute malnutrition.
iii   Access to services
Access to services for the rural population is generally poor. Most villages do have a primary
school (EPI) (72%), but these schools could be categorised as rudimentary and often
availability of teachers is very low. Figures are not available for the provision of secondary
schools. Most villages do have access to a basic health centre but less than 1% of villages have
access to a doctor. Dependence on traditional healers is the norm for the vast majority of the
population and almost every village would have at least one person categorised as a traditional

3.1.5     Livelihood Strategies
The principle economic activity in Nampula Province is agriculture. Most food production is
within the family sector upon which the majority of the population is dependent. The principle
food crop grown is cassava (total production 2,451,576 tonnes) followed by maize (total
production 106,995 tonnes), and rice (22,321 tonnes). Crop production for Nampula Province
is shown in Table 3 below.

3.1.6     Archaeological and Cultural Sites
The road does not pass through or affect any known archaeological or cultural sites. Any
major rehabilitation work would necessitate consultation with the Chief the existence of any
cultural sites such as sacred forests.

3.2 DISTRICT CHARACTERISTICS
3.2.1    Context and Administration
This section describes socio-economic factors more specific to the EN239 Nametil to Cnr. En
239/260 road. The main sources of information relate to existing written reports concerning
the District the road passes through. To better assess the possible and probable impacts of
improvements to the EN239 Nametil to Cnr. En 239/260 road, more detailed studies for socio-
economic purposes will be needed.
3.2.2    District setting and administration
The EN239 Nametil to Cnr. EN 239/260 road passes through the districts of Angoche and
Magovolas located in south-eastern Nampula Province. To the north, Angoche District
borders with the Districts of Meconta and Mogincual. Mogovolas District borders with the
Districts of Morrupula, Nampula and Meconta.
3.2.3    Traditional administration
Traditional structure exists to a lesser or greater extent, in most localities side-by-side with the
more modern administrative apparatus of the State and political parties. In general terms, the
first government of an independent Mozambique from 1975 attempted to replace the inherited
colonial and traditional systems with a centralised system based upon the political doctrines of
socialism. However, some efforts are currently being employed towards incorporating
traditional leadership into the formal administrative systems.
Political Environment
The information available relating to voting practices in the Districts of Angoche and
Mogovolas indicates that the majority of the voting population voted in favour of the
opposition RENAMO party during the general elections of late 1999.

The 1997 national census estimated the population of Angoche District as 228,526 inhabitants
totaling 65,358 families and with a population density of 77 inhabitants per km2.
Magovolas District was recorded to have 182,184 inhabitants divided into 54,499 families and
with a population density of 23 inhabitants per kM2.
iii   Ethnicity
Most people living along the road are from the Macua ethnic group. Succession and heritage
for the Macua are patrilineal, and the children are considered to belong to the father. Family
succession is granted to the eldest son.

iv    Gender
Angoche District
On average women will be more illiterate than men, more boys than girls will attend school,
and higher rates of malnutrition are found for girls than boys. Some of the activities carried
out at household level such as subsistence farming and herding are broken down between men
and women.
Principal activities carried out by men include the clearing of trees, planting, harvesting and
the selling of products from the machamba. Men are also responsible for building the house,
producing crafts and on the coast, approximately 95% of the men fish.
Apart from farming, typical economic activities carried out by women include the selling of
products from the machamba while at the coast some families collect marine products. They
also fish using small nets. Generally, the land and property belongs to the husband and it is
him who covers all family expenses.
Mogovolas District
Inheritance follows a patrilineal system where belongings are passed from father to the son.
On average women will be more illiterate than men, more boys than girls will attend school,
and higher rates of malnutrition are found for girls than boys. Some of the activities carried
out at household level such as subsistence farming and herding are broken down between men
and women.
Principal activities carried out by men include the clearing of trees, planting, harvesting and
the selling of products from the machamba. Men are also responsible for building the house,
producing crafts and selling firewood and coal.
Apart from farming, typical activities carried out by women include the selling of products
from the machamba and activities such as pottery. Women are also responsible for most of the
domestic work. Generally, the land and property belongs to the husband but in some families
they belong to both.
v    Economy
The economy of the Angoche District is almost entirely based on agriculture but fishing plays
a secondary role. Whereas in Magovolas District the economy is almost entirely based on
subsistence agriculture.
vi   Poverty
Angochie District
The main period of poor nutrition is the period between October and March when crop stores
are at their lowest and before the new season's harvest. The nutritional status of the District is
considered reasonable. Shortages of food often occur in the coastal areas as a result of low
production yields but sometimes it occurs due to the excessive seeling of harvested crops. The

Mogovolas District
General deficiency in dietary terms for the Mogovolas District occurs in areas with low
agricultural production as a result of poor soils. Anaemia is one of the most common
conditions and health authorities say that cases are reported throughout the year. Problems
related to intoxication due to the poor preparation of cassava are not common in the District.
Categorizing families in terms of poor, medium and rich, surveys indicate that on average in
Magovolas District 80% of families are poor, 15% medium and 5 % rich. Table 5 below gives

3.2.4    Services
i   Education
Angoche District
According to the District Development Profiles, the district has 50 lower primary schools
(EPI) but the number of classrooms is not known. 261 teachers are allocated to the primary
schools with a ratio of 1 teacher to 46 students. Of the total number of students who attend
primary school, 70% are boys.
The next level of schooling is the upper primary school (EP2) teaching 6th and 7th grades.
Three such schools exist in the district at Angoche, Malatane and Ingure. Together the district
has 24 classrooms for this level of schooling. One secondary school is located in the district
capital. The school has 8 classrooms and provides education from the eight to the tenth grade.
In the District there are 296 teachers for 13,172 pupils. Teaching qualifications are varied: 185
teachers have sixth grade and an additional year of training, 47 teachers have grade six and
three years of training, four teachers have gth grade and two years of training, 11 teachers have
grade nine and three years of training, eight teachers have graduated from the Eduardo
Mondlane University as secondary school teachers, two teachers are expatriates and 85
teachers have received no training.
Mogovolas District
In the District of Mogovoals there are approximately 66 schools dsitributed in 12 localities.
They total 237 classrooms, a marked decrease form the 120 lower primary schools that existed
in 1982, with the consequence that no schools operate in the localities of Calipo, luluti and
Nanhupo-Rio according to available information.
No secondary school operates in the district. Upper level primary education (EP2) is taught in
just one school, in Nametil, which is also the district capital.
Approximately 231 teachers are posted at these schools. The majority of the teachers have
sixth grade (63 with one year of training, and 44 with three years), 25 teachers have undergone
no teacher training, 10 have ninth grade plus three years training, and two have higher level
courses. There are also 87 teachers who have had access to other, unspecified types of courses.
ii   Health
Angochie District
Angoche district has a total of 15 sanitary units including one rural hospital based in the
district capital. Three health centres are located in Namet6ria, Namaponda and Catamoio.
Further health posts can be found in Aube, Merrere, Natir, Napuma, Nacopa, M'papata,
Sangane, Angopesca, Maratane and Quiloa. On average, each health unit services 15,200
people who travel between I and 25 km to get to the nearest health unit.

According to the District Development Profiles compiled by UNDP and UJNHCR, only one
fixed vaccination post is known at Natir while three maternity units can be found at Aube,
Quilua Island and Natir. The district has the medical services of two doctors but no further
information was available on the staff in the remaining health units.
Mogovolas District
Information from the Ministry of Health indicates that there are four health centres in the
district. These are located in Nametil, Calipo, luluti and Muatua. Mogovolas possesses no
secondary level health unit. The distirct also has an additional three health posts, but only the
recently built one at Nanhupo-Rio has a maternity unit.
The administration of the Idsitrct says that community participation in health programmes is
significant, with the population assisting in the building of health posts using local materials,
as well as taking part in vaccination, nutrition and environmental health programmes.
However, the same source argues that the Mogovolas health network needs expansion to
ensure improvements in providing this kind of service. The needs of the district inlcude the
need to build two more health posts and three maternity wards as weel as the umprading and
expansion of the Nametil health centre.
iii    Key Social Services and Facilitates
While the District is relatively well served by primary (EPI) schools access to secondary
schools is poor. Availability of qualified medical staff is extremely low and most families are
dependent upon traditional healers to meet their medical requirements.
3.2.5    Livelihood
i   Livelihood strategies
Subsistence agriculture is one of the main activities of families living in Angoche and
Mogovolas Districts. The main food crops grown are cassava which occupies by far the
greatest crop area, followed by maize and sorghum.
Table 6 below shows total cultivated area by Crop (hectares) and total production
(tonnes/metric) for 1999/2000 for the district of Angoche. The District is not one with a
livestock farming tradition but many households keep ducks and chickens. The extent of the
agricultural activity is dependent upon several factors, notably:
o  The fertility of the soil
o  The availability of water
o  Availability of good pasture
o  The availability of supportive transportation linkages to facilitate trade
o  The availability of communication linkages to facilitate trade
o  Population densities
o  The availability of social services and amenities to support the population
o  The availability of supportive formal financial and credit institutions

ii   General characteristics of a family living along or in close proximity to EN239
Nametil to Cnr. En 239/260 road
Agricultural activities are carried out by the different members of the family who partake in
sowing, weeding and harvesting. Women are responsible for gathering fuel wood by chopping
down trees alongside men. Men also deal with crop storage. The agricultural produce grown
by the family is mainly used for own consumption but excess is sold in the markets of the
district capital or to traders who come from the provincial capital. It is common to find
families who use the same farmland every year and who do not leave the land fallow. The
main agricultural system is still based upon slash and bum techniques.
In the house women will look after the children, cook, clean the house, and would be involved
in most daily household activities. Men are responsible for construction and maintenance of
the house. The period of most work is between November and February, the main period of
cultivation and harvest. Women will control the household stocks of food while men will be
responsible for expenditure related to the children.

4 POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
4.1 IDENTIFICATION
This section provides an assessment of the potential environmental impacts associated with the
rehabilitation of the Nametil to EN 260 road works. Environmental factors considered were:
o  Land use change;
o  Erosion and sedimentation;
o  Water quality;.
o  Hydrology;
o  Noise and vibration;
o  Air quality;
o  Biological effects; and
o  Socio-economic effects.
Each of these issues is addressed in Sections covering the physical, biological and socio-
economic environments.
The majority of direct environmental impacts will be minor due to the limited extent of works
at any one site and the incorporation of impact mitigation measures into the improvement
works. The ENI currently has a sufficient and well defined road corridor which is identified
by ANE as 15m either side of the road centreline (Pieter Van Niekerk, pers. Comm., ANE,
November 2000).
Indirect effects, may result from increased natural resource use due to increased local
enterprise activity to service increased traffic. These impacts are anticipated to be relatively
minor due to the fact that the road is already well established as the major north-south access
route in southern and central Mozambique.
Many of the potential environmental impacts associated with the construction of a new road do
not occur to the same degree when a road is improved within the existing road corridor. The
most likely impacts include:
o Altered land use patterns due to improved accessibility, such as a change from forestry to
agriculture, or from agriculture to industry (Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997);
o  Public health problems, particularly through the spread of communicable disease (Birley,
1997); and
o  Increased illegal logging and poaching activities due to improved access into forest areas
(Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997).

4.2 PHYSICAL EFFECTS
4.2.1    Land Use
i   Construction
Ancillary activities are temporary activities required during the construction period and will
affect a relatively small land area. These sites will be selected in consultation with the
landowners and rehabilitated upon completion of activities. Ancillary sites will be located in
degraded areas, where possible, to ensure that large areas of land will not need to be cleared
and the change to land use is not significant.
Total land acquisition will be minimal relative to the project corridor length. Temporary areas
of land use change will occur as a result from establishment of ancillary sites such as batching
plant sites, borrow pits and workforce camp sites.
Where possible existing borrow areas will be utilised during the road works to avoid additional
disturbance. The rehabilitation of these sites after completion of the works will be undertaken
through revegetation and levelling the landform to its original condition. Where new borrow
pits are established these will be located at least lOOm from the road in accordance with
current ANE guidelines.
ii   Operation
The proposed road works will not have a direct impact on land use change outside the road
corridor. The extent of the road to be rehabilitated includes a length of 76km, which will be
maintained within the road corridor, and no realignments of the road are required. The
Nametil road is currently in a highly degraded condition and rehabilitation works will involve
a road formation width of 6 m wide.
The road is also located within a highly populated area of Nampula Province and crosses an
important agricultural area which has links to the provincial capital of Nampula, the major
town of Nametil and the coastal port town of Angoche. Encroachment of settlements and
cultivated subsistence farming within the road corridor may occur along some sections of the
road in which case the land use will change due to the road works. The impact is expected to
be minor and compensatory measures will apply as discussed in Section 3.3.
The road works will have a negligible effect on adjacent land use activities, as the area is
currently accessible however the road rehabilitation will improve the travelling time and access
of agricultural products to the major centres. This is may result in an indirect effect of
increased agriculture, market areas and additional roadside services such as Barracas (bars and
diners) and resting places, to service additional traffic. The number of new services is likely to
be minor as the existing traffic is low and the expected increase in the growth rate will not be
high enough to support a large number of new services.

iii   Mitigation Measures
Ancillary sites will be located in areas currently cleared or degraded, where possible, to ensure
that large areas of land will not need to be cleared and the land use is consistent to the area.
All ancillary sites will be rehabilitated upon completion of activities to their previous land use,
unless the facilities are further required. Rehabilitation and land forming of existing borrow pit
sites will result in an environmental improvement to the area.
Mitigation measures for other temporary facilities include:
o Measures identified under socio-economics for selection and negotiation of use; and
o Rehabilitation of all sites to their original condition, or better, to allow resumption of prior
land use.
4.2.2    Erosion and Sedimentation
i   Erosion Hazard
The dynamic interplay of several key factors dictates the degree of susceptibility to water-
driven soil erosion processes. These are:
Li Seasonality and intensity of rainfall in relation to water run-off;
o Landscape topography in relation slope gradients;
o Soil profile parameters, notably depth and binding properties;
o Degree of vegetation cover; and
o Magnitude and frequency of seismic events.
For road works in general, where the capacity of existing drainage works to manage water run-
off is exceeded then the interaction of the above factors will determine the extent and
magnitude of erosion processes. These considerations provide the basis to determine the
overall erosion hazard.
The rating for erosion risk has been determined from the Mozambique Erosion Hazard Map,
1:2,000,000 produced by the Soil and Water Conservation and Land Utilization Co-ordination
Unit (1986).
The Nametil road predominantly passes through red sandy clay loams, brown sandy clay soils.
These soils are characteristically fertile deep soils of medium texture giving them a relatively
low erosion risk. The erosion hazard along the project road is considered to be low-medium
according to the erosion hazard mapping and the road does not pass along steep hilly terrain or
areas of high seismic activity therefore landslides and mass wasting issues are not of concern.
Erosion and sedimentation effects will be greater during the rainy period that occurs from
November to March. During this period 85 to 90 percent of the annual rains occur and erosion
potential will be highest. The impacts from construction will be minimal by limiting the area
of ground disturbance at any one site, and restricting works to the dry period.

Localised erosion can occur where soils are left exposed. This is commonly observed on steep
unrehabilitated borrow pit batters where gully erosion is evident. Similar problems can occur
on fill batters or other sloped areas.
ii   Sedimentation Risk
Sedimentation is a secondary process of erosion and can be exacerbated by road works due to:
o deliberate and unanticipated modifications to surface and ground water hydrology;
o incomplete rehabilitation of roadside verge areas; and
o road rehabilitation throuwh naturally hilly terrain.
Ground disturbance and the temporary stockpiling of materials during road works can trigger
uncontrolled and or accelerated sedimentation processes. The onset of this process will be
coincident with ground disturbance and will continue up until sites have been stabilised in the
road works zone. The extent of ground disturbance and clearing along the road corridor will
be marginal, with an average width of 16m disturbed during the construction stage. The
potential for sedimentation will be higher during times of heavy rain where the road becomes
submerged due to localised flooding from the drainage lines.
Other areas where ground disturbance and clearing is required during the construction stage is
at stockpile areas, borrow pit sites, construction camps, and work compounds. The fill
required for the road works will be obtained from existing borrow sites or degraded areas
where possible to minimise the need for additional ground disturbance.
The terrain along the project road is gently undulating and therefore the potential for erosion
from the improvement works is not significant. The soil types intersected by the road have a
moderate soil erodability rating with reference to sheet erosion potential (Wambeke, 1986).
There are no areas where significant cut and fill is required and retaining walls will not be
required. The need for road embankments will be minimal and will not create sedimentation
problems if vegetated properly and formed on 1:2 grades.
iii   Mitigation Measures
The impact from sedimentation will be minimised by avoiding stockpiling of materials near
drainage lines and by not undertaking construction during times of heavy rain, particularly the
months of December to March.
Minor reconditioning of the existing culverts will be undertaken where their discharge is
causing downstream erosion. Specific measures for erosion and seiiiment control include:
o  design of drainage works to ensure these collect from and discharge to natural drainage
lines. This may not always be possible for mitre drains and in those situations frequent,
low volume drains are preferred;
o  provision of energy dissipation devices where discharge velocities and flows will erode
downstream drainage lines;
o  minimisation of disturbed areas;
o  design and construction of erosion and sedimentation controls such as diversion banks,
filter structures (filter fences or windrowed vegetation) and sediment traps;

Li diversion of significant upstream flows around working areas; and
o  undertaking progressive rehabilitation and revegetation of all slopes and disturbed areas.
In addition, temporary erosion control drains will be installed prior to the wet season and no
new road excavation will be commenced during the wet season.
The installation of side drains and culverts along the road will minimise sedimentation and
runoff effects during operation of the road.
4.2.3    Water Quality
i   Construction
The potential for sedimentation from construction activities is described in the previous section
and will have an impact on water quality. The rates of sedimentation will be higher during the
rainy season therefore construction impacts will be minimised by undertaking works during the
dry season, particularly near perennial streams. The occurrence of sedimentation in permanent
watercourses will have a greater effect during the dry season when flows are low.
Hydrocarbons sourced from improper disposal facilities for used lubricants and poor operation
and maintenance practices for construction vehicles and machinery can contaminate surface
waters. Improper disposal of oil filters and other materials from vehicle and machinery
maintenance can also cause pollution. This can occur during both construction and road
operation, but mostly during the former.
Spilled petroleum fuel, as well as bitumen and explosives residue, also have a potential to
contribute to the pollution of waterbodies, but to a very minor extent.
Improper sanitation and waste disposal procedures in temporary construction camps can also
contaminate water resources.
ii   Operation
Borrow areas have the potential to result in adverse environmental impacts if they are not
rehabilitated correctly. If left in a poor condition water can collect in the depressions created
and become weed infested as well as providing optimal breeding conditions for insect vectors
of parasitic diseases such as malaria
iii   Mitigation Measures
Proper management of construction camps is required to prevent pollution to neighbouring
waterways. Any pollution resulting from these camps shall be remediated immediately.
All fuels, lubricants and bitumen will be stored in bunded areas. Vehicle maintenance and
refuelling will be confined to areas in construction camps designed to confine lubricants and
fuel spillages.

Adequate waste disposal and sanitation facilities will be provided at construction camps. Any
wastewater or stormwater discharged from the site shall comply with the following objectives:
o  pH range                         6.0-9.0
L  Total Suspended Solids (TSS)    <50mg/I
o  Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)    <1500mg/I
o  Oils and surfactants             No visible film of oils or petrochemicals
The Contractor shall ensure that all bitumen and fuel storage areas shall be bunded to contain
at least 120% of the maximum capacity of the largest storage tank. The floor of the bunded
area shall be impervious, and storage facilities and bunds shall be inspected weekly for spills.
4.2.4    Hydrology
i    Construction
The road works will have a negligible impact to hydrology, as the rehabilitation works will be
undertaken along an existing alignment. The main construction activity that has the potential
to impede flows will be the stockpiling of materials if placed near drainage lines.
ii    Operation
Although the road is an existing feature, it can cause an impedance to flow, alter the natural
channel position and result in increased velocities as a result of this change. The road crosses
five major watercourses, which will require the provision of adequate sized culverts. The
provision of culverts along the road have been determined for engineering purposes as a
measure for protecting the road structure and they are therefore not within the scope of this
study.
Adequate and stable cross-road and road surface drainage is essential to ensure that storm
runoff across the road causes minimal damage to the road and minimises the effect of
inundation caused by impeded flows. Cross-road drainage shall be provided by causeways and
culverts to pass catchment flows past the road, either over or beneath it. Road surface drainage
shall be provided by side drains to direct runoff off the road surface.
iii    Mitigation Measures
Particular attention shall be given to stockpiling materials away from existing drainage lines
and avoid filling in wetland areas.
All designed drainage works shall be installed at the time of initial road construction to ensure
that flows along drainage lines are not impeded.
Culverts shall be laid in a direction, which is as close as possible to the natural position of the
drainage flow.  This will avoid altering the channel flow  and prevent upstream  and
downstream scouring of the watercourse.

4.2.5    Noise and Vibration
i   Construction
Some sensitive receptors, such as schools and hospitals, are located within 5-lOm of the ENI
road pavement. Additional noise will be generated along the ENI road corridors and at
ancillary sites during the construction period, particularly from the increased number of heavy
vehicles. Vibration effects will be negligible due to the generally sandy soil substrate. Peak
noise levels generated by construction activities are expected to be greater than the peak noise
levels from road operation.
Construction noise is generally intermittent and depends on the type of operation, location and
function of the equipment and the equipment use cycle. Noise attenuates quickly over
distance. Excavation noise levels, for example, assuming bulldozer and dump truck activity,
yield a level of approximately 85 dBA at 1Sm, but decrease by about 3-4 dBA with each
doubling of the setback distance, and would be reduced to approximately 70 dBA at about
240m.
ii   Operation
Accessibility will be improved after completion of the road works, and vehicle noise levels
may increase slightly with an expected increase in traffic growth. After completion of the
works, the traffic on the Nametil Road is expected to experience a high growth rate due to
improved accessibility (See Part B).
Noise sources and factors which may contribute to the increase in the ambient noise level and
related adverse impacts during the operation of the improved roads will include vehicle noise,
vehicle maintenance and driver behaviour (such as the use of horns).
The improved road design will allow an increase in vehicle speed and some increase in the
overall noise level is likely to result. When traffic speed doubles, this results in a 6 dB(A)
increase in noise level (Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997). The majority of the project roads
traverse open cultivated land and the impact from an increase in noise levels from increased
traffic speed will be minimal.
The road works may reduce existing noise levels in built-up areas as a result of improved road
surface. This will reduce noise levels through the more efficient operation of vehicles and less
noise from vehicle tyres.
As ambient noise levels are generally lowest at night, the impact from traffic noise is expected
to be greater during these hours.
iii   Mitigation Measures
No national noise level standards currently exist for highway construction equipment in
Mozambique, however the World Bank recommends the use of construction equipment, which
meets international standards.
58602 Annexure E - Nametil to EN 260 Road    January 2001                    4-7

The following measures shall be implemented to minimise the impact of noise during the
construction phase:
o Work compounds shall be located at least 0.5km from settlements;
o In construction sites within 150m of residential areas, construction shall occur between
19:00 and 06:00 hours; and
o Maintenance of machinery and vehicles shall be undertaken and repaired regularly to keep
noise at a minimum.
4.2.6    Air Quality
i Construction
The deterioration in air quality from dust generation and vehicle emissions during road
construction and operation will be a relatively minor environmental impact. Significant
adverse effects are not expected because of the limited duration of construction at any one site
and the few receptors. Most of the work will occur in open, cultivated areas.
Deterioration in air quality during road construction will be experienced primarily from dust
generated by road works, spoil transportation and disposal. Construction will be primarily
labour based, with excavation and material transportation undertaken by hand, therefore dust
generation should be minimal due to the small area and volume of soil disturbance at any one
time. In addition, most construction activities will progressively move along the alignment, so
prolonged deterioration in air quality will not occur at any one site.
ii   Operation
Existing air quality is good and no significant air quality effects are expected during operation.
Traffic volumes are low and the road generally traverses rural road areas. Exhaust emissions
from traffic utilising the rehabilitated road are likely to increase due to an expected increase in
traffic growth. The emissions are still expected to be low because existing traffic numbers
currently utilising the road are relatively low.
Improved road geometry will reduce exhaust emissions along the project road by reducing the
roughness of the road surface (particularly by removal of potholes) increasing the design speed
and thereby reducing the need for excessive acceleration and deceleration (Tsunokawa and
Hoban, 1997).
iii   Mitigation Measures
Mitigation measures will be implemented in areas where air quality problems would arise due
to construction activities. Areas of concern for dust control are in major settlements and
sensitive sites such as schools and hospitals.

Minimising air emissions is particularly important during the construction stage, for activities
such as the operation of borrow pits and in-situ mixing of cement and sand, which have a
potential to generate high dust levels.
During the construction period, the following mitigation measures to suppress dust will be
implemented:
o  Water will be sprayed during the construction period at earth mixing sites, asphalt-mixing
sites, and on cleared surfaces. Water spraying will be undertaken during periods of high
wind, or when necessary, to suppress dust;
o  Operations shall be suspended during periods of dry windy weather, in areas where wind
blown dust is causing a nuisance in settlements or towns;
o  All equipment and plant machinery shall not emit visible smoke for a continuous period of
greater than 10 seconds, and
o  All exhaust systems and engines on plant and equipment shall be in accordance with the
manufacturers specifications and kept well maintained to ensure that they have a high level
operating efficiency.
4.3 BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS
4.3.1    Direct impacts
Vegetation will need to be cleared to undertake the road rehabilitation works and enable road
formation widening and construction of additional drainage. The conservation value of the
road corridor vegetation that will be cleared is not high. The woodland areas crossed by the
road corridor are highly utilised, particularly for slash and burn agriculture, which is frequently
practiced in the Province. The amount of clearing that will need to be undertaken will be
minimal, as the road corridor is well defined for the majority of its length. The impact of any
clearing required for the road projects will not be significant due to the already highly
degraded nature of the woodland habitat.
Vegetation may also be cleared in areas selected for ancillary sites, such as construction
camps, borrow pits and quarries, to enable the utilisation of these areas.
There are no known wildlife crossings along the length of the road project and the habitat has
been highly modified by anthropogenic uses. The road works have no potential for significant
adverse effects on wildlife.
4.3.2    Indirect impacts
There is a potential impact associated with the indirect loss and degradation of vegetation,
habitat and species in the ROI. These potential impacts are associated with:
o Improved access;
58602 Annexure E - Nametil to EN 260 Road  January 2001                        4-9
Mozambique Road Sector EIA             DRAFT



IMPA CTO Lda (lItSaEC
o In-migration; and
Li Construction workforce behaviour.
Ecological degradation of the ROI may occur from vegetation harvesting and wildlife
poaching by the construction workforce, and increased harvesting during road operation due to
greater accessibility and additional local demands from road-induced activities.
The projects will provide improved access to the neighbouring areas and facilitate natural
resource use. The main potential for increased natural resource harvesting is likely to occur
within the area's woodlands.
The population increase along the road corridor would be derived either from people migrating
to the roadside from the immediate area (i.e. the 5km region of influence and adjacent to this),
or from other areas. This in-migration has a potential to create an increased local demand for
fuelwood and construction timber, as well as other woodland products to support secondary
enterprise activities, such as forage collection for grazing animals. Hunting may also increase.
The proposed road improvements will follow an existing alignment and almost all forest areas
neighbouring this road are currently accessible. The road will only increase potential access to
these forests, not open them up.
Importing a construction workforce into an area may increase demand on local natural
resources due to competition for firewood, woodland products and wildlife. These increased
demands will be focussed on the areas surrounding workforce camps and work compounds.
Worker camps may also encourage the temporary construction of markets and barracas to
service the workers. These temporary facilities may also increase demand on local natural
resources.
4.3.3    Mitigation measures
i   Direct Impacts
Vegetation clearance along the road edge and at ancillary sites (such as borrow pits) will be
minimised. All construction areas will be clearly marked and construction activity prohibited
outside the defined areas. Tress within ancillary sites shall be retained wherever possible.
Retention of trees within areas such as worker camps will improve the camp amenity and
provide shade.
All temporarily disturbed areas will be rehabilitated following construction. The establishment
of ground cover is the initial priority of revegetation. Ground cover reduces raindrop impact,
binds the soil surface and creates a micro-climate favourable for the establishment of other
vegetation. Species should be selected for cover crops and permanent revegetation. A cover
crop consisting of a rapid growing species and several vigorous grass species should be used to
rapidly establish ground cover on disturbed areas. Permanent revegetation species should be
selected to be consistent with the local native species in the area.
Revegetation will aim to stabilise the road verges and assist the many desirable secondary uses
of the road including:

o production of forage, wood, flowers, fruit, medicinal items;
o shade and shelter;
o fencing and screens; and
o building supports.
Revegetation along different sections of road will be designed to achieve site-specific aims,
such as maximising shade within villages and providing a species composition that is
compatible with surrounding vegetation cover.
ii   Indirect Impacts
The most potential for indirect effects was identified to be associated with workforce camps.
This is a temporary effect but may last several years depending on the duration of the works
project. To reduce the potential for increased exploitation of natural resources the following
migration measures will be implemented. The Contractor will:
o provide and maintain adequate drinking and bathing water supplies;
o provide kerosene or other fuel source and stoves for worker use;
o educate workers about the responsible use of natural resources; and
o ensure workers act in a responsible manner and apply penalties for the harvesting of local
resources (wood, wildlife or wood products).
4.4 SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
4.4.1    Direct impacts
i   Loss of agricultural land, buildings, sites of cultural value, population displacement,
and natural resources degradation
Improvements to the road will not involve the significant loss of cultivated land, major
buildings or require the displacement of the local population. Cultivation is not continuous
along the road and there is sufficient land for machambas if necessary to be realigned.
Land may need to be acquired for the purposes of borrow pits as a source for road building
materials. Negotiation with local authorities and farmers would secure access for borrow pits
and appropriate compensation established.
Where an area of cultivated land has to be resumed for road construction, the farmer should be
compensated for loss of production. The following process will be applied:
o where possible the farmer should be notified of the loss of land one season in advance.
This is to avoid unnecessary loss of effort and seed; and
o the value of the lost production should be determined in consultation with the District
Agricultural Officer and the local Chefe de Poste (Chief of the Post). Compensation will
be paid to the farmer for the value of the lost production.

Borrow pits, storage and equipment areas, and construction camps will be located on marginal
or disturbed land. The acquiring of land for such purposes must be subject to ANE and
Provincial appreval. In selecting land consultation must also be undertaken with local
communities and their traditional leaders as well as local authorities (at District and Ward
level).
4.4.2   Indirect impacts
i   Access to services
Improvement of the Nametil road is likely to have significant socio-economic impacts by
enabling better access to services such as better health services located in the Provincial capital
of Nampula.
ii   Improved access to markets
As the road is located within a rich agricultural area, the road rehabilitation is expected to
provide better opportunities for the local communities to transport surplus crop production to
Nampula City, Namialo and the port town of Nacala. These three major centres are within
easy distance of the road and offers a market for agricultural production.  Continued
improvement and maintenance to the road will enable goods and services to flow more easily
into the area particularly those associated with improving agricultural production techniques
and yields. A better quality of road would likely reduce transport costs both fuel consumption
and vehicle wear.
iii   In-migration of people and concessions
Improvement of roads in other rural areas within Mozambique leads often to increases in in-
migration as advantage is taken of the improved communication. It is probable that some in-
migration will take place particularly in areas in close proximity to Nampula, which currently
has the greatest population pressure. Regulos have an influence in terms of the local allocation
of land. Mitigating measures should involve working with regulos and other local authorities
to control any possible in-migration.
iv    Health issues
It is likely that the road project will necessitate the inflow of a number of construction workers
from other parts of Mozambique. The inflow of road gangs, particularly into remote areas has
a potential for adverse effects. The most often cited problem is the one of HIV-AIDs and
sexually transmitted diseases.  Mitigation measures against these likely impacts require
working closely with respective govemment departments; local NGOs and/or church based
organisations, local communities and road gangs. Educational programmes for the local
populations are considered to be extremely important in trying to reduce the likelihood of HIV-
AIDs infection.

v    Construction worker camps
The health issues related to construction worker camps particularly in -terms of the spread of
HIV-AIDs and other sexually transmitted diseases have been mentioned above.  A
concentration of workers also attracts other inward migrants who attempt to exploit new
market opportunities. In other parts of Mozambique this has often resulted in the creation of
small unplanned roadside shops. Such informal sites are often poorly managed in terms of
adherence to health regulations and waste disposal. Mitigation measures should include the
identification of suitable sites for the establishment of small shops and other facilities servicing
road-gangs.
vi   Recommendations
In conclusion road improvements and maintenance to the EN8 are unlikely to have any
significant socio-economic impacts. Maintaining the road in a good condition will encourage
farmers to explore marketing options for their surplus production and may encourage the
production of cash crops such as cotton.
The main negative socio-economic impacts relate to the problem of the spread of HIV-AIDs
infection. Campaigns in other parts of Mozambique have demonstrated that these problems
can be mitigated against, particularly if resources and education are directed at the local
population and not just the influx of construction workers.
Further studies are recommended to better predict probable socio-economic impacts, which
would occur as a result of the road rehabilitation.

5 ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION MEASURES
The road works will include environmental impact mitigation measures within the Contract
Specifications. These measures will be incorporated as specific instructions and
recommendations to the Contractor and will be provided in a separate Environmental
Management Plan (EMP). The EMP will identify specific instructions to the Contractor and
will include responsibilities, outputs, costs and timing of mitigation measures.
Design, construction and maintenance mitigation recommendations for the proposed roads
have been formulated to avoid or mitigate potential bio-physical impacts.  These
recommendations were primarily formulated from observations made during the inspection of
constructed roads.
The EMP describes the practical means to ensure effective implementation of the mitigation
measures recommended for the potential adverse environmental impacts identified in the EIA.
The EMP will include but will not be limited to the following elements:
o  Practical means to implement the recommended mitigation measures;
o  Implementation Schedule and Supervision Programme;
o  Monitoring and Evaluation;
o  Institutional Strengthening, Management and Training; and
o  Further Studies of Environmental Issues.
In addition, the program also specifies what action will be taken and by whom in the event that
the proposed mitigation measures fail, either partially or totally, to achieve the level of
environmental protection expected.
Specific socio-economic impact mitigation measures will include further consultation with
potentially affected landholders and provision of compensatory measures in accordance with
the current Government of Mozambique policy. These measures have been formulated by the
Department of Agriculture and include guidelines for the displacement of people and
acquisition of land for the roads.
An outline of the EMP for the construction and operation stage is provided in Part E of this
report.

MOZAMBIQUE ROAD SECTOR PROGRAM
ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY BRIEFING NOTE
The Administraccao Nacional de Estradas (ANE) has commissioned SMEC International, in
association with Impacto, to prepare an Environmental Study for the next Road Sector Program
for Mozambique (ROADS3).   This briefing note provides some details about the
environmental study to be undertaken.
The ROADS3 program aims to rehabilitate and upgrade portions of the Mozambique road
network over ten years (2000 to 2010). It is a further development of the Government's
Transport Policy. The program is divided into three phases:
L Phase I - 2001 to 2004 for confirmed and defined projects and interventions;
L Phase II - 2005 to 2006 for currently estimated projects and interventions; and
o Phase III - 2008 to 2010 for currently anticipated projects and interventions.
An attached figure identifies the roads to be examined.
The type of work to be undertaken falls into two broad categories, Periodic Maintenance and
Road Upgrading. Periodic Maintenance involves the following activities:
l where necessary widening the road to provide a minimum lane width in each direction of
3.2 metres;
constructing or improving the road shoulder (the formed part of the road to the side of the
travelling lane); and
o improving drainage including the table drains (the drains that run adjacent to the road and
remove water from the travelling surface) and culverts (the drains that pass beneath the
road).
Rehabilitation involves the same works as periodic maintenance but also includes
improvement or reconstruction of the road structure. A road consists of several layers of
material that form the road structure. These are usually referred to as (from bottom to top) the
sub-base, base and wearing courses. The wearing course can be either a select gravel or a
bituminous seal.
Funding is being sought from the World Bank for parts of the ROADS 3 Program. That part of
the program is subject to Environmental Assessment (EA) in compliance with requirements of
the World Bank and the Government of Mozambique. The EA will build on ANE's existing
environmental policy and legislation and the institutional framework developed during earlier
roads programs. The EA will contain two types of assessment, a Sectoral Environmental
Assessment (SEA) and an Initial Environmental Assessment (IEE), both conducted to World
Bank standards.
The SEA will examine the overall roads program proposed for the next 10 years. It will
include:

L  an overview of the environmental characteristics of Mozambique concentrating on those
areas potentially affected by the roads program;
L  a categorization of the road projects according to the potential significance of their
environmental effects. The environmental studies required for projects with a potential for
significant effects would be broadly scoped;
L  an overview of the environmental effects associated with the different categories of road
projects;
L  an assessment of the overall effects of the roads program; and
o an outline environmental management plan to eliminate or mitigate identified adverse
environmental effects.
The IEE will examine the specific projects to be undertaken as part of Phase 1 of the roads
program. An IEE is a limited type of environmental analysis focussing on specific impacts and
their mitigation. Their function is also to determine if further, more detailed assessment is
required.
SMEC will also produce two other documents for ANE:
L  Environmental Management Guidelines. These will be prepared from the:
- findings of the environmental assessment studies;
- analysis of the existing guideline documents used by ANE; and
-  SMEC's experience in preparing similar documents.
The guidelines will be directed at facilitating practical implementation of environmental
mitigation measures.
o  A Training Needs Manual. This will be developed from a monitoring and enforcement
analysis completed as part of the EA. It will specifically focus on the training needs of
ANE staff (including provincial offices) to assess, control and monitor environmental
impacts.

1 INTRODUCTION
This Annex contains an environmental assessment for one of four additional roads to be
included as part of the Phase I World Bank projects (giving a total of 15 project roads).
Due to time limitations, no field investigations were undertaken for the this environmental
assessment. The description of the environment, potential impacts and recommendations were
prepared as a baseline study using information from existing literature sources, available
mapping sources, knowledge of Provincial characteristics and personal field observations from
ANE technical staff.

2 BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS
2.1 TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS
The project road runs parallel and approximately 5km to the south of the southern shoreline of
lake Cahora Bassa over uniformly flat terrain at altitudes typically falling between 400 and
500m above sea level. It traverses an enormous number of seasonal watercourses draining in
to Cahora Bassa, mostly flowing from south-east to north-west.
2.2 CLIMATE
Lying in the inter-tropical zone, the area has a tropical and subtropical climate with two
seasons, wet and hot (November to March), and dry and cool (April to October). Drought
conditions are a frequent occurrence during the dry season.
The average annual temperature is 270 C, the coldest months June and July, and the hottest
months October and November (see Figure 1).

IMPACTO Ldlai                                                           ((:!SMIEC
The probability of extreme events (cyclones, floods) is minimal; over the past five years there
have been none. Overtopping the full supply level of Cahora Bassa can occur periodically
resulting in localised flooding along the lake shoreline. It is likely that sections of the project
road fall within this region of influence.
2.3 GEOLOGY
The road runs parallel and to the south of Lake Cahora Bassa in the Zambezi basin. The main
geological formations of the Zambezi River basin belong to the following units:
o Pre-Cambrian formations
o Overlying formations: Karroo and Post-Karroo
o Quaternary sedimentary formations
Pre-Cambrian formations occur extensively in the Tete Province especially north of the
Zambezi River where outcrops generally correspond to the large plateau, 800 to 1,500m high
best shown in the Zambue and Ang6nia regions in northern Tete Province. South of the
Zambezi, these same plateaux, 600 to 1,500m high, are located on the Catandica-Guro-
Gorongosa ridge area. The formations considered to be pre-Cambrian are composed mainly of
highly metamorphosed and folded sediments with which ancient-eruptive rocks are associated.
They are quite displaced, either due to major intrusions of basic and ultrabasic rocks or to
granitic intrusions of several ages although most of them have been emplaced during the upper
pre-Cambrian and some during the Palaeozoic.
The Karroo and Post-Karroo deposits occur north of the Zambezi river e.g., north of Cahora
Bassa but are better developed south of the Zambezi River. Karroo deposits outcrop in a huge
east - west band that stretches from Zumbo to the Sanangoe River. They also cover
considerable areas in the Moatize and Z6bue regions, north of the Zambezi River. The
outcrops correspond generally to major tectonic depressions inside the pre-Cambrian
formations and occur at heights ranging from 200 to 600m (See Figure 1). Post-karroo
deposits (lower to mid-Cretaceous) include the Magoe sandstones south of Lake Cahora Bassa.
The formations of the Quatemary - Recent zone (c. 3 million years to Recent) occur mainly in
the lower Zambezi, from Quelimane to Beira (most predominantly in the Zambezi Delta) and
penetrate inland far as Sena. Quaternary Deposits in the study area (Tete - Cahora Bassa) are
small and limited.
The Precambrian basement rocks of the Zambezi basin are overlain by sediments and lavas of
the Karoo Supergroup (between 160 - 225 m.y.) and by post-Karroo sediments. Associated
with them are large outcrops of volcanic and plutonic eruptive rocks revealing the intense
eruptive activity that took place during the Mesozoic.
Karroo Super Group
The sediments of the Karroo are of continental origin with dominance of tillites,
conglomerates, sandstones, shales and carbonaceous shales. They make an uninterrupted
outcrop from Chicoa village south-east of Lake Cahora Bassa to Zumbo at the headwater of
Cahora Bassa and northwards, along the Luangua River, as far as the Meze River (Ri and Rs).

Karroo sediments again appear to the west and south the Tete Complex, the latter between
Boroma and Tete. Ri (Ecca Group) comprise conglomerates, sandstones and schists and may
have coal bearing deposits. Rs formations are of the upper Karroo comprising conglomerates
and arcositic sandstone.
Post-Karroo Mesozoic Sedimentary Formations
The post-Karroo sedimentary deposits (lower to mid-Cretaceous of the overlying formations
are mainly sandstones. and conglomerates of the Magoe Formation (JK) inter-bedded with
mesozoic lava rocks.
Economically viable deposits of titanium, iron, copper, and zinc occur in the region serviced
by the project road.
The major geological formations in the region are depicted in Figure 2.

2.4 SOILS
The Magoe-Estima road passes through red clayey soils and shallow soils. The distribution of
these soil types along the road is illustrated in Figure 3 and a description of the soil types is
given in Table 1.
Both soil types originate from calcareous rocks and are characteristically reddish brown and
clayey. These soils are generally well to moderately well drained and of moderate depth.

2.5 LAND USE
2.5.1     Description
Along the Magoe-Estima road many medium sized settlements are found. These are generally
non-urbanized settlements. Magoe and Estima are the larger settlements found along the road.
Scattered homesteads mark the area away from the road. Small cultivated fields are scattered
throughout most of the area amidst herbaceous formations, which in some portions are
characterised by trees.
The vegetation is characterised mainly by open mopane and mixed baobab woodlands. There
is no known large-scale commercial exploitation of hardwoods in areas surrounding the Lake
(Direc,co Provincial de Agricultura e Pescas, Tete). Higher local population densities occur at
Estima, Nova Chicoa, Daque and Bawa on the south bank and at Zumbo on the north bank of
the lake. Local communities residing adjacent to the Lake use tree species listed in Table 2 for
subsistence purposes. Lakeshore fishermen smoke-roast a variety of fish species for sale in
Estima and Tete using mainly mopane as firewood.
There is little commercial sale of charcoal and firewood as access is poor for much of the area.

2.5.2    The Fisheries of Lake Cahora Bassa
There are two distinct fisheries in Lake Cahora Bassa. The first is a capital-intensive semi-
industrial fishery that takes the exotic kapenta, Limnothrissa nmiodon, which were introduced
into Lake Kariba in 1967-68 and later invaded Cahora Bassa. The second is the inshore fishery
operated by the local people that take a variety of native species.
i   The Kapenta Fishery
This fishery has grown rapidly in the last few years and the annual catch is now around 10,000
tonnes. There is some concern about its sustainability and potential yield.
The kapenta in Lake Cahora Bassa, like those in Kariba, are small and probably have a 6-9
month life cycle. Because few fish survive to the age of 9 months, mortality rates are
extremely high although there is some debate over their exact magnitude.
The short life cycle of these fish, and their consequent high mortality, has important
implications for the fishery. In Kariba, and probably also in Cahora Bassa, kapenta become
sexually mature when they are about 3 months old (about 35 mm long). These mature fish will
then live, on average, for about another 3 months. The fishery is therefore taking fish, which
will shortly die in any case, and fishing mortality simply substitutes for natural mortality. This
contrasts to the situation in longer-lived fish species where fishing mortality is additional to
natural mortality. This means that it is theoretically possible for the fishery to take the entire
annual production of kapenta without affecting the parent stock.
ii   The inshore fishery
This fishery is based on the native Zambezi River fish, which live in the relatively shallow
inshore waters . Relatively little is known about the biology or abundance of these fish in Lake
Cahora Bassa.
Most of the fishermen living around the lake are involved in the artisanal fishery; most of them
are poor and the fishery is unsophisticated. Dugout canoes are used almost exclusively and
gillnets are the only fishing method employed in this fishery. It is most unlikely that any other
fishing gear will ever be used. The drowned trees and very rocky shoreline prevent the
employment of methods such as beach seines or trawls. The use of longlines has been
suggested and they have been tried previously with some success but are not now used to any
significant extent. The loss of hooks on the drowned trees would probably discourage most
fishermen from attempting this method.
About 39 species of fish have been recorded in the area of the lake but few of them will be of
much economic importance. Only four species are of importance in the fishery: Bottlenose,
Mormyrus longirostris (local name "n'bzio"); Tigerfish, Hydrocynts vittatus ("inchene");
Chessa, Distichoduts schenga ("tchenga"); Kariba tilapia, Oreochromis mortimeri ("pende")
and the African catfish Clarias gariepinuis ("mulamba"). Additional species noted in the
catches include Hippopotamyrus discorhynchus ("nhakaboi"), Brycinus imberi ("mbele") and
Tilapia rendalli ("pende"). Some other species, notably Labeo altivelis ("tsimbo"), would be
expected in the more riverine regions in the western part of the lake.

IMPACTO Lda                                                             jI.wSEC
The artisanal fishery is centred on numerous fishing villages scattered around the lake; some of
them are relatively large villages with permanent populations but others are simple
encampments.
Attempts to develop community-based management of natural resources have begun through
the Tchuma Tchato program (discussed in a later section) , which has been most successful so
far in the western part of the lake among the Bawa community. So far, this program has been
largely concerned with wildlife management and has not evolved into a fisheries management
project. Nevertheless, it is hoped that fisheries will become part of this programme in time and
that a linkage between the kapenta industry, the inshore fishermen and the local community
will develop to the benefit of all parties.
2.6 RIVERS AND WATER QUALITY
The project road traverses many seasonal watercourses draining in to Cahora Bassa, mostly
flowing from south-east to north-west . The major watercourses from east to west are the
Nhacapiriri, Muze, and Daque Rivers. All these watercourses are seasonal, and only flow
during the summer rainy season.
The lake covers an area of approximately 266,500ha (top storage level). The dam itself was
constructed between 1966-1975. The maximum length of the lake is 246km, and maximum
width is 39.8km.
The Zambezi enters Cahora Bassa at Zumbo (1536'S, 3030'E). The bulk of the water
entering the dam comes from the Zambezi, but in addition, there are 20 north shore, and 36
south shore affluent streams. The north shore catchment is approximately 16,000 km2 in
extent and none of the streams are perennial. The south shore catchment is substantially larger
(40,966 kM2) and two rivers are perennial (Hunyani and Messenguezi Rivers). The road does
not traverse these rivers.
2.7 VEGETATION COVER AND USE
Between Estima and Magoe the road traverses three broad vegetation types:
1. Mopane Woodland (Colophospermum)
2. Mixed Baobab Woodland (Adansonia, Sterculia, Kirkia, Cordyla, Acacia)
3. Dry Deciduous Miombo (Julbernardia)
Mopane Woodland is the co-dominant vegetation type. (Mapping Unit 35, Wild & Barbosa
1967).
Mixed Baobab Woodland is the other co-dominant vegetation type along the project
road (Equivalent to Mapping Units 49 & 56, Wild and Barbosa, 1967).
Dry Deciduous Miombo (Jutlbernardia globiflora) restricted to the vicinity of Estima
(Mapping Unit 30, Wild & Barbosa 1967).

I,PACTO Lda                                                              w(iwsMEC
i   Mopane Woodland
(Mapping Unit 35, Wild & Barbosa 1967).
Mopane woodland, after miombo woodland, is the second most important woodland type in
Mozambique. Mopane covers large areas in the Zambezi Valley (Tete Province) and the
valleys of its tributaries from Lupata to Zumbo below 400 m. The annual rainfall is 500-
700mm.
In the Zambezi valley the Colophospermum mopane woodland is usually medium or tall (10-
15 m.), almost pure but with some Adansonia digitata. The soils are brownish, clayey,
compact, with some calcareous material, relatively deep and mainly derived from Karroo
formations. In pans and depressions with calcareous soils, grassland with Setaria sp. is
dominant.
In shallow, stony and also calcareous soils Acacia nigrescens (subdominant), Dalbergia
melanoxylon, Acacia nilotica, Combretum ghasalense, Dalbergia boehmii, Adansonia digitata,
Albizia harveyi, Terminalia prunioides, T. stiihlmannii, Ziziphus mllcronata, Combretum
apiculatum, Afzelia quanzensis, etc. accompany the still dominant mopane. Associated shrubs
or perennial include Euphorbiaceae (Etuphorbia spp., Erythrococca sp.); Capparidaceae
(Capparis, Thylacium, Cadaba, Maerua); Acanthaceae (Barleria, Disperma); Apocynaceae
(Adenium); Liliaceae (Aloe, Sansivieria) and Salvadoraceae (Salvadora, Azima). The grass
layer is of tufted species such as Ischaemum glaucostachyum, Eragrostis spp., Aristida spp.,
Setaria sp., etc.
Mopane savanna woodland often grades into Julbernardia globiflora savanna woodland in drier
areas with poorer well-drained soils and into the Adansonia, Sterculia savanna domain.
On the banks of the Zambezi River the mopane is often replaced by Ziziphus mauritiana,
Diospyros mespiliformis and sometimes Berchemia discolor.
In small depressions there are savannas with shrubby Combretum ghasalense (generally
dominant) and Diospyros kirkii, Terminalia sericea, Acacia nilotica, A. spp., Lonchocarpus
capassa, Ziziphuis mucronata, etc.
ii   Mixed Baobab Woodland
(Mapping Units 49 & 56, Wild and Barbosa, 1967)
A formation of this bushland/woodland type comprising Adansonia digtata, Sterculia africana,
Kirkia acuminata, Cordyla africana, Sterculia apendiculata, Milletia stuhlmanni,
Lonchocarpus capassa, Otryoderris stuhlmanni,Sclerocarya birrea etc. occurs along a zone of
medium altitude (about 500 - 600m.) between the southern bank of the Zambezi River and the
Barue plateau north of Mungari on formations derived from granites and gneisses or from post-
Karroo lava (Equivalent to Mapping Unit 49, Wild and Barbosa, 1967).
This formation grades into (eastwards) a dry deciduous tree or shrub savanna (sub-planaltic)
comprising Adansonia, Sterculia-Acacia nigrescens, Pterocarpus brenanii-Diplorhynchus
(Equivalent to Mapping Unit 56, Wild and Barbosa, 1967).
58602 Estima - Mjgo6                January 2001                             2-10

This type is confined to Mozambique in an area between 200 and 400m. which is situated
between the Zambezi on the north-east, the Chiramba valley to the north and the Urema valley
to the soutlh-east.
Annual rainfall is about 600 to 800mm. The vegetation is a mosaic type with a tree savanna of
Adansonia digitata, Sterculia apendiculata, Afzelia quanzensis and Kirkia acumninata
associated with a scattered shrub savanna of Diplorhynchus condylocarpon, Pterocarpus
brenanii, Acacia nigrescens, Albizia harveyi, Terminalia sericia, etc. occurring on slopes and
gravelly patches. The grass layer consists of Hyparrhenia, Andropogon, Panicum, Urochloa,
etc.
In sheltered areas vestiges of dry dense forest including Millettia stuhlmannii, Cordyla
africana, Albizia versicolor, Ostryoderris stuhlmannii, Sclerocarya birrea, Kigelia pinnata,
Lonchocarpus, Dalbergia melonoxylon, etc. This type grades into a savanna type with Acacia
xanthophloea or A. polyacantha subsp. compylacantha, A. tortilis subsc. spirocarpa,
Combretum imberbe, C. microphyllum, etc. The grasslands in good seasons develop in low
lying areas bordering the ?tandos? with Acacia spp. and Piliostigma thonningii.
iii   Dry Deciduous Miombo
(Julbernardia globiflora) (Mapping Unit 30, Wild & Barbosa 1967).
A .Julbernardia globiflora type occurs in Tete Province and is widespread in belts between the
Brachystegia boehmii communities and the drier Colophospermum mopane savanna
woodlands. It is abundant on the Zambezi valley slopes from 400-700m. and in the lowlands
where the topography is irregular. Annual rainfall is about 800-900 mm and the soils are
orange to greyish. The following species in a decreasing order of frequency occur where
Julbernardia globiflora is dominant: Diplorhynchus condylocarpus, Terminalia sericea,
Brachystegia boehmii, Diospyros kirkii, Oxytenanthera abyssica, Colophospermum mopane,
Pterocarpus brenanii, Combretum ghasalense, Burkea africana, Piliostigma thonningii,
Pseudolachnostylis maprouneifolia, Acacia nigrescensis, Kirkia acuminata, Dalbergia
melanoxylon, etc. (Barbosa, 1958).

2.8 WILDLIFE AND CONSERVATION AREAS
The wilderness area from the Daque River (35km east of Magoe) west to the border with
Zimbabwe is under the control of Tchuma Tchato, a community-based sustainable natural
resource management initiative. A pilot project was started in Chintopo ward and due to its
success, rapidly expanded to include both Daque and Saiaris wards within the Districts of
Magoe and Cahora Bassa. Currently, Tchuma Tchato controls an area of approximately
9,250km2 mostly along the south-western shoreline of Cahora Bassa. The programme is
currently receiving funding from the Ford Foundation and the IDRC, and technical assistance
from the IUCN.
There are two permanent camps, one at Bawa and one at Daque. The Bawa camp is the more
established and has for the past three years hosted safari hunters and sport fishermen. There
are currently sixteen game guards working at Bawa and ten at Daque. Although no actual
censuses of wildlife numbers have been conducted the game wardens confidently stated that
poaching is decreasing and that populations of many important big game species are increasing
(based on more frequent sightings and new sightings in previously unoccupied habitats). The
only negative impact reported was an increase in habitat destruction by elephant.
Some of the large mammals believed to be increasing in number, and others of conservation
concern are listed in Table 3.

Over the last three years, approximately 33% of the revenue generated from safari hunting
(US$112,000) and sport fishing (US$38,000) activities have been redistributed among
participating communities. Tchuma Tchato's vision for the future is to be actively involved in
the development of ecotourism along the southern shoreline of Cahora Bassa and to promote
rural development (e.g. new schools, clinics and agricultural land) through their partnerships
with local communities.
The Ford Foundation has already invested US$500,000 in the project and will provide a further
US$280,000 for the setting up of an animal sanctuary over the next three years. The reserve
covers an area of approximately 2,500km2 and is home to numerous species of large mammals
(including the "big five", lion, leopard, rhino, elephant, and buffalo). Tchuma Tchato is of
critical importance if wildlife is to be effectively conserved in this area. The Province suffered
severe poaching during the war years. Community involvement in the Tchuma Tchato
programme has largely facilitated the re-establishment of game in this area.
2.9 NOISE AND AIR QUALITY
Noise levels along the Estima to Magoe Project Road, are very low due to the absence of
traffic noise and sparse settlement along the route. The noise levels are predominantly
generated by natural conditions (wind, insects, frogs, birds, etc).
Ambient air quality in all of the proposed road areas is very good due to a lack of industry and
urban activity.  Haze may be observed due to the frequently practiced slash and burn
agriculture and production of charcoal. Levels of airborne dust generated by winds or smoke
from forest and grassland fires can be high on occasion.

3 SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
3.1 PROVINCIAL CHARACTERISTICS
The purpose of this section is to describe the socio-economic environment in Tete Province.
Information was derived from existing reports and publications where information is
disaggregated usually at the Provincial and District levels.
To describe the living conditions for the populations living along or in proximity to the road a
variety of Provincial and District socio-economic indices was used. Where possible statistical
information was provided to enable the establishment of base line data from which the impacts
of road improvement may be made.
3.1.1    Context and Administration
i   Provincial setting and administration
Tete Province is located in the north western region of Mozambique and borders three
countries, Malawi to the east, Zambia in the north and Zimbabwe to the west. To the south of
Tete Province lies the Province of Manica. The shape of Tete Province as a peninsula
surrounded by foreign countries has influenced the economic, cultural and social links of Tete
with surrounding countries. The province also acts as a main corridor between the surrounding
countries.
Administratively Tete is divided into 12 Districts, with a Provincial Capital also called Tete.
Tete is the third largest Province in Mozambique with a land surface of 100,724km2
representing 12.8% of the land surface of Mozambique. Conversely it has the second lowest
population density at 11 people per km2.
ii   Traditional administration
Traditional administration authority exists in Tete Province. The importance attached to the
regulos varies from area to area. In those localities where the regulos are strong and respected
they will intervene in a variety of aspects of every-day life. Such issues would include
resolving social conflicts; allocating land for building housing, managing water sources and
supporting official health program such HIV/AIDS management.
Like most parts of Mozambique, tensions exist between the two types of administrative
systems. These tensions were exaggerated during the armed conflict. Areas controlled by
RENAMO largely reverted back to traditional leadership structures, while those under
Government control retained their post-independence organisational structures.

IMPA CTO Lda                                                            Q(qS NEC
3.1.2    Population Characteristics
i   Population
The 1997 national survey estimated the population of Tete to be 1,144,604 inhabitants with
more women (595,674) than men (548,930). The country's annual population growth rate is
estimated at 2.2% and if that rate continues to 2009 it is calculated that the population will
have grown by 34% to about 1,533,769.
The population of Tete Province is young with more than 50% aged 14 or younger. The
population density for Tete Province (11 inhabitants per kmi2) is lower than for the average
population density for the country (19 inhabitants per kmi2). The total urban population is
calculated at 15% of the Provincial population In comparison to other Provinces Tete has a
relatively low urban percentage.
The population of Tete Province has experienced significant mobility over the last 40 years.
This has been associated with both the wars in Mozambique and also the Zimbabwe liberation
war. While most of Mozambique has experienced similar problems the people of Tete
probably experienced greater dislocation.
ii   Ethnicity
There are three main ethnic groups in Tete Province, the Nyanja (48%), Nyungwe (28%) and
Sena (12%). These percentages were based on the mother tongue of the people. Less than 3%
of the population speak Portuguese as their mother tongue.
iii   Gender
Despite the advancement of the rights of women under independent Mozambican
administration, girls and women in Tete Province do less well than boys and men. Access to
health services directed specifically at women is generally very poor. Literacy rates for
women are lower than for men. Family law in Mozambique still discriminates against women.
A married woman has limited rights to make independent economic decisions or enjoy full
ownership of assets, and a widow's rights to inheritance are secondary to males in the family.
Girls in rural areas in general marry young often as soon as they reach puberty.
3.1.3    Economic Characteristics
i   Economy
The economy of Tete is predominantly agricultural. Based on the percentage of people in
occupations the most important activities at the 1997 census were agriculture (90%), service
industries (5.5%), manufacturing (1.5%) and construction (1.4%).

IVPA CTO Lda IM"'OS IEC
There is a low urban-rural ratio, with a majority of people (90%) dependant on subsistence
agriculture for their livelihood. There are few formal sector employment opportunities except
in the city of-Tete.
ii    Poverty
Tete is one of the poorest provinces in the country with 82% classed as poor and 54% as very
poor. This compares with national averages of 69% (poor) and 38% (very poor).
Life expectancy in Tete Province is expected to be below the average level of 42 years
registered for the country.
3.1.4    Services
i    Education and health facilities
Information about the specific education and health facilities in Tete Province were not
compiled. Based on other roads studied for this project it is expected that:
o There will be few schools and the availability of education will decrease as a child ages.
The average ratio of pupils:teacher is expected to be in excess of 50:1.
Li Common illnesses in the Province are malaria, tuberculosis, bilharzia, intestinal parasites,
acute respiratory infection, AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases and non-specific diarrhoea.
o Current rates of HIV infection are in excess of 23% and are projected to rise. The central
region containing the provinces of Tete, Manica, Sofala and Zambezia has the highest rate
of infection in the country due to the presence of major transport corridors and proximity
to borders.
c Probably half of all children under five-will suffer from chronic malnutrition and I in 10
from acute malnutrition.
ii    Access to services
Access to services for the rural population is generally poor. Most villages will have a primary
school but these schools could be categorised as rudimentary and often the availability of
teachers is very low. Figures are not available for the provision of secondary schools. Most
villages will have access to a basic health centre but few have access to a doctor. Dependence
on traditional healers is the norm for the vast majority of the population and almost every
village would have at least one person categorised as a traditional healer.
3.1.5    Livelihood Strategies
The principle economic activity in Tete Province is agriculture and 90% of the population
listed agriculture, forestry or fishing as their main area of activity at the 1997 census. Forestry
and fishing activities are generally for personal consumption. Most food production is within
the family sector upon which the majority of the population is dependent. The principle food
crops grown are maize, sorghum and millet.

Livestock production is important to the well being of people in Tete. Most families will have
goats and a lesser number cattle. These animals are kept for reproduction and used as an
income source (money or barter).
3.1.6    Archaeological and Cultural Sites
The road does not pass through or affect any known archaeological or cultural sites. Any
major rehabilitation work would necessitate consultation with local administrative or
traditional leaders to identify any local cultural sites.
3.2 DISTRICT CHARACTERISTICS
3.2.1    Context and Administration
i   Introduction
This section describes socio-economic factors more specific to the ER555 Estima to Magoe
road. The main sources of information relate to existing written reports concerning the
Districts the ER555 Estima to Magoe road passes through.
ii   District setting and administration
The ER555 Estima to Magoe road road passes through the Districts of Cahora Bassa and
Magoe located in the central-south of Tete Province. To the north, Lake Cahora Bassa borders
both districts.
The ER555 Estima to Magoe road project road begins on the outskirts of Estima, within the
District of Cahora Bassa and continues into Magoe District where it ends at Magoe.
iii   Political Environment
No information is available for voting practices based in the two Districts. Tete Province
voted for both the ruling party FRELIMO and for the opposition party RENAMO during the
general elections of late 1999.
3.2.2    Population Characteristics
i   Population
The 1997 national census estimated that the population of Cahora Bassa District was 57,675
inhabitants, totaling 12,842 families. These are distributed in the three administrative posts at
Songo, Chitholo and Chitima.

The 1997 national census estimated that the population of Magoe District was 39,304
inhabitants, totaling 8,624 families. These are distributed in the three administrative posts at
Mpheende, Chinthopo and Mukumbura.
ii    Ethnicity
People living along the road are from the Nyungwe ethnic group (Cahora Bassa) and the yao
and Nyungwe ethnic groups (Magoe).
3.2.3     Economic Characteristics
i    Economy
The economy of the both Districts is almost entirely based on subsistence agriculture. Some
fishing also occurs on the southern shores of Lake Cahora Bassa.
ii    Poverty
The available data suggests that nutritional conditions in the Districts are improving. Cases of
malnutrition are not frequent although some cases do appear. Records of conditions such as
vitamin A deficiency and hyperthyroidism are often related to malaria cases. Many cases are
treated locally.
Categorizing families in terms of poor, medium and rich, surveys indicates some
differentiation between the Distrcts. On average within Cahora Bassa District between 85% to
90% of families are poor, 5% to 10 % medium and 1% to 5% rich. On average within Magoe
District, between 80% to 85% of families are poor, 10% to 15 % medium and 5% to 10% rich.
Table 4 gives examples of the characteristics of poverty for an average household in the
Districts.

3.2.4    Services
i   Education
a    Cahora Bassa District
The secondary school in Songo teaches grade 8 to 10. the school has 12 classrooms catering
for approximately 420 students who are taught by 10 teachers. An upper primary school (EP2)
is based in Songo and it also has 12 classrooms. There are 20 teachers for 810 pupils with a
teacher pupil ration of I to 41. Cahora Bassa district also has twenty lower primary schools
wehre two-hundred teachers provide education from I st to 5th grades to 6,900 pupils.
The majority of the teachers, approximately 63% of the total number of teachers, have 6'h
grade plus one or three years of training. Only 2.8% of the teachers attended University in
Maputo.
b    Mdgo& District
Magoe District has five lower primary schools which total 25 classrooms. The schools are
located in Mphende, Dack, Mukumbura, Chinthopo and Mussenguezi. Forty-seven teachers
provide education from the I st to the 5th grade. No secondary school exists in the district but
an EP2 school with three classsrooms was built in Mphende.
The majority of the 32 teachers working in the district have 6th grade andthree years of
training.
ii   Health
Cahora Bassa District has one rural hospital situated in the district capital that has 75 beds. An
additional three health centres are located on the plateau, in Estima and another in Chipira.
The latter has a maternity unit but no vaccination post. Two health posts are also located in
Chipanda and Nharapirini. An average of 11,000 people are serviced by each health unit and
the maximum distance that people must travel is 115km. The district posses a number of
medical staff, namely I middle level medical assistant, 24 basic medical assistants, 12
elementary medical assistants and 39 orderlies.
In Magoe District there are one health centre and six health posts. The district has 19 medical
technicians, nine of whom are elementary level technicians while the remainder have basic
level. On average, each health unit services 3,000 people and the maximum distance that
patients need to walk to get to such a unit is of 60km.
The most frequent diseases include diarrhoeas, malaria, dysentery and parasite-related
diseases. The latter are most frequent between the months of November through to March.
Other diseases diagnosed during the year are tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases.

iii    Key Social Services and Facilitates
While the Districts are relatively well served by primary (EPI) schools access to secondary
schools is poor. Availability of qualified medical staff is extremely low and most families are
dependent upon traditional healers to meet their medical requirements.
3.2.5    Livelihood
i   Livelihood strategies
Subsistence agriculture is the main activity of families living in the District. The main food
crops grown are maize and sorghum. Table 5 shows the total cultivated area by Crop
(hectares) and total production (tonnes/metric) for 1999/2000. While livestock production is
not very significant, pigs, chickens, cattle and goats are kept for household consumption, as
well as for the market. The extent of the agricultural activity is dependent upon several
factors, notably the:
a  fertility of the soil;
L  availability of water;
E  availability of good pasture;
a  availability of supportive transportation linkages to facilitate trade;
o  availability of communication linkages to facilitate trade;
L  population density;
o  availability of social services and amenities to support the population; and
o  availability of supportive formal financial and credit institutions

ii    General characteristics of a family living along or in close proximity to the ER555
Estima to Migoe road
Agricultural activities are carried out by the different members of the family who partake in
sowing, weeding and harvesting. Women are responsible for gathering fuel wood by chopping
down trees alongside men. Men also deal with crop storage. The agricultural produce grown
by the family is mainly used for own consumption but excess is sold in the markets of the

district capital or to traders who come from the provincial capital. It is common to find
families who use the same farmland every year and who do not leave the land fallow. The
main agricultural system is still based upon slash and burn techniques.
In the house women will look after the children, cook, clean the house, and would be involved
in most daily household activities. Men are responsible for construction and maintenance of
the house. The period of most work is between November and February, the main period of
cultivation and harvest. Women will control the household stocks of food while men will be
responsible for expenditure related to the children.
3.2.6    Archaeological and cultural sites
The road does not pass through or affect any known archaeological or cultural sites. Any
major rehabilitation work would necessitate consultation with the local communities to ensure
that possible sites are as little adversely affected as possible.
58602 Estima - Magoe                 January 2001                                3-8

1IIPACTO tltd                                                                   NIsEC
The project road traverses sandy, gravel, and red soils of medium to fine texture. The road
does not pass along steep hilly terrain therefore land slides and mass wasting issues are not of
concern.
Although the soils have a medium erosion potential, the erosion hazard along the project road
is considered to be low-medium and is a function of the gentle undulating topography
traversed. Erosion and sedimentation effects will be greater during the rain period, however
the impacts from construction will be minimised by limiting the area of ground disturbance at
any one site, and restricting works to the dry period.
ii   Sedimentation Risk
Sedimentation is a secondary process of erosion and can be exacerbated by road works due to:
o deliberate and unanticipated modifications to surface and ground water hydrology;
o incomplete rehabilitation of roadside verge areas; and
o road rehabilitation through naturally hilly terrain.
Ground disturbance and the temporary stockpiling of materials during road works can trigger
accelerated sedimentation processes. The onset of this process will be coincident with ground
disturbance and will continue up until sites have been stabilised. The extent of ground
disturbance and clearing along the road corridor will be small, with an average width of less
than 15m disturbed during construction.
Other areas where ground disturbance and clearing is required during construction include
stockpile areas, borrow pit sites, construction camps, and work compounds.
iii    Mitigation Measures
Specific measures for erosion and sediment control during construction include:
o design of drainage works to ensure these collect from and discharge to natural drainage
lines. This may not always be possible for mitre drains and in those situations frequent,
low volume drains are preferred;
o provision of energy dissipation devices where discharge velocities and flows will erode
downstream drainage lines;
o  minimisation of disturbed areas;
o design and construction of erosion and sedimentation controls such as diversion banks,
filter structures (filter fences or windrowed vegetation) and sediment traps;
o diversion of significant upstream flows around working areas;
o undertaking progressive rehabilitation and revegetation of all slopes and disturbed areas;
and
o installation of temporary erosion control drains prior to the wet season. No new road
excavation will be commenced during the wet season.
Vegetation will be established on slopes, such as batters and roadside embankments, to prevent
localised rill erosion. Stone pitching may be required near culverts and bridges where the
embankments of the road approaches are steeper.

The project provides an opportunity to undertake the planting of trees for soil conservation
purposes along the road corridor and within existing degraded areas, particularly gullies,
barren terrain, rivers and at borrow pit sites.
4.2.3    Water Quality
i    Construction
Sedimentation and resultant water quality effects were discussed in the previous section. This
section looks at other water quality issues.
Hydrocarbons sourced from improper disposal facilities for used lubricants and poor operation
and maintenance practices for construction vehicles and machinery can contaminate surface
waters. Improper disposal of oil filters and other materials from vehicle and machinery
maintenance can also cause pollution.
Spilled petroleum fuel, as well as bitumen and explosives residue, also have a potential to
contribute to the pollution of waterbodies, but to a very minor extent.
Improper sanitation and waste disposal procedures in temporary construction camps can also
contaminate water resources.
ii    Operation
Vehicle movements and the roadside maintenance of vehicles can result in the contamination
of water resources along a road corridor by fuel and lubricants. Accidents may result in the
spillage of fuels or other products.
These potential effects already exist. Improved road conditions will improve vehicle operating
conditions. Road accidents involving accidental spills of fuel, lubricants, chemicals or other
toxic materials, which could reach waterbodies, are likely to be reduced. The effect of the road
works is therefore likely to reduce water pollution potential from these factors.
iii    Mitigation Measures
All fuels, lubricants and bitumen will be stored in bunded areas. Vehicle maintenance and
refuelling will be confined to areas in construction camps designed to confine lubricants and
fuel spillages.
The Contractor shall ensure that all bitumen and fuel storage areas are bunded to contain at
least 120% of the maximum capacity of the largest storage tank. The floor of the bunded area
shall be impervious, and storage facilities and bunds shall be inspected weekly for spills.
Adequate waste disposal and sanitation facilities will be provided at construction camps.
Any waste water or stormwater discharged from the site shall comply with the following
objectives:

4.2.4    Hydrology
i   Construction
The main construction activity that has the potential to impede flows will be the stockpiling of
materials if placed near drainage lines.
ii   Operation
Although the road is an existing feature, it can cause an impedance to flow, alter the natural
channel position and result in increased velocities as a result of this change. The road crosses
numerous seasonal watercourses. Adequate provision of culverts along the road will improve
cross-road drainage.
Adequate and stable cross-road and road surface drainage is essential to ensure that storm
runoff across the road causes minimal damage to the road and minimises the effect of
inundation caused by impeded flows. Cross-road drainage shall be provided by causeways and
culverts to pass catchment flows past the road, either over or beneath it. Road surface drainage
shall be provided by side drains to direct run-off off the road surface.
The potential exists for unpredictable rises in the water level of lake Cahora Bassa. This may
result in flooding along sections of the road, and ponding where the road passes over or
through seasonal watercourses. The flat terrain of the littoral zone on the southern lakeshore
precludes the occurrence of significant scouring and sedimentation impacts.
iii   Mitigation Measures
All road rehabilitation should take place during the dry season to decrease the probability of
inducing impacts associated with flowing water and surface water bodies.
Particular attention shall be given to stockpiling materials away from existing drainage lines
and avoid filling in wetland areas.
All designed drainage works shall be installed at the time of initial road construction to ensure
that flows along drainage lines are not impeded.
Culverts shall be laid in a direction, which is as close to the natural position of the drainage
flow. This will avoid altering the channel flow and prevent upstream and downstream
scouring of the watercourse.
58602 Estima - Mago6                 January 2001                                4-5

Routine monitoring of road condition should be more intensive in the wet season when
watercourses are in flow . Dialogue between ANE and HCB (Hidroelectricidade de Cahora
Bassa) should be established regarding any anticipated rise in lake levels that may flood the
road. This will allow for the immediate implementation of post flood monitoring and an
assessment of flood impacts on the road.
4.2.5    Noise and Vibration
i   Construction
Additional noise will be generated along the project road corridors and at ancillary sites during
the construction period, particularly from increased numbers of heavy vehicles.
Peak noise levels generated by construction activities are expected to be greater than the peak
noise levels from road operation. Construction noise is generally intermittent and depends on
the type of operation, location and function of the equipment and the equipment use cycle. It
attenuates quickly over distance. For example excavation noise levels, assuming bulldozer and
dump truck activity, are approximately 85dBA at 15m. This decreases by about 3-4dBA with
each doubling of distance and would be reduced to approximately 7OdBA at about 240m.
ii   Operation
As accessibility is improved after completion of the road works, vehicle noise levels may
increase slightly with an expected increase in traffic volumes. After completion of the works,
the traffic on the project road is expected to experience a high growth rate due to improved
accessibility (See Part B). Overall traffic volumes will be low probably numbering a few
hundred vehicles a day.
Noise sources and factors which may contribute to the increase in the ambient noise level and
related adverse impacts during the operation of the improved roads will include vehicle noise,
vehicle maintenance and driver behaviour (such as the use of horns).
The improved road design will allow an increase in vehicle speed and some increase in the
overall noise level is likely to result. When traffic speed doubles, this results in a 6 dB(A)
increase in noise level (Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997). However, the project corridors are not
densely populated, and few sensitive sites, such as schools and hospitals, are expected to be
located close to the road. The majority of the road traverse cultivation land and woodland
areas. There is no potential for significant adverse noise effects.
The road works may reduce existing noise levels in built-up areas. The improvement of roads
will result in an improved road surface, which will consequently reduce noise levels through
the efficient operation of vehicles.

iii   Mitigation Measures
No national noise level standards currently exist for highway construction equipment in
Mozambique, however the World Bank recommends the use of construction equipment, which
meets international standards.
The following measures shall be implemented to minimise the impact of noise during the
construction phase:
o  work compounds shall be located at least 0.5km from settlements;
o construction activities within 150m of residential areas shall cease between 19:00 and
06:00 hours; and
o machinery and vehicles shall be maintained and repaired regularly.
4.2.6    Air Quality
i   Construction
The deterioration in air quality from dust generation and vehicle emissions during road
construction will be a relatively minor environmental impact. Significant adverse effects are
not expected because of the limited duration of construction at any one site and the few
receptors. Most of the work will occur in cultivated or woodland areas.
A deterioration in air quality during road construction will primarily occur from dust generated
by road excavation, spoil transportation and disposal. In addition, most construction activities
will progressively move along the alignment, so prolonged deterioration in air quality will not
occur at any one site. The minor volumes of dust generated will cause short-term localised
problems through settlements.
Road construction workers will be exposed to minor dust emissions over the construction
period, with the quantity of dust partly dependent upon wind conditions.
ii    Operation
Exhaust emissions from traffic utilising the rehabilitated road are likely to increase due to the
high percentage increase in traffic growth expected (See Part B). Total emissions will be low
because the increase will be from a low existing traffic volume.
The level of dust is expected to reduce with rehabilitation as a result of stabilising the road
surface.
Improved road geometry will also reduce exhaust emissions along the project roads by
reducing the roughness of the road surface (particularly by removal of potholes), increasing the
design speed and thereby reducing the need for excessive acceleration and deceleration.

iii   Mitigation Measures
Mitigation measures will be implemented in areas where significant air quality problems
would arise due to construction activities and during road operation in major settlements and
near sensitive sites such as schools and hospitals.
Minimising air emissions is particularly important during the construction stage, for activities
such as the operation of borrow pits and in-situ mixing of cement and sand, which have a
potential to generate high dust levels.
During the construction period, the following mitigation measures to suppress dust will be
implemented:
o Water will be sprayed during the construction period at earth mixing sites, asphalt-mixing
sites, and on cleared surfaces. Water spraying will be undertaken during periods of high
wind, or when necessary, to suppress dust.
o Operations shall be suspended during periods of dry windy weather, in areas where wind
blown dust is causing a nuisance in settlements or towns.
a All equipment and plant machinery shall not emit visible smoke for a continuous period of
greater than 10 seconds.
O All exhaust systems and engines on plant and equipment shall be in accordance with the
manufacturers specifications and kept well maintained to ensure that they have a high level
operating efficiency.
4.3 BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
4.3.1    Identification
i   Direct impacts
Vegetation will need to be cleared to undertake the road rehabilitation works and enable road
formation widening and construction of additional drainage. The conservation value of the
road corridor vegetation that will be cleared is not high and woodland areas crossed by the
road are utilised for slash and burn agriculture. The impact of vegetation clearing for the
construction works will not be significant due to the already degraded nature of the woodland
habitat and low conservation value.
Vegetation may also be cleared in areas selected for ancillary sites, such as construction
camps, borrow pits and quarries, to enable the utilisation of these areas.
ii   Indirect impacts
There is a potential impact associated with the indirect loss and degradation of vegetation,
habitat and species in the ROI. These potential impacts are associated with:
o improved access;

Mozambique Road Sector EA             DRAFT



MIPA CTO La tiI'*SMEC
Li in-migration; and
o construction workforce behaviour.
Ecological degradation of the ROI may occur from vegetation harvesting and wildlife
poaching by the construction workforce, and increased harvesting during road operation due to
greater accessibility and additional local demands from road-induced activities.
The projects will provide improved access to the neighbouring areas and facilitate natural
resource use. The main potential for increased natural resource harvesting is likely to occur
within the area's woodlands.
The population increase along the road corridor would be derived either from people migrating
to the roadside from the immediate area (i.e. the 5km region of influence and adjacent to this),
or from other areas. This in-migration has a potential to create an increased local demand for
fuelwood and construction timber, as well as other woodland products to support secondary
enterprise activities, such as forage collection for grazing animals. Hunting may also increase.
The proposed road improvements will follow an existing alignment and almost all woodland
areas neighbouring this road are currently accessible. The road will only increase potential
access to these areas, not open them up.
Importing a construction workforce into an area may increase demand on local natural
resources due to competition for firewood, woodland products and wildlife. These increased
demands will be focussed on the areas surrounding workforce camps and work compounds.
Worker camps may also encourage the temporary construction of markets and barracas to
service the workers. These temporary facilities may also increase demand on local natural
resources.
West of the Daque River, the road traverses Tchumo Tchato controlled land where large
mammal populations are increasing as a consequence of active conservation management.
One consequence of increased traffic volume will be an increase in accident risk from large
mammals crossing the road both during the day and at night.
4.3.2    Mitigation measures
i   Direct Impacts
Vegetation clearance along the road edge and at ancillary sites (such as borrow pits) will be
minimised. All construction areas will be clearly marked and construction activity prohibited
outside the defined areas. Trees within ancillary sites shall be retained wherever possible.
Retention of trees within areas such as worker camps will improve the camp amenity and
provide shade.
All temporarily disturbed areas will be rehabilitated following construction. The establishment
of ground cover is the initial priority of revegetation. Ground cover reduces raindrop impact,
binds the soil surface and creates a micro-climate favourable for the establishment of other
vegetation. Species should be selected for cover crops and permanent revegetation. A cover
crop consisting of a rapid growing species and several vigorous grass species should be used to

Mozambique Road Sector EA              DRAFT



IIPA CTO L d(1(1                                                             SMEC
rapidly establish ground cover on disturbed areas. Permanent revegetation species should be
selected to be consistent with species native to an area.
Revegetation will aim to stabilise the disturbed areas and assist the desirable secondary uses of
natural resources including:
o  production of forage, wood, flowers, fruit, medicinal items;
o shade and shelter;
o fencing and screens; and
o building supports.
Revegetation along different sections of road will be designed to achieve site-specific aims,
such as maximising shade within villages and providing a species composition that is
compatible with sLirrounding vegetation cover.
ii   Indirect Impacts
The most potential for indirect effects was identified to be associated with workforce camps.
This is a temporary effect but may last several years depending on the duration of the works
project. To reduce the potential for increased exploitation of natural resources the following
migration measures will be implemented. The Contractor will:
o provide and maintain adequate drinking and bathing water supplies;
o provide kerosene or other fuel source and stoves for worker use;
o educate workers about the responsible use of natural resources; and
o ensure workers act in a responsible manner and apply penalties for the harvesting of local
resources (wood, wildlife or wood products).
Management measures will ensure that construction workers are educated about illegal
poaching and forest clearing and strict penalties will be enforced. Signage will be required
warning motorists of the presence of large mammals (notably elephant and antelopes)
especially to the west of the Daque River. Local communities involved in conservation-based
initiatives must be consulted and informed of road rehabilitation activities taking place within
conservation areas. The workforce must be informed concerning the dangers associated with
working in wildlife areas.
4.4 SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
4.4.1    Direct Impacts
i   Loss of agricultural land, buildings, sites of cultural value, population displacement,
and natural resources degradation
It is unlikely that any improvements to the road will require significant areas of cultivated land.
The main loss will occur at borrow pits and minor realigning of the road. It is likely that small
areas of land currently used for cultivation will be lost. Where an area of cultivated land has to
58602 Estima - Magoe                 January 2001                               4-10
Mozambique Road Sector EA              DRAFT



IJVIPA CTO L da                                                              ':SEC
be resumed for road construction, the farmer will be compensated for loss of production. The
following process will be applied:
o where possible the farmer should be notified of the loss of land one season in advance.
This is to avoid unnecessary loss of effort and seed; and
o the value of the lost production should be determined in consultation with the District
Agricultural Officer and the local Chefe de Poste. Compensation will be paid to the farmer
for the value of the lost production.
Borrow pits, storage and equipment areas, and construction camps will be located on marginal
or disturbed land. The acquiring of land for such purposes must be subject to ANE and
Provincial approval.  In selecting land consultation must also be undertaken with local
communities and their traditional leaders as well as local authorities (at District and Ward
level).
No displacement of population is likely. Cultivation is not continuous along the road and there
is sufficient land for machambas if necessary to be realigned. It is not envisaged that there
would any displacement of population of the local population due to road improvement.
4.4.2   Indirect Impacts
i   Access to services
Improvement of the road is likely to have significant socio-economic impacts. Availability of
services to the populations of Districts is poor. An improved road would enable, for example,
sick patients to gain access to better health services. Improved road communication would
also improve access for children to higher education facilities.
ii   Improved access to markets
Poor communication has been cited as a major problem which, perhaps most importantly,
limits the ability of the local population to transport surplus agricultural production to market.
Similarly improvements to the road would enable goods and services to flow more easily into
the area particularly those associated with improving agricultural production techniques and
yields.
MAgoe town is likely to benefit significantly from road improvement. The town is remote and
the road is its principle access to other parts of Mozambique. Improvements to the road would
reduce this travelling time and expense for people accessing the main road to Tete and other
parts of the Province.
An improved access road may also facilitate access to the Tchuma Tchato project and assist in
the development of ecotourism.

iii   In-migration of people and concessions
The road adjoins areas identified to have a high potential for forestry. Road improvements will
enable improved access for people wanting to exploit the natural resources of the District.
Mitigation measures are necessary if these natural resources are not over exploited.
Improvement of roads in other rural areas within Mozambique leads often to increases in in-
migration as advantage is taken of the improved communication. It is probable that some in-
migration will take place particularly in areas in close proximity to the road. Regullos have an
influence in terms of the local allocation of land. Mitigating measures should involve working
with regulos and other local authorities to control any possible in-migration.
Under existing Mozambican legislation all land belongs to the State. However, private sector
farmers may acquire long-term rights over land by obtaining a Title of Use and Exploitation.
Individuals may also seek concession rights over tracts of land to harvest timber.
Requests for "concessions" are lodged with an area's Provincial Agricultural Services. Once
access to hitherto isolated areas is improved following rehabilitation of a road it could be
expected that concession seekers will attempt to access these lands.
Although, at present, all land in Mozambique belongs to the State the defacto situation is that
land is being managed and allocated according to traditional customary land rights. The
potential for conflict over land between local communities and "concession seekers" is high.
Very few traditional farmers have formalized their rights to the land under existing legislation.
Where it is expected that demand for concessions increase as a result of improved access the
existing traditional land "ownership" should be mapped within the roads region of influence.
This should be undertaken at the road design phase to reduce the later potential for conflict
between traditional landowners and concession seekers.
iv    Health issues
The improvement of the road will necessitate the inflow of a number of construction workers
from other parts of Mozambique. The inflow of road gangs particularly into remote areas has a
potential for adverse effects. The most often cited problem is the one of HIV-AIDs and
sexually transmitted diseases.  Mitigation measures against these likely impacts require
working closely with respective govemment departments, local NGOs and/or church based
organisations, local communities, and road gangs.  Educational programs for the local
populations are considered to be extremely important in trying to reduce the likelihood of HIV-
AIDs infection.
v    Construction worker camps
The health issues related to construction worker camps particularly in terms of the spread of
HIV-AIDs and other sexually transmitted disease have been mentioned above.   A
concentration of workers also attracts other inward migrants who attempt to exploit new
market opportunities. Such informal sites are often poorly managed in terms of adherence to
health regulations and waste disposal. Mitigation measures should include the identification of
suitable sites for the establishment of small shops and other facilities servicing road-gangs.

In conclusion road improvements to the road will have significant positive impacts. Improved
communication would improve the ability of local populations to transport surplus agricultural
production to market. It would also likely to stimulate more production if farmers knew they
had a means of transporting their goods. Magoe town and the Tchuma Tchato project would
be beneficiaries of road improvements. The main negative socio-economic impacts relate top
the problem of the spread of HIV-AIDs infection. Campaigns in other parts of Mozambique
have demonstrated that these problems can mitigate against particularly if resources and
education are directed at the local population and not just the influx of construction workers.

5 UPGRADING AND MAINTENANCE MITIGATION
MEASURES
Design, construction and maintenance mitigation recommendations for the proposed roads
were formulated to avoid or mitigate potential biophysical impacts.
The road works will include environmental impact mitigation measures within the Contract
Specifications. These measures will be incorporated as specific instructions to the Contractor
and will be provided in a separate Environmental Management Guideline (EMG) identifying
specific instructions for the Contractor including responsibilities, outputs, costs and timing of
mitigation measures.
The EMG describes the practical means to ensure effective implementation of the mitigation
measures recommended for the potential adverse environmental impacts identified in the EIA.
The EMG will include but will not be limited to the following elements:
oi practical means to implement the recommended mitigation measures;
o implementation schedule and supervision program; and
o monitoring and evaluation.
In addition, the program also specifies what action will be taken and by whom in the event that
the proposed mitigation measures fail, either partially or totally, to achieve the level of
environmental protection expected.
An outline of the EMG for the construction and operation stage is provided in the main volume
of this report.
Specific socio-economic impact mitigation measures will include further consultation with
potentially affected land holders and provision of compensatory measures in accordance with
the current Government of Mozambique policy. These measures have been formulated by the
Department of Agriculture and include guidelines for the displacement of people and
acquisition of land for the roads.

1 INTRODUCTION
This Annex contains an environmental assessment for one of four additional roads to be
included as part of the Phase I World Bank projects (giving a total of 15 project roads).
Due to time limitations, no field investigations were undertaken for the this environmental
assessment. The description of the environment, potential impacts and recommendations were
prepared as a baseline study using information from existing literature sources, available
mapping sources, knowledge of Provincial characteristics and personal field observations from
ANE technical staff.

2 BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS
2.1  TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS
The road is located in a plateau zone generally at altitudes between 400 and l,000m. The area
traversed is a mixture of undulating terrain with steeper areas at either end of the road. There
are some elevations at 1,000 to 1,500 m above sea level to the north of Fingoe where the
landscape becomes more rugged and mountainous.
2.2 CLIMATE
Lying in the inter-tropical zone, the area has a tropical and subtropical climate with two
seasons, wet and hot (November to March), and dry and cool (April to October). The average
annual rainfall is 642mm, concentrated mainly in the wet season. Drought conditions are a
frequent occurrence during the dry season.
The average annual temperature is 270 C, the coldest months June and July, and the hottest
months October and November (see Figure 1).

The probability of extreme events (cyclones, floods) is minimal. Over the past five years there
have been no such events.
2.3 GEOLOGY
The geological formations traversed by the road are of Karroo origin and derive from the
oldest geological period, the Pre-Cambrian. Granite outcrops belonging to the Gabbro-
Anorthositic Complex are a feature of the geology of the region.
Pre-Cambrian formations occur extensively in the Tete Province especially north of the
Zambezi River where outcrops are generally found in the large plateau at elevations between
800 to 1,500m. These are best shown in the in northern Tete Province.
The Karroo geological formation covers a sizeable area to the north of the Zambeze River. In
general the outcrop corresponds to the large tectonic depressions in the Pre-Cambrian
formation and occurs at an average height of 200 to 600m.
Regionally the main type of rock in the area belongs to the Gabbro-Anorthositic Complex that
extends as far as Estima in the west, crossing the Zambezi to the north of Tete to the Revubue
river in the east.
The predominant rocks in the Gabbro-Anorthositic Complex in Tete are gabbros and norites.
The other lithotypes are: diorites, Anorthosites, rock with ferrous oxide, titanium and
vanadium, pyroxenite, basic dikes, and granulites with pyroxene.

The soil erosion potential along the road is generally medium to high. The high classification
is associated with the more rugged terrain around either end of the road and rainfall intensity.
2.5 LAND USE
Dispersed small settlements and homesteads are found along the road while larger settlements
are found in Fingoe and Bene. Herbaceous formations interspersed with small cultivated fields
make up the greater portion of the vegetation of the area. Thickets of shrubs averaging
between 0.5 and 3m but with heights to 7m are also found along the road alignment.
2.6 RIVERS AND WATER QUALITY
The road crosses the Capoche River approximately 20km west of Bene and the Nhimbe River
(a minor tributary of the Capoche) approximately 20km east of Fingoe. The area falls within
the hydrographic basin of the Capoche River, which is a sub-basin of the Zambezi River. Most
of the rivers in the area flow from north-west to south-east.
2.7 VEGETATION COVER AND USE
The area has open woodland vegetation, with grasses and some small deciduous trees that lose
their leaves in the dry season, giving the area a semi-arid character. The composition of the
vegetation is predominantly Miombo woodland common to a vast geographic area and does
not include species of biological value or with special conservation status. To the west of Bene
there is an initial area of Mopane woodland extending approximately 10 km to the east and
west of the Capoche River.
Adjacent to the road are extensive tracts of relatively undisturbed vegetation. Disturbance for
small farms or cultivated areas is concentrated along the road corridor, particularly in the lower
undulating areas.
The following vegetation types occur along the road:
i   Tardily Deciduous Miombo Woodland (Northern Plateau)
Brachystegiafloribunda, B. longifolia and often Julbernadia globiflora (Mapping Unit 18,
Wild and Barbosa 1967)
In Tete Province this corresponds approximately to a woodland where Brachystegia boehmii,
Prinari curatellifolia, and combretum molle occurs interspersed with tree or shrub savannas of
parinari, Uapaca, Faurea, etc. or shrub savannas of protea, Vitex, securidaca and several
species of Dombeya, i.e. D. nyaasica, D. johnstonii, D.lasiostylis and D. rotundifolia. These
communities appear at altitudes between 700 and 1,500m in red leached ferralitic soils.
Brachystegia manga is very common at altidues between 700 and 1,OOOm associated with B.
boehmii, J. globiflora, Pericopsis angolensis, Pterocarpus angolensis, Burkea africana,
Swartzia madagascariensis, Diplorhynchus condylocarpon, and Combretum spp. At lower
altitudes, Brachystegia bussei becomes common.
The grass flora includes Hyparrhenia spp. Andropong sp. and Chloridion cameronii.

ii   Deciduous Miombo Savanna Woodland (North-Eastern Lowland & Escarpment)
Brachystegia boehmii, B. allenni, Julbernardia globiflora (Mapping Unit 29, Wild & Barbosa
1967)
In Tete Province Brachystegia boehmii is dominant and abundant. The trees are 8 to Im tall in
orange, ferralitic more or less shallow sloping soils. The principal species are B. manga,
Julbernadia globiflora, Brachystegia utilis (relatively rare), Pericopsis angolensis,
Pterocarpus angolensis, Burkea africana, and Swartzia madagascariensis.
Another typical community of this type includes Brachystegia boehmii, Julbernadia
globiflora, Burkea africana, Pterocarpus angolensis, P. tinctorius, Hymenocardia acida,
Terminalia sericea, and Acacia macrothyrsa.
The grass layer is predominantly Hyparrhenia and Themeda triandra.
iii   Dry Deciduous Miombo
(Julbernardia globiflora) (Mapping Unit 30, Wild & Barbosa 1967).
A Julbernardia globiflora type occurs in Tete Province and is widespread in belts between the
Brachystegia boehmii communities and the drier Colophospermum mopane savanna
woodlands. It is also abundant on the Zambezi valley slopes from 400-700 m. and in the
lowlands where the topography is irregular. The following species in a decreasing order of
frequency occur where Julbernardia globiflora is dominant: Diplorhynchus condylocarpus,
Terminalia sericea, Brachystegia boehmii, Diospyros kirkii, Oxytenanthera abyssica,
Colophospermum mopane, Pterocarpus brenanii, Combretum ghasalense, Burkea africana,
Piliostigma thonningii, Pseudolachnostylis maprouneifolia, Acacia nigrescensis, Kirkia
acuminata, Dalbergia melanoxylon, etc. (Barbosa, 1958).
iv    Mopane Woodland
(Mapping Unit 35, Wild & Barbosa 1967).
Mopane woodland, after miombo woodland, is the second most important woodland type in
Mozambique. Mopane covers large areas in the Zambezi Valley (Tete Province) and the
valleys of its tributaries from Lupata to Zumbo below 400 m. The annual rainfall is 500-700
mm.
In the Zambezi valley the Colophospermum mopane woodland is usually medium or tall (10-
15 m.), almost pure but with some Adansonia digitata. The soils are brownish, clayey,
compact, with some calcareous material, relatively deep and mainly derived from Karroo
formations. In pans and depressions with calcareous soils, grassland with Setaria sp. is
dominant.
In shallow, stony and also calcareous soils Acacia nigrescens (subdominant), Dalbergia
melanoxylon, Acacia nilotica, Combretum ghasalense, Dalbergia boehmii, Adansonia digitata,
Albizia harveyi, Terminalia prunioides, T. stuhlmannii, Ziziphus mucronata, Combretum
apiculatum, Afzelia quanzensis, etc. accompany the still dominant mopane. Associated shrubs
or perennial include Euphorbiaceae (Euphorbia spp., Erythrococca sp.); Capparidaceae

(Capparis, Thylacium, Cadaba, Maerua); Acanthaceae (Barleria, Disperma); Apocynaceae
(Adenium); Liliaceae (Aloe, Sansivieria) and Salvadoraceae (Salvadora, Azima). The grass
layer is of tufted species such as Ischaemum glaucostachyum, Eragrostis spp., Aristida spp.,
Setaria sp., etc.
Mopane savanna woodland often grades into Julbernardia globiflora savanna woodland in drier
areas with poorer well-drained soils and into the Adansonia, Sterculia savanna domain.
On the banks of the Zambezi River the mopane is often replaced by Ziziphus mauritiana,
Diospyros mespiliformis and sometimes Berchemia discolor.
In small depressions there are savannas with shrubby Combretum ghasalense (generally
dominant) and Diospyros kirkii, Terminalia sericea, Acacia nilotica, A. spp., Lonchocarpus
capassa, Ziziphus mucronata, etc.
The distribution of these vegetation types is depicted in Figure 4.

2.8 WILDLIFE AND CONSERVATION AREAS
Faunal assemblages are relatively depauperate in the area. Mammals are scarce with
herbivores such as Impala only occasionally sighted. A list of reported species is presented in
Table 2.

There are no conservation areas in the immediate vicinity of the road.
2.9 NOISE AND AIR QUALITY
Noise levels along the Bene to Fingoe Project Road, are very low due to the absence of traffic
noise and sparse settlement along the route. Noise would be predominantly generated by
natural conditions (wind, insects, frogs, birds etc.).
Ambient air quality in all of the proposed road areas is good due to a lack of industry and
urban activity. Haze may be observed due to the frequently practiced slash and bum
agriculture and production of charcoal. Levels of airborne dust generated by wind passing
over agricultural field and smoke from forest and grassland fires can also be high.

3 SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
3.1 PROVINCIAL CHARACTERISTICS
The purpose of this section is to describe the socio-economic environment in Tete Province.
Information was derived from existing reports and publications where information is
disaggregated usually at the Provincial and District levels.
To describe the living conditions for the populations living along or in proximity to the road a
variety of Provincial and District socio-economic indices was used. Where possible statistical
information was provided to enable the establishment of base line data from which the impacts
of road improvement may be made.
3.1.1    Context and Administration
i   Provincial setting and administration
Tete Province is located in the north westem region of Mozambique and borders three
countries, Malawi to the east, Zambia in the north and Zimbabwe to the west. To the south of
Tete Province lies the Province of Manica. The shape of Tete Province as a peninsula
surrounded by foreign countries has influenced the economic, cultural and social links of Tete
with surrounding countries. The province also acts as a main corridor between the surrounding
countries.
Administratively Tete is divided into 12 Districts, with a Provincial Capital also called Tete.
Tete is the third largest Province in Mozambique with a land surface of 100,724km2
representing 12.8% of the land surface of Mozambique. Conversely it has the second lowest
population density at 11 people per km2.
ii   Traditional administration
Traditional administration authority exists in Tete Province. The importance attached to the
regulos varies from area to area. In those localities where the regulos are strong and respected
they will intervene in a variety of aspects of every-day life. Such issues would include
resolving social conflicts; allocating land for building housing, managing water sources and
supporting official health program such HIV/AIDS management.
Like most parts of Mozambique, tensions exist between the two types of administrative
systems. These tensions were exaggerated during the armed conflict. Areas controlled by
RENAMO largely reverted back to traditional leadership structures, while those under
Govemment control retained their post-independence organisational structures.

IMIPACTO Lda                                                          4iNSMEC
3.1.2    Population Characteristics
i Population
The 1997 national survey estimated the population of Tete to be 1,144,604 inhabitants with
more women (595,674) than men (548,930). The country's annual population growth rate is
estimated at 2.2% and if that rate continues to 2009 it is calculated that the population will
have grown by 34% to about 1,533,769.
The population of Tete Province is young with more than 50% aged 14 or younger. The
population density for Tete Province (11 inhabitants per kmi2) is lower than for the average
population density for the country (19 inhabitants per kM2). The total urban population is
calculated at 15% of the Provincial population In comparison to other Provinces Tete has a
relatively low urban percentage.
The population of Tete Province has experienced significant mobility over the last 40 years.
This has been associated with both the wars in Mozambique and also the Zimbabwe liberation
war. While most of Mozambique has experienced similar problems the people of Tete
probably experienced greater dislocation.
ii   Ethnicity
There are three main ethnic groups in Tete Province, the Nyanja (48%), Nyungwe (28%) and
Sena (12%). These percentages were based on the mother tongue of the people. Less than 3%
of the population speak Portuguese as their mother tongue.
iii   Gender
Despite the advancement of the rights of women under independent Mozambican
administration, girls and women in Tete Province do less well than boys and men. Access to
health services directed specifically at women is generally very poor. Literacy rates for
women are lower than for men. Family law in Mozambique still discriminates against women.
A married woman has limited rights to make independent economic decisions or enjoy full
ownership of assets, and a widow's rights to inheritance are secondary to males in the family.
Girls in rural areas in general marry young often as soon as they reach puberty.
3.1.3    Economic Characteristics
i   Economy
The economy of Tete is predominantly agricultural. Based on the percentage of people in
occupations the most important activities at the 1997 census were agriculture (90%/O), service
industries (5.5%), manufacturing (1.5%) and construction (1.4%).
58602 Bene - Fingoe               January 2001                             3-2

IMUPA CTO L da                                                           "VSMEC
There is a low urban-rural ratio, with a majority of people (90%) dependant on subsistence
agriculture for their livelihood. There are few formal sector employment opportunities except
in the city of Tete.
ii   Poverty
Tete is one of the poorest provinces in the country with 82% classed as poor and 54% as very
poor. This compares with national averages of 69% (poor) and 38% (very poor).
Life expectancy in Tete Province is expected to be below the average level of 42 years
registered for the country.
3.1.4    Services
i   Education and health facilities
Information about the specific education and health facilities in Tete Province were not
compiled. Based on other roads studied for this project it is expected that:
o  There will be few schools and the availability of education will decrease as a child ages.
The average ratio of pupils:teacher is expected to be in excess of 50:1.
cl Common illnesses in the Province are malaria, tuberculosis, bilharzia, intestinal parasites,
acute respiratory infection, AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases and non-specific diarrhoea.
o  Current rates of HIV infection are in excess of 23% and are projected to rise. The central
region containing the provinces of Tete, Manica, Sofala and Zambezia has the highest rate
of infection in the country due to the presence of major transport corridors and proximity
to borders.
o  Probably half of all children under five-will suffer from chronic malnutrition and 1 in 10
from acute malnutrition.
ii   Access to services
Access to services for the rural population is generally poor. Most villages will have a primary
school but these schools could be categorised as rudimentary and often the availability of
teachers is very low. Figures are not available for the provision of secondary schools. Most
villages will have access to a basic health centre but few have access to a doctor. Dependence
on traditional healers is the norm for the vast majority of the population and almost every
village would have at least one person categorised as a traditional healer.
3.1.5    Livelihood Strategies
The principle economic activity in Tete Province is agriculture and 90% of the population
listed agriculture, forestry or fishing as their main area of activity at the 1997 census. Forestry
and fishing activities are generally for personal consumption. Most food production is within
the family sector upon which the majority of the population is dependent. The principle food
crops grown are maize, sorghum and millet.

Livestock production is important to the well being of people in Tete. Most families will have
goats and a lesser number cattle. These animals are kept for reproduction and used as an
income source (money or barter).
3.1.6    Archaeological and Cultural Sites
The road does not pass through or affect any known archaeological or cultural sites. Any
major rehabilitation work would necessitate consultation with local administrative or
traditional leaders to identify any local cultural sites.
3.2 DISTRICT CHARACTERISTICS
3.2.1    Context and Administration
i   Introduction
This section describes socio-economic factors more specific to the EN221 Bene-Fingoe road.
The main sources of information relate to existing written reports concerning the Districts the
EN221 passes through. To better assess the possible and probable impacts of improvements to
the EN221 more detailed studies for socio-economic purposes will be needed.
ii   District setting and administration
Th  Xene to Fingoe EN221 road passes through the Districts of Chifunde and Maravia located
in t . central-north of Tete Province. To the north, Chifunde and Maravia District border with
Zambia. In the District headquarters representatives of the main sector ministries such as the
Health Ministry are found.
The EN221 project road begins on the outskirts of Bene, within the District of Chifunde and
continues into Maravia District where it ends at Fingoe.
iii   Political Environment
No inforrnation is available for voting practices based in the two Districts. Tete Province
voted for both the ruling FRELIMO party and RENAMO during the general elections of late
1999.
3.2.2    Population Characteristics
i   Population
The 1997 national census estimated the population of Chifunde District as 48,498 inhabitants
with a density of population of 5 inhabitants per km2. The sex ration is close to parity with
23,719 males and 24,779 females. The District has three administrative posts at Chifunde,

Mualadzi and N'Sadzo. The administrative post of Mualadzi is the most populous with
approximately 31,550 inhabitants.
The 1997 national census estimated that the population of Maravia District was 53,031
inhabitants, totaling 12,405 families, with a population density of 3 inhabitants per km2. These
are distributed in the four administrative posts of Maravia District, namely the posts at
Chibuto, Fingoe, Molowera and Chipera.
ii    Ethnicity
Most people living along the road are from the Nyanja ethnic group.
3.2.3     Economic Characteristics
i    Economy
The economy of the Maravia and Chifunde Districts is almost entirely based on agriculture.
ii    Poverty
The nutritional situation in the District is reasonable although the first semester of the year is
one where high hunger incidence is recorded. .Acute malnutrition , anaemia, hyperthyroid
disease and a lack of micro-nutrients are the major problems experienced in the district.
Although many cases are dealt with locally, the more serious cases are transferred to the Tete
Provincial Hospital.
Categorizing families in terms of poor, medium and rich indicates some differentiation
between the two Districts. Surveys indicate that on average within Chifunde District, between
75% to 80% of families are poor, 10% to 15 % medium and 5% to 10% rich. In Maravia
District approximately 85% of families are poor, 10 % medium and 5% rich Table 4 gives
examples of the characteristics of poverty for an average household.

3.2.4    Services
i   Education
According to information available from the District Development Profiles, of the 23 primary
schools in Chifunde District in 1982, only four schools with a total of 39 classrooms were
operating at the time of publishing the reports. No secondary schools exist in the District. The
schools cater from the I st to 4th/5th grade and each teacher has an average of 53 pupils in each
class. Of the 47 teachers in the District, 22 have no training, 16 have 6th grade and an
additional three years of training and nine have 6th grade and one year of training.
Maravia district has six lower primary schools. These are located in Fingoe town, Malowera,
Uncanha, Chiputo, Chipera and Nhenda. Forty-six teachers provide education from 1st to 5th
grades. The schools total 42 classrooms of which 18 are in the school at Fingoe. In the other
schools, the numbers of classrooms range from two to eight. No secondary school or upper
primary exists in Maravia district. Consequently, students must travel long distances to attend
upper primary schools.
ii   Health
Although no district hospital exists in Chifunde District there are three health posts, two of
which have a total of ten beds. The third post has still to be rehabilitated. Additionally, a
maternity unit with six beds was built in Nsadzo locality. A health unit is a category of health
provision below a health post. Within the District there are four basic medical assistants, three
elementary level assistants, four orderlies an 11 traditional midwives.
The District of Maravia possesses a rehabilitated health centre with six beds in the
administrative post of Maravia, one health post in Malowera with a vaccination post but no
maternity unit, and one at Chipera, with four beds, a maternity unit and a vaccination post.
The district posses a number of medical staff, namely seven basic medical assistants, seven
elementary medical assistants, one community health worker, 23 traditional midwives and
three orderlies.
3.2.5    Livelihood
i   Livelihood strategies
Subsistence agriculture is the main activity of families living in the Districts. The main food
crops grown are maize sorghum, beans and millet. Some sweet potato and groundnuts are also
grown.
Table 5 shows total cultivated area by Crop (hectres) and total production (tonnes/metric) for
1999/2000 for the Districts. While livestock production is not very significant, pigs, chickens,
cattle and goats are kept for household consumption, as well as for the market. The extent of
the agricultural activity is dependent upon several factors, notably the:

ii   General characteristics of a family living along or in close proximity to the Fingoe
to Bene EN221 road
Agricultural activities are carried out by the different members of the family who partake in
sowing, weeding and harvesting. Women are responsible for gathering fuel wood by chopping
down trees alongside men. Men also deal with crop storage. The agricultural produce grown
by the family is mainly used for own consumption but excess is sold in the markets of the
district capital or to traders who come from the provincial capital. It is common to find
families who use the same farmland every year and who do not leave the land fallow. The
main agricultural system is still based upon slash and bum techniques.
In the house women will look after the children, cook, clean the house, and would be involved
in most daily household activities. Men are responsible for construction and maintenance of
the house. The period of most work is between November and February, the main period of
cultivation and harvest. Women will control the household stocks of food while men will be
responsible for expenditure related to the children.
3.2.6    Archaeological and cultural sites
The road does not pass through or affect any known archaeological or cultural sites. However,
any major rehabilitation work would necessitate consultation with the local communities to
ensure that possible sites are as little adversely affected as possible.

4 POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
4.1 INTRODUCTION
This section provides an assessment of the potential environmental impacts that are likely to
occur as a result of the Bene to Fingoe road works. Identified impacts will be mitigated
through the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures, which are discussed in detail
in Part D of this report. Environmental factors considered were:
o  land use change;
o  erosion and sedimentation;
o  water quality;
o  hydrology;
O  noise and vibration;
o  air quality;
o  biological effects; and
o  socio-economic effects.
Each of these issues is addressed in Sections covering the physical, biological and socio-
economic environments.
The majority of direct environmental impacts will be minor due to the limited extent of works
at any one site and the incorporation of impact mitigation measures into the improvement
works.
Indirect biophysical impacts may result from increased natural resource use due to increased
local enterprise activity to service increased traffic. These impacts are also anticipated to be
relatively minor due to the fact that the road is already well established as the major access
route from the northem interior of the Province to the Provincial capital of Tete.
Many of the potential environmental impacts associated with the construction of a new road do
not occur to the same degree when a road is improved within the existing road corridor. The
most likely impacts include:
o altered land use patterns due to improved accessibility, such as a change from forestry to
agriculture, or from agriculture to industry (Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997);
o  public health problems, particularly through the spread of communicable disease (Birley,
1997); and
o  increased illegal logging and poaching activities due to improved access into forest areas
(Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997).

IMPACTO Lda                                                               VWSMEC
4.2 PHYSICAL EFFECTS
4.2.1    Land Use
i   Construction and Operation
The proposed road improvement works will not require a significant change to the land use
within the road corridor. Limited road improvement works will be undertaken and no road
realignments are anticipated. Resettlement will not be required.
A range of temporary ancillary activities (such as batching plant sites, borrow pits and
workforce camp sites) will be required during the construction works but will affect relatively
small land areas. These sites will be selected in consultation with local communities and
rehabilitated upon completion of activities.
There are no known existing borrow areas located nearby the project road but suitable
materials are available within the region to use as fill. The nearest active stone quarry is
located approximately 75km south of Bene along the main road to Tete.
The road works are not likely to have a significant effect on adjacent land use activities, as the
access currently exists.
ii   Mitigation Measures
Mitigation measures include:
o  measures identified under socio-economics for selection and negotiation of use;
L  preferably locating ancillary sites in areas currently cleared or degraded to avoid the need
for additional land clearing; and
o  rehabilitation of all sites to their original condition, or better, to allow resumption of prior
land use.
4.2.2    Erosion and Sedimentation
i   Erosion hazard
The dynamic interplay of several key factors dictates the degree of susceptibility to water-
driven soil erosion processes. These are:
o  seasonality and intensity of rainfall in relation to water run-off;
o  landscape topography and slope gradient;
o  soil profile parameters, notably depth and binding properties;
o  degree of vegetation cover; and
o  magnitude and frequency of seismic events.
58602 Bene - Fingoe                 January 2001                               4-2

IJlPA CTO L(la                                                               NiSIEC
The project road traverses red and brown clayey soils of medium texture.
The road traverses mostly gently undulating terrain but steeper gradients are encountered close
to Fingoe and Bene.
The erosion hazard along the project road is medium to high and is a function of the
topography landscape, soils and rainfall intensity. Erosion and sedimentation potential will be
greater during the wet season.
ii   Sedimentation Risk
Sedimentation is a secondary process of erosion and can be exacerbated by road works due to:
o deliberate and unanticipated modifications to surface and ground water hydrology;
o incomplete rehabilitation of roadside verge areas; and
o road rehabilitation through naturally hilly terrain.
Ground disturbance and the temporary stockpiling of materials during road works can trigger
accelerated sedimentation processes. The onset of this process will be coincident with ground
disturbance and will continue up until sites have been stabilised. The extent of ground
disturbance and clearing along the road corridor will be small, with an average width of less
than 1 5m disturbed during construction.
Other areas where ground disturbance and clearing is required during construction include
stockpile areas, borrow pit sites, construction camps, and work compounds.
There is the potential for erosion from the improvement works. No road designs are available
and it is not possible to say whether significant cut and fill is required or whether retaining
walls will be required. There may be a need for earthworks and specific stabilisation works.
These will need to be identified during the project design phase.
iii   Mitigation Measures
Specific stabilisation measures that may be incorporated into the project design include:
o  identification of geotechnically unstable areas.  Engineering designs would need to
consider road stability in these areas;
o  design of cut and fill batter slopes for long-term stability;
o  incorporation of retaining walls (dry rock and/or gabions) into the project;
o  hydrologic designs to specifically consider channel stability and identify the need for
linings such as rip-rap rock.
Specific measures for erosion and sediment control during construction include:
o  design of drainage works to ensure these collect from and discharge to natural drainage
lines. This may not always be possible for mitre drains and in those situations frequent,
low volume drains are preferred;
o  provision of energy dissipation devices where discharge velocities and flows will erode
downstream drainage lines;

o  minimisation of disturbed areas;
z  design and construction of erosion and sedimentation controls such as diversion banks,
filter structures (filter fences or windrowed vegetation) and sediment traps;
3  diversion of significant upstream flows around working areas;
o  undertaking progressive rehabilitation and revegetation of all slopes and disturbed areas;
and
i installation of temporary erosion control drains prior to the wet season. No new road
excavation will be commenced during the wet season.
Vegetation will be established on slopes, such as batters and roadside embankments, to prevent
localised rill erosion. Stone pitching may be required near culverts and bridges where the
embankments of the road approaches are steeper.
The project provides an opportunity to undertake the planting of trees for soil conservation
purposes along the road corridor and within existing degraded areas, particularly gullies,
barren terrain, rivers and at borrow pit sites.
4.2.3    Water Quality
i    Construction
Sedimentation and resultant water quality effects were discussed in the previous section. This
section looks at other water quality issues.
Hydrocarbons sourced from improper disposal facilities for used lubricants and poor operation
and maintenance practices for construction vehicles and machinery can contaminate surface
waters. Improper disposal of oil filters and other materials from vehicle and machinery
maintenance can also cause pollution.
Spilled petroleum fuel, as well as bitumen and explosives residue, also have a potential to
contribute to the pollution of waterbodies, but to a very minor extent.
Improper sanitation and waste disposal procedures in temporary construction camps can also
contaminate water resources.
ii    Operation
Vehicle movements and the roadside maintenance of vehicles can result in the contamination
of water resources along a road corridor by fuel and lubricants. Accidents may result in the
spillage of fuels or other products.
These potential effects already exist. Improved road conditions will improve vehicle operating
conditions. Road accidents involving accidental spills of fuel, lubricants, chemicals or other
toxic materials, which could reach waterbodies, are likely to be reduced. The effect of the road
works is therefore likely to reduce water pollution potential from these factors.

IMIPA CTO Lda -l3,Q',,S1IEC
iii    Mitigation Measures
All fuels, lubricants and bitumen will be stored in bunded areas. Vehicle maintenance and
refuelling will be confined to areas in construction camps designed to confine lubricants and
fuel spillages.
The Contractor shall ensure that all bitumen and fuel storage areas are bunded to contain at
least 120% of the maximum capacity of the largest storage tank. The floor of the bunded area
shall be impervious, and storage facilities and bunds shall be inspected weekly for spills.
Adequate waste disposal and sanitation facilities will be provided at construction camps.
Any waste water or stormwater discharged from the site shall comply with the following
objectives:
o  pH range                        6.0-9.0
o  Total Suspended Solids (TSS)    <50mg/I
o  Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)    <1500mg/I
o  Oils and surfactants            No visible film of oils or petrochemicals
4.2.4    Hydrology
i   Construction and Operation
The main construction activity that has the potential to impede flows will be the stockpiling of
materials if placed near drainage lines.
Although the road is an existing feature, it can cause an impedance to flow, alter the natural
channel position and result in increased velocities as a result of this change. The road crosses
several seasonal watercourses and two perennial rivers. Adequate provision and appropriate
placement of culverts along the road will improve cross-road drainage.
Adequate and stable cross-road and road surface drainage is essential to ensure that stormwater
run-off does not damage the road and minimises the effect of inundation caused by impeded
flows. Cross-road drainage shall be provided by causeways and culverts to pass catchment
flows past the road, either over or beneath it. Road surface drainage shall be provided by side
drains to direct run-off off the road surface.
ii   Mitigation Measures
Particular attention shall be given to stockpiling materials away from existing drainage lines
and avoid filling in wetland areas.
All designed drainage works shall be installed at the time of initial road construction to ensure
that flows along drainage lines are not impeded.
58602 Bene - Fingoe                  January 2001                                4-5

Culverts shall be laid in a direction, which is as close to the natural position of the drainage
flow.  This will avoid altering the channel flow and prevent upstream  and downstream
scouring of the watercourse.
4.2.5    Noise and Vibration
i   Construction
Additional noise will be generated along the project road corridors and at ancillary sites during
the construction period, particularly from increased numbers of heavy vehicles.
Peak noise levels generated by construction activities are expected to be greater than the peak
noise levels from, road operation. Construction noise is generally intermittent and depends on
the type of operation, location and function of the equipment and the equipment use cycle. It
attenuates quickly over distance. For example excavation noise levels, assuming bulldozer and
dump truck activity, are approximately 85dBA at 15m. This decreases by about 3-4dBA with
each doubling of distance and would be reduced to approximately 7OdBA at about 240m.
ii   Operation
As accessibility is improved after completion of the road works, vehicle noise levels may
increase slightly with an expected increase in traffic volumes. After completion of the works,
the traffic on the project road is expected to experience a high growth rate due to improved
accessibility (See Part B). Overall traffic volumes will be low probably numbering a few
hundred vehicles a day.
Noise sources and factors which may contribute to the increase in the ambient noise level and
related adverse impacts during the operation of the improved roads will include vehicle noise,
vehicle maintenance and driver behaviour (such as the use of horns).
The improved road design will allow an increase in vehicle speed and some increase in the
overall noise level is likely to result. When traffic speed doubles, this results in a 6 dB(A)
increase in noise level (Tsunokawa and Hoban, 1997). However, the project corridors are not
densely populated, and few sensitive sites, such as schools and hospitals, are expected to be
located close to the road. The majority of the road traverse cultivation land and woodland
areas. There is no potential for significant adverse noise effects.
The road works may reduce existing noise levels in built-up areas. The improvement of roads
will result in an improved road surface, which will consequently reduce noise levels through
the efficient operation of vehicles.
iii   Mitigation Measures
No national noise level standards currently exist for highway construction equipment in
Mozambique, however the World Bank recommends the use of construction equipment, which
meets international standards.

The following measures shall be implemented to minimise the impact of noise during the
construction phase:
o work compounds shall be located at least 0.5km from settlements;
o  construction activities within 150m of residential areas shall cease between 19:00 and
06:00 hours; and
Li machinery and vehicles shall be maintained and repaired regularly.
4.2.6    Air Quality
Construction
The deterioration in air quality from dust generation and vehicle emissions during road
construction will be a relatively minor environmental impact. Significant adverse effects are
not expected because of the limited duration of construction at any one site and the few
receptors. Most of the work will occur in cultivated or woodland areas.
A deterioration in air quality during road construction will primarily occur from dust generated
by road excavation, spoil transportation and disposal. In addition, most construction activities
will progressively move along the alignment, so prolonged deterioration in air quality will not
occur at any one site. The minor volumes of dust generated will cause short-term localised
problems through settlements.
Road construction workers will be exposed to minor dust emissions over the construction
period, with the quantity of dust partly dependent upon wind conditions.
ii   Operation
Exhaust emissions from traffic utilising the rehabilitated road are likely to increase due to the
high percentage increase in traffic growth expected (See Part B). Total emissions will be low
because the increase will be from a low existing traffic volume.
The level of dust is expected to reduce with rehabilitation as a result of stabilising the road
surface.
Improved road geometry will also reduce exhaust emissions along the project roads by
reducing the roughness of the road surface (particularly by removal of potholes), increasing the
design speed and reducing the need for excessive acceleration and deceleration.
iii   Mitigation Measures
Mitigation measures will be implemented in areas where air quality problems would arise due
to construction activities. Areas of concern for dust control are in settlements and sensitive
sites such as schools and hospitals.
58602 Bene - Fingoe                  January 2001                                4-7

LTIPACTO Lda (iS EC
Minimising air emissions is particularly important during the construction stage, for activities
such as the operation of borrow pits and in-sitL mixing of cement and sand, which have a
potential to generate high dust levels.
During the construction period, the following mitigation measures to suppress dust will be
implemented:
o  Water will be sprayed during the construction period at earth mixing sites, asphalt-mixing
sites, and on cleared surfaces. Water spraying will be undertaken during periods of high
wind, or when necessary, to suppress dust.
c  Operations shall be suspended during periods of dry windy weather, in areas where wind
blown dust is causing a nuisance in settlements or towns.
L  All equipment and plant machinery shall not emit visible smoke for a continuous period of
greater than 10 seconds.
L  All exhaust systems and engines on plant and equipment shall be in accordance with the
manufacturers specifications and kept well maintained to ensure that they have a high level
operating efficiency.
4.3 BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
4.3.1    Identification
i   Direct impacts
Vegetation will need to be cleared to undertake the road rehabilitation works and enable road
formation widening and construction of additional drainage. The conservation value of the
road corridor vegetation that will be cleared is not high and woodland areas crossed by the
road are utilised for slash and burn agriculture. The impact of vegetation clearing for the
construction works will not be significant due to the already degraded nature of the woodland
habitat and low conservation value.
Vegetation may also be cleared in areas selected for ancillary sites, such as construction
camps, borrow pits and quarries, to enable the utilisation of these areas.
ii   Indirect impacts
There is a potential impact associated with the indirect loss and degradation of vegetation,
habitat and species in the ROI. These potential impacts are associated with:
o improved access;
o in-migration; and
o construction workforce behaviour.
Ecological degradation of the ROI may occur from vegetation harvesting and wildlife
poaching by the construction workforce, and increased harvesting during road operation due to
greater accessibility and additional local demands from road-induced activities.
58602 Bene - Fingoe                 January 2001                               4-8

IMPA CTO LdIla                                                                vI.*SWNIEC
The projects will provide improved access to the neighbouring areas and facilitate natural
resource use. The main potential for increased natural resource harvesting is likely to occur
within the area's woodlands.
The population increase along the road corridor would be derived either from people migrating
to the roadside from the immediate area (i.e. the 5km region of influence and adjacent to this),
or from other areas. This in-migration has a potential to create an increased local demand for
fuelwood and construction timber, as well as other woodland products to support secondary
enterprise activities, such as forage collection for grazing animals. Hunting may also increase.
The proposed road improvements will follow an existing alignment and almost all woodland
areas neighbouring this road are currently accessible. The road will only increase potential
access to these areas, not open them up.
Importing a construction workforce into an area may increase demand on local natural
resources due to competition for firewood, woodland products and wildlife. These increased
demands will be focussed on the areas surrounding workforce camps and work compounds.
Worker camps may also encourage the temporary construction of markets and barracas to
service the workers. These temporary facilities may also increase demand on local natural
resources.
4.3.2    Mitigation Measures
i   Direct Impacts
Vegetation clearance along the road edge and at ancillary sites (such as borrow pits) will be
minimised. All construction areas will be clearly marked and construction activity prohibited
outside the defined areas. Trees within ancillary sites shall be retained wherever possible.
Retention of trees within areas such as worker camps will improve the camp amenity and
provide shade.
All temporarily disturbed areas will be rehabilitated following construction. The establishment
of ground cover is the initial priority of revegetation. Ground cover reduces raindrop impact,
binds the soil surface and creates a micro-climate favourable for the establishment of other
vegetation. Species should be selected for cover crops and permanent revegetation. A cover
crop consisting of a rapid growing species and several vigorous grass species should be used to
rapidly establish ground cover on disturbed areas. Permanent revegetation species should be
selected to be consistent with species native to an area.
Revegetation will aim to stabilise the disturbed areas and assist the desirable secondary uses of
natural resources including:
o production of forage, wood, flowers, fruit, medicinal items;
o shade and shelter;
o fencing and screens; and
o building supports.

Revegetation along different sections of road will be designed to achieve site-specific aims,
such as maximising shade within villages and providing a species composition that is
compatible with surrounding vegetation cover.
ii   Indirect Impacts
The most potential for indirect effects was identified to be associated with workforce camps.
This is a temporary effect but may last several years depending on the duration of the works
project. To reduce the potential for increased exploitation of natural resources the following
migration measures will be implemented. The Contractor will:
o provide and maintain adequate drinking and bathing water supplies;
o provide kerosene or other fuel source and stoves for worker use;
oi educate workers about the responsible use of natural resources; and
oi ensure workers act in a responsible manner and apply penalties for the harvesting of local
resources (wood, wildlife or wood products).
4.4 SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
4.4.1    Direct Impacts
i   Loss of agricultural land, buildings, sites of cultural value, population displacement,
and natural resources degradation
It is unlikely that any improvements to the road will require significant areas of cultivated land.
The main loss will occur at borrow pits and minor realigning of the road. It is likely that small
areas of land currently used for cultivation will be lost. Where an area of cultivated land has to
be resumed for road construction, the farmer will be compensated for loss of production. The
following process will be applied:
o where possible the farmer should be notified of the loss of land one season in advance.
This is to avoid unnecessary loss of effort and seed; and
o the value of the lost production should be determined in consultation with the District
Agricultural Officer and the local Chefe de Poste. Compensation will be paid to the farmer
for the value of the lost production.
Borrow pits, storage and equipment areas, and construction camps will be located on marginal
or disturbed land. The acquiring of land for such purposes must be subject to ANE and
Provincial approval.  In selecting land consultation must also be undertaken with local
communities and their traditional leaders as well as local authorities (at District and Ward
level).
No displacement of population is likely. Cultivation is not continuous along the road and there
is sufficient land for machambas if necessary to be realigned. It is not envisaged that there
would any displacement of population of the local population due to road improvement.

4.4.2    Indirect Impacts
i   Access to services
Improvement of the road is likely to have significant socio-economic impacts. Availability of
services to the populations of Districts is poor. An improved road would enable, for example,
sick patients to gain access to better health services. Improved road communication would
also improve access for children to higher education facilities.
ii   Improved access to markets
Poor communication has been cited as a major problem which, perhaps most importantly,
limits the ability of the local population to transport surplus agricultural production to market.
Similarly improvements to the road would enable goods and services to flow more easily into
the area particularly those associated with improving agricultural production techniques and
yields.
Fingoe town is likely to benefit significantly from road improvement. The town is remote and
the EN 221 is its principle access. Improvements to the road would reduce this travelling time
and expense for people accessing the main road to Tete and other parts of the Province.
iii   In-migration of people and concessions
The road adjoins areas identified to have a high potential for forestry. Road improvements will
enable improved access for people wanting to exploit the natural resources of the District.
Mitigation measures are necessary if these natural resources are not over exploited.
Improvement of roads in other rural areas within Mozambique leads often to increases in in-
migration as advantage is taken of the improved communication. It is probable that some in-
migration will take place particularly in areas in close proximity to the road. Regulos have an
influence in terms of the local allocation of land. Mitigating measures should involve working
with regulos and other local authorities to control any possible in-migration.
Under existing Mozambican legislation all land belongs to the State. However, private sector
farmers may acquire long-term rights over land by obtaining a Title of Use and Exploitation.
Individuals may also seek concession rights over tracts of land to harvest timber.
Requests for "concessions" are lodged with an area's Provincial Agricultural Services. Once
access to hitherto isolated areas is improved following rehabilitation of a road it could be
expected that concession seekers will attempt to access these lands.
Although, at present, all land in Mozambique belongs to the State the defacto situation is that
land is being managed and allocated according to traditional customary land rights. The
potential for conflict over land between local communities and "concession seekers" is high.
Very few traditional farmers have formalized their rights to the land under existing legislation.

Where it is expected that demand for concessions increase as a result of improved access the
existing traditional land "ownership" should be mapped within the roads region of influence.
This should be undertaken at the road design phase to reduce the later potential for conflict
between traditional landowners and concession seekers.
iv    Health issues
The improvement of the road will necessitate the inflow of a number of construction workers
from other parts of Mozambique. The inflow of road gangs particularly into remote areas has a
potential for adverse effects. The most often cited problem is the one of HIV-AIDs and
sexually transmitted diseases.  Mitigation measures against these likely impacts require
working closely with respective government departments, local NGOs and/or church based
organisations, local communities, and road gangs.  Educational programs for the local
populations are considered to be extremely important in trying to reduce the likelihood of HIV-
AlDs infection.
v    Construction worker camps
The health issues related to construction worker camps particularly in terms of the spread of
HIV-AIDs and other sexually transmitted disease have been mentioned above.   A
concentration of workers also attracts other inward migrants who attempt to exploit new
market opportunities. Such informal sites are often poorly managed in terms of adherence to
health regulations and waste disposal. Mitigation measures should include the identification of
suitable sites for the establishment of small shops and other facilities servicing road-gangs.
In conclusion road improvements to the EN221 will have significant positive impacts.
Improved communication would improve the ability of local populations to transport surplus
agricultural production to market. It would also likely to stimulate more production if farmers
knew they had a means of transporting their goods. Fingoe town would be a significant
beneficiary of road improvements as the town is relatively isolated because of the poor
condition of the existing road. The main negative socio-economic impacts relate top the
problem of the spread of HIV-AIDs infection. Campaigns in other parts of Mozambique have
demonstrated that these problems can mitigate against particularly if resources and education
are directed at the local population and not just the influx of construction workers.

5 UPGRADING AND MAINTENANCE MITIGATION
MEASURES
Design, construction and maintenance mitigation recommendations for the proposed roads
were formulated to avoid or mitigate potential biophysical impacts.
The road works will include environmental impact mitigation measures within the Contract
Specifications. These measures will be incorporated as specific instructions to the Contractor
and will be provided in a separate Environmental Management Guideline (EMG) identifying
specific instructions for the Contractor including responsibilities, outputs, costs and timing of
mitigation measures.
The EMG describes the practical means to ensure effective implementation of the mitigation
measures recommended for the potential adverse environmental impacts identified in the EIA.
The EMG will include but will not be limited to the following elements:
o  practical means to implement the recommended mitigation measures;
U implementation schedule and supervision program; and
o monitoring and evaluation.
In addition, the program also specifies what action will be taken and by whom in the event that
the proposed mitigation measures fail, either partially or totally, to achieve the level of
environmental protection expected.
An outline of the EMG for the construction and operation stage is provided in the main volume
of this report.
Specific socio-economic impact mitigation measures will include further consultation with
potentially affected land holders and provision of compensatory measures in accordance with
the current Government of Mozambique policy. These measures have been formulated by the
Department of Agriculture and include guidelines for the displacement of people and
acquisition of land for the roads.
