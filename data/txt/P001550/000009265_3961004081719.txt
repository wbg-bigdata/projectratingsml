MEMORANDUM AND RoECMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTlRNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCUTION
TO THE EXECUTIE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBIIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR A FINANCIAL INSTITllIONS DEVELOPMENT TECICAL ASSISTANCE
PROJECT
1.      I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Madagascar for SDR 4.6 million, or the equivalent of US$6.3
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years and a ten year grace period to help finance
a Financial Insttions Development Technical Assistance Project. The project is exected to be
supported with parallel financing by the United States Agency for Intenational Development (USAID),
Switzerland and the Swedish Agency for ntrnational Technical and Economic Co-operation (BfTS).
2.      Co.ntrX and   rLK l unU . With a population of about 12 million, growing at 3% per
year, and a per capita income of US$220, Madagascar is among the least developed countries in the
world. Per capita income grew modesdy in the late 1980s following stabilization, and structural
adjustment reforms implemented in the mid 1980s to rectify major economic imbalances that arose in the
1970s. The supply response was, however, smaller and slower than expeeted as reforms were incomplete
and it was undermined by political events in 1991.
3.      In the second half of the 1980s reforms in the financal sector centered on steps to strengthen
the completely state-owned banking sector, which was completely state owned and was experiencing
severe financial problems. By the end of 1989, the loan portfolios of these banks had been cleaned of
most non-performing and doubl assets. In 1990, a new, fully private bank with majority foreign
capital surted operations; in 1991, one of the sate banks was privatized and another obtained minority
private participation while two private foreign banks opened representative offices in Madagascar. In
parallel with these actions, the Central Bank embarked upon a process of replacing direct credit allocation
with a more flexible system based on indirect market instruments. These financial sector reforms have
had mixed results. The new private banks and the majority pdvaizatlon of one of the state banks has
proved successfil. Progress was less sustainable, however, in maintining the overall health of the
banking system following the portfolio clean-up of 1989, becuse the two majority state banks have
shown Increasing weaknesses since 1991. These difficulties led to a virual standstill in the interbank
money market, jeopardizing the success of a market-based system of interest rates introduced in
November 1990. The establishment of market-based interest ntes was also undemined by the suspension
of the Treasury Bill market in mid-1991. These institutional and market shortcomings have been
aggravated by the lack of concise and comparable infotmation on the health of banking institutions.
Furthermore, inadequacies In the prudential supervision syst, the accounting framework, and the
financia disclosure and audit standards for banks, prevented early detection and correction of financial
distress. At the same ime, the lack of independence of the Central Bank (BCRM) and Financial
Supevisory Commission (CCB&) has led to conduct of monetary policy and prudential oversight being
influenced by political factors.
4.      The economic strains which murfaced in 1990 were exacerbated with the onset of political
instability in 1991. Real GDP contracted by 6 percent; inflationary pressures built up; fimancial
Imbalances widened significantly; and large do.uestic and external payments arrears were accumulated.
Political disurbances in 1991 resulted in a shorfIll in tax collection and the rise in the budget deficit to
about 10 percen of GDP; in 1992, tax collecion did not improve and budgetary discipline worsened.
The tre size of the fiscal deficit was masked by the quasi-fiscal operations of the Central Bank which
since 1983 has been assuming debt-servicing obligations once borne by the Treasury. The internal
imbalances were reflected in a worsened exernal position of Madagascar, with the overall current account



-2-
deficit reaching 10% of GDP in 1992. The growing shortage of foreign exchange had led to the
suspension of the Open Genera  License system in October 1991. The lack of independence and
institutional ability of the Central Bank to independenty formdlate and conduct monetay policy, and o0
the Finacial Supervisory Commission (CCBEF) to effectively undertake prudential oversight of banks,
contributed in major part to the unraveling of macroeconomic stability. Unless these insttutional
weaknesses are addressed as first steps of an overall program of financial reform, the establishment of
a trly market-driven financW system and growth in the productive sectors will be jeopardized. In
recognition of this problem, the Goverament has recendy adopted an action program fo- financial sector
.eforms, with specific measures for immediate institutional reforms.
5.                        Thied Qbieth. le project objective is to faitate investment and growth in the
productive sectors by improving the fu-nctioning of the financial system. This is in line with the Bank's
country assistance segy which emphasizes increased prvate sector savmgs and investment as engines
of fiture growth. Ihe project aims at strengthening key financW institutions and markets in Madagascar
(including psivatization of the two remaining state banks), thereby enhancing public trust in them and
enabling them to mobilize sVinlgS to meet the investment financing needs of the private sector. The
project wiil be Implemented in the context of the Government's Statement of Financial Sector Reform and
Development Policy adopted in March 1993. Specifically, the project would aim at: (i) enhancing the
Central Bank's (BCRM) ability to formulate and conduct monetary policy based on indirect instruments;
(iH) improving the prudential supervision environment through the strengthening of the Financial
Supevisory Commssion (CCBEF); (%ii) formulating and enforcing accouting audit ad finanial
disclosure standards based on international norms; and (iv) supportng the privation of state banks.
6.      Troect Descritig.  The project is a technical assistance operation which has four
components: (i) restructuring the Central Bank (BCRM); (Hi) strengthening the Financial Supervisory
Commission (CCBEF); (il) improving the accounting and auditing framework; and (iv) support to the
privatization of state banks. Project costs and the financing plan; procurement and disbursement
arrangements; and processing events are presented in Schedules A, B, and C, respectively.
(1)     Restructuring the Cam iIk MBCRM) (US$ 8.9 million, 86% of project cost). To enable
BCRM to effectively formulate and conduct monetary policy based on indirect instruments, a sategic
development plan has been prepared and adopted by the Board of BCRM which defines overall objectives
and a business plan for the Centra Bank over a three-year period. The plan aims at establishing the
independence of BCRM and the elimination of all quasi-fiscal actvities. Ihe plan will be implemented
in the contet of revised statumes of BCRM  which have recenty been adopted by Government. The
revised stautes strengthen the Centra Bank's legal independence and removes one of the major obstacles
to its ability to pursue and maintain price stability. Ihe project will include the reform and restructring
of both the primary functions (e.g. credit/open market operations, research activities) and the support
functions (e.g. accounting, information technology) of the Centra Bank consistent with independence and
transparency in its opeations. The project wil finance consultants and resident advisers as well as
hardware and software to support the following elements of the strategic plan: 0) implementation of a
human resources development plan, establishing the manpower needs over the project period, including
a clearly defined program of nterna and externu recruitment, internal and extenal ta g, and periodic
interchange of personnel across d tments or cross-ferization and skills enhancement; and (ii) design
and implemeion of an information system throughout the Central Bank, in accordance with a clear
timetable which includes a pilot phase involving one or two key departments.
(ii)                                                            (Uengne   the Flrmca Sugevso  Comnison (CCBE    (US$ 0.6 million, 6% of
project cost). CCBEF is not a legal entity but is an independent commission chaired by the Governor
of BCRM. The supervision capacity of the CCBEF will be strengthened so that it can undertake full



-3 -
regulatory and supervision funcltioD  of fcial institutions in an enviroment of greater relian  on
indirect controls In the conduct of monetary policy and increased competition among banks on boti sides
of their balance sheets. The projeca complemeas the initiative of the Monetary and Exchange Affairs
Department in IMP to recruit and place a seasoned bank inspector in CCBEF to lead its instittional
development program. IMF was closely consulted in defining the stuctre and finctions of CCBEF and
the complementary activities to be financed by toe project, including training and equipment, such as
portable computers, and vehicles. This component will ensure that CCBEF assumes the primary role in
on and off-site surveillance of banks, which has unti now been shared with BCRM, and that CCBEF
develops adequate capacity for this purpose.
(iii)    norolirng the A=Mfuntig and Audit           (US$ 0.7 miUlion, 6% of project cost).
Tis component addresses two issues, corresponding to two sets of activities. First, improvements in
accountng and audit practices are supported to accelerate the development of the accounig profession
and to ensure the availability of reliabe financl information on enterprises based on international
standards. Training nd technical assistance activities in this area will be implemented by the Ministry
of Budget in collaboration with the Ordre des Experts Comptables et des Comptables Agres (Institute
of Chartered Accou:tants). Modifications to the existing ordinance governing the profession, which
esur  that international stndards are suoscribed to and forelgn accounting and audit firns are not
disaiminated against, were detaied during negotiations, and the promulgation of a revised ordinance is
a condtion of disbursement for tis sibcomponent. Second, m order to establish, dissemine and
implement transparent international acontng and audit procedures for commercial banks and financial
instituions, specific technical assistance and training will be provided to bankers, auditors and other
professionals. Ihe availabilit of appropriate financial information on banks also needs to accommodate
the financial supervision requirements of CCBEE so that it can adequately perform its regulatory
functions. Training and technical assistance activities in this area will be implemented by the Ministry
of Budget in collaboration with CCBEF.
(iv)    SuMlIr1tng tFie Piahimlon of Banks (USS 0.2 million, 2% of project cost). The process
of privatizing one of the two state banks, BTM, has already begun and the Government has committed
itself to a similar process for the other state bank, BFV. A strategy, detailing steps to be take witi
respect to privatzation of both barks, was agreed at negotiatics. The project will support the
privaizaton process to the point of sale by financing specialized consultant services such as for valuation
and placement of these banks widt private investors. In the course of the privatization pro. 'ss, it is
expected that all regular activities such as amnual fiancial audits will continue to be self-financed by the
banks themselves.
7.      Proeet .mglemtatl   BCRM is the implementing agency for the first two components and
the Ministies of Budget and Finance wvll implement the tird and fourth components respectively.
Components implemented by BCRM will be coordinated by a project coordinator, a new director-level
position created by BCRM to implement its strategic developmet plan, and a coordaor appoit  by
CCBEF. Ihe Central Bank and CCBEF components of the project will be guided by their respective
Strategic Development Plans (SDPs) and the compodte Human Resource and Information Technology
plans. The third component will comprise two sets on activities which will both be implemented by the
Ministy of Budget in collaboration with the Ordre des Experts Comptables et des Comptables AgrEs
in one set of activities and with CCBEF in the other (see Par 6 (ii) above). The fourth component will
be implemented by the Mistry of Finance in collaboration with BCRM. The Mnistries of Finance and
Budget, BCRM, CCBEF and IDA will jointly organize a project launch workshop immediately after
Credit effectiveness to familiarize key officials of all agencies with important aspects of the project
includig proement and disbsment procedures. The scope of the project workshop has been



-4 -
dissed with the beneficiary agencies. hnplemenation will follow monitoring indicators in Anmex 8
of the Staff Appraisal Report which were agred at negotiations, and will be evaluated accordingly during
a mid-term review to be held by September 30, 1994.
8.      XO*d        asbigll. Ihe project is aimed at strengthening key Institutions of the financial
sector - BCRM and CCBEF - through human resource and systems improvements and through increased
transparency ad accountability. These improvements are expected to have a lasting irpact on financial
stability and on the quaity of fin  ciantermediation for the benefit of private sector-based economic
growth. By strengtening these key finanil Instiions, the institutional basis will also be laid for a
viable and sustainable system of market-based interest rates and, evently, a market-based exchange
rate. About seventy BCRM and CCBEF staff, inluding all senior mnagers and department manaers
and professional staff, have been involved In the preparation of strategic development plans (SDPs) for
both Insttutions since August 1992, providing a solid basis for inteization of the objectives of both
SDPs. Furtermore, the formultion nd ipl on of M ay Generally Acceptd Accountng
Principles should ensre lasting improvments in financial disclosure by enterprises and fiani
insltDons.
9.      Lamom Flrom ,Pous IpDA Involvement. Adjustment experience in Madagascar has shown
that macroeconomic reforms have suffered setbacks, pardy due to the lack of institutional capacity to
manage monetary aggrgat to control inflation and implement market-based interest and exchange rate
policies. These deficiencies need to be tacked within a clearly articulated and systemaically implemented
oveall strategy for financia sector reforms. IDA's experience with ongoing financial intermeiiary loans
in Madagascar has also demonsrJa the need for institonal strengtening to improve the quality of
accounts and facilitate the supion of commercW banks (Cr. 1804-MAG and Cr. 2104-MAG). Key
aspects of such institutional reform and strenening have been discussed over an extended period and
agreed upon with the Government. They include CCBEF capacity to undertake effective bank
supervision, through accounting and auditig standards based on inteional norms, and the use of
market,based istumens by BCRM for conducting monetary policy. Detailed terms of reference for
consultants have already been defined (Annex 3 of the Staff Appraisal Report No. 11682-MAG). This
project is a first step in implementing an overall financial sector strategy for Madagascar. This strategy,
which has been articulated in a Statement of Finacial Sector Reform and Development Policy (Annex
1 of the Staff Appraisal Report), is in line with the Bank's recent guidelines for financial sector operations
which stress the importance of ensuring a strong institutional framework within the financial system.
10.     Rationale z MIA volvea et.  The project conforms to the Banks  country assistance
stzategy as presented to the Board on lune 9, 1992, in that It supports the coutry's key objectives to:
(i) improve macroeconomic management by strengthening formulation and execution of monetary policy,
which would entail increased Central Bank independence, with a view to promoting the productive use
of credit and conining inflation; (ii) reduce tLe role and scope of the public sector, notably in the
financial system; and (iii) promote private sector development by enhancing the quality of financial
intermediation. The project forms part of the Bank's 'core* lending program to Madagascar aimed at
capacity building. Ihe project follows 1DA's Madagac   financial sector study (Report No. 9817-MAG,
March 1992) an extensive dialogue and preparaton in close collaboration with the IMP, notably in the
areas of reviewing the BCRM stattes and the design of the CCBEF component. The project will lay
the foundations for broader finmcial sector reform to revive private savigs and investment.
11.     #d  cions. Ihe project is being implemented in the contet of a Statement of Financial
Sector Reform and Development Policy that clearly defines financial and fiscal objectives, which has been
adopted by Govemment. The Govement also has adopted revised statutes for BCRM which will ensure
its increased independence and accountability. The process of undertakdng an external audit of BCRM



-5 -
is under way and its completior is a condition of credit ffecivene. Ts fist exter  audit will lay
the gVound for regular annual audits of BCRM and publication of Its audited accounts. Governent and
the Central Bank have also a1ready agreed to: (a) annual on site inspections by CCBEF of every
commercial bank; (b) streamlined bank supervision functions between BCUM and CCD, giving the
latter prmay responsibility for these actions; and (c) proe necessary ifomatin and paticipate in
semi-annual project imple nand mid-mtem reviews to he conducted by the project codnators
and the World Bank staff to monitor progess in project execution. In addition to the extera audit of
BCRM, other conditions of Credit effeciveness are: (a) promulgation of reised statutes for BCRM; and
(b) signing of a subsidiary credit agreement between the Government and BCRM.
12.     Tnviron         n    d    Pt    Obkcve Cabgdrilhe project does not
have any adverse emironmetal Impact, and has been rated 'C'. The project will contibute to the
follbwing objective categories: (a) finaca intermediation; (b) privat sector development; and (c)
economic management, through building capacity in monetary management.
13.     Jeefits.  The major benfits of the project will derive from its conion to the
establishment of an efficient financial system, with an effective banking system at its core, which is
eeial for the development of a market-oriented economy. The project will help implement an overall
stt    for market oriented financial reforms, particularly in strengthening the frmnework for prudential
supervision, accountig and audit. In turn a sound financial system wil facilitate producdve investments
and contribute to accelerated economic growth and the creation of employment opportunites which are
key factors in poverty alleviation. Specifically, the project is expected to: Oi enhance the effeciveness
of BCRM to conduct monetary policy; (i) strengthen the prudeni supervision role of CCBEF and over
time engender greater confidence in the use of indirect controls rather than direct controls to allocate
resources; (iii) enhance the security and efficiency of financi transactions and the quality of finani
intermediation through a greater stimulu for financial savings and more efficient alocadon of capital;
and (iv) help avert future financial crise rather than simply react to them.
14.    RBids. The major risks of the project stem from the possible impact of the present tansitional
political decision-making structure on effective implemention. Successful implemention is predicated
on political will being maintained to preserve the authority of BCRM and CCBEF, respectively to
formulate and execute monetary policy and to exercise prudential oversight of banks. At the same time,
the institutional development goals for BCRM and CCBEF are complex and ambitious, including
significantly redefined business objectives and etsive use of information technology, and could be
subject to implementation slippages. These risks are mkigated by: I) the high level of commitment to
project objectives and to the project's urgency expressed by a broad spectrum of political figures and
technicians; (ii) limiting the project core to BCRM which has demonstrated continuity in its insftiutional
capacity; (di) the progress already made, by BCRM and CCBEF themselves, towards preparing this
project, indicating early ownership and internalization of project design and objectives; and (v) up-front
agreement and implementaion of key organizatonal and institonal changes necessary to execute the
project.
15.     RemmemdaLion. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit will comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

1.    Most Madagascar projects have suffred from slow diIburseme--s due pardy to generic problems,
including (a) lack of counterpart funds; @b) difficulties for project managers to access IDA fuds deposited in
special accounts opened by the Centra Bank and operated by sigaries in the Treasry; and (c) cumbersome
publicprocurement procedures due to repeated reviews by cental agencies. The siton worsened in July 1991
with the onset of political umoil. Large scale de ons and strikes paralyzed public administation and
severely disuWted economic acdvity. The country is now in a proces of political transition (elecions
undew, with a new government expected to be in place by mid-1993), wbich is still slowing project
implementation. These generic problems have affected atl projects, in additon to project-specific delays. Ihe
following projects have the most sgnificant dbrement lags:
rrndon Rehabittion PrWect (Cr. 1S9MAG). Start-p delays due to lack of adequate technial
assistance and the severiy of the above generic problems were among the main caues for slow disburs s.
Implementtion has now picked up, with a number of conats under execution. The credit is expected to be
closed by the end of 1993, when a second phase project is planned.
Ac=coudogc and NWMnaDeme  Tralning Projeet (Cr. 1661-MAG   Even though the project has atained most
of ks goals, disbursements are low due to larger than anticipated co-finncing from grans by Canada and
France. A supenrion mission currently in the field is reviewing prospects to use some of the remaining fud
and cancel those which will not be used.
1nt       Ut    {Cor      M&G1. Implementaon of this project has been delayed by a wide variety of
protlems (organizational, personal, counterpart funds, markeing). A mid-term review in March 1992, made
recommendations to redirect and streamline the project, concentrating on two key components. A supervision
mission tenatively planned for June - July 1993, will review progress with a view to reconding any futher
required actions.
Seventh Hglahwy Proct (Cr. 1905-MAG) This project was mostly affected by the generic problems of
cumbersome procurement procedures and lack of counterpart funds. Many contracts have now been signed and
disbursements are expected to increase significantly during 1993.
Ibuedte Mil Engkwdlltect (Cr0 l V-MAG .  Ihis project has suffered from delays in finaizing
agreements on legal and technical aspects of the investment and shareholder agreement, as well as on
environmental clearance by the Govermnent, during the period of political transition. Most of the credit is
expected to be cancelled on June 30, 1993.
Publle Sector Adjustment Credit (Cr. 1941-MAG). The economic reform program was negatively affected
by the political turmoil which started in mid-1991; delays in meedng the conditions for third tranche release
are the main factor preventing full disbursement. Steps must be taken to implement public enterprise reform,
to agree on a public expenditure program, and to reinstate a viable macroeconomic framework including
rigorous public finance management and a return to a liberalized system for foreign exchange allocation. The
Bank has agreed to the Government's request to extend the closing date to September 30, 1993 to allow more
time to meet the third tanche condtkions.

Economic Management and Sedal Action BProMet (Cr. 1967-M&X. Imple on of IDA-financed
cwponents has been slow, pardy due to complexity of project design. Components financed by gran from
Switzerland and UNDP were disbursing more rapidly. Following the establishment of a project execution unit,
the disbursement rate has pic"ed up and the project was redesige in October 1992 to streamline its actvities.
Nafional 4gda1mW ltese4= P ect (Cr. IA       G). 'mTe project experienced an eight-month start-up
delay in meeting credit effectiveness conditions. Project execution was disrupted in 1991 due to the political
tunmoil in the country and continues to be affected by institutional disputes. A Januay 1993 supervision
mission agreed on severa immediate actions, as well as on a project reppraisal for September 1993.
2.    Some recent breakthroughs have been made which should go some way towards addressing the generic
problems involving procurement and access to special accounts. These breakthroughs followed the Country
Implementation Review (CIR) in Antannarivo in December 1990 and a folow-up CIR in March 1992.
Government agreed to: (a) issue new regulations for procurement and use standard bidding documents which
comply with Bank guidelines; and (b) publish a decree allowing project managers to have direct access to special
accounts to be opened in commercial banks to ensure that funds for project impIementation are available as and
when needed. Standard Bank bidding documents are already being used, and arrangements are being finalized
to make the new special accounts operational for all projects. In addition, attention is being given to the
availabflity of countrpart funds for Bank projects within the conWt of public exenditure/ investment reviews,
and to identiffing areas where shifting priorities or resource constraint may necessitate restrucuring. Another
CIR will be planned soon after a new goverment, resulting from the forithcoming elections, is in place. In the
first nine months of FY93, disbursement on investment operations accelerated to US$30 million, i.e. more than
the total amount disbursed in FY92.
