3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
As stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the objective of the Financial Institutions
Development Project (FINDEP) was to facilitate investment and growth in the productive sectors
in Madagascar by improving the functioning of the financial system. This was in line with the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which emphasized increased private sector savings and
investment as engines of future growth. The project aimed at strengthening key financial
institutions and markets in Madagascar, thereby enhancing public trust in them and enabling them
to mobilize savings to meet the investment financing needs of the private sector. The project was
to be implemented in the context of the Government's Statement of Financial Reform and
Development Policy adopted in March 1993.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The project objectives were not changed during implementation.
3.3 Original Components:
The project had four original components, each with a specific objective: (i) Central Bank
Component: enhance the Central Bank's (BCM) ability to formulate and conduct monetary policy
based on indirect instruments; (ii) Banking Supervision Component: improve the prudential
supervision environment through the strengthening of the Banking Supervision Commission
(CSBF); (iii) Auditing and Accounting Component: formulate and enforce audit and financial
disclosure standards based on international norms; and (iv) Bank Privatization Component:
support the privatization of state banks.
Total cost of the project was estimated at US$10.4 million of which the World Bank total cost
was US$6.3 million i.e. 60.5% of total project cost (see table 1). That amount included the funds
to finance the four principal components and US$784,000 for PPF refinancing and unallocated
funds. Co-financiers were USAID (US$3.0 million), Switzerland (US$0.6 million), and the
Swedish Agency for International and Economic Cooperation - BITS (US$0.5 million).

3.4 Revised Components:
The project components were revised during implementation. First, the task of privatization
turned out to be more complex and costly than anticipated at appraisal. The early stages of project
implementation were marked by the financial deterioration of the two state banks (BFV and
BTM), due in large part to bad lending decisions during the period of political transition. Given
the critical importance of the divestiture process to the structural adjustment program, it was
-2-



decided to restructure another credit (APEX, Cr. 2104-MAG) to make sufficient funds available
to provide technical assistance in support of state bank privatization. Second, the Auditing and
Accounting Component was not implemented when the Government failed to comply with the
disbursement condition.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at entry is rated satisfactory.
The project conformed to the Bank's country assistance strategy (CAS) as presented to the
Board in 1992 in that it supported Madagascar's key objectives to: i) improve macroeconomic
management through increased Central Bank independence and strengthened formulation and
execution of monetary policy to promote the productive use of credit and contain inflation; ii)
reduce the role and scope of the public sector, notably in the financial sector; and iii) promote
private sector development by enhancing the quality of financial intermediation. The project was a
critical aspect of a wider program of financial reforms needed to help revive private savings and
investment.
Quality of the project design: The project was undertaken while Madagascar was in a period of
political transition. Although this transition provided the opportunity to strengthen key financial
institutions in preparation of broad economic reforms, recovery, and growth, critical risks
nonetheless remained. In particular, the risk that macroeconomic reform would not resume and
thus jeopardize any successful implementation of the project was rated high during project
appraisal. It was noted in the appraisal report that if the political transition were to last longer
than expected, any institutional capacity building undertaken with project support would have
limited application in the immediate future and consequently limited sustainability. In fact, the
period of political turbulence lasted until the mid-nineties; nonetheless, the macroeconomic reform
program did resume and its success was closely linked to improvements in financial institutions,
including the Central Bank, the Banking Commission and the two state banks, BFV and BTM.
The project chose to focus on a few key issues among several that were identified in a 1992
financial sector report. For example, the legal framework for financial transactions, and the
domestic and international payment systems were areas included in the financial report and that
the project did not address. Project design called for project management support to be provided
by a cofinancier (Sweden), which provided support initially, but the activity was subsequently
financed by IDA. In retrospect, project management activities should have been part of the
activities to be financed by IDA.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The FINDEP project was approved by the Board in May 1993, a few months before a transitional
Government stepped down in Madagascar. The credit became effective a year later, in June 1994.
The project suffered significant initial delays because political-uncertainties slowed down the
adoption of the Central Bank's new statutes which was a condition of credit effectiveness. Project
management was also undermined at the outset by problems associated with the transition such as
the appointment of a very weak governor nominated on political, rather than technical, grounds
and the departure of the initial project coordinator, who became Minister of Finance. The project
-3 -



was at risk for several years, but by the mid-term review in February 1996, the project was back
on track principally because issues of leadership and management at the Central Bank were
resolved. At the closing date of September 30, 1999, the project was rated satisfactory with
respect to achieving its main objective of improving the functioning of the financial system by
strengthening key institutions and markets. As discussed below, the expected outputs of the
project components have been largely realized.
4.2 Outputs by components:
A.   CENTRAL BANK COMPONENT:
The Central Bank component was the most important of the FINDEP project, accounting for
86% of project costs and comprising nine subcomponents to be implemented with support from
the World Bank and three cofinanciers: USAID, Switzerland, and BITS (Sweden). Activities
under the Central Bank component aimed at strengthening the operations of the Central Bank of
Madagascar (BCM) have largely been completed. BCM has been reorganized and a new
information system is in place, resulting in BCM having one of the most modern Management
Information System (MIS) in African central banks. All applications for the transfer to the new
accounting system have been developed. There was a transition period from the old "manual"
system to the new which ensured a smooth transition. As can be expected with a new system, its
capacities are still not fully utilized. The situation will improve as the newly-trained staff masters
the system. The new system is expected to improve the accuracy and delivery of accounts as well
as the management and efficiency of the Central Bank. Other accomplishments under the project
relate to the improvement in open market operations with money market and refinancing
operations of the Central Bank reformed significantly. Also, the Monetary Committee proposed
under the Project has been created and its members trained, and a monetary policy reference
manual is being finalized. (See Annex I for other Outcome/Impact Indicators).
Some difficulties were encountered in the implementation of some activities of the Central Bank
Component. Some of these difficulties were related to the choice of the accounting package to be
used because no "off the shelf' system is perfect and most commercially available software has to
be customized. In the case of BCM, the difficulties were magnified as very few staff were trained
on computers or office automation software. Therefore, the project team had to follow a
two-pronged approach consisting of first training users on the basics while supervising the project
consultant (who was focused on the customization of the accounting software and development
of division-specific applications), then training again the same users on the accounting package
and on the new accounting procedures. When compared to the experience of similar projects,
BCM did a good job in re-engineering its own accounting procedures and in absorbing as an
institution the office automation and new accounting system that was built to model the
institutional re-engineering.
There were also difficulties in establishing cooperation between the Central Bank and the
concerned departments of the Ministry of Finance to build a program to improve the management
of the public debt, a function which under other World Bank programs was to be transferred to
Treasury. The idea of purchasing the software developed by UNCTAD and implementing a
training program was not implemented. This action will be undertaken under the World Bank
supported PAIGEP project.

B.   BANKING SUPERVISION COMPONENT
Most activities in support of the Banking Supervision Commission (CSBF) have been completed
(training, technical assistance in the drafting of regulations, modernization of physical facilities
and provision of information systems). The IMF provided valuable support by assigning a
Technical Advisor to the Commission. The CSBF is now a relatively independent organization.
The technical secretariat of the commission is adequately staffed with well-trained staff. Its
reporting system and off-site inspection are adequate. It has some capabilities for on-site
inspection. This nascent capability will be, however, stretched with the increase in the number of
international banks from three to six, following the sale of two large state banks, BFV and BTM,
to Societe Generale and Bank of Africa respectively, and the licensing of a second Mauritius
bank. In the early period of project implementation, the Banking Commission introduced
regulations which were generally in line with international standards, although the Commission's
powers were limited under the 1988 Banking law. There is, to a large extent, compliance with the
Basel principles of bank supervision. The jurisdictional problems with the 1988 law were resolved
with the passage of the 1996 Banking law which gave the commission the authority to issue all
prudential rules. Most of the regulations have been prepared by the Technical Secretariat of the
Commission (e.g. capital adequacy; risk concentration; lending to shareholders and directors;
provisioning) and several have been approved such as liquidity measurement, the accounting plan
for banks and other financial institutions, and publication of accounts. Despite its new powers,
CSBF is still linked to the Central Bank which is responsible for appointing and remunerating the
staff of its technical secretariat. CSBF's independence vis-a-vis the Government and politicians has
not been tested yet, and only time will tell whether the Commission will remain impartial when
confronted with political requests and pressure to license unsuited applicants.
C.   AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING COMPONENT
The component which aimed at improving the auditing and accounting profession was not
implemented because Malagasy professionals in these fields did not want to carry out the
fundamental reforms agreed to under the Credit (specifically the need to open the profession to
new entrants in the local market, including foreign firms, in order to improve competition and
industry standards). The component was rated unsatisfactory. In 1998, the Bank decided not to
extend the closing date for this component. Although the component was not implemented, the
project team played a catalytic role in starting the dialogue that was then pursued by members of
the professional association on their own and eventually resulted in some fundamental reforms in
the accounting profession. In their written contribution to the ICR, the Professional Association
of Accountants reports that positive actions resulted from the World Bank inputs. There was, in
the end, an improvement in accounting and audit practices and in particular, the adoption of
international accounting and auditing standards. These reforms ultimately resulted in the entry of
the Malagasy accounting profession into the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) in
May 1999. The accounting and auditing profession has also opened up to the rest of the world by
allowing partnerships between local and international firms such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, and
Mazzars and Guerard.
D.   BANK PRIVATIZATION COMPONENT
The two state banks (BFV and BTM) that held 56% of all financial assets in 1990 were
- 5-



successfully privatized with technical assistance financed under the APEX project. Starting in the
late eighties, the portfolios of the two state banks were restructured in preparation for their
eventual privatization. By the mid-nineties, the state banks had a very weak financial position
largely due to some politically-motivated lending. The appointment of two expatriate technical
advisors funded by the projects as provisional administrators of the state-owned banks and
advisors in the sale of the banks produced visible results in the banking sector very quickly, and
contributed to the control of monetary expansion after 1996. Provisions and non-accrued interest
as well as non-provisioned non-performing loans fell sharply in 1998 as the result of the recovery
efforts of the state-owned banks and the restructuring of BFV portfolio before its sale to SociJti
Generale. The new bank (BFV-SG) started operations in October 1998. A restructuring of the
BTM portfolio was also done in conjunction with its sale to Bank of Africa, which began
operations in November 1999. The share of BTM and BFV in the net portfolio of the banking
system declined from 48.7% at the end of 1995 to 24.7% in April 1999. The banking system in
Madagascar is healthy today, largely because of the privatization of the two remaining state banks
and other activities financed under the APEX project. The achievements under bank privatization
were rated highly satisfactory and will be discussed in the ICR for the APEX project which closes
on June 30, 2000.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
N.A.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
N.A.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
Institutional development impact is rated substantial. The project's most important objective was
to improve the functioning of the financial system with a heavy emphasis on restructuring the
Central Bank (86% of project cost) to enable the institution to formulate and conduct monetary
policy based on indirect instruments. Thus, during the life of the project, the Central Bank was
reorganized, its systems modernized and BCM shifted from direct to indirect methods of
monetary control. Directed credit was eliminated. Credit ceilings for commercial banks were
abolished, and reserve requirements became the key instrument of credit control in 1995. The
reserve requirement system was also modified to be based on deposits rather than credit. The
system of reserve requirements has been successful in controlling inflationary pressures and
reducing bank liquidity. However, despite very significant gains in the conduct of monetary
policy, there remains areas of improvement. Reserve requirements impose a penalty on banks and
discourage deposits. The remuneration of reserves beyond a certain level should, thus, be
considered by the Central Bank. BCM should also monitor the evolution of the effective reserve
requirement rate to determine the effect of reserve rate differentials. Poor communication between
the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank remains a constraint on monetary policy and should
be improved. The management of domestic debt, which was not a main focus of the project, has
been a source of concern, and some support was started by the IMF, USAID and the World Bank
under PAIGEP project. Improvements in domestic debt management, including in the Treasury
bill system will need to be addressed in future operations of the Bank and is in the agenda of the
IMF.
-6 -



The project had an important impact on the legal framework starting with the adoption of the
Central Bank's new statutes as a condition of credit effectiveness. The legislation gave the
Central Bank a large measure of independence with regard to the implementation of monetary and
credit policies. To protect that independence, direct advances to the Government by the Central
Bank are limited to 15% of the Government ordinary revenues, while the holding of treasury bills
by the Central Bank is subject to a separate ceiling of 10% of the same revenues. Also, the
enactment of the new Banking Law in 1996 during project implementation reinforced the powers
of Banking and Supervision Commission and allowed the institution to improve its supervision of
financial institutions. Today, CSBF has administrative, licensing, regulatory and supervisory
authority on all financial institutions which mobilize deposits and/or grant loans. Another credit
effectiveness condition was the external audit of the Central Bank. The Central Bank has been
externally audited every year since that time and the project achieved its goal of creating an
independent audit unit within the Central Bank. Today the Central Bank is a much more
independent institution, freer from govermnent pressure to formulate monetary policy than it was
at the start of the project. Over the past year, it has had to increase its lending to Government
over the statutory limit but auditors note that this was done with IMF approval under exceptional
circumstances.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5. 1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
N.A.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The Accounting and Audit Profession component of the project was not implemented because the
condition for disbursement was never met. That condition included the modification of the
existing ordinance governing the profession of Accountants and Auditors to ensure that
international standards are adhered to, as well as the opening of the profession to newcomers
including foreign firms. The Government found it difficult to overcome the resistance to change
of the established accounting and auditing profession.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The Central Bank could have avoided some delays in implementation of the new MIS system by
taking appropriate actions on time. It is likely that some of the delays in decision-making,
including staffing, resulted from natural concerns by the Management of the Central Bank about
the complexity of the system re-engineering tasks which accompanied the reorganization of the
Central Bank and the introduction of a new accounting system. Also, the Central Bank's view
that the international consultant in charge of system's change underestimated the task could be
correct. As a result of the delays, the closing date of the credit had to be extended one year until
September 30, 1999.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
During project implementation, several changes in the components affected final project cost and
financing: (see Annex 2: Project Costs and Financing). Funds originally allocated to the
Accounting and Audit component were reallocated to the Central Bank Component. Activities
-7-



under the Bank Privatization component were financed under APEX, Cr. 2104-MAG and the
funds originally allocated under FINDEP remained undisbursed. At closing, US$712 ,000 of the
US$6.3 million credit amount was not committed. All undisbursed amounts will be canceled.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability of the project is likely. Institutional and legal reforms initiated under this project
have helped create the environment for a modern and competitive banking system. The revision
of the Central Bank statutes has given the institution new powers and independence in the
formulation and implementation of monetary and credit policy. Government commitment to
pursue reforms in the financial sector has resulted in its disengagement from bank ownership with
the effective privatization of both state banks. Although the full impact of bank privatization will
only be known in the medium to long run, the improved management of public banks during the
divestiture process and their subsequent sale has contributed to increased efficiency in the
financial system. It may be too early to detect a clear trend, partly because fiscal imperatives
continue to dominate interest rate trends, but increased efficiency is already reflected in reduced
intermediation margins and a downward pressure on interest rates. Also, the tight supervision of
the state banks during the three-year divestiture process reduced significantly the potential losses
of the banks. Today, the banking system remains healthy with non-performing loans estimated at
less than 5% of the gross loan portfolio and almost fully provisioned. Until the end of 1999, when
the sector was last reviewed, the interbank foreign exchange market established in 1994 has
worked fairly well and government interventions have been minimal. Treasury bill holdings
outside of the financial system increased rapidly since 1998 because of the broadening of the
access to the primary market and pressure on some state-owned companies to shift from time
deposits to treasury bills. The project helped CSBF build its capacity for bank supervision. This
was achieved with parallel support from the IMF who provided a technical assistant in
supervision. In November 1999, the IMF conducted an assessment of the Central Bank with an
expert from Bank of France. On the basis of this review, the IMF plans to provide additional
technical assistance to build the internal audit capacity of the Central Bank and of CSBF to carry
out on off-site and on-site supervisions.
The justice system was not an area pursued by the project but remains a key obstacle for the
financial sector. Court decisions regarding financial matters and especially in loan recovery
procedures are too often arbitrary. Procedures to seize and dispose of mortgage goods and to
execute judgments are too slow and too expensive. The World Bank's support for business law
reforms, including those relating to the operations of financial institutions were initiated under the
PAIGEP and Private Sector Support (PATESP) projects. Some issues relating to guarantees are
being studied under the Microfinance Project. The legal/judicial reform program will continue to
be a priority and should be considered under private and/or financial sector operations. Further
support of the World Bank in the financial sector, such as insurance and the institutionalization of
the savings bank will be discussed over the coming months. The IMF plans to continue its
support for Banking supervision and the internal audit function of the Central Bank. Assistance is
also required in debt management, where much work remains to be done.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations.
- 8 -



Steps have been taken to ensure that project outcomes are sustainable, including training for
management and key staff at the Central Bank and CSBF. Thus, members of a newly-created
Monetary Committee have all been trained as well as staff at CSBF responsible for bank
supervision. Users of the new accounting system at the Central Bank have been trained and new
staff has been appointed in the completely restructured accounting and IT departments. Smooth
transition to regular and more efficient operations has also been made possible by providing the
Central Bank with the proper computer equipment for its future operations. Most of the divisions
of the Central Bank are now equipped with modern and efficient hardware and software as the
result of the project. The Central Bank also took the necessary steps to ensure Y2K compliance
of the system, and no difficulties were reported for the passage to the year 2000.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
Bank performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project was satisfactory.
The Bank identified a project that was consistent with the government development priorities
reflected in the Government Statement of Financial Sector Reform and Development. It was also
consistent with the Bank's CAS for Madagascar which emphasized increased private sector
savings and investments as engines of growth. In fact, identification of a potential project started
as early as 1991, with a World Bank mission to Madagascar to undertake the first phase of the
Financial Sector Development Study. The study identifies several areas of intervention at the time.
A World Bank project preparation mission in November 1992 was made up of a large
delegation of Bank Staff and consultants (nine members in total) working alongside the Central
Bank authorities organized with the help of a small supervisory group formed just a few months
before. There was a high degree of involvement of managers and senior staff of all Central Bank
departments at all stages of project preparation, ensuring early borrower ownership of the project.
The project appraisal mission took place in March 1993 at which time the Government of
Madagascar demonstrated its commitment to the project with the adoption of a policy statement
of comprehensive program of financial reforms. The actions of the policy statement closely
matched what would be adopted as components of the project. Then, the Central Bank, which
would serve as the implementing agency of the project, signaled its readiness and commitment by
appointing a project coordinator. Bank cooperation with other partners was confirmed with
commitment from USAID, the Swiss and Swedish Governments to support the project through
parallel financing. Also the collaboration and link of the project with the IMF actions was made
clear with discussions with the Central Bank on the revision of its statutes based on comments
given by the IMF a few months before. The revision of the Central Bank statutes became a
condition of effectiveness.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank performance in supervision of the project was satisfactory. The project benefited from
frequent supervision missions (at least two per year) involving Bank Staff, cofinancier staff and
-9-



diverse expert consultants in monetary policy and banking supervision to evaluate progress in
project implementation. This was accomplished with a tight supervision budget. Performance
ratings of the project were realistic. The project was judged unsatisfactory in the beginning due to
political uncertainty and inadequate project management by the implementing agency. The Bank
team upgraded project rating to satisfactory by the mid-term review after new management was
appointed at the Central Bank and the project made significant progress. Overall, implementation
problems and progress were well identified and follow up actions were taken, such as dropping
the auditing and accounting component after several attempts were made to allow the
Government to reach an understanding with the Audit and Accounting profession. Also funds
were judiciously reallocated to components that appeared to be underfunded.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.
The project benefited from extensive preparation and with a close supervision, the Bank team was
able to address problems when they arose and take corrective actions. The team also proved very
creative by taking advantage of some situations such as restructuring an existing underutilized
credit to provide complementary financing to a key component of the project. It is worth noting
that the project team coordinated closely with the Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department of
the IMF in the implementation of the Central Bank and Banking Supervision Commission
components. The IM1F assigned a technical advisor to the Banking Commission, whose tenure has
largely coincided with project implementation. The project team also worked closely with other
donors.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower showed early interest in the possibility of a World Bank project that would address
institutional issues faced by the Central Bank and weaknesses in the financial sector. Preparation
of the project by the borrower was satisfactory. The World Bank team had several preparation
missions and discussions with the authorities. In fact, by the time of pre-appraisal of the project,
the borrower had already adopted a policy statement on which the project was going to be based,
showing commitment to the future project.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government implementation performance was satisfactory overall except for the accounting and
auditing component.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The project suffered some delays in the beginning due to weak day-to-day and senior management
at the implementing agency, i.e., the Central Bank, during the political transition and the Bank
considered cancellation of the credit. However, the Government appointed a Governor who
showed commitment to Central Bank reforms and who in turn appointed a very capable project
management team who implemented this complex project efficiently.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall, borrower performance was satisfactory once a new governor and new management of the
project were in place.

8. Lessons Learned
Several lessons learnt from the implementation of this project can be structured along the
following lines:
1. Selectivity/Prioritization of Issues and Bank Team Strength
The project team was wise to focus on some key issues in the myriad of activities to be
undertaken in the financial sector in Madagascar. Thus, other complex issues such as payment
systems via Gyro banks and legal framework for financial transactions were not included in the
FINDEP project. Experience in this project demonstrates that a strong multi-disciplinary World
Bank team, able to react with agility to problems as they arise and who has a close relationship
with the implementing agency is critical to project's success. The strength of the World Bank
team can be attributed to the varied activities and programs in the financial sector which were
being introduced in the mid-nineties (measures in the SAL; two investment operations in the
portfolio and one under preparation). For instance, the World Bank tearn was able to provide
support in the complex area of procurement of information systems. In spite of efforts on both
the government and World Bank sides, the selection of consultants and subsequently the
procurement of software and hardware proved time-consuming. Experience under this project
would argue for caution in the inclusion of small IT components in projects which cannot have
adequate supervision.
2. Continued Project retooling
The Bank team reacted well to developing situations and took appropriate actions when needed.
The Bank Privatization Component was judiciously moved to another project which had more
funds. Also, the Management of External Debt under the Central Bank Component has been
passed on to another World Bank project, i.e. PAIGEP. That move would ensure that the activity
gets done by a project suited to handle it. The accounting and auditing component was abandoned
after long discussions showed that required changes could not be introduced in time to finance the
selected activities under the credit. The World Bank team learned that it is difficult to introduce
major policy changes through a technical assistance operation. A more appropriate instrument
would have been a SAL which was not available at the time of the project.
3. Collaboration with Partners and Co-financiers
The Central Bank and the World Bank team sustained a successful working relationship with
several other co-financiers (USAID, BITS, Government of Switzerland) and the IMF. The World
Bank team kept close ties with the other co-financiers, some of whom were unable to carry out all
the activities they had originally planned. The World Bank, then, stepped in to continue the
activities. Project supervision was thorough and close interaction with the Borrower proved vital
to project's success.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
The Central Bank of Madagascar (BCM):
The Central Bank of Madagascar was the implementing agency for the BCM Component of the
project for which they provided a summary report (see attachment). BCM credits FINDEP with
- 11 -



attaining one of its most important goals among the many others accomplished by the project: the
implementation of new methods of information technology. Thanks to the project, BCM
possesses today one of the most modern MIS systems in Africa, comparable to even European
Central Banks such as the Bank of France. The new system allows BCM to not only have a
reliable accounting system but to generate management information as well. Although it is
premature to measure the impact of FINDEP at this point, the report points out that the project
yielded very positive results for the Central Bank and started an irreversible development process.
The Banking and Supervision Commission (CSBF):
CSBF was responsible for implementing the Strengthening of the Banking Supervision
component. In its written contribution (see attachment), CSBF stated that project objectives were
well defined, although some were not achieved. The project financed computer equipment,
software and hardware as well as vehicles that CSBF says greatly increased its supervisory and
inspection abilities. CSBF staff participated also in several training activities provided by the
project. However, the agency thinks that it could have taken advantage of more training
opportunities if it had been more proactive instead of relying on proposals from the Central Bank.
In evaluating World Bank performance, CSBF noted a difficult relationship with the Bank at first.
The relationship became satisfactory once better communications were established with project
managers.
(b) Cofinanciers:
USAED:
Through its Financial Market Development Project, USAID agreed to assist the Research
Department of the Central Bank by financing short term technical assistance, an expatriate
research advisor and in-country training courses. Equipment and training were also provided to
enable Internet connection. In addition, this Project supported human resource development at the
Central Bank through short technical assistance and training. According to USAID's report, their
experience with the project was very satisfactory. The staff at the Central Bank proved
exceptionally professional and exacting. Their appropriate quality requirements for the nature of
external assistance has contributed significantly to the Central Bank's ability to apply sound
monetary stabilization policies and reduce inflation. This also helped enable the successful
introduction of a secondary T-bill market. This commitment to getting the best results from
external offers of assistance was also reflected in their effective coordination of a successful MIS
upgrading effort.
The Swiss Government:
The Swiss Government had committed US$0.6 million for Foreign Exchange and Internal Audit
subcomponents of the Central Bank Component. In their written contribution to this ICR, the
Swiss Cooperation indicates that the Foreign Exchange subcomponent objectives were mostly
achieved except for the rododater which was not installed. Several Central Bank employees
benefited from training in Madagascar and abroad in Switzerland and France. The Swiss
Cooperation also financed a Foreign Exchange room at the Central Bank as well as a two-year
subscription to "Reuters" services. The Swiss cooperation recognizes that some delays in
implementation, especially with respect to training abroad, were due to a Swiss decision to
- 12 -



suspend all its training activities after the murder of a manager of a Swiss road project in July
1996. All activities resumed, however, by the end of January 1997. Nonetheless, the Internal
Audit Subcomponent was not fully implemented by the Swiss as originally planned. The
subcomponent called for technical assistance for an internal audit unit but, according to the Swiss,
the conditions required to start the activity were never met on time. The activity, including the
creation of an audit unit and reinforcement of control procedures, was later completed with World
Bank/IDA financing.
BITS
Project Management Capacity activity was to be financed by the Swedish Agency for
International Technical and Economic Cooperation (BITS) who was expected to finance
consulting services to help the Central Bank in project planning and execution and provide
support for overseas training and study visits. A number of missions took place until December
1994 aimed at providing assistance to the Central Bank in business analysis, project planning and
management, and advice on strategies and a master plan in information systems. BITS ended its
assistance in 1995 citing a lack of funds and restructuring of Swedish cooperation agencies. The
World Bank, then, provided the financing for the technical assistance in project planning and
management as well as for the preparation of the master plan. BITS did not provide comments for
this completion report.
(c) Other partners (NGOs/private sector):
The Auditing and Accounting Profession component of the project was not implemented because
thie professionals in these fields failed to undertake the required reforms. Nevertheless, the
Association of Auditors and Accountants (OECCAM) with whom several discussions with Bank
Staff took place, provided a written contribution to the ICR. OECCAM points out that it included
in its 1999 program several of the activities that failed to be realized under the project. These
included: (i) Update of accounting principles and annotated 1987 Guide to be submitted to the
Accounting Superior Council; (ii) Drafting and publication of Auditing norms; (iii) Formal
adoption of the code of ethics and deontology; (iv) Unification of the Expert financial accountants
and Certified accountants professions; (v) Set up of the first professional examination; (vi) Studies
to determine the country's needs for professional accountants for the next five years; (vii)
Clarification of the texts giving OECCAM the exclusive rights to intervene in some areas; (viii)
Measures taken for the defense of the profession, internally (respect of technical norms, personal
ethic et professional deontology) as well as externally (illegal practice of the profession); and (ix)
Quality control, especially in the management of case files.

The Central Bank actual estimates include $4.9 million from IDA and $1.8 million from co-financiers.
Banking Supervision Component costs were less than estimated at appraisal ($0.20 million vs. $0.58
million) because quite a few activities originally planned under this component were finally undertaken
under the Central Bank component which received an increase in IDA funds from $4.2 million to $5.4
million. Of that amount, 5.1 million were disbursed for the BCM component as of March 29, 2000.

Borrower's Contribution to the Project Implementation Report on the
Financial Institutions Development Technical Assistance Project - FINDEP
(Credit No. 2497-MAG)
Objectives of FINDEP
FINDEP was designed to constitute the first phase of the overall program to reform and develop
the financial system adopted by the Government on March 3, 1993. The objectives of this program were
to:
-     improve the regulatory, legal, and accounting environment in order to ensure the security
of contracts and financial instruments and the sound management of financial institutions
consistent with internationally accepted standards of prudence and transparency;
-     make the transition to a monetary policy based on indirect instruments enabling the
Central Bank to finally eliminate the credit ceilings allocated to the individual banks;
-     strengthen the market mechanisms with increased competition resulting from the entry of
new private institutions operating within an appropriate regulatory framework;
-     encourage the creation of a money and capital market, one of the initial aims being to
establish a more efficient structure for issuing and trading in Treasury bills (hand in hand
with the placing of strict ceilings on debt instruments and government paper held by the
BCM), followed gradually by the issue of financial instruments by private financial
and/or non-financial institutions and enterprises;
-     promote market-based interest rates in line with the increased  competition and the
development of a regulatory framework better suited to the market.
This first phase was geared primarily towards the institutional strengthening of the
financial system, as described below:
-     strengthening of the independence of the Central Bank and of its institutional resources
for formulating and implementing monetary and exchange policy through the use of
indirect instruments;
-     restructuring of the financial institutions and government divestiture of its equity
holdings in the financial institutions, specifically the primary banks;
-     strengthening of the supervision of banks and financial establishments, and adaptation of
the regulatory framework.
Project description
FINDEP initially consisted of four components:
Part A: Central Bank of Madagascar (BCM)



Under this component, FINDEP sought to support the strengthening of BCM's capacities
for formulating and implementing monetary and exchange policy through the following actions:
(a)    strengthening of the Research Department, particularly in its functions of data analysis
and policy definition;
(b)   improvement of open market operations;
(c)   improvement of information and accounting systems relative to the management of
foreign exchange operations and foreign currency transactions;
(d)    more efficient management of bank notes and coins and the payment system;
(e)   introduction of improved accounting systems and procedures to facilitate better
monitoring and supervision of accounting functions;
(f)    creation and use of an internal audit unit with responsibilities other than that of prudential
supervision of financial institutions;
(g)   improvement: (i) of systems of administration and information to strengthen institutional
capacities; and (ii) of external debt management;
(h)    preparation of a study of human resources and of a development plan for BCM staff;
(i)    provision of project management assistance.
Part B: Banking and Financial Supervisory Commission (CSBF, formerly CCBEF)
The purpose of this component was to strengthen CSBF's capacities in the area of
prudential supervision of financial institutions, including systematic on-site inspection of the
commercial banks.
Part C: Audits and accounts
The objective of Part C of FINDEP was to facilitate the introduction of international
accounting standards and the publication of financial data, as well as measures to facilitate
implementation of the regulatory framework and modification of the regulations to promote rapid
development of the accounting profession in Madagascar.
Part D: Support for bank privatization
This part relates to the privatization of two banks, BTM and BFV.
Project implementation
In general, there was some difficulty in getting FINDEP off the ground, due to postponement of
the effective date of Credit No. 2497-MAG. This postponement was the result of delays in complying
with the conditions of effectiveness following changes that affected various of the country's institutions.
The credit, originally scheduled to become effective 120 days after September 20, 1993, the date of
signature of the Credit Agreement, did not actually come into effect until June 23, 1994, following the
2



receipt by IDA of a copy of the Official Gazette publishing the law containing the new statutes of the
Central Bank of Madagascar. By then, IDA had already extended the effective date three times.
During implementation, the project components underwent some modifications, as described
below:
(1)    Of the sum of SDR 150,000 allocated to the "Privatization of Banks" component, only
the equivalent of SDR 87,210.70 (US$120,000) was disbursed by way of a contribution
to the financing of the fees of the two technical assistants to the BFV's Managing
Director. The activities in connection with the process of govemment divestiture from
the two public banks were mainly supported by funds from the APEX credit (Credit No.
2104-MAG), culminating in the creation of two banks under private management (BFV--
Societe Generale, on November 18, 1998, and BTM - Bank of Africa, on November 25,
1999).
(2)    Given that the amendment to Law No. 096-19 of September 23, 1996 on the accounting
profession, representing one of the prior conditions for disbursement under the "Auditing
and Accounting" component, did not materialize, the sum of SDR 380,000 allocated
under the Credit to this subproject was not used, even though IDA and the concemed
Malagasy officials continued discussions on this component throughout the entire life of
FINDEP.
Given these circumstances, and despite the original plan, FINDEP's area of implementation was
basically reduced to Parts A and B.
Implementation of the Central Bank Component of FINDEP (Part A)
To implement this part of the project, the BCM was supported by four institutions: IDA, USAID,
Swiss Development Cooperation, and the Swedish Board for Investment and Technical Support - BITS.
Following reallocation of the FINDEP credit funds, IDA earmarked the largest portion for
implementation of Part A (approximately 85 percent, or SDR 3,925,000, out of a total of SDR 4,600,000).
The original amount allocated to the BCM represented 65.43 percent of the credit, or SDR 3,010,000.
Progress of the project
Implementation of Part A of the project can be divided into two periods. The first period ran
from October 1993 (the month FINDEP was officially launched) to December 1995 (month of the
first measure taken to strengthen the project management structure -note de service No. 069/95-
GV/N of December 19, 1995). The second period started in December 1995.
Progress of the project during the first period
The enactment in June 1994 of the law containing the new statutes of the BCM in theory
facilitated the achievement of two objectives defined in the appraisal report: make the BCM independent
of the Government, and limit its responsibilities to maintenance of the internal and external stability of the
national currency.
3



It was, however, acknowledged that the BCM would not truly acquire such independence until it
proves its competence in the matter of formulation and execution of monetary policy through indirect
instruments (the third objective of the BCM component).
The strengthening of BCM's capabilities was to take place through strengthening of the primary
departments (studies and research, credit, foreign operations, financial operations) and of certain
operational departments entrusted with supporting the work of the primary departments (accounting,
internal audit, human resources). Furthermore, the BCM could not become fully operational without the
installation of a modern and efficient information system.
Given this approach, the following actions were carried out during the first period of FINDEP
implementation:
Emergency actions
-     adoption of an interim solution in the form of rental of a DPS 7000 computer from the
Bull Company to take over from the existing, now obsolete, data processing system;
-     holding of intemational competitive bidding for procurement and installation of the first
batch of computer hardware;
-     studies on information systems security and training of staff in that field;
-     initial steps toward establishing a new computerized accounting system: selection of an
accounting software package appropriate to the BCM's requirements (based on
specifications drawn up by an accounting consultant);
-     strengthening of the Organization and Informatics Department through the hiring of a
seasoned computer specialist as Director, and the hiring of a foreign consulting firm to
select the necessary tools (including development tools) and train the staff to use them;
-     preparation of a training program, and launching part of that program, with assistance
from USAID (English language training, on-site training designed to raise the level of
general knowledge of mid-level professionals in various disciplines related to BCM's
activities: management, economics, and finance, with training abroad for a few higher
level professionals);
-     diagnostic study of the system of management of bank notes and coins;
-     installation of a full-time technical assistance service, and short-term missions of two
technical assistants at the Research Department;
-     Swiss Development Cooperation mission to assist the Inspection Department and train
foreign exchange traders (theory courses);
-     auditing of BCM  accounts by independent consultants under a multi-year contract
approved by the World Bank.
Until the end of 1994, the BCM was receiving assistance in implementation and
management of projects in general and of information systems projects in particular from a firm
4



of consultants based in Sweden (CAP Programator), financed by the Swedish Board for
Investment and Technical Support (BITS).
However, this assistance did not yield satisfactory results in terms of either the project's
planning or its progress. This performance was mainly due to the difficulties in communication
experienced by CAP Programator's principal consultant (inadequate knowledge of the BCM's
working language making it difficult to pass on the work methodology) and the fact that the
experts stayed on the site for too short a time to effectively assist in the design and
implementation of project activities.
In 1995, when continued BITS support appeared uncertain, new initiatives were taken
with a view to improving project performance:
preparation of the Informatics Master Plan with the help of an external consulting firm
self-financed by the BCM (this Master Plan was validated in September 1995);
-     launching of an international process to hire a consulting firm with recognized experience
in Central Bank organization to provide full-time assistance geared to implementation of
this particular project. The contract with SETYM International was signed on October 6,
1995, and the full-time expert came on board on November 6, 1995;
-     strengthening of the project management structure. Note de service No. 069/95/GVIN of
December 19, 1995 spelled out the different levels of responsibility in the area of
decision-making, and confirmed the involvement of the BCM's most senior staff in
implementation of the Project in general and of the Informatics Master Plan in particular;
-     hiring of an independent consultant to help select the principal contractor for
implementation of the Informatics Master Plan, and subsequently to serve as delegated
project authority in implementing that Master Plan. The consultant was hired on May 6,
1997, and his assignment, entirely self-financed by the BCM, ended in December 1999.
On August 11, 1997, the General Manager's office entrusted the consultant with
responsibility for the Computerization Project within the FINDEP framework.
Progress of the project during the second period
This second period, if one may call it so , represented a new departure for the project. It
differed from the first period (1993-95) in that the Central Bank received full-time technical
assistance (TA) in project management.
Generally speaking, the TA mission essentially comprised two components: project
implementation, with all that  implies in terms of organization, management, planning,
monitoring and supervision, and the transfer of know-how to Central Bank staff.
Working together with the Bank authorities, the technical assistants first set up an
organizational structure to manage and run FINDEP. This structure would centralize all project
activities, thereby improving coordination, and would have the necessary authority to take and
apply project-related decisions.
The organizational structure to manage and run FINDEP was put in place in December,
1995. A note de service (No. 069/95-GV/N of December 19, 1995) was circulated with the
official announcement of its creation and of the roles and functions of each of its three levels,
5



namely: (1) the Supervisory Committee, which would take strategic decisions and determine the
project's principal orientations; (2) the Coordination Unit, which would coordinate, monitor and
supervise the progress of project activities, acting on the operational and tactical side of the
project; (3) the project teams, which would carry out and execute those activities.
In the preliminary phase, before appointment of the project teams, the Coordination Unit
made an appraisal and diagnostic study of the situation. It was necessary to redefine projects,
identify priorities, harmonize objectives, review budgets and resources, establish new
orientations, etc.
At the end of this phase, during which all the departments concerned were consulted, a
list of projects was drawn up based on the Central Bank's overall objective. With the projects
thus redefined, it was possible to formulate a plan of action and to set up the appropriate project
teams.
Several projects were identified, covering virtually all of the Central Bank's departments.
Among those, the project to implement an information system, focusing in particular on the
accounting and financial system, was assigned top priority.
Implementation of the accounting information system required:
*     assignment of an accounting expert to review all of the Central Bank's accounting
system;
-     accounting software;
-     assignment of an information systems expert.
With respect to the first of these requirements, an accounting expert was already working
at the Central Bank, and was able to contribute to the definition and design of the new accounting
system. The choice of accounting software was thus dependent on his recommendations.
During 1996, the project showed no positive developments.  This period was
characterized by clashes of opinions concerning the design of the new computerized system. The
development strategy recommended by the person in charge of the BCM's computerization
project consisted of developing in-house packages and conflicted with the strategy of purchasing
software packages on the market. This last option was not only consistent with the new
accounting system defined by the expert but also represented fewer risks for the Central Bank.
Moreover, the costs of the first option could be considerable, given the number of man/months
required to work on the developments.
This situation held up the project considerably since the task to research and evaluate
accounting software packages did not take place, and the actions to hire the principal contractor
were called off. It was therefore necessary to start the process of software package selection and
hiring of the principal contractor all over again, thereby substantially delaying progress.
The year 1997 marked a turning point for FINDEP. The Central Bank took the
necessary steps to get past the holdup, the accounting software packages were finally selected,
and the principal contractor was hired.
The inventory carried out in collaboration with the principal contractor revealed, on the
one hand, that the Informatics Master Plan needed to be updated with more specifics, and, on the
other hand, that a functional analysis of the accounting system was necessary before any steps
6



could be taken towards computerization. The work of writing transaction data sheets, the basis of
the new accounting system, was then undertaken. These sheets listed all of the Central Bank's
transactions, describing the associated accounting plans and the accounts involved.
In parallel with these activities, other tasks were initiated in 1998, some directly and
some indirectly linked to accounting. These included editing of the annotated Plan of Accounts,
redefinition of the accounting system organization, reorganization at general management level,
etc.
Following the revision of the Informatics Master Plan, the writing of transaction data
sheets, and the procurement of accounting software packages, teams of application developers
were set up: one an internal BCM team and one a team provided by the principal contractor, this
latter team being in charge of overall integration of the applications.
The information technology developments took longer than planned for various reasons,
including:
-     the ongoing evolution of the transaction data sheets throughout the period, leading to
several revisions of the applications;
-     the gradual pace at which the new system was mastered both by the users and by the
computer specialists;
-     slow development of user involvement, collaboration and interest in the new system;
-     underestimation of the workload.
As the work progressed, plans were made to meet the upcoming computer equipment
needs. For instance, the Office Technology Plan was organized in preparation for deployment of
the information system. This was used by those preparing the specifications and bidding
documents for the procurement of computer hardware.
The year 1999 was characterized by the transition from the old to the new system, which
has become BCM's official system. Following several months of tests, the old system was
dismantled and finally abandoned.
Accomplishment of objectives
FINDEP underwent several changes over its lifetime. Inevitably, these changes had an
impact on its orientation. It is therefore difficult to assess the accomplishment of FINDEP's
objectives without taking account of the vicissitudes it experienced.
Furthermore, FINDEP is more than a project. It was a program composed of several
projects within the BCM. Thus an assessment of accomplishment of objectives could be
conducted for each project. However, while some of these projects were carried to completion,
others were not, and still others were abandoned.
Nevertheless, if we consider the basic objective, namely modernization of the Central
Bank and improvements in its performance and capacities, in terms both of its management and
of its role on the macroeconomic scene, we may consider that objective accomplished.
Within the FINDEP framework, almost all of the Central Bank's managers and staff have
received training in various areas (macroeconomics, data processing, finance, accounting,
7



inspection, audit, exchange operations, human resources, project management, administration,
etc.).
It is difficult in the short term to evaluate the effect of this training on staff performance,
but there is no doubt that the changes brought about by the project (internal reorganization, office
technology deployment, etc.) will enable the Central Bank to make good use of the lessons
imparted.
By way of example, the computer specialists trained within the project framework have
developed applications for the Central Bank, and will be assuming responsibility for maintenance
and development of the new information system.
As another example, the members of the Operational Liaison Committee [Comite de
Liaison Operationnelle - CLO], following their macroeconomics training, are now able to
produce macroeconomic reports and analyses pertinent to monetary policy formulation. The CLO
is currently preparing the monetary policy reference document.
The renewal of the bank's computer equipment has resulted in an increase in the number
of machines and the consequent provision of computers to a large number of professionals,
enabling them to make use of the microcomputing training they have received. There is also
increasing use of word processing and spreadsheet programs.
In addition to the training, transfers of knowledge and know-how were constantly taking
place throughout the project thanks to the presence in the Central Bank of full-time technical
assistants. The consultants worked closely with the staff. All their work was performed with the
active participation of BCM personnel.
In terms of equipment and organization, we would note several changes and
improvements achieved by the project that contributed to accomplishment of the objective of
Central Bank modernization, namely:
-     Setting up a new accounting and financial information system;
-     installation of the new system  at the branch offices, with direct connection to
headquarters;
-     a new accounting organization with new services;
-     a new Internal Audit Department;
-     renewal of computer equipment (hardware and software);
-     Internet anid Intranet access;
-     new processing and management system for the Documentation Center;
-     creation of a foreign exchange trading floor;
-     improvement of open market operations;
-     setting up a business information system.
On the other hand, certain projects that would have also contributed to accomplishment
of the overall objective were not carried out or not completed, including:
-     human resource management. A diagnostic study was carried out, but there has not been
any follow-up action to carry out the recommendations;
-     external debt management.
8



The undertaking of a project to improve human resource management will greatly
contribute to achievement of the overall objective of BCM modernization. This is a very
important component that merits particular attention, since the gains made under the project will
be developed to greater advantage if the pertinent human resources are managed appropriately.
Project performance
FINDEP was a very unusual project both by its very nature and because of the many
changes that occurred during its lifetime.
If we measure performance in relation to management of the project resources, we arrive
at two differing evaluations. From the World Bank's point of view, FINDEP was classified as a
non-performing project during its early years. This assessment was not shared by the Central
Bank, since the World Bank's evaluation was based on the level of disbursements.
It is quite true that from that angle FINDEP was a poor performer, since after the
organizational structure to manage and run the project was set up, expenditures were "frozen"
until such time as the projects were better defined and approved by the authorities, their
objectives consistent with the overall objective, and their expenditures properly targeted. This
phase extended for some time beyond the period needed for the studies and analyses, prerequisite
to the commitment of resources.
FINDEP experienced difficulties of various kinds leading to considerable delays and
even causing postponement of the closing date. The problems included:
-     changes connected to staff movements at all levels, whether at the World Bank or at the
Central Bank, within the project team, or on the consultants' side; the necessary time-
consuming replacements and reassignments never failed to hold up progress;
-     delays in the decision making process;
-     in some cases, a lack of knowledge of the local situation because of the distance or lack
of agreement among the project actors delayed the issue of statements of non-objection;
-     the decision to have two development locations (Antananarivo and Brussels) was not a
smart one. It led to delays and problems of coordination between the development teams.
With respect to project financing, the budget was revised several times, in terms not of
amount but of allocation. Because of various changes, certain components were canceled and
their financing allocated to other components.
However, once the organizational structure to manage and run FINDEP was in place, the
budgets were followed to the letter and expenditures were made in line with requirements and
with study recommendations.

Completion and sustainability of the reforms
Banque Centrale de Madagascar (BCM) has been effectively strengthened, and thanks to
FINDEP it has reached the point of no return. The Central Bank has turned the corner towards
modermization, but there are still more steps to be taken.
On the one hand, the gains achieved must be sustained and upheld. On the other hand, a
new project will need to be undertaken to improve sectors not covered by FINDEP or to
consolidate actions already taken.
For the project outcomes to be sustained and upheld, it will be necessary to set up
competent and appropriate organizational structures. For example, a new organization is needed
to manage and develop the new system.
The sustainability of the reforms and continued development of the Central Bank are
dependent on the latter's human resource management system. Unfortunately, this is one of the
sectors where no sizeable project was undertaken. Knowing that the basic capital of any
enterprise is its staff, the BCM needs to undertake a human resources project to ensure effective
and efficient operation and obtain the full benefit of the recent changes brought about by
FINDEP.
Implementation of CSBF Component of FINDEP (Part B)
The objectives of FINDEP were well defined but were not all accomplished.
Equipment, vehicles and supplies
The project was to provide the CSBF with the necessary equipment for on- and off-site
supervision. Unfortunately, some of the equipment procured under the project turned out to be of very
average quality:
-     The BULL Zenith portable microcomputers (Intel 486, 25 Mhz) are obsolete and
unreliable (of the five purchased, only one is in perfect operating condition, while
the others all have functional defects of varying severity).
-     Some of the portable printers broke down after only two years of use.
-     One dot matrix printer, acquired for stencil work, cannot print on that type of
support, despite service calls by the supplier's technicians;
-     Two monitors broke down after hardly being used at all.
-     One of the photocopying machines has broken down several times, to the point
that it is now used only for minor jobs.
-     One of the cordless telephones broke down after a couple of weeks. It was sent
back to the supplier several times for repair, but is now completely unusable.
With respect to the computer equipment, it should be noted that CSBF was not free to choose, at
least for the first purchases . The selection (in terms of both technical features and supplier) was virtually
imposed upon it by the SEMA GROUP of consultants, which took no account of CSBF's real needs.
10



It turned out that the equipment offered by the supplier in question was not only expensive but of
poor quality, particularly the poitable computers and portable printers. This procurement procedure was
dictated by the Central Bank's group procurement method.
Technical assistance, training and studies
In the area of studies and on-site inspections the training aspect was successfully accomplished.
The technical assistant provided valuable support in setting up databases on the banks, the money market,
the interbank foreign exchange market, etc. Monthly memoranda have been regularly produced since
then. The CSBF will soon publish its second annual report.
Where on-site inspections were concerned, despite several theory sessions and the design of a
data analysis sheet for credit operations, the technical assistant was unable to complete the training of
General Secretariat staff. Thus, the objective of setting up two full-time inspection teams was not
accomplished.
Updating of regulatory provisions
In conjunction with the technical assistance, the work carried out on this component consisted of
revising and supplementing the existing regulatory framework to ensure convergence with international
practice while keeping the Malagasy context in full view.
The work performed resulted in an overhaul of the banking regulations and of Law No. 95 030 of
February 22, 1996 governing all credit institutions, and the definition of prudential and management
standards: available equity, risk coverage ratio, risk division ratio, rules on foreign exchange positions
(already revised within the Euro framework), rules on periodic and annual statements of accounts, rules
on provisioning for bad debts.
To finalize harmonization with the international Cooke ratio and to extend the field of application
of current legislative and regulatory provisions to the new categories of establishment covered (offshore
banks, mutualist institutions, specialized financial institutions), the following projects were prepared and
will be submitted to the CSBF for decision:
-      instruction concerning an accounting plan for credit institutions;
-      instruction concerning available equity of credit institutions;
-      instruction concerning solvency of credit institutions;
-      instruction concerning division of risks of credit institutions;
-      instruction concerning credit institution equity participations;
-      instruction concerning lending to shareholders or associates, managers, directors,
and auditors;
-      instruction concerning internal audits;
-      instruction concerning production and publication of the accounts of credit
institutions.
This part was satisfactorily performed by the technical assistant. However, a collegial effort
would have been more beneficial for the supervisory staff.
Other tasks assigned to the technical assistant
11



Within the framework of privatization of public banks, the technical assistant contributed actively
to the formulation of basic negotiating data for members of the Technical Monitoring Committee and the
Negotiators Group.
Borrower's performance
Equipment, vehicles and supplies
Procurement by the CSBF General Secretariat of the items under this heading considerably
expanded its capacity to supervise the banking system as a whole. Despite the staff shortage, the reports
of the establishments concemed were processed within an appropriate timeframe. The only delay arose in
preparation of the annual report, mainly because of the lack of available data on the former public banks.
In its capacity as Secretariat of the Monitoring Committee, the CSBF General Secretariat also
provided support within the framework of the Government's withdrawal from the two national banks
(BTM and BFV).
However, a number of constraints prevented full compliance with the annual work programs.
The most glaring instance of this was the failure to set up any mission outside of the capital region.
Training
It was above all in the area of training that the General Secretariat was unable to fully
avail itself of the funds placed at its disposal. Lacking a clear definition of needs and of a well-established
training program, the General Secretariat waited for proposals from the Central Bank's Human Resources
Department instead of taking the initiative to check out the possibilities offered by the various training
agencies, both foreign and local.
As a result, the General Secretariat participated only in the workshops organized jointly
by the World Bank and the French Banking Commission, even though other options would have been
available.
The balance of the funds for the CSBF training component was consequently reallocated to the Central
Bank.
Bank Performance
At the start, it was not easy to work with the World Bank (example: delayed issuance of
statements of non-objection).
But once changes were made and communications with the officials concerned started to
improve, the relationship developed satisfactorily.
