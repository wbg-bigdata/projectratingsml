CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS
(as of July 1, 1974)
Parity Rate
US$1           =  Rs 6.47
Rs 1           =  US$0.155
Rs 1 million   =  US$155,000
FEEC Rate
US$1           =  Rs 10.68
Rs 1           =  US$0.094
Rs 1 million   =  US$94,000
The Sri Lanka Rupee, which had been linked to the U.S.
Dollar from November 6, 1971, was re-linked to the Pound Sterling
from July 10, 1972 onward at a parity rate of f 1.00 = Rs 15.60.
Parity rates with all other currencies are determined from time
to time by the Central Bank.
The Central Bank of Ceylon makes foreign exchange avail-
able for certain categories of imports through sale of Foreign
Exchange Entitlement Certificates (FEECs) for which a premium is
charged. The same premium is offered to exporters on foreign
exchange earnings from the sale of non-traditional goods. The
net revenue from the sale of FEECs is credited to the Government's
Revenue Account.  The premium is presently fixed at 65% of the
Rupee parity rate and results in an exchange rate of Rs 10.68 =
US$1. This rate currently applies to about 20% of merchandise
exports, about 60% of merchandise imports and to most invisible
transactions with the exception of aid receipts.
The proceeds of the Credit will be lent to Government and
subsequently on-lent to DFCC clients at the rupee parity rate of
exchange, but clients must pay the Government the FEEC premium, where
applicable, for the goods imported under the Credit.

APPRAlSAL OF A THIRD
DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION OF CEYLON PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Covernment of Sri Lanka has asked for an IDA Credit to assist
in financing private industry, through the Development Finance Company of
Ceylon (DPCC). This report recommends a $4.5 million Credit, which would
be used mainly to meet the foreign exchange requirements of export-oriented
industries and tourism projects that have high Government priority because
of their foreign exchange earning potential.
ii.       The severe strains in Sri Lanka's economy have resulted in a
stagnant per capita GDP in real terms, while the balance of payments has
deteriorated because of increased oil, fertilizer and food prices. Ex-
ports are mainly tea, rubber and coconut, and little attention has been
given to diversifying them until recently, when Government introduced
various incentive schemes to promote non-traditional exports. Sri Lanka
has enjoyed advanced welfare policies, notably free or low-cost food for
low-income groups. Since 1973, Government has taken various measures to
reduce food subsidies and encourage domestic production, but despite these,
the fiscal burden of subsidies remains high, because of rising commodity
prices.
iii.      The industrial sector accounts for about 13% of GDP and 11% of
employmenit. Production and investment have been low for some years, since
industries rely heavily on imported raw materials and capital equipment,
and these have been restricted because of the severe shortage of foreign
exchange. Investment in the private sector has been depressed because of
the foreign exchange shortage and uncertainty as to the future of the
sector.
iv.       There has in recent years been some improvement, particularly
the introduction of an elaborate system of incentives designed to promote
industrial exports. Exporters receive a premium above the official ex-
change rate for export sales, and can retain 5% of export sales proceeds
in foreign exchange and can use it for any purpose. Also profits from
export sales are exempt from income tax, and shareholders in export firms
receive tax concessions on their investment. As a result, export of in-
dustrial goods (mainly garments, leather goods, and vegetable oil products)
have increased almost fourfold over the past 3 years, though from a very
small base. These incentives have stimulated private investors. However,
the severe shortage of foreign exchange overall has prevented full benefits
to industry from these incentives.
v.        Investment has been quite active in tourism.  Hotel accommoda-
tion has increased to 2,660 rooms in 1974, while a further 2,700 are
under construction or planned. This reflects the rapid growth in tourist
arrivals, which have more than doubled over the past 3 years. The sector
enjoys various fiscal incentives including tax holidays and concessions.



ii -
Despite the world decline in tourism, a recent IBRD mission that reviewed
Sri Lanka's tourism sector estimated that tourist arrivals should increase
by 45% over the next 3 years, reaching about 122,000 in 1977. At this
traffic level, the projected capacity of 4,800 rooms in that year could
operate with reasonable profitability. To achieve sound long-term devel-
opment, the Ceylon Tourist Board requires strengthening. It was aRreed
during negotiations that the Board would employ a tourism advisor by the
end of the 1975 to assist mainly in setting up hotel construction and
operating codes, in hotel classification and in planning and implementation
of tourism development programs.
vi.       DFCC was established in 1955 with Bank Group assistance.  Three-
fourths of its shares are owned by private individuals and institutions,
the rest by Government and its agencies. It is the only institution spe-
cializing in long term finance for the private industrial sector. It has
financed mostly manufacturing ventures, but has recently increased its
lending for tourism projects. DFCC's operations since 1970 have fluctuated
widely, reflecting the changes in the climate for private investment. Its
commitment in loans and investments declined from Rs 21 million in FY70 to
less than Rs 1 million in FY72, and rose to an annual average of Rs 18 mil-
lion in FY73 and FY74. The sharp increase since FY72 is mainly due to tour-
ism, with some improvement in export-oriented industries.
vii.      As of September 30, 1974, DFCC financed some 177 projects involv-
ing 107 companies, to a total of Rs 152 million (US$23 million). About a
half went to food processing, chemicals, textiles and tourism projects. The
rest was reasonably well diversified among other industries. The share of
hotel projects is expected to continue rising in the next two years but
DFCC intends to set a maximum hotel exposure limit of 45% of its total
portfolio.
viii.     DFCC's loans and investments are of a medium and relatively
small size as have been the recipients of its lending. As at September 30,
1974, 60% of DFCC's operations represented individual loans and investments
of less than Rs 0.5 million (US$77,000) and 82% were for individual loans
and investments of less than Rs 1 million (US$155,000). DFCC's Act and
Policy Statement were amended in 1974 to enable it to extend assistance
to proprietorships, partnerships, and cooperatives, in addition to limited
liability companies, and its minimum loan size was reduced from Rs 100,000
to Rs 75,000 (from US$15,000 to US$11,600) - which may be reduced further
still - to enable it finance smaller enterprises. There is no official
definition of small scale enterprise in Sri Lanka, but these have sometimes
been defined in terms of enterprises whose fixed assets do not exceed Rs 200,000
(US$31,000). DFCC intends to start limited financing of small scale units
of this size in the next two years, and a portion of the Credit (US$200,000)
has been spefically allocated for lending for this purpose. DFCC intends
to move slowly into this type of financing in view of its small staff and
its limited experience in this field which requires close supervision and con-
centrated provision of ancillary services. It will collaborate with the
Industrial Development Board (a statutory body under the Ministry of Industries)



- iii -
which undertakes feasibility studies of small industrial projects and provides
technical services to such projects.
ix.       Lack of projects resulting from uncertainty in the private invest-
ment climate in the country has constrained the development impact of DFCC.
DFCC's efforts have focused on financially attractive projects with the
intention of building a strong portfolio and maintaining a sound financial
position. DFCC management is now conscious of the need to make additional
efforts to identify and promote projects and to assist in the formulation
of industrial policies. Recently, Government has recognized a definite role
for the private sector in export-oriented industries and tourism where there
is scope for DFCC to play a more active developmental role. DFCC development
strategy in the next two to three years is to focus its financing on export
oriented industries and tourism and to start a limited association with
small scale sector units. It will finance import substitution projects,
but in these it intends to give preference to projeccts in industries with
relatively high level of capacity utilization and to balancing, modernization
and replacement projects. It may also finance one or two projects directed
to the cultivation and processing of non-traditional agriculture. DFCC
also intends to play a promotional role in helping in the regional distri-
bution of industry, in identifying, improving, and screening project and policy
ideas emanating from the private sector and in advising the Government on these
ideas. DFCC should thus become a useful and effective channel of communica-
tion between the private sector and the Government.
x.        DFCC is well managed; and despite an increasing Government role in
managing the economy, it has preserved its operational autonomy. A new
Chairman has taken over DFCC's leadership and a second Government director
has been added to DFCC's Board, which should improve contacts between DFCC
and the Ministry of Industries and Scientific Affairs. The present 12 pro-
fesional staff are competent. DFCC intends to further strengthen its staff
by recruiting a market analyst and a junior execution during the current year.
It will also strengthen its capacity for appraisal and supervision of hotel
projects. It was agreed during negotiations that DFCC will, by the end of
1975, either recruit a qualified hotel projects specialist or make suitable
arrangements for the training of one of its staff in this field. Up to
US$15,000 of the IDA Credit proceeds could be used for training abroad for
this purpose.
xi.       DFCC's project appraisals are adequate to assess financial
viability, technical aspects, market prospects and management capability,
but its economic analysis requires improvement. An undertstanding was
reached with DFCC that it will look more thoroughly into the economic impact
of its projects and in particular calculate the economic rate of return for
all projects costing Rs 1 million or more and the domestic resource cost per
unit of foreign exchange earned/saved for projects costing between Rs 0.5
and up to Rs 1.0 million. DFCC has three senior staff who have been trained
at the EDI and who are capable of making such evaluations. DFCC also intends
to pay particular attention in its future appraisals to the level of capacity
utilization in industries it assists to ensure that its financing does not
create additional excess capacity.



xli.      DFCC's current annual lending rates for both rupee and foreign
currerncy loans is 10.5%Apa. The rupee rate is in line with those of other
financial institutions in Sri Lanka, but Government is aware that interest
rates are generally low in the country and the Central Bank is currently
reviewing their structure. DFCC rates for local currency loans might be
adjusted upward in the light of the review. Given the scarcity of foreign
exchange, there is need to encourage a more economic use of foreign currency
resources. It was therefore agreed that DFCC's foreign currency lending rate
under the proposed Credit would be increased to 12% pa. However, it was
also agreed that DFCC would lend to enterprises whose fixed assets do not
exceed Rs 200,000 (US$31,000) at a special rate of 10%pa which is in line
with Government's policy to encourage the small scale sector. A small portion
of Credit will be used to finance such enterprises and the weighted spread
to DFCC on the proceeds of the Credit would be about 3.4%; the spread on
DFCC's overall debt resources (including the interest-free Government loan)
would be 4.2% in FY79. The Government would continue to assume the exchange
risk. Passing on the risk to the final client at this juncture would create
additional element of uncertainty in the present private investment climate.
xiii.     DFCC has depended on IBRD for its foreign currency resources
(total US$5.2 million), and on Government, the Central Bank and commercial
banks for its rupee funds. Since 1966 it has increased its rupee borrowings
from commercial banks, but has been unsuccessful in diversifying its
sources of foreign exchange. Because of a sharp rise in rupee lending in
the past two years, DFCC faced a rupee resource constraint, but in October
1974 it obtained an overdraft facility for up to Rs 6.5 million from the
Bank of Ceylon which is being converted into a long term credit. DFCC
intends to continue making efforts to tap new sources of funds.
xiv.      Despite the decline in portfolio over the past several years,
DFCC has been able to maintain a reasonable level of profitability by mainly
reducing its administrative expenses. Net profits amounted to 8.4% of
average net worth in the past two years and 12.2% of year-end share capital.
It has paid dividends at 8% since FY68. DFCC's long-term debt/equity ratio,
as defined in the last IBRD loan agreement, varied between 2.1 and 2.8 over
the past five years against a contractual limit of 3.0. The new agreement
sets a new long-term debt/equity ratio of 7.0 based on a new definition. 1/
The quality of DFCC's portfolio is good. It had four companies in arrears
of Rs 490,000 at the end of September 1974 while it had provisions against
bad debts of Rs 1.4 million. Only one of the nine companies in which DFCC
has investment was operating at a loss but DFCC has ample provisions against
bad investment (Rs 650,000) to more than cover a possible loss of Rs 50,000.
1/   In the last IBRD agreement, the portion of the Government subordinated
loan which falls due after the last maturity of the IBRD loan is ex-
cluded from debt and included in equity. The present agreement bases
the ratio on total debt and equity. Using the new definition, debt/
equity ratio during the past five years varied between 4.2 and 5.3.

xv.       DFCC expects to commit Rs 45 million over the two years through
March, 1977: Rs 29 million (US$4.5 million) in foreign currency and Rs 16
million in rupees. By January 1975 DFCC had identified 54 projects with
foreign exchange requirements of about US$7 million (approximately 30%
export-oriented, 40% tourism and 30% import substitution projects). How-
ever, because some projects are tentative and others may drop out, it is
more likely DFCC will be able to commit about US$4.5 million in foreign
exchange in the next two years. DFCC's present foreign exchange resources
have all been committed and the IDA Credit is expected to cover its needs
through March 1977.
xvi.      The Credit would be used to cover the direct CIF cost of capital
goods imported for projects financed by DFCC, and also to cover 65% of the
cost of imported goods bought "off the shelf" in Sri Lanka for tourism
projects, representing the estimated uverage foreign exchange component of
these goods. US$200,000 of the Credit would be specifically allocated for
lending to small enterprises whose fixed assets do not exceed Rs 200,000,
and upto US$15,000 would be made available for short term training abroad
of DFCC staff member in hotel project appraisal and supervision.
xvii.     The Government would lend the proceeds of the Credit to DFCC at
an interest of 8.5% pa. Repayments to Government would be made within 15
years including grace period, on a flexible amortization schedule in appro-
ximate conformity with repayments received by DFCC from sub-borrowers. It
was agreed that DFCC would submit to IDA for prior approval projects using
US$150,000 or more of the proposed Credit. Requirement of IDA approval
of a part of DFCC's projects is still desirable to maintain a dialogue on
project appraisal.






APPRAISAL OF A THIRD
DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION OF CEYLON PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Sri Lanka has requested an IDA Credit for the
Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) to finance private invest-
ment in the industrial and tourism sectors. An IDA Credit of $4.5 million
is recommended.
1.02      The Bank has made two loans to DFCC totalling $12 million.  The
first of $4 million was approved in 1967, and the second of $8 million in
1969. In 1970, the sudden deterioration in the investment climate in the
private sector caused a sharp decline in DFCC's business in the subsequent
two years and forced it to cancel $6.8 million of these loans leaving $5.2
million to be disbursed. Its lending has picked up significantly over the
past two years, and this balance was fully committed by end-1973. The re-
covery was due mainly to reactivated investments in export-oriented indus-
tries and tourism projects which, because of their foreign exchange earning
potential, now benefit from various Government incentives.
1.03      Prospects for private industrial investments are still somewhat
uncertain. There is a severe shortage of foreign exchange which makes it
difficult for investors to import the necessary raw materials as well as
capital equipment. It is vital, therefore, that Sri Lanka develop industries
with high foreign exchange earning capacity. This Credit is intended
principally to help promote such industries.
II. ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND INDUSTRIAL FINANCE
General
2.01      A detailed review of Sri Lanka's economic situation is contained
in the latest Bank economic report "Recent Economic Developments and Current
Prospects for Sri Lanka", dated February 20, 1975 (No. 622a-CE).
2.02      Sri Lanka's economy is largely dependent upon the services and
agricultural sectors, which contribute about 46% and 33% to GDP respectively,
while the industrial sector contributes about 16%. Although the standard of
living for much of Sri Lanka's population is considerably above that of the
poorest Asian countries, and a minimum basic diet is supplied to all through
the subsidized food ration, average annual per capita income is low (around
$100). The economy is currently undergoing severe strains. There has been
little expansion in commodity output in recent years. Between 1969-70 and
1972-73 GDP increased at an annual rate of about 2.3% in real terms a gross
income at a considerably lower rate because of a sharp decline in the terms
of trade. With population growing at a 2.2% a year, there has been no im-
provement in the standard of living of the average Sri Lankan in the past
few years. A most serious problem is the balance of payments situation.



Jwing to the sharp increase in prices of imported goods, the estimated
1974 current account deficit was $240 million, against $39 million in 1973.
Basically, the current predicament is a product of both the rising prices
of major imports and the large food subsidy program. Social welfare policies
pursued since independence have, among other things, resulted in continued
food subsidization, which in turn discouraged domestic food production and
perpetuated a heavy dependence on food imports. Despite the chronic deter-
ioration in the countryts terms of trade, little attention was paid to re-
structuring its export sector,    ich depends heavily on three major crops
(tea, rubber and coconuts), which account for 80% of total exports.l/
2.03      Recently Government has launched a variety of incentive schemes
to promote the export of non-traditional goods. As a result, industrial
exports have grown significantly over the past three years, though from a
very small base. Since late 1973, Government has implemented a number of
measures to abolish or reduce subsidies on food and other mass consumption
goods and services. Although the continued escalation of imported food,
fertilizer and oil prices has on balance prevented a reduction of the fiscal
burden of subsidies, Government should be given credit for initiating these
necessary but politically unpopular measures.
Industrial Sector
2.04      Characteristics.  The industrial sector accounts for about 13% of
GDP and employs about 410,000, or 11% of total employment. Industry consists
mainly of consumer goods production. In 1973, food processing represented
50% of total industrial value added and textiles 14%, compared with 11% for
capital goods. Some 2,500 relatively large-sized and well-organized firms
contribute an estimated 70%O of industrial value-added and 30% of industrial
employment. Included in this group are 26 state-owned enterprises which
account for some 23% of value-added and 6% of employment in the industrial
sector. The rest of the sector consists of a vast number of small, mostly
non-corporate units 2/, largely in handloom and powerloom operations and
other cottage-type industries such as coir products, potteries and carpen-
tries.
2.05      Overall, Sri Lanka's industry depends heavily on imported raw
materials. During 1973, two-thirds by value of industrial raw materials
were impprted. Geographical distribution of industries is extremely
uneven: about 90% of manufacturing output is concentrated in the Colombo
area.  Government is establishing a number of industrial estates in various
parts of the country to help dispersal outside Colombo.
2.06      Recent Performance and Problems.  Industrial activity has been
virtually stagnant for the past several years. Value added from manufac-
turing (at 1963 factor prices) grew at an annual average rate of 1.0%
1/   IBRD, Republic of Sri Lanka: Agricultural Policy and Program Review; repor
report no. 579a-CE dated February 19, 1975.
2/   Estimates of the number of such units vary from 25,000 to 100,000.



-3 -
between 1971 and 1973 compared to 9% in the latter half of the 1960's. With
few exceptions, industries requiring larger proportions of raw material im-
ports experienced slower growth. This confirms that the principal constraint
on industrial growth has been the severe shortage of foreign exchange for the
import of raw materials. This shortage, coupled with management deficiencies,
labor disputes and unbalanced facilities, have forced many units to operate
at below capacity; often at 50% or less.
2.07      Industrial investment in general has been inactive.  While offi-
cial statistics indicate that investment in plant and machinery at current
prices increased by 32% between 1971 and 1973, there was probably no growth
in real terms because of price increases. 1/   Here again, the major factor
contributing to the slow investment growth has been the foreign exchange
shortage, which has not only made importation of capital equipment difficult,
but also deterred new projects because of dim prospects of obtaining neces-
sary imported raw materials and spare parts. In addition, private sector in-
vestment has been hindered by uncertainties about its future role (Annex 1).
2.08      Against this background, however, the export of industrial goods
more than tripled between 1971 and 1973 (reaching $15 million), and in the
first nine months of 1974 was 26% above the level in the corresponding
period of 1973. Among items which showed particularly high growth were
garments and fabrics, leather goods, vegetable oil products, rubber products
(footwear, tires, etc.), processed sea food and some engineering goods. This
improved export performance was recorded mainly by products with a relatively
low import content (40% or less), except for garments (70-80%). Overall,
private-sector firms have achieved a higher rate of growth in industrial
exports than public enterprises, their share rising from 45% in 1971 to 50%
in 1973.
2.09      This remarkable improvement in industrial exports reflects Govern-
ment's recent vigorous efforts to promote non-traditional exports through
various tax and other incentives to manufacturers of these products (para
2.12). These incentives have induced many existing manufacturers to switch
from production for the domestic market to that for export. Government
licenses for leather, wood and rubber goods projects soared from five in
1972 to 44 in 1973. However, implementation of many of them has been de-
layed or stalled for lack of access to foreign exchange to import plant and
machinery. The foreign exchange shortage has also prevented existing firms
from modernizing and balancing their machinery, which in many cases is obso-
lete and unsuitable for producing goods of exportable quality.
1/   The Colombo Consumers' Price Index, which is the only official indi-
cator of price trends in Sri Lanka, rose by 6.3% during 1972 and 9.7%
during 1973; however, this index is generally considered to understate
substantially the real price increase because of its inadequacy of
coverages and obsolescence of weight allocation.



-4-
Industrial Policy
2.10      Strategies.  Government laid down new industrial development pol-
icies in 1971 which placed primary emphasis on: (i) reorienting industrial
activity towards exports; (ii) promoting labor-intensive projects mainly in
the small-scale sector and rural areas; and (iii) minimizing the foreign
exchange requirements for capital goods and raw materials. 1/ Also, Gov-
ernment proposes to lessen the concentration of wealth and income in a few
priviledged groups, and to this end, has assigned a leading role to public
sector enterprises and to strengthening social control over the private sector.
2.11      Achievement of these goals, amounting to a fundamental restructur-
ing of industry, would require comprehensive and coordinated policy formula-
tion and well-calculated incentive systems. Government has been preoccupied
with more urgent problems of balance of payments and budgetary deficits, and
has not yet spelt out detailed and-coherent programs to implement the pro-
nounced objectives, except for export promotion. Also there has been no
systematic approach, particularly in the demarcation of the roles of the
public and private sectors and the promotion of small industries (Annex 1).
2.12      Promotion of Industrial Exports.  Government has in recent years
intensified its efforts to stimulate export of non-traditional products
(other than tea, rubber and coconuts) and these have met with reasonable
success (para 2.08). The current package of incentives consists mainly of:
(a) Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate (FEEC): Exporters
of non-traditional goods receive a premium above the official
exchange rate. The premium was increased in November 1972
to 65% from the previous 55%. Since the FEEC rate also
applies to most merchandise imports, exports with a lower
import content can obtain larger benefits from this scheme.
(b) Convertible Rupee Account: Introduced in January 1973, it
allows exporters to retain a proportion (originally 2%,
increased to 3% in November 1973 and 5% in November 1974) 2/
of the F.O.B. value of their exports, inclusive of FEECs,
for the importation of any goods except those which may
compete adversely with locally manufactured articles.
(c)  Tax Holidays and Investment Relief:  Effective April 1972,
profits from export sales are exempt from income tax for
8 years (new companies) and 5 years (existing companies).
Dividends declared during the tax holiday are also exempt
1/   "Ceylon's Industrial Policy" (July 1971) and "The Five-Year Plan
1972-76" (November 1971).

from tax to the extent they relate to the profits from
export (new companies only). Investors in exporting
enterprises are also granted investment relief whereby
the actual amount of investment in ordinary shares or
one-fifth of taxable income, whichever is lower, can
be deducted from income for taxation purposes.
(d)  Other Incentives.  Manufacturers of industrial goods for
export receive custom duty rebates on their imported
inputs. Export sales are exempt from the compulsory
savings and income ceiling scheme and from business
turnover tax. Export enterprises can also benefit from
a lump-sum depreciation allowance (50-80% for machinery),
development rebate (20-40%) and carry-forward of losses. 1/
2.13      To complement these efforts, Government has since mid-1972 encour-
aged joint ventures with private foreign enterprises, in which local part-
ners (whether public or private) hold majority ownership and retain effec-
tive control. In exchange, Government gives assurances that full compensation
for the investment will be made in the event of nationalization, and that re-
mittances of profits and repatriation of capital will be allowed. During the
two years up to June 1974, 20 joint ventures, mostly export-oriented, involv-
ing foreign investment of about $3 million were approved.
2.14      Export incentives have contributed significantly to the recent
increase in industrial exports, but exporters have sometimes been constrained
by shortage of foreign exchange for raw material imports. The Government is
now according highest priority to export industries in the allocation of
foreign exchange for raw material imports.
Tourism Sector
2.15      A Bank mission visited Sri Lanka in November/December 1974 to re-
view the tourism sector. The mission's report, from which the findings
below are derived, has been submitted to Government.
2.16      Recent Performance and Characteristics.  Sri Lanka's tourism sector
has achieved a rapid growth since the mid-1960's. Though starting from a
very small base, tourist arrivals increased from 19,000 in 1966 to 77,900 in
1/   The 1975 budget contains proposals to withdraw some of the fiscal in-
centives, which were considered overly liberal.  They mainly include
limiting tax holidays and investment relief to broad-based (yet to be
defined) companies, and abolishing both development rebates for plant,
machinery and fixtures, and lump-sum depreciation. The rebate of 40%
in respect of industrial buildings which includes hotels will not be
affected. It is difficult to assess at this stage the impact of these
measures, still under discussion in Parliament, on future private in-
vestment. However, it is unlikely that the projected levels of DFCC
lending in the next few years would be significantly affected if these
measures are enacted.



1973, an average annual growth of 22.4%. This compares with the average
increase of 12.8% for the South Asia region and 7.4% for the world over the
same period. While the growth rate in 1974 has somewhat declined to an
estimated 9% (85,000 arrivals) mainly because of the world-wide economic
recession, this must still be regarded as a satisfactory performance when
compared with the zero growth for world travel as a whole. Official foreign
exchange receipts from tourists (net of FEECs) rose from $7.3 million in 1972
to $12.8 million in 1973 and further to an estimated $15.1 million in 1974.
2.17      The major source of tourist traffic is Western Europe (particularly
Germany, France, Scandinavia) which in the past two years accounted for
about 65% of all arrivals. Travel from this area has been heavily promoted
on the basis of group inclusive tours. About 90% of total traffic from
this source travelled either on charter aircraft or in groups on scheduled
air services.
2.18      The tourism sector is one of few areas where private investment
has been quite active. Hotel accommodation, which is predominantly provided
by the private sector, has increased from 770 rooms in 1967 to 1,891 in
1972 and 2,661 (59 hotels) at end-1974. About 30% of these rooms are in
Colombo, 44% on the beaches and 26% on the interior circuit (consisting of
the ancient cities, Kandy and the hill country). Sri Lanka's tourism is
characterized by high seasonality with tourist arrivals heavily concentrated
from November to March. Consequently, the average annual room occupancy has
been relatively low - 42.4% in 1973 and 42.8% in 1974.  Fortunately, however,
average break-even occupancies in Sri Lanka hotels are also low by inter-
national comparison and typically range around 40% for many of the small
resort hotels which account for the bulk of tourist accommodation. The low
break-even point derives mainly from relatively low investment and operating
costs. As a result, the profitability of hotel operations has been quite
attractive with gross operating profits often reaching 30% of total revenues,
which themselves are high in relation to investment.
2.19      Incentives for Tourism Promotion.  The active hotel investment has
also been induced by an extensive system of Government incentives which are
fairly similar to those for export-oriented industries. These include 1/:
(a)  Tax Holidays:  Hotels are granted a 5-year full tax
holiday and thereafter, if operated by limited companies,
an additional 15-year partial (50%) exemption from income
tax. Dividends declared during the full year holiday
are also exempt from tax.
(b) Investment Relief: Companies holding shares in hotels
are entitled to investment relief up to a maximum of 50%
of their investment. Individual investors benefit from
full relief and also from exemption from wealth tax for
five years.



- 7 -
(c) Other Incentives: As with exporters of non-traditional
goods, hotel projects are entitled to Convertible Rupee
Accounts (5%), accelerated depreciation allowance, develop-
ment rebate, carrying-forward of losses, and custom duty
concessions.
2.20      Prospects.  In 1967, Government's 10-year tourism development
plan projected tourist arrivals in 1976 at 307,000, subsequently revised
downward to 220,000. However, as a result of the change in the world
travel outlook following the sharp rise in oil prices since October 1973
and the subsequent doubts about world economic prospects, Government again
revised its projections in mid-1974, and estimated arrivals in 1977 at
206,500. The recent Bank sector mission suggested a more realistic arriv-
als target of 122,000 in 1977 which would represent a 45% increase during
1975-77, compared with a 114% actual growth over the past three years.
2.21      Currently 52 hotel projects with a combined capacity of 2,691
rooms have been approved by Government and are in various stages of imple-
mentation. If all of these are completed on schedule, Sri Lanka's total
hotel capacity would expand to 5,352 rooms by the end of 1976. However,
since Government expects to withdraw from graded classification 559 exist-
ing hotel rooms by 1977, 4,793 rooms would be effectively available to the
international travel trade in that year. Based on the historical data on
room density (1.7 persons per room) and average length of stay (10.3 nights),
and given the expected traffic level of 122,000, these hotels would operate
at a 45% average occupancy in 1977, which is above the break-even point of
average-sized hotels in Sri Lanka. Although acceptable for a first full
year of operation, the 45% occupancy is substantially below the highest
possible level (55%). Thus, the projected hotel capacity of 4,793 rooms
in 1977 should not be exceeded, given present market expectations. The
Government intends to keep the demand situation under review to avoid creating
excess hotel capacity.                        f
2.22      Problems.  While the overall prospects for the sector appear rea-
sonably good, planning and implementation need considerable improvement for
sound long-term development. The standard of many of the lower-grade hotels
is barely acceptable for the international trade, particularly finish, in-
terior design and equipment. Many of the existing hotels and new projects
are too small to accommodate the package groups, the most dynamic element
in traffic growth. Operating standards are also deficient. It is therefore
important that the capabilities of the Ceylon Tourist Board, the Government
agency responsible for tourism planning and development, be strengthened to
provide the necessary services. The Government has agreed that a tourism
advisor will be employed by the Tourist Board by December 31, 1975. The
1/   Government has proposed to withdraw some of these fiscal incentives
(para 2.12, footnote). However, if implemented their impact on hotel
investment in the immediate future is expected to be relatively small.

advisor would assist in developing a hotel code for both physical and oper-
ating standards; appraising new hotel projects to ensure that they conform
to the hotel code and development plan; inspecting hotels in operation
regularly to ensure the maintenance of operating standards and service in
conformity with the hotel code; and in overall tourism development planning.
The Government expects to obtain UNDP financing for the services of this
advisor.
Industrial Finance
2.23      Financial Institutions.  Institutions have played a minor role
in financing industry in Sri Lanka. In 1967, only 9% of private invest-
ment in the manufacturing sector (including inventories) was financed by
institutions, whereas 53% came from firms' own funds and 38% from trade
credits and other non-institutional sources. While statistics for more
recent years are not available, there are no indications that this financing
pattern has changed significantly. Amongst financial institutions, 11
commercial banks (four domestic; seven foreign) provide the bulk of funds;
their aggregate outstanding lending to the industrial sector (both public
and private) stood at Rs 517 million at end-1973, of which more than three-
fourths were lent by two Government-owned banks (Bank of Ceylon and People's
Bank). The commercial banks, however, have no access to foreign exchange
resources. Also, their loans are predominantly short-term: almost two-
thirds by amount outstanding at end-1973 had maturities of less than one
year and only 11% (Rs 58 million) of more than five years. For all prac-
tical purposes, DFCC is the only long-term credit institution providing
capital for private industry. Although the Government-owned Agricultural
and Industrial Credit Corporation (AICC) can finance industry, its indus-
trial lending has been marginal. Since 1955 it has made new loans only to
the extent of its loan collections and annual profits because of lack of
new resources.1/ DFCC's portfolio (Rs 57 million in March 1974 excluding
tourism finance), which consists predominantly of loans over five years and
equity investments, roughly matches the aggregate balance of total commercial
bank industrial loans with maturities over five years.
2.24      Commercial banks' industrial lending is generally conservative;
their lending decisions mainly based on the adequacy of the borrowers'
security. DFCC is the only institution whose lending criteria are pri-
marily concerned with project viability and which has sufficient expertise
to perform project appraisals. DFCC has in the past provided modest con-
sultancy services to commercial banks for financing large and complex proj-
ects.
2.25      Government intends to establish a National Development Bank (NDB)
to provide long-term capital mainly to industrial, but also to agricultural
1/  AICC was established in 1943 mainly to extend loans for agriculture
and construction. Lack of funds and rigid security requirements
have been the main reasons for its poor performance. Government is
currently planning to merge AICC with the State Mortgage Bank which
provides housing and agricultural loans.



and commercial, enterprises in the public sector. NDB would relieve Govern-
ment of its budgetary support to these enterprises and instill more finan-
cial discipline in them. The Government envisages that NDB will specialize
in financing public sector enterprises, while DFCC would continue financing
private sector companies. Given the increasing importance of the public
sector, the proposed NDB could be a vital mechanism for promoting industrial
development, and Bank Group assistance to it might be possible at some future
date. Government, the Central Bank and commercial banks are expected to
provide the bulk of NDB's equity capital.
2.26      Interest Rate Structure.  Interest rates charged/paid by financial
institutions in Sri Lanka are shown in Annex 2. They have been somewhat low.
While the commercial banks' current lending rates range from 6.5% to 12.0%
pa., about two-thirds by value of their outstanding loans carry rates of
7.0% to 9.0% pa. Specific rates are decided mainly on the security
offered and the bank's relationship with the client, rather than on the
duration of the loan. Rates on commercial banks' fixed deposits (3 months
to 4 years) are between 4.5% and 5.75% pa., while the Government Treasury
Bills (3 months) offer 5% pa. and Government Bonds (10-12 years) 9.0% pa.
Because of the limited role of institutional finance in private investment,
Government has played down the influence of interest rates on resource
allocation. However, it is now aware that the low rates, particularly on
commercial bank deposits, have hampered mobilization of private resources,
especially through the commercial banking system. Government saving insti-
tutions 1/ have been paying higher rates than commercial banks. In April
1972, these instutions were consolidated into the National Savings Bank,
(NSB) which has paid 7.5% pa. on one year fixed deposits and 11% pa. on
savings certificates (10 years). This has helped in generating new savings
but has also diverted considerable deposits from commercial banks which
are under pressure to increase their fixed deposit rates to compete with
NSB. If these rates were increased they will probably be associated with
an increase in their lending rates also. The Central Bank is currently
reviewing the interest rate structure.
2.27      Capital Market.  The strong inclination among private entrepreneurs
for self-financing, and the adverse climate for private investment have
stunted the development of Sri Lanka's capital market.  In the absence of a
proper stock exchange, the Colombo Brokers' Association (four members) has
functioned as an intermediary for a narrow and sluggish stock market.  While
the shares of some 150 companies are quoted, the bulk (92 companies) cover
tea and rubber business. Only 29 industrial companies are quoted. There
is a traditional preference in Sri Lanka to keep company ownership closely
held, and at present many companies are reluctant to have their shares quoted
in the stock exchange because of instability in the market resulting from the
economic uncertainties. To broaden equity ownership the Minister of Finance
has proposed in his recent FY75 Budget Speech to limit the granting of in-
vestment relief (in the various sectors) and tax holidays for non-traditional
1/   The Post Office Savings Bank, the Ceylon Savings Bank and the Savings
Certificate Fund.

exports, to broad-based companies (para 2.12, footnote). There have been
very few bond issues by private sector companies, partly because commercial
banks provide short and medium term loans subject to rollover at lower rates
than those that need be offered (at least 9% pa.) to compete with Government
bonds, and partly because Government and Government-owned institutions are
large borrowers of long term funds and pre-empt a substantial proportion of
these funds.
III. DFCC AS AN INSTITUTION
Introduction
3.01      The Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) was estab-
lished in 1955 by an Act of Parliament with advice and technical assis-
tance from IBRD, 1/ to finance private enterprises 2/ in industry, agri-
culture and commerce, including hotels, transportation, construction and
engineering. The Act confined financing to "limited liability companies,"
but an amendment in April 1974 enabled DFCC to assist proprietorships,
partnerships and cooperatives also.
Ownership and Organization
3.02      Shareholding.  A list of DFCC shareholders as of September 30,
1974 is shown in Annex 3. DFCC's authorized share capital is Rs 24 mil-
lion, of which Rs 8 million is subscribed and paid-in; it has remained
unchanged since 1966 when it was increased from Rs 7.1 million. About
46% of DFCC's shares are held by 289 private Ceylonese investors, 29% by
26 foreign investors (mostly banks) and 25% by three Government-owned
institutions. Originally the entire share capital was privately held.
Public shareholding came through the nationalization in 1961 of the Bank
of Ceylon which currently holds 19.5% of total shares. The other public
shareholders are the Insurance Corporation of Ceylon (5.3%) and the People's
Bank (0.2%). There has been no significant change in DFCC's ownership over
the past several years. With 318 shareholders (of whom 292 are Ceylonese)
DFCC's ownership is fairly broad-based by Sri Lanka standards.
3.03      Board of Directors.  A list of the members of DFCC's Board as
of September 30, 1974 is given in Annex 4. The Board has ten members
consisting of six shareholder-elected (including the Chairman), two
Government-appointed and two ex-officio (including the General Manager).
1/   DFCC was established mainly in response to a recommendation of an IBRD
economic survey mission report published in 1952. IBRD assisted in
drafting the DFCC Act.
2/   Defined in the Act to include enterprises in which Government owner-
ship does not exceed 20%.



- 11 -
The April 1974 amendment to the DFCC Act added a second Government direc-
tor 1/ and also made the Chairman's appointment subject to confirmation
by the Minister of Planning and Economic Affairs. After the former Chair-
man, Mr. N.E. Weerasooria passed away last MIay, Mr. W. Tennekoon was elected
in August 1974 under the new appointment procedure. Mr. Tennekoon, formerly
Governor of the Central Bank, an alternate Executive Director of IBRD (1955),
and an Executive Director of the Asian Development Bank, is well respected
in Government and business circles. The shareholder elected directors in-
clude three banking executives, a retired Auditor General (and former General
Manager of DFCC) and a retired civil servant. The Board usually meets once
a month and considers, amongst other things, all loan and investment pro-
posals. The Board has guided DFCC's operations in a sound but conservative
manner. The new chairman and the increased Government representation on
the Board are expected to bring about a more dynamic attitude.
3.04      Management.  Mr. S. Kanagaratnam has been DFCC's General Manager
since August 1972, when he was promoted from Assistant General Manager, for
a three-year term. Mr. Kanagaratnam joined DFCC in 1956 and has consider-
able background in development banking. Although constrained by the uncer-
tainty in Government policies towards the private sector, he should be
credited with reviving DFCC's business during the past two years through an
active involvement in tourism financing, a relatively new field for DFCC.
3.05      Staff.  DFCC has 12 professional and 26 non-professional staff
(Annex 5). Between FY68 and FY71, DFCC increased its professional staff
from 8 to 20 in anticipation of a substantial increase in business, but the
actual volume of operations in the following three years fell far short of
expectations owing to a sudden deterioration in the private investment
climate. As a result, 8 professionals left DFCC. Fortunately, however,
DFCC retained most of the senior staff. The existing staff is generally
well-qualified and adequate for the current level of operations. However,
in expectation of an increase in business following the availability of this
IDA Credit, the management plans to recruit a market analyst and a junior
professional and to strengthen its expertise in appraisal and supervision of
hotel projects.
3.06      DFCC's staff comprises personnel of various disciplines including
a lawyeK, professional accountants and engineers. The increasing importance
of hotel projects in DFCC's operations, makes the strengthening of hotel
projects' expertise particularly important. It was therefore agreed that
DFCC will by December 31, 1975 either recruit a new staff with this expertise
or make arrangement for suitable training for one of its staff. Up to
$15,000 of the proposed IDA Credit could be used for training abroad.
3.07      Organization.  DFCC's organizational structure is shown in the
attached Chart. There are five departments, Project Evaluation, Project
1/   To be appointed by the Minister of Industries and Scientific Affairs;
the other Government director is appointed by the Minister of Finance.



- 12 -
Implementation, Legal Affairs, Accounts and Administration, and a Con-
sultancy Unit. Following the decrease in staff in FY73, two Assistant
General Manager posts were abolished. Given the current size of the staff,
intervening positions between the General Manager and the department heads
are not necessary. Responsibilities of each department are clearly defined.
The consultancy unit, established in 1969, was originally intended to pro-
vide prospective investors with consultancy services such as project feasi-
bility studies and market surveys (for a fee), and also to undertake project
appraisals for other financial institutions. However, largely because of
the low investment activity in the private sector, this unit has not been
fully utilized; the staff (two engineers and a management consultant) have
spent about half their time on DFCC's own project appraisal and supervision.
Policies and Procedures
3.08      Minimum Lending Limit.  DFCC's Statement of Policy (Annex 6) has
remained essentially unchanged since July 1969, and continues to provide
sound guidelines for its operations. In September 1974, DFCC lowered its
normal minimum limit for a single loan or investment from Rs 100,000 to
Rs 75,000. This was a follow-up to the earlier removal of the "limited
liability company" restriction for eligible recipients (para 3.01).
3.09      Lending Terms.  Since January 1970, DFCC has charged 10.5% pa on
both rupee and foreign currency loans; but rupee loans, if refinanced by the
Central Bank, are extended at 9.5% pa. Foreign currency loans are subject
to a commitment charge of 1.25% pa. DFCC also charges an appraisal fee of
0.5% on rupee loans and 1% on foreign currency loans. DFCC's rupee lending
rate is roughly in line with commercial banks' rates on term loans secured
by immovable property. These range between 8% and 11%, while those charged
by AICC on project loans range between 9% and 10% (Annex 2). However, given
the scarcity of foreign exchange, there is need to encourage a more economic
use of foreign currency resources, even though import transactions under
foreign currency loans are carried out at the FEEC exchange rate 1/. Because
of this and taking into account the recent price trends (para 2.07), it was
agreed during negotiations that DFCC's foreign currency lending rate under
this Credit would be increased to 12% pa. However, to encourage the
development of small scale enterprises, it was also agreed that DFCC would
lend to units whose fixed assets, excluding land, do not exceed Rs 200,000
at a special rate of 10% pa. Government would continue to take the foreign
exchange risk.  Government risk-taking would be justified mainly because
passing on the risk.to sub-borrowers at this juncture would create an
unnecessary additional element of uncertainty in the private sector invest-
ment climate. Adjustment of the rupee currency lending rate is not recom-
mended at present, awaiting the result of the Central Bank's review of the
structure of interest rates (para 2.26).
I/  Foreign currency loans are lent to clients at the parity rate, but clients
must pay the Government the FEEC premium (65% of the parity exchange
rate) for the goods imported under the loans.



- 13 -
3.10      DFCC usually lends at maturities ranging between 5 and 16 years.
It normally requires a primary mortgage on the borrowing company's fixed
assets; the loan is usually limited to 75% of the value of land and build-
ings and 60% of the cost of machinery to be acquired. In addition, bank
guarantees or personal guarantees of the major sponsors are sometimes re-
quired. DFCC also requires that the sponsors provide a reasonable propor-
tion of the finance needed so that the project's debt/equity ratio can be
maintained at about 1:1.
3.11      Investment Policies.  While the Act empowers DFCC to underwrite
security issues, it has so far undertaken only two such operations (both in
the mid-1960's), mainly because of the general preference in Sri Lanka for
closely held company ownership. DFCC's direct subscription to shares has
also been small in recent years because very few new shares have been issued
in the market since 1970, reflecting uncertainties in the investment climate.
As a matter of policy, DFCC has subscribed to more preference shares than
ordinary shares. Given the small capital market, investment in ordinary
shares means freezing funds, whereas preference shares, which normally are
redeemable, allow DFCC to revolve its funds. All preference shares held
by DFCC have a fixed dividend rate, which has recently been 11% pa.
3.12      DFCC normally limits share investment in a single enterprise to
below 25% of the enterprise's issued share capital or 10% of DFCC's equity
(plus the outstanding amount of the subordinated Government loan), whichever
is lower. Also, the aggregate of DFCC's share investments is not allowed
to exceed the sum of its equity and the outstanding amount of the subor-
dinated Government loan. These exposure limits are reasonable and all
DFCC's investments have been within them.
3.13      Appraisal Procedure.  DFCC's involvement in project appraisal
normally takes place at a relatively late stage. Project proposals are
first screened by the Ministry of Industries or other relevant Ministries
(hotel projects are examined by the Ceylon Tourist Board which is under the
Ministry of Shipping and Tourism). Industrial projects involving no foreign
participation 1/ are finally scrutinized by an inter-ministerial committee
(Local Investment Advisory Committee - LIAC) mainly on the basis of their
foreign exchange earning potential, contribution to the rural sector, degree
of dependence on imported raw materials and use of locally manufactured
machinery and inputs. After the LIAC's license has been issued a private
project needing foreign machinery is referred to DFCC.  Normally by this
stage, some of the important project elements (such as site) have been
decided, and the leeway left for DFCC to modify the project design is
fairly limited.  In the past, when the proceeds of the previous IBRD loans
were being utilized, Government invited DFCC staff as consultants (in an
individual capacity) to participate in preliminary discussions on project
proposals, but this practice has been discontinued for several years. The
1/   Projects with foreign capital participation are examined by the Foreign
Investment Advisory Committee.



-  14 -
Ministry of Industries now intends to resume inviting DFCC staff, to early
discussions on private investment proposals needing DFCC finance. DFCC's
experience and expertise in project appraisal would usefully contribute to
the selection of sound projects.
3.14      Appraisal Standards.  In its appraisal, DFCC closely examines
the engineering aspects, the marketability of the product, the company's
financial viability and the comp-tence of management. In general, DFCC's
appraisal is thorough and the quality of analysis of these aspects is good.
On the other hand, DFCC's economic analysis leaves room for improvement.
Although it calculates some partial indicators of economic justification
(such as employment effects and net foreign exchange earnings/savings),
it does not make an overall economic evaluation. During negotiations, an
understanding was reached with DFCC that it will cover the economic impact
of projects more thoroughly in its appraisal and in particular will calculate
the economic rate of return for all projects costing Rs 1 million or more,
and the domestic resource cost per unit of foreign exchange earned/saved for
all projects costing between Rs 0.5 and up to Rs 1.0 million to gauge the
economic viability of projects. DFCC has three senior staff members who have
been trained at the EDI and who are capable of making such evaluations.
3.15      Also, since many industries are currently suffering from low
utilization of existing capacity, DFCC intends to pay particular attention
to this aspect in its project appraisal to ensure that its financing does
not create additional excess capacity.
3.16      Procurement and Disbursement Procedures.  For procurement of
foreign machinery, DFCC usually requires the prospective investor to
obtain several quotations from well-known foreign suppliers. The quota-
tions are examined mainly for pricing, delivery, quality of equipment,
availability of spare parts, warranty conditions and the supplier's
ability to furnish technicians for installation and training of local
staff. After the supplier has been selected, investors are also required
to furnish an assurance from a reputable firm of international surveyors
that the plant and machinery to be purchased meet the required specifica-
tions, are in good working order and are reasonably priced. For civil
works, DFCC normally insists on competitive bidding by a number of selected
contractors. DFCC's procurement procedures are satisfactory.
3.17      Disbursement of rupee funds is authorized by the Accounting
Department either against the presentation of invoices or after checking
the physical progress of construction work. In any case, DFCC ensures
that the sponsors have contributed their funds in a prescribed manner.
Because IBRD has been DFCC's only source of foreign exchange, disburse-
ment of foreign exchange has been made in accordance with the Bank's dis-
bursement procedures. DFCC's own disbursement procedures are sound.
3.18      Project Supervision.  DFCC follows-up projects through reports
from clients, visits to project sites and, in some cases, representation
on the Board of client companies. DFCC regularly receives and reviews



- 15 -
annual financial statements of its clients. Site visits take place every
quarter during project construction, but after project completion, visits
are infrequent. Only 35% of projects in operation were visited in FY74,
though the percentage increased from 24% in FY73. Although most clients
are performing well, DFCC needs to increase the frequency of its post-
financing visits which it informed us during negotiations that it intends
to do. DFCC is represented on the Board of 15 client companies (out of 82)
most of which are ones in which it holds shares. Generally, DFCC's project
supervision is reasonably good.
Relations with Government, and Business and Financial Communities
3.19      DFCC's relations with Government have become closer.  The April
1974 amendments to the Act empowered the Minister of Finance to give
directives to DFCC (after consultation with DFCC's Board) in matters of
general policy, added another Government director to the Board, and made
the appointment of DFCC's Chairman subject to the approval of the Minister
of Planning and Economic Affairs. These amendments indicate an increasing
Government interest in DFCC's role, but there are no signs that Government
intends to interfere in DFCC's daily operations. In fact, DFCC Board mem-
bers consider the enlarged Government representation useful for increased
contacts and better coordination with the Ministries of Industries and
Planning. To complement these Board level relationships, DFCC is planning
to enlarge its contacts at staff level with the Ministries and other Gov-
ernment agencies concerned with industrial development. The proposed
participation by DFCC staff in project licensing could provide a useful
opportunity for DFCC to contribute to Government policy in project selec-
tion and also to serve as a channel of communication between Government and
private-sector entrepreneurs.
3.20      DFCC's image in the business community is improving.  In the past,
clients complained about the time taken in processing loans (in comparison
with commercial banks) and the amount of data and information DFCC requires,
but these complaints are now voiced less frequently. Clients increasingly
appreciate DFCC's advice and assistance in formulating their proposals, im-
proving their cost estimates and preparing financial forecasts. On its part,
DFCC has been able to expedite its processing of loan applications by start-
ing preliminary appraisal on the basis of whatever information is available,
instead of awaiting the applicant's submission of complete data.
3.21      DFCC has had good relations with the commercial banks.  In
particular, these have traditionally been close with the Bank of Ceylon
(BOC). BOC is DFCC's largest shareholder, has always been represented
on the Board, and has been an important source of DFCC's lending funds.
For a large number of projects, BOC has guaranteed DFCC's loans and pro-
vided working capital. BOC has also been a main client of DFCC's con-
sultancy services. Since 1972, DFCC has undertaken six assignments for
BOC including project appraisal, valuation of machinery and evaluation
of civil engineering contracts.

IV.  RESOURCE MOBILIZATION
4.01      DFCC has been exclusively dependent on IBRD loans for its foreign
currency resources, and heavily dependent on official funds (both Government
and the Central Bank) for its rupee resources. Although it has tried several
times to diversify its sources of foreign exchange funds and to mobilize do-
mestic private savings directly, the country's economic situation has frus-
trated its efforts. Since 1966 rupee resource mobilization from the public
has been limited to utilization of commercial bank credits.
Foreign Currency Resources
4.02      DFCC has obtained two IBRD loans totalling $12 million.  The first
of $4 million was made in 1967 and the second of $8 million in 1969. Mow-
ever, the change in Government in 1970 and the subsequent slow-down in pri-
vate investment not only reduced new applications for loans but also caused
major cancellations of approved DFCC loans in FY71 and FY72. As a result,
DFCC was forced to cancel more than half ($6.8 million) the total loan
amounts. As DFCC's business picked up again in the past two years, the
balance of the second loan was fully committed by end-1973. DFCC's for-
eign currency resources at the end of FY74 were as follows (Rs '000):
IBRD loans (net of cancellations and repayments)          26,544
Less:  Loans and investments outstanding                  19,249
Resources available for disbursement                       7,295
Less:  Resources committed but not yet disbursed           7,295
Resources available for commitment                          nil
4.03      At various times in the past, DFCC has contacted official foreign
institutions (including KfW) for foreign currency loans, but has so far been
unsuccessful. It faced competition from the Government in tapping these
sources. Prospects of tapping commercial sources of foreign funds are
almost nil at present, because of the country's creditworthiness position.
Rupee Resources
4.04      At the end of FY74, DFCC's rupee resources totalled Rs 54.6 million
as detailed below. However, its rupee loans and investments outstanding to-
gether with its committed but undisbursed resources amounted to Rs 64.8 mil-
lion, leaving an overcommitment of Rs 10.2 million. A summary of its re-
source position at the end of FY74 is as follows (Rs '000):



- 17 -
Share Capital                                  8,000
Reserves and surplus /a                        2,025
Government loan (subordinated)                16,000
Central Bank refinancing /b                   19,579
Bank of Ceylon credit facility               _9,000
Total               54,604
Less: Rupee loans and investments
outstanding                                 49,426

Less: Resources committed but not yet

Rupee resources available for commitment   -10,218
/a   Excluding special reserves (Rs 2 million) which
DFCC is required to maintain in the form of
fixed deposits.
/b   Outstanding balance.
4.05      DFCC intended to raise its share capital from Rs 8 million to
Rs 16 million in 1970 but did not do so because of the change in the pri-
vate investment climate. The 1956 Government loan is repayable over 40
years (including 30 years grace 1/) and subordinated to share capital.
The loan is interest free and represents 30% of DFCC's rupee resources
raised by the end of FY74.
4.06      The refinance facility at the Central Bank is available for term
loans (both industrial and agricultural) extended by financial institutions
including commercial banks. The interest rate charged by the Central Bank
is 6.5% pa and the primary lender is allowed a maximum margin of 3%. The
refinance period is up to 15 years. While no ceiling is set on the re-
finance available for individual institutions, the Central Bank has in the
past several years restricted it to loans extended to unclearly-defined
"broad-based" public limited companies. As a result, resort to this facil-
ity by DFCC and other institutions has declined recently. In the past year,
however, interpretation of the eligibility of access to this facility has
been relaxed.
4.07      The credit facility with BOC has a maximum limit of Rs 9 million,
of which Rs 2 million could be in overdrafts. Any amount of outstanding
overdraft could be converted to term loans, repayable over ten years. Such
credit carries interest at 7.5% pa and is secured by DFCC's share investment
portfolio. On March 31, 1974, borrowings from BOC were Rs 2.8 million, all
in term loans.
1/   Repayment starts in 1986.



- 18 -
4.08      A rapid increase in rupee lending in FY74 (mostly for hotel
projects) created a strain on I)FCC's rupee resources, resulting in an
overcommitment of Rs 10.2 million at the end of the year.  Of this, a minimum
of about Rs 6.2 million could be refinanced under the Central Bank's refinance
facility, and in October 1974, DFCC obtained a new overdraft facility of
Rs 6.5 million from BOC. It is currently negotiating with BOC to convert
this facility into a long term c<-edit. This would ease DFCC resource con-
straint, but does not obviate the ueed to continue mobilizing additional
resources.
4.09      Circumstances continue to be unfavorable for DFCC to raise capital
from the market either through bond issues or a share capital increase. The
bond market is very thin, and the market price of DFCC shares is depressed
(Rs 85 in September 1974 against the par value of Rs 100). Thus, the most
likely sources of rupee funds for the moment are borrowings from the Central
Bank and from other domestic financial institutions. DFCC intends to con-
tinue making efforts to tap new sources of funds.
V. OPERATING RESULTS AND DEVELOPMENTAL IMPACT
Operating Results
5.01      Volume of Operations.  A summary of DFCC's operations from FY70
through FY74 and for the first half of FY75 is in Annex 7. After a dramatic
surge in FY69 and FY70, business declined sharply in the subsequent two years
because of the rapid deterioration in the private investment climate.  Total
net commitments reached a low of Rs 0.9 million in FY72 compared to Rs 21.4
million in FY70. Since then, the climate has somewhat improved owing mainly
to the Government incentives for tourism and export-oriented industries that
led to an improvement in DFCC's business. In the two years through FY74,
net commitments averaged about Rs 18 million a year, comprising rupee loans
of Rs 10.5 million, foreign currency loans of Rs 6.2 million equivalent, and
share investments of Rs 1.3 million. Since inception to September 30, 1974,
DFCC's net commitments were Rs 152.2 million, of which rupee loans consti-
tuted 72%, foreign currency 20% and share investments 8%.
5.02      Size and Maturity.  A breakdown by size and maturity of commit-
ments until the end of September 1974 is shown in Annex .8. The bulk of
DFCC's operations were of a medium and relatively small size.  About 60% of
individual loans and investments made until September 30, 1974 were of less
than Rs 0.5 million ($77,000) and 82% were of less than Rs 1 million ($155,000).
Most DFCC loans (80% by number and 72% by amount) had maturities between
10 and 16 years, with concentration on 10 and 11 years. On the other hand,
loans with maturities less than 5 years were less than 1% of the total amount.



- 19 -
5.03      Sectoral and Geographical Distribution.  The sectoral and geo-
graphical distribution of DFCC's commitments up to September 1974 is given
in Annex 9. The largest number of operations (13.5%) were in food process-
ing, followed by garment manufacturing (9.8%) and tourism and engineering
(each 9.0%). By amounts committed, tourism received the largest share
(19.6%), followed by chemical products and food processing (each 11.2%)
and textiles (10.8%). The rest of DFCC's financing (47.2%) is reasonably
well diversified over a wide range of industries.
5.04      In the past two and a half years the largest commitments
(45% by number and 53% by amount) have been in tourism (Annex 10). As a
result, DFCC's exposure in this sector reached Rs 27 million by the end of
September 1974 (Rs 12 million in outstanding loans and Rs 15 million in un-
disbursed commitments), representing 30% of total portfolio and undisbursed
commitments. Exposure in tourism is expected to continue rising in the next
two years, but DFCC has informed us that it will set a maximum exposure limit
in hotel projects consisting of 45% of its total portfolio.
5.05      79% of projects financed by DFCC are located in and around Colombo,
where industry is concentrated. The lack of adequate infrastructure and of
effective Government incentives have limited projects in less-developed
areas. But because Government has recently been encouraging projects out-
side Colombo, and establishing industrial estates in different parts of the
country, and since most future hotel projects are being planned outside
Colombo, DFCC's future financing should show a more even geographical dis-
tribution.
Developmental Impact
5.06      General.  Towards the end of the 1960's DFCC embarked on an ambitious
lending program and succeeded in increasing its lending by tenfold over three
years, but the subsequent change in the Government's attitude towards the
private sector curtailed its initiative. DFCC's efforts since inception
have focused on financially attractive projects with the intention of building
a strong portfolio and maintaining a sound financial position. Its manage-
ment is now conscious of the need to make additional efforts to identify
and promote projects, to help out new entrepreneurs and to influence in-
dustrial policies.
5.07      In recent years, Government has recognized a definite role for
the private sector in export-oriented and tourist industries and in medium
and small scale projects, wherein DFCC could play a more active developmental
role. DFCC has prepared a development strategy (Annex 11) in which it
expressed its intention to give first priority to export and tourist oriented
industry financing in the next two to three years. It will finance import
substitution projects, but in these, it intends to give preference to projects
in industries with relatively high level of capacity utilization and to
balancing, modernization and replacement projects. It may also finance
one or two projects, possibly with foreign collaboration directed to the



- 20 -
cultivation and processing of non-traditional agriculture. DFCC also intends
to move gradually into small scale sector financing and to play promotional
role, in helping with regional distribution of industry, identifying,
improving and screening project and policy ideas emanating from the private
sector, and advising Government on these ideas. It could thus become a
useful and effective channel of communication between the private sector and
the Government. The intended involvement of DFCC into an earlier stage of
project consideration by Government (para. 3.13) would enable it to work
with Government on influencing project design and location and helping en-
courage their establishment in or near the newly established industrial
estates. DFCC's continued financing of hotels that are widely distributed
throughout Sri Lanka will also be a useful contribution to regional develop-
ment.
5.08      Small Scale Sector Financing:  As mentioned above, the bulk of DFCC
operations were of medium and relatively small size (para 5.02). Likewise
the recipients of its financing are basically medium and smaller scale
enterprises. During the three year period through FY72, 68% of DFCC's
individual loans and investments were made to comPanies whose fixed assets
(after completion of the project) were less than US$0.5 million (15% were for
companies whose fixed assets were less than US$100,000). This trend con-
tinued over the past two years. There is no official definition of small
scale industries in Sri Lanka, but such industries have sometimes been
defined in terms of enterprises whose fixed assets do not exceed Rs 200,000
(US$31,000). Following the amendment of the DFCC Act in 1974, empowering it
to provide finance to proprietorships, partnerships and cooperatives, and
the lowering of its minimum lending limit to Rs 75,000 (US$11,600), DFCC
is expected to finance more small uni  some of which would be within this
definition. A portion of the credit (US$200,000) is proposed to be
specifically allocated to such small enterprises. In this work, DFCC in-
tends to collaborate with the Industrial Development Board (a statutory
body under the Ministry of Industries) which undertakes feasibility studies
on projects considered to be small scale industry and provides technical
services to such projects. In view of its small staff and its inexperience
in the very small scale sector, DFCC intends to move slowly into this area
since investments in it will require intensive supervision and technical
assistance. The Government has not yet formulated a coherent policy and
incentive schemes for promoting the very small scale sector (Annex 1) and
in the course of implementing this project IDA and the Government will
examine more closely the ability of DFCC and other agencies to play a more
effective role in assisting this sector.
5.09      Performance of Assisted Projects.  There is insufficient data to
measure quantitatively the impact of DFCC's finance on Sri Lanka's capital
formation. From its inception through FY73, DFCC provided Rs 133 million
to 92 companies (for 162 projects), of which 71 were in operation at the
end of FY73. 1/ Some economic indicators for these companies are shown in
1/   The other 21 companies either had repaid their loans or were still
constructing their projects.



- 21 -
Annex 12. During FY73, their total output was some Rs 990 million, their
value-added Rs 530 million and their employment 24,600, although these
figures are not entirely attributable to DFCC assistance. DFCC-assisted
companies accounted for an estimated 12% of total value-added and 5% of
total employment in the industrial and tourism sectors. Total capital
employed by DFCC-assisted companies was Rs 413 million, indicating that
the combined capital/employment ratio of these companies was relatively
low (Rs 16,800 or $2,600 per worker). On average, DFCC provided about 16%
of project costs.
5.10      Most of the companies financed by DFCC produce for the local
market, but over the past two years there has been a growth in assistance
to export-oriented industries (including hotels). Those companies earning
foreign exchange increased from 15 in FY72 to 18 in FY73, and their gross
foreign exchange earning increased from Rs 21 million to Rs 30 million.
Although their export sales in FY73 were only 3% of total output of DFCC-
financed companies, they represented an estimated 9% of the country's total
industrial Pxports and tourism earnings.
VI. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Profitability
6.01      DFCC's income statements for FY70 through FY74 and for the first
half of FY75 are shown in Annex 13. Certain performance indicators are
shown below:
As % of average total assets:         FY70    FY71   FY72   FY73   FY74
Gross income                           7.1     8.4    8.3    8.3    9.0
Financial expenses                     2.3     3.9    3.7    3.4    3.6
Administrative expenses                1.6      1.5    1.3    1.2    1.1

Profits before tax                     3.0      2.8    3.1    3.3    3.5
Net profits as % of:
Average net worth                      9.3     9.7    9.2    8.4    8.3
Year-end share capital                12.4    13.4   13.0   12.1   12.3
6.02      The sharp decline in business in FY71 and FY72 considerably slowed
down the growth of income in subsequent years, but DFCC has maintained a
moderate level of profitability, mainly by cutting down on its administra-
tive expenses.  Gross income grew at an average rate of 4% pa. between
FY71 and FY74, compared with a 40% annual growth over the previous three
years (income decreased by 6.2% in FY73). DFCC's administrative expenses
have continued to decline since FY72 both in absolute amounts and as a
percentage of average total assets. As a result, profits before tax have



- 22 -
steadily increased, from Rs 1.9 million in FY71 (2.8% of average total
assets) to Rs 2.5 million in FY74 (3.5%). Net profits have decreased in
FY72 and FY73 due to an increase in the income tax rate. DFCC has provided
an increasing amount of its revenues for doubtful loans and investments:
from Rs 100,000 in FY71 to Rs 550,000 in FY74. These provisions are not
related to specific loans from which DFCC expects losses, but are in the
nature of general reserves. DFCC has paid dividends at 8% since FY68.
Financial Position
6.03      Annexes 14 and 15 show DFCC's balance sheets and cash flow state-
ments from FY70 to FY74 and for the first half of FY75. After reaching its
previous peak of Rs 70.2 million in FY71, DFCC's portfolio (net of provi-
sions) dropped in the subsequent two years to Rs 64.9 million in FY73; it
rose again to Rs 70.8 million in Septenber 1974. While share capital re-
mained the same over the period, DFCC's reserves increased to Rs 4 million
at the end of FY74. The DFCC Act requires that at least 20% of annual net
profits be set aside as special reserves so long as the subordinated Gov-
ernment loan is outstanding. The special reserves were Rs 2 million at the
end of FY74 and are invested in fixed deposits at rates ranging from 5 to 7%.
6.04      As shown below, DFCC's total long-term debt/equity ratio moved
between 4.2 and 5.3 over the past five years. The debt/equity ratio as
defined in the last IBRD Loan Agreement ranged between 2.1 and 2.8 over
the same period, against the contractual limit of 3.0. DFCC's debt serv-
ice coverage also remained satisfactory over the period except in FY73
when the ratio dropped to 1.1 as a result of reduced earnings.
FY70    FY71    FY72    FY73    FY74
Total long-term debt/equity ratio   4.2       5.3      5.3     4.7      4.8

Quality of Portfolio
6.05      DFCC's total portfolio at the end of September 1974 was Rs 72.8
million representing 72 loans and 24 investments in 82 companies. Its
portfoliQ is reasonably well diversified amongst a wide range of indus-
tries. DFCC's largest exposure in a single enterprise was Rs 4.4 million,
representing 15% of DFCC's equity plus subordinated Government loan.  This
compares with a maximum exposure of 20% set in its policy statement. There
are three other companies in which its exposure exceeds Rs 3 million. All
four companies are operating profitably.
6.06      Loan Portfolio.  DFCC's arrears position for the past three and
a half years is shown in Annex 16. On September 30, 1974, only four com-
panies were in arrears over three months, with aggregate outstanding prin-
cipal of Rs 2.6 million (4.1% of total loan portfolio) and actual arrears
of Rs 490,000 (0.8%). Debt service performance of DFCC's clients has been



- 23 -
traditionally good, except in FY72 and FY73 when the insurgency and wide-
spread labor disputes caused business setbacks and temporary liquidity
problems for some borrowers. While the year-end levels of arrears remained
low, DFCC rescheduled four loans totalling Rs 8.5 million in FY72 and three
loans totalling Rs 5.4 million in FY73 (for a further two to three years).
Only one loan involving Rs 518,000 was rescheduled in FY74.  Except for
one, all clients whose loans were rescheduled in the past three years have
since been repaying regularly.
6.07      Of the four companies currently in arrears, two have been in
default for more than two years, and legal action is being taken for
recovery. Should none of the arrears be recovered, Rs 195,000 would
have to be written off. Accumulated provisions against bad debts at
the end of FY74 were Rs 1.4 million, which would be more than sufficient
to cover these possible losses. Since its inception, DFCC has written off
Rs 366,000 on two loans, representing only 0.3% of its cumulative disburse-
ments through FY74.
6.08      There are six other companies which are currently operating at a
loss or are in technical, financial or managerial difficulties. DFCC has
remained in close touch with them and has advised them on the necessary
remedial measures, including diversification of products, balancing of
equipment and improvement of labor-management relationships.
6.09      Investment Portfolio.  DFCC's investment portfolio (Rs 9.0 mil-
lion in 21 companies) as of September 30, 1974 constituted 30% of its equity
plus subordinated Government loan, as against the policy limit of 100%.
Most of the investments are in preference shares (Rs 6.9 million in 14
companies) privately placed with DFCC, and almost all are redeemable at
par on dates agreed at the time of issue. Since none of them is quoted
on the Colombo stock exchange, they have no market price. However, their
aggregate net worth at the end of September 1974 was Rs 7.7 million or 12%
above their acquisition cost (Annex 17). DFCC does not expect any loss
from these investments. The average yield on preference shares increased
from 4.2% in FY73 to 5.3% in FY74.
6.10      DFCC has ordinary share investment totalling Rs 2.2 million (at
cost to DFCC) in nine companies. 1/ Eight are operating profitably and one
is making losses. DFCC is doubtful if it will recover its investment of
Rs 50,000 in the loss-making company. Against this, provisions for doubtful
investments were Rs 650,000 as of March 31, 1974. On the basis of stock
market prices and book values on March 31, 1974 2/ DFCC's ordinary share
investments are estimated to be worth Rs 4.2 million, about twice their
acquisition cost of Rs 2.2 million.  The average return on these invest-
ments improved from 6.4% in FY73 to 7.5% in FY74.
1/   Including two companies in which DFCC has preference shares as well.
2/   Only three of the nine companies have their shares quoted on the stock
exchange.



- 24 -
Audit
6.11      DFCC's accounts have always been approved without qualification
by the firms of chartered accountants, Ford, Rhodes, Thornton & Co. and
Satchithananda, Schokman, Wijeyeratne & Co. IBRD has found their long-
form audit report of good quality.
VII. PROSPECTS
General Outlook
7.01      Private-sector confidence has not yet fully recovered, partly
because of the remaining uncertainty about the sector's future role.
However, the strong incentives provided by Government to export-oriented
and tourism industries have drawn an active response from private entre-
preneurs and a momentum is gradually building up for new investment in
these industries. The incentives have also stimulated existing industries
to modernize and balance their production facilities to manufacture goods
of exportable quality. While no significant increase in new investment can
be expected from industries producing for the domestic market, there is a
substantial pent up demand, even from these industries, for replacement and
balancing equipment arising from the prolonged non-availability of foreign
exchange.
Business Forecast
7.02      DFCC's business projections for FY75 through FY79 are shown in
Annex 18. Commitments of loans and investments are forecast as below (Rs
million):
Foreign               Local Currency
Currency Loans       Loans     Investments         Total
FY74 (Actual)         3.1            15.4            -              18.5
FY75                   -              3.0           0.3              3.3
FY76                 12.0             7.0           0.5             19.5
FY77                 17.1             8.0           0.5             25.6
FY78                 11.0             9.0           1.0             21.0
FY79                 18.1             9.0           1.0             28.1
7.03      DFCC expects a sharp drop in commitments during FY75 because it
has fully committed the second IBRD loan ?nd because it faced rupee resource
constraint (para 4.08). Foreign currency commitments in FY76 and FY77 are
based on projects most likely to materialize among those already identified
and for which Government approval has been or is likely to be granted.
7.04      By the end of January 1975 DFCC had identified 54 projects.  Of
these 26 are in the tourism sector and consists of 24 hotels (1,209 rooms)
and 2 tourist transport projects. These hotels represent 45% of total



- 25 -
capacity expansion planned by 1977. Direct foreign exchange costs for these
projects are estimated at $1.6 million; in addition, they would involve
indirect foreign exchange costs of $1.2 million on account of the import
content of goods that could be bought "off the shelf" in Sri Lanka. These
include such items as kitchen facilities, air conditioning units, fixtures
and sanitary and electrical equipment etc. This would put the foreign
exchange demand from these tourism projects at $2.8 million. In addition,
about Rs 10 million of their rupee costs is expected to require DFCC
financing.
7.05      Of the remaining 28 projects, 10 with a foreign exchange content
of $2.2 million belong to export-oriented industries and 18 with a foreign
exchange content of $2.0 million are of an import-substitution nature.
The sponsors of the above 28 projects expressed the desire to proceed with
their plans despite recent Government intentions to modify some of the
fiscal incentives (para 2.12).
7.06      Thus, the above-mentioned projects have a foreign exchange component
of $7.0 million (including $1.2 million representing the indirect costs for
the tourism projects). About 40% is for tourism projects, 30% for export-
oriented projects and the remainder is for import-substitution projects.
DFCC's lower projection of foreign exchange commitments (Rs 29.1 million or
$4.5 million), is justifiable for two reasons. Firstly, the project list is
by no means definitive. Many of the candidate projects, particularly those
in the industrial sector, are in a preliminary stage of planning. Secondly,
in view of the widespread low capacity utilization among existing industries,
DFCC intends to examine with much rigor in its appraisals the prospects for
capacity utilization of these projects, particularly those producing for the
domestic market, with the possible result that some will be rejected (para
3.15).
Resource Needs
7.07      Foreign Currency.  As shown above, DFCC's projected new commit-
ments in foreign exchange are Rs 29.1 million ($4.5 million) through FY77.
DFCC currently has no uncommitted foreign exchange resources and no new
loans from bilateral or other international sources are likely to materialize
in the immediate future. Therefore an IDA Credit of $4.5 million would meet
DFCC's estimated foreign exchange requirements through FY77.
7.08      Local Currency.  DFCC had overcommitted its rupee resources by
Rs 10.2 million as of end-FY74 (para 4.08). Over the next three years
through FY77, its projected new commitments of rupee loans and invest-
ments are Rs 19.3 million (table below). A significant portion of this will
go to projects receiving foreign currency financing also. Against these
projected commitments, Rs 21.5 million will be available from loan collec-
tions and share redemptions and Rs 3.2 million from internal cash generation
over the same period. In addition, a new overdraft limit of Rs 6.5 million



- 26 -
has been obtained from BOC during FY75 which is currently being converted
into a long term credit facility. The balance of DFCC's borrowings from the
Central Bank refinance facility shows a projected drop of Rs 2.8 million
over the next two years, but DFCC explained during negotiations that access
to this facility has recently eased and the drop may more likely be half
the previously projected amount or may not materialize at all.  Thus DFCC
expects to have sufficient rupee resources to cover its projected commitments
in the next two years. However, it intends to continue making efforts to
tap new sources of funds.

Financial Projections
7.09      Projected income statements for FY75 through FY79 are given
in Annex 19. Net profits after tax are expected to grow from Rs 984,000
in FY75 to Rs 1.3 million in FY79. The return on share capital should
increase from 12.3% in FY75 to 15.7% in FY79. While DFCC expects to in-
crease its dividend rate from the current 8% to 9% in FY77, the pay-out
ratio would decline from 65% in FY75 to 57.4% in FY79. Rising profit-
ability would allow DFCC to set aside increasing amounts as bad-debt pro-
visions (from Rs 575,000 in FY75 to Rs 850,000 in FY79) and as reserves
(from Rs 340,000 to Rs 495,000). Administrative expenses would be main-
tained in the range of 1.1% to 1.2% of average total assets.
7.10      Projected balance sheets and cash flow statements through FY79
are shown in Annexes 20 and 21.  DFCC's total assets are projected to
increase at an average rate of 8% pa (from Rs 79.9 million in FY75 to
Rs 107.3 million in FY79), mainly because of a fast growing loan portfolio
from FY77 onwards. Reserves and provisions would increase from 8.9% in FY74
to 10.7% in FY79 of total portfolio. DFCC's debt service coverage would
remain above 1.4 throughout the projected period.



- 27 -
7.11      Debt/Equity Ratio.  DFCC's total long-term debt/equity ratio
(including the total outstanding amount of the subordinated Government
loan in debt) would move over the next five years as follows:
FY75    FY76    FY77    FY78    FY79
Total long term debt/equity ratio  5.2       4.9      5.4     6.0      6.3
7.12      The previous loan agreement between IBRD and DFCC (634-CE) set a
debt/equity limit of 3:1 using the definition that the portion of the Gov-
ernment loan which falls due after the last maturity of the IBRD Loan is
excluded from debt and included in equity. This definition, however, lacks
conceptual clarity and does not help reveal the actual leverage on DFCC's
real equity. It has tl-lerefore been agreed that the debt/equity limit under
this IDA Credit be defined on the basis of total long term debt and equity.
DFCC would be allowed a debt/equity limit of 7:1 according to the new
definition. Since DFCC's total long term debt/equity ratio has in the past
reached 5.3:1 (para 6.04), the new limit in fact does not represent a
significant increase in DFCC's leverage. This limit is also justified by
DFCC's sound management, its good portfolio and the ample debt service
coverage expected over the coming five years. DFCC's projections indicate
that the debt/equity ratio would be maintained below the new limit through
FY79.
VIII.  MAIN FEATURES OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
8.01      Use of Credit Proceeds.  The Credit would mainly be used to meet
the CIF cost of capital goods imported for projects financed by DFCC.  It
would also cover 65% of the cost of imported capital goods bought "off the
shelf" in Sri Lanka for tourism projects financed by DFCC, representing
their average import content (indirect foreign exchange cost). US$200,000
of the Credit will be specifically allocated for lending to small enter-
prises whose fixed assets do not exceed Rs 200,000 and upto US$15,000 would
be available for training abroad of DFCC staff in hotel project appraisal
and supervision.
8.02      On-lending Terms.  The principal terms and conditions of on-lend-
ing under the Credit would be as follows: (a) Government would lend the
Credit proceeds to DFCC at an interest rate of 8.5% pa. Repayments to Govern-
ment would be made within 15 years including grace, on a flexible amortization
schedule in approximate conformity with repayments received by DFCC from
sub-borrowers; and (b) DFCC would on-lend to sub-borrowers at an interest
rate of 12% pa except to small scale enterprises (those whose fixed assets
do not exceed Rs 200,000) where a 10% pa would be applied. DFCC can afford
such a concessionary rate. The weighted spread to DFCC on the proceeds
of the IDA Credit would be about 3.4% and the spread on DFCC's overall
debt resources (including the interest free Government loan) would be 4.2%
in FY79. The repayment period for individual sub-loans would not exceed
15 years including grace.



- 28 -
8.03      Foreign Exchange Risk.  The foreign exchange risk would be assumed
by Government, as under the previous two IBRD loans to DFCC (para 3.09).
8.04      Free Limit.  The free limit under the Credit would be $150,000,
compared to $100,000 under the second loan of 1969.  With this limit, IDA
would receive for prior approval about one-fifth by number (8-10 projects)
and about 60% by amount of total loans to be made under the Credit. Require-
ment of prior IDA approval of a part of DFCC's sub-projects is still needed
to maintain a dialogue with DFCC on project appraisal, especially in view
of the expected introduction of economic appraisal techniques (para 3.14)
which are new to many DFCC staff.
8.05      Disbursement.  The schedule of expected Credit disbursements is
given in Annex 22. The Closing Date would be September 30, 1979.



ANNEX 1
Page 1
DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION OF CEYLON
Government Policies on Private Sector and Small Industries
1.        Roles of Public and Private Sectors.  Immediately after it came to
power in 1970, Government announced that "the heavy and capital goods indus-
tries and other suitable basic industries will be state-owned. Other in-
dustries will be assigned to the cooperatives and private enterprises." These
broad definitions of the respective roles of the public and private sectors,
still stand and no further elaborations have since been made. The uncertainty
about the future role of the private sector was compounded by the enactment
of the "Business Undertakings (Acquisition) Act" in October 1971, under
which Government was empowered to take over any private firms at its dis-
cretion. These pronouncements and measures shook the confidence of private
entrepreneurs and contributed to the sharp decline in new private investments
since mid-1970.
2.        Nevertheless, only a few private enterprises have been taken over
by Government under the Acquisition Act and mostly on the charge of mal-
practice. Also the number of state monopolies has not increased, with most
of them (such as steel rolling, petroleum, cement, paper and pulp, tires)
consisting of industries which, given their economies of scale and the small
size of the domestic market, would not warrant operation by more than one
unit. In addition, the recent provision of Government incentives to finance
export-oriented and tourism industries indicates a de facto recognition of
private-sector roles in these fields.  Nevertheless, a clearer demarcation
and positive recognition of private-sector responsibilities by Government
would contribute to the healthy growth of the sector.
3.        Promotion of Small Industries.  Because of its high employment
potential and low foreign exchange requirements, promotion of the small-
scale industrial sector is accorded a high priority in Sri Lanka's develop-
ment. However, Government's approach to the development of the sector has
so far been rather fragmented. There is yet no official definition of small
industry; and while several Government agencies are engaged in project
identification, as well as technical and financial assistance for what they
consider "small industry" there is an apparent duplication of functions,

on the one hand, and a lack of coordination of work, on the other, between
them. 1/ Government has undertaken a series of researches with a view to
identify industries where production by small-scale units could be viable,
but not much progress has been made to date. In the absence of coherent
strategy, Government has not yet established any significant fiscal or other
incentives designed specifically to promote small industries.
1/   Th epartment of Small Industries (Ministry of Industries) provides
technical assistance to handloom and powerloom units of all sizes and
cottage industry with plant and machinery valued at Rs 10,000 or
below. The Industrial Development Board, a statutory body under
the Ministry of Industries, undertakes feasibility studies on projects
considered suitable for small industry (defined as a manufacturing
unit with plant and machinery valued between Rs 10,000 and Rs 200,000
and with no more than 75 employees), provides technical services
and runs pilot projects and several industrial estates. Besides these
two agencies, the Ministry of Planning has under its iurisdiction
some 550 Divisional Development Councils which, scattered all over the
country and each consisting of several Government officials and local
leaders, identify projects (industrial as well as agricultural with
no size limits) and extend financial assistance from the Government
budget.

DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION OF CEYLON
Statement of Policy
(Adopted by the Board of Directors on April 11, 1967
and amended on July 1O, 1969 and on September 5, 197h).
1.       The function of the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon
(the Corporation) is to further the economic development of Ceylon by
assisting in the promotion, establishment, expansion and modernization
of private industrial, agricultural and commercial enterprises in Ceylon
and encouraging the participation of private capital, both internal and
external, in such enterprises.
Commercial enterprises eligible for financing by the Corporation
will include projects in fields such as hotels, transportation, construc-
tion and engineering, which are conducive to the economic development of
Ceylon. However, the Corporation will not finance enterprises which are
solely engaged in trading activities, i.e. the buying and selling of goods.
2.       The Corporation will provide finance in the forms which it con-
siders most appropriate and as empowered by the DFCC Act, namely, by medium
and long-term loans with or without security, by share participation, by
underwriting operations and by guaranteeing loans from other sources.
3.       The Corporation will assist in promoting-the growth of a capital
market in Ceylon by selling investments from its portfolio when it can do
so on satisfactory terms, and by underwriting security issues in suitable
cases.
4.       The Corporation will develop and maintain a strong and well-
balanced organization capable of appraising the projects financed by it
and of assisting its clients, if necessary, in the formulation and execu-
tion of their projects.
5.       The Corporation will ensure that every application for assist-
ance is considered on its financial, technical, and economic merits.
6.       The Corporation will not normally make a loan or a share investment
of less than Cey Rs 75)G6GO 
7.       In considering the amount and form of its financial assistance
to an enterprise, the Corporation will take account of the total financial
requirements of the project and the soundness of the resulting financial
structure for the enterprise.
8.       The Corporation will not in normal circumstances manage enter-
prises which it assists in promoting. It will not seek in any enterprise
it finances a controlling interest or other interest which will give it
the primary responsibility for management of that enterprise. It will not



ANNEX 6
Page 2
normally take up more than 25% of the issued share capital of any individ-
ual enterprise.  Notwithstanding the above limitations, in any case of
jeopardy it may take such action as it considers necessary to protect its
investments.
9.       The Corporation will develop a balanced portfolio by distributing
its loans and share investments among the various economic sectors.
10.      (a)  The aggregate amount of the Corporation's loans to, share
investments in and guarantees on behalf of any individual enterprise will
not normally exceed 20% of the sum of the Corporation's equity and the out-
standing amount of the subordinated Government loan.
(b) The Corporation will not normally commit to any individual
enterprise in the form of share investments more than 10% of the sum of
the Corporation's equity and the outstanding amount of the subordinated
Government loan.
(c) The aggregate of the Corporation's share investments will
not exceed the sum of its equity and the outstanding amount of the sub-
ordinated Government loan.
11.      The Corporation will restrict its long-term indebtedness (not
including the subordinated Government loan) to a maximum of three times
the sum of its equity and the outstanding amount of the subordinated
Government loan.
For the purposes of paragraphs 10 and 11, the Corporation's
equity is defined as the sum of its share capital, surplus and reserves
not allocated to cover specific liabilities.
12.      The Corporation will protect itself fully against any foreign
exchange risks which it may assume in respect of borrowings which are
repayable in foreign currencies.
13.      The Corporation will levy charges for its loans and services
which, together with the earnings on its share investments, will enable
it to pay a satisfactory dividend and to accumulate reserves consistent
with sound financial practice. It will make adequate provisions for bad
debts and other losses on investments. In addition to the special re-
serve the Corporation is required to provide in accordance with the DFCC
Act, it will allocate an adequate portion of its income to a general
reserve, so as to build up total reserves to a level appropriate to the
size and quality of its portfolio of loans and share investments.
14.      Subject to the restriction of dividends as provided in the DFCC
Act and subject to the observance of sound financial policies, the Corpora-
tion will pay such dividends to its shareholders as will give them a reason-
able return on their investments.

Development Strategy
1.        The Government's development objectives as outlined in the Five
Year Plan are:
(a) maximum use of labor;
(b) an investment policy which optimises the use of scarce
foreign exchange resources;
(c) development and diversification of the agricultural sector;
(d) full and efficient utilization of existing industrial plant,
expansion of selected industries and investments in new
industrial projects, on the basis of national priorities;
(e) the development of a new export sector;
(f) the formulation and execution of development projects at
the local level.
2.        Within this framework, DFCC will concentrate in the next two to
three years on the following development activities:
(a) export-oriented industries;
(b) tourism;
(c) import substitution industries;
(d) agro-based industries and non-traditional agriculture.
3.        Export oriented and tourism projects will be given highest
priority because of their foreign exchange earning capacity. Efforts will
be made to encourage export industries which are heavily dependent on local
raw material. In tourism, efforts will be directed towards strengthening
existing resort areas to utilize fully the infrastructure available, and
to set up new hotels, mainly in the outstations, and thereby strengthen the
accommodations available to visitors on round trips of the country. In
addition to new hotels, DFCC will assist in the expansion of existing hotels
and the upgrading of existing facilities.
4.        In import substitution, preference will be given to those
industries which have high capacity utilization, are labor intensive



ANNEX 1 1
Page 2
and are more dependent on local raw material. In particular, DFCC will
endeavor to avoid financing new projects in sectors where existing industrial
units have significant underutilized capacitv resulting from shortage of
imported raw materials and spare parts. It will also give priority to
balancing and modernization projects.
5.        Although DFCC does not intend to undertake agricultural financing
on any significant scale, it may consider financing a few projects, possibly
with foreign collaboration, directed to the cultivation and processing of
non-traditional crops. These projects would be undertaken because of their
potential for export or for import substitution.
6.        The Government has emphasized the need to develop small scale
industry because of its high employment potential and its relatively low
foreign exchange requirement. DFCC intends to move gradually in this
direction. At present DFCC does not have the staff or the expertise to
handle small scale projects which normally require intensive supervision
and technical assistance; but in the next two years, it will attempt to
acquire the necessary staff and start an association with a number of small
scale units.
7.        In promotional work, DFCC will take initiative in identifying,
screening and formulating project proposals in the private sector and in
finding interested sponsors. It will, in particular, collaborate with
Government in focusing on export industries selected for concentrated effort
by Government, (such as ready-made garments, rubber products, sea foods,
tea in tea bags and fruit processing) and on projects located outside
Colombo, in order to help regional distribution of industry. Also DFCC
will attempt to serve as a channel of communication between the Government
and the private sector on matters of mutual interest especially in
transmitting to Government project and industrial policy ideas emanating
from the private sector.
