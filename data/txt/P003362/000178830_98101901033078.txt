I.   INTRODUCTION
1.01       The Government of the Socialist Republic of the UJnion of Burma (the
Government) has requested an IDA Credit of SDR 28.2 million (USS29.7 million
equivalent) to help finance the construction of a textile finishing plant
(the Project) to be located at Shwedaung (near Prome), about 225 km northwest
of Rangoon (IBRD Map No. 17296).  The proceeds of the oroposed Credit would be
on-lent by the Government to the Textile Industries Corporation (TIC, a State
Economic Enterprise) which would execute the Project.
1.02     The proposed IDA Credit would cover about 46% of the total USS65.0
million required to finance the Project, and would represent 100% of the
foreign exchange requirement. Other financing for the Project would include a
direct contribution of US$5.3 million equivalent by TIC, and a Government loan
of US$30.0 million equivalent which would cover the balance of the Project
cost.
1.03     The Project will process 16.6 million linear meters (mlm) of 100%
cotton and cotton polyester-blended fabrics of medium quality for shirting and
suiting for domestic consumption. The grey (unfinished) fabric will be
supplied from existing (TIC) textile operations in Burma. The addition of a
modern efficient finishing plant to TIC's operations will correct a serious
capacity imbalance in the sector, and allow increased production in other
plants of grey fabrics which are now not produced because of a lack of
finishing capacity in the country. Further, some of the grey fabric will be
supplied from small weaving plants which have been forced to add uneconomic
finishing operations because of the lack of such capacity elsewhere.  With the
proposed Project, these plants would be able to shut down their high-cost,
inefficient finishing lines, and concentrate instead on weaving.
1.04       Besides the physical investment under the Project, the Government
will undertake a study of the textile sector which will focus on measures to
improve the productivity of existing plants, as well as on developing a
comprehensive long-term development strategy for the sector. Moreover, the
Project would be instrumental in an eventual organizational restructuring of
the Textile Industries Corporation (TIC), and in upgrading the Financial,
Accounting and Management Information Systems of TIC.
1.05       Bank support for this Project was requested in 1980, and a
reconnaissance mission in June 1981 provided assistance to the Government in
project formulation and planning. A detailed feasibility study was prepared
by TIC, and subsequently reviewed with the Bank-appointed Consultants, Gherzi
Textile Organization of Switzerland in June 1982. A Dreappraisal mission
consisting of Messrs. K. Zamani and H. Oteifa of the Industry Department, and
Mr. A. Ewing, Consultant, took place in October 1982. The Project was
appraised in February 1983 by a mission consisting of Messrs. K. Zamani and
H. Oteifa.

II.   THE SECTOR
A. The Industrial Sector
2.01      The Burmese economy is predominantly based on agriculture, fishing
and forestry, which together contribute about 40% of Gross Domestic Product
(GDP), and employ about 67% of the labor force. The manufacturing sector is
small:  in 1981, it accounted for about 10.5% of GDP, and employed about 7.8%
of the total work force. Of 39,012 industrial establishments, 34,465 (about
88%) were small workshops employing less than ten persons. Only 454 factories
(about 1%) employed 100 or more. During fiscal years 1978/79 through 1981/82,
Burma achieved an average annual GDP growth of 6.7% in real terms, accompanied
by rising exports and stable prices. This record continues the improved
performance which started in the mid-1970s, when the Government initiated a
series of economic reforms that marked the end of a decade-and-a-half of
economic stagnation. The high growth has been largely due to: (i) steadily
rising agricultuaral production; (ii) improved capacity utilization and hence
better performance of industry and transport; and (iii) rapid increases in
investment, particularly in the public sector.
2.02      In 1l964 and 1968, all large and medium-sized industries were
nationalized, leaving the private and cooperative sector with small-scale
industries. In 1981, some 416 (92%) of industrial enterprises employing 100
workers or more were in the public sector. These industrial units, along with
nationalized banks and service companies, are currently grouped into 56 State
Economic Enterprises (SEEs), which together produce about 36% of net national
output. In the industrial sector, the SEEs are divided between two
ministries, roughly corresponding to a division between light industries
producing consumer goods (Ministry of No. I Industry), and heavy industries
(Ministry of No. 2 Industry). The SEE in charge of the textile sector, the
Textile Industries Corporation (TIC), is organized under the Ministry of No. 1
Industry.
2.03      In 1972, faced with mounting financial deficits and low productivity
in many SEEs, the Government adopted a new policy referred to as "The
Guidelines for Operation of State Economic Enterprises Along Commercial
Lines". The introduction of this policy which is still in effect is the
single most important change in the country's economic and industrial policy
since the nationalization of large and medium-size industries in the 1960s.
The main objectives of this policy are to create a quasi-commercial
environment, and to encourage financial discipline by providing autonomy in
administrative and most financial matters to SEE management. Specifically:
(i)  Each SEE has a Management Committee (Board of Directors).l/
The Management Commit.tee concentriates on policy issues leaving
decisions on day-to-day operations to the Managing Director;
1/  The number of members of the Management Committee can vary from five to ten.
Two-thirds of the members are appointed from the officers of the SEE by the
Ministry, and the remaining one-third are appointed from the workers by the
Political Party in coordination with the Central Workers Council. The
Managing Director serves as Chairman of the Management Committee.



- 3 -
(ii)  Under the Guidelines, SEEs pay a "contribution" from profit to
the State, and use the remaining profit to finance a bonus
fund, and to meet working and investment capital requirements.
Any extra capital requirement is borrowed from Myanama Economic
Bank (MEB), a State Development Bank, with interest. All SEEs
observe this financing requirement and this has been remarkably
successful in bringing about financial discipline; and
(iii)  SEEs have the right to revise their prices twice a year subject
to prior approval by the Economic Coordination Committee.
Moreover, the SEEs have the authority to vary their product mix
and introduce new products, and also to procure goods and
services through private and cooperative sectors when the state
sector is not able to provide them.
2.04      Although these provisions have been effective in improving the
performance of SEEs by allowing them a greater degree of independence,
substantial powers remain at a very high level, especially in areas such as
pricing, borrowing, investment, foreign exchange allocations, senior staff
appointments, and major procurement. Thus, the management of the SEEs retain
mainly operational functions, such as routine personnel and procurement
functions, production planning, and marketing, within the parameters of targets
and guidelines. Supervision, and particularly the monitoring of performance
against budget, and control of cash flow, remains at the Ministry level and
above.
2.05      Non state-sector industrial activity comprises the cooperative
movement and the private sector. The cooperative movement, which began in
Burma at the turn of the century, was adopted by the Government in 1962 to
provide the means of socialized organization for economic units too small to
come under direct centralized control. As such, its development was to be
fostered under the twenty-year plan which called for its share of GDP to
increase from 2% to 26% over the plan period, while that of the private sector
was to drop from 70% to 26% (respective shares in 1979/1980 were about 4% and
60%). It was felt that the priority preference given to the cooperative
sector over the private sector in respect of credit, foreign exchange and
materials, would impel private manufacturers and producers into cooperatives
over an acceptable short period. However, the advantages which the
cooperative sector was to enjoy have not materialized to any large extent and
consequently its growth has been much slower than anticipated.
2.06      The private sector, on the other hand, has remained remarkably large
considering the scarce resources that are officially made available to it. In
the industrial sector, private industry accounts for over 80% of employment,
and nearly half of value added. It was private enterprise that provided
virtually all of the growth in the industrial sector in 1979/1980.
B. The Textile Subsector
1. Background
2.07      The textile industry in Burma developed over many years on a small
scale and cottage industry basis. Weaving as a mode of textile production has
been a technical art and is as old as the Burmese culture. There are over



- 4 -
65,000 villages in the country, and in each village, it is quilte customary to
find several households, each having at least one loom, used oln a part-time
basis to produce some kind of home-woven fabrics. In some villages or small
towns, textile weaving using hand looms (and some equipped with a small
motor), together with small-scale yarn dyeing, constitute the main cottage
industry supporting the village population.
2.08      In Burma, although textile production is a traditional industry,
until recent years it was limited to weaving. Small weavers did not normally
invest in fabric finishing, which requires significant investmEnt in production
machinery and associated services. Such facilities as were built to process2/
grey fabrics were mostly primitive and inadequate. Even today, in spite of
reorganization and modernization oE some of the mills, and heavy investments by
the State in a number of vertically integrated textile mills with relatively
modern machinery, the capacity, especially in processing, has still not kept up
with the increase in demand, creating an imbalance in the sector.
2.09      The textile industry in Burma can be ^onsidered as two separate but
related sectors: (i) the private sector, including cooperative establishments;
and (ii) the public sector; prior to and following the Government's
nationalization policy of 1968.  Prior to nationalization, the private sector
played quite an important role in the textile industry.  There were
approximately 5,000 small-scale production units each employing less than nine
workers (in total about 10,000 workers) and some 350 larger units, each
employing ten or more persons (giving employment to over 20,000 workers).
These figures include cooperatives engaged in hand screen printing production.
At the time of nationalization it is estimated that approximately 53% of the
establishments were involved in spinning, weaving and printing, 21% in
knitting, 12% in ginning, 10% in dyeing and printing and about 4% in silk
work. Initially, the State spinning and weaving mill (Thamaing) which started
its operations in 1951, had an installed capacity of 20,000 spindles and 196
looms, used exclusively locally grown short staple cotton fibers, and produced
approximately 1,700 thousand kg of coarse yarn and 2.7 mlm of grey fabrics per
annum. In 1958, some 20,000 additional spindles and 200 looms were installed
at Thamaing, and subsequently, in 1967 and 1968, some 400 new looms capable of
producing finer fabrics based on imported finer cotton yarn were installed
together with the first modern dyeing and finishing facility.  These additions
increased total yarn production from 1,700 thousand kg to 3,600 thousand kg, of
which 2,500 thousand kg were sold to private and cooperatives, and total
weaving capacity from 2.7 mlm to about 10.5 mlm of which some 7 mlm could be
bleached and finished in-house. Thamaing was the only large integrated modern
textile unit in the country and employed some 3,000 workers. In addition to
this mill, a small silk factory and a jute mill, the Government had direct
management control over seven textile mills previously owned by private
industrialists which were taken over due to failure to fulfill their financial
obligation towards the State. In 1968, 60 privately-owned textile mills were
nationalized, which put the Government in control of 70 textile units. These
operations, following a number of reorganizations, regroupings, consolidations
and subsequent expansion, form TIC, which now represents by far the most
significant component of Burma's textile sector.
2/  Fabric processing, which is also referred to as fabric finishing, is the
chemical treatment of grey fabrics through bleaching, dyeing, printing and
finishing to give the required final characteristics to the finished fabric.

2. Structure of the Sector
2.10      Yarn production is concentrated almost exclusively in TIC
establishments. Of the total 257,296 spindles in TIC mills, 246,112 spindles
(96%) are installed in five major TIC mills, and the remaining 11,184 spindles
(4%) are installed in 4 smaller nationalized mills. Weaving capacity is more
widely distributed: in addition to TIC's 5,940 looms in 26 establishments,
there are 4,091 power looms and 5,189 registered handlooms in private sector
mills, and 743 power looms and 122,014 hand looms registered under cooperative
mills. Out of 5,940 looms installed in TIC mills, some 3,192 looms (54%) are
installed in the five major TIC mills. The remaining 2,748 looms are spread
in the 21 smaller nationalized mills. Further, it is estimated that there are
250,000 hand looms which are used intermittently in cottage industry units
throughout the country. The knitting capacity is very small and consists of
187 knitting machines in TIC mills and 167 knitting machines in the
cooperative mills.
2.11      Fabric and yarn processing in the modern sense is concentrated in
TIC, and is only available in the Paleik Textile Complex3/and to a lesser
extent, in the Thamaing Mill (para 2.09).  In 1980/81, the two modern mills
(Paleik and Thamaing) processed about 18 mlm of fabric, of which about 3 mlm
were printed; small mills in total processed about 25.9 mlm of fabric. These
two units originally were designed to provide most of TIC's finishing fabric
requirements, including finishing of most grey fabrics produced in smaller
nationalized mills. However, because of the addition of the two modern
spinning and weaving mills to TIC's operations (Sagaing Textile Mill with
40,000 spindles and with 600 looms in 1972, Meiktila Textile Mill expanded
from 40,000 spindles to 82,400 spindles, and with 600 looms in 1978), without
corresponding expansion of the fabric finishing capacity, many of the smaller
(nationalized) mills were practically denied access to the finishing services
at Paleik and Thamaing. These small mills had to rely on alternative
arrangements, not only to satisfy their own in-house requirements but also to
provide some finishing services to the larger spinning and weaving mills.
This situation was further aggravated since the commissioning of the Shwedaung
Spinning and Weaving Mill in 1982. Of the 24 small mills, 17 mills had to
maintain or develop their own finishing sections within their mills. By and
large, however, most of these mills had to rely on indigenous equipment which
were added to supplement miscellaneous pieces that were already available.
Nonetheless, in spite of all of these commendable efforts undertaken by TIC,
most of this equipment and machinery ended up being technically obsolete and
energy and chemically inefficient, with limited capabilities and very high
operating costs. Moreover, not all mills succeeded in having complete ranges
of finishing equipment within their mills, resulting in substantial inter-mill
movement of semi-finished fabrics. This also contributed to lack of control
over the complete finishing cycle, both in quality and processing cost (para
3.10). TIC is determined to replace almost all of these with more modern and
efficient capacities. However, the extent and timing of this replacement
depends on the financing available. The proposed Project, besides serving the
finishing requirement of the Shwedaung Spinning and Weaving Mill, will also
3/ The Paleik Textile Complex is located in Upper Burma (900 km from Rangoon)
and has been in operation since 1973. The Paleik Textile Complex is the
only one in Burma with industrial yarn dyeing facilities, and in 1980/81
produced some 3,200 tons of dyed yarn.

replace some of the small finishing units (para 4.10). Phased replacement at
this time is due to financing constraints. Details of the phasing will be
dealt with under the proposed Sector Study (para 3.07).
2.12      The total output of the textile sector (cotton textiles, printed
fabrics, and others) over the past decade has been erratic and varied from a
low of about 13 million kg (1974/75) to a high of about 26 million kg (in
1977/78). Annual figures, showing the share of TIC in total production are
presented in the following table:

2.13      These figures show, first, the high degree of variation in
production from year to year, primarily due to annual variations in domestic
cotton supply, and chronic but varying shortages of foreign exchange for the
import of fiber, yarns, dyes, chemicals and spare parts, and second, the level
of importance of TIC in the sector. The distribution of production between the
private sector and cooperatives, in terms of the number of looms and associated
production output, is difficult to specify since the inter-relationship between
the private and cooperative sector is fluid, and the process of joining, or
abdicating from the cooperative system is a continuous and voluntary activity.
Also, because of the intermittent usage of much of the capacity in the
cooperative sector, the overall capacity of the industry is difficult to
determine with any precision. In 1981, the Ministry of Cooperatives started an
extensive survey to update textile installed capacities and production; the
results are expected to be available early 1984.
III.   TEXTILE INDUSTRIES CORPORATION (TIC) - THE EXECUTING AGENCY
A. Background and Organization
3.01      The Project would be implemented and operated by the Textile
Industries Corporation (TIC), which is under the supervision of the Ministry
of No. 1 Industry. This Ministry is in charge of light industries such as



- 7 -
ceramics, and foodstuffs, while the Ministry of No. 2 Industry looks after
heavy industries such as petrochemicals, paper and heavy machinery.
3.02      TIC was formed in March 1972, as the successor to the Textile
Planning Committee and the Textile Industry Management Committee. TIC is a
corporate body, with headquarters in Rangoon, and with the right to acquire
and own property. Further, as a State Corporation, TIC is empowered (with
Government approval) to borrow and repay funds directly, both from external
sources and from within the country.
3.03      The Management Committee of TIC (equivalent to a Board of Directors)
is composed of ten members. Seven directors are appointed by the Ministry and
have full-time executive positions within the corporation, while the remaining
three are worker appointees (para 2.03). The Management Committee is headed
by a Chairman who is also the Managing Director of the Corporation, and is
directly responsible to one of the two Deputy Ministers in the Ministry. The
Managing Director is assisted by Directors of Planning, Production, Finance
and Administration.
3.04      TIC is currently responsible for managing the operations of 48
state-owned mills and factories, which manufacture woven apparel, household
fabrics and industrial/agricultural items such as rope, twine and jute bags.
These production units are currently grouped into three divisions, each headed
by a Director, as follows: Division I - Cotton Textiles, consisting of 9
relatively large mills, some of which are integrated; Division II - General
Textiles, consisting of 24 smaller (and generally older) mills; and Division
III - Jute Operations, consisting of 15 mills. The Government plans to
establish a separate jute corporation in the near future so that TIC will then
comprise just the operations of Divisions I and II.
3.05      At the mill level, the organizational structure is similar to that
of TIC headquarters (and to the structure applicable to all state-owned
industrial plants, as standardized by the Government). Each producing unit is
managed by a General Manager, and has four departments (Planning, Production,
Finance and Administration) each under a Manager. The Planning Department in
each mill is responsible for budget and material planning, procurement,
marketing, inventory control and training. The Production Department is
responsible for day-to-day manufacturing and processing, including quality
control and production record-keeping. The Finance Department is responsible
for all costing, payroll and internal audits. The Administration Department
is responsible for personnel functions, welfare, security and transport.
This organizational structure is considered satisfactory for the Project. TIC
is reasonably autonomous in day-to-day operational matters, but for the
formulation and planning of new projects, the Industrial Planning Department
(IPD) of the Ministry No. 1 Industry plays a primary role. The proposed
Project, for example, was formulated by IPD with close technical collaboration
and consultation with TIC's Planning Department.
3.06      TIC is a diverse and complex organization whicnr, given tne external
constraints imposed upon it, operates with an acceptable level of efficiency.
The Corporation has implemented several large textile projects in recent years
and has demonstrated that with appropriate external assistance and assistance
from other agencies in Burma, it is competent in this field. TIC possesses a
wide spectrum of managerial and technological Knowledge gainea from long



- 8 -
experience in the operation of cotton and jute mills. It has a pool of
management, engineering and accountiLng staff, some of whom will be assigned for
implementation of the proposed Project, as well as for operations after its
completion.
3.07      Since 1968, when a large part of the textile industry was
nationalized, TIC has undertaken a nmajor program of restructuring and
expansion in the textile industry. While some major problems have yet to be
addressed, progress in a number of areas has been noteworthy.  First, the 67
textile mills which were nationalized in 1968 (para 2.09), together with the
three state-owned mills which were in operation at that time, have been
reorganized into 48 mills through a process of regrouping machinery and
consolidation of management. Second, in order to ensure adequate supplies of
essential inputs, TIC has taken over the import of all textile raw materials
such as dyes, chemicals and yarns, and handles their distribution not only to
state sector mills but also to the private sector and cooperatives. Third,
the Corporation has initiated a program of expansion to meet increased demand
which has led to the establishment of new spinning and weaving plants,
diversification into knitting and garment activities, and finally,
rationalization and balancing with the establishment of the proposed finishing
plant. As part of the proposed Project, the Government will undertake a study
of all facets of the textile sector including: the detailed structure and
organization of the State cooperative and private sectors; the performance, both
current and historical, including aspects such as expansion and restructuring,
capacity utilization, productivity, product quality, raw material and energy
usage, and production costs and prices; pattern and level of investment markets
and marketing for textile products; structure and evaluation of clomestic
consumption and export; economic evaluation of domestic production versus
imports; assessment of the economics of specialization at the industry and mill
levels; economics of new capacity versus rehabilitation/modernization; training
and improving the productivity of all of TIC's mills, which would lead to an
action plan aimed at upgrading perfo;rmance and increasing capacity utilization,
specifically in TIC's major integratted mills. Agreement has been reached with
the Government on the objectives and the Terms of Reference of this study. The
Terms of Reference are presented in Annex 3-1. Moreover, the Government has
confirmed that the study will be carried out by December 31, 1985, and will be
made available, in a timely manner, to IDA for review and comment. The report
would include an action plan for the implementation of the recommendations
thereof.
B. Capacity Utilization
3.08      Capacity utilization in the textile industry was reviewed during
project preparation4/. In 1980/81 overall average yarn productio:n in all of
TIC mills was found to be about 57 kg per spindle. The average annual fabric
production per loom in the five major mills was about 13,600 meters, and in
smaller mills, about 7,000 meters.  Ihe overall average capacity utilization
was estimated to be only 40-50% in spinning, and 50-60% in weaving, based on
rough estimates of total installed equipment operating on three shifts per day
4/ Burma - Textile Sector Review and Finishing Plant Report (Gherzi Textile
Organization, dated June 1982). Contained in Project File, Item 1.



and achievable levels of operational efficiencies under Burmese conditions.
Capacity utilization is low for a variety of reasons. First, most plants are
run on a two-shift rather than a three-shift per day basis; according to TIC,
this is due to social reasons and also because of lack of spare parts.
Moreover, as of October 1982, TIC plants operate for only 240 days per year,
which also leads to low machine utilization and contributes to the low overall
capacity utilization of the sector.
3.09      Second, the capacity utilization of the sector is low due to low
labor productivity. This is because of excessive employment for social
reasons, lack of incentives and inadequate training. Low productivity is also
caused by production targets being set so low that they can easily be met.
Third, much of the equipment, particularly that which was assembled by TIC
after nationalization in 1968 into larger units, is obsolete and poorly
maintained--largely due to shortages or non-availability (no longer
manufactured) of spare parts. Fourth, raw materials are in short and erratic
supply. About 30% of cotton requirements, together with almost all dyes and
chemicals, must be imported. Annual allocations of foreign exchange for this
purpose vary from year to year, but available supplies are reportedly
inadequate to meet the demands of the sector. Fifth, recent capacity
additions in spinning and weaving have led to an imbalance in the industry.
For example, TIC's new Shwedaung Textile Mill has not been matched by a
corresponding investment in finishing capacity, and will not be able to
process properly some 6 million meters of its output because of a shortage of
modern finishing capacity in the country. Increased weaving output would
aggravate the existing shortage in finishing. In some of TIC's smaller and
older mills and in the private and cooperative sectors, this problem has been
partially addressed by the establishment of small finishing units in textile
plants. However, these units are inefficient, provide poor quality finishing
well below acceptable standards, consume inordinately high quantities of
chemicals and energy, and contribute materially to environmental pollution.
The proposed study by the Government (para 3.07) would specifically address
improving operations. Improved capacity utilization is being addressed under
the proposed Project (para 5.02) and the study would provide the needed
framework to improve productivity throughout other TIC mills and a program for
phasing out TIC's outmoded inefficient processing facilities.
C. Performance of Fabric Finishing Facilities at TIC's Small Mills
3.10      Nearly all of TIC's finishing facilities in the small mills are
considered obsolete and inefficient, with limited capabilities resulting in
high operating costs. In developed countries, equipment of more recent
technology than that of TIC's is being replaced on economic grounds. TIC has
long recognized the inefficiencies of these small units and is determined to
replace them with more modern efficient capacities (para 2.11). Comparison of
data obtained from TIC small mills (Annex 3-2) for the products to be
processed under the proposed Project with those of a modern and economic size
mill operating under Burmese conditions indicates that on average:
(i) Consumption of dyes and chemicals varies from 190% to 380% and
on average is about 280% higher in small mills than those in
the modern mill. This additional consumption of dyes and
chemicals amounts to about 0.78 kyats per linear meter.



- 10 -
Also, associated additional costs due to higher consumption of
water and fuel (steEm), which is proportional to the
consumption of dyes and chemicals, amounts to about 0.36 kyats
per linear meter;
(ii)  Indirect processing costs are about 15% higher in the small
finishing mills, compared to those of the modern mill. This
amounts to about 0.1 kyats per linear meter;
(iii)  Additional costs associated with the small mills is also
related to inter-mill transport of semi-finished fabric, higher
wqaste as a result of this transportation and higher inventory.
This is estimated to about 2% of the semi-finished fabric
average price, and amounts to about 0.1 kyats per linear meter;
and
(iv)  The quality of the product processed in modern finishing mills
is significantly superior to those processed in the small mills
and commands some 20% higher price. It is estimated that about
8% is due to sanforizing, about 10% to higher color application
and about 2% to improved final finish. This averages to about
2.1 kyats per linear meter.
The net benefit (in 1982 prices) accruing due to operating cost and the
selling price, amounts to about 3.44 kyats per linear meter (0.78 + 0.36 +
0.1+ 0.1 + 2.1 = 3.44). The net present value of these benefits and economic
costs of investment in a modern plant, discounted at 10%, is significantly
positive and hence justifying replacement of the TIC old small finishing mill
by a modern and economic size finishing facility. These benefits have been
incorporated as additional benefits attributed to the Project (para 7.10).
Less flexibility and high social cost of effluenl: (not quantified) are among
additional factors in favor of replacing the small inefficient facilities.
D. Pricing System
3.11      TIC's prices are set and administered by the Government.  Such
official prices, in general, are not related to international market prices
based on supply and demand but are determined on a cost-plus basis. By
contrast, private production and the resale of TIC's goods in the private
market, enjoy de-facto freedom from control, where commodities are traded at
free market prices5/. Because the Government is interested in keeping the
prices for all necessity items low, prices are set to allow cross,
subsidization from luxury to necessity items at the ex-factory wholesale
level.
3.12      The cost-plus pricing system should, at least in theory, allow for
full cost recovery including depreciation and a reasonable accumulation of
profits in proportion to the capital employed. In practice, price increases
5/ Since the costs of most supplies in the private and cooperative sectors
derive from TIC or Government controlled imports, this "freedom" is likely
to be upward only.



- 11 -
on strategically important materials may not be allowed, or may be delayed.
The jute division of TIC, for example, continuously shows an operating loss
and is, in effect, subsidized by the more profitable textile operations.
Conversely, price increases may be allowed to cover excessive costs, which
provides little incentive to inefficient producers to improve their
operations and may promote improper allocation of resources. Despite the
inadequacies of the present system, it is noteworthy that current prices for
most textile products are some 10-20% below present world prices6/ for
comparable commodities which, considering the generally inferior quality, is a
reasonably appropriate margin. The pricing system is discussed in more detail
in paras 4.14 - 4.19.
E. Financial Performance

3.14      The changing financial situation of the Corporation over the past
five years can clearly be seen from the above figures. Although total
revenues have generally been increasing at an average rate of about 9%
6/ The present world prices vary substantially, depending on quality and
sources of supply, e.g., prices for yarn and fabrics produced in the
Far East are some 20-30% lower than those in Europe and North America.



- 12 -
annually, costs have been increasing at a more rapid rate of about 13%
annually, which has eroded profit margins to almost nothing. This erosion is
caused, in part, by the pricing system which, in practice, permits increases
after some delay. For jute and some specific textile products (such as
fabrics used for school and other uniforms) the Government has been extremely
reluctant in increasing prices (para 3.11). Long-term debt has increased by
kyats 1,045 million (US$135 million equivalent) over the period as a result of
major investments in new projects (fixed assets increased by kyats 1,280
million over the same period--Annex 3-4). Although debt-service coverage,
debt:equity and current ratios are still reasonably satisfactory, a
continuation of these trends would quickly lead to an unsatisfactory financial
situation and TIC would not be able to expand further and modernize.
3.15      The major problem stems from the Jute Division of TIC.7/  When the
Textile Divisions are considered separately from jute, financial performance
is seen to be satisfactory, particularly following recently approved price
increases (about 8%) for most textile products (jute product prices were not
increased). Without jute operations, for the year ended March 31, 1982, the
profit margin for TIC would have been 1.9% instead of 0.3%. Moreover, 40% of
the outstanding loans and 60% of current debt-service, is associated with jute
operations.
3.16    A number of alternative measures could be taken to improve TIC's
financial performance:
(i)  All TIC prices could be increased by an additional 5% which would
be sufficient to bring financial ratios and cash flows to
acceptable levels. However, there is no real justification for
increasing textile prices to subsidize further losses from the
jute operations;
(ii) Alternatively, prices of jute products alone could lbe increased
by 10-12%, which would also be adequate to improve civerall
financial performance of TIC to an acceptable level.  However,
because of the strategic importance of jute for packaging rice,
both for export and the domestic market, the Governmlent is
reluctant to increase jute prices;
(iii) TIC could be strengthened by the infusion of more equity capital
from the Government. This is not seriously being considered
because it is in direct contradiction to Government policy
towards SEE's (para 2.03); or
(iv)  Jute operations could be separated from textile operations, and a
separate Jute Corporation formed. Wlile not directly addressing
the necessity for a structural adjust-ment, this solution would
contain the problem within the jute division without damaging the
otherwise financially healthy textile divisions.
7/ In 1976, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) extended a loan of US$25.3 million
to TIC for the establishment of a new Jute Mill Project in Burma. According
to TIC, the Jute Mill Project was implemented satisfactorily as scheduled,
and is operating as planned.  However, there are problems witlh jute supply,
low capacity utilization, and low jute product prices.



- 13 -
3.17      In fact, the Government plans to take steps to form a separate Jute
Corporation. In September 1983, the Council of Ministers (the Cabinet)
approved a comprehensive proposal of the Ministry of No. I Industry to
separate TIC's textile and jute operations and establish a separate Jute
Industries Corporation to take over the latter. The Council of Ministers has
submitted this proposal to the Council of State, which is the highest state
authority in Burma, and it is expected that the proposal will be approved by
the Council of State in the near future. The Minister of the Ministry of No.
1 Industry, through a letter to the Association, has confirmed the action
taken by his Ministry and the current status of the Ministry's proposal. The
Association is satisifed that TIC and the Ministry of No. 1 Industry are
committed to such proposal and have taken all steps within their competence to
achieve it. In anticipation of favorable consideration by the Council of
State, the Ministry has prepared a manning plan for the new Corporation. As a
result, agreement has been reached with the Government that it will review
with the Association, by the end of May 1984, the then current status of the
organizational changes in the textile sector insofar as these would affect
TIC's current jute operations. Also, agreement has been reached with the
Government that it will cause TIC to maintain separate financial accounts and
separate financial reports, starting from April 1, 1984 until such time as
TIC's jute operations are transferred to a new jute corporation. Under these
circumstances, and as detailed in Chapter VII, projections of the future
financial performance of TIC (i.e., the Textile Divisions) show a satisfactory
financial performance and indicate that the restructured TIC will be able to
absorb the additional obligations associated with implementation of the
proposed Project without undue financial strain.
IV.   MARKET AND MARKETING
A. Past Production and Consumption of Textiles
4.01      Domestic production during 1971-81 fluctuated erratically, primarily
due to a lack of foreign exchange for import of fiber, yarn, dyes, chemicals
and spare parts. Foreign exchange shortages also led to purchases being made
from a variety of sources, depending on the availability of credit and
sometimes with little consideration to appropriate quality. Textile imports,
like all other imports to the country, are limited and controlled by the
Government through the allocation of foreign exchange. Import duties levied
on textile and its ancillary products range between 5% for staple fiber to 25%
on polyester cotton blended yarn. On top of which Commodities and Service Tax
(CST) is added, ranging from 0% for staple fiber to 20% for polyester cotton
blended yarn. The estimate of the actual consumption based on imports and
locally-produced textiles for 1971-81 are as follows:

cooperative and private sectors.
c/  Yarn imports have been excluded to avoid double counting, since they are
included in domestic fabric production.
d/  Up to and including 1978-79, the figures for imports are calendar years
while production figures refer to financial years.
4.02      During 1971-81, mainly as a result of factors stated in para 4.01,
total apparent textile consumption declined from about 31 million kg
(equivalent to about 187 million m2) in 1971/72, to about 16 million kg (about
96 million m2) in 1974/75. Subsequent consumption has been at about 21 to 30
million kg (127-180 million m2) annually. On a per capita basis, apparent
consumption dropped from 1.1 kg in 1971/72, to about 0.54 kg in 1974/75 and
has fluctuated in the range of 0.6 kg to 0.9 kg per capita since that time.
B. Current Estimate of Demand for Textiles
4.03      This erratic pattern of past recorded consumption is of limited use
in determining actual current demand. The figures do suggest, however, that
there is a considerable unsatisfied demand for textiles, and it is necessary
to try to quantify current demand in order to provide a reasonable basis for
projecting future requirements.
4.04      For the period 1971-1973, recorded annual per capita consumption of
textiles averaged about 0.96 kg. Supply and demand were reported to be more
or less in balance at that time.  From 1970-1981, per capita income grew at



- 15 -
about 2% annually.  Assuming an average demand-income elasticity of 0.9,8/
per capita textile demand in 1980/81 would be 1.11 kg. Total demand would
thus be about 38 million kg, compared with recorded consumption of 26 million
kg. The difference of 12 million kg is one estimate of apparently unsatisfied
demand in 1980/81, although there are indications that at least some part of
this demand is being met by unrecorded production and imports.
4.05      A similar figure of textile demand was reported in a household
survey undertaken by the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) in 1977. This
survey suggested an annual per capita demand of about 1.1 kg, while recorded
consumption in that year was 0.96 kg. Allowing for normal growth in demand
since 1977, these figures suggest that unsatisfied demand in 1980/81 is of the
order of 14 million kg. The existence of unsatisfied textile demand (or
unrecorded consumption) in Burma is also supported by international
comparisons as illustrated in the following table:

a/ Source: Gherzi Textile Organization
4.06      There is no obvious reason why textile consumption in Burma should
be so substantially below the figures recorded in neighboring countries, with
generally similar climate, income and cultural patterns. In the absence of
any additional information concerning unrecorded production, and imports, a
figure of 1.1 kg per capita in 1980/81 is a reasonable and conservative basis
for projecting future supply and demand balances in the organized textile
sector. The proposed study by the Government (para 3.07) would address future
sector development including a more thorough assessment of textile demand.
C. Future Supply and Demand for Textiles
4.07      Based on the above estimated current demand of 1.1 kg per capita,
assuming that population and per capita income will continue to grow at 2.2%
and 2% annually, respectively (the levels actually experienced from
8/ For India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, the elasticity of demand for cotton
textile ranges between 0.4 and 0.5, and the elasticity of demand for
man-made fiber ranges between 3.2 and 4.1. (Source: Gherzi Textile
Organization of Switzerland). For Burma, which is similar to India,
Bangladesh, and Pakistan in income level, climatic conditions and cultural
patterns, it is assumed that the elasticity of demand for cotton textile
is 0.45 and for man-made fiber is 3.6. Assuming the composition of
Burma's fiber consumption in 1980/81 was 13% man-made and 87% cotton, the
weighted average of elasticity of demand for textiles in Burma would be
about 0.9.

1970-1981), three demand forecasts laave been prepared by the Consultants
assuming different demand elasticities for cotton and man-made fibers within
the range of elasticities experienced in comparable countries. The results of
the projections based on these assumptions are summarized in the following
table:

a/  Based on 87% cotton and 13% man-made fibers in 1980/81.
4.08      Based on these projections, ranges of the total demand figures for
both cotton and man-made textiles can be derived:
Burma - Projected Textile Demand
(million kg)
Recorded Consumption         Estimated Demand
1980/81           1980/81   1985/86   1990/91
Cotton Fibers                       22.9                33      38-40      43-46
Man-made Fibers                       3.4                5       7-1)       8-16
Total                            26.3                38     45-50      51-62
Percent man-made in total           13%                 13%    16-20%    16-26%
These projections indicate that unless there are substantial additions to
domestic production capacity and imports of man-made fibers, the current
apparent supply deficit of some 12 million kg will grow substantially over the
coming decade.
4.09      Although the proposed Project would not directly add to textile
production capacity in Burma, it will, as discussed in para 3.09, allow the
more productive use of existing capacity by some 6 million meters. Total
Project output is equivalent to 3 mi:Llion kg, or only about 25% of the
currently unsatisfied demand for textiles. Under these circumstances, there
would appear to be little difficulty in marketing this incremental finished
production.

D. Supply and Demand for Fabric Finishing Capacity
4.10       In the establishment of textile spinning and weaving capacity, TIC's
past practice has been that approximately one-half of the yarn produced is to
be used by a mill for its own weaving production and the remaining one-half
sold out mainly to the cooperative and private sectors, which will further use
the yarn to produce textiles of their choice. Within TIC as a whole, about
10% of the spun yarn is used for color woven fabrics (longies, towels, and
blankets) and the remaining 90%, which constitutes about 45% of the total spun
yarn, is used for production of grey fabrics. During 1978-1982, production of
grey fabrics in TIC, on an average, amounted to about 45.6 mlm, and about 43.5
mlm was processed in TIC's finishing facilities (para 2.11). The practice in
the development of finishing capacity has been less organized as discussed in
para 2.11, and generally the availability of quality finishing facilities is
very inadequate. Details on grey fabric supply and the supply/demand
situation of fabric finishing capacities are shown in Annex 4-1 and are
summarized below:

d/ This is a theoretical gap since an equal amount is being sold as grey fabric.
The above figures show a current finishing gap of about 2.1 mlm. But in fact,
this can be considered as a theoretical gap since an equivalent amount is
being sold as grey fabric in the consumer market at a small profit margin. By
1984/85, when the Shwedaung Spinning and Weaving Mill reaches its full planned
capacity, this gap would increase to about 7.7 mlm. This latter level
includes the existing small finishing facilities of 25.9 mlm. As far as
modern finishing capacities are concerned, the gap could be considered to be
as high as 31.5 mlm (7.7 + 25.9 - 2.1 = 31.5) if all small and inefficient
facilities were to be closed and the current level of 2.1 mlm of grey fabric
sold in the consumer market. It is expected that the market would not be
receptive to incremental grey fabric above the current level of 2.1 mlm, even
at unfavorable terms to TIC. This could result in curtailing weaving

production and abrogating the intended efforts (under the proposed study--para
3.07) to improve spinning and weaving productivity until an additional
finishing facility becomes available. The proposed Project which is expected
to start in 1987/88 and reach full planned capacity by 1989/90, will address
the finishing requirement for the additional grey fabric output,, as well as
replacing some of the most inefficient finishing facilities in TIC's small
mills (para 2.11). As a result, the finishing capacity of the small mills
will be reduced from the current figure of about 25.9 mlm to about 14.9 mlm in
1989/90. This replacement represents about 42% of existing small mills fabric
finishing capacity. As a result of the closing of the small finishing
facilities, some 300 workers (less than 1% of TIC's labor force) would be
affected. These workers would be a'bsorbed at existing TIC operations. The
proposed study would develop a more detailed phased plan for the eventual
replacement of the remaining obsolete fabric finishing facilities.
E. Marketing and Distribution System for Textiles
4.11       The marketing and distribution of textiles in Burma varies
according to the ownership of the producing facilities. In the public sector,
until 1981, TIC acted solely as a manufacturer, while the Textile Trade
Corporation (TTC), a public sector corporation, undertook the marketing and
distribution. Furthermore, TTC acted as a main distributor of imported raw
materials such as grey yarn or dyes and chemicals for the cooperative and
private sectors. In the cooperative! sector, with the exception of a few
producers' societies, raw materials were redistributed to private individual
weavers or converters for finishing on a commissioning basis. Finished
textile goods were then resold to cooperatives through various distribution
channels. Private sector manufacturers continue to have free access to the
wholesale or retail selling of finished products. Thus, the market structure
and pricing for both the cooperative and private sectors more or less obey the
basic laws of supply and demand, and these producers can search out their own
markets, and fix selling prices as they wish (para 3.11).
4.12       Beginning in 1981, TIC has taken over from TTC the role of
procurement of imported raw materials such as yarns, dyes and chemicals, and
the distribution of these items (as well as locally-produced TIC textile
materials such as dyed yarn) to cooperatives and to the private sector.
4.13       TIC produces a wide range of textile articles and there are a total
of about 30 different groups of textile products. TIC's total sales in
1981/82 amounted to 1,594 million kyats: approximately 20-30% to Government
departments; 15-20% to wholesale and retail cooperatives; 5-10% to various
trade corporations; and the balance of about 40-50% to public and private
sector consumers.
4.14       Although prices for the textile products from the private sector
and cooperatives are set more or less freely as described in para 3.11, those
of TIC (as for most SEEs) are closely controlled. The pricing system for TIC
operations, as a whole, has been established to achieve reasonable returns for
the Corporation. But the application of the principle varies considerably
from product to product to allow cross-subsidization from luxuries to
necessities, in pursuit of the social objective of a more uniform income
distribution.



- 19 -
4.15       In practice, wholesale prices for domestically produced industrial
goods (including textiles) are fixed on the basis of average costs calculated
for individual items to establish the price for that item for all producers.
Costs used in the calculation include all direct costs such as raw materials,
labor, utilities and maintenance, together with various overhead expenses,
depreciation and financial charges. To the total cost developed in this way a
profit margin is added, ranging, in the case of textiles, from about 5% to 20%
of costs, with the lower margins normally applied to the more essential
commodities (i.e. jute). To the resultant ex-factory price a Commodities and
Service Tax (CST)9/ (para 4.01) is added to arrive at the wholesale price.
4.16       Applications for price increases based on costs are prepared by TIC
at intervals of not less than six months, and submitted to the Ministry of
No.1 Industry for clearance before being sent through the Ministry of Finance
and Planning to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) for approval. This
committee judges whether a price increase is appropriate, including an
examination of the cost increases included in the application. Price
adjustments sought on the basis of changes in the costs of imported raw
materials are generally allowed. However, increases in domestic overhead
expenses are usually not. The proposed profit margin is also closely
scrutinized taking into account the nature of the product.
4.17       Although prices are established for each product no matter in which
TIC plant it is produced, considerable latitude is allowed in the
differentiation of products to take into account differences in the quality of
products which are otherwise similar. The proposed new finishing plant, which
could produce textile commodities of qualities not currently produced in Burma
(fabrics would be pre-shrunk, for example), would thus establish its own
domestic price list based on its own cost structure. Based on the methodology
currently used to set textile prices, the following price list has been
developed for the five fabric qualities to be produced by the Project. A
constant profit margin of 10% has been used for this calculation and the
resulting ex-factory prices have been used for financial analysis of the
Project contained in this report.
4.18      Prices developed in this way by TIC compare with 1982 third quarter
average border pricesl/ for comparable fabrics of the product mix are shown
below:
9/  In general, CST is an ad valorem tax which also functions as a tax to
implement the cross-subsidization policies of the Government (para 3.11).
For textile fabrics, it ranges from 5% for cotton drills and cotton
cellulars to 40% for polyester cotton blended fabrics.

processing margin of US$0.76 per linear meter orn the basis of average border
prices, but in line with the nominal processing margin assumed iLn other Bank
studies, and more conservative than the Consultant's estimate. The Project's
nominal processing margin in financial terms, in effect, is set by the
Government.   The Government has agreed that it will cause TIC to establish
prices for project output based on the project cost structure to enable, under
conditions of efficient operationll/, the Project to earn a reasonable return
on invested capital. Furthermore, the Government has agreed not to take nor
cause to be taken any action which, assuming production under conditions of
efficient operation, would prevent TIC from earning a reasonable rate of return
on invested capital with respect to the Project.
V.    THE PROJECT
A.   Project Scope, Location and Product Mix
5.01      The Project will include fabric finishing facilities to produce
about 16.6 million linear meters (mLm) of 100% cotton and cotton polyester
blended fabrics of medium quality for shirting and suiting. The Project will
help expand the country's limited modern capacity to process (bleach, dye or
print) fabrics from about 18 mlm to 35 mlm, while partially replace the
11/ At targeted operational efficiencies (para 5.02).

existing obsolete and uneconomical finishing facilities in some of the small
weaving plants. The Project size and configuration was decided after taking
into account the demand for fabric and after studying various alternatives of
possible expansion/rehabilitation of existing major facilities and economies
of scale. Two locations were considered for the Project, namely Pegu,
approximately 70 km northeast of Rangoon, and Shwedaung, approximately 225 km
northwest of Rangoon. After detailed analysis of cost and benefits,
Shwedaung, a town with a population of some 50,000 was selected by TIC and the
Government as the most suitable site. Shwedaung is well connected by a river
(the Irrawaddy), roads and rail transportation. Furthermore, it is centrally
located to serve the existing textile mills in lower Burma, and also with
respect to major market areas. The selected site for the Project covers an
area of 16 hectares and is adjacent to the newly commissioned (April 1982)
spinning and weaving mill which was built and financed with assistance from
the People's Republic of China. The site includes ample space for possible
future expansion.
5.02      The Project will include modern fabric bleaching, dyeing, printing,
and finishing facilities with modern devices to ensure product quality. The
mill will run 7,080 working hours per year and at an operating efficiency of
about 70%. TIC's operational practice has been to run its mills for two
shifts of eight hours on 240 days a year, that is 3,840 working hours a year.
Because finishing operations are capital intensive, the Project could only be
financially and economically justifiable with the proposed higher level of
capacity utilization. Agreement has been reached with the Government that it
will cause TIC to operate the Project (plant) for at least 7,080 hours per
year (295 working days per year in three shifts per day of eight hours each).
As is normal for textile finishing mills, the facilities will have a surplus
capacity of about 15% to take care of unavoidable production peaks, changes in
demands, reprocessing and sampling needs.
5.03      The product mix of the Project, which is based on data provided by
TIC and the market study prepared by the Consultants, and reviewed and
accepted by the Bank, will include the following:

B.   Project Technology
5.04      The various technologies available have been examined in detail
before recommending the appropriate technology for Burmese conditions. For
the fabric processing facilities, the latest technology will be used to ensure
product quality and also to economize on the use of water, fuel, dye stuff and
chemicals. The use of this technology is not oriented towards saving labor.
The Burmese have demonstrated their capabilities to operate successfully
similar equipment installed in the Paleik Textile Complex in Mandalay.
C.   Buildings
5.05      A covered floor space of about 20,000 m2 will be provided to house
the new facilities, including about 7,200 m2 for offices, stores and social
facilities. Additional space in the plant layout is provided for a possible
second phase (yarn conversion and processing facilities) as well as for
possible future expansion. The main factory buildings will be of structural
steel on reinforced concrete foundations. The roof construction will consist
of galvanized steel frames cladded with corrugated aluminum sheets.
Administration and social buildings will be in masonry and reinforced
concrete. All floor surfaces will be cement finished except for parts of the
processing department where Terrazzo tiles would be installed.
D.   Raw Materials and Utilities
5.06      The basic raw materials required by the Project are grey 100% cotton
and cotton polyester blended fabrics which will mnainly be obtained from other
TIC mills (Shwedaung, Meiktila, Thamaing and other smaller mills in the
Rangoon area). At maximum planned output, the Project will require about 18
mlm of grey fabrics per year. Practically all dye stuffs and chemicals
required for processing will be imported. The Government has agreed that it
will make satisfactory arrangements for the timeLy procurement of dyes,
chemicals, spare parts and other maintenance materials for the operation of
the Project.
5.07      The water requirement for the Project is estimated at 95 cubic
meters per hour, and will be obtained from the Irrawaddy river to the plant
site, a distance of about 5 km. Water intake pumps and facilities will be
installed at the water supply point. The water required for dyeing, boiler
feed and drinking purposes will be treated in a water treatment unit adjacent
to the river before being pumped to the plant site. Steam required for
production in the processing departments will be generated by two package
boilers, each with a capacity of ten tons per hour.
5.08      The electric power requirements for the Project are estimated at
about 1.2 MW, and will be supplied by the Electric Power Corporation, which is
the Government entity responsible for all power supply and distribution in the
country, and which will undertake the construction of the power transmission
lines up to the receiving substation at the plant site. No difficulties at
the present time are anticipated in meeting the project power requirements,
particularly after the recent addition of 2 gas turbines, 18 MW each, at Prome
which is only 6 km away from Shwedaung. The Government has agreed that it
will take appropriate measures to ensure that adequate power is supplied in



- 23 -
time for the Project. Diesel generators will also be installed for emergency
power supply and will be financed under the Project.
E.   Housing
5.09      Under the Project, provision is made for housing facilities for
management, supervisory and other essential staff who need to be on short
calls in case of emergency. Eleven single-family houses for top management,
30 buildings of the duplex type for supervisory and technical staff, and 60
units as dormitories for single workers will be built under the Project at a
cost of about US$1.5 million. The site of these housing facilities will be
within the residential area previously allocated for the textile workers.
Part of this area has already been utilized for the staff housing of the newly
established spinning and weaving mill. These facilities will be within
walking distance of the project site.
F.   Environmental Considerations
5.10      The air quality of Shwedaung is relatively good because there are
few industrial establishments in the area at present. The plant site is at a
distance of 5 km from the outskirts of the city. Although there are no
Burmese standards for pollution control, provision has been made to keep the
discharge of liquid and gaseous waste within acceptable limits and Bank
guidelines for limits on these wastes (gaseous and liquid) will be followed.
The steam boilers will be equipped with automatic regulating devices to ensure
maximum combustion and to control the discharge of carbon monoxide in the flue
gases. Full ventilation will be provided in the fabric processing area, but
without air recycling, and equipment generating steam or heat will have
special hoods with forced exhaust systems. The effluent from the processing
departments will be treated in an industrial waste treatment plant near the
project site before being discharged into the river. The design of the main
buildings and the type of equipment used would not allow the noise level to
exceed 90 decibels. Fire protection will include hydrant network and fire
extinguishers. The above environmental facilities were discussed with TIC.
The Government has agreed to cause TIC to ensure that the plant shall be
designed and installed, and thereafter maintained and operated, in accordance
with standards for environmental controls established in guidelines
satisfactory to the Borrower and the Association.
G.   Project Implementation
5.11      Project implementation covers about 3-1/2 years of construction
followed by about two years production build-up period. Project management
will be the responsibility of TIC. For this project, a "Project Office" will
be formed consisting of the Project Director, Project Manager, and Project
Engineer, all under the overall supervision of TIC's Managing Director. The
Project Director will be a person with industrial experience, as well as
substantial experience in dealing with local authorities. The Project Manager
will be a senior engineer with 10-15 years of technological experience in
textiles as well as some experience in project implementation. The Project
Engineer will assist the Project Manager particularly in the area of plant
infrastructure and services, and will also closely coordinate with a full-time
staff member of the Construction Corporation (CC) which will be in charge of
all construction works. The Project Office will also include a Project



- 24 -
Accountant. The Project Office will initially be located at TIC headquarters
in Rangoon, and will be moved to the field locat:ion in Shwedaung when
construction begins. Additionally, the Project Office will make use of the
services of TIC staff in such areas as procurement, storage, custom clearance,
transport, but not on a full-time basis.  The Project Office has been formed.
The Project Director and Project MarLager have been appointed. The Project
Office will be assisted by a Project Engineering Firm (PEF) which will be
appointed after consultation with the Bank according to Terms of Reference
which have already been agreed (Project File, Item 3). PEF assistance during
implementation will include project design, engineering and advising/assisting
TIC in installation, training of personnel, start-up and commissioning of the
Project. It is estimated that 93 man-months of PEF services will be required
at a cost of US$0.93 million. Appointment of the PEF is expected by mid April
1984, and would be a condition for credit effecti'veness. The Government has
agreed to cause TIC to employ and retain a qualif-ied Project Engineering Firm
on a satisfactory basis until project completion, and that any modification or
termination of that contract will be decided only after consultation with
IDA. In addition, the Government has agreed to c:ause TIC not to invest in new
projects in excess of US$10 million equivalent before completion of the
Textile Finishing Plant Project without prior consultation with 'IDA. Further,
since construction would be the responsibility of the Construction Corporation
and it is critical to an efficient project implementation, the Government has
assured that all local construction materials will be supplied, as needed, for
the timely construction of the Project. The project implementation schedule
is given in Annex 5-1.
H.   Staffing and Training
5.12       At full capacity the Project would require about 470 workers for
three-shift operation. Upon project's physical completion, the Project Office
team (para 5.11), namely the Project Director, Manager and Engineer, will
assume the responsibilities as mill General Manager, Deputy General Manager
for Operations, and Assistant General Manager for mechanical and electrical
works. Other top management positions and some middle management, foreman and
skilled labor are likely to be drawn from the existing finishing plants with
supplemental training abroad.
5.13       Recruitment of operational management and staff will take place
during construction. A specific training plan will be prepared by TIC with
the assistance of the PEF, and will 'be submitted to the Bank for review by
December 1984. This was confirmed duiring negotiations. A small training unit
will be established at the plant site for initial orientation of operators and
maintenance personnel required for the production and services facilities.
After initial orientation, operators will be trained on the job, while
maintenance personnel will be trained during erection and commissioning of the
new equipment by suppliers' specialists. In addition, some 29 persons for
management, engineering and supervis:ion, will be trained abroad for periods
varying from 3 to 12 months.  The total cost of training is estimated at about
US$0.4 million. Foreign training would be coordinated in such a way that
trained personnel will be available at the erection and start-up period, and
will have the opportunity to gain practical experience while working with
expatriate specialists of the PEF who will provide training and commissioning
services, and assist in the initial operation of the mill. It is envisaged



- 25 -
that the services of at least five technologists (in bleaching, dyeing,
printing, finishing and quality control), four technicians (in mechanical,
electrical, control and services), and two specialists in financial and
management assistance, will be required for a period of 6-12 months. For
these services about 120 man-months of technical assistance will be provided
at a cost of about US$1.2 million. The total cost of all consultancy
services, including project design, engineering and commissioning services (93
+ 120 man-months) are estimated to be US$2.1 million at an average cost of
US$10,000 per man-month, including travel and lodging expenses. The
Government has agreed to cause TIC to ensure that the selection and terms and
conditions of employment of Consultants would be satisfactory to IDA.
VI.   PROJECT COST AND FINANCING PLAN AND PROCURENENT
A.   Project Cost
6.01      The total financing required for the Project, including working
capital and interest during construction, is estimated at US$65.0 million
equivalent. Of the total, US$29.7 million equivalent (about 46%) is in
foreign exchange. The cost estimate is presented in detail in Annex 6-1 and
is summarized on the following page.
6.02      The above cost estimates are based on data prepared by TIC and
Consultants, using end 1982 prices, and after detailed assessment of machinery
and civil works requirements, local conditions of civil works and erection and
requirements of technical assistance and training. The cost estimates for
machinery were reviewed in light of recent Bank experience on similar
equipment and were found satisfactory. The investment cost of this project is
somewhat higher than standard processing projects of the same production
capacity in other developing countries because: (i) the estimate includes
provision for services and infrastructure which will be required in a
possible second phase12/ which, for technical and economic reasons, could not
be separated from those under the Project. These provisions represent about
6.5% of installed cost; (ii) the lack of sufficiently trained manpower in
Burma necessitates reliance on expatriate assistance for project
implementation and initial operation; (iii) there is a need for local as well
as overseas training for personnel for positions in production, maintenance
and finance; and (iv) housing is required as detailed in para 5.09. Physical
contingencies of 10% of the Base Cost Estimate (BCE) on civil works and
equipment are provided for. Price contingencies for foreign expenditure are
assumed at 8% in 1983, 7.5% in 1984, 7% in 1985 and 6% in 1986 onward. For
local expenditures annual price increases are assumed at 4% in 1983 and
thereafter. In total, price contingencies represent 15% of the BCE.
6.03      Incremental working capital requirements for the Project are
estimated at kyats 23 million (US$3.0 million equivalent), excluding the cost
of spares which is included under equipment cost. These requirements have
been calculated based on the levels of inventories of raw materials,
12/ The second phase would include yarn dyeing and conversion and related
service facilities. TIC intends to implement the second phase when
financing is available.

semi-finished products and finished products as shown in Annex 6-2. The
working capital requirements are higher than those required for regular
commission processing facilities, mainly due to the necessity of keeping
fabric inventory which the mill has to buy or market, and which accounts for
80% of the total working capital.
B. Financing Plan
6.04      The following financing plan has been developed jointly with TIC and
the Government of Burma:

a/ Columns may not add due to rounding.
6.05      TIC's direct contribution would amount to approximately US$5.3
million equivalent. In keeping with normal procedures for financing projects
of this type in Burma, the Government's contribution of US$30.0 million
(equivalent to about 46% of the total financing required) would be in the form
of a long-term loan, bearing interest at 5% per annum. Repayment would be
over a period of 10 years following a five-year grace period. While this
means, in effect, that the Project is being financed almost completely by
loans, TIC's Textile Divisions'13/ overall debt load is such (as shown in
Chapter VII), that acceptable debt:equity and debt service coverage ratios for
the Corporation as a whole are maintained. This financing plan is therefore
satisfactory. Assurance has been obtained from the Government that it will
meet and will cause TIC to meet its respective financing obligations to the
13/ N4ote that references to TIC in Chapters VI, VII, VIII are to the Textile
Divisions of TIC only (para 3.16).



- 28 -
Project in a timely manner. Further, the Government has agreed that it will
make available any additional funds which may be required to complete the
Project under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The Project shall be
considered to be completed after the plant has been operated in two shifts at
an average of not less than 60% of its rated capacity for three consecutive
months.
6.06      The proposed IDA Credit of US$29.7 million (about 46% of the total
finance required) would be made to the Government on normal IDA terms. All
the proceeds of the Credit would be on-lent to TIC as a loan for a period of
15 years, including 5 years grace at an interest rate of 8.5% per annum under
a Subsidiary Loan Agreement. This on-lending rate is in line with the cost of
funds available in Burma to commercially oriented enterprises from the State
Development Bank. Moreover, Burma's domestic inflation rate has averaged 3%
annually over the past five years and it is anticipated to continue at 3-4%
annually for the foreseeable future, and consequently, the on-lending rate of
8.5% per annum corresponds to a real interest rate of about 5% per annum. The
foreign exchange risk would be borne by TIC. The signing of the Subsidiary
Loan Agreement, under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, would be a
condition of effectiveness for the proposed IDA Credit.
C. Procurement and Disbursement
6.07      All machinery, equipment, and spares with the exception of locally
manufactured transport equipment, will be financed by the proposed IDA
Credit. Since there are no local companies that manufacture textile
machinery, no local bids are expected. Goods and services financed by IDA
will be procured through procedures consistent with "Guidelines for
Procurement under World Bank Loans andl IDA Credits", dated March 1977.
International Competitive Bidding will be used except for (i) items costing
less than US$100,000 equivalent, but not exceeding the aggregate amount of
US$2 million, which may be procured by limited international tendering (after
having invited offers from suppliers in at least three eligible countries on
the basis of suitability, availability and price consideration) following IDA
approval of the proposed list of items involved; and (ii) proprietary items
and items in limited supply which are critical to the timely completion of the
Project and whose aggregate cost is estimated not to exceed US$1.5 million,
which may be procured following prudent shopping with prior IDA approval.
6.08      Civil works will be financecd by the Government and will be
implemented by the Construction Corporation (CC), the Government entity which
is responsible for all major permanent: construction works in the country
including industrial and commercial buildings, storage and social facilities,
housing, infrastructure and maintenance work. Conitracts with the CC are
usually on a cost-plus basis. Since civil works are critical to an efficient
project implementation, the Government has agreed that it will cause TIC to
enter into a contractual agreement with CC on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA, and furnish to IDA by September 30 of each year,
commencing on September 30, 1984, proposed financial and works plans and a
plan for the provision of locally available construction materials to meet the
requirement of the civil works contract for its review and comments. However,
about 40% of civil works representing the cost of imported construction



- 29 -
materials, such as prefabricated steel structures, reinforcing bars,
corrugated aluminum sheets, steel windows and doors, and pipes will be
financed with IDA funds and will be procured by TIC according to Bank
guidelines.
6.09      Imported raw materials such as dyes and chemicals which would be
financed by IDA, will also be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines.
6.10      The proposed allocation of IDA funds is shown below:
Proposed Allocation of IDA Funds
US$ million a/
1.   Equipment & Spares, and Erection Services                      19.1

a/   All disbursements will be made against 100% of foreign expenditures.
The schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Annex 6-3.  This schedule
is in line with the Bank's experience in other countries but is shorter than
the disbursement profile of previous Bank loans to Burma mainly because most
IDA operations in Burma have been for agriculture and infrastructure projects
which normally have a longer implementation period. The closing date of the
proposed IDA Credit will be December 31, 1988.
VII.   FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Basis of Projections
7.01      The assumptions used for projecting cost and revenue streams for the
Project are detailed in Annex 7-1 and discussed in the following paragraphs.
All financial projections have been made in current prices through FY 1987/88,
the first year of production, and in constant 1987 prices thereafter.
Projected rates of inflation for domestic and foreign prices are as shown in
para 6.02.
B. Production and Sales Volume and Revenues
7.02      At full normal production, the Project would process about 16.6
million linear meters of 100% cotton and cotton polyester-blended fabrics.
As noted in para 5.02, this level of output has been determined based on



- 30 -
anticipated operating efficiency and 7,080 working hours per year. Based on
the project implementation schedule (para 5.11), it has been assumed that
operations would commence on a singLe-shift basis in July 1987. A second and
third shift would be added in September 1987 and November 1988, respectively.
Thus, production build-up for the financial years ending March 31, would
therefore be 44% in 1987/88, 80% in 1988/89 and 100% of the planned outputl4/
in 1989/90 and thereafter.
7.03      Prices for each variety of fabric, developed as discussed in Chapter
IV, are shown in Annex 7-2. Anticipated production and sales volume, for the
first five years of operation during which steady-state production is reached,
are shown in Annex 7-3, where annual sales revenues by variety and in total
are also shown.
C. Production Costs
7.04      Production costs have beerL projected based on the TIC and Consultant
estimates, which have been reviewed and modified by the Bank. Exclusive of
depreciation and financial charges, the principal cost components are grey
fabric (80.3%), and dyes and other chemicals (6.4%). All other costs account
in total for only 13.3% of direct costs. Annual costs (in 1982 prices) at
full production are summarized below, with further detail in Anneax 7-4.

7.06      The above projections, which assume prices determined on the basis
of cost plus a 10% profit margin (para 4.17), show that the Project will
generate a satisfactory profit by the third year of operation. However, since
the Project has implications for many other operations of TIC, both as a
consumer of grey fabrics and in the displacement of some operations, the only
satisfactory way to assess properly the financial performance of the Project
is to integrate these revenue and cost streams into the projected overall
accounts of TIC, making adjustments for all relevant factors. Further
financial analysis has thus been carried out by analyzing the performance of
TIC, with and without the Project, as discussed below.
E. Financial Projections for TIC
1. Historical Performance
7.07      The financial performance of TIC over the past five years has been
discussed in Chapter III. There, it was concluded that although the financial
position of the Corporation is reasonably satisfactory (in terms of debt
service coverage, and the debt:equity and current ratios), profit margins have
been deteriorating, primarily because of the fixed price regime (particularly
in jute operations), and the slowness of the pricing authorities to react to
increases in the prices of inputs. However, as noted in para 3.17, the
Government plans to separate jute processing from the textile operations.
This would considerably reduce the debt-service burden and improve the
profitability of the remaining Textile Divisions. Also, as noted in para
3.15, the Government has recently approved price increases for a number of
important textile products and future levels of profitability should further
improve over those achieved in the past.
2. Future Performance of TIC's Textile Divisions without the Project
7.08      Financial projections showing the future performance of TIC's
Textile Divisions without the proposed finishing project have been prepared
based on the following assumptions:



- 32 -
(i) Jute operations have 'been excluded;
(ii) Revenues will continue to increase over the next four years as
production facilities already under construction are brought
on-stream and reach continuous and stable production;
(iii) Production costs will increase commensurately as projected by
TIC;
(iv) Administration and selling expenses will stabilize at 3.3% and
1.9% of sales respectively, which is the average figure for
recent years;
(v) Depreciation on existing fixed assets will continue at current
rates;
(vi)  Commodities and service taxes on existing production will
continue to average 6.5% of annual sales revenue;
(vii) Long-term loans, totaling kyats 390 million at the end of
fiscal 1981/82, will be repaid according to current
schedules; and no new loans will be taken; and
(viii) The contribution of profits to the State will continue to be
fixed at 30% of net profits.
7.09      Projected income statements, cash flow and balance sheets for this
"without project" case for TIC Textile Divisions have been prepared. These
are contained in Annexes 7-6 to 7-8, and are summarized below. These
projections show that on the basis of the assumptions made, TIC's Textile
Divisions financial situation should gradually improve as the impact of price
increases is felt and the benefits of the existing expansion programs are
realized.

3. Financial Impact of the Project on TIC's Textile Divisions
7.10      The financial projections for the Project have been integrated with
those of TIC Textile Divisions. For this purpose it has been assumed that
about 6 mlm of the domestically produced grey fabric for the finishing project
would represent additional production from existing facilities which cannot
now be produced because of a lack of finishing capacity. Revenues, and the
direct costs of production associated with these quantities have therefore
been included in the projections. It is also being assumed that the savings
in dye stuff, chemicals and energy due to closing down of the inefficient
small finishing mills amounting in total to about 15 million kyats annually,
is additional financial benefits which could be attributed to the Project.
Projected Income Statements, Cash Flow Statements and Balance Sheets for TIC
Textile Divisions, including the new Project and based on these assumptions,
are presented in Annexes 7-9 through 7-11 and are summarized for the first
five years of the new Project's operation in the following table:

7.11      These projections show that the financial performance of TIC Textile
Divisions would continue to be satisfactory with the addition of the proposed
Project, and financial ratios remain strong.
F. Financial Rate of Return
7.12      The financial rate of return for the Project has been calculated by
determining the net benefit to TIC Textile Divisions which accrues as a result
of the Project. In constant 1982 prices, the return is 20.9% biefore and 13.8%
after commodities and service tax (CST). Cost and benefit streams are shown
in Annex 7-12. Results of a sensitivity analysis are summarizedl in the
following table:

-Up by 10%                                            22.6             15.4
7.13      The sensitivity analysis shows the effect of a number of possible
changes which would affect project costs and benefits. As noted in Chapter
IV, product prices are calculated using a mark-up on production cost which
range from 5% to 20%, depending on the product. The Base Case return has been
determined using prices calculated with a 10% mark-up (paras 4.17-4.19). The
sensitivity analysis shows the effect of the selected different mark up levels
and demonstrates that the Project return is quite sensitive to this factor.
The analysis also shows the effect of reducing capacity utilization by
operating on only five days a week (240 days per year) instead of six. In
this case there is a significant drop in project profitability. Finally, the
analysis shows that the Project is able to withstand reasonable changes in
other assumptions.
G. Financial Covenants
7.14      The Government has agreed that, until such time as the jute and
textile operations of TIC are officially separated, it will cause TIC to keep
separate audited accounts in respect of (a) its textile operations and (b) its
jute operations. Moreover, the Government has confirmed that during the term
of the loan made pursuant the Subsidiary Loan Agreement to TIC (para 6.06),
the Governemnt will cause TIC not to borrow any additional funds (i) if this
would increase the Textile Divisions' debt:equity ratio (based on consolidated
accounts) above 50:50; or (ii) if a reasonable projection for the consolidated
Textile Divisions of TIC shows that the forecast debt service coverage ratio,
during the term of the debt to be incurred, would drop below 1.5 as a result



- 36 -
of such borrowing. Furthermore, the Government has agreed that it will cause
TIC to maintain a current ratio of at least 1.5:1 at all times in respect of
its textile operations.
H. Accounting and Management Information System
7.15      TIC maintains a double entry accounting system based on commercial
principles. The classification of accounts is uniform through all its mills.
Accounting records are well maintained and contain reasonable detail on the
corporation's cost, revenues, produc:tion, inventories and other financial and
operational data.
7.16      Since the introduction of "The Guidelines for Operation of State
Economic Enterprises Along Commercial Lines" (para 2.03), TIC has developed a
Management Information System (MIS). Under this System, the head office is
kept informed daily on such importarLt items as production figures and cash
position. There are weekly and monthly reports which are submitted to the
head office and subsequently discussed with the mill's representatives during
regular meetings held in Rangoon. TIC in turn, submits reports to the
supervisory Ministry of No. 1 Industry. TIC reporting requirements from 47
mills are quite iextensive and involve substantial clerical work and
bookkeeping with delays. These reports are currently being prepared
manually. The existing MIS fulfills the basic needs of TIC Management.
However, it requires major modification and strengthening to cope with the
increasing volume of management reporting, and the data handling necessary to
update actual costing for more effective cost accounting purposes.
Computerization of the system would improve the promptness and quality of
information specifically for costing systems (and consequently for pricing),
provide for improved planning and monitoring, andL provide for efficient prompt
cash management. Consultant services for the Project (para 5.11) will include
study and assistance to improve the Corporation's Management Information
Systems and its financial planning capabilities.
I. Auditing and Reporting Requirements
7.17      The people's Work Inspection Committee Act of 1974 regulates the
external auditing of all the State Corporations. The audit is conducted
annually by the Central Accounts Office, which is the only official audit
service in Burma, and has been used satisfactorily in other IDA projects in
the country. In TIC's case, as with some other State CorporatiorLs in Burma,
auditing is delayed. The audit for 1980/81 was completed in October 1983.
Accounts for 1981/82 and 1982/83 are being audited, and will be submitted to
the Association by about June 1984. The Government has agreed tc, make
suitable arrangements so that TIC's annual financial statements wiould be made
available for auditing and to IDA within six months of fiscal year-end and
audited financial statements would be made available to IDA within nine months
of the end of each fiscal year.
7.18      The Government has agreed that it will cause TIC to furnish to IDA
plans, specifications, reports, contract documents and construction and
procurement schedules for the Project, and any material modifications thereof
or additions thereto, in such detail as IDA shall reasonably request.
Moreover, the Government has confirmed that it will cause TIC to: (i)
maintain records and procedures adequate to record and monitor the progress of



- 37 -
the Project including its costs and the benefits to be derived from it, to
identify the goods and services financed out of the proceeds of the loan, and
to disclose their use in the Project; (ii) enable IDA's accredited
representatives to visit the facilities and construction sites included in the
Project and to examine the goods financed out of the proceeds of the loan and
any relevant records and documents; (iii) furnish to IDA at regular intervals
all such information as IDA shall reasonably request concerning the Project,
and (iv) after completion of the Project, to prepare and furnish to IDA a
comprehensive report on the Project, its implementation, initial operation and
the costs and benefits derived and expected to be derived therefrom.
VIII.   ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND RISKS
A. Adjusted Costs and Benefits for Economic Analysis
8.01      The assumptions concerning adjustments made to financial costs and
benefits to obtain economic values are detailed in Annex 8-1. Capital costs
have been adjusted by removing customs duty and commodities and service tax on
imported materials and equipment. Tradeable items are valued at their CIF
border price, expressed in local currency at the official exchange rate. For
non-tradeables, a standard conversion factor of 0.8 has been applied to
financial costs to estimate economic equivalents. Labor has been
shadow-priced at 66% of its financial cost. The financial cost of fuel has
been multiplied by a factor of 2.3 to approximate its opportunity cost.
8.02      Economic prices for textile goods are difficult to establish.
Because of the economic slowdown, current world textile prices are some 10-15%
lower than long-term price levels. Also, textile product prices vary
substantially, depending on quality, type of order and sources of supply.
Prices for fabrics, for example, produced in the East Asia region are some
20-30% lower than those from Europe and North America. For the proposed
Project, the prices used are for both grey and finished fabric based on
average CIF current prices in Europe, as well as East Asia, expressed in
constant 1982 terms, which are 10-15% below the long-term average world
prices. The economic prices assumed are given below:

B. Economic Rate of Return
8.03      Economic cost and benefit streams, brought to a constant 1982 price
basis, are shown in Annex 8-2. The base case economic rate of rieturn (ERR)
for the Project is 20.4%. The difference between this figure and the
financial rate of return of 13.8% is due to lower capital costs with the
removal of import duties (+3.9%); adjustments due to prices which are slightly
higher than the financial prices (+2.2%), the use of a conversion factor on
non-tradeable inputs (+1.1%), higher fuel price (-0.8%) and the shadow-pricing
of labor (+0.2%)., The results of a sensitivity analysis of this rate of
return are summarized in the following table:

Nominal Margin Between Gray and Finished Fabric
- Up from US$0.76 to US$0.87 (+15')                       23.5
- Down from US$0.76 to US$0.66 (-15%)                     17.1
Capital Cost Changes
-  Up by 10%                                              18.8

-  One year delay in start-up                             17.8
-  One year delay in reaching capacity                    19.6
Capacity Utilization
-  Operation for 240 days instead                         16.9
of 295 days (down by 18%)
-  Up by 10%                                              22.2
8.04      The sensitivity analysis shiows that the Project's ERR is relatively
insensitive to moderate changes in most of the assumptions concerning costs
and productivity. Of particular interest is the margin between the economic
prices of grey and finished fabric. From the table in para 4.18, it can be
seen that this margin ranges from US$0.63 per linear meter for cotton cellular
to US$0.90 per linear meter for cotton drills. The weighted average margin
for the product mix for the proposed Project is US$0.76. If this margin were
to increase by 15% to US$0.87, the rate of return would increase to 23.5%. If
the margin were to decrease by 15% to US$0.66, the rate of return would be
decreased to 17.1%. In fact, the margin is unlikely to change substantially,
as textile finishing operations throughout the world are based on such margins
which in the long run must be adequate to cover investments in finishing
plant and the costs of operation. The plant proposed for Burma is modern and



- 39 -
efficient and should be able to remain competitive with similar plants in
other locations.
C. Other Benefits
8.05      The Project would help restructure textile operations and upgrade
the Financial, Accounting and Management Information Systems of TIC through
Technical Assistance (para 7.16). Also, as part of the Project, a study of
all aspects of the textile sector will be undertaken which would specifically
lead to improved operation and would develop the appropriate sector strategy.
D. Risks
8.06      Apart from the normal risks associated with such projects such as
shortfall in allocation of foreign exchange for operations and lower plant
productivity than anticipated, there are three other risks which require
consideration. First, past experience in Burma shows that civil works often
cause delays due to: (i) inadequate construction management control and
planning systems; and (ii) shortages in the allocation of local construction
materials. The arrangements outlined in para 5.11, specifically formation of
Project Office assisted by a Project Engineering Firm (PEF) with
responsibilities in civil works design, supervision, construction monitoring
and cost control systems, should minimize concern over the adequacy of the
construction management control and planning system. With regard to
construction materials, all major local building materials such as cement,
bricks, tiles, and asbestos sheets are produced in the Ceramic Corporation
which is also under the Ministry of No. 1 Industry. With both TIC and Ceramic
Corporation being under one Ministry, there is less likelihood of problems in
the allocation of building materials to the Project. In addition, as stated
in para 5.11, the Government would undertake to ensure the timely supply of
construction materials which would further minimize this risk to an acceptable
level. The second risk relates to the possibility of finished fabric prices
being lower, and the cost of grey fabrics higher, than those projected.
Adopting a pricing mechanism as stated in para 4.19, with the Government
undertaking that it would take no action concerning the operations of TIC
which would prevent the Project, when operating efficiently, from obtaining a
reasonable return on invested capital is a satisfactory arrangement to
minimize this risk. The third risk is associated with projected increased
capacity utilization. This risk is addressed under the proposed training
program and post commissioning services which will: (i) provide for overseas
training, as well as on-site training of Burmese personnel, before and after
plant commissioning; (ii) provide all manufacturing and processing formula and
other relevant technical information; and (iii) set up and implement such
production control scheme concerning quantities and qualities of production as
may be needed.
E. Policy Considerations
8.07      The proposed Project, which will be an instrument for further
continuation in policy dialogue between the Government and the Association,
will address several sector issues. As part of the Project, first, a study



- 40 -
covering all facets of the textile sector will be undertaken by the Industrial
Planning Department of the Ministry of No. 1 Industry.  The study will be made
available to IDA for review and would be a suitable tool for continuation of
policy dialogue (para 3.07), particularly in such areas as improvement in the
capacity utilization of TIC mills, financial management in TIC, pricing
mechanism as well as development of overall fiber supply strategy including
imports. Second, the above study includes an action plan for the
implementation of the recommendations of the study. This, together with the
consultation between the Government and the Association for new projects (in
excess of US$10 million--para 5.11), will ensure that the sector will develop
and restructure in an orderly fashion. Third, technical restructuring of the
textile sector will commence by separation of the jute operations from
textiles, and the physical reorganization and closing of small finishing
operations will be studied. Fourth, The Government has agreed to cause TIC to
operate the proposed Project for 7,080 operational hours per year (295 days a
year, 3 shifts). This is significantly higher than the current working hours
of TIC (240 days a year, 2 shifts a day). While this agreement will ensure
the viability of the Project, it will also demonstrate the operational
feasibility and financial/economic impact of the increased capacity
utilization. Fifth, TIC will engage and retain the services of a qualified
consulting firm to assist in:  (a) design, engineering and advising/assisting
TIC in training and commissioning of the Project. This project implementation
approach would allow TIC to assume an active role in project implementation,
and moreover, it would assist in thes transfer of modern technolcigy and skills
to TIC staff; and (b) the design, implementation, and automation of an
effective cost accounting system, a financial planning system, and a
management information system.  With this assistance, TIC would improve its
quality and promptness of information, specifically for costing systems, and
consequently for pricing systems, as well as for financial planning and
control systems.
IX. AGREEMENTS
9.01      Agreement has been reached with the Government on the following
points:
(i) The objectives and Terms of Reference of the sector study, and
that such study will be carried out before December 31, 1985
and will be made avaiLlable, in a timely manner, to IDA for
review and comment. The report would include an action plan
for the implementation of the recommendations thereof (para
3.07);
(ii)  That it will review with the Association by May 31, 1984, the
then current status of organizational changes in Burma's
textile sector insofar as these would affect TIC's current jute
operations. Moreover, the Government will cause TIC to
maintain separate financial accounts and reports, starting
April 1984 until such time as TIC's jute operations are
transferred to a new jute corporation (para 3.17);



- 41 -
(iii)  That it will cause TIC to establish prices for Project output
based on the Project cost structure. Moreover, it will not
take nor cause to be taken any action which, assuming
production under conditions of efficient operation, would
prevent TIC from earning a reasonable rate of return on
invested capital with respect to the Project (para 4.19);
(iv) That it will cause TIC to operate the Project for at least
7,080 hours per year (para 5.02);
(v) That it will make satisfactory arrangements for the timely
procurement of dyes, chemicals, spare parts, and other
maintenance materials for the Project (para 5.06);
(vi) That it will take appropriate measures to ensure that adequate
power is supplied in time for the Project (para 5.08);
(vii) That it will cause TIC to ensure that the plant shall be
designed and installed, and thereafter maintained and operated
in accordance with standards for environmental controls
established in guidelines satisfactory to the Borrower and the
Association (para 5.10);
(viii) That it will cause TIC to take appropriate measures to ensure
the timely supply of construction materials to the Project
(para 5.11);
(ix) That it will cause TIC to employ and retain a qualified Project
Engineering Firm until project completion (para 5.11);
(x) That it will cause TIC not to invest in new projects (other
than this Project) in excess of US$10 million equivalent before
project completion without prior consultation with IDA (para
5.11);
(xi) That it will cause TIC to ensure that the selection and terms
and conditions of employment of the PEF would be satisfactory
to IDA (para 5.13);
(xii) That it will cause TIC to prepare a training program for plant
personnel that will be submitted to IDA for its review and
comment by December 1984 (para 5.13);
(xiii) That it will meet and cause TIC to meet its financing
obligations to the Project in a timely manner. Further, that
it will make available any additional funds which may be
required to complete the Project under terms and conditions
acceptable to IDA (para 6.05);



- 42 -
(xiv)  That it will cause TIC to enter into a contractual agreement
with the Construction Corporation on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA, and furnish to IDA by September 30 each
year, commencing on September 30, 1984, proposed financial and
works plans and a plan for the provisions of construction
materials to meet the requirement of the civil works contract
for its review and comments (para 6.08);
(xv) That it will cause T-[C to adhere to the financial covenants
detailed in para 7.14; and
(xvi)  That it will cause TIC to adhere to the auditing and reporting
provisions detailed in paras 7.17 and 7.18.
9.03.     Appointment of a Project Engineering Firm (para 5.11) and execution
of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement (para 6.06) would be conditions of Credit
Effectiveness.
9.04      Based on the above agreements reached, the Project is suitable for
an IDA Credit of SDR 28.2 million (IJS$29.7 million equivalent).

BURMA - TEXTILE FINISHING PLANT PROJECT
Assumptions Used for Financial Projections
1.        The financial projections have been prepared in current terms
through 1987, the first year of operation, and at constant 1987 prices
thereafter. Prices and production costs have been escalated from the December
1982 base as follows:
Year                   Annual Escalation Rate
Local      Foreign
1983                        4%         8%
1984                       4%          7.5%
1985                       4%          7%
1986 and thereafter         4%         6%
2.        It has been assumed that plant will begin operations in July 1987.
3.        It is expected that after a three-year period of build-up, plant
will eventually reach and sustain production levels of about 70% of design
capacity which represents planned production for the purpose of these
projections. Production in the intermediate start-up years would be as
follows:
Production         Percent of Planned
Year              Fabric ('00071m)           Production
1987/88                 7,300                   44
1988/89                13,280                   80
1989/90                16,600                  100
1990/91                16,600                  100
Year-by-year production for each of the five grades of fabric is presented in
Annex 7-2.
4.        The Project has been assumed to operate for 20 years from the start
through the end of the financial year 2006/07.
5.        Average 1982 prices for each product are shown (in both US$ and
kyats) in Annex 7-2. Because domestic prices are influenced by both internal
and external movements in textile prices, these 1982 prices have been
escalated to 1987 levels using the average of the projected local and foreign
escalation rates shown above (para 1). Revenue projections are shown together
with detailed projected production in Annex 7-3.

ANNEX 7-1
Page 2 of 2
6.        Direct production cost estimates at 1982 prices at full production
are shown in Annex 7-4. Projections through the start-up years, including
price escalation to 1987 levels, are shown in the projected income statement
for the Textile Finishing Project in Annex 7-5.
7.        The total installed cost of the plant has been depreciated over the
full 20-year life of the Project.
8.        Terms of the loans to the Project have been assumed to be as
follows:
Government        Proceeds of
Contribution       IDA Credit
Amount (Kyats million)             231                229
Interest Rate (%)                    5               8.5
Grace Period (years)                 5                  5
Repayment Period (years)            10                 10
9.        Projections of income, cash f:Low and balance sheets have b,een
prepared on TIC's Textile Divisions on the assumption that the proposed new
Textile Finishing Project does not go ahead. These projections, which were
prepared with the assistance of TIC, are included in Annexes 7-6 through 7-8.
Thus, the sales revenues, production costs, and debt-service streams for the
Finishing Project have been added to the TIC's Textile Divisions projections
to show its financial position with the new Project. Projected Income
Statements, Cash Flow Statements and Balance Sheets under these conditions are
shown in Annexes 7-9 through 7-11.

ANNEX 8-1
BURMA - TEXTILE FINISHING PLANT PROJECT
Assumptions Used for Economic Projections
1.        Economic projections have been prepared by adjusting financial net
benefit streams as follows:
(i)  Capital costs have been adjusted by removing customs duty and
commodities and serv:ice tax. This has the effect of reducing
the overall Project cost by some 15%.
(ii) Sales revenues have been adjusted by using economic, rather
than financial product selling prices. Since in some cases
domestic prices are lower than international prices, and in
other cases higher, the net effect is very small.
(iii) Production costs have been adjusted by using world prices for
tradeable raw materials and supplies. For non-tradeables, a
standard conversion factor of 0.8 has been applied to financial
costs to estimate economic equivalents. Labor has been
shadowed-priced at 66% of its financial cost. Fuel cost has
been multiplied by a factor of 2.3 to approximate its
opportunity cost.
2.        Individual adjustments, the resultant net economic benefit stream
and the base-case economic rate of return are shown in Annex 8-2. The
sensitivity of this result to changes in various assumptions is discussed in
Chapter VIII of the Appraisal Report.
