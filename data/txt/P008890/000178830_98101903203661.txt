FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EXPORT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project to expand Turkey's fruit and
vegetable exports through increased production and provision of necessary
handling facilities. The Project would aim at improving all subsystems of
the fruit and vegetable export industry, including production, collecting,
grading, packing, marketing and transport. It recommends a ferry ship sys-
tem, a completely new mode of transport for Turkey, involving two ships;
about 380 refrigerated trailers; and about 100 towing units. Also, it would
include export handling facilities with a capacity of about 150,000 tons and
the development of about 8,000 ha of citrus plantations by some 2,000 farm-
ers. In addition, funds would be made available for training and for techni-
cal assistance.
ii.       The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan/IDA credit would be made
available by the Government of Turkey to the Agricultural Bank of the
Turkish Republic (ABT) for on-lending to farmers and to private export and
transport companies, and 'to a Fruit and Vegetable Export Project Unit to be
set up under the newly created Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations (MFER).
iii.      ABT is the largest bank in Turkey - a semi-autonomous Government-
owned statutory body, founded in 1863. Total assets on December 31, 1969
were TL 17,000 million (US$1,100 million). Modest, but regular, profits
are reinvested. In 1964, ABT started a medium- and long-term credit scheme,
and in 1968, for larger loans, established a Development and Encouragement
Loans Division, which would be responsible for administering credit under
the Project.
iv.       The Project Unit would be responsible for technical evaluation and
supervision of subloans, monitoring of procurement requirements, coordination
with Government and private agencies in export marketing programs and market
development, and training.
v.        The Project is estimated to cost US$44 million equivalent, includ-
ing US$2 million in technical services. The latter include Project manage-
ment, consulting services, research, extension, and a study of future credit
needs of Turkish agriculture. The foreign exchange costs of the Project
would be about US$25 million equivalent.
vi.       Procurement of all transport and export handling facilities would
be by international competitive bidding, with the total cost of these items
about US$24.6 million. Because items required for the on-farm citrus devel-
opment component include small quantities of variable inputs, they would be
unsuitable for bulk procurement and would be purchased through normal com-
mercial channels where supplies and competitive firms are adequate.



- ii -
vii.      Turkey's fruit and vegetable net export earnings, aided by the
Project, would grow from about US$20 million at present to about US$50 mil-
lion at full development. The Project would provide transport facilities for
about 100,000 tons of increased exports by 1975 and export handling facili-
ties for about 150,000 tons. The on-farm citrus development would provide
for growing domestic needs and additional exports beginning in 1978. The
savings in transport costs, plus the increase in incomes to farmers and ex-
porters, would result in an economic return of 27%.
viii.     The Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$10 million for a term
of 20 years, including a five-year grace period, and an IDA credit of US$15
million on IDA's standard terms. The borrower would be the Government of
Turkey, which would assume the foreign exchange risk.



TURKEY
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EXPORT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Turkey has requested World Bank Group assistance
of US$25 million to help finance a project of fruit and vegetable export
expansion. The Project, which is a part of Government's program for export
development, is designed to provide a completely new mode of transport in-
volving two ferry ships, refrigerated trailers and towing units; export
handling facilities for fruit and vegetable exports; on-farm development
for about 8,000 ha of citrus; and technical assistance.
1.02      The Project would be the sixth and largest agriculture project
financed in Turkey by the Bank Group. Previous loans and credits for the
agricultural sector are: US$4 million in 1971 for dairy development (IDA
Credit 236-TU); US$24 million in 1969 (IDA Credit 143-TU and Bank Loan 587-TU
and US$20 million in 1963 (IDA Credit 38-TU) for irrigation; US$11 million
in 1952 for general agriculture (Bank Loan 63-TU); and US$2.9 million in 1950
for grain storage (Bank Loan 27-TU).
1.03      The Project was prepared by the Turkish State Planning Organization
(SPO), assisted by a Bank/IDA mission that visited Turkey in February 1970
and by two consulting firms, BASICO of Frankfurt and TUMAS of Ankara. This
report is based on the findings of a Bank/IDA mission to Turkey in October/
November 1970, composed of Messrs. T. Davis, P. Courbois, and D. Martinusen
(Bank/IDA) and Messrs. L. Collyer, M. de Groot, H. Ronday, and C. Stino (con-
sultants). Mr. Shamsher Singh and Miss Flora White (Bank) prepared the annex
on Market Prospects and Prices.
II. BACKGROUND -
A. General
2.01      Turkey has a total land area of about 780,000 km2 and a population
of approximately 35 million, increasing at about 2.5% per annum. GNP rose
about 6.9% per annum in real terms during 1963-67 and is expected to remain
at a rate of about 7% during the Second Five-Year Plan, 1968-72. Per capita
GNP is now about US$310.
2.02      Turkey suffers severe balance of payments problems, with imports
usually exceeding exports by more than 40%, and with large outlays for debt
service. Foreign exchange is allocated by comprehensive regulation, with
little regard to market forces.

of Turkey, IBRD Report No. E.M.A. 30a of February 1, 1971.



-2-
B. The Agricultural Sector
2.03      Agriculture employs 70% of the population, and accounts for about
30% of the Net Domestic Product. It supplies much of the raw material for
industry and accounts for 75% of the country's foreign exchange earnings.
Despite urbanization trends and industrial progress, the total size of the
agricultural population remains relatively stable. Farms are generally
small: almost 70% are less than 5 ha and 98% are below 20 ha.
2.04      There are four ecological regions -- Marmara and Black Sea, Aegean
and Mediterranean Sea, Anatolian Plateau, and Eastern Highlands -- and cli-
mate ranges from temperate to subtropical.  Annual rainfall runs from 350 mm
on the Anatolian Plateau to 2,400 mm on the northeast Black Sea Coast.  Ex-
cept on the eastern Black Sea Coast, summers are hot and dry (May to Septem-
ber). Temperatures vary from winter/summer averages of 4 and 18C in the
Eastern Highlands to 11* and 24C in the Aegean and Mediterraean. Daily
variations can be great and frost can occur throughout most of the country,
though rarely in the Mediterraean region. This region, along with the
Marmara and Black Sea region, are the principal areas for fruit and vegetable
production.
2.05      Turkish agriculture is characterized by a variety of crops.
Cereals are the most important (accounting for 80% of the cultivated land
area), followed by fruit and vegetables (10% of the cultivated land area).
fOf the remaining crops, cotton is important as an export crop and sugar beet
is vital because it provides all of the country's sugar requirements.
2.06      In 1969, agricultural products, accounting for about 75% of Turkey's
exports, were worth TL 6,075 million (US$405 million). Cotton, tobacco,
hazelnuts and raisins made up 80% of agricultural and 60% of total exports.
Fresh fruit and vegetable exports represented about 5% of exports and totaled
TL 300 million (US$20 million) in 1969, more than double the 1968 figure.
Since this exceeds the projections for the 1969-72 Five-Year Plan, SPO has
revised its goal to US$50 million by 1972, which is optimistic.
2.07      Because of low and variable rainfall, irrigation is essential for
increasing yields and cropping intensities and for growing high-value crops
for which climatic conditions are favorable but which need assured supplies
of water. About 1.5 million ha are irrigated now and about 5 million ha
have potential for development. IDA credits and a Bank loan 1/ are helping
finance the Seyhan Irrigation Project (US$20 million in 1963 and US$24 mil-
lion in 1969), which by 1973 will have developed 120,000 ha. The Seyhan
Project would provide 5,000 ha of the 8,000 ha of land on which citrus devel-
opment would be financed under the proposed project.
2.08      Machinery and fertilizer are being used more and more in Turkey.
Nitrogen fertilizer use has risen from 0.1 kg/ha cultivated land in 1960 to
1/   IDA Credits 38-TU and 143-TU and Bank Loan 587-TU.



about 10.5 kg/ha in 1969 1/, while the number of tractors has grown from
42,000 to 99,000.
C. Fruit and Vegetable Marketing Industry
Production
2.09      Turkey produces a variety of fruits and vegetables in quantities
sufficient for a large domestic consumption and for expanded exports (Annex
1).   Because of the climate and the need for irrigation, fruit and vege-
table production is concentrated along the Mediterranean and Aegean Coasts,
with some deciduous fruit and vegetable production in mountain valleys
throughout the country.
2.10      The most important fruits are grapes, 3,725,000 tons; apples,
700,000 tons; citrus, 678,000 tons; peaches, 250,000 tons; figs, 215,000 tons;
and apricots, 55,000 tons. All of these have potential for export, except
apples, but the most promising are grapes, citrus, and peaches. In 1969,
90,000 tons of fruit and vegetables were exported, 60,000 tons of which
went to West Europe, the remainder mainly to Eastern European countries.
2.11      Grape exports (principally to Austria and Germany in refrigerated
trucks) increased from 5,200 tons in 1968 to 19,000 tons in 1969. Citrus
exports in 1969 were: lemons, 29,000 tons; mandarins, 25,000; oranges, 8,000;
and grapefruit, 1,500. Peach exports reached 2,000 tons.
2.12      Other fruits -- apricots, plums, cherries, strawberries, and
raspberries -- can also be grown under good conditions in Turkey, but have
not yet been tested as exports. Vegetable exports, although only 5,000 tons
in 1969, have potential for expansion, particularly early potatoes, onions,
artichokes, asparagus, bell peppers, capsicums, green beans and melons.
Varietal changes in vegetables are necessary and availability of seeds is a
limiting factor.
2.13      Turkey produces excellent fruit and vegetables; however, poor
selection, grading and handling result in export of much inferior produce
resulting in low grades and low prices on European markets. Not only does
Turkey lose revenues from these inadequate marketing practices, but current
levels of exports are endangered because competitive suppliers are shipping
increasingly better quality products. By acquiring modern equipment and
adopting modern quality control standards, Turkey could increase its income
from current export levels and also substantially increase volume. Lemons
serve as a good example. Although arriving early in the season in Hamburg,
Turkish lemons have a value of only US$160 per ton. By careful selection,
proper grading and handling, these lemons could fetch a price of US$190 per
1/   Very low, however, compared with other developing countries in Europe:
Spain 32.8, Yugoslavia 42.4, Greece 60.1.



-4-
ton. Also the period of export could be extended, even through the period
when quality produce from Italy and Spain enters the market (six weeks later
than Turkey).
Packinghouses and Cold Storage
2.14      Packinghouses are poorly used in Turkey (Annex 2).  Only 40% of
exported citrus is handled by them, with the balance, plus all of the domes-
tic supply, packed in the field. Two citrus packing plants in Mersin (see
Map) are operating below capacity and there are five minimal facilities
called packinghouses for satsumas (a special mandarin variety) in the lzmir
area; actually they are little more than sheds with small sizing machines.
However, if all citrus exports were required to go through packinghouses,
the existing plants would not be capable of handling the load and under pro-
jections of future exports, additional facilities would be required (para
5.04 and Annex 2). There is one small packing facility for peaches in Bursa
and nothing for other crops. To assure the quality necessary for meeting
competition on the European market, new complete houses, providing precooling,
washing, sorting, waxing and automatic boxing services, should be located
in production areas.
2.15      There are cold storage facilities totaling 420,000 m3 in Turkey,
but little capacity is available for fruit and vegetables. None is used for
precooling or storage for export. Such facilities must be located in the
production areas in connection with packing facilities (Annex 2).
Transport Infrastructure
2.16      Domestic freight transport is steadily shifting from rail to road.
While total rail-handled freight has remained static since 1960, truck
freight traffic has quadrupled. Hard surface roads have increased from 1,624
km in 1950 to about 16,000 km in 1969 (Annex 3).
2.17      Export freight from Turkey goes principally by ship (90%), but in
recent years truck transport to Europe has become important for high value
and perishable products such as fruits and vegetables. Rail has not been a
significant alternative because of longer transit times, higher cost, and
a lack of flexibility in shifting from one market to another. In 1969,
trucks carried 40,000 of the 60,000 tons of fruit and vegetables going to
Europe. About 16,000 tons were carried by Frintas (a new mixed ownership
Turkish Company) and most of the balance was hauled by trucks hired by Turk-
ish exporters from Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. Frintas, organized with Govern-
ment assistance in 1969, acquired 130 new refrigerated trucks. Other Turkish
companies have about 50 trucks capable of hauling international freight.
2.18      Overland hauling from Turkey to Western Europe encounters many
difficulties. Considering the long distances and numerous countries to be
traversed, performance is highly dependent on the drivers. Within Turkey
the ferry crossing of the Bosporus at Istanbul is time consuming and expen-
sive (a bridge will be completed in 1974). Unforeseen stoppages of Turkish
trucks at borders are particularly serious to the movement of perishables.



In November 1970, Bulgaria closed its borders to all Turkish traffic for
two weeks alleging fear of cholera; this resulted in the loss of some 5,000
tons of mandarin and grape exports valued at almost US$1 million. Turkey,
therefore, runs high risk in trying to establish a reliable international
land transport system through the Balkans.
2.19      Extensive studies have been made of sea-ship alternatives.  These
transport media are expanding rapidly in world trade and are gaining impor-
tance in the Mediterranean. Three ferry ships are currently being built for
use between Israel and North Adriatic ports. Turkey must have fast, reli-
able transport media consisting of small units for market flexibility to
sustain and expand its exports of fruit and vegetables.
2.20      Small volumes of high-value, off-season items are shipped by air
and, because of high rates (about US$280 per ton to London), air shipment
will continue to be limited to such produce for quite some time.
Box and Carton Manufacture
2.21      Exporters currently use wooden "Bruce boxes" or trays, which are
made domestically but are of a type which is inadequate for expanded exports.
Additional box manufacturing is needed and quality should be supervised,
output standardized, and the more attractive and stronger poplar wood used
instead of pine. There is no shortage of such wood in Turkey. Locally made
cartons are also available but extremely expensive because of the high cost
of domestically produced kraft paper (the product from which cartons are
made and which represents 80% of the cost).
D. Export Market Program for Fruit and Vegetables
2.22      The Government of Turkey has a many-faceted program for encourag-
ing export of fresh fruit and vegetables, and SPO puts high priority on
achieving an expansion as the most promising way of increasing foreign
exchange earnings.
Export Credit
2.23      Exporters who file annual plans with SP0 are granted short-term
credit at 6% interest to contract for and export fruit and vegetables. This
credit, at substantially less than market rates, has been a key incentive
during 1968, 1969 and 1970 export seasons.
Export Regime Exchange Premium
2.24      Prior to devaluation in August 1970, exporters received a pre-
mium to balance domestic prices with European prices on particular products.
Since August, a new incentive has come into play. Firms exporting a minimum
of US$1 million of fruit and vegetables in one calendar year will get a
premium of 10% of the net foreign exchange proceeds. The minimum limit of



-6-
US$1 million will be increased by 20% in each consecutive calendar year
after January 1, 1972. This minimum is designed to make consolidation of
exports attractive to larger firms, who will, thereby, be able to manage
them on a consistent basis, with more bargaining power.
Trade Relationships
2.25      On December 1, 1964, Turkey became an associate member of the Euro-
pean Economic Community (EEC) under an agreement calling for full membership
in 17 to 29 years, in three stages: preliminary, transitional, and final.
Turkey moved through the preliminary stage very quickly and the agreement for
the transitional stage was signed on November 23, 1970. This stage aims at
establishing a customs union within 12 years. The preferences granted Turkey
in the transitional stage include a 40% reduction on EEC import duties oa
oranges; a 50% reduction on lemons, mandarins and other fruits; and a 100%
reduction on table grapes. All of these reductions are conditioned on
Turkish exporters selling at or above the reference price established by
the EEC commissioners. In case Turkey sells at less than the reference
price, a compensatory duty is levied. When the customs union is established,
Turkey will be protected by the reference price system of the EEC that as-
sures a floor price to member countries. Trade with European Free Trade
Association (EFTA) countries (which have no common agriculture policy) is
based on regular national trade policies. Substantial tariff reductions
have been achieved through Kennedy Round negotiations.
Production Companies and the Central Marketing Company
2.26      In 1968, SPO, through the use of exporters' short-term credit,
encouraged the creation of four production companies to organize exports of
fruit and vegetables. These are regionally located in fruit and vegetable
areas and are entirely private corporations, the shareholders being princi-
pally the larger fruit growers. The four, plus one private cooperative,
handled 80% of the total fruit and vegetable exports in 1969. Exports in-
creased from US$9 million in 1968 to US$20 million in 1969, and further in-
creases are expected for 1970 when final figures are reported.
2.27      In November 1970, SPO encouraged the five companies, as well as a
new cold storage company and the Frintas Transport Company, to subscribe to
the capital shares of the recently formed Central Marketing Organization,
MEPA (Merkezi Pazarlama Anonim Ortakligi). Its function is to export the
output of the existing production companies and of other producers. MEPA
would contract with producers several months prior to the harvest season in
order to rationalize supply of exportable produce. It would take over exist-
ing European agency relationships of its member companies and add new staff,
thereby organizing a complete sales organization. Revenues would be returned
to the producers after deducting all costs, including administration, plus
a small percentage for an export stabilization fund. Thus, MEPA would be
able to export on a consistent basis and in the volumes necessary to compete
on the growing European markets.



E. The Agricultural Bank of Turkey
2.28      Almost all the institutional credit available to farmers in Turkey
is provided by the Agricultural Bank of Turkey (ABT). ABT is a semi-autono-
mous body, wholly owned by the Turkish Government, subject to the Banking
Law of 1958, and governed by a six-member Board of Directors appointed
by the Council of Ministers (Cabinet). Its purpose is to finance agricul-
tural, fishery and forestry production and marketing and allied activities.
ABT has over 700 branches and holds about 25% (about US$580 million) of all
deposits in the banking system. Assets on December 31, 1969 totaled TL 16,764
million (US$1,100 million). Though profit is not its primary objective, ABT
is administered as a profit-making institution and all profits are reinvested.
2.29      Seventy percent of its lending is short-term, much of it highly
standardized, with fixed amounts per ha according to crop purpose, but it
has been attempting to extend its medium- and long-term lending. In 1964,
it began a supervised medium- and long-term credit scheme, based on farm
forecasts and technical guidance and, in 1969, created a Project Loans
Department, for somewhat larger projects in irrigation, livestock, export
promotion, food processing, agricultural chemicals, transportation, and
storage. Further details of ABT are in Annex 4.
2.30      ABT interest rates for most agricultural loans are fixed at 10.5%
per annum. Special lower rates are laid down for certain types of lending,
e.g. export promotion. Commercial (non-agricultural) loans may be made up
to the legal maximum of 11.5%. For details on the interest policy of ABT,
see Annex 5. Since most of ABT's lending is to numerous small farmers (2
million borrowers with loans averaging TL 1,759 (US$200) in 1968), overall
costs of administration are high.
2.31      Many of these small seasonal loans are in default and ABT's opera-
tions in this sector are not satisfactory. A comprehensive credit study
would be financed under the Project to improve the organization and supply
of agricultural credit (see para 3.20). However, ABT's Project Loans Depart-
ment has a good record and a staff well trained in banking practices. This
Department would be the lending channel for the Project.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Brief Description
3.01      The Project forms a part of Turkey's export development program by
providing credit to enterprises and farmers for improving transport, packing,
and storage of export fruits and vegetables and for planting citrus. It
involves:



(a)  Transportation - Credit to transport companies for two
ferry ships, 385 refrigerated trailers, and 100 towing
units (44% of total investment);
(b)  Export handling facilities - Credit to private companies
for packinghouses, cold storage, and box manufacturing
plants (11%);
(c)  On-farm citrus development - Credit to about 2,000 farmers
for establishment of about 8,000 ha of citrus orchards and
for about 60 ha of nurseries (38%); and
(d)  Technical assistance - Finance to provide technical ad-
visory services to subborrowers, citrus research, and
a comprehensive credit survey (7%).
3.02      The Project would be coordinated by a Fruit and Vegetable Export
Project Unit, headed by a Project Director to be established within the newly
created Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations (MFER). The Project Unit
would provide technical services to subborrowers for transport and export
handling facilities. Subborrowers for citrus establishment within the Seyhan
Irrigation Project (para 2.07) would receive technical services from the
existing Seyhan Integrated Extension Unit (SIEU), which was established under
the Bank/IDA financial project (para 2.07); while subborrowers outside that
project would be served by a new Citrus Extension Unit (CEU). The credit
channel would be the Agricultural Bank of Turkey (para 2.28), which would
rely on the above-mentioned technical services for technical appraisal of
all subloan applications. Applied citrus research would be carried out by
two existing research institutes. The credit survey would be carried out by
consultants to MFER.
B. The Project Areas
3.03      The transport facilities financed by the Project would not be con-
fined to a particular geographical area but would serve the entire fruit and
vegetable export industry in Turkey. Headquarters of the ferry ship opera-
tions would be in Izmir and trucking companies would be located in various
cities serving main production areas, such as Adana, Mersin, Antalya, Izmir,
Bursa, and Iznik (Map). These would also be the areas for location of the
export-handling facilities.
3.04      The on-farm citrus development would be located in the Adana Plain
within the provinces of Adana, Icel, and Hatay (Map). This plain covers
about 250,000 ha, of which about 170,000 ha are irrigable. A large part
(5,000 ha) of the on-farm citrus development area (8,000 ha) lies within the
area served by the Seyhan Irrigation Project. The Seyhan Project, assisted
by Bank and IDA financing, would provide the irrigation, land development,
and a part of the extension services for citrus (especially lemons, grape-
fruit, and oranges) within its boundaries.



- 9 -
3.05      Other major production areas, producing citrus, grapes, peaches
and vegetables from existing plantations, are the coastal region and river
valleys along the Aegean and Mediterranean coasts and the Marmara and Black
Sea region around Istanbul. These areas produce large quantities of fruit
that would be transported by ferry ship trailers.
C. Detailed Features
Ferry Ships and Auxiliary equipment
3.06      Credit would be provided for the purchase of two ferry ships to
provide a twice weekly service from the Turkish port of Izmir to Trieste
(Italy) and/or Koper (Yugoslavia), principally to carry refrigerated trail-
ers loaded with fruit, vegetables, fish and meat to European markets. The
trailers would carry general cargo on the return journey. The two ferry
ships together would be able to transport about 100,000 tons of produce per
year, which represents about 50% of the projected demand by 1975 for this
kind of service. Chapter V and Annex 6 present further details.
3.07      Each ship would have a dead-weight tonnage of about 3,000 and be
capable of carrying about 65 40-foot refrigerated trailers at a minimum
service speed of 18.5 knots. Such ferry ships are readily available from
shipyards having their own standard designs so that it would not be necessary
to employ naval architects to design the ships in detail before ordering.
However, consultants would be employed by the Project Unit to assist the
subborrower in drawing up specifications and in evaluating bids. Further
technical details are given in Annex 6, Appendix 3.
3.08      Infrastructure to handle such ferry ships already exists at Izmir
and facilities are presently being built at Trieste and Koper and would be
available before 1972. Assurances were obtained from ABT during negotia-
tions that no order would be placed until Bank/IDA had received confirma-
tion that the port authorities at Koper or Trieste would be willing to make
the necessary operating arrangements for the proposed ferry ships.
3.09      Government has not yet decided whether the subborrower should be
the State-owned Turkish Cargo Lines (TCL), an existing privately-owned ship-
ping company, or a consortium of shipping companies (perhaps also involving
TCL). Any of these might be satisfactory, provided that suitable management
and overseas arrangements have been made. Assurances were obtained from ABT
during negotiations that no ferry ships would be ordered until after
Bank/IDA had approved the subborrower and its management and overseas
arrangements.
Refrigerated Trailers and Towing Units
3.10      Credit would be provided for about 385 20-ton capacity refrigerated
road trailers, which would be purchased by experienced road transport enter-
prises to carry fruit, vegetables, and other cargo on ferry ships, princi-



- 10 -
pally to European markets on the outward journey and general cargo on the
return journey. Demand for this service is analyzed in Chapter V and Annex
6.
3.11      About 100 towing units would also be purchased.  The mix of trail-
ers to towing units may change over the disbursement period; however, overall,
the demand for road transport equipment is expected to match the ferry ship
capacity, i.e. about 100 towing units and 385 trailers.
3.12      The Project Unit, assisted by consultants, would assist subbor-
rowers in determining their needs and in preparing subloan applications to
ABT which would also be subject to Bank/IDA approval (paras 4.02 and 4.11).
Export Handling Facilities
3.13      Credit would be provided to individuals, corporations and coopera-
tives engaged in export activities for packinghouses and cold storage units
designed to handle fruit and vegetable exports. These facilities would make
it possible to raise the quality of Turkish fruit exports, compared to
present field packing practices (para 2.14), inter alia by more careful siz-
ing and rejecting of substandard items; degreening of citrus; fumigation
and precooling of table grapes prior to loading aboard refrigerated trailers;
and exclusive use of packing cases acceptable to importing houses in Europe
and elsewhere. The total output of the proposed facilities would be about
150,000 tons. Consultants would be employed by the Project Unit to assist
subborrowers to design their proposed export-handling facilities and to
establish their individual viability.
3.14      To insure quality of exports, assurances were obtained from Gov-
ernment that it would promulgate an Export Regime requiring that all exports
of fresh fruit and vegetables go through packinghouses approved by the Min-
istry of Commerce no later than January 1, 1975 and that inspection programs
be established to enforce quality standards for products and packaging, as
set by OECD and the importing countries (Annex 7).
3.15      Credit would also be provided for construction of additional facil-
ities for production of export quality packing cases to satisfy the demand
expected to be generated inter alia by the proposed new packinghouses. How-
ever, at the time of appraisal, sufficient preparation of typical subprojects
had not been carried out to establish the most appropriate type of packing
case to be produced, taking into account expected longer term trends. As
mentioned in paragraph 4.11, subloans over US$250,000 would require approval
by Bank/IDA.
On-farm Citrus Development
3.16      Credit would be provided to about 2,000 farmers for planting and
bringing citrus orchards to maturity.  Taking into account the availability
of suitable planting material (para 3.17), planting is expected to be phased
approximately as follows:



- 11 -
Production in
Hectares                      tons at full
Variety                Year 1  Year 2  Year 3  Year 4  Total         development
Oranges                 130      380      500       790   1,800        54,000
Lemons                  180      520      700    1,100   2,500         83,000
Mandarins                160     490      640    1,010   2,300         69,000
Grapefruit              100      290      390      620   1,400         70,000
TOTAL         570   1,680   2,230    3,520   8,000         276,000
It is expected that about 5,000 ha out of 8,000 ha of this development would
be within the Seyhan Irrigation Project area (para 3.04), with the remainder
in adjacent areas of the Adana Plain (see Map). Assurances were obtained
from ABT during negotiations that Project lending for citrus development
would be confined to the Project area and to the number of hectares and for
the varieties specified.
3.17      It is particularly important that the proposed citrus development
be based on improved varieties, appropriate to Turkish growing conditions
but also specifically suitable for export markets, and that, to avoid re-
currence of disease problems, virus-free nursery stock be used exclusively.
Shortages of such planting material account, in the main, for the relatively
small planting targets in the early years. In order to provide for the later
years (including beyond the Project period), the Project would provide
finance for the Citrus Research Institute in Mersin (para 3.19) to develop
a propagation farm and credit for private farmers to develop multiplication
nurseries totaling some 60 ha. The Institute would import budwood for
growing mother trees of all suitable species and varieties valuable to the
citrus industry and would establish a system of indexing and certifying
all propagation materials sold to private nurseries.  Some budwood stocks
and much of the vegetable seed must be imported, since production in Turkey
is non-existent or unreliable. All seed imports are made through the Minis-
try of Agriculture and, during negotiations, assurances were obtained from
Government that importation of seed and budwood recommended by the Project
Unit would be freely permitted and promptly arranged, and that only virus-free
certified budwood would be used in project plantings.
Technical Assistance and Credit Study
3.18      The Project includes the provision of technical advisory services
for all subborrowers. It involves permanent staff (probably including two
expatriates) in the Project Unit and the Citrus Extension Unit (Annex 8).
In addition, consultants in five specialties would be hired by the Project
Unit to assist subborrowers in preparing their feasibility studies,
the Project Unit in its technical appraisals, MEPA in organizing its market-
ing operations, and Government agencies in improving their quality control
programs. The consultants would be experts in:
(a) ferry ship operations;



- 12 -
(b) trucking company operations;
(c) export handling operations (packinghouses, storage and
box manufacturing);
(d) export marketing organization; and
(e) governmental quality control programs.
Assurances were obtained from Government during negotiations that the
above mentioned consultants would be appointed and would have prepared or
reviewed the necessary feasibility studies before any technical approvals
are made of subloans by the Project Unit and that the consultants and their
terms of reference would be subject to Bank/IDA approval.
3.19      The two existing Citrus Research Institutes, at Mersin and Antalya,
would carry out expanded programs of citrus research under the Project, in-
volving inter alia research into on-farm techniques, harvesting, packing and
storing. Also, finance would be provided for a citrus propagation farm to
be operated by the Mersin Institute to supply budwood to private nurseries.
Assurances were obtained from Government during negotiations that the
citrus budwood propagation farm would be established and that the research
programs would be approved by the Technical Advisor for Plantations and Pro-
duction of the Project Unit (para 4.03).
3.20      As part of the long-term development of Turkish agriculture, in-
cluding -- but not restricted to -- development of export fruit and vege-
tables, a comprehensive study of agricultural credit and credit institutions
would be carried out by consultants to MFER. It would be a condition of ef-
fectiveness of the loan/credit that Government had appointed consultants
mutually acceptable to Government and Bank/IDA. Their terms of reference
are tentatively set out in Annex 9.
D. Cost Estimates
3.21      The total cost of the Project is estimated at about TL 660 million
(US$44 million), of which about TL 375 million (US$25 million), or about 57%
of total costs, would be foreign exchange. Principal foreign exchange items
are imported ferry ships; imported transportation equipment and export hand-
ling equipment; imported planting material, pesticides, and fertilizers for
citrus orchards, nurseries, and propagation farms; and services of expatri-
ate staff and consultants. Project costs are summarized in the following
table. For further details, see Annex 10.

for export handling facilities. These import duties amount to 75% of CIF
value and would be about TL 7 million (US$460,000).
3.22      Cost estimates for imported equipment and machinery are based on
average manufacturers' prices CIF Turkey and those for constructing export

handling facilities and establishing citrus orchards are based on actual
costs of similar items in project areas. Costs of extension services reflect
present Government pay scales and actual current costs; salaries and allow-
ances assumed for expatriate personnel and consultants are adequate to in-
duce experienced personuxel to live temporarily in Turkey. Where local cost
data pre-date devaluation (August 1970), a 20% increase has been included
in baseline cost estimates, before addition of any contingencies.
3.23      A physical contingency of 5% has been added for the two ferry ships,
pending finalization of design specifications, and for trailers, towing units,
and export handling facilities. No physical contingencies have been included
for on-farm citrus development; thus, the overall physical contingency is
about 3Z. The price contingencies of 9% overall have been based on a 5% an-
nual increase in all prices, domestic and foreign.
E. Financing
3.24      The Project would be financed as follows:

The proposed Bank loan of US$10 million and IDA credit of US$15 million
(TL 375 million in all) would cover foreign exchange costs.  The Bank loan
would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace. The borrower
would be Government, which would assume the foreign exchange risk.



- 15 -
3.25      About US$1.2 million (TL 18 million) of the loan/credit would be
used by MFER and the Ministry of Agriculture for the Project Unit, CEU,
Citrus Research Institutes, and the agricultural credit survey.
3.26      Government would on-lend to ABT, in local currency, some US$23.8
million (about TL 360 million) at an annual interest of 7% with a term of
15 years, including 5 years of grace. It would be a condition of effectiveness
of the loan/credit that a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to Bank/IDA
had been executed.
3.27      With subborrowers making down payments averaging about 20% of sub-
project cost, ABT would need to provide about US$9.4 million (TL 140 million)
to finance the remaining local cost. Since ABT would receive about US$3.4
million (TL 51 million) from subborrowers over the project development period,
ABT would need only to find some US$6.0 million (TL 90 million). Since ABT
has a shortage of funds, assurances were obtained during negotiations that
the necessary local currency funds would be provided by Government to ABT.
F. Procurement
3.28      All transportation equipment and export handling facilities would
be procured following international competitive bidding procedures, arranged
by the Project Unit. Contracts for refrigerated trailers and towing units
for the various subborrowers would be bulked and the successful supplier
would be required to set up satisfactory service and spare parts facilities
in Turkish towns selected by the Project Unit. Because of the integrated
nature of the export handling facilities, each such facility would be pro-
cured through a single contract, including civil works, and the supply, in-
stallation, and trial running of equipment. For purposes of bid evaluation,
a 15% preference or the import duty, whichever is lower, would be allowed
in favor of domestic equipment supplies for the export handling facilities.
No preference would be given on other supplies because no import duties are
levied. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that these pro-
cedures would be followed and that all contract documents and awards, etc.,
would be subject to prior Bank/IDA approval (all such contracts are expected
to be for US$250,000 or more).
3.29      On-farm citrus development, involving mainly labor and only small
quantities of contracted land preparation and purchased inputs (nursery
stock, fencing, fertilizers, and pesticides) that are readily available
through existing commercial channels, would not be suitable for procurement
through international competitive bidding procedures.



- 16 -
G. Disbursement
3.30      The loan/credit would be disbursed against:
(a) 100% of the CIF costs of imported transportation
equipment;
(b) 43X of the cost of the export handling
facilities which represents the estimated
foreign exchange cost;
(c) 20% of all ABT subloan disbursements for on-farm citrus
orchard and nursery development, about equal to the average
foreign exchange component; and
(d) actual foreign exchange expenditures on technical assistance.
Disbursement requests would be accompanied by full import documentation or
certificates by ABT or the Project Director, as appropriate. An estimated
schedule of disbursements of the loan/credit, by quarters, is given in Annex
11. Any undisbursed funds resulting from cost savings would be cancelled.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project Administration
4.01      A Fruit and Vegetable Export Project Unit would be set up as a
division within MFER to administer the Project. It would coordinate export-
related activities of the Ministries of Agriculture, Finance, Commerce,
Communications, Village Affairs, and Foreign Affairs, and would provide
technical assistance to subborrowers. The Project Unit would be headed by
a Project Director, who would be assisted by a Technical Advisor for Trans-
port and Marketing Facilities and a Technical Advisor for Plantations and
Production. A clerical staff would perform support functions and consultants
would be engaged to assist in technical and managerial matters. Paragraph
3.18 and Annex 8 have further details. It would be a condition of effective-
ness of the loan/credit that the Project Unit had been set up and that the
Director and the two Technical Advisors mutually acceptable to Government and
Bank/IDA had been appointed on terms and conditions satisfactory to Bank/IDA.
4.02      The Ptoject Director would have overall responsibility for Project
implementation and for liaison with Bank/IDA, while the Technical Advisor
for Transport and Marketing Facilities would provide technical assistance to
subborrowers for export handling facilities and transportation. He would
help applicants in preparing the required feasibility studies and investment
and operational plans (para 4.11) and would also be responsible for technical
appraisal of subloans, as well as for supervision of procurement, construction,
and disbursement.



- 17 -
4.03      The Technical Advisor for Plantations and Production would coordi-
nate the on-farm citrus development. He would work with the Director of the
Seyhan Integtated Extension Unit (SIEU), the Citrus Extension Unit (CEU) (para
4.06), and ART. He would also be responsible for assuring that all in-
puts necessary for citrus development and export production of fruit and
vegetables were made available, including extension services, fertilizers,
nursery stock, seeds, and pesticides. Other responsibilities would include
assisting the production companies in working out contracts with growers and
establishing standards of quality in the production of fruit and vegetables.
He would also examine and approve research programs and certify expenditures
for foreign exchange costs of the research conducted by the citrus institutes
(para 4.08).
B. The Citrus Extension Unit
4.04      To insure an adequate staff of qualified people suitably equipped
to supervise the on-farm citrus development, a Citrus Extension Unit (CEU)
would be especially created in the Ministry of Agriculture. It would be the
nucleus for the long-range development of citrus production and would be ex-
panded steadily through later stages. CEU would be advised by a Regional
Citrus Development Coordinating Board which would include representatives of
the Horticulture Research Institute, the Regional Directorate for Soil and
Water Conservation, the Seyhan Irrigation Project Manager, ABT, and other
Ministries as agreed upon by the Project Unit. CEU would report to the
Minister of Agriculture.
4.05      CEU would be located in Cukurova and initially staffed with a Direc-
tor, two citrus specialists, a farm management specialist, and an irrigation
specialist. There would also be a minimum of three village agents who would
receive on-the-job training before assuming their duties. In the second
year, CEU would need seven agents and three trainees; in the third year,
10 agents and two trainees; and in the fourth year, 12 agents.
4.06      CEU would liaise with SIEU on matters relating to citrus develop-
ment loans made within the Seyhan Project areas (para 3.04). Actual service
to farmers would be provided within the Seyhan Project by SIEU and outside
the Seyhan by CEU. One citrus specialist from CEU would be seconded to SIEU
and the Director of CEU would sit on SIEU's coordinating committee.  The two
Units would be responsible for assisting farmers in their respective areas
in drawing up farm plans and for performing technical appraisals for the
local branches of ABT, according to established criteria.  Agents of the
Units would supervise credit use to insure that the best citriculture
practices were employed.
4.07      It would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan/credit that
CEU had been established and that a Director mutually acceptable to Govern-
ment and Bank/IDA had been appointed on terms and conditions satisfactory to
Bank/IDA.



- 18 -
C. Research
4.08      Research programs would be developed by the Citrus Research Insti-
tute at Mersin and the Citrus Research Institute at Antalya, and approved by
the Ministry of Agriculture and the Technical Advisor for Plantations and
Production. The Institute at Mersin would also be responsible for the propa-
gation farm. For details of the research program and costs, see Annex 8.
D. Lending Policies and Procedures
4.09      The lending channel for all subloans would be ABT.  The loans for
transportation and export handling facilities would be handled by the En-
couragement and Development Loans Division and the loans for citrus develop-
ment by the Projects Bureau, both under the Project Loans Department, headed
by the Secretary General (Annex 4, Appendices 1 and 2).
4.10      The interest rate to be charged to all subborrowers would be in
line with current rates charged by ABT (Annex 5). All subborrowers would be
required to provide 20% of the investment cost for which subloans are granted.
Subborrowers for transport would be required to deposit their 20% in ABT
prior to awarding contracts to suppliers. All subborrowers would be required
to provide assets financed by the subloans as collateral; however, ABT would
also investigate in detail subborrowers' projected cash flows and would not
be restrictive in its collateral requirements if subborrower financial pros-
pects appear satisfactory. Loans to subborrowers would not exceed the fol-
lowing interest rates, grace and repayment periods:
Grace  Repayment  Total  Interest   Added   Total
Period   Period    Term       Rate    25% Tax   Rate

Assurances were obtained from ABT during negotiations that the terms and con-
ditions specified above would not be changed without prior approval of Bank/
IDA.



- 19 -
4.11      Applicants for subloans for transport and export handling facilities
would submit technical feasibility studies and investment and operational
plans based on sound business planning. Each applicant would submit complete
historical financial data on his operations; an estimate of operations for
the next three to five years; details of his operational arrangements (in-
cluding overseas arrangements by trucking companies); and a detailed cash
flow statement for the next three to five years, showing requirements of
long-term and seasonal financing. Each subcontract with ABT would include
covenants limiting subborrowers' future indebtedness and providing for the
execution of operations under sound technical and financial conditions. As-
surances were obtained from ABT during negotiations that subloans for trans-
port and export handling facilities would require technical approval by the
Project Unit and would be made under criteria specified above, and that all
subloans over US$250,000 would be subject to prior Bank/IDA approval.
4.12      Applicants for subloans for on-farm citrus development and nurser-
ies would prepare and submit farm plans, assisted as necessary by CEU (para
4.06). Criteria for selecting participating farmers would include:
(a)  availability of properly irrigated, leveled and drained
land, with soils suitable for citrus development, which, to
avoid disease problems, have not been planted to citrus
within the preceding five years;
(b)  proven competence and experience in general farming practices;
(c)  availability of an overall farm plan, including financial
projections; and
(d)  creditworthiness.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from ABT that subborrowers
would be selected for on-farm citrus development as outlined above and that
the form of subloans would be acceptable to Bank/IDA.
4.13      ABT would set aside, from interest payments received from subbor-
rowers, amounts at the rate of 0.5% per annum in a Special Operational Fund
to be used for partial payment of operating expenses incurred by the Project
Unit. Expenditures from this Fund would be made only as authorized by the
Project Director or his designated representative. After the disbursement
period, continuation of the Fund would be subject to agreement by Government,
ABT and the Project Unit. Assurances were obtained from Government and ABT
during negotiations regarding the establishment of the Fund and its use.
E. Accounts and Audit
4.14      The Project Director would keep account of Project expenditures
on Project management, technical services, extension services, consulting
services, and research, and monitor progress on all subloans. Assurances
were obtained from Government during negotiations that reports in English,



- 20 -
audited in a manner acceptable to Bank/IDA, would be submitted to Bank/IDA
within five months of the end of the Government fiscal year.
4.15      A separate account for Project funds would be established within
ABT. Deposits into this account would be made up of: (a) Government on-
lending of Bank/IDA funds (para 3.26); (b) contributions of subborrowers
for transport equipment (paras 3.27 and 4.10); and (c) Government contribu-
tions of local currency funds (para 3.27). The account would also reflect
loans to and repayments from subborrowers. Assurances were obtained from
ABT during negotiations that the account would be audited in a manner accep-
table to Bank/IDA and that, within five months of the end of ABT's fiscal
year, audited financial statements in English would be sent to Bank/IDA.
V. MARKETS AND OPERATING RESULTS
A. Markets for Fruit and Vegetables
5.01      Although many fruits and vegetables have export potential (paras
2.09 to 2.13 and Annex 1), 90% of the tonnage is expected to be achieved
from citrus, grapes, new potatoes, and onions. A study of market prospects
for these items appears in Annex 12.
5.02      Although several countries in the Mediterranean region have suitable
ecological conditions for producing off-season horticulture produce, Turkey
has some advantages over its competitors. First, by concentrating production
of vegetables in the Adana and Antalya regions, Turkey should be able to ex-
ploit some climatic advantages over competitors on the north coast of the
Mediterranean. Second, because it does have available land transport or a
combined land and sea system, it should have an equal position or an advan-
tage over competitors on the south or east coast. Third, if Turkey takes
advantage of a new technology, such as plastic tunnels, early and late vari-
eties, and the hormone sprays, it should be able to exploit both a short
growing period and the season when prices are highest in Europe. Fourth,
because of lower wage rates than some major competitors, Turkey has the
advantage if lower production costs.
5.03      Demand for fresh fruit and vegetables is increasing in Europe, par-
ticularly for citrus varieties such as satsumas (a seedless mandarin) and
grapefruit. Increased demand is also foreseen for fresh grapes and early and
late season vegetables (Annex 12). The BASICO and TUMAS studies (para 1.03
and Annex 7) show the following estimates for Turkish exports in 1975:
Citrus     Grapes      Onions      Potatoes
-----------------…'OO tons---------------
1970 (Actual)          62.5      21.0           -           2.0
1975 (BASICO)         145.0      80.0         25.0         80.0
1975 (TUMAS)          152.5      85.0         25.0        125.0



- 21 -
According to BASICO (the more conservative of the two studies), the total ex-
port of the four main products by 1975 would be about 335,000 tons. In all
cases, the Turkish share of the European market would be relatively small,
varying from about 4% for onions to about 12.9% for early potatoes of pro-
jected Western European imports in 1975.
5.04      The proposed Project would provide export handling facilites for
citrus and grapes with a total capacity of about 150,000 tons, which could
be increased to about 200,000 tons depending on crop, season and operating
hours. Because the attainment of potential exports would depend on the ef-
ficiency of the export marketing effort and because some facilities would be
financed by private investors outside the Project, the proposed limited ca-
pacities to be financed under the Project are considered reasonable.
5.05      As indicated in Annex 7, Turkey's consumption of citrus is also
growing very rapidly. The proposed on-farm citrus development part of the
Project would provide about 275,000 tons of citrus production at full develop-
ment in about 10 to 14 years. Of this total, about 55,000 tons would be
oranges, which would probably not be exported because of home demand. Most
of the remaining 220,000 tons (lemons, mandarins, and grapefruit) could be
exported. Since full production from on-farm citrus development will not
be achieved for about 10 years, no export handling or transport facilities
are provided for this production under the Project.
B. Transport Demand
5.06      Of the total projected export by 1975 of about 335,000 tons of
fruit and vegetables -- about 60%, or about 200,000 tons, need to be trans-
ported by refrigerated trailer and ferry ship because the products involved
(satsumas, grapes, peaches, and vegetables) require rapid refrigerated
transport.
5.07      Under the proposed Project, transport facilities would be provided
to handle about 100,000 tons of refrigerated cargo. These facilities would
therefore provide about 50% of the expected transport demand. This transport
capacity is, therefore, a conservative minimum, making full utilization of
the facilities possible even during the off-season months. If demand in-
creases more than expected, additional facilities would be needed.
C. Operating Results
5.08      The financial rates of return of the various Project components
(Annex 13) are as follows:



- 22 -
Ferry ships                          17%
Trucking company                      32
Packing plant                        23
Cold storage                         19
On-farm citrus development:
Lemons                          16
Mandarins                       15
Oranges                         20
Grapefruit                      26
5.09      Transport to Europe by trailer and ferry ship would be substantially
cheaper than overland transport, even with the new bridge over the Bosporus
(para 2.18). The ferry ships are assumed to make 47 weekly sailings per year
charging US$540 per return trip per trailer. The assumed fare of US$540
would provide the ferry ships with a 17% rate of return and the trucking
company with a 20% saving on full costs on a typical Mersin/Munich return
trip. The trucking company is assumed to pass on to users (exporters and
importers) part of the savings made possible by the ferry ships in the form
of a 15Z reduction in truck rates. Further rate reductions are unlikely, but,
should an additional reduction of 20% occur during the low season, the rate
of return of a trucking company would become 21Z, which is still very satis-
factory.
5.10      The packinghouses and cold storages are assumed to operate on a
custom basis, charging existing rates for similar services, and to earn ade-
quate rates of return. Models for the on-farm citrus development were de-
veloped on the basis of plantings as part of existing irrigated (mainly
cotton) farms. The calculated financial rates of return are returns on
incremental investments because the opportunity cost of the land has been
fully deducted. As such, these returns are very satisfactory. Also, the
cash income of a farmer is attractive.
5.11      Models were constructed for a typical exporting company and for
ABT's project account. ABT would pay an interest to Government which
would allow for a 2.0% spread to ABT plus 0.5% for the Special Operational
Fund (para 4.13). These models show that export is a profitable undertaking
and that ABT can cover its administrative costs and slippage in collection and
have a reasonable profit margin from the Project.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The improved transport, packing, storage, and handling facilities
would greatly improve Turkey's competitive position for fruits and vegetables
in Western European markets. New plantings would provide additional produce
for the export and domestic markets. The overall Project economic rate of
return would be about 27% (Annex 14). Because of the diverse nature of the
Project, the economic rates of return would vary from 20% for the plantations
to more than 30% for the other facilities.



- 23 -
6.02      All costs and benefits have been valued at the post-devaluation
rate of TL 15.00 - US$1.00. To arrive at the economic rate of return, the
financial rates of return were adjusted by deleting taxes, adding costs of
technical services, and, for the ferry ships, adding back the rate reductions
to users. For the export handling facilities, the principal benefit would
be the increased value of exports due to proper handling -- assumed to be
US$20 per ton. A shadow rate for labor -- of 75% of the financial rate --
was used in the case of the on-farm citrus development to reflect the
existence of surplus labor in the Project area. If labor were costed at
100%, the rate of return for this part of the Project would decrease by less
than 1%.
6.03      In addition to the direct economic benefits, the Project would pro-
vide a number of indirect ones. The plantations would employ disease-free
stock and advanced production methods, providing an example for non-Project
farms. The packinghouses and improved export handling facilities and in-
spection procedures would provide a good foundation for subsequent vegetable
and fruit export ventures. The transport facilities would reduce foreign
exchange payments to foreign carriers. The Project would result, at full
development, in an increase in net export earnings, from about US$20 million
to about US$50 million per year. Government annual income tax receipts
would increase by about US$1.3 million. Finally, the Project would create
permanent employment for about 350 laborers and seasonal employment for about
4,500 laborers.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government on
the following principal points:
(a) it would promulgate an Export Regime requiring that all exports
of fresh fruit and vegetables go through packinghouses approved
by the Ministry of Commerce no later than January 1, 1975 and
that inspection programs be established to enforce quality
standards for products and packaging as set out by OECD and
the importing countries (para 3.14);
(b)  importation of seed and budwood recommended by the Project
Unit would be freely permitted and promptly arranged and that
only virus free certified budwood would be used in project
plantings (para 3.17);
(c) consultants, mutually acceptable to Government and Bank/IDA,
would be appointed by the Project Director under terms of
reference approved by Bank/IDA, and no subloans would be ap-
proved until the necessary feasibility studies had been pre-
pared and reviewed as set out in paragraph 3.18;



- 24 -
(d) the citrus budwood propagation farm would be established and
the research program would be approved by the Technical
Advisor for Plantations and Production (para 3.19); and
(e) the Special Operational Fund established in ABT would be used
for Project purposes and withdrawals from such fund
would be made only by the Project Director or his designated
representative (para 4.13).
7.02      During negotiatlons, assurances were obtained from ABT on the
following principal points:
(a) no orders would be placed for the ferry ships until the port
authorities at Koper or Trieste confirm their willingness
to make the necessary operating arrangements for the proposed
ferry ships (para 3.08) and until the Bank/IDA had approved
the subborrower and its management and overseas arrangements
(para 3.09); and
(b) subloans for transport and export handling facilities would
require technical approval by the Project Unit and would be
made under criteria specified, and all subloans over
US$250,000 would be approved by Bank/IDA (para 4.11).
7.03      Conditions of effectiveness of the loan/credit would be that:
(a) a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to Bank/IDA had
been executed, as described in paragraph 3.26;
(b) the Project Unit had been set up and the Project Director
and two Technical Advisors, mutually acceptable to Govern-
ment and Bank/IDA, had been appointed on terms and conditions
satisfactory to Bank/IDA (para 4.01);
(c) the Citrus Extension Unit had been established and that the
Director, mutually acceptable to Government and Bank/IDA,
had been appointed on terms and conditions satisfactory to
Bank/IDA (para 4.07); and
(d)  consultants mutually acceptable to Government and Bank/IDA
had been appointed to undertake the survey of agricultural
credit facilities, institutions and policies (para 3.20).
7.04      The Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$10 million for a
term of 20 years, including a five-year grace period, and an IDA credit of
US$15 million on IDA's standard terms.

TURKEY
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EXPORT PROJECT
Characteristics of Fruit and Vegetable
Production by Commodity and Region
1.        A great variety of fruits and vegetables is available in Turkey
throughout the year. Production areas located on the Mediterranean and
Aegean sea coasts provide vegetables and citrus fruits in winter months.
Grapes, apples, pears, some citrus fruits and potatoes are stored from
harvest in the fall until late winter and spring.
A. Fruits
2.        Table grapes, lemons, mandarins, grapefruit, peaches, and straw-
berries are the fruits most promising for export. Others with some poten-
tial are: plums, cherries, apricots, figs, and raspberries. Production
of Turkey's most important fruits is shown in Appendix 1-1.
3.        Grapes.  Grapes lead all fruit crops in production, with 3,725,000
tons in 1968.  They are grown in many parts of Turkey, usually on hillsides
on non-irrigated land with low yields, averaging about 4 tons per ha.
About 20% is used fresh, 35% as raisins, and 35% as a concentrated juice
or honey. About 3 to 5% of the production is used for wine.
4.        The annual production of grapes has increased by about a million
tons since 1964. An impetus was given for additional plantings when
considerable quantities of grapes were successfully exported in 1968 and
1969. Exports amounted to 5,255 tons in 1968 and increased to 19,000 tons
in 1969. Grapes were the early Tarsus variety and the midseason and
late varieties of Rosaki and Muskule.
5.        No export shipments were made after October, although grapes
are available on the local market in late fall and winter. Muskule grapes
from cold storage have been marketed in Turkey in January and February
but as yet have not been exported. Turkish grapes are not treated with
sulfur dioxide before storage to inhibit mold as is the common practice in
California, although trials are now underway at the Yalova station 11.
1/ Headquarters for and one of five research stations of UNDP/FAO Fruit
and Vegetable Project DP/SF 310 TUR 13, which began operating in
September 1966 under a three-year program and was recently extended
for an additional two years. This project conducts research and
training in viticulture, vegetable production, olive production,
marketing, coldstorage, citriculture and food processing.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
6.        Apples.  Apples, with a production of 700,000 tons in 1968, are
second to grapes as a fruit crop. Turkey produces excellent quality Starking
apples; nevertheless, they are not a promising export crop to the European
market because of the plentiful supply in Europe throughout the year, but
possibilities in the Middle East should be explored.
7.        Citrus.  The production of all kinds of citrus fruits amounted to
496,000 tons in 1969 with 27,000 ha of bearing orchards (roughly 24% of the
citrus area was not yet in bearing in 1969). Of this total, 16% was lemons,
13% was mandarins, 70% was oranges, and 1% was grapefruit. Production of
all citrus increased at an average of 6% a year between 1963 and 1969.
Production per ha is generally low, estimated at 20 tons per ha as an
average for all citrus groves. However, good groves of Washington navel
produce 35 tons per ha; Shamouti, 30 tons; lemons, 35 tons; and round
oranges, 50 tons.
8.        Turkish authorities are well aware that close control must be
exercised in the selection of budwood for citrus propagation and in the
use of rootstocks if serious virus diseases are to be controlled and
production of good quality fruit is to be maintained. Tristeza has not
been a problem in Turkey and efforts are being made to keep it out. The
Citrus Research Station in Antalya, established in 1935, devotes most of
its attention to virus diseases of citrus fruits while the Citrus
Institute at Mersin is responsible for advising growers on propagation
and cultural practices. Steps should be taken to overcome a serious
shortage of certified virus-free nursery stock and control the many small
private nurseries.
9.        Lemons.  Lemon production is limited to districts and micro-
climates that are virtually frost-free. The main center of lemon production
lies between Tarsus, Mersin, and Erdemli in Icel province, where about 80%
of the crop is produced. Only two varieties - Interdonato, an early
Italian variety, and Lamas, a high quality Turkish variety -- are exported
in quantity. Turkish lemons are attractive and have good juice content
and internal quality, and prospects for increasing exports are good.
10.       Exports begin late in August in normal years and reach their
maximum in September, October, and November. The harvest of the Interdonato
variety is heaviest in the Mersin area from August 15 to October 15. The
Lamas variety is harvested in the sme area from September 1 to December
30.
11.       Mandarins.  Mandarins (or tangerines as they are called in the
USA) include Satsuma, Clementine, and Willow Leaf. The provinces of Mugla,
Aydin and Izmir produce two-thirds of the crop and account for the bulk
of exports. Exports, mainly satsumas, started in 1963 and reached 28,000
tons (over 30% of the crop) in 1970.
12.       The export season is short, starting in October and ending in
December. Satsumas are picked when still partially green externally,

although the flesh is yellow colored. The exporter depends on the skin
yellowing during transport to market, but for uniformity modern degreening
methods should be used.
13.       Oranges.  Exact figures are not available but something over half
of the oranges are local varieties. In the important Adana and Antalya
regions, Washington navels and Shamonti comprise over 10% each, with
Valencias under 19%.
14.       The provinces of Antalya, Icel, and Adana produce more than 80%
of the oranges, with Icel and Antalya competing for first place. The
harvest season for the important export varieties are:
Adana                 Hatay                 Mersin
Washington navel    Nov. 1 to Feb. 28   Jan. 1 to Feb. 28   Dec. 1 to Jan. 30
Shamonti             Dec. 15 to Mar. 15  Feb. 1 to Feb. 28   Jan. 1 to Mar. 15
Valencia             Mar. 15 to Apr. 15  Apr. 1 to Apr. 30
Source: Basico Report - Stage 2.
Oranges have been exported from Turkey for many years, and Mersin is the
main port. Exports amounted to about 8,000 tons in 1969.
15.       Grapefruit.  Grapefruit production amounted to only 4,800 tons
in 1968, but it is on the increase. Icel province produces the most,
followed by Antalya, Adana, Hatay and Mugla. Exports in 1969 amounted to
2,500 tons, the largest amount going to West Germany in October and November.
16.       Peaches.  Peaches are a relatively new fruit for Turkey, with first
plantings made about the time of World War II. The first production of any
amount was in 1951 when 10,000 tons were harvested. The area under peaches
has increased moderately and in 1968 about 10% of the plantings were not
yet bearing. Yields vary from about 20 tons per ha for poorer orchards
to 50 tons for good orchards. Some frost damage occurs each year in the
main production areas of Bursa and Cannakale during the blossom period and
can reduce the crop by 25 to 50%.
17.       Strawberries.  In 1968, 2,000 ha were devoted to strawberry culture
and 8,000 tons were produced (Appendix 1-1). New plantings are being made
in the Adana area with a view to export. The Yalova Experiment Station has
imported virus-free varieties and is propagating them under isolation.
18.       Other Fruits.  Plums, sour cherries, apricots, figs, and raspberries
also have export potential. The most promising export possibilities are early
varieties from the southern areas which have a seasonal advantage.



ANNEX 1

B. Vegetables
19.       Ten vegetable and melon crops have definite export possibilities:
artichokes, asparagus, peppers, early potatoes, green beans, carrots,
tomatoes, onions, melons, and watermelons. Some possibilities also exist
for eggplant, celery, squash, lettuce, okra, and garlic, making a total of
16 vegetables to be considered. At the present time, there is no vegetable
export industry of any consequence. The production of some of the vegetables
listed for export is given in Appendix 1-2.
20.       Generally, the best export potential is for early varieties, and
this means production from Antalya or Adana/Mersin on the south coast.
Success in export of the early varieties would depend on (a) securing the
right disease-free varieties for early maturing and market tastes; and (b)
organizing the harvesting, packing, and transport for timely delivery to
market. Centralized packing stations where quality control can be exercised
are needed.

TUREKEY
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EXPORT PROJECT
Marketing Facilities For Export
Packing Plants
1.        Turkey's packing plants are generally old, ineffective and
underutilized. For all species, most production, whether for domestic
market or export, is packed in the field with minimum inspection. Conse-
quently, the quality of Turkey's pack is highly variable and often
inferior to those of competitors in export markets. Packing in the field
is popular because it is cheaper and results in less strict grading than
in a packinghouse.
2.        Lemons, Oranges, and Grapefruit.  The majority of production of
these species originates in the Cukurova region of Southern Turkey (covering
the provinces of Adana, Hatay and Icel). All of the fruit for domestic
sales and over 60% of that for export is field-packed. The remaining
exports are handled in two simple packinghouses in Mersin, both privately
owned. They operate on a custom basis, charging TL 7.00 per case of 14 kg
(about US$35 per m ton), including cost of the box. Their combined capacity
is about 25 tons of citrus per hour. A third packing plant with a capacity
of 9 tons per hour is being established in Antalya, some 260 km west.
3.        Harvest seasons for lemons, oranges, and grapefruit are as
follows:
Total Harvest Season       Most Intensive
Harvest Season
Lemons                  July to Mar.             Oct. to Dec.
Oranges                 Oct. to Apr.             Dec. to Feb.
Grapefruit              Nov. to Mar.             Nov. to Feb.
A well-organized plant can work on all three species for a 150-day season.
4.        Mandarins, Satsumas, and Clementines (soft-skinned oranges).
The satsuma area near Izmir in Western Turkey is the most important region
for these fruits. The harvest season is only about 60 days, starting in mid-
October. Currently, eight packing plants with a total capacity of about
50 tons per hour handle most of the exports. These are simple facilities,
consisting of sizing machines and sheds. The quality of the pack is due
more to the excellent local packinghouse labor than to the badly calibrated
sizing machines. Unlike the packing plants for lemons, oranges, and
grapefruit, plants for satsumas are owned and operated by exporters for use



ANNEX 2
Page 2
on their own product; little custom packing is practiced. Several of the
satsuma plants operate on a 24-hour basis during the peak season; others
do not because the talented labor on which they rely prefers a single
shift. In general, the plants do not wash and dry the fruit and do little
to control diseases, pests or damage. Also, they do not degreen the fruit
to improve the appearance for early market.
5.        Grapes.  Grapes, whether for domestic sale or export, are
entirely packed in the field and there is no fumigation of any kind. Almost
all exports are then loaded on refrigerated trucks. The general practice
is to start loading the trucks when they arrive in the field and use the
trucks' refrigeration units to chill the fruit. Since these units are
designed to maintain previously cooled products and not to chill warm
fruit, an adequate job of chilling is not possible. Consequently, fruit
often arrives at European markets with unacceptably high internal temperatures.
6.        Peaches.  One small packinghouse (with capacity of 9 tons per
hour) operates in the Bursa region. Otherwise, peaches are all field-
packed, also without any precooling.
7.        Vegetables. No vegetable packing plants operate in Turkey at
present.
Cold Storages
8.        Most of Turkey's cold storages are located in the major cities
(over half of the country's capacity is in Istanbul) in order to handle
the needs of the domestic markets. Almost all are for general frozen or
chilled products and often are not suited to storage of fruits. Where
storage suitable for fruit does exist, the charges are high, about TL 350
per ton (US$23/ton) for five months (including handling in and out). Some
fruit is stored for later sale on the domestic market but little is kept
for export.
9.        Caves about midway between Adana and Ankara can store about
20,000 tons of fruit. These can be prepared for about one-tenth the
capital cost of regular cold storages. Custom charges for cave storage are
only about TL 50 per ton, compared to TL 350 per ton for regular cold
storage. The caves are used mainly for lemons and apples for the domestic
market. Their location (365 ka from Mersin) and the lack of temperature
and humidity controls make them unsuitable for storage for export.
Packaging
10.       Most of Turkey's fruits and vegetables, whether for domestic use
or export, are packed in wooden boxes. Such boxes should continue to be an
adequate export package, provided steps are taken to (a) standardize sizes,
(b) control quality, and (c) use the stronger and more attractive poplar
instead of pine. The high cost of domestically produced kraft paper (about
twice the world price), which accounts for 80% of the cost of cartons,
makes cartons generally uncompetitive.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
11.       Wooden boxes are produced in over 1,000 small enterprises
throughout Turkey. Machines are used to saw logs into box lumber, but
the nailing is generally done by hand. The quality of box varies from bad
to excellent, depending on the type of wood used and the care of
worlkanaship. When rough wood (pine) is used or nails protrude, the fruit
may be damaged. There are no inforced standards of construction, with
the result that containers often do not stack well and space is utilized
badly.
12.       Three factories assemble boxes mechanically.  Private factories
in Izmit and Izmir produce poplar wood trays for grapes or satsumas, while
a new government factory in Antalya produces citrus boxes. The Antalya
factory has an annual one-shift capacity of 1.5 million boxes (enough for
22,500 tons of fruit).
Recommendations
13.       There is a need for facilities to handle the projected increase in
exports of about five packinghouses, four cold storages and 2 box factories.
Details of capacities and costs appear in Appendix 2-1.

TURKEY
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EXPORT PROJECT
Transport Infrastructure, Internal and Export
A. General
1.        The highway network in Turkey is well developed; paved roads
total some 16,000 km and the alignment and pavement conditions of the
main highways are reasonably good. Between 1960 and 1968, some 12,000
km of roads were upgraded to higher pavement standards and, in the same
period, road traffic in terms of professional carriers more than tripled,
increasing its share for passenger traffic from 69 to 86% and for freight
traffic from 43 to 71% (Appendix 3-1). Ports have been of major importance
in Turkey, with its more than 7,000 km of coastline.
2.        Railway construction, starting in the second half of the 19th
century, has linked the major cities of the country and extended the
service area of connected ports. Present lines total some 8,000 km in
length, but, due to geographical conditions and the fragmentary approach
to railway construction over the years, the connections between cities
have been made via basic junctions. As a consequence, the distances by
rail are generally greater than by road.
3.  -  -Air--transpert-ation within Turkey is largely carried out through
regular services by TKY (Turkish Airlines), connecting 18 cities. The
traffic increase since 1960 ran parallel to the increase for the trans-
port sector as a whole, so that its share remained unchanged.
B. Road Transport
4.        In 1968, national and provincial roads of an all-weather type
totalled about 48,000 km. Of these, one-third had an asphalt or concrete
pavement. Earth roads had a total length of 10,600 km. Construction and
maintenance of these roads are the responsibility of the General Director-
ate of Highways, an autonomous body under the Ministry of Public Works.
5.        At present, single-axle loads are limited to 8 tons, double-
axle loads to 14-1/2 tons. This also applies to vehicles employed by
foreign operators, but enforcement is lacking. Special permits can be
obtained to allow for higher axle load limits.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
6.        In freight traffic, there are only some 24 companies owning
more than 10 trucks. A law is being considered to regulate road transport
that would set requirements and control the number of operators through a
licensing system. Transportation of goods is largely in the hands of freight
forwarders and transport brokers. Only a few companies operate services
in a rational and organized way. Trucks are owned by a large number of small
operators who offer their services to the forwarders for various lengths of
time, and it is quite clear that the importance of freight forwarders and
brokers is a result of the lack of large transport companies providing nation-
wide services. Rates, both for passenger and freight transport, are unre-
gulated except for urban transport, where they are subject to approval by
the Ministry of Energy and National Resources.
7.        A system of minimum rates is to be introduced.  For transportation
of general cargo, the basic rate for a distance of 100 to 300 km would be
about TL 0.32 per ton-km (-2.2( equiv.) and for the same cargo hauled by
semi or full trailers, TL 0.22 (-1.5C equiv.).  The 1968 survey of the General
Directorate of Highways indicated an average actual rate of TL 0.24 per
ton-km.
8.        In 1967, there were 225,250 motorized vehicles in Turkey, of which
47% were passenger cars, 12% buses and minibuses, and 41% trucks and light
vans (Appendix 3-2). Between 1950 and 1960, the vehicle fleet increased
13.5% per annum, levelling off to 10.5% per annum for the period between
1960 and 1967. For trucks only, the figures were 11.5% and 6.8% respectively.
The average age of cars and trucks is nine years. This is, to some extent,
a result of the restrictions on imports.
9.        By the end of 1967, there were some 90,000 trucks in the
country, with a total load capacity of about 400,000 tons. The annual
mileage for trucks averaged 37,000 km in 1967. This is a low figure
and expresses the low utilization of old trucks (40% covers only 12,000-
15,000 km annually) on the one hand, and the seasonal limitation to the
employment of trucks on the other. Turkey is largely an agricultural
country and the haulage of foodstuffs is the major activity of many
operators. Even on an annual basis, the transportation of livestock and
agricultural products in 1967 accounted for 36% of total freight transport
by road.
10.       The type of truck commonly used within Turkey has an open top,
a single axle, and a loading capacity of 6-1/2 to 8 tons, which is
frequently exceeded up to 10 tons. These trucks are gasoline or diesel-
powered. Heavier trucks are almost exclusively of the semi-trailer type.
Most of the newer trucks have been assembled in the country.
11.       In international traffic, double-axle semi-trailers and
towing units are being used. Their loading capacity varies from 21 to
23 tons. Only a few companies are involved in international transportation.
Most of the trucks are refrigerated for the haulage of fish, meat, fruits
and vegetables. Services are irregular and include countries in Western
and Central Europe and the Middle East.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
12.       It is evident that international road transport is being
carried out by the larger operators only. They include the national meat
and fish organization, a government enterprise that also has its own
slaughterhouse and cold storage facilities; Frintas, a government-controlled
hauler, which started operations in 1969; and three or four private companies.
The whole fleet consists of about 180 units with a carrying capacity of
some 3,800 tons. Practically all of the equipment is imported and
maintenance operations are carried out largely by dealers.
13.       The need for trucks in international traffic, especially for
exporting fresh fruits, is further met by the use of foreign trucks,
mainly from Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary and Rumania. The majority of
these trucks hauls goods from Europe to Iran, using the Turkish export
products as return loads. Generally their service is good and rates are
quite reasonable.
14.       The quality and discipline of the drivers of the private companies
appear good and each truck covers 120,000 to 150,000 km per year, which is
satisfactory considering the seasonality of most of the exported goods.
15.       The strict import regime is seen by the private operators as a
limiting factor on long-term planning. It is doubtful whether used
vehicles can be replaced at a time that would guarantee an efficient operation.
Supply of spare parts is also insufficient, so that necessary repairs have
to be carried out abroad to a large extent.
16.       Mainly to facilitate the export of fresh fruits and vegetables,
the Government made arrangements for the procurement abroad of 130
refrigerated trailers and 50 tilt-type trailers, complemented by 130
towing units. As a result of difficulties with prospective private
operators who would participate in the operation of a newly established
road haulage company, the Government decided to recruit the required
staff from its own civil servants and to start operations in May 1969.
Frintas now employs about 260 drivers and 58 managerial and administrative
employees, including the maintenance section. Mainly due to insufficient
preparation, selection of qualified drivers and other employees was not
done carefully and, as a result, the quality is poor and the efficiency
of Frintas' operations has suffered greatly. Performance per truck is low
because of too long transit times and unbalanced utilization of the fleet
over the year.
17.       Steps are being taken to raise the quality of the drivers and
the staff members to ensure proper treatment and maintenance of the
equipment. Proper operations and maintenance can be achieved with the
help of outside management consultants, whose services have been acquired
through the International Executive Service Corps. Also, qualitative
improvement can be achieved by training programs for staff members,
preferably abroad, and by substituting the existing personnel by more
qualified people. Short-term improvement should be sought through the
hiring of young expatriate professionals who would be actively engaged in
direct operations.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
18.       Taxation on road transport comprises import duty and ad valorem
duties on imported items, annual taxes according to the type and weight
of the vehicle, fuel taxes, and registration fees. At importation through
ports, the following taxes and fees are charged: custom duty, production
tax, quay tax, stamp duty, and municipal tax, adding up to values varying
from 61% of the landed CIF value for chassis with engine to 180% for cars.
Engine spare parts are charged 70% in total. An estimated average for
other imported goods is 50%. Annual taxes on private vehicles vary with
weight and age of the vehicle. For cars 16 years old and more, the amount
is only 47 to 58% of the amount for new cars. Commercial vehicles are
only charged when they are 10 years old or more and the amounts are very
low. Taxation on gasoline adds up to 65% of the retail price, and to 56%
for diesel oil. These percentages are rather low compared to Western
European standards and, consequently, the retail prices for fuel (13w 1,er
liter for super, 9.54 for regular gasoline, and 84 for diesel oil)
are also relatively low.
19.       Revenues from road transport totaled TL 2.2 billion (US$151
million equivalent) in 1968. Estimates show that TL 1.3 billion (US$89.1
million equivalent) or 59%, can be considered specific taxes on road users,
which is fairly high. Total revenues in 1968 were 165% of current expen-
ditures on investment and maintenance on national and provincial roads
(TL 1.3 billion), including acquisition of land. In other words, revenues
from specific taxation covered current expenditures on the major road
network.
C. Railways
20.       The Turkish Railways (TCDD) are an autonomous state enterprise
under supervision of the Minister of Communications. Despite its autonomous
status, it would appear that TCDD lacks the means and the strength to
meet its financial and operational problems. Current deficits are rising
and are only partly compensated by Government contributions. As a result,
the gap has to be closed by borrowing and by irrational cutting down on
expenses. Thus, TCDD's service to its customers deteriorates, which makes
it even harder to compete with other means of transportation, especially
road transport. Services, especially freight services, are extremely
slow, and the rate system and rate level are such that the
use of railways is limited to certain goods and routes that are uninterest-
ing for road haulers. This is illustrated by the fact that only seven
categories of goods constitute 80% of the tonnage hauled.
21.       TCDD is in urgent need of financial assistance to renew part
of its track and rolling stock and of management advice to rationalize
its operations.  The official rates for fresh fruit, vegetables, meat            N
and fish are based on a ton-km price of about TL 0.087 or US$0.006 equivalent.
22.       Traffic with European countries tripled during the period 1960-
1968, although the total volume is modest: in 1968 about 18,000 carloads
arrived from Europe. Most of these were unloaded in the Istanbul area,



ANNEX 3
Page 5
although the introduction of two modern boats for the ferry services
across the Bosporus had a marked effect on the number of cars being
ferried. A new track is under construction in the European part of Turkey
to bypass the existing line, which crosses the Greek border several times.
It could be open to traffic in early 1971 and could have a noticeable
downward effect on transit time and rates.
23.       TCDD is a participant in the Interfrigo Organization, however
the use of Interfrigo wagons went down during the last 10 years, due to
the unreliability of transit time. The exporters complain that cars are
sidelined in various switching centers in the Balkans and delays have
made international rail an inadequate alternative for exports of fresh
fruit and vegetables.
D. Ports and Shipping
General
24.       Turkey has over 70 ports with regular commercial traffic.
These ports are situated along the Black Sea, Marmaran, Aegean and
Mediterranean coasts. Most of them are artificial and, on the whole,
of recent construction, with exception of the old port areas of Istanbul
(and Haydarpasa), Izmir and Iskenderun. Of these, seven are considered
to be major for international trade: Istanbul (and Haydarpasa), Izmir,
Samson, Trabzon, Mersin, Iskenderun, and Derince. Istanbul is the
commercial center of Turkey and its port handled, in 1969, approximately
40% of all international traffic (Appendix 3-3). Turkish ports have
serious shortcomings in equipment and storage capacity, and extension
works to improve the latter are being carried out. The Second Five-Year
Plan for 1968-72 allocates TL 621 million for harbor improvements.
Port Administration
25.       Government authority for ports is exercised through the Ministry
of Communications, which has a division dealing with ports and maritime
matters. This division has well-defined duties regarding maritime policies,
safety at sea, registration of vessels, status of seamen, control of
personnel and ship movements and collection of port dues.
26.       The Ministry of Public Works is in charge of construction
activities in the major and less important ports. The Ports and Railways
Department of the Ministry of Public Works prepares construction and
extension projects including costs and benefits evaluation; and sees to
execution of the works through contractors.
27.       Comparing the total revenue and cost of all the services,
port operations are run at a profit. However, some services such as
stevedoring and shorehandling are run at a loss, or very low profit,
while services such as storage and warehousing are run at a high profit.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
This indicates that operations are performed at a slow speed, productivity
in loading and unloading is too low, and storage time of goods is too
long. The annual tonnage of cargo handled per meter of available quay
compares unfavorably with averages in many European and North American
ports.
28.       The ports of Iskenderun, Mersin, Antalya, Izmir, Bandirma,
and Gemlik are best situated for export shipments of fresh fruit and
vegetables.
The Shipping Industry
29.       The Turkish merchant fleet is characterized by low average
tonnage, a high percentage of steam-driven vessels, and fairly antiquated
ships. Ships are owned by the two state enterprises, Denizyollari and
the Turkish Cargo Lines, and private shipowners. Denizyollari, which
is part of Denizcilik Bankasi, runs regular passenger services and has the
sole right to operate coastal passenger services with ships over 18
tons.
30.       The Turkish Cargo Lines, in which Denizcilik Bankasi has a majority
holding, operates services to foreign countries and handles the domestic
transport of coal, iron ore and oil, using ships over 300 tons. Private
shipowners use smaUer ships, their average tonnage being under 2,000
compared with approximately 4,000 tons for Denizyollari ships and
approximately 6,000 tons for ships of the Turkish Cargo Lines. The Turkish
Cargo Lines have embarked on a program for modernization and expansion of
their fleet, and are now studying the possibility of acquiring 17 new vessels
by 1975, 4,000 tons dead weight each, for carrying general cargo and 20 to
80 containers (20 ft), including refrigerated containers. They have no plans
for buying fast small container vessels or reefers, but are interested in
acquiring and operating ferry ships for use to southern Europe.
Shipbuilding and Ship Repair Facilities
31.       Turkish shipyards of major importance are controlled by
Denizeilik Bankasi. Most are of limited size and situated on cramped
premises. The yards in Istanbul at the Golden Horn are squeezed in
between the Galata and the Ataturk Bridges. The small scale of the
yards hampers to a great extent the adoption of modern techniques and
use of prefabricated parts. There is a large shipyard under construction
at Pendik, between Istanbul and Izmir, which is state-owned. According
to the Second Five-Year Plan, six or seven private yards should be built
in the same area.
32.       Bankasi operates a repair shipyard at Istinye, which accomplishes
about 70% of all repair work done in Turkey. On the Asian side of the
Bosporus is a private shipyard, Denizcilik Anonim Sirketi, which repairs
ships and can build new ones up to 150 ft long.



ANNEX 3
Page 7
E. Air Transport
33.       Civil aviation operations in Turkey consist mainly of (a) the
airline operations undertaken by the Turkish State Airline (THY), and
(b) the infrastructure operations undertaken by the Directorate General
of State Airports (DHMI). Both of these organizations are subject, in
various ways, to the regulation of their technical standards and financial
results by the Ministry of Communications, which has two departments
concerned with this regulatory work. One of these is the Civil Aviation
Department, responsible for all civil aviation safety; the other is the
Tariffs and Commerce Department, responsible for Ministry action on airline
tariffs.
34.       DHMI is responsible for two international airports, Yesilkoy near
Istanbul and Esenboga near Ankara. In addition, it is responsible for 23
domestic airports, eight of which are permanently closed, but still
looked after and maintained.
35.       The two international airports handle approximately two-thirds
of all aircraft movements. Two-thirds of the international movements
are carried out by foreign airlines. TRY operates all domestic flights in
Turkey and international flights to Rome, Paris, Zurich, Munich, Vienna,
Frankfurt, Brussels, and Amsterdam.
36.       At present, there is no major export of fresh fruits and vegetables
by air transport because of the expense. All production areas for these
items however, have a suitably situated airfield, which foreign airlines
are allowed to use, provided they do not carry passengers. THY is not active
in the field of air freight transportation internationally and have no effective
sales organization for freight promotion. There is only one foreign airline,
Pan American Airlines, which has a regular weekly cargo flight out of Ankara
and Istanbul to Western Europe.

FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EXPORT PROJECT
Agricultural Bank of Turkey
Background
1.        The Agricultural Bank of Turkey (ABT) is a semi-autonomous
government body responsible to the Ministry of Commerce. While its primary
objective is to extend credit for agricultural production to Turkish farmers,
it is also empowered to make credits to facilitate the marketing of farm
products and to promote the development of agricultural industries; to set
up, finance and participate in enterprises that support the agricultural
industry; to make credits to artisans; and to carry out agricultural devel-
opment projects. It may also engage in banking transactions and the insur-
ance of crops and cattle. ABT serves both private and public enterprise.
2.        ABT usually operates on its own authority according to the
Agricultural Bank Law. It may also act as agent of Government or any agency
in the execution of a specific lending program. The agricultural credit
cooperatives (ABT's main channel for extending short-term credit to farmers)
and the sales cooperatives and their unions (government instruments for
commodity, marketing and price supports) are under ABT control and super-
vision.
3.        Besides the Central Bank, there are 45 banks and financial
agencies in Turkey, including: 11 banks founded by special laws, 18 private
commercial banks operating all over Turkey, nine regional commercial banks,
five foreign commercial banks, and two investment banks -- the Industrial
Development Bank of Turkey and the Bank of Industrial Investment and Credit.
ABT accounts for about one-fourth of the total deposits of Turkey's banking
system and provides 99% of all loans to agriculture.
Organization - Staffing
4.        ABT's general policies and programs are reviewed and determined
every year by the High Regulating Board of Bank Credits, which consists
of the Ministers of Commerce (Chairman), Finance and Agriculture, the
Undersecretary of the State Planning Organization, and members of the Board
of Directors and management of ABT.
5.        ABT is adlministered by a board of six directors, composed of
the Chairman, appointed by a Decree of the Council of Ministers and ratified
by the President of the Republic; three government appointees; one elected
by the agricultural credit cooperatives; and the General Director. The board
defines basic ART operating policies. It examines and sanctions proposals
made by the management on such matters as rates of interest and commissions,



ANNEX 4
Page 2
measures aimed at increasing resources, the program of general operations and
investments, participation, applications for credits over TL 150,000, write-
offs of bad debts, and annual budRet halance sheets and business reports.
6.        The General Director is the chief executive, assisted by a
Secretary General and four Assistant General Directors. Bank personnel
numbers over 17,000, including about 200 agriculturalists. Each Assistant
General Director and the Secretary General are in charge of several of the
25 divisions making up the head office (Appendix 4-1). Divisional chiefs
at head office may approve loans up to TI. 150,000 (US$10,000), but greater
amounts require board approval.
7.        ABT's 750 branches achieve a very dense coverage of the country,
with concentration, however, in the richer agricultural areas.  In addition,
ABT contributes and provides credit support to some 2,000 agricultural
cooperatives, with a total membership of about 1,300,000. Each province
of the Project area has a branch of ART and four to eight credit cooperatives.
Branches may approve loans ranging between TL 10,000 (US$666) and TL 100,000
(US$6,600), according to their status and performance.
The Project Loans Department
8.        The Project Loans Department, headed by the Secretary General,
was established in 1969 and includes the Encouragement and Development
Loans Division, the Supervised Agricultural Loans Division and the Projects
Bureau (Appendix 4-2). The department was created mainly to carry out
special programs and handle related funds that have originated from govern-
ment contributions, foreign lending agencies, Central Bank advances, the
Special Export Fund, and its own funds.
9.        The management of the Encouragement and Development Loans
Division comprises a Director and two deputies. There are four subdivisions,
namely Agricultural Projects, Agro-Industry Projects, Research and Statistics,
and Personnel. Total Central Office staff is 21. It administers various
special programs and funds for agricultural development, particularly in
livestock, agro-industries, transport and storage, chemicals, and export
promotion credits. As of December 31, 1969, the division controlled opera-
tions involving about TL 210 million of credits granted.
10.       The Supervised Agricultural Loans Division handles the ABT
supervised and Topraksu credit programs. The Projects Bureau, which currently
has less than half of the 100 agricultural technicians and engineers autho-
rized, prepares farm development and loan plans; supervises their implemen-
tation; and cooperates with, and coordinates the services of, extension and
technical agencies for the benefit of Project farms.
Auditing and Supervision
11.       As a State economic enterprise, ABT is subject to the control of
a mixed congressional commission reporting to Parliament and the supervision
of a High Control Board reporting to the Prime Minister. As a bank, ABT
is also supervised by auditors of the Ministry of Finance who insure that



ANNEX 4
Page 3
banks conform to the provisions of the banking law. In addition, the bank
has its own system of internal auditing and supervision, which consists of
two specialized groups: a bank audit group with staff of 127 and a coopera-
tive audit group with a staff of 137. The groups supervise the bank service
branches and cooperatives at least once a year and report directly to the
management.
Loan Appraisal Techniques
12.       Appraisal of agricultural loans consists primarily of an
assessment of the value of the collateral offered by the borrower and his
past repayment record. Investment loans, such as for orchard establishment
and animal husbandry, would be referred to the local agents of the Ministry
of Agriculture for opinion and guidance. These agents play an important
role in determining farmers' short-term credit requirements. The field
technicians actually check farmers' request for loans in kind, such as seeds,
chemicals, fertilizers and animal feeds. For medium- and long-term borrowers,
they may assist in working out loan projects and supervise the implementation
in liaison with the branch of the bank. Forms for various types of invest-
ment loans are signed by the local representatives of the agricultural
services and the representative of the branch. The forms, properly filled
out, give adequate basic data and information to make loan decisions.
Terms and Conditions of Loans
13.       All Turkish farmers are eligible for ABT loans.  There are
ceilings to amounts that can be given to a single farmer or for a
specific project but loans in exess of ceilings can be made. Amounts are
usually granted on the basis of predetermined cost estimates of investments,
in the case of medium- and long-term loans, and a portion of standard esti-
mated overating costs or unit prices of crops in the case of short-term
loans for production or marketing. Loans for raising productivity and
those under supervised credit programs and, in general, under special funds,
are based on field appraisals and cost estimates.
14.       ABT's general policy is to require the borrower to contribute not
less than 30% of costs estimated. ABT's security requirements, even for
short-term loans, are usually a first mortgage, sometimes in addition to
guarantors. Generally, loans may not exceed 70% of the value of the lands
offered as guarantee. Some specific types of loans, such as supervised
credit loans up to TL 25,000, tractor purchases up to TL 40,000, and equip-
ment loans up to TL 20,000, may be exempt from mortgage security.
15.       Short-term loans are usually for one year but postponements and
renewals are frequently granted. Terms of loans for equipment, farm
machinery, and livestock are up to five years, without grace periods. Long-
term loans may be up to 20 years, with grace periods up to seven years.
16.       ABT charges different rates of interest for different loan
categories (Annex 5), but since the monetary reform of August 1970, standard
rates of agricultural loans are 10-1/2%, irrespective of term. Rebates of



ANNEX 4
Page 4
1-1/2% are made to borrowers by Government for direct loans from the bank
and 2% on loans made through cooperatives. In each case, the bank receives
a premium of 1.3%. A supervision commission of 0.5% is charged by the bank.
Therefore, the effective rate paid by farmers is 9-1/2% per annum.
Terms and Conditions of Loans Made for Establishment of Orchard Plantations
and Nurseries
17.       ABT has been making loans currently to orchard crop growers for
working capital and for raising the productivity of existing orchards and
establishing new ones. In 1969, ABT issued 4,660 short-term loans (TL 19.9
million) and 171 investment loans (TL 1.1 million) to citrus growers to plant
114 ha. As of the end of 1969, loans to citrus growers outstanding numbered
4,521 (TL 20.2 million), 3,707 of which were short-term loans for TL 18.9
million and 814 were investment loans for TL 1.3 million. Because of
shortage of resources, ART has restricted its lendings to the plantation of
orchards of less than 5 ha for pistachio and citrus and less than 3 ha for
other fruits. The amounts lent are small in relation to total costs and
farmers are hard pressed to provide additional contribution required.
Maximum loans per ha and phasing of disbursements have been worked out on
the basis of information obtained from various sources, including the
Ministry of Agriculture and research stations.
18.       Terms provide for a grace period of six to seven years for
payment of principal and interest. The repayment period is four years for
the total loan and capitalized interest up to the ultimate maturity date
and should be made in installments of 10, 20, 30, and 40% for the 1st, 2nd,
3rd, and 4th year, respectively. These terms are realistic. The amounts
lent for nursery plantations are also inadequate and carry similar terms:
eight years, including a grace period of four years for repayment of prin-
cipal and interest.
Activities of ABT
19.       As of December 31, 1969, agricultural and commercial loans
outstanding represented 80% and 20%, respectively, of the total loan
portfolio. Over recent years, the proportion of agricultural loans has
tended to grow as a result of a general increase in operations for all types
of loans and, to some extent, an accumulation of overdue agricultural loans.
As of December 31, 1969, agricultural loans outstanding amounted to TL 9,709
million, about three times the amount as of December 31, 1965. In 1969,
ABT issued new agricultural loans in the amount of TL 7,151 million against
TL 5,089 million in 1965.
20.       Short-term loans (Appendix 4-3) represent about 70% of the total
loan portfolio and medium- and long-term loans about 12%, with overdue,
adjusted and bad loans making up the balance. Short-term loans are made to
agricultural credit cooperatives to be on-lent to farmers. The short-term
loans are intended to provide working capital for crop and livestock product-
ion. Short-terms loans are also made for the financing of the price support



ANNEX 4
Page 5
purchases of sales cooperatives and their unions. Medium- and long-term
loans supply farmers with funds for a variety of on-farm investments (Annex
4-3).
21.       ABT's resources doubled over the five-year period ending
December 31, 1969 to reach an all-time record of TL 16,764 million. Resources
are derived mostly from deposits (about 51%) and rediscounts and advances
of the Central Bank (25%). Deposits originate from the public and from
government agencies. ABT is the first beneficiary among the banks of the
rediscount facilities of the Central Bank, which finance most of ABT's lending
operations to credit and sales cooperatives. Capital and reserves provided
only about 10%, a figure that has been declining in recent years. Payments
of authorized capital by Government have been constantly postponed or
curtailed, and nominal profits have prevented the build-up of significant
reserves and provisions. Specialized funds from AID, Central Bank, and
Treasury assigned to various lending programs account for only 3% of all
resources.
22.       The balance sheet (Appendix 4-4) reveals the pattern of ABT's
use of resources. The proportion of liquid assets to all assets (13.9%)
is high because of the legal liquidity requirements for deposits and the
great number of branches that must keep adequate cash for their current
operations.
23.       The overall cost of ABT's resources has been estimated at 5.92%
in 1969 against about 5.70% in 1968 and 5.59% in 1967. Such costs are higher
than those of most other banks founded by special laws, but lower than those
of the private banks. In 1969, the average cost of funds received from
deposits was about 6.25%, including interest at 3.08% and a share in adminis-
trative expenses at 3.17%.
24.       Earning Records.  Profits of the bank have been nominal for a
number of years and are steadily decreasing, as shown in the profit and
loss accounts (Appendix 4-5). This is the result of heavy administrative
expenses, inadequate interest rates and commissions, and an important
proportion of unproductive assets. In fact, in 1969, the output of assets
(5.73%) was inferior by 0.19% to the cost of liabilities (5.92%). Still,
necessary provisions against bad debts were not accounted for. New rates
and subsidies now in force should improve this situation.
Collection Records of Agricultural Loans
25.       The hank's collection record has deteriorated markedly over
recent years, particularly in agricultural loans, for which collection
rates are recorded in the following percentage table:

26.       As of December 31, 1969, delinquent loans amounted to about
TL 1,153 million 1/ (Appendix 4-6). Total delinquent loans account for about
6.7% of assets, 10.5% of loans outstanding, and 88% of the aggregate amounts
of the paid-in capital, reserves and provisions. Delinquent agricultural
loans amount to TL 848 million 2/, about 8.7% of all agricultural loans
including short-term loans made to the semi,-government sales cooperatives
in the amount of TL 269 million, or about 2.. 7% of all agricultural loans.
Defaulted loans vary by region and the collection records of branches in
the Project area are comparatively satisfactory.

Interest Rates
1.        The measures taken in connection with the devaluation of
August 7, 1970 include an upward revisibn of legal maximum interest rates
on deposits and loans and of discount rates of the Central Bank. New rates,
compared with rates that had been in force since 1961, are given in Ap-
pendix 5-1 and 5-2. Interest on six-month to one-year deposits has been
raised by 1X to 6%, and those deposits over one year and 18 months by 31
and 2.5%, respectively, to 9% per annum. This measure is expected to
attract new deposits of funds otherwise used in the unorganized money
market, and to cause a switch from demand to time deposits. Such develop-
ments would permit an expansion in bank lending, with some shift to longer-
term loans.
2.        The current discount rate has been raised from 7.5% to 9.0., but
preferential rates, for instance, for agricultural bills, are 7.5%, compared
with 5.25% before the monetary measures. Most rates of interest on loans
have also been increased. Standard maximum rates of commercial loans and
agricultural loans are now 11.5% and 10.5%, respectively, as against 10.5%
and 9%. The reform would be a first step in reducing the gap between rates
of financial institutions and the economic rates that may, at present, be
estimated at 18%. The new rates compensate for the higher rates that can
be given to deposits. Additionally, higher rates, allowed for medium-
term credits, provide an incentive to banks to shift to this type of credit.
3.        The rates of interest have been increased with regard to the
lending agencies, and reduced with regard to borrowers for priority pur-
poses, through a system of premiums to the lenders and interest refunds to
borrowers. The interest differences to be paid to lending agencies and
borrowers are shown in paragraph 4. They are aimed at encouraging bank
lending to some sectors given priority and at mobilizing the bank resources;

TURKEY
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EXPORT PROJECT
Transportation Analysis and Recommendations
A. Present Situation
1.        At present, fresh fruits and vegetables are exported from the
production areas in various ways. Selection of the way is only slightly
dependent on differences in transportation cost, since many other factors
must be considered in order to have a marketable product at the point of
sale. One such factor is time. A short transit time under controlled tem-
perature is often required to preserve the quality of fruits. As an
example, fresh grapes, which have to be kept at a constant temperature
during transportation, can be marketed in Western Europe only through the
use of refrigerated trucks.  Another important factor is often the lot size
of the shipment, considering the amount of produce that a market can
absorb at one time without a severe drop in market price.
2.        In general, Turkey ships fruit according to the following pattern:
(a)  Oranges and lemons are transported by ventilated ships.
Rates to Western European ports range from US$20 per ton,
charged by Turkish Cargo Lines (TCL), to US$30 per ton,
charged by foreign companies. The difference in price is
mainly for a difference in quality of service.
(b) Mandarins and satsumas are generally hauled by truck be-
cause of the shorter transit time required.
(c) Grapes are hauled by refrigerated trucks, providing rela-
tively cheap and fast door-to-door service. Trucking
rates quoted by Frintas and by foreign operators are given
in Appendix 6-1. Interfrigo rail services are sometimes
used, mainly to Vienna and Zurich, to meet the demand of
chain store customers who have railway connections to their
warehouse. The railway rate from Bursa to Munich is US$65
per ton. In general, truck transport is preferred, since
it is faster and cheaper.
(d) Peaches are hauled by truck, rail, and by refrigerated
ships in combination with grapes. Rates of US$50 per ton
are quoted for chartered reefers, the lot sizes being 300
to 400 tons. Such a rate reflects the inefficiency of
loading operations in Turkish ports, where it takes up to



ANNEX 6
Page 2
four days to handle this volume. This problem is largely
caused by the absence of precooling and storage facilities.
(e) Some early varieties of high value fruits are shipped by
air to take advantage of the temporary elevated prices in
the markets.  The official rate is about USB28 per kg.
3.        Most of the trucks engaged in exporting fruits and vegetables
are refrigerated to meet the requirements of the produce and most are
loaded in the field. Due to the general absence or the non-use of precool-
ing facilities, the required temperature has to be reached by using the
trucks' cooling system. To speed up loading operations, truckers prefer
to load early in the morning when temperatures are lowest. Time required
averages six hours.
4.        On their way to Europe, trucks have to cross the Bosporus by
ferry (TL 400 per truckload fare). Waiting time may be as much as three
days and delays at the frontiers are sometimes unnecessarily long. Transit
times from Istanbul to Europe vary from 2-1/2 days minimum to Vienna, to
nine days maximum to Stockholm. The preferred route is through Bulgaria and
Yugoslavia to Austria, but, to escape the higher taxation in Yugoslavia,
truckers also use the route through Bulgaria and Hungary.
5.        It would appear that rates charged by foreign ships could be
lowered if loading operations in the Turkish ports could be speeded up.
The trucking rates charged by Bulgarian operators declined in 1970 as a
result of lower rates charged by Frintas (Appendix 6-1).
B. Transport Demand
6.        In 1970, Turkish exports of fresh fruit and vegetables totaled
about 100,000 tons 60% of which went to Western Europe. While the increase
in exports is difficult to predict the feasibility study by TUMAS (para 1.03)
has shown a projection of 500,000 tons of all fruit and vegetable by 1975
(of which about 400,000 tons is made up of four principal products: citrus,
grapes, onions and potatoes), some 200,000 tons being preferably transported
by ferry ship trailers. These tonnage are, of course, seasonal in that
three months (January, February and March) are projected to produce only
about 4,500 tons per month (monthly capacity of the ferry ships would be
about 10,000 tons); however, all other months show tonnages which are well
over the capacity of the ferry ships (Appendix 6-2).
7.        The same TUMAS feasibility study shows potential ferry ship
export cargo for other than fruit and vegetables. These include much
products as processed and dried fruits, nuts, olives, meat, fish and fibers.
The projections show a total non-fruit and vegetable tonnage in 1975 of
about 200,000 tons and about 12,000 tons per month in January, February and



ANNEX 6
Page 3
March. Estimated total cargo would be about 17,000 tons in each of these
months or about 170% of ferryship capacity. The same trailers could be used
for this other cargo but where refrigeration is not required, lower rates
would be charged to attract this traffic.
C. Analysis and Recommendations
8.        The analysis and recommendations presented in the following para-
graphs are made on the basis of actual rates charged for present modes of
transport and on cost calculations made by TUMAS (Turkish consultants) and the
mission. They also take into consideration the other factors mentioned in
paragraph 1.
9.        Fruits and vegetables that can be transported by conventional
ventilated ships should continue to be shipped by this means, which is the
cheapest. However, fruits and vegetables that are highly perishable, or
those going to markets where only a limited (small) tonnage can be sold at
a time or to markets situated far inland from seaports, should use a more
specialized mode of transport. Use of container vessels, ferry ships and
refrigerated vessels has been considered and the following points are noted:
(a) Container Vessels. These vessels can carry fresh fruit and
vegetables in non-refrigerated and refrigerated containers
although, in ports, special facilities are required to handle
the containers. Preferably all markets, as well as all load-
ing points (packinghouses, cold stores), should have such
facilities.
(b) Ferry Ships. These vessels can carry any kind of road
trailer, refrigerated and non-refrigerated, and can also
carry containers on a trailer. They require only a special
loading/discharging berth in their ports of call. Appendix
6-3 has details on recommended ship characteristics.
(c) Refrigerated Ships. These ships can carry any kind of fresh
fruit or vegetable requiring refrigerated transport. The
optimum size vessel for export of Turkish fresh fruit and
vegetables is about 1,000 tons. These vessels should be
used only for transportation to suitable markets (near a
seaport) that can handle a large quantity of fresh fruit and
vegetables at a time.
10.       The use of containers has not been considered appropriate for the
export of Turkish fresh fruit and vegetables for the following reasons: (a)
projected tonnages of fresh fruit and vegetable exports do not justify the
investments required; (b) the container system is not so flexible as the
trailer svstem; and (c) markets for Turkish fresh fruits and vegetables
are not prepared to handle containers. Refrigerated ships are too slow for
much of the tonnages and require double handling and storage at the ports
and therefore are not suitable for Turkish conditions.



ANNEX 6
Page 4
11.       Specified costs of trailer operation in combination with ferry
ships are given in Appendix 6-4. Calculations were made for transport cost
per ton between the major fruit and vegetable production areas to Trieste,
considering the alternative use of the ports of Izmir, Mersin, and Gemlik.
The different outputs of the areas concerned were taken into account.
Moreover, a correction was made in the average cost per ton-km, considering
cost differences related to varying lengths of haulage. The turn-around
time of trailers was based on calculations made by the TUMAS consultants,
which indicated that the use of the port of Izmir would give the lowest cost
per ton.
12.       The cost of towage between Trieste/Koper and the European markets
was estimated at TL 4.54 per km. In establishing the cost per ton of cargo,
allowance was made for "empty" kilometers, covering travel to the points of
loading return cargo, and for foreign taxes. A load of 18 tons to Europe
and 11 tons for return cargo to Turkey was used in establishing the total
cost per ton between the production areas and the markets. The ratios were
established on the basis of studies by the TUMAS consultants and they ap-
pear realistic. The costs per ton for a few overseas markets are given in
Appendix 6-5 and they compare favorably with present overland trucking costs
(Appendix 6-6). The transit time to the European markets by ferry ships
would be the same or somewhat longer than by truck. For these reasons, the
proposed ferry ship system appears favorable.
13.       Based on the TUMAS consultants' study, the State Planning Organi-
zation (SPO) proposed financing the following transportation capacity:
1972   1973   1974   1975
Ferry ships                  5      6       7        8
Towing units               635    752    861       981
Refrigerated trailers      715    847    967    1,057
Canvas-covered trailers   305    363    415        466
There are a number of factors involved, however, that suggest that a some-
what less ambitious plan might be more prudent, at least at this time.
Some examples of this are as follows:
(a)  the distribution of exported fresh fruit and vegetables
over the different modes of transport has a complex and
not clearly defined pattern, making it very difficult
to calculate realistically exact capacities required for
each mode;
(b) capacities in the SPO proposal have been calculated on
the basis of the projected export potential of Turkish
fresh fruits and vegetables over the years 1972-75. These
projections were made by BASICO (German consultants)
and TUNIAS and accepted by the Mission. However, many fac-
tors could influence these projections;



ANNEX 6
Page 5
(c) to utilize the proposed transportation system properly,
the infrastructure of the fresh fruits and vegetables export
industry must be developed and improved considerably;
(d) investments required for the proposed transportation system
are high compared to the total investment needs of the
Turkey Fruit and Vegetable Export Marketing Proj-
ect; and
(e) the proposed transportation system requires specialized
and experienced people in managerial and operational posi-
tions.
14.       Therefore, it is recommended that only a limited investment in a
new transportation system be made, thus reducing the risks involved. The
initial transport system should include two ferry ships and a corresponding
number of trailers (385) and towing units (100).
15.       This system would provide an annual capacity of 110,000 tons one-
way, which compares with projected export tonnages of all types suitable for
ferry ship operations of 420,000 by 1972 and 799,000 by 1975. Considering
the lower transport cost involved and the seasonal variation, it is reason-
able to expect that the system would be fully utilized under all circumstances.
The ferry ships should be on a regular weekly service between Izmir and a North
Adriatic port (Appendix 6-7). In paragraph 9, it was-indicated that Izmir
is the optimum port for the operations and its use would result in a better
sailing schedule because the shorter sea voyage to Trieste/Koper leaves more
time to keep scheduled sailings.
16.       The decision as to which North Adriatic port should be used must
be made by the companies participating in the combined transportation sys-
tem. Both Trieste (Italy) and Koper (Yugoslavia) are suitable because of
their geographic position, road links with Central and Western Europe, port
layout, and port facilities. Both ports are under management of a port
authority. In Koper, however, the port authority is autonomous and in charge
of all facilities and services, whereas in Trieste, it is very much dependent
on Government policies and decisions and is in charge of only part of the
port facilities and services. Furthermore, the possibilities of making
satisfactory arrangements with European operators for towing the trailers in
Europe seem greater in Koper than in Trieste.
D. Management and Operation
17.       A ferry ship transportation system would mean a completely new
mode of transport for Turkey. This sea system, like the conventional modes
of transport, needs supporting services, such as those from a maritime/nau-
tical department for crew and supplies, and those from a technical depart-
ment for arranging intermediate repairs, surveys and dry-docking, and the



ANNEX 6
Page 6
like. The ownership participation of existing maritime operators is there-
fore essential.
18.       The Government has not yet decided whether the sub-borrower should
be the State-owned Turkish Cargo Lines (TCL) or an existing privately-owned
shipping company or a consortium of shipping companies (perhaps also involv-
ing TCL); any of which might be satisfactory provided that, in all but the
first alternative, suitable management arrangements were made with TCL (the
only Turkish enterprise with extensive ferry ship operating experience) or
a foreign ferry ship operator.
19.       Sailing schedules have to be made up well in advance, preferably
before the start of a season (year), and they must be published and advanced
to all transport companies that might be interested in using the ferry serv-
ices. Sailings must be such that exports, especially of fresh fruits and
vegetables, can reach the most faraway markets on a suitable market day.
If, when starting the services, no fully competent and qualified Turkish
personnel can be found for the executive positions, foreign professionals
should be hired for executing the key services.
Trailer and Towing Services
20.       The nature of commercial operation of ferry ships is something
with which ship operators are less familiar. It provides door-to-door
service equal to road transport and has, therefore, generally been devel-
oped by companies in the field of trucking, freight-forwarding, and freight-
handling. Considering Turkish conditions, it is recommended that the opera-
tion of ferry ships and towing units be brought under control of a limited
number of private companies currently active in these fields. The proposed
ferry ship operation requires that maximum attention be given to full utili-
zation of the trailers in both directions throughout the year.
21.       Prospective companies should be selected by the Project Manager,
advised by outside consultants. The selected companies should in no way
be limited in their commercial activities by Government, and the equipment
should be made available to them, net of import duty and other taxes.
Special attention should be given by the Agricultural Bank of Turkey, the
proposed Project Manager and Rank/IDA, to the terms on which the loan/credit
would be made available to the companies, especially in regard to collateral
usually required by Turkish banks.
22.       The operation of the proposed number of trailers by several com-
panies would introduce a necessary element of competition among the com-
panies. This is essential because, while on the one hand the ferry ship
operation would allow lower rates than the present truck rates, the proposed
number of trailers may, on the other hand, appear insufficient to move all
the relevant produce the exporters would offer.
23.       To further secure maximum utilization of the ferry ships, especial-
ly with a view to return cargo to Turkey, it would be necessary for the
companies to appoint agents in the overseas countries or build up sufficient
connections. Moreover, they must make arrangements with operators in Italy,



ANNEX 6
Page 7
Yugoslavia, Austria, or the Federal Republic of Germany for towing trailers
from the port to the markets and back.
24.       International road transport in Europe is subject to bilateral
arrangements on governmental level, establishing, among other things, the
number of vehicles allowed to enter a country in a given time period, or
the number of trips to be made.  When loaded trailers, not accompanied by a
corresponding towing unit, are landed in a foreign country, the transporta-
tion between the port of entry and the country of destination is not consi-
dered transit traffic, but bilateral traffic between these two countries.
As a rule, towing ferry trailers is permitted only to operators from the
country of port of entry and the country of destination as well as to opera-
tors from the countries to be traversed. It is not impossible, though
unlikely, that the Italian or Yugoslavian Government would allow Turkish
operators to perform the towage between the port of entry and the markets
by themselves. This possibility should be investigated by the Turkish
authorities. The proposed number of towing units in the Project would be
fully required, however, for towage services within Turkey.
25.       It may be necessary for some of the prospective companies to seek
the assistance of outside consultants and the knowledge of experienced
expatriate personnel.  It is, therefore, recommended that an outside con-
sulting firm be engaged to do the following:
(a) develop adequate detailed plans and recommendations for
management and the operational department to ensure effi-
ciency in all trailer handling, documentation, planning
and coordination procedures, and equipment maintenance
and utilization;
(b) develop a plan for proper training of low-, middle-, and
high-level supervisory personnel and execute training
programs; and
(c) advise management on setting up a network of agents in all
countries where return traffic for the ferry trailer
services can be attracted.

North Adriatic Ports
Koper
1.        The port of Koper is in North Yugoslavia about 20 km from the
border with Italy. It is the newest port in Yugoslavia and still under
construction. It has general cargo quays, a quay for handling bulk cargoes,
and a facility for tankers. Maximum depth at present is 10 m but this will
be increased to depths ranging between 14 and 18 m.
2.        The port has specialized in handling fresh fruit and vegetables
and frozen goods and has cold storage facilities (capacity 3,900 m2), re-
frigerated stores (capacity 6,000 ml), and fumigation rooms (capacity 600
m3). In addition, there are facilities for sorting, packing, grading, and
quality control. A facility for handling Ro-Ro ferries will be constructed
in 1971.
3.        The port of Koper is connected with the Yugoslavian (European)
railway system, but road connections with the hinterland are not good. In
1972, however, a new highway will link Koper with Klagenfurt, via Ljubljana.
4.        Shipping lines calling at Koper trade to Hediterranean ports,
ports in the Near and Middle East, North Europe, North and South Africa,
North and South America, and Australia.
Trieste
5.        The port of Trieste is in North Italy, next to the border with
Yugoslavia. Management and operations are carried out by a Port Authority.
The port area, which is facing the open sea, is divided into various zones
and has depths between 10 and 16 m. Two of these zones make up the commer-
cial port, which is used for transit traffic with the Italian and foreign
hinterland.
6.        The port is experienced in handling general cargo and also has
experience in handling fresh fruit and vegetables, which consist mostly of
citrus. There are facilities for sorting, packing, grading, and quality
control, as well as a cold storage with 30 compartments and a capacity of
3,700 tons. Fumigation plants and cells for ripening of fruits are avail-
able outside the port area. These are owned and run by private firms. A
facility for handling Ro-Ro ferries is not available, but could be con-
structed.

7.        The port of Trieste is connected with the Italian (European)
railway system and road connections with the hinterland are fairly good.
A new highway, Trieste-Palmanova-Venice, will connect the city, via its
branch to Udine, with the projected Udine-Tarnisio road.

Fruit and Vegetable Export Program and Trade Restrictions
A. Export Situation
Background
1.        Turkey for many years exported fresh fruit and vegetables to
Europe, but these exports have been sporadic, showing either stagnation or
decreases between the early 1950's and 1965. Thereafter, an upward trend
developed, as shown in the following table:

tracting Company, Market and Transportation Study

Ankara (1970).
2.        The dramatic increase in exports in 1969 was the result of sev-
eral actions on the part of Government (particularly the State Planning
Organization (SPO)). These included: (a) arranging financing for and
importation of 150 refrigerated trucks, 130 to be owned and operated by
Frintas, a mixed-ownership company sponsored by Government; (b) establish-
ing an Export Regime, which granted a tax rebate (in the form of a differ-
ential exchange rate) to exporters of fruit and vegetables handling minimum
quantities; (c) organizing four new private exporting companies owned pri-
marily by producers for the purpose of organizing exports; and (d) granting
low interest rate, short-term loans to exporters on the basis of the ex-
porter's annual export program filed with SPO.
The Five-Year Plan
3.        The Five-Year Plan 1968-1972 aimed at a 69% increase in the ex-
port volume of fresh fruits and vegetables. This goal was achieved in 1969

tials for fruit and vegetable export expansion:

The Marketing Structure for Export
5.        Before 1969, the Turkish export of fruit and vegetables was in
the hands of more thaL 140 private traders, all acting independently.
Importing countriea and' Turkisb consular officers reported periodic over-
supply in. various markets., poor standardization,, and bad packaging. These
factors accounted for the lower prices obtained for Turkish products in
Western European markets, compared with those of competing Mediterranean
countries. Furthermore, between 1963 and 1968, Turkish exports of fruit and
vegetables to Western European countries decreased steadily in the face of

competition from better organized countries marketing similar, but better
presented, products, but increased to Eastern European countries.
The Production Companies
6.        During 1969, five new export companies came into being as a result
of efforts by the Turkish Government. The device used was confinement of
various fiscal advantages to exporting groups achieving an export turnover
exceeding certain minimum volumes. These firms are situated in the chief
production areas.
7.        Many smaller exporters, particularly in Istanbul (where there is
no consolidated production company) and Izmir, have chosen to remain out-
side the companies, apparently from the desire to remain "independent" or
because of a real technical difficulty as in the case of exporters with a
"mixed" export business. The Government, however, refuses to assist these
small exporters since the main objective of the scheme is to group fruit
and vegetable exporters to achieve specialization and coherence in market-
ing arrangements.
8.        Simultaneously, the newi production companies were encouraged to
provide capital for a Central Marketing Organization (MEPA). This company
is now in existence with a subscribed capital of TL 1.6 million, subscribed
to by the six largest fruit and vegetable exporters, plus a large Govern-
ment-backed trucking company and a refrigeration company. In practice, the
concentration of 80% of the country's fresh fruit and vegetable exports
into six hands has undoubtedly brought a degree of consolidation to the
commerce and has assisted in achieving some standardization and bulk dis-
patches, as well as sales to and by the foreign importer.
9.        Much more needs to be done in presentation.  The packaging and
grading of Turkish citrus at present lags far behind that of competing
Mediterranean countries. This is reflected in the low export market prices
for Turkish produce compared with competing products from other Mediterra-
nean countries. Packing and grading methods now employed by the companies
need much greater standardization and strict quality control inspection.
The demand of the markets in Western Europe, particularly of the rapidly
growing chain and multiple retailers, make packinghouse processing manda-
tory. At present, only a small proportion of the export is dealt with in
this way.
10.       Companies do not now require that their export output go through
packinghouses, with the result that individual members of the companies
field-pack their products to avoid the packinghouse charge and to lower the
reject rate. This is fatal to the maintenance of quality.
11.       Packaging material must be improved.  Cartons are rapidly replac-
ing the wooden boxes now being used in Turkey. Cartons are cheaper than
wooden boxes in most Mediterranean countries but in Turkey they are con-
siderably more expensive. The wooden box (bruce-box type), however, is
superior and should be retained, although poplar wood should replace the



ANNEX 7
Page 4
inferior red pine presently used in manufacture. Poplar is more attractive
and serviceable and the extra cost (4Z to 5%) would be more than recouped
by a reduction in breakages and better presentation.
Production Companies' Operations
12.       Each company makes purchase contracts with growers before the
harvest. The contract is either for an acreage of the crop or for a ton-
nage. Some of the companies specify quality and take only fruit that meets
their standards at the time of harvesting. In most cases, the buyer is
responsible for harvesting, grading, and packaging. Some also undertake
application of fertilizer and pest control measures after completing the
purchase contract.
13.       The price paid for the fruit seems to be determined mainly by;
(a) the grower's reputation for quality;
(b) his reliability as a supplier (i.e. his reputation for
delivering the quantity contracted); and
(c) home demand.
Home demand is the dominant factor in producer price formation for citrus.
Moreover, home demand is growing rapidly, therefore the exportable surplus
of citrus without the project is not growing sufficiently for substantial
export expansion. The projected export surplus for citrus is as follows:
1972    1976      1980
--('000 tons)----
Production without project          572.2   722.4    779.8
Domestic consumption                470.7   584.7    728.4
Surplus without project             101.5   137.7      51.4
Project production                      0    14.4    153.8
Exportable surplus with project   101.5   152.1    205.2
14.       The rate at which each variety of citrus would be absorbed by
domestic consumption would vary, as is indicated by the following table,
showing percentage of exports to production.
1963     1964      1965      1966     1967      1968      1969
Oranges            4.7       1.7      7.2       5.0       3.9      4.2       4.9
Mandarins          2.2       8.6     14.1      19.3      24.2     33.1      36.8
Lemons            28.3      17.3     10.4      28.2      28.0     34.4      31.3
Grapefruit        23.3      29.4     36.8      30.0      37.8     35.4      54.9
Total Citrus       7.6       4.6      8.8      10.4      10.4     12.8      13.6



ANNEX 7
Page 5
15.       In "early" districts where fruit is available for harvest before
it is in other competing Mediterranean countries, export demand also has a
strong, although short-lived, influence on price (Tarsus grapes and early
lemons are cases in point). Some quality premiums are offered to growers
but on a somewhat arbitrary basis, since grading and quality standards are
not as yet controlled closely enough.
16.       Since the great bulk of the goods is destined for the home mar-
ket, it is packed to low standards and choicer fruits are set aside for the
export markets. The companies buy much produce that is already packed, but
subject it to an inspection in addition to that performed by the Govern-
ment Inspection Service.
Export Markets
17.       Each company has its own contacts in Western European markets.
Each has a number of importers or agents in the main countries and almost
all export is on a consignment basis. Export quantities and destinations
are determined by:
(a) request of the importer or agent in the market concerned;
(b) anticipated price level or current price level; and
(c) availability of the supply and transport facilities.
Since the distribution interval (transport time) is anything from seven to
14 days or longer, current market prices are not a very reliable guide.
For this reason, the Turkish exporter can rarely negotiate a firm price,
although it is sometimes possible to obtain a guaranteed advance before
dispatch of goods. Normally, however, the exporter carries the full market
price fluctuation risk.
18.       Price falls from the season start in fruit and vegetable commodi-
ties can be rapid, particularly when Turkish produce is early, compared
to other competing Mediterranean countries. In order to obtain the high
opening prices, the export companies make every effort to send the first
consignments, as do all competing producing countries. But Turkey has no
controls or "official" opening dates for the season so that immature fruit
is often sent, which acts to the detriment of Turkish fruit in general.
Most competing countries have fixed a "sugar content" standard for the
opening of the season and maintain it throughout the season.
The Cost of Export Sales
19.       All costs of landing, off-loading, tax and import duties, and such
are charged by the importer against sale proceeds and, in addition, he
deducts a commission as his remuneration for services rendered. The terms
are negotiated between the importer and exporter and are not standardized
in any of the main European markets.



ANNEX 7
Page 6
20.      The following are typical costs and charges (negotiated varia-
tions are not significant):
Austria                           6% to 8% of gross sales proceeds.
Federal Republic of Germany
(auction selling)           4%; if credits have been opened, 5%; 1/2%
bank charges.
(wholesale market sales)   6% plus 1% bank charges.
United Kingdom                    Importer's agents, 5%; wholesaler's sellidg
charge, 6%.
Switzerland                       Wholesaler's selling charge, 8%.
Other Charges
United Kingdom                     (per 20-kg box) off-loading/sorting/cartagel
clearance/documentation sh 3/box (US436).
Federal Republic of Germany       Market handling/off-loading 1 I12 box;
appropriate import duty; insurance.
Other European market charges are on a similar scale, with the exception of
Finland, where imports are purchased at a firm FOB price against credit
documents.
The Central Marketing.Organization
21-.      Government (SPO) is pressing forward activation of the recently
fotmed Central Marketing Organization, MEPA (Merkezi Pazarlama Anonim
Ortakligi), whose function will be to export the output of the production
companies. Successful operation of MEPA is crucial to the success of the
Turkish drive to increase fruit and vegetable exports since centralization
of the marketing function will make it possible for Turkey to:
(a)  meet the requirements of European markets for large quan-
titiet of standardized high quality products demanded by
multiple retail sales organizations. Fragmentation of
exports means, in effect, that these buyers cannot be
supplied;
(b)  consolidate exports to simplify transport arrangements and
organization;
(c)  follow rational supply policies, i.e. long-term supply
contracts can be entered into and quantities and dispatches
to various markets regulated in such a way as to minimize
the danger of over-supply, followed by avoidable price
falls;



ANNEX 7
Page 7
(d) plan sales promotion efforts;
(e) simplify quality control and provide technical export
services, including market intelligence and study;
(f) build up financial reserves on a community basis; and
(g) place itself in a position to compete on more equal terms
with neighboring countries already trading with a cen-
tralized functional structure.
22.       It must be clear that such services to the production companies
are indispensable to the maximization of export proceeds. The nature of
MEPA is to provide central services to the companies, which it organizes
and regulates. Total outputs are divided by it between the markets in such
a way as to maximize returns. Almost all Turkish fruit and vegetable
exports are sold by appointed agents or wholesalers in the foreign markets
on a commission basis.
23.       MEPA will take over from the six constituent production companies
the responsibility for their exports of fruits and vegetables. It will
have no quasi legal powers but will operate by contract with the production
companies. Its power and influence reside in its control of credits and
other export facilities and incentives. Nevertheless, it will not be given
monopolistic powers.
24.       MEPA will contract with individual companies before each comod-
ity season for a specific quantity and quality of the product concerned
and offer a guaranteed minimum first payment (or advance payment). MEPA
will phase the export, arranging transport and sale in the country of des-
tination. In the event that the consignment does not meet the contract
specification, the contract will be invalidated and the goods disposed of
for the account of the packer.
Export Stabilization Fund
25.       An Export Stabilization Fund will be built up by MEPA which will
make a percentage deduction from export proceeds. Initial funds should be
provided by the Government. It will be the aim and intention of MEPA to
build the Export Stabilization Fund up to a size that will enable national
export policies to be followed. That is, it should be able to finance tem-
porary and sudden price falls that otherwise would interrupt the flow of
supplies to a particular market. The fund would be reimbursed when the
price level recovers to a point where production costs are covered by pro-
ceeds.
Recommendations for Strengthening MEPA
26.       The problems involved in launching MEPA can be grouped into three
categories: (a) personnel, (b) organization, and (c) technical. Consulting
services should be provided to assist management in each of these categor-



ANNEX 7
Page 8
Les. Consultants should be recruited from successful national companies
such as exist in Holland and Israel and their patterns of operations adopted
to the extent possible in Turkey.
B. Quality Control
Export Quality Control
27.       The essence of good quality control is an inspection service,
independent of the producer or the trader. In most European countries the
Inspection Service for produce is recruited, trained and financed by the
Government or a Governmental agency -- usually the Ministry of Agriculture.
The inspection itself is twofold, for quality standards and for health
(phytopathological). In Turkey the quality and standards inspection serv-
ice is administered by the Ministry of Commerce and employs some 69 field
inspectors. They use the standards laid down by the OECD (which includes
EEC and EFTA countries) and all other Western European countries outside
these groupings. The health service is administered by the Ministry of
Agriculture and (for produce) is concerned with pest control, insecticide
and other residues, etc. The staff totals 360 inspectors for all agricul-
tural products.
Inspection in the Field
28.       Produce inspection in the field is generally undertaken by a team
of two, one health inspector from the Ministry of Agriculture and one quality
and standardization inspector from the Ministry of Commerce. Packers inform
the area staff when they require these services and the inspection takes
place. The inspectors travel to the location, usually at the farm, and
fix their inspection marks and give the appropriate certificates, without
which export cannot take place. There appears to be some delay between
the receipt of a demand for inspection and its execution, but we were assured
that the inspection staff is sufficient for all normal purposes. There is,
however, an acknowledged need for a more careful and a higher percentage
check of packages. A port or frontier final inspection is not normally
undertaken. It should be recorded that, although we heard no complaints
about the inspection services in Turkey, they were the chief target for
criticism in the European export markets. OECD grade specifications,
passed in Turkey, have frequently to be challenged and the produce degraded
or reduced to lower classifications before sale. The health control seems
to be more satisfactory. This is understandable since the sanction is to
refuse entry of the produce concerned.

C. Trade Restrictions -- Tariffs, Duties and Quotas
Relations Between Turkey and the European Community
29.       The Association Agreement between the European Economic Community
and Turkey, which came into force on December 1,. 1964, has as its object
Turkish membership in the Community. This customs union is to be achieved
in three stages: (a) preparatory stage, (b) transition stage, and (c)
final stage. The preparatory stage of five years came to an end on December
1, 1969. The agreement for the transition stage was signed in Brussels
on November 23. This stage is to lead to the establishment of a customs
union within 12 years from the start of the transition stage.
30.       A number of stages are envisaged for implementation of the tran-
sition toward a customs union. Certain preferences are granted for Turkish
exports to the EEC, for instance, tariff concessions relating to fresh
products, such as citrus fruits and grapes. For oranges there is a 40%
reduction on the common customs tariff, and for other citrus and grapes
the reduction will be 50%. However, grapes receive this tariff concession
only between June 15 and July 15.
31.       Whenever the price at the point of entry is below the reference
price fixed by the European Commission, the preference is suspended and
there also may be a compensatory duty imposed to support the reference
price.
32.       Within the framework of recently concluded negotiations with
Turkey, the EEC is to offer certain additional preferences. The list is
unofficial and subject to confirmation as soon as the schedules relating
to the Agreement are published. Indications are that other fruits and
vegetables such as chards, cardoons, beans, olives, peppers, capers, fresh
figs, quinces, pistachios, nuts, pine-seeds (plus certain unsweetened
canned fruits) will be granted a 50% reduction on the common customs tariff
and will not be subject to quota restrictions. Fruits and vegetables
such as tomatoes, peaches, strawberries and cherries are not yet among the
products that have been freed, but are expected to be included in new
schedules developed periodically during the transitional stage.
33.       Member states of the EEC may request periodic country quotas
where imports may disrupt the national market. Thus France has imposed
quotas for peaches and grapes during the periods when its own national pro-
duction comes on the market. These quotas and periods vary, and are fixed
anew each year. Belgium, for its part, prohibits the import of peaches
from August 1 to September 9 and of apples from July 16 to September 15.
The Other Associated Countries
34.       It would seem useful to make a quick comparison between the vari-
ous associated countries or countries seeking association, viz. Greece,
Mforocco, Tunisia and Israel, all of which receive certain tariff prefer-



ANNEX 7
Page 10
ences. Under the agreement between the EEC and Greece,.which came into
force on December 1, 1962, Greek products enjoy the common tariff reduc-
tions. In addition, Greece is not subject to the system of compeusatory
duties mentioned above. This privileged position has drawn some criticism,
since Greece anu Turkey are nor at the same stage of development,, and their
geographical proximity accentuates this difference in treatment. It should,
however, be pointed.out that from the legal point of view the agreement
between the-EEC and.Greece is.atfinal agreement directly envisaging the
establishment of a-customs union, whiereaa. the agreement between the EEC
and!Turkey is only a transition agreement,,which implies that the obligations
relating to the estabLishment of a union are more flexible than in the case
of, a. final agreementc
35.       Moroccoanaa  Tunisia occupy a.special position.  They are con3id--
ered as third countries by the members of the EEC and thus subject to the
common custJm tariff, except, however, im France,, where their products
enter free of customs duty. but remain; subject to the compensatory duty
eystem_  When the association agreements between the EEC and M4orocco and
the EEC and Tunisia - currently in.preparation. - come into force, the
European Community proposes. to implemeat a general system of conditional
preferencess vis-a-vis the principal citrus-prQducing countries in the
MIediterranean basiL, including, Turkey X
36.       Spain, which is currently' seeking association,, and Israel both
receive a 40% reduction on the common customs tariff for citrus fruits.
It is reported that the duties levied on other Israeli products are to be
reduced following the recent negotiations. between the Community authorities
and the Israeli Goernment.
37.       It Is reasonable to suppose that if and when the UK joins the
Common Market, tariff preferences and freedom from customs duties generally
accorded members of the Commonwealth will be extinguished since the Euro-
pean Community is based on reciprocal rights and obligations. This cannot
but favor exports from countries such as Turkey, if such countries have
been able to get a firm footing on the European market. In the light of
these prospects in the EEC, it would be in Turkey's Interests to build pos-
sible marketing outlets now.
Trade Relationships with Other West European Countries
38.       The European Free Trade Association (EFTA), including UK, Austria,
Denmark, Norway, Portugal and Ireland, has no common agricultural tariff
policy. Therefore, all other potential European importers impose restric-
tions on a national basis. There have been, however, significant reductions
in duties through the Kennedy Round of Tariff Reductions, For a tabulation
of the current tariff rates, see Appendix 7-1.

FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EXPORT PROJECT
Project Management and Technical Assistance
Project Unit
1.        A new Government agency would be created as a division of the newly
created Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and would be located in
Ankara. It would be known as the Fruit and Vegetable Export Project Unit
and would consist of a minimum of three professionals experienced in govern-
ment organization and in export and production of fruit and vegetables.
The three professionals would be: (a) the Project Director, (b) the
Technical Adviser for Transport and Marketing Facilities and (c) the
Technical Advisor for Plantations and Production. This unit would also
have clerical staff and would use consultants to perform its necessary
functions. The two Technical Advisors would require expertise that may not
be available in Turkey and may have to be internationally recruited. They,
as well as the Project Director, would be subject to Bank/IDA approval.
The Project organization chart appears as Appendix 8-1.
2.        The Project Unit would have the following duties and responsibil-
ities:
(a) to assist subborrowers in preparing feasibility studies
and applications for loans for ferry ships, trailers and
towing units, maintenance facilities, packinghouses, cold
storages and box factories and to provide consultants'
services where necessary;
(b) to conduct technical appraisals of all applications for
subloans for transport and marketing facilities and to
use consultant services where needed;
(c) to assist the Citrus Lxtension Unit (CEU) in formulating
model farm plans and approve criteria for technical ap-
praisal of sub-loans to farmers and to provide consulting
services where needed;
(d)  to provide consulting services where needed to assist sub-
borrowers such as: (i) the ferry ship company, (ii) truck-
ing companies, and (iii) packing, cold storage or box manufac-
turing companies and to provide consulting services to
companies or institutions which are performing vital func-
tions in the export of fruit and vegetables, including the
Central Marketing Company (MEPA), the Ministry of Agricul-
ture Phytosanitary Inspection Service and the Ministry of
Comnerce Export Standards Inspection Service;



ANN I"X Pi
Page 2
(e)  to approve research plans prepared iy the Citrus Research
Institute at Antalya and Mersin and to authorize foreign
exchange expenditures in connection with such research;
(f)  to assist with the preparation of tender documents in
connection with internationial competitive bidding proceo-
ures and to bulk order; where possible;
(g) to maintain close contact with all Government agencies
and private comLpanies in order to coordinate activities
necessarv to improve the quantity and quality of exports
of fruit and vegetables from Turkey; and
(h)  to maintain close liaison with Bank/IDA and to report nuart-1 v
to Bank/IDA on all activities and expenditures tinder the Pc,-
ect and to provide an audited annual report on activities
and expenditures under the Project.
Consulting and Training
3.        The overall success of the Project requires consulting services
in the technical and managerial aspects of planning and operating the sub-
system vital to a modern export marketing operation. All consulting
services would be undet the direct control and supervision of the Project
Unit. The consulting services and training would include:
(a)  Assistance to subborrowers in preparing feasibility and
operational plans in connection with subloan applications
for ferry ships, trailers and towing units, maintenance
facilities, export handling facilities, and nurseries.
The cost of these services would primarily be borne by the
subborrower but the Project Director should be able to
provide the necessary services to assist in this function.
(b)  Consulting services will be required by the Project Unit
for technical appraisal of applications for subloans and
to assist in evaluating tender documents and subloan con-
tracts for technical and legal requirements.
(c)  Much importance is attached to the proner organization
and management of the Central Marketing Company (MEPA),
which will take over the marketing function of its five
member production companies which accounted for 80% of
fruit and vegetable exports in 1970. MEPA must build a
sophisticated organization including: (i) overseas agents
for constant contact with importers, (it) a market infor-
mation system, (iii) an export guarantee fund to equalize
sales over periods of depressed markets, and (iv) a system
of production committees to rationalize the source of sup-
ply. Consulting services would be provided by two consultants
for one year and by one for the third year to assist in these
organizing problems.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
(d) The transport companies will need consulting services in
order to efficiently organize their scheduling, invoicing,
maintenance and personnel training programs. This would
include one shipping consultant for two years and two
specialists in road transport for one year. Funds would
also be made available for overseas training programs.
This would include one shipping consultant for two years
and two specialists in road transport for one year.
Funds would also be made available for overseas training
of ferry ship management for two months, probably in
Rotterdam.
(e)  Two Government agencies are charged with inspection serv-
ices for exports.  The Ministry of Agriculture is charged
with issuing the phytosanitary certificate showing exports
free from pests and disease and the Ministry of Commerce
is responsible for the grading of exports according to
international standards of size and quality. These serv-
ices need improvement of operations and funds would be
provided for two consultants for six months each to assist
these agencies in establishing procedures for more efficient
operations of these inspection and grading functions.
The Citrus Extension Unit
4.  -     To ensure an adequate staff of qualified people suitably equipped
to supervise the on-farm citrus development, a Citrus Extension Unit (CEU)
would be especially created for the project in the Ministry of Agriculture.
It would be the nucleus for the long-range development of citrus production
and would be expanded steadily through later stages. The CEU would be advis-
ed by a Regional Steering Committee composed of representatives of the
Regional Horticulture Research Institute, the Regional Directorate for Soil
and Water Conservation, the Seyhan Irrigation Project Manager, the ABT and
other Ministries as agreed upon by the Project Unit. The CEU would report to
the Minister of Agriculture.
5.        CEU would be located in Adana and initially staffed with a Di-
rector, two citrus specialists, a farm management specialist, and an irri-
gation specialist. There would also be a minimum of three village agents
who would receive on-the-job training before assuming their duties. In the
second year, the Unit would need seven agents and three trainees; in the
third year, 10 agents and two trainees; and in the fourth year, 12 agents.
6.        CEU would liaise with SIEU on matters relating to citrus develop-
ment loans made within the Seyhan Project areas (para 3.04). Actual service
to farmers would be provided within the Seyhan Project by SIEU and outside
the Seyhan by CEU. One citrus specialist from CEU would be seconded to SIEU
and the Director of CEU would sit on SIEU's coordinating committee. The
two Units would be responsible for assisting farmers in their resp-ctive
areas in drawing up farm plans and for performing technical apprais;i's for
the local branches of the ABT, according to established criteria. Agents of



ANNEX 8

the Units would supervise credit use to ensure that the best citriculture
practices were employed.
Research
7.        Research program would be developed by the Citrus Research Insti-
tute at Mersin and the Citrus Research Institute at Antalya, and approved
by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Technical Advisor for Plantations
and Production. The Institute at Mersin would also be responsible for the
propagation farm.

FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EXPORT PROJECT
Agriculture Credit Survey
1.        Objective.  The objective of the proposed agriculture credit survey
is to review and define Turkey's agricultural credit needs, especially medium-
and long-term, in relation to the priorities for agricultural development
over the next five years, to examine and recommend appropriate policies,
capital sources, and institutional arrangements for supplying these needs
and to examine the possibilities of developing agricultural credit programs.
The survey would include:
(a)  A review of past agricultural credit experience over the
last 5 years, concentrating on credit for production
purposes, but giving brief details of credit for marketing
of agricultural produce and for related agricultural
activities:
(i) existing credit policies of Government, Central
Bank and other credit institutions, and their
relationship to credit policies in other sectors;
(ii) existing agencies: commercial banks, agricultural
banks and cooperatives concerned with agricultural
credit; their place in credit and banking system,
organization, interrelationship; review should also
examine role of non-institutional credit sources;
(iii) sources of credit funds for lending agencies, re-
discounting facilities, rural savings, budgetary
and foreign sources and role of agricultural banks
and cooperatives in mobilizing resources; analysis
of costs of funds from main sources for each credit
agency;
(iv) analysis of costs of lending operations, comparison
of agricultural interest rates with those of other
sectors, their relation to size and purpose of loan,
to agricultural subsidies, and to inflation; analysis
of overdue loans, covering period overdue, efficiency
of collection techniques and reasons for delinquency;



ANNEX 9
Page 2
(v) types and volume of production credit for current
inputs, on-farm investments and investments in agri-
culture-related industries compared with gross
agricultural production, GNP, and total credit for
all purposes; loan distribution by purpose, number
and size of loans, related to farm size categories,
and to total number of farms;
(vi) technical and financial loan appraisal techniques,
borrower selection and borrowing terms with due
attention to security requirements, legal instruments
of security and their effectiveness;
(vii) external constraints to agricultural credit, including
land tenure situations, existing indebtedness, suffi-
ciency of qualified staff, extension, research, timely
availability of farm inputs, and marketing facilities;
price policies regarding farm inputs and commodities;
and
(viii) taxes including import/export duties and their effect
on farm input costs, farm output prices and generation
of government tax revenue.
(b)  Future agricultural credit policies and institutions, including
any recommended changes in institutional arrangements, policies
and practices, and any measures for increasing and mobilizing
rural savings, expanding rediscount facilities, and encouraging
further private commercial banking in agriculture.
(c) Estimated credit requirements for the next five years:
(i) farm credit needs, based upon survey of farm households
and projected future developments, for seasonal and
longer term credit; these should cover the relationship
between seasonal and longer term loans, and include
investments for land and water development, seedlings
and other nursery stock, farm buildings, tree plantations,
livestock, machinery, and equipment; and
(ii) credit needs for related agricultural activities,
including handling, marketing, and processing of farm
products; procurement and distribution of fertilizers,
seed, farm chemicals, machinery, forestry and fisheries.
(d) Proposed specific credit programs in support of priorities in
Agricultural Sector:
(i) institutions concerned;
(ii) lending programs.

TURKEY
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EXPORT PROJECT
Market Prospects and Prices
General
1.        While Turkey produces a broad range of fruit and vegetables,
studies 1/ have resulted in a list of commodities that show the most prom-
ise in relation to Turkey's production and European market demand.  These
feasibility reports recommend expansion of citrus, grapes, peaches, straw-
berries, new potatoes, onions, melons, green beans, bell peppers, asparagus,
and artichokes. Of these, four products would have 90% of the tonnage
potential: citrus, grapes, new potatoes, and onions.
Citrus
2.        World citrus 2/ production and trade, stimulated by growing de-
mand for fresh and processed products and comparatively high per acre fi-
nancial returns, are continuing the upward trend established over the last
two decades. As a result of this trend, competition has increased (without
necessarily depressing prices) and market shares in the distribution of
exports have been gradually changing. This dynamic pattern is likely to
continue for some years to come.
3.        Total world citrus production in 1963-68 3/ rose from 22.7 mil-
lion tons to 32.2 million tons, representing an annual increase of 7.2%.
The rate of expansion was more than twice as high in the developed coun-
tries as in the developing countries and there were parallel developments
in world trade; exports rose at 5.6% per annum in 1963-68, with an increasing
share of the market going to the developed exporting countries (Appendix
12-1).
4.        The volume of fresh citrus fruit entering international trade is
dependent, to a large degree, on the needs of Western European countries,

and such), grapefruit, limes and lemons.

which account for over four-fifths of the world imports. The fruit is im-
ported into this area largely in the winter season and is obtained chiefly
from Mediterranean sources, though summer imports are now rising. Total
citrus imports in 1963-68 averaged about 4 million tons, with oranges
alone accounting for over 3 million tons. Shipments fluctuate from season
to season, depending on supplies. For example, imports of oranges into
Western Europe did not rise in 1968 although in 1969 they went up by 10%.
The bulk of the demand was met by Spain, followed by Israel and Morocco.
5.        Tariff protection is not a significant influence on trade in
oranges as it is on trade in many other fruits. In this connection, it is
interesting to note that, in spite of the protection, exports of oranges
from Italy (the only producer in the European Economic Community (EEC)) to
other EEC members, who account for four-fifths of the West European im-
ports, have been declining.
6.        The Federal Republic of Germany (Germany) and France are the lead-
ing importers of oranges, followed by the United Kingdom. More than half
of Germany's orange imports comes from Spain while other suppliers are
Morocco, Israel, Italy, and South Africa. Spain also tops the list of
orange suppliers to France, followed by Algeria and Morocco. Orange sup-
plies for the United Kingdozi come mainly from Spain, Israel, and South
Africa; sizable quantities also come from Cyprus, Brazil, and Morocco.
7.        Germany is the largest importer of lemons in the world, buying
about 130 thousand tons per year. The market is dominated by Italy, which
meets about 75% of German requirements. Spain furnishes another 15%; the
remaining 10% is shared by the United States, Turkey, and Chile.
8.        Grapefruit has been one of the most buoyant markets, largely be-
cause of remarkable growth in the United Kingdom, which now accounts for a
third of Western Europe's total imports of the fruit. The largest suppliers
of grapefruit to the United Kingdom are Israel, South Africa, and Cyprus.
9.        The main determinant of growth in per capita demand has so far
been the rise in incomes. FAO estimates 1/ of income elasticity of demand,
for oranges which take into account the results of family budget data and per
capita consumption levels, are given below. These coefficients represent
average values for the period 1965-66. Since income elasticities of demand
normally tend to decline with rising levels of incomes and/or consumption,
the present values of the coefficient may be lower and may decline further by
1975.

France                                           0.6
Rising population and adequate supplies at apparently attractive prices for
both producers and consumers also contributed to the growth. Although
prices often experience sharp fluctuations because citrus output is highly
susceptible to weather influences, the general trend over the years has
been horizontal. It is true, however, that, in constant dollar terms,
prices have been gradually weakening.
10.       The FAO Study Group on Citrus Fruit, in which principal importing
and exporting countries are represented, periodically reviews the world
market situation and prospects. These consultations, in terms of their
influence on on government policies, can be partly credited for the rela-
tive stability that has prevailed in world markets. The last session of
the Study Group, held in May 1969, estimated that world production of citrus
between mid-1960's and mid-1970's 1/ would rise by 60% to over 40 million
tons (34 million tons of oranges and tangerines, 4 million tons of lemons,
and 3.5 million tons of grapefruit). The Group also concluded that there
"could be a delicate balance between export availabilities and import de-
mand in the medium term"'. 2/ It is likely that both supply and demand
estimates may be somewhat conservative.
11.       If a simple assumption is made that the average income elasticity
of demand will be only 0.4 in the case of the importing countries, income
and population growth projections imply that there should be at least a
3.5% per annum rate of growth in import demand. Additional impetus to
growth can be expected from the development of new markets.
12.       The rate of growth in production for export, particularly in the
developing countries, may be somewhat faster, which indicates that competi-
tion may intensify especially for oranges. However, because major exporting
countries restrict exports in times of surplus, actual prices should remain
close to the level of 1967/68. A continued weakening of prices in real terms
would, of course, put pressure on expansion prospects in the high income
areas while also giving further impetus to demand growth.

13.       The argument for a somewhat faster rate of growth in production
in the case of the smaller exporting countries, which would necessarily
benefit from the price policies of the larger exporters, additionally hinges
on the "low barriers to entry" argument, provided they can streamline their
marketing and quality control. The projections summarized below, based on
the assumption that prices in current dollar terns will be maintained close
to the 1966-68 levels, show that, in spite of the relatively high rate of
growth in citrus exports, the Turkish share of the market will remain very
small.

14_       As for moast fruits and vegetables, there is a considerable degree
of seasonal variation in the market prices of citrus.  The pattern was in-
vestigated for the Hamburg market, based on the years 1960 to 1969. Assum-
ing that the seasonal factors will remain by and large unchanged over the
medium term, the price variations for oranges and lemons can be expected to
behave in the foUowing manner.

Table Grapes
15.       The world market for table grapes, stimulated by the same factors
as those affecting citrus and other preferred horticultural products, has
been more buoyant than most competing fruits. Except for occasional fluc-
tuations caused by poor crops, prices 1/ have changed very little since the
mid-1950's. Over the next several years, a retardation in the rate of
growth as consumption rises and probably keener competition in markets as
exportable supplies expand are envisaged. However, basic economic forces
underlying the market for table grapes are not expected to alter so that
seasonal average price trends should continue to be maintained at the level
of recent years (US cents 19 per kg unit value of import into Germany).
16.       World (excluding the centrally planned countries) output of
table grapes rose from 4.0 million tons in 1963 to 4.9 million tons in
1968. However, developments in output are of comparatively lesser consequence
because barely 15% of the production is exported. World exports rose at
6.5% per annum in 1963-68 while the rate of growth in exports from developing
countries, 11.6% per annum, was nearly twice as high (Appendix 12-2). This
faster rate reflected a rising demand for off-season fresh grapes.
17.       The main market for fresh grapes is confined to Europe, both
Eastern and Western, with the region accounting for about 80% of global
trade. Europe, though, is also a major grape producing region, contribut-
ing 70% of world output, and in most cases barriers to entry from elsewhere
have been traditionally high. However, in recent years, import restric-
tions outside the main marketing season, August-October, have been con-
siderably reduced. (Turkey expects to market its grapes in the off-season.)
The data on European import duties by months are shown in Annex 7.
Prospects of marketing grapes in June and early July and again in December
and January are rather encouraging. Moreover, prices tend to be higher in
these months, although the index of seasonal variation could not be com-
puted due to lack of sufficient data.
18.       Demand for table grapes is favorably influenced by a number of
factors other than population growth: per capita consumption of grapes is
low in most countries (Appendix 12-3), income elasticity of demand is rela-
tively high, and grape prices have traditionally shown stability. Given
a continuation of these trends, as foreseen, demand for off-season grapes
should continue to rise at about 10% per annum (somewhat lower than the
growth rate realized during the 1960's), at current average level of prices.
19.       Turkey is a relatively large producer of grapes but the varieties
grown are suitable chiefly for raisins. Turkish share of the market for
table grapes is comparatively small, about 1% of world exports and about 7%
(1963-68 average) of the exports from the developing countries (Appendix 12-1).
In fact, exports of table grapes suffered a decline in 1963-68 when lack of
1/   Average unit values of export per annum.



ANNEX 12
Page 6
supplies deprived Turkey of a chance to expand its markets at a time when
demand was growing rapidly (Appendix 12-4). If grapes of suitable quality
were available in off-months, Turkey should be able to achieve a doubling
of its modest level of exports, from an estimated 40,000 tons in 1970 to
80,000 tons in 1975.
Vegetables
20.       There is a large variety of fresh vegetables (new potatoes, new
carrots, green beans, cauliflowers, tomatoes, onions, artichokes, asparagus.
eggplant and capsicums) available for export from the Mediterranean area
and they are in demand in Western Europe (mainly Germany, France, and the
United Kingdom) during the off-season of domestic production when duties
are removed or considerably reduced, provided their quality is excellent.
According to European importers, most consumers of fresh early vegetables
tend to be quality-conscious rather than price-conscious. In addition to
quality, organized marketing channels from the farm level to the grocery
shelf are necessary for the successful operation of the fresh vegetable
trade.
21.       Turkish export information on new potatoes and onions is scanty.
Although production of onions in recent years has averaged roughly 500,000
m tons, exports have been nil, except for a small quantity in 1967. A
similar situation exists for potatoes. Production of a" types of potatoes
has averaged approximately 1,700,000 m tons and exports have been exceed-
ingly small.
22.       If Turkey is to become a successful exporter of new potatoes and
onions, it must first produce the varieties of vegetables demanded in the West-
ern European market and compete on a seasonal basis (early potatoes March
through June). In general, current Turkish vegetable production does not
include the varieties required. Also, the quality of the produce must be
able to withstand the journey.
23.       Potatoes.  The demand for potatoes may be divided into two
markets -- the new", or early, potato market, which is in the relatively
high income countries, and the "old", or regular, potato market.
24.       From available market information, it is fairly evident that
Turkey has exported an exceedingly small quantity of regular-type potatoes
to the Middle East countries, chiefly Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria, and
Saudi Arabia. Over the past 10 years, imports of potatoes, from all
sources, into these five countries have fluctuated yearly but have shown no
upward or downward trend. Since this does not seem to be an expanding
market, it is to the advantage of Turkey to develop an export trade for new
potatoes in Western Europe where the market is expanding, although slowly
(para 25).
25.       The main importers of new potatoes in Western Europe are the
United Kingdom, Germany, and France; in 1967 their aggregate imports
amounted to 658,000 m tons, as shown in Appendix 12-5. The yearly expansion



ANNEX 12
Page 7
in this trade from 1962 to 1968 was 1.0%. When the new potato imports of
the three countries from 1962 to 1968 are examined individually, Germany shows
a yearly growth of 6%. In contrast, the trend of imports into the other
two countries was stagnant (United Kingdom) or somewhat declining (France).
Several other countries are relatively small importers, as shown in
Appendix 12-5, but it is not possible to show their aggregate imports since
statistical data, in many instances, do not show new potatoes separately.
Aggregate imports of new potatoes to Germany, the United Kingdom, and France
from 1962 to 1965 are as follows:

1962        639                 1966         515

26.       Before examining Turkey's position in the Western European new
potato market, it may be useful to note the sources of supply in the three
large importing countries mentioned in the previous paragraph.
27.       Traditionally, Italy has been the main supplier to Germany,
accounting for 90%; the Italian type (non-mealy yellow) is the preferred
variety. Outside the EEC area, the only other suppliers of any size, al-
though small in relation to Italy, are the United Arab Republic (U.A.R.)
and Morocco. Turkey would be a new supplier; during the past 10 years
(1958 to 1968), she exported a small quantity of new potatoes to Germany
in one year only.
28.       Formerly the main supplier of new potatoes into France was Al-
geria, accounting for 80% in the mid-1950's; by 1967, Algeria's share was
only 27%. France has been widening her sources of supply, which tradi-
tionally comprised three suppliers (Algeria, Morocco, and Spain), to in-
clude Greece, Egypt, Italy, and Belgium/Luxembourg. In 1967, Morocco was
the largest individual supplier, about 41%, and, together with Algeria and
Spain, accounted for about three-quarters of the total imports. The bulk
of the Moroccan new potatoes enters the French market from mid-March to
end-May, whereas the Algerian and Spanish supplies arrive mostly in April
and May. In France, a white-fleshed potato has preference.
29.       New potatoes, along with fresh vegetables entering the EEC, face
a number of regulations that are aimed to give protection to domestic pro-
duction within the Community. One of the main regulations is the rate of
duty for third countries, which is as follows:



ANNEX 12
Page 8
Potatoes, early -- January to May 15        15%
-- May 16 to June 30      21%
Potatoes, old                               18%
For new potatoes, the increase in the rate of duty from mid-May is due to
the fact that domestic production is beginning to become available and,
after June, becomes more plentiful; also, the foreign suppliers' potatoes
can probably no longer be classified as "new". In addition to duties, quality
standards are applied. Additionally, imports from third countries are subject
to a countervailing tax whan a reference price is established. The
countervailing charge is the difference between the free-at-frontier price
(import price before duties) and the reference price, which is set yearly
by the Community. It is based on the average producer prices in members'
growing regions during the previous three years. As an alternative, the
member country may suspend imports altogether rather than impose the charge.
So far, there has been no need for establishing reference prices for new
potatoes and onions. Furthermore, it is doubtful that there would be any
sizable lowering of producer prices if the level of domestic production is
to be maintained.
30.       In 1963, Turkey signed an association agreement with the EEC.
As a result, the rate of import duty applicable to Turkish vegetables
will ultimately be 50% of the levy applicable to third countries. A number
of other Mediterranean countries 1/ have negotiated preferential trade
agreements or association agreements with the EEC. Thus, Turkey gains
little tariff advantage in the EEC fresh vegetable market.
31.       The United Kingdom is the largest importer of new potatoes.  The
variety in demand is the white kidney shape, which scrapes easily. The
main suppliers are Cyprus, Canary Islands, and Spain, accounting for ap-
proximately 60% to 65% of the total imports. The season for imports is
from November to August. However, the main import months, when 90% of the
imports occur, are March through June. During June, Cyprus is the main
import supplier. No imports are permitted in September and October. From
June onwards, imports compete with domestic supplies. Cyprus' potatoes are
usually available from April to end-June; Canary Islands', from mid-December
to end-April; Spain's, from March to May 20.
32.       New potatoes from Cyprus (a Couuonvealth country) enter the
United Kingdom duty-free. Imports from other countries are subject to the
following rates of duty:
l/   Greece, Morocco, Spain and Israel; several other countries (particularly
Cyprus and Egypt) have commenced to negotiate. All of these countries
export new potatoes or onions, or both.

33.       Exports of new potatoes from Turkey have been estimated to amount
to 80,000 m tons by 1975.  If the yearly rate of growth for the past six
years for the three large importers continues to 1975, total imports may
amount to 622,000 m tons, calculated from the 1966-68 average at 1% yearly.
This implies that Turkey will account for 12.9% of the market in 1975, compared
with nil in 1970. This goal will probably require that Turkey penetrate the
French and British markets, as well as the rapidly expanding German market.
This may be feasible provided Turkish potatoes become available at the end
of February or early in March before potatoes from many of the other suppliers
are marketed. It should also be noted that Turkey will have market opportu-
nities for its new potatoes in several of the smaller importing countries,
such as the Scandinavian countries and Belgium.
34.       Onions.  The major world onion exporters are the U.A.R., Nether-
lands, and Spain, followed by Poland, Hungary, Italy, and Chile. The U.A.R.
crop is usually available from March to May when other exporters' crops
are limited. Turkey is a small, irregular exporter. Currently, it pro-
duces a brown-skinned pink-flesh type, but must produce the white-fleshed
and yellow varieties which seem to be preferred in Europe and there are no
major obstacle to the production of these varieties.
35.       Although Germany and the United Kingdom are the largest individ-
ual markets for onions, many other Western European countries, in particu-
lar France, also import, as shown in Appendix 12-5. Aggregate imports into
the 10 countries specified amounted to 580,000 m tons in 1967. However,
three countries (Germany, United Kingdom, and France) accounted for 85%
of the total. Aggregate imports of onions into these three countries
from 1962 to 1969 were as follows:
(thousand m tons)
1962        454                1966         488
1963        484                1967         491
1964        448                1968         476
1965        462                1969         525
Source:   Various issues of Fruit Intelligence, Commonwealth Economic
Committee.
36.       More than 40% of the imports into the United Kingdom comes from
Spain, followed by 20% from the Netherlands. For Germany, traditionally
the Netherlands and the U.A.R. are the main suppliers, although in recent
years imports from Spain, Poland, and Hungary have been increasing.

37.       Since most of the importers are also producers, the level of
imports depends somewhat on their domestic production. According to the
UNCTAD-GATT study 1/, about 60% of the total consumption in six countries 2/
in 1966/67 was accounted for by imports, amounting co 522,000 m tons. Ac-
cording to the study, imports of onions were forecast to rise at 1.5%
yearly from 1966/67 to 1971; most of the growth was attributed to Germany,
where imports are expected to increase from 203,000 to 228,000 m tons.
The overall rate of growth of 1.5% shown in the study is comparable with
the past rate of increase (1.6%) in total imports of onions into Germany,
United Kingdom, and France from 1962 to 1969. For these three individual
countries, the growth rates for the past seven years were 3.3%, -1.6%, and
5.4X, respectively.
38.       The duty on onions in Germany and the United Kingdom is as fol-
lows:
United Kingdom
Comonwealth                                                         free
Others -  Dry-bulb type -- August 1 to November 30             4s. 8d. per cwt.
Germany
EEC rate, third countries -  fresh onions                            12%
-  dried onions                          20%
Added value tax                                                      -5%
The association agreement with Turkey (para 30) applies to onions as well
as to potatoes, i.e. ultimately the rate of duty for onions will be 50%
of the levy applicable to third countries.
39.       Exports of onions from Turkey have been estimated to increase from
3,000 m tons in 1971 to 25,000 m tons in 1975. It is assumed that imports
into the 10 European countries, shown in Appendix 12-5, would increase from
580,000 m tons in 1967 to 653,000 m tons in 1965, or 1.5% yearly.  This implies
that Turkey's share of the Western European onion market in 1975 will be 3.8%,
a relatively small share of the market, which Turkey should be able to achieve.
Prices
40.       Forecating future price levels for fresh vegetables presents
many difficulties. Since market quotations for new potatoes over a series
of years are not available, the average unit values of imports into the
United Kingdom and France from 1955 to 1969 are shown in Appendix 12-6. For
1/   Selected Fresh Vegetables, Volume 2, International Trade Center,
UNCTAF/GATT, Geneva, 1968.
2/   Germany, 92%; United Kingdom, 75; Sweden, 57%; BLEU, 35%; Netherlands,
35%; and France, 26%.

France in the past 10 years, there is no evidence of an upward or downward
trend, although the price has fluctuated fairly widely from year to year.
The five-year average of the import price index for French new potatoes for
1960-64 averaged 92 and for 1965-69, 93. For the United Kingdom, in the
same 10-year period, although prices have fluctuated, there is evidence
of an upward movement. The 1965-67 United Kingdom producer prices for do-
mestically produced new potatoes were conducive to bumper crops, which
caused a decline in the 1968 price for imports. With a relatively low
1969 domestic crop, the price for imported new potatoes that year was sub-
stantiaLly higher than in 1968. However, the quantity imported was low
compared with the past two years. According to recent information, since
1970 domestic output improved, prices for imports in 1970 were fairly com-
parable with the 1968 level. In 1965-69, the United Kingdom price trend
for new potatoes was similar to that of the French, and the average index
for the last five years for both countries was very comparable. Thus, the
actual price over the next five years may be maintained within a range
somewhat comparable with the 1965-69 average price. In real prices (i.e.
in 1969 dollar terms), however, the price trend for new potatoes was down-
ward in the 1960-69 period, while, in actual terms, it was more or less
trendless, or slightly rising. Hence, an assumption that import prices
would remain at about the average of the last five years would seem to be
conservative, since in such a case there would be a falling real price in
the domestic markets (United Kingdom and France), which would encourage
demand and, at the same time, dampen growth in domestic supplies.
41.       With regard to onions, there has been a substantial upward shift
in the level of United Kingdom prices from year to year, as shown in Appen-
dix 12-6. Since the level of domestic production has been declining in
Germany and France and stagnating in the United Kingdom, rising demand
has been met by imports. This situation is expected to continue. There-
fore, prices should at least remain firm at the level of recent years. A
continuing rise in price would encourage domestic production, which would
compete with imported onions and eventually turn the price downward for im-
ports.
42.       To sum up -- demand in Northern, Western, and Central Europe for
Mediterranean-type fresh vegetables is continuing to expand, and prospects
for increased exports of high quality, well-presented produce are favorable,
provided its arrival time is carefully planned. In this connection, modern
production techniques must be used, the preferred varieties must be grown,
and an adequate market organization, particularly transport, must be devel-
oped. Moreover, it will be essential for the Turkish marketing authorities
to be alert to any changes in the import situation. Granted these provisos,
Turkey should be successful as a new entrant in the new potato and onion
markets of Western Europe.

FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EXPORT PROJECT
Operating Results of Sub-Borrowers
1.        The project would provide credit for ferry ships, road equipment,
export handling facilities and on-farm citrus development. Appendix 13-1
shows the financial rates of return resulting from the analyses of typical
financial models. Principal assumptions used in these calculations are
set out below.
Ferry Ships
2.        The ferry ships' financial model was based on an assumed tariff of
US$540 per trailer round trip, an average of 83% utilization of capacity
and an average economic life of 20 years. The tariff chosen would provide
an adequate incentive to truckers to use the ferry ships and at the same
time provide the ferries an adequate rate of return. The US$540 rate would
provide truckers with a 14% cash saving and a 20% saving on full costs
(including depreciation) over land movement on the Mersin/Munich/Mersn
route 1/. It also provides the ferry ships with a 17% rate of return.
3.        The ferries would operate on a fixed schedule.  Thus, virtually all
costs are fixed once the decision is made to maintain the schedule and
changes in tariff have a significant effect on cash flow and rate of return.
At the US$540 rate a 10% decrease in traffic lowers the rate of return by
about five percentage points. However, the ferry ships have considerable
leeway to raise rates and still attract traffic should the 83% utilization
figure prove optimistic. A variety of combinations of tariff and capacity
utilization give the same net benefit stream, as follows:
Saving to User
x Utilization      Tariff:       as % of Pull      Rate of

US$413 depreciation and interest); with the ferry boats the full cost
would be US$1,485 including US$256 depreciation and interest.

4.         Each of the ferry ships is assumed to make 47 weekly sailings per
year with 5 weeks each available for annual overhaul. In addition, each
vessel would have one spare day per week over and above normal transit and
loading and discharge time to meet possible delays from bad weather. Proj-
ected Turkey to Europe trailer traffic (not including transit loads) in 1975
that could use the ferry service is estimated to substantially exceed avail-
able ferry capacity by 4 to 5 times during most of the year and by at least
45% in the low months of January-April (Annex 6).
5.         Capital and operating cost estimates were prepared by TUMAS con-
sultants of Ankara and were reviewed for Bank/IDA by Thomson Transport Ana-
lysts of Rotterdam.
Trucking Company
6.        The trucking company model consisted of 10 towing units and 38
trailers, i.e. in the same proportion of towing units to trailers as would
be financed by the project. The model would represent the smallest possible
operational unit. Truckers would purchase varying ratios of toywing units
and trailers depending on their particular business needs; but overall the
trucking industry would be expected to buy towing units and trailers in these
proportions to make full use of the lower costs made possible by the ferry
ships.
7.        The trucking company model was based on the typical Adana/Munich
run, assuming that the trucking company passes on to exporters arnd importers
part of the savings provided by the ferry ships in the form of a 15% reduc-
tion on existing fares (both outbound and return) which would amount to about
US$350. Towing units would be expected to operate 100,000 km per year and to
have an economic life of four years with 25% residual value. The trailers
would operate on a smaller annual kilometerage (65,000 km on 19 return trips
to Europe per year) because of using the ferries and would have an economic
life of six years with 10% residual value. These kilometerage estimates are
well within good operating standards for truck operators.
8.        About 60% of truckers' cash operating costs are variable.  Conse-
quently, a given percentage reduction in traffic reduces the rate of retur-n
relatively little. A 10% reduction in traffic would reduce the truckers'
rate of return by four percentage points (to 28%). The rate of return is
more sensitive to rates charged. Competition could cause a further
reduction in rates (in addition to the 15% already assumed) during the low
season (January-April) for fruit and vegetables, although there is no
evidence of this happening to date. Under the extremely pessimistic
assumptions of a further 20% reduction in rates affecting one-third of a
trucker's traffic, his rate of return would decline 11 percentage points
(from 32% to 21%).
9.        The rate of return is based on assumed average loads of 18 tons
outbound and 11 tons return. The outbound assumption is realistic
since exporters would engage entire trailers. Return loads are variable and
would require some empty running in Europe to secure the business. A total



ANNEX 13
Page 3
of 900 km per return trip to obtain return loads and return to home base
after delivery, has been included as non-revenue generating travel. Some
existing operators claim they get 90% backhauls; the 11 ton (about 60%) as-
assumption is therefore conservative.
10.       The trucking company would be paid for its service after the fruit
has been delivered in Europe; 2 weeks' billings have been allowed as working
capital. The trucking company would pay correspondent haulers in Europe
for the Trieste/Koper and onward hauling.
Packing Houses and Cold Storages
11.       The packing house model would operate solely on a custom basis
charging existing rates. In practice, production companies would probably
own the packing houses for packing their own and others' fruit. The cost
figures for the packing plants and cold storages are based on consultants'
studies and on existing facilities in Turkey. The packing plant includes
necessary degreening and fumigation rooms, but the precooling would be done
on a custom basis by the cold storages. Since rates for this service do not
currently exist, these have had to be estimated. The cold storages would
also store fruit for exporters wishing to extend their selling season. For
table grapes, for example, the German wholesale price is generally 15% to
20% higher at two months after the end of the season, an amount sufficient to
encourage some traders to store fruit for later sale. Storage rates used
are lowest quoted existing rates. The packing house is only moderately
sensitive to a drop in throughput; a 10% decline in throughput reduces the
rate of return by 4 percentage points (from 23% to 19%). Appendix 13-5
shows a model cold storage facility with a storage capacity of 3,000 tons.
Revenues have been estimated on a very conservative basis, consisting of
storing about 4,500 tons of various products and the precooling of 25,000
tons of table grapes, satsumas and other produce. The estimated financial
rate of return is 19%. A drop in throughput of 10% would lower the rate of
return by about 4 percentage points.
On-Farm Citrus Development
12.       Cash-flow projections have been made for lemon, mandarins, orange
and grapefruit orchards. The models for lemons and other species were based
on actual yields attained by better farmers in Turkey. Farm-gate prices were
computed, in the case of lemons, mandarins and grapefruit, from prices
projected for the European market (Annex 12) and deducting all necessary
export costs including a profit to the exporter. For oranges (expected to
be marketed domestically) averages for 1969-70 were used. Since domestic
orange prices have been increasing more rapidly than prices of foodstuffs
generally, this approach is conservative. Costs are based on a farm survey
carried out in 1969-70 by the Ministry of Agriculture. Figures for the net
return from the crop displaced (cotton) are from actual experience in the
Lower Seyhan Project. The model shown is for 2 ha. orchard planted as part
of a 10 ha. irrigated cotton farm, about average for the area. The proposed
financing arrangement would provide the farmer with an adequate cash income
during the development period. The exporter negotiates a price on the tree



ANNEX 13
Page 4
and is responsible for picking, packing and transport. The farmer's operat-
ing costs are the same regardless of size of crop; accordingly, a percentage
drop in yield or price will have the same effect on rate of return. For
lemons, one of the lower rates of return, a 10% drop in projected yield or
price would reduce the rate of return by about 3 percentage points to 13%
which is still acceptable.
Production Company
13.       In order to determine the profitability of the total export
activity a proforma statement for a typical exporter was analyzed. This
exporter does not itself own and operate facilities financed by the credit
but buys fruit and uses the facilities on a custom basis to export at a
profit. The analysis showed that the export of fruit and vegetables from
Turkey to Western Europe would be a profitable undertaking.
Agricultural Bank of Turkey (ABT)
14.       A projected cash flow for the project account of the ABT was
analyzed. ABT would not have to employ any of its own funds. This stems
from: (1) Government contribution of TL 90 million (US$6 million) over the
disbursement period, (2) early disbursements on transport equipment which
is financed 1002 by Bank/IDA (because it is all foreign exchange) but requires
only an 802 ABT net disbursement, and (3) early disbursements on road transport
which has a rapid repayment period.  The net cash flow is adequate to cover
conceivable slippage in collections.

FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EXPORT PROJECT
Economic Rates of Return
1.        The economic rates of return (Appendix 14-1) of the project
component are as follows:
Ferry ships                        38%
Towing units and trailers          35
Export-handling facilities         34
On-farm citrus development         20
The overall economic rate of return for the project is about 27%.
2.        In computing the economic rate of return, for each sub-project a
pro-rata share of technical services was included as a cost; while income
taxes and taxes on fuel were excluded.
3.        The economic rate of return for the ferry ships is the same as the
financial rate of return adjusted for the changes outlined above and for the
additional benefit of lower truck rates due to the cost-savings provided by
the ferries. To the extent that lower truck rates than those currently in
effect may, through competition, extend to all traffic and not just that
carried by the ferry ships, this benefit provided by the ferry ships is
measured conservatively. The rate of return was analyzed for capacity
utilization of the ferry ships; a 20% reduction in volume reduces the rate
of return by 10 percentage points, to 23%.
4.        For the towing units and trailers the economic rate of return is
the financial rate adjusted for taxes and the cost of technical services.
This approach assumes that the towing units and trailers replace imported
trucking services. To the extent that this foreign transport may not
continue to be available the rate of return may be understated.
5.        The economic benefit of the export handling facilities is the price
differential in export markets that the improved facilities and practices
provide over what the exports would have yielded without these facilities.
Turkish exports often fetch lower prices than the fruit of competitors
employing superior facilities and practices. This differential has been
estimated at US$20 per ton (para 5.3) from which commissions and tariffs
have been deducted in computing the increased value to Turkey (i.e.
approximately US$18 per ton). On the cost side, the incremental cost of
packing and handling the marketed produce has been taken into account.

6.        In the on-farm citrus development, a shadow rate for labor, at 75%
of existing rate's, was employed to reflect the existence of surplus labor in
the project area. A similar approach was followed in the Intensive Dairy
Project. Costing labor at 100% would decrease the economic rate of return
by less than I percentage point.
7.        In valuing costs and benefits, the current official exclhange rate
was used. In that most of the projects' outputs are export-oriented, a
higher exchange rate would increase the economic rates of return.
