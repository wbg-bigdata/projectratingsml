A: Project Development Objectives
1. Project development objectives and key performance indicators (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
(i ) to improve transport efficiency on the road network; (ii) to continue reducing traffic congestion and providing more
efficient, safe and reliable road transport services in Panama City and other major cities in Panam; (iii) to continue the
improvement in MOP's capacity for the administration and maintenance of roads and of environmental impact analysis
started under the ongoing Roads Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3686-PA); and (iv) to improve the efficiency in the public
road passenger transport industry, through technical assistance to reorganize the public bus transport system.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 13846-PAN    Date of latest CAS discussion: 02/07/95
The 1995 CAS for Panamna focuses on reviving sustainable growth and on poverty alleviation. For economic revival, the
CAS recognizes the restoration and provision of infrastructure services, including road transport, as one of the key tools.
The proposed project would continue ongoing efforts to restore primary roads and urban streets and extend them to the
secondary road network. A new CAS under preparation and scheduled for review by the Executive Directors in June/July
1998, also accords priority to infrastructure development, including road transport.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The main sector issues include: (i) high road transport costs due to the deteriorated state of the road network and city
streets; (ii) restriction to entry in the trucking business in the Colon Free Zone; (iii) excessive traffic congestion in the
Panama Metropolitan Area where more than 50% of the country's GDP is generated; (iv) inadequate coordination of
transport sector investments; (v) unreliable maintenance funding; and (vi) relatively weak institutional capacity for
environmental assessment of transport investments. To restore the road network and city streets, the Government has given
priority to rehabilitating the road network and is implementing a road and city streets rehabilitation program with the
assistance of the Bank and the IDB, but still has a substantial backlog to remove . To improve competition in trucking, the
Government intends to draft, with financing under the proposed Public Policy Reform and Technical Assistance Project,
and enact a law liberalizing the trucking business, including that in the Colon Free Zone. The Government in February 1998
reached agreement with its neighboring countries to liberalize inter-country trucking. To improve traffic flow in Panama
City, the Government is financing, under the ongoing Road Rehabilitation Project (RRP), improvements to various critical
intersections and key congested avenues, the introduction of a modern traffic signaling system and the analysis of various
options for improving public passenger transport in Panama City. On transport investmnents and policy coordination, the
government has established a Transport Sector Coordinating Unit (TSCU) under MOP to coordinate all transport sector
investments, but, because ministries other than MOP control the transport modal agencies, e.g. the Ministry of Commerce
controls ports and railways, the Ministry of Defense controls civil aviation and the Ministry of Government and Justice
controls the road transport industry and regulations, the TSCU has been unable to coordinate the modal agencies'
investments properly. Partly because of this, the Government has decided to group all land transport planning and
management activities under a single entity to be named and this entity would incorporate the TSCU. Progress on this is
being monitored under the ongoing RRP. To ensure sufficient and reliable maintenance funding, the Government has
undertaken to maintain its maintenance allocations at the high levels experienced over the past 3 years. To strengthen the
institutional capacity for environmental assessment: the Government has created an environmental unit (UA) in MOP and
prepared guidelines for the environmental assessment of transport investments under the RRP and train_d staff.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
(i) High transport costs: will be reduced ftrough the road and streets rehabilitation component of the project;
(ii) Excessive traffic congestion in Panama City: will be alleviated through the urban streets and intersections improvement
component, the technical assistance for traffic management and the technical assistance for the reorganization of public
passenger transport; and
(iii) Unsteady maintenance funding: The Government has agreed, as a loan covenant (see section G.2), to maintain its road
maintenance allocations at their currently high levels; and



(iv) environmental assessment capacity: the new project will provide additional technical assistance and training to support
the development of the UA.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms to be sought are:
(i) improvement of road maintenance management through the introduction of a road management system; (ii) assistance for
the reorganization of urban public passenger transport: and (iii) continued assistance and training in dealing with
environmental and social issues.
3. Benefits and target population
The main benefits will be: (i) reduced transport costs on the selected roads and city; and (ii) reduced transport costs and
time savings to Panama City road users. Other benefits would be a temporary increase in employment directly associated
with road rehabilitation works.
The target population will be the country as a whole which will benefit from a better administered and maintained road
system.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation Period: Four and a half years (September 1998 to March 2003)
Executing Agency: Ministerio de Obras Publicas (MOP) which is implementing the ongoing RRP successfully.



Project Coordination: Unidad Especial Coordinadora del Programa del MOP (UECP) which has developed sufficient
capacity to coordinate MOP's ongoing US$730 million roads program.
Accounting. Financial. Reportine and Auditing Arrangements: (i) UECP will be responsible for project financial
management, using the accounting system currently being used for Loan 3686-PA. The Unit which has an experienced
chartered Public Accountant on its staff has been practicing sound financial management under sufficient internal controls
(see para. 2 under part E); (ii) MOP will submit to the Bank semi-annual financial statements, not later than July 31 and
January 31 each year during project implementation, starting in July 1999; (iii) project accounts, including the Special
Account and all disbursements under SOEs, will be audited annually, based on the Bank's Financial Accounting and
Reporting and Auditing Handbook (FARAH), published in January 1995, and the audit report submitted to the Bank not
later than six months after the end of each fiscal year.
Monitoring and Evaluation Arraneements: The UECP will submit semi-annual progress report on the project to the Bank
within one month of the end of each semester starting from June 30, 1999. The reports will describe: (i) progress during the
previous semester and performance against the project implementation schedule, as amended during the previous review,
and project performance indicators,: (ii) the level and composition of MOP's budget and availability of funds for the fiscal
year in which the review takes place; (iii) updated implementation and disbursement schedules for the following semester;
and (iv) a summary of the involvement and impact of MOP's Environmental Unit (EU) in MOP's road activities.
MOP will recruit a consultant/expert to carry out an independent environmental audit of MOP's roads activities. These
annual audits will form part of the annual implementation review.
The Bank will carry out about 3 full supervision missions annually. One of these, in September/October of each year, will
serve as an annual review of project implementation and planning for the following year's activities. In September/October
2000, the Government and the Bank will conduct a mid-term review of progress in implementation, which in addition to the
items to be covered during the annual reviews, would focus on: (i) progress made on institutional development; (ii) progress
made on physical implementation; (iii) the extent of MOP's Environnmotal Unit's involvement in all phases of MOP's road
activities; and (iv) the extent of institutionalizing the maintenance management system in MOP. An average of about 15
staff weeks per year will be required for supervising the project during its first two years while the ongoing Roads
Rehabilitation Project is being implemented. Thereafter, an average of about 20 staff weeks per year will be required. MOP
will prepare an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) on the project within six months of the loan closing date of March
31, 2003.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Panama also has a need for significant investment in development feeder roads, but this subsector appears to have adequate
IDB financing. The Bank, therefore, decided it was reasonable to concentrate on supporting the ongoing primary roads and
streets rehabilitation program and extending it to high priority secondary and tertiary roads.



2. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed, ongoing and planned):

IP/DO Ratings: HS (Highly Satisfactory), S (Satisfactory), U (Unsatisfactoxy), HU (Highly Unsatisfactory)
3. Lessons learned and reflected in proposed project design are that:
(i) the Bank's standard documents to be used for procurement under the project were reviewed and agreed at negotiations to
avoid unnecessary delays during implementation; (ii) funds have been included under the project for works supervision since
MOP does not have enough qualified engineers to carry out the supervision of all its road program; and (iii) the investment
in strengthening the in-house environmental capability of MOP can yield enormous returns. MOP's Environmental Unit
(EU) has been strengthened under the ongoing RRP to a point where it has been increasingly playing its role of ensuring that
negative environmental impacts from MOP road activities are appropriately mitigated, and this unit is well positioned to
oversee the proposed Second Road Rehabilitation Program. Despite these improvements, the EU is nonetheless a young
body, which will benefit from further training and support under the proposed project, both to enhance its technical abilities
and help ensure that its recommendations are increasingly integrated into decision-making by the Ministry.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The Government has shown full support, both financially and administratively, for the implementation of the
ongoing project to which the proposed project would be a continuation. The Government has allocated the
necessary counterpart funds in a timely manner and complied well with loan covenants. The Government has
made several representations to Bank management to assist with the proposed project. As a show of its
ownership, the Government has financed consultants to prepare the proposed project with its own funds and has
played a considerable role in the project's design.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank has provided technical advice in the implementation of the institutional development and policy change
components of the ongoing RRP project, using its extensive, world-wide experience. The continuing need to further
privatize road maintenance, to reduce congestion in Panama City, to set up a road maintenance fund and to improve MOP's
environmental activities are all areas in which the Bank has wide experience in Latin America.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
[x] Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$89.9    million; ERR= 33%



Inter-urban Roads: An economic analysis for all the project's inter-urban roads has been carried out using the Bank's
HDM IIT model. The resulting ERRs range between about 12 to 50% which is satisfactory with an overall weighted average
of about 29%. City Streets: For the project's city streets, for which both rehabilitation and minor widening are planned, the
ERR's have been estimated by comparing the benefits due to reduced vehicle operating costs, from a better riding surface,
and from savings in travel time with the cost of the investments. The street rehabilitation and ., .lening yield ERRs ranging
between 38 to 102% with a weighted average of 56%.
Main Assumptions : The estimate of traffic on the roads is based on periodic counts by MOP supplemented by a three-day
count. Traffic growth has been assumed to be 3% based on historic growth figures supplied by MOP. The vehicle
operating costs (vocs) used in the analysis for the "with"and "without"cases are those resulting from the HDM IHI model
calibrated for Panama. The estimated costs of maintenance are based on actual MOP costs for such roads. The econormic
life of the road/street rehabilitation investments has been assumed to be 15 years.
Sensitivity Analysis: A sensitivity test of the variations in ERRs against possible 20% increase in investment costs and of
possible decrease of 20 % in benefits all indicate that the EFRRs remain above 12%. Switching values on the investment
costs increases and decreases in traffic and vehicle operating costs indicate that, in all cases, costs have to be increased by
at least 24% and benefits by at least 26% before the roads and streets are no more justifiable.
2. Financial (see Annex 5):
Financing Plan: The project's financing plan is shown on the cover sheet. The proposed loan of US$85.0 million would
cover about 69% of project cost; the Government would finance the remaining US$38.8 million, about 31%.
Financial Managenent Controls: based upon the CY1996 audit report, revised to take the Bank's comments into consideration, MOP
has an adequate financial management system and internal controls for that project The consultants recommended that MOP should
produce more timely financial statements and should have the project's accounting system computerized. Both recommendations are
being implemented. MOP has a chartered Accountant and an accounting assistant handling the project's finances, which is adequate
for the ongoing RRP. However, given the additional load that would be imposed by the proposed project and the proposed IDB-
financed roads rehabilitation project, MOP would need to hire an additional qualified accountant. The completion of the
computerization of the project's accounts and the setting up of similar accounts for the proposed project and the hiring of the
additional qualified accountant are conditions of loan effectiveness.
Project Costs: (details in Annex 3). Project costs are based on bids for similar works being carried out under the ongoing RRP. The
Govermnent agreed at negotiations to provide timely counterpart funds for the project. There are sufficient funds in the fiscal 1999
budget to fund the implementation of the project in that year. The Government would establish a Project Account in the Banco
Nacional de Panama or other commercial bank acceptable to the Bank with an initial deposit of US$1.5 million for the purpose of
depositing and managing the counterpart funds required to carry out the project, as a condition of loan effectiveness.
3. Technical Assessment:
The rehabilitation works included in the proposed project are similar to the ones being carried out under the ongoing RRP.
The works are not technically complex and well within the capability and capacity of the contractors, domestic and
expatriates, who have shown interest in such works in Panama. Each road or street to be included in the proposed project
has been carefully studies by MOP with the assistance of a consultant.
For the procurement of the works under the project, bids would be called for a combination of detailed design and
rehabilitation. Draft bidding documents incorporating this concept into the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents were
reviewed by a Bank procurement expert during negotiations. Final documents, incorporating the Bank's comments, were
agreed, in principle, at negotiations.
4. Institutional:
a. Executing agencies: MOP has significantly improved its capacity for maintenance management, environmental
assessment, procurement, urban transport planning and the economic analysis of projects using the HDM model under the
ongoing RRP. The proposed project would provide further assistance in these areas through technical assistance and staff
training. MOP has also reduced its staffing by about 20% through attrition. Lastly, MOP has sold/concessioned three of its
workshop in its efforts to out-source some of its services to the private sector.



b. Project management: MOP has been successfully implementing the US$720 million roads rehabilitation and
maintenance program being co-financed by the Bank and the IDB. Through the implementation of the program, MOP has
acquired in-house capacity to carry out the economic evaluation and environmental analysis of sub-projects. MOP is now
also fully farmiliar with the Bank's procurement procedures and has steadily reduced the time between the start of bidding
and the award of contracts.
5. Social:
The ongoing RRP concentrated on the rehabilitation of primary roads and Panama city streets. The proposed project would
extend the rehabilitation effort to secondary and tertiary roads which would have a more direct impact on poverty alleviation
in the rural areas. During project preparation, the beneficiary population was consulted and participated in the selection of
roads. A qualified social scientist, recruited by MOP to review the social aspects of the project, concluded that the proposed
project would not have any adverse social impacts, and would have the social benefit of providing better access for the
communities served by the roads..
6. Environmental assessment: Environmental Category [ ] A   [xl B   [1] C
The rehabilitation of the project roads and streets is not expected to cause any adverse environmental impacts since the
works are generally on the existing road aligniments. This conclusion by MOP's Environmental Unit, which carried out a
diagnosis of each road and street in the proposed project, tha. there would be no medium or long-term negative impacts and
that the short-term inpacts during construction would be prevented by sound contractor behavior, was verified by an
independent environmental expert retained by the Bank during project preparation.
MOP's bidding documents for Bank-financed works provide adequate specifications for contractor behavior during
construction, including the management of quarries and borrow pits, pollution control of construction equipment and crews
and disposal of waste materials.
Panama passed a new environmentai law (Law No. 41 of 1998) on July 1, 1998. The norms and procedures of the Bank
regarding environmental impact assessment and mitigation are consistent with the provisions of the law and will govern all
road investments in the Government's program, especially until the national Enviromnental Authority is constituted and the
regulations for the above law are in place.
By a letter of August 19, 1998, MIPPE has informed the Bank that it has required all line ministries and agencies to
conduct environmental impact assessments of their projects and have them approved by the National Environmental
Authority as a pre-condition to their being considered for approval by the National economic Council and/or by the Cabinet
In order to monitor compliance with sound environmental practice in the road sector and the progress in the development of
the envii omnental Unit (EU), the project provides for an annual environmental audit to be carried out by independent
consultants/experts of MOP's road activities for the previous year. These audits would be one of the foci of the annual
review meetings mentioned in Section G.2.
The project will also continue assistance in strengthening EU through staff training and the improvement in policies and
procedures for environmental and social impact assessments and mitigation and consultation with the civil society. The
training program, agreed with MOP during appraisal, will include: (a) social impact assessments, including involuntary
resettlement and indigenous issues, (b) organizing workshops and seminars for MOP staff, Panamanian civil engineering
consultants, road contractors and NGOs on managing social and environmental issues on roads and (c) sending at least 3
staff of the environmental unit on overseas training visits per year. The progress in the strengthening of EU will be
monitored as part of the abovementioned independent annual environmental audit.
7. Participatory approach.
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
The local population in the roads influence areas were briefed on the project and given an opportunity to participate in the
selection of roads to be screened for the project.



.F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The sustainability of the project will be determined by subsequent adequate maintenance of the rehabilitated roads and
streets and the continued application of the management systems and skills developed under the project. Regarding road
maintenance, the Government has increased its road maintenance funding from US$14 million in 1994 to about US$34
million in 1996, and more importantly, has been allocating the funds on time. The Government agreed at negotiations to
maintain its allocations to provide sufficient and stable funding for maintenance. With respect to the management
systems, MOP has so far put all the systems and training developed under the ongoing project to good use and is expected
to do the same with the ones under the proposedi project.

Panama Second Roads Rehabilitation Project
Detailed Project Description
PART A - ROADS AND STREETS REHABILITATION - US$121.0 MILLION
A.1 - Rehabilitation of Inter-urban Roads and Bridges - US$100.0 million
[Description of specific activities to be carried out under the component]
This component includes the rehabilitation of about 413 km of high priority primary, secondary and tertiary roads
and two bridges totaling about 280 m (see Table A). The works would include the re-enforcement of the
pavement structure or the provision of new surface treatment on stretches where the paved surface has completely
disappeared, the rehabilitation of shoulders and drainage structures and the provision of adequate road signs. The
rehabilitation would be carried out within the existing road alignment and therefore no land acquisition or
resettlement would be required.
A.2. Rehabilitation and Selected Improvement of Urban Roads and Intersections US$17.40 million
This component would finance the rehabilitation and spot improvement of 7 selected city streets, 2 intersections,
2 bridges totaling about 55 m and about 10 pedestrian overpasses in Panama City, C3lon, David, Santiago, Chitre,
Los Santos, Las Tablas and Cocle (see Table B). The street works would include re-enforcement of the pavement,
the widening of traffic lanes, rehabilitation and, in some cases, widening of shoulders and provision of curbs
within the existing right of way and the provision of adequate horizontal and vertical signs. The intersection
improvement would comprise the provision of special left and right turn lanes and road channelization.
A.3. Consulting Services for Supervision of Works - US$5.1 million
This component wvould finance the supervision of works by private consultants. The detailed engineering of
Components A. 1 and A2 would be combined with the works contracts.
A.4. Office Equipment for Preparation and Supervision of A. 1 and A.2 US$100,000
This component would finance the purchase of office equipment and measuring instruments for MOP to prepare
and supervise the implementation of the inter-urban roads and city streets components under A. 1 and A.2 above.
PART B. INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING - US$2.2 MILLION
Consulting Services for Technical Assistance and Training - US$2.2 million
This component would finance the continuation of technical assistance to MOP for improving maintenance
management and urban transport planning. Technical assistance for maintenance management would be in the
form of a consulting firm and individual short-term consultants for specific items. The urban transport planning
component would continue the assistance for public passenger transport re-organization being provided under the
ongoing RRP. The institutional strengthening component would also include technical assistance, to support and
further develop the Environmental Unit, as well as training on selected topics for MOP staff, including
environmental and social impact assessment and on roads land use in environmentally-sensitive areas, road
maintenance management and road concessions. This component will also finance annual environmental audits to
be carried out by independent consultants/experts.
Annual Program (1998 - 1999)
The annual program for 1998-1999 (Table C) was agreed at negotiations.

Panama Second Roads Rehabilitation Project
Cost Benefit Analysis Summary
(US$ 1998 Prices)
Background
1.    Panama's population is concentrated in the Panama City Metropolitan Area while its agricultural and livestock
produce is concentrated in the provinces quite removed from the major population centers. While most sections of the
Pan-American Highway (PAH), the main road axis linking the country east-west, have been and are being rehabilitated
under the ongoing Bank/IDB-financed Roads Rehabilitation Project (RRP), there are still important sections of the road
which remain to be rehabilitated. Moreover, the secondary and tertiary roads linking the PAH to the actual producing
areas and markets require urgent restoration to reduce the high transport costs of both agricultural produce and imports
into those areas which generally have low per capita income. The cost of transporting some of this produce on the existing
bad roads to the market centers in and near Panama City is very high, estimated to constitute as much as about 23% of the
total market price in Panama City. This transport cost could be reduced by up to 35% with the road rehabilitation under
the project. The project's inter-urban roads component comprises very deteriorated sections of the PAH and secondary
and tertiary roads emanating from it.
2.    The Panama City Metropolitan Area (PCMA) accounts for about over 40% of the country's population and over
50% of its GDP. The peripheral areas of the PCMA also have some of the poorest communities in Panama. Traffic within
the PCMA has become congested both due to the exceptionally high growth in the vehicle park ( about 3000 new entries
per month), inadequate traffic flow management, the poor condition of some major avenues and inadequate capacity at
some important intersections leading to high vehicle operating costs. The ongoing RRP has started to address these
problems, but there is much more ground to cover. The proposed project is aimed at continuing the efforts under the
ongoing RRP.
Summary of Benefits and Costs:
3.    The project's benefits would include: (a) improved access to markets and services for agricultural
producers; and (b) reduced transport costs on the   Only the benefits from (b), in the form of reduced vehicle operating
costs (voc) to road users and time savings in the case of the city streets and intersections, have been quantified for the
purposes of the economic analysis.
Economic Analysis
4.    Inter-urban roads. The economic analysis for the inter-urban roads was conducted as part of feasibility
studies carried out by MOP with the help of consultants using the Bank's HDM III model which is the conventional
approach for the type of works on the roads and the level of traffic (over 150 vehicles per day). Details of the results of
the feasibility studies are included in the Project Files; a summary of the results for a typical project road is included as
Attachment I to this annex. The ERRs for the project roads range between 12% and 50% with an overall return of 29%.
5.    City Streets. The economic analysis for the city streets employs the HDM-Q, which is the version of the
HDM model which can take into consideration effects. Based on savings in vehicle operating costs and time savings to
passengers and drivers of passenger vehicles, the city streets rehabilitation and selected improvements would yield an
ERR of 56%. The improvements in the intersections would increase the levels of service at the intersections thereby
reducing delays and accidents. Based on the quantification of the time savings to road users crossing those intersections,
the improvements would yield a combined rate of return of 39%. The economic returns for the pedestrian overpasses and
street signing (about 3% of total project costs) have not been estimated yet since there remains some questions on which
overpasses to build and no reliable method exists for calculating credible returns for street signing.



Traffic
6.    The traffic on the inter-urban roads, obtained by updating counts canied out by DINATRATE and
consultants Parsons and Brinkerhoff (USA), ranges between about 150 to 5750 vehicles per day. An average traffic
growth rates of 3% per year, based on historical growth rates, has been used in the analysis. For the city streets and
intersections, recent traffic counts by DINATRATE over the past three years have been updated and used. Traffic on the
city streets ranges between 8,500 to 18,000 vehicles per day and on the intersections from 12,000 to 25,000 in both
directions with an estimated growth rate of 4%/o.
Vehicle Operating Costs (vocs)
7.    The vocs used in the analysis are those incorporated in the HDM model, modified to reflect unit costs in
Panama. The benefits from the reduced vocs arise from the better riding surface following rehabilitation for inter-urban
roads and from both the improvement in the riding surface and the increased road and intersection traffic capacity, in the
case of the city streets. Typical voc reductions for the project road& range between 12% and 18% for passenger cars, 16 %
and 23% for pick-ups, 17% and 21% for busses and light trucks and 14% and 17% for articulated trucks.
Time Savings.
8.    The time savings have been considered only in the analysis of city streets and intersections. The HHDM-Q
estimates these time savings automatically as a function of traffic levels and composition, and the geometric design
standards of the existing and rehabilitated and improved road. The value of time is quantified separately for truck and bus
drivers and their mates and for taxi drivers- for whom the average full value of wages and compensation has been used -
and for private car drivers and their passengers - for whom the value of time is discounted.
Costs
9.    The rehabilitation of the individual inter-urban road sections, city streets and intersections would be in
line with the project implementation plan included in the Project File. Annual routine maintenance and resealing of the
roads, when the damage area reaches 50%, would be carried out both in the "with" and 'without" project cases. The
rehabilitation costs used in the analysis are based on unit prices received for similar works under the ongoing RRP. The
economic costs have been calculated as total costs minus taxes. No shadow prices have been used since the valuation of
costs and benefits are at undistorted market prices.
Summary Results
10.   The costs and benefit streams during the life-cycle of a typical inter-urban road are shown in Attachment
2 to this Annex. The overall ERRs and Net Present Values (NPV) for the three major components of the project are listed
below:
Inter-urban Roads                    84.8                   29%                     63.2
City Streets and Bridges             17.2                   56%                     18.1
Intersections                         6.5                   41%                      8.6
Totals                               108.5                  33%                     89.9



Sensitivity analysis / Switching values of critical items:
11.    A sensitivity analysis has been carried out for each road section, street and intersection to be included
under the project assuming reasonably likely variations in costs and benefits. The result show 'iat the proposed works
under the project remain economically justifiable with a cost increase of 20% or a decrease in benefits of 20%. Switching
values on the investment cost increas, and decreases in vehicle operating cost indicates that in all cases by, at least, 24%
and the benefits have to be reduced by at least 26% before the road sections become economically non-justifiable.

extent practicable, contracts for works will be grouped into bid packages to cost the equivalent of US$4 million or
more and awarded through ICB. Civil works valued at more than US$100,000 but less than US$4 million per
package or contract and not exceeding an aggregate of US$30 million will be procured through national
competitive bidding (NCB) procedures satisfactory to the Bank using standard bidding documents agreed with the
Bank. Work contracts of less than US$ 100,000 and not exceeding an aggregate of US$ 1.1 million will be
awarded on the basis of proposals obtained from at least three qualified domestic contractors. All bidding
documents for works will include specifications to safeguard the environment during construction. instruments,
materials, and office equipment with a cost of more than US$200,000 will be procured using ICB; individual
contracts costing between US$25,000 and US$200,000 and not exceeding US$1.2 million in aggregate will be
procured by NCB procedures; and individual contracts costing less than US$25,000 and not exceeding in
aggregate US$400,00 by national and international shopping procedures. Bidders for works and goods estimated
to cost more than the equivalent of US$ 10 million and US$2 million respectively, would be pre-qualified using
standard documents agreed with the Bank.
3.    Consultants for studies, work supervision and technical assistance will be selected and engaged
following the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants, dated January 1997 and revised in September 1997.

methods for consultancies under the required conditions: (a) Quality and Cost-Based Selection; (b) Quality-Based
Selection; and (c) Selection under a fixed budget.

4.    All ICB contracts and the first NCB contracts for works and goods will be subject to the Bank's prior
review. For works contracts of less than US$100,000, and goods contracts less than US$25,000, the first two
contracts will be subject to the Bank's prior review. Contracts for consulting services valued at US$100,000 or
more each for consulting firms and of more than US$50,000 for individuals will be subject to the Bank's prior

Annex 12
Panama Second Roads Rehabilitation Project
Institutional strengthening of MOP
A. Under the Ongoing Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program
1.     The institutional strengthening of .AOP (Ln. 3686-PA), being co-financed under MOP's Roads Rehabilitation and
Maintenance Program by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the World Bank, is directed towards improving seven
broad areas of MOP's operations: (i) MOP's capacity to efficiently manage its large (US$730 million) road rehabilitation and
maintenance program; (ii) road maintenance and highway administration; (iii) environmental analysis, assessments and mitigation in
road activities; (iv) management of urban passenger transport, especially in the Panama City Metropolitan Area; (v) procurement
procedures; (vi) control of vehicle weight and dimensions; and (vii) coordination of transport investments and policies.
2.     On the balance, the results so far have been very significant except in transport coordination and re-organization of public
urban passenger transport where progress has been slow, as detailed below.
Managing MOP's Road Programs.
3.     Under Ln. 2686-PA! a Special Program Coordinating Unit (Unidad Especial Coordinadora del Programa, UECP) has been
established which, with technical assistance under the project, has gradually developed the capacity to manage efficiently the ongoing
US$730 million RRP. The Unit has an experienced senior engineer as coordinator, three qualified engineers, a qualified accountant
and an assistant accountant, a lawyer/institutional development expert and an adequate number of support staff, vehicles and office
equipment. Under the proposed project, the unit will recruit an additional qualified accountant and computerize its accounting system,
to strengthen the unit's financial management capacity.
Improving Road Maintenance.
4.     The efforts have been directed at introducing a modern maintenance management system, increasing road maintenance
funding and carrying out maintenance more efficiently by contracting out to th.s private sector.
5.     Maintenance Management With ongoing technical assistance, maintenance management is being improved through the
establishment of a highway data bank and of a pavement management unit based on the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance
model (HDM III). Still to be established under the proposed new project, to complete the system are the monitoring and evaluation of
maintenance performance and the completion and linking of the data bank to all operational units of MOP. These will be done under
the proposed Second Roads Rehabilitation Project.
6.     Road Maintenance Funding has been increased from about US$14.7 million, the first year of the ongoing roads rehabilitation
project, to an average of about US$35 million per year thereafter. The ongoing project funded a study for the establishment of a road
fund for maintenance the recommendations of which are still being reviewed by the Government. The study recommended an annual
spending for routine and periodic maintenance of about US$50 million after the entire network has been brought up to a maintainable
state. The recommended funding of US$45 million a year for maintenance over the next five years is based upon this figure. The
study has provided the framework for establishing a road maintenance fund.
7.     Using Private Contractors and Local Community Groups for Road Maintenance. Technical assistance under the ongoing
project has helped to introduce into MOP various forms of road maintenance by contract, including maintenance by medium-sized
contractors under unit-priced contracts, maintenance of specific road sections by experienced contractors using maintenance by
standards and maintenance contracts with local community groups. All three forms are currently being used by MOP. MOP has also
started to include 3 to 5-year contracts with its road rehabilitation contracts to both ensure that subsequent maintenance is established
at the onset and that the rehabilitation works are carried out properly, a sound innovation for Panama. MOP's efforts to increase the
share of private contractors in maintenance has been and will continue to be below the rather ambitious 75% target agreed under the
ongoing project which was unrealistic. A more realistic target will be about 50% over the next four years
Improving Environmental Analysis/Assessments and Mitigation
8.     The ongoing roads rehabilitation project has helped to: (i) establish and staff an environmental unit (UA) in MOP; (ii)
developed guidelines for environmental assessment and impact mitigation; (iii) apply these guidelines to analyze and mitigate the
environmental impacts of the civil works under the ongoing roads rehabilitation and maintenance program; and (iv) to conduct



consultants have been hired first to-do the design and contractors subsequently to undertake the construction. The proposed project
will incorporate this concept for the road rehabilitation works which are simple.
Improving the Control of Vehicle Weights and Dimensions
16.    The IDB has financed an expert, under the ongoing roads rehabilitation program, to assist MOP in improving the control of
vehicle weights and dimensions and is helping to also purchase weigh bridges and to improve weighing stations. The Bank's ongoing
project has assisted with logistics for the mobile weigh bridges. The assistance has helped MOP to significantly improve its control of
overloading on the road network.
Coordination of Transport Sector Investments and Policies.
17.    The Bank and IDB ongoing projects were expected to assist the Government in developing the framework and capacity to
coordinate transport planning and policy formulation, the responsibility for which is currently dispersed among five ministries.
Although a Transport Sector Coordination Unit has been created and almost fully staffed in MOP, the unit has been essentially non-
operational since MOP has no statutory authority over the transport modes handled by the other ministries. The Government has
recently drafted a law which would at least put the responsibility for road transport operations under one, rather the current two,
ministries, and is discussing it with the transport operators. The problem for at least the road sector is expected to be solved under the
ongoing Bank project. The Government has, since the establishment of the TSCU, moved to concession the railways and major ports
and is moving to privatize the international airport thus reducing the need for coordinating transport investments centrally, but
creating an even greater need for a regulatory framework and body for the sector.
B. Institutional Strengthening Under the Proposed Bank and IDB Projects
18.    The institutional strengthening under the two proposed projects will be aimed mostly at consolidating the extensive efforts
started under the ongoing program and expanding gradually into new areas. Of importance would be: (i) completing the introduction
of the road maintenance management with the completion of the data bank and installation of the monitoring and evaluation
components of the system; (ii) expanding the use of community groups in the maintenance of outlying roads in the network and the
use of local contractors for maintenance; (iii) developing guidelines for the assessment of the social impacts of roads and training
MOP staff in their use as well as providing further training, through environmental seminars, workshops and training visits, to MOP
staff; and (iv) providing assistance to the Government to implement the re-organization of public urban passenger transport and other
traffic management measures.
