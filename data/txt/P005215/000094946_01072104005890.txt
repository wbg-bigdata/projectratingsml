3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
3.11   The primary objective of the project was to decrease load shedding through a combination of
system expansion, efficiency improvements, load management, and price adjustments as well as
preparation of sector reform. This would be accomplished through the addition of 200 MW of capacity, by
converting the existing gas turbines at Ghom to a combined cycle plant, 230 kV sub-stations and



transmission lines, distribution equipment, price reform measures, and technical assistance and training
activities.
3.12   By 1990, the growth in power demand of about 1,000 MW p.a. in Iran and the persistent load
shedding problem led the Ministry of Energy (MOE) to initiate a number of generation projects. By 1996,
about 6,000 MW of new generation capacity was planned to become operational. This would
significantly narrow the supply/demand gap. Industrial growth over the near term might be considerable
as capacity utilization in existing industries increased, which would require a quick supply response by
the power sector. Within this context, the project was designed to have a relatively short gestation
period so that the load shedding problem would be quickly addressed.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Not Applicable.
3.3 Original Components:
3.31   Ghom Conversion and Combined Cycle (US$204.2 million; highly satisfactory rating). An
unserved energy demand was estimated to be about 2,000 GWh in 1991, representing an economic loss
of US$100 million equivalent. The war with Iraq had prevented the timely building of new infrastructure
to meet the growing demand. Power shortages were also caused by a mixture of inadequate generating
capacity reserve, transmission limitations, fuel shortages, and water limitations at hydro plants. Based
on demand forecasts that considered the projected increase in tariffs, an optimization of the expansion of
the generated capacity of the interconnected system was carried out during project preparation. The
results of the subsequent analysis indicated that the addition of 200 MW of capacity, by converting the
existing gas turbines at the Ghom Power Plant to a combined cycle plant, formed part of the least-cost
expansion needed to resolve the load shedding problem.
3.32   Transmission Lines and Substation (US$80.2 million; highly satisfactory rating). As part of the
strengthening of the north-south links of the interconnected system, a 230 kV substation and a 230/400
kV transmission line would connect the power plant to the national grid.
3.33   Studies and Training (US$4.5 million; satisfactory rating). Technical assistance would support
the formulation of detailed measures for restructuring the power sector by providing financing for studies
and training. Such measures, which were in line with the Government's "Statement of Power Sector
Development Policy," would encompass, inter alia, divestiture of ancillary units (e.g., maintenance) to
the private sector, a regulatory framework for power enterprises, environmental standards, and price
reform measures that would take into account the Long-Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) of electricity
production.
3.4 Revised Components:
Not applicable.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
3.51   The detailed engineering design of the combined cycle add-on at the Ghom plant began in
November 1991 on the basis of an earlier feasibility study. The study also indicated that the site
conditions based on geotechnical and seismic investigations were appropriate. The appraisal mission, in
January 1992, reviewed a preliminary engineering design report (Phase I). On the basis of that report,
the detailed engineering designs (Phase II) were completed in 1992 making it possible for bidding
documents for the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) and steam turbine generator (STG) packages
to be issued in February 1993. Terms of reference for studies had also been drafted. A well designed
project was therefore ready for implementation by the time of Board approval.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
4.11   The main project objective and associated physical outputs were achieved in their entirety and
according to design. Conversion of an existing power plant from gas turbines to combined cycle
operations, fired by natural gas (main fuel) and gas oil (stand-by fuel), added about 200 MW of capacity,
in keeping with the Government's priority to address the load shedding problem. A 230 kV substation
was built and a 400 kV transmission line installed to connect the power plant to the national grid.
4.12   The project's technical assistance objectives were only partially met by the loan closing date; the
outputs were nonetheless substantial and work on the two main studies continues by the Government. A
long-term strategy was formulated in the first phase of the Power Sector Restructuring Study. It included
a structure for the industry and a framework for both public and private sector involvement. The second
and final phase, pending the approval of high-level decision makers, is intended to present a phased
implementation plan. The multi-modular Energy Sector Development Study assessed the resource
needs (fossil fuels, hydro power, investment capital and management resources) and will culminate in
the formulation of a coherent policy and comprehensive strategy for developing and financing future
energy needs. A third study, aimed to upgrade the efficiency of existing thermal plants, was financed
entirely by the Government outside the project scope, and its related financing from the loan was
cancelled.
4.13   Operator training was intended for specialized functions, such as gas turbine maintenance and
combined cycle plant operation, as well as for human resource development programs for engineers,
chemists, and technicians. The related diagnostic study and subsequent project-related training activities
were cancelled when MOE decided to use own funds within the framework of its overall human resource
development scheme.
4.14   Price reform measures were only partially effective. In Iran, the low fuel costs coupled with low
debt service requirements have led to a distortion in electricity pricing. The Government was sensitive
to this issue and resolved to set tariffs at a rate that would allow the sector to be fully self-financing and
reflect the LRMC of producing electricity. By 1993, cost recovery reached 20 percent of the LRMC; by
2000, a series of tariff revisions resulted in about 55 percent of the LRMC. A rational pricing policy is
one of the primary aims of the Energy Sector Development Study, and is yet to be developed.
4.2 Outputs by components:
4.21   Power Plant Conversion. The power plant is situated 15 km from Ghom and 150 km to the
south of Tehran. It is operated by the Tehran Regional Electric Company (TREC), the Borrower of
record. At the time of project appraisal, four 100 MW (site rating) open cycle gas turbine (GT) units were
being installed and commissioned in 1993. These four GTs were converted into two combined cycle
(CC) modules providing an additional total capacity of 200 MW. Under the conversion scheme, unfired
HRSGs were installed at the exhaust of each GT. Using the heat from exhaust gases of GT units, two
HRSGs produce enough steam to operate a Steam Turbine Generator (STG) unit of about 100 MW
capacity. Hence the total capacity of the two combined cycle modules is 600 MW gross (588 MW net)
when power consumed by the auxiliaries has been deducted. The expected overall efficiency is about
45 percent, compared with 32 percent for the open cycle mode. The scheme is operated as a base load
station with an expected capacity utilization factor of no less than 70 percent. The primary fuel for the
gas turbines is natural gas with gas oil as the stand-by fuel. A 15-day reserve capacity of gas oil is
available in a storage tank at the plant site to account for any shortages in gas supply. The 200 MW
combined cycle add-on requires no additional fuel. From an environmental standpoint, it is noteworthy
that there was no confiscation of land for the upgrade of the generation facility and that the plant uses a
dry cooling system, i.e., air cooled condensers, to minimize the water supply needs.

4.22   Tender documents were issued under ICB in February 1993. Letters of credit for the two large
contracts for a total of US$140 million equivalent were opened and became effective in September
1994 following a four-month delay. By the end of that year, over 90 percent of the Bank loan was
committed. The HSRG and STG units were converted to two combined cycle modules, with a total
nominal site rating of 600 MW. With some slippage of less than one year, STGs unit 1 and 2 were
synchronized in June 1997 and March 1998 respectively. Final Acceptance Certificates for both units
were issued on December 31, 2000.
4.23 Transmission Lines and Substation. The Ghom substation is located about 10 km to the
southwest of the city. The works related to the substation include a 230 kV switchgear,
auto-transformers, necessary relay protection, AC/DC systems, and control measures. Two 400 kV
single circuit lines are connected to this substation. Following commissioning of the open cycle plant, the
output was connected to the interconnected system via 230 kV transmission lines . With the conversion
to CC operation at Ghom, plant output was connected to the national interconnected system via 230 kV
and 400 kV transmission lines. This component comprising of the substation and transmission lines (220
and 400 kV) was financed locally. In addition, IBRD loan financed about 15 km of 230 kV underground
cable, which was installed to enhance the reliability of the transmission system and enable a better
evacuation of power from the Ghom plant to the 230 kV national grid. From an environmental
standpoint, there was no confiscation or disturbance of land necessary for the transmission lines, since
they were built on existing right-of-way.
4.24   Distribution Eauipment. Hardware and software were installed at TREC for customer billing and
collections, management information and accounfing systems, and distribution planning systems. In
addition, equipment for ten energy audit buses were purchased from the loan.
4.25   Power Sector Restructuring Study. The Iranian electricity market is absent of competition,
enterprise autonomy is weak, an incentive structure is missing, and there is little accountability.
Accordingly, Phase I of the restructuring study comprised a diagnosis and evaluation of institutional
options. It was completed in 1999, five years behind schedule, but with significant findings and
recommendations in the form of a policy orientation paper. Referred to as the "Power Restructurng
White Paper," the document was discussed in-depth at an industry-wide workshop held in 1999 in
Tehran. Subsequently, MOE endorsed the proposed strategy with some modifications, but it also pointed
out that a full consensus among all decision makers concerned would have to be reached before
adopting the strategy and starting Phase II. In the meantime, to advance the arguments necessary to
convince all the interested parties, MOE ordered a comparative analysis of industry structures in other
countries at similar stages of development. The Government intends to continue with Phase II which will
consist of the development of a blueprint in the form of a phased implementation strategy plan.
4.26   Enerav Sector Develooment Study. The study various modules cover macroeconomic analysis
(i.e., energy demand and supply, pricing and income analysis, subsidies), regional development of
energy resources, investment and financing requirements, environmental analysis, and development of a
statistical model. A dispute between MOE and the foreign firm over non-payment of consultant fees
disrupted progress in completing the study in its final stages but it is back on track. So far the study has
produced an outflow of highly useful data and analyses.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
4.31   At appraisal, the economic rate of return (ERR) on the investment in the project was estimated at
about 17%, and the present value of net benefits (NPV) to be realized from the project at a 10% discount
rate, as a reflection of the long-term opportunity cost of capital to Iran, was about US$140.6 million
equivalent irn year 2000 prices. At project completion, the ERR is estimated to be about 15% and NPV of
about US$84.2 million in year 2000 prices. In both cases, the ERR is higher than the long-term
opportunity cost of capital, which confirms the Project's net positive contribution to the economy.
4.32   The estimates sre based on quantifiable economic costs and benefits of the Project. The costs
comprise capital and fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs. Fuel cost is not taken into
- 4 -



account since it is not an incremental cost to the Project. The benefit consists of incremental electricity
sales to final consumers, valued at the average electricity tariff as a reflection of the consumers'
willingness to pay for electricity. At appraisal, the average electricity price was assumed to increase
gradually from Rls37.9/kWh (USCents 1.4/kWh) in 1993 to about Rls135/kWh (USCents 4.5/kWh) by
1997 and to be maintained at that level in real terms thereafter in accordance with the Second Five Year
Development Plan. However, the expected tariff adjustments did not materialize. At the time of the
ICR, the average electricity tariff had reached only Rlsl 14.3/kWh(USCents 3.81/kWh). This is the main
reason for the difference in the appraisal and ICR estimates of the ERR. Details of computations are
provided in Annex 3. The following Table presents the summary results.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
4.41   A financial rate of return was not required in 1993, when the project was presented to the Board
4.5 Institutional development impact:
4.51   The project was instrumental in bringing TREC's financial management up to an acceptable
standard. At the onset of the project, the company was still using manual accounting methods dating
back to 1965. These methods were supplemented by a computerized system mainly for accounts
receivable, billing, and inventory. The initial audit report required by the Bank indicated a high number
of serious accounting deficiencies. TREC undertook actions in collaboration with its World Bank
counterparts, a local financial consultant in particular, that dramatically improved its overall financial
management These actions consisted of:
(a) requesting that the auditors issue a management letter annually and forward a copy to the Bank
together with the TREC management's comments thereon and an action plan;
(b) appointing five accounting firms to correct noted deficiencies in its major accounts, which culminated
in audit opinions for 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 with increasingly fewer and far less serious qualifications;
(c) engaging a management consultant to set up a computerized accounting information system;
(d) carrying out training programs to introduce new accounting standards in effect in Iran since 1999
and the World Bank's financial accounting and auditing requirements, which TREC's Finance
Department had translated into Farsi;
(e) undertaking a first revaluation of its fixed assets in 1993, which was completed in 1994, and a
second revaluation in 2000/2001 to conform with the new Budget Law, which was also aimed at
regularizing all capital expenditure accounts; and
(f) preparing financial projections, beginning in 1995, and eventually appointing and adequately training
one staff from its Budget Department and another from its Finance Department to carry out these
projections on a regular basis.
5.52   The latest audit report (1999/2000), together with the management report, shows improvements
in TREC's accounting systems; however, a number of deficiencies remain. These are being addressed
through an action plan with follow-up by the company's internal auditors. TREC's financial position is
good. The company has also reduced outstanding accounts receivable to an average of three months.
Because of low debt service requirements as well as low operating expenses due to low fuel costs, the
- 5 -



company has easily met the required self-financing ratio of 40 percent and debt service coverage ratio
of 1.5. The Energy Sector Development Study addresses the issue of distortions caused by improper
fuel pricing.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
5.11   The contract for the Power Sector Restructuring Study was signed with a consortium led by a
US firm. Following submission of the inception report, the US firm was barred from continuing with the
undertaking pursuant to the terms of the US-imposed embargo and requested that the contract be
terminated. Likewise, economic sanctions severely limited the number of potential suppliers of goods.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
5.21   Low natural gas and heavy fuel oil prices allowed TREC substantially to finance its own
investments. However, annual tariff adjustments exceeding the rate of inflation will be needed in order
for tariffs to reflect the long-run marginal cost of producing electricity.
5.22   TREC's customer accounts have been reduced to about three months of billing. While
significant improvement in collecting outstanding balances from private customers has been made,
arrears owed by Government entities continue to increase.
5.23   The Government's policy on hiring of foreign consultants and resultant non-payment for services
rendered hampered completion of the Energy Sector Development Study.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
5.31   With its competent managers, engineers, and other administrative and operational personnel,
TREC is in an excellent position to: (a) operate and maintain the Ghom power plant efficiently; and (b)
apply sound financial management practices, including the use of national accounting standards and the
use of state-of-the-art information technology.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
5.42   The actual project cost, including interest during construction, was US$258.80 million equivalent,
which is 62 percent of the appraisal estimate (US$414.0 million). For the project's main component, the
combined cycle conversion, the actual cost was US$162.5 million, which was about 20.4 percent lower
than the original base cost (US$204 million). The total project cost (US$218.9 million) was about 57
percent lower than the base cost plus physical and price contingencies. The actual engineering and
project management cost are at 60 percent of the estimated cost.
5.43   Successful competitive bidding obviated the need for foreign supplier credits. Savings in foreign
costs, boosted by the fluctuation of exchange rates involving the US dollar, German mark, and Iranian
rial, enabled TREC to purchase a 230 kV underground cable and additional spare parts, neither of which
had been included in the original project cost estimates. Approximately US$8 million will be cancelled
from the IBRD loan account With respect to the local financing, the actual cost for installing the
transmission lines and substation was US$20.8 million equivalent, about one-fourth of the original
estimate, owing to the devaluation of the rial in relation to the dollar.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
-6 -



6.11   The likelihood that the project will maintain its achievements hinges mainly on TREC's
continuing technical and managerial effectiveness, as well as its future financial viability.  Notably, the
company's management remains committed to the reforms carried out under the project. In the absence
of a follow-on operation that would permit the company to benefit from an ongoing dialogue with the
Bank, TREC has taken the initiative to engage two local consulting firms to upgrade its software for
accounting and financial control and set up an integrated information system. This is a positive sign that
the company will continue to seek advice and assistance, as needed, from extemal sources to enable it
continuously to improve its technical competence and management efficiency, as well as replace
outdated software programs.
6.12   The implementation of the final recommendations of the Power Sector Restructuring Study and
the Energy Sector Development Study should provide the enabling environment needed to promote and
sustain growth in the Iranian power industry.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
6.21   As the Borrower points out in its completion report, the Ghom Combined Cycle Power Plant is
now operating as one of the base load power stations within Iran's national grid. It currently generates
600-700 MW running on natural gas. It can convert to gas oil in an emergency.
6.22   TREC will monitor the following performance indicators on a regular basis:
(a)    measurement of the corrected and adjusted total power generation from Ghom Combined Cycle
plant (MW);
(b)    measure of the energy generated (MWh);
(c)    calculation of the corrected heat rate (kJ/kWh);
(d)    annual availability of the plant for the gas turbine portion, steam outline portion, and whole plant
(%;
(e)    annual reliability of each portion and whole plant (%);
(f)    measurement of the auxiliary consumption and losses of both portions and whole plant in
percentage to the total generation (%);
(g)    measurement of make-up water consumption per each one MWh of energy generation from the
steam portion (kg/MWh);
(h)    measurement of the gas emission from the plant GT and steam (PPM); and
measurement of the noise level (dB).
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
7.11   Bank staff involved in project preparation ensured that procurement arrangements were well
defined and tender documents ready to be issued prior to Board presentation. They also paid close
attention to demand forecasts and environmental concerns. Above all, they aimed to attain a high level
of efficiency in electricity generation, as evidenced by the rehabilitation of an existing plant introducing
new technology in the form of the combined cycle scheme.
7.2 Supervision:
7.21   The Bank sent, on average, two supervision missions per year. Mission members, including a
local financial analyst, provided required support in helping TREC upgrade its financial management and
comply with Bank accounting and auditing requirements as well as to the completion of the physical
components in a timely manner. Mission members also provided support to the Ministry of Energy in the
policy sector dialogue. A Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA) was carried out in 2000. The panel
- 7 -



judged the Bank's supervision of this project as highly satisfactory overall as well as in each of the four
dimensions rated: (a) focus on development effectiveness; (b) supervision of fiduciary/safeguard
aspects; (c) adequacy of supervision inputs and processes; and (d) quality and realism of reporting. The
panel noted that Bank supervision was particu,arly effective in terms of frequency of field visits, task
team continuity and knowledge of the project, focus on development effectiveness, and consistency and
clarity of project monitoring, recommendations, advice given, timely follow-up, and reporting. The use of
a local consultant was judged as particularly innovative in view of efficiency gains in resource use,
access to an active presence on the ground in a key financial area, in a setting where Bank contacts are
otherwise quite limited.
7.22   Continuity in task team and mission composition fostered the kind of close working relationship
and spirit of cooperation that led to an effective sector dialogue. In the QSA assessment, it was noted
that the supervision team was able to maintain excellent rapport and was proactive and ready to
respond to issues as they arise, and that policy and institutional reforms remained high on the
supervision agenda. Bank is considered the key external advisor in this sector and has been credited
with high respect by client.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
7.31   For the reasons stated above, the Bank's performance was highly satisfactory in all respects.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
7.41   TREC laid the groundwork in preparing for the project site. It acquired sufficient land for the
plant and carried out geotechnical and seismic investigations as well as an assessment of water supply
availability to ensure that the size of the aquifer was adequate for plant needs without compromising
other local needs.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
7.51   The Government's commitment to the project-financed studies could have been stronger. MOE
could not complete the Energy Sector Development Study by the loan closing date, but it did endorse the
strategy that was formulated during the first phase of the Power Sector Restructuring Study.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
7.61   To carry out the Ghom plant component, a project implementation unit (PIU) was set up within
TREC. It was composed of highly qualified, seasoned professionals with many years' experience in plant
management and engineering. The PIU's performance was highly satisfactory not only because of
technical excellence, but also because PIU staff consistently sought and maintained a good rapport and
working relationship with their TREC colleagues as well as with their Bank counterparts.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
7.71   The performance of TREC, especially the PIU, was highly satisfactory. MOE's performance was
satisfactory, notwithstanding its less than full ownership of the studies component.
8. Lessons Learned
8.10   The success of the project's main component, the Ghom Combined Cycle Power Plant, and
dramatic improvements to TREC's financial management can be attributed to a well designed project
- 8 -



implemented by a PIU with a high level of project management capability together with continuity of the
PIU staff, continuity of Bank supervision staff, and the spirit of cooperation between the TREC and the
Bank. Invariably, shifts in management and staff on both the Borrower and Bank sides result in
setbacks, some greater than others. Were it not for the continuity factor in this case, the project outcome
would, in all likelihood, have been less successful.
8.20   Another contributing factor to the project's success, cited by the QSA panel as a best practice,
was the use of local expertise to upgrade the Borrower's financial management capability. The local
consultant provided invaluable advice, on an ongoing basis, and facilitated the timely review of annual
audit reports prepared in the local language (Farsi).
8.30   As in many Bank-supported projects, the software elements of this project received less attention
than its physical components. In general, policy and institutional aspects are often put on hold pending
endorsement by decision makers at higher levels, particularly where changeovers have occurred.
Tackling this problem should be regarded mainly as a country issue. As part of its intemal control and
quality assurance, the MNA Region should have a coherent and comprehensive supervision strategy that
would aim to ensure that policy and institutional objectives in all Bank-assisted projects in the Region's
portfolio are satisfied. If the Borrower is no longer committed or if it can be established that little, if any,
Borrower ownership ever existed in the first place, then the objectives of the technical assistance
component should be revisited, in a timely manner, within the context of the country dialogue and
ensuing Country Assistance Strategy.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
In the cover letter of the "Borrower Final Evaluation Report," Mr. Jannatian, the Managing Director and
Chairman of the Board of Directors, TREC, added the following comments:
... we would like here to extend our most appreciation and gratitude to all World Bank staff who actively
assisted us during these years and particularly mention the director of MNA and the mission manager who
has offered and provided valuable efforts and support for the success of the project."
