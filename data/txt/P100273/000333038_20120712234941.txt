                 IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Albania Avian Influenza
Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project (IDA-42060) under the
Global Program for Avian Influenza (GPAI) and Human Pandemic Preparedness and
Response.

The project was approved on June 27, 2006 and became effective on October 16, 2006. The
project was supported through an International Development Association (IDA) Grant for
US$5.00 million and a Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) Trust
Fund for US$0.8 million. At project closure US$3.87 million of the IDA Grant and US$0.60
million of the Japanese Trust Fund had been disbursed. The project closed on December 31,
2010, one year and a half behind schedule.

The report presents findings based on a review of the project’s implementation completion
and results report, program paper, legal documents, sector reports, and other relevant
material. In addition, an IEG mission to Albania in September 2011 held discussions in
Tirana with World Bank country staff, government officials and agencies, project staff, key
donors, non-government organizations, and academia and visited organizations such as the
Albanian Chamber of Veterinary Surgeons and the Tirana University Hospital Center. The
mission also made field visits to Korca and Vlora and held discussions with regional and sub-
regional government officials, agencies, and beneficiaries. The mission visited commercial
poultry houses in Vlora and Durres, the regional hospitals in Korca and Vlora, the slaughter
house in Korca, and also made a trip to the Kapshtica border crossing with Greece. The
contributions of all stakeholders, including World Bank staff in Tirana, are gratefully
acknowledged.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the Government
of Albania for comments, however no comments were received.

Summary
Albania had one of the fastest growing economies in Eastern Europe in the last decade and
has achieved middle income status today, graduating from IDA to IBRD in 2009. With
growth have come aspirations to join the European Union (EU). The requirements of EU
membership have contributed to political support for major institutional and policy reforms
and have also put pressure on the country to live up to EU standards, including when
responding to and preparing for emergencies. An emergency arose in 2006 in Albania when
there were two outbreaks of avian influenza among poultry on small farms. Outbreaks in
neighboring countries in 2005 had already made the Government of Albania aware of the
need to prepare for the possibility of an infection. Following the outbreaks, the Government
responded swiftly, followed EU procedures, and contained the outbreaks.

The avian influenza emergency provided an opportunity to the Government to demonstrate to
the international community, including the EU, the country’s ability to respond quickly and
effectively to a crisis situation. The Government also began efforts to improve surveillance
and detection measures, to prevent further outbreaks, and requested World Bank financing
for its efforts. The World Bank approved an emergency project for Albania in the same year
under the Global program for Avian Influenza Control (GPAI).

With an IDA Grant of US$5.0 million, the project development objective of the Avian
Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project was to
"strengthen the country's capacity to prevent the spread of avian influenza among poultry, to
prevent the transmission of avian influenza from birds to other animals and humans, and to
prepare for a potential pandemic of avian influenza transmissible between humans." The
project was restructured on October 15, 2009, and the PDO was revised to "minimize the
threat posed to humans by HPAI [Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza] infection and other
zoonoses and to prepare for, control, and respond to influenza pandemics and other
infectious disease emergencies in humans." This broadened the scope of the project from
focus on avian influenza alone to covering other diseases.

The original project development objective was in keeping with country and World Bank
priorities. While the outbreak in 2006 was adequately contained by Albanian authorities, the
veterinary and health systems in the country could have been challenged again with the
return of migratory water fowl in the coming years. More than half of the wild-bird species in
Albania are migratory and frequent wetlands that border farming communities. The outbreak
in Cuca village in 2006 for example, occurred because of contact between poultry and
migrant waterfowl around River Bistrica.

The original project design, had several strengths, and provided for international technical
organizations such as the WHO, FAO, and OIE to take the lead with the human and animal
health components with the World Bank providing funding support. However, the project
design was also very ambitious as it included support for several longer term construction
and capacity building activities that could be neither well prepared nor easily completed
within the quick-preparation period and short time-frame of an emergency operation.
                                               x


The restructuring was undertaken primarily because there were no further outbreaks of avian
influenza in Albania and fatigue had set in with avian influenza issues within the country.
Further, the Government also wanted to use one of the last IDA grants to the country, the
project, cost-effectively to further bring Albania’s capacity on food safety and veterinary
issues in line with EU standards. Utilization of the unused resources from the compensation
fund sub-component for the construction of a new animal health laboratory was, in the
Government’s opinion, one way to effectively utilize the resources.

While restructuring the project was a cost effective-strategy, it also broadened the scope from
avian influenza only to include other zoonotic diseases. With the broadening in scope and the
additional civil works that came with the construction of the animal health laboratory, the
project became even more ambitious than at the original design stage.

Covering other zoonotic diseases in an emergency operation also added an element of
incompatibility to an emergency project. Other zoonotic infections, such as brucellosis, while
a major health problem for Albania, do not spread from human-to-human as avian influenza
potentially could. Hence, dealing with them does not require the same scale of immediate
preparedness as demanded by a pandemic scenario. In addition, partly because the scope was
broadened, the priority given to preventing spread of avian influenza among poultry declined.
With very weak levels of biosecurity levels in poultry rearing systems in the country, this
reduced the relevance of the objective for preventing the pandemic in humans. Diminishing
the possibility of mutation of the virus by improving biosecurity levels was important for
diminishing the threat of human infections.

Overall, the project made a substantial contribution to increasing awareness about avian
influenza in the population, though the actual communication campaign that was conducted
with support from the project to some extent created panic amongst the population, and for
some time, negatively influenced the demand for poultry products. The project also
contributed to building capacity for disease surveillance and monitoring and diagnostic
capacity for animal and human diseases in the country. Albania no longer has to send
samples for tests to reference laboratories overseas. The project also helped build an
infectious disease Intensive Care Unit at the Tirana University Hospital Center and provided
training to key health staff in infection control, triage procedures and clinical management of
patients with pandemic flu and other diseases (e.g. tetanus, meningitis, sepsis, even HIV). It
also contributed to the drafting of the Veterinary law (passed in Parliament in September
2011) and a new EU compliant contingency plan for avian influenza preparedness was
prepared and approved. The experience with the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 demonstrated that
the project had substantially improved preparedness of the country.

However, partly because of the broadening of the project scope with the restructuring, the
project did little to improve the level of biosecurity which remains weak in both backyard
poultry systems and commercial establishments in Albania. Surveillance and monitoring
among wild birds, a major cause of spread of avian influenza, also was not improved.
Ultimately the animal health laboratory, one of the reasons for the restructuring, also was not
constructed because the required permit for its construction could not be obtained. There
were also some shortcomings in the efficiency of design and implementation of the project.
                                               xi


The project outcome, reflecting relevance, efficacy (the achievement of the objectives), and
efficiency, is rated moderately satisfactory.

The current recession, particularly the difficult financial conditions in Europe, have made
budget and resource positions tighter in Albania also. Availability of adequate resources for
operation and maintenance of improved laboratories and the ICU and training needed for
effective utilization of the diagnostic facilities in human and animal health is an issue. On a
positive note, the cooperation between international technical agencies and the World Bank,
particularly on communication and awareness raising activities that happened during the
project, is likely to ensure that were an emergency to arise, resources could be mobilized for
disseminating critical information quickly. Overall, the assessment rates the risk to
development outcome as significant.

Both Bank and Borrower performance are rated moderately satisfactory. M&E design,
implementation and utilization for project management was weak. Government
implementation agencies, particularly the veterinary authorities also showed weak
commitment in the early years that negatively influenced project performance. Inadequate
procurement capacity was also a major constraint. Given these early weaknesses the World
Bank should have also carefully assessed before agreeing to the proposal whether it was
realistic to expect the animal health laboratory to be completed in the short project time
period left after restructuring.

Building on the project experience this assessment identifies five main lessons:

   In designing an emergency intervention, it is important to distinguish between immediate
    response and longer-term capacity building activities. The latter are often included to
    build capacity to deal with future emergencies. However, such activities usually benefit
    from longer preparation and coordination with other sector interventions.
   Stronger Management oversight is needed to ensure that project M&E is actually utilized
    as a management tool for effective project implementation.
   Persistent occurrence of H5N1 infections in poultry around the world means that
    conditions for the mutation of the virus continue to prevail, including in Albania, where
    biosecurity levels remain weak on poultry farms. Greater effort is needed, both globally
    and in Albania, to improve surveillance in backyard poultry systems and wild-life to
    reduce risks.
   Early cooperation with UN agencies and international technical organizations can offer
    synergy and provide a basis for sustaining at least some programs on project closure.
   More effective ways of working with the media to communicate disease risks are needed
    to avoid panic and build public confidence.

1. Background and Project Context
Country Background
1.1     Albania, a small mountainous country in south-eastern Europe with a population of
about 3.1 million, was once the continent’s poorest country. Today it has achieved middle
income status, with one of the fastest rates of growth in Eastern Europe in the last decade
exceeding 6 percent per year (Figure 1). As a consequence, poverty declined dramatically
from about 25 percent of the population in 2002 to 12 percent in 2008, and social indicators
improved significantly. The global financial crisis slowed progress, but overall Albania
weathered the crisis well and, in contrast to most other European economies, avoided output
contraction (IMF 2011). However, the recent global economic downturn has put pressure on
budgets and negatively influenced remittances and trade, both of which have become
increasingly important for Albania’s growth.

European countries 1998-2010

1.2     Growth in the last decade was accompanied by structural transformation.
Construction and services expanded rapidly and now contribute more than 60 percent to GDP
(World Bank 2010a). The relative importance of agriculture in GDP declined from over 27
percent in 1998 to about 17 percent in 2010, although the sector remains critically important
for livelihoods in rural areas, where more than half of the population lives. The agriculture
sector has also seen major shifts in production patterns, with crops such as rice, cotton, and
wheat declining and livestock and associated forage crops, fruits, and vegetables increasing
in importance. The livestock sector now accounts for about half of total agricultural
production. Agro-processing (for example, olive oil production) has also increased
significantly in importance.

1.3     Despite high fertility rates, Albania’s population has not grown significantly over the
past 20 years, as natural growth has been offset by emigration. The country’s strong growth
                                                        2


in the past decade was supported by, among other factors, remittances from Albanians living
abroad.

1.4    The European Union (EU) is Albania’s main trading partner, accounting for 79
percent of the country’s exports and 64 percent of the country’s imports in 2009. Albania has
also been receiving financial assistance from the EU since 1991.In terms of both trade and
financial assistance, the current recession in Europe could have serious implications for
Albania’s future growth prospects.

1.5      With rapid growth in the last decade have come aspirations to join the EU. Albania
signed the EU Stabilization and Association Agreement in 2006, the first step towards EU
membership, and applied for EU membership in April 2009. While there have been
improvements on many fronts, the country still lags in meeting the requirements of the
acquis1 in several areas, including consumer health protection, food safety, and veterinary
and phyto-sanitary standards. However, the prospect of EU membership has motivated
institutional reform and political cooperation for undertaking difficult policy reforms (World
Bank 2008). It has also put pressure on the country to live up to EU standards on emergency
preparedness. One emergency arose in March 2006 in the form of avian influenza (AI).

Disease and Project Context
1.6     Between 2003 and 2011, the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus that causes avian
influenza affected 61 countries, including Albania, mainly in poultry although several
countries also reported human infections with the virus. Albania did not have human cases
but did report two outbreaks in poultry in early 2006, one in the village of Cuka, near
Saranda in south-western Albania, and the other in the village of Peze Helmes, just outside
Tirana in central Albania.

1.7     Avian influenza is usually restricted to birds. However, the disease can also infect
humans if they come in contact with infected birds. The H5N1 virus is deadly and has led to
high mortality in poultry, but also in infected humans. However, avian influenza virus types
generally do not readily replicate and transmit between humans and therefore the H5N1 virus
has so far largely ravaged the poultry industry. But avian influenza viruses, including H5N1,
could mutate to a form that is able to replicate and spread easily among humans. When this
happens a pandemic could occur, leading to massive death tolls in humans (as has happened
several times in the past century—see Annex B).2

  “The acquis is the body of common rights and obligations that is binding on all the Member States of the
European Union. It is constantly evolving and comprises: the content, principles, and political objectives of the
Treaties; legislation adopted pursuant to the Treaties and the case law of the Court of Justice; declarations and
resolutions adopted by the Union; instruments under the Common Foreign and Security Policy; instruments
under Justice and Home Affairs; international agreements concluded by the Community and those entered into
by the Member States among themselves within the sphere of the Union's activities. Adoption and
implementation of the acquis are the basis of the accession negotiations.?

  Influenza in humans can be caused by type A, B, or C viruses, with the first two causing most human
infections. Influenza outbreaks in humans occur annually because of a change in surface proteins in the viruses
and the severity of the disease varies from year to year. The viruses are mutating constantly, hence the need to
                                                        3


1.8     However, the actual timing of an avian influenza pandemic in humans depends on
when an avian influenza virus circulating in birds acquires the ability to transfer easily
among humans—but the risk remains.3 One of the biggest worries for the international
community and for countries such as Albania is that the conditions for the mutation of the
virus abound with birds living in close contact with humans in backyard poultry production
systems common throughout the developing world.4 Eighty-five percent of Albania’s nearly
six million poultry are reared in such systems where prevention and control measures are
difficult to enforce and risk of spread of infection is high. Increased globalization and trade,
and natural reservoirs for the virus in migratory birds, have increased the risk that avian
influenza caused by the H5N1 virus could spread rapidly from wild birds to poultry and from
infected poultry to humans. More than half of the 323 wild bird species in Albania are
reported to be migratory and frequent wetlands that border farming communities where a
large percentage of the backyard poultry farmers reside. The outbreak in Cuca likely
occurred because of the contact between poultry and migrant waterfowl around River
Bistrica.

1.9     Avian influenza outbreaks in neighboring countries in 2005 had already made the
Government of Albania aware of the need to prepare for the possibility of an infection. Even
before the first outbreak in the country in early 2006, the Government established a National
Influenza Pandemic Committee Task Force on October 28, 2005 under a Prime Ministerial
Order. The Government swiftly applied EU procedures to deal with the two outbreaks in
poultry.5 It also decided to mount immediate efforts to improve surveillance and detection
measures to contain any further outbreaks and requested World Bank financing for its efforts.
Improving preparedness was also important to demonstrate to the international community,
including the EU, that Albania was not only able to deal with emergencies quickly and
decisively, but was giving importance to preventing them in the future. The World Bank
approved an emergency project for Albania in June 2006 under the Global Program for
Avian Influenza Control (GPAI) (Box 1).


continuously update influenza vaccines. By contrast, influenza pandemics occur infrequently when viruses such
as those that cause avian influenza to which humans have not been exposed, mutate and acquire the ability to
transmit from person to person. On average, three pandemics per century have been documented since the 16th
century, occurring at intervals of 10-50 years. Details on the different kinds of avian influenza virus types and
their characteristics, including information on past pandemics are in Annex B.
3
  The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses continue to circulate in poultry and cause disease, and
remain a threat to human and animal health (FAO-OIE-WHO 2011a). During January to March 2011, 826
H5N1 outbreaks in poultry were reported from 12 countries around the world (ibid).
4
  In these poultry production systems farmers rear several animals, such as chickens, ducks, pigs, and cows, in
their backyards and in close proximity with human populations. The virus could change either through mutation
or re-assortment. Mutation occurs when a virus changes its genetic makeup allowing it to transmit from person
to person, whereas re-assortment occurs when two different viruses exchange genetic material. The re-
assortment could happen if animals that are susceptible to both human and avian influenza, such as pigs,
become concurrently infected with both kinds of influenza.
5
 For example, birds within three kilometers of the infection site were culled and a 10 kilometer quarantine zone
was established in accordance with EU procedures. Affected poultry owners whose birds were culled were
compensated under the 2004 Veterinary Law, Art. 62-69 at 100 percent of the market price of poultry, with
compensation provided within a week.
                                                                 4


Box 1: The Global Program for Avian Influenza Control (GPAI)
The threat of a severe global human pandemic arising from mutation of the H5N1 virus has caused great concern to
the international community. Billions of dollars have been pledged for efforts to control avian influenza. The Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the World Health
Organization (WHO) have committed to work together. The international technical agencies realize that both human
and animal health sectors have a stake in tackling pathogens that can threaten animal and human health and that
responding to these diseases requires a multi-sectoral and multi-institutional response. The World Bank agreed to
provide financial support to the effort being undertaken through these international organizations and has helped
more than 50 countries.
The Bank has two main mechanisms to support client countries in this area: the Global Program for Avian Influenza
(GPAI) and the multi-donor Avian and Human Influenza Facility (AHIF). The Bank's Board of Executive
Directors endorsed the GPAI in January 2006 and extended it in June 2009. The AHI Facility was also created in
2006 to assist developing countries in meeting financing gaps in their integrated country programs to minimize the
risk and socioeconomic impact of avian and possible human pandemic influenza. In many cases, the facility co-
finances projects under GPAI.
GPAI is a global horizontal Adaptable Program Loan (APL) that allows for the use of up to US$ 1 billion (an
increase from the original amount of US$500 million) under which individual countries can obtain separate
loans/credits/grants (depending on country case) to finance their own national projects. The overall program
development objective for the GPAI is "to minimize the threat posed to humans by HPAI infection and other
zoonoses and to prepare for, control, and respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in
humans." (World Bank 2005, p. 16).

The Albania project was the fifth operation to be approved under the GPAI Program. The GPAI draws on an
integrated approach developed in conjunction with FAO, OIE, and WHO. Countries can access funding to
strengthen their veterinary and health services to deal with avian influenza outbreaks among animals, minimize the
threat to people, and prepare for and respond to any potential human influenza pandemic. GPAI operations are
processed using emergency procedures, which allow quick preparation and approval. A country qualifies for support
for an emergency project under the Program when it demonstrates its commitment and readiness to implement early
detection and rapid response measures appropriate to the specific country conditions. Different criteria were
established for country participation on the basis of the gravity of avian influenza situation in the country. Albania
was considered an “imminent risk case? with the confirmation of the first case of infection in poultry in March 2006.
Note: OIE is an independent intergovernmental organization founded in 1924 with 178 members. Its mandate is to improve
animal health worldwide. OIE’s headquarters are in Paris and there are 11 regional offices. In 2004 OIE member countries
approved the creation of a single list of diseases to be notified to OIE. First outbreaks of all listed diseases should be officially
notified to OIE within 24 hours.

Potential Threats from Avian Influenza

1.10 This report assesses the World Bank supported Avian Influenza Control and Human
Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project (2006-10, $4.7 million actual). Building on
the disease context discussed above the potential threats from avian influenza can be
categorized as follows:

         An outbreak among poultry, with economic cost for animal production.
         Humans come into contact with infected animals and develop influenza, but not of a
          form that could be easily transmitted between humans. This would lead to a modest
          number of human influenza cases and possibly deaths.
                                                        5


          A strain of avian influenza transmissible between humans develops within Albania
           and leads to an influenza epidemic or pandemic if not contained.
          A strain transmissible between humans develops elsewhere, causing a pandemic that
           spreads to Albania.

1.11 Poultry outbreaks and cases of transmission from poultry to humans have already
happened in several countries. However, Albania has only had outbreaks among poultry so
far. A strain of avian influenza that is transmissible between humans has not happened
recently anywhere in the world but the risk remains, both within countries and as transmitted
from other countries.

2. Project Objectives, Design, and their Relevance
Objectives
2.1     According to both the financing agreement and the Technical Annex6 the project
development objective (PDO) was to "strengthen the country's capacity to prevent the spread
of avian influenza among poultry, to prevent the transmission of avian influenza from birds
to other animals and humans, and to prepare for a potential pandemic of avian influenza
transmissible between humans" (World Bank 2006b, p ii).

2.2     The project was restructured on October 15, 2009, and the PDO was revised to
"minimize the threat posed to humans by HPAI [Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza]
infection and other zoonoses7and to prepare for, control, and respond to influenza pandemics
and other infectious disease emergencies in humans." With the restructuring the project's
scope broadened to include other zoonotic diseases of concern, such as brucellosis and
rabies.

2.3     Several reasons were given for the restructuring: (i) There were no further avian
influenza outbreaks in poultry during the project's first two years and no human infections;
the restructuring would bring the PDO in line with the goals of the GPAI (Box 1); (ii) In
2009 there was a declaration of pandemic level 6 by the World Health Organization (WHO)8
for the H1N1 virus and the restructuring would allow the country to use project resources to
respond to that pandemic; (iii) Resources needed to be adjusted for the construction of the
Animal Health Laboratory. Fatigue with avian influenza had also set in within the country
and since diseases such as brucellosis, were endemic in the country, broadening the PDO to
cover these zoonotic diseases was also expected to enable the Government to devote
resources from one of the last IDA grants to Albania for an issue of importance for the EU
accession process.9 World Bank documents (see, for example,World Bank 2008) reveal that
6
 In accordance with the relevant Operational Policy at that time –OP and BP 8.50—on Emergency Recovery
Assistance, there is a Technical Annex for the project, rather than a project appraisal document.
7
  Zoonoses are infectious diseases in animals that can be transmitted to people. The natural reservoir for the
infectious pathogen is the animal. Rabies and anthrax are examples of zoonoses.
8
    See Annex B for the WHO epidemic phase definitions.
9
    Albania graduated to IBRD status in FY09.
                                                      6


meeting EU standards was a concern for Albania; IEG mission interviews with government
officials confirmed that through the restructuring, the project was expected to help bring
capacity on food safety and veterinary issues in line with EU standards.

Relevance of the Objectives
ORIGINAL OBJECTIVES

2.4     The original PDO was in keeping with country priorities and the goal in the 2010
Country Partnership Strategy of decreasing the country’s vulnerability to natural and man-
made disasters. It was a Government initiative to mount a rapid response to improve
surveillance and detection for which it requested support from the Bank. The outbreak in
2006 had been contained, but the veterinary and health systems in the country could have
been challenged again with the return of migratory water fowl in the coming years. The
project was also likely to help Albania strengthen its veterinary systems to bring it in line
with the EU acquis.

2.5    The emphasis on preventing the spread of avian influenza among poultry made the
PDO particularly relevant to the country conditions in Albania, where the avian influenza
outbreak had occurred in poultry that are reared largely in backyard systems where risk of
spread of infection is high. The possibility of infection through infected wild-birds was also
high because of Albania’s proximity to major flyways for migratory birds—the East Africa
West Asia flyway and the Central Asia flyway. Preventing spread of avian influenza amongst
poultry was critical to the broader overall goal of eventually containing spread of avian
influenza from animals to humans and diminishing the global threat of a pandemic. The
GPAI Program document notes that there was consensus among the three international
agencies—WHO, FAO, and OIE—on the need to contain HPAI at its source.

2.6     The original PDOs were responsive to all four disease scenarios—that is, to prevent
outbreak of avian influenza in poultry and the possibility of human infections through contact
with infected animals, and building capacity to respond to an influenza pandemic between
humans emerging within Albania or spreading to Albania from other countries. Relevance of
the original objective is rated high.

REVISED OBJECTIVES

2.7     The restructuring brought the PDO in line with that of the GPAI Program document
(Box 1). Since there were no further outbreaks in poultry and human infections with avian
influenza did not actually happen in Albania, broadening of the PDO may have been critical
to sustain interest more generally for diagnosis and prevention of zoonoses, including avian
influenza. The broadening of the PDO was also likely to help the country build capacity and
make modifications and adjustments in the overall animal health program in line with EU
requirements.10 Zoonoses, such as brucellosis, are a major public health problem in Albania


10
  The EU accession process worked as a powerful incentive to motivate the government to speed up the
improvement and modernization of the veterinary service structure in compliance with international standards
(OIE 2008).
                                                          7


(World Bank 2007).11 The revised objectives were hence in keeping with Government
priorities for EU membership. Supporting Albania’s EU agenda was a priority of the Bank’s
2010 Partnership Strategy as well.

2.8     However, it is not clear why the emphasis on controlling the spread of avian influenza
among poultry was no more explicitly part of the revised PDO as it was for the original one.
For preventing the pandemic in humans it is essential to control it in poultry so that
conditions for the mutation of the virus are minimized. The GPAI program document had
clearly noted the importance of preventing the spread of the disease in poultry.
         “the risk that a pandemic virus will emerge……..will persist as long as the H5N1 virus continues to
         circulated in animals.? Page 3 World Bank 2005

2.9      On balance, relevance of the revised PDO is assessed as substantial.

Design
2.10 The project was processed as an emergency investment operation using procedures
under Operational Policy (OP) 8.50 on Emergency Recovery Assistance (Box 1). The IDA
Grant was for US$5.0 million, with co-financing of US$0.8 million from a Japanese Policy
and Human Resource Development (PHRD) grant to assist with consultant services and
training to support project implementation. The Government contribution was to be for
US$0.3 million for a total appraisal project cost of US$6.1 million.

2.11     Components. The project had four components:

2.12 Public Awareness and Information Campaign (Original estimate US$0.5 million;
after restructuring US$0.5 million; Actual US$0.1 million): to help develop and implement a
communication plan to inform the public about the disease's threat, and how its risk of
transmission and spread could be minimized. There were two sub-components:

     Risk Communication, to identify mechanisms for communication on the avian influenza
      situation, and establishing and maintaining productive working relationship with the
      media in propagating essential and consistent information on the disease.
     Communication for Behavior Change, to develop and disseminate key messages and
      materials for different audiences, particularly key high-risk groups, such as farmers and
      children in wetland areas where the probability of exposure was high.

2.13 After restructuring, the component was to address the remaining knowledge gaps
within the population concerning influenza-like diseases, other zoonoses and the H1N1
pandemic

11
  “The uncontrolled movement of animals, the non-application of sanitary and quarantine rules as well as the
low level of cultural and technical education of farmers, together with a limited budget for implementing an
eradication strategy (total screening, total elimination of positive heads), led to an expansion of brucellosis
across the country. .. This infection currently affects the entire territory of the country, reaching a prevalence of
10 percent in several districts such as Saranda and Gjirokaster. The number of persons affected by brucellosis is
increasing, particularly in rural areas? (World Bank 2007).
                                               8


2.14 Animal Health (Original estimate US$3.7 million; after restructuring US$3.2
million; Actual US$1.3 million): to support a national program to develop and implement
short and long-term avian influenza prevention, containment, control, and eradication
activities in animals. There were three sub-components:

   Enhancing Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Prevention and Preparedness Capacity, to
    strengthen the national policy and regulatory environment for veterinary service and
    inspection, and to improve prevention and control planning. To also support introduction
    of tools and mechanisms for improvement of bio-safety practices in poultry production.
   Strengthening Disease Control Capacities and Improving Surveillance Diagnostic
    Capacities, and Applied Research, to strengthen veterinary epidemiological surveillance
    through the creation of a National Veterinary Epidemiological Unit (NVEU). To also
    support improvement in national diagnostic capacities and bio-safety protocols at the
    Institute of Veterinary Research (IVR), and animal disease information systems.
   Strengthening Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Control Programs and Outbreak
    Containment Programs, to target virus eradication at source through culling and disposal
    of infected and at-risk poultry, and control of bird movement. This was to be undertaken
    with the assistance of two properly equipped mobile sub-units from the NVEU. It also
    included a Compensation Fund of US$2.0 million, to support the government in
    compensating farmers for livestock culls.

2.15 After restructuring, the component was to finance the construction of a new (as
opposed to reconstruction of the existing) Animal Health laboratory foreseen at project
approval. The estimated cost of the new Animal Health laboratory was about US$1.9 million
compared to about US$0.3 million for the originally planned reconstruction. About US$1
million was to come from reallocation of the Compensation Fund (US$ 2.0 million) and the
emergency eligible imported goods finance (US$0.3 million) under the health component
(see bullet three under 3 below) available because of absence of disease in the first two years.
The Government was to contribute additional financing of about US$0.7 million. The rest of
the resources released from the Compensation fund were redirected towards additional
human health component activities.

2.16 Human Health (Original estimate US$1.6 million; after restructuring US$2.7
million; Actual US$2.7 million): to support a national program to develop and implement
short and medium-term prevention of an outbreak of avian influenza among humans. It also
had three sub-components:

   Enhancing Coordination and Program Planning,to strengthen intra-sector command and
    sector coordination mechanisms, supporting regular revisions, and update of the MOH
    contingency plan and finance the development of a detailed implementation plan for
    “social distancing? measures in the case of an epidemic. To also support preparation of a
    training program and regular simulation exercises.
   Strengthening the National Public Health Surveillance System, to increase the capacity
    of the National Influenza Laboratory through the provision of equipment, kits and
    reagents, and the training/retraining of laboratory staff; and strengthening the capacity of
    the Institute of Public Health and regional epidemiological investigation and response
    teams.
                                                     9


    Strengthening Health Care Response Capacity, to strengthen the capacity of medical
     services to isolate and treat patients with severe communicable diseases, support the
     purchase and distribution of anti-viral drugs and develop effective guidelines for their
     use, and expand immunization against seasonal flu for staff and population at risk. In case
     of a declared influenza pandemic, this component was to also finance emergency imports
     identified as necessary under a well-defined preparedness and response program to be
     prepared as part of project implementation.

2.17 After restructuring, the component was to support the revisions of the National
Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan according to WHO recommendations, take the needed
time to capitalize on completed and on-going activities, in particular to raise preparedness in
the regions for diagnosis, referrals, and management of outbreak and pandemic, improve
triage and intra-hospital procedures for infection control specifically for regional hospitals
and enhance knowledge of primary health care workers. About US$1.0 million was
earmarked for all additional activities and for activities that go beyond the original cost
estimates.

2.18 Avian Influenza Task Force12(Original estimate US$0.3 million; after
restructuring US$0.4 million; Actual US$0.3 million): to support the inter-ministerial and
inter-sectoral Task Force in implementation of the Government's avian influenza response
strategy (including the first three components). It had two sub-components to strengthen the
Task Force:

         Permanent Secretariat, with full-time staff to manage the project. .
         Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), to support M&E capacities and activities at all
         administrative levels, and to develop an action plan for M&E with baseline studies,
         ongoing participatory M&E and a final project evaluation.

2.19 After restructuring, the component did not change except for expanding M&E to
include pandemic preparedness and response.

2.20 Implementation Arrangements. The project was implemented nation-wide. The
Avian Influenza Task Force along with the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Consumer
Protection (MAFCP) and the Ministry of Health (MOH), were the main implementation
agencies, with overall responsibility for coordinating institutional and implementation
arrangements being vested in the Task Force. Since the Deputy Minister of Agriculture was
the chair of the Task Force, among the two agencies, MAFCP’s responsibility was primary.
Two full time coordinators (one for animal and the other for human health) reported to the
Task Force.




12
  The Task Force was established by an order of the Prime Minister on October 28, 2005 before the project was
approved and included the ministries of Agriculture (chair), Health, Interior, Education, Environment and
Finance.

Relevance of Design
RELEVANCE OF DESIGN TO THE ORIGINAL OBJECTIVES

2.21 Similar to avian influenza projects in other countries the Albania project was
designed as an emergency operation under the GPAI Program. Also in keeping with the
overall Program, it had separate animal and human health components. The causal
framework emphasized the strengthening of institutional capacity, including capacity in
surveillance, and diagnostic and response systems as a means of increasing the country’s
preparedness for avian influenza and was relevant to the PDO. There is concern, however, as
to why the project provided for a compensation fund when a government compensation
system for farmers for loss of poultry and other animals was already in place.

2.22 Further, the broad range of emergency and non-emergency activities that were
included as a part of the project provided for a very ambitious design for an emergency
project, with internal tensions and trade-offs between short- and long-term needs and the time
needed to prepare for them (Box 2). Perhaps, being part of a horizontal APL contributed to
this. It was decided at the outset that activities under it would be processed as an emergency
operation, and hence everything whether it was emergency or not was lumped together.13

2.23    Overall, relevance of design to the original objectives is assessed as substantial.




13
  The GPAI document noted: “Since this Program is designed to provide emergency finance to participating
countries to contain an outbreak of avian flu through early detection and rapid response measures, the
operations under the Program would be processed under the Banks’ emergency policy, OP/BP 8.50. The
Program would treat specific emergency response projects in each country as “phases? of a horizontal APL….?
(World Bank 2005 .p.13).

    audiences, particularly key high-risk groups, such as farmers and children in wetland areas where
    probability of exposure was high. Managing a communications campaign to inform the general
    public about the status of avian influenza in the country and actions being taken by the
    government;

   Supporting the purchase and distribution of medicines-- anti-viral drugs and vaccines and
    expanding immunization against seasonal flu for staff and population at risk.
   Virus eradication at the source through culling and disposal of infected and at-risk poultry,

   Strengthening the national policy and regulatory environment for veterinary service and
    inspection;
   Strengthening veterinary epidemiological surveillance through the creation of a National
    Veterinary Epidemiological Unit (NVEU) which needed to be integrated with the epidemiology

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN TO THE REVISED OBJECTIVES

2.24 The revised objectives brought about two major changes in design—they broadened
the scope of the project to cover other zoonoses and increased the emphasis on the capacity
building aspects. These changes created several shortcomings.

2.25 First, minimizing the threat to humans from influenza pandemics remained a project
objective but the changes led to neglect of a critical aspect of the avian influenza control
strategy that had been emphasized by the three technical organizations—WHO, FAO and
OIE—containment at source which put emphasis on reducing
          “the virus load and circulation in poultry and spread to unaffected areas or countries, and therefore
         also decrease the risk of human infections or the development of a human pandemic virus.? FAO
         2007b.
                                              12


2.26 This change affected the implementation of activities. For example, before the
restructuring, surveys were to be undertaken in the country to understand and develop the
most effective approach for improving biosecurity in the poultry industry. During supervision
missions the World Bank was asked to provide examples of terms of reference for
organizations that could be hired to conduct such surveys and output from similar work in
other countries as the basis for this work in Albania. However, with the emphasis on other
diseases as well, the focus changed and the survey and the study on biosecurity were
canceled. Discussions with government officials and Bank staff reveal that this de-emphasis
came about partly because the objective no longer explicitly included prevention of spread of
avian influenza among poultry and partly because of the diversion that came with the HINI
pandemic.

2.27 Second, the design after restructuring gave even greater emphasis to longer-term
capacity building and construction activities. The building of the Animal Health laboratory is
an example.

2.28 Finally, there were two parts to the revised objective as related to other zoonoses. The
first, to minimize threat to humans and the second part, to prepare for, control and respond
to other infectious disease emergencies in humans. Project activities essentially covered the
second part and were related to improving communication, increasing awareness,
surveillance, upgrade of laboratory facilities to undertake tests and creation of an infectious
disease ICU. There is a whole area of animal product management activities, including for
example, dealing with conditions of slaughter houses and processing of milk products, a
major source of infection from diseases such as brucellosis, which are essential to achieving
success on minimizing the threat to humans. These were not included as activities under the
revised objectives, which comprised a major omission in the results framework of the
restructured project. That said, the revised project objectives were quite ambitious and the
size of the restructured loan could not possibly do justice to it. Hence, there was some
disconnect between the revised and expanded PDO and the activities supported.

2.29   On balance, relevance of design to the revised objectives is assessed as modest.

3. Implementation
3.1     The project was approved on June 27, 2006 and became effective on October 16 of
the same year. It was formally restructured in October 2009 and closed on December 31,
2010, a year and a half behind schedule. Actual project cost was US$4.7 million of which
the IDA Grant was US$3.9 million and the PHRD grant was US$0.6 million. The Borrower
contribution was US$0.3 million. About US$1.6 million was canceled, as the building permit
for the Animal Health laboratory was not issued and hence the construction was not carried
out and related furniture was not purchased.

Implementation Experience
3.2     Disbursement was very slow to begin with. As of November 30, 2007, when half the
project lifetime had elapsed, about 17 percent of IDA and about 11 percent of the Japanese
grant had been disbursed. The delay in the first year was primarily because of the limited
                                              13


procurement management capacity. Given the urgency of launching the emergency project,
MAFCP and the Bank had agreed to use the project management unit of the ongoing Water
Resource Management Project for handling procurement issues until a procurement specialist
was hired. However, the avian influenza project had far too many small contracts to be
processed in a short time, overwhelming the staff of the Water Project.

3.3      There was also limited buy-in of project activities in the initial period by the
veterinary directorate. In fact, supervision reports note the poor involvement of and
ownership by the Chief Veterinary Officer as a major factor negatively affecting project
implementation. While the National Veterinary Epidemiological Unit was established to
enhance disease monitoring, surveillance, and control, it lacked a clear work plan and vision.
Supervision missions report that until December 2007, the Unit had little to show for its
utilization and relevance. Its newly hired staff were paid for by the project with the
understanding that as of January 1, 2008 they would be absorbed by MAFCP. However, the
employment status of the Unit’s staff remained an unresolved issue for a long time,
negatively influencing morale and work in the unit.

3.4     As designed the project was to invest in the improvement of isolation rooms in 15
hospitals, including three in Tirana, to receive suspected avian influenza patients. However,
infection control procedures in the regional hospitals were found to be weak during the WHO
assessment of existing facilities. The Ministry of Health then opted to have one central
modern facility, to serve as a referral hospital for avian influenza patients for the whole
country, and agreed to refurbish the Intensive Care Unit at the Tirana University Hospital
Center to WHO standards for patient management. Regional hospitals were to undergo a
review of triage practices with emphasis on implementing WHO standards for control of
infections in health facilities.

3.5     Implementation of the public awareness and information campaign component
progressed well in the early period partly, because of support provided by UN agencies and
USAID. Ultimately the component spent only a fifth of what was planned. A
communications working group comprised of representatives of the Institute of Public
Health, the Institute of Food Safety and Veterinary (IFSV), the Albanian Council of
Agribusiness (KASH), Task Force Secretariat, WHO, United States Agency for International
Development (USAID), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Ministry of
Environment, and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) was established to work on
a strategic communication plan for the prevention of avian influenza. However, the
communication campaign that was implemented with support from the project created panic
amongst the population. UNICEF-conducted Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP)
surveys reported a decline in consumption of poultry meat.

3.6    Towards the end of 2007 the implementation of activities for the awareness-raising
component slowed partly because it was difficult to sustain interest in avian influenza when
there were no new outbreaks. In 2009, the focus of the public awareness component shifted
to HINI, with the Ministry of Health playing a leading role in the communication strategy.

3.7     As early as the July 2007 supervision mission, about 9 months after project
effectiveness, MAFCP expressed its interest in broadening the project scope. However,
                                                         14


because the animal husbandry component was not progressing well, the Bank postponed
considering this request until the mid-term review. With some improvement in
implementation by mid-term, the Bank mission agreed to the restructuring and endorsed the
construction of a new animal health laboratory for the IFSV.14 However, the mission also
noted that the construction of the new facility was contingent upon clarification and
verification of the ownership status of the premises and the issue of a building permit calling
for extension of the project closing date. MAFCP proposed to use its own reserves (which
amounted to approximately US$850,000) with the balance being contributed by the project
through the partial utilization of the compensation fund.

3.8    After the restructuring in October 2009, and particularly after June 2010, the main
focus of the Task Force Secretariat was on trying to obtain the building permit for the Animal
Health Laboratory. This, however, could not be obtained from the Tirana Municipality
Committee. As a result, even though the property on which the laboratory was to be built had
been registered with the Immovable Property Registration Office, the design had been
completed, an environmental impact assessment and update of the Environment Management
Plan had been done, and the tender of the civil works had been launched, the construction
could not be completed.15

3.9    When the H1N1 pandemic occurred in Albania in the fall and winter of 2009 the
Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Finance requested additional financing of US$3
million for purchase of H1N1 vaccines as well as some additional medical equipment for
dealing with pandemic preparedness. The Bank team responded promptly and the
negotiation package was ready on January 11, 2010. However, the pandemic had peaked by
then. Hence the Government decided not to purchase additional doses of pandemic vaccine
and negotiations for additional financing were cancelled.

Safeguards
3.10 The project was assigned an Environment category B since it supported investments
to deal with poultry carcass disposal, laboratories, and hospitals. The project Operational
Manual was to include an Environmental Assessment and an Environmental Management

14
   The merger of the Institute of Veterinary Research (IVR) with the Institute of Food Research resulted in the
creation of a new organization the Institute of Food Safety and Veterinary (IFSV) in 2006 after the project
started. An OIE evaluation (2008) also pointed to the limited space available in IFSV for undertaking work to
international standards. The evaluation notes that the “space available for all laboratory activities, especially for
the extended food safety activities is limited. In addition, office space has been included within the laboratory
units at a great risk to biosecurity and to the workers’ health.?
15
  The ICR notes that on May 19, 2010, the client informed the Bank that the civil works had commenced. The
Bank in its response of June 7, 2010 asked that the construction be stopped until such time that the building
permit had been obtained to ensure that the Project remained consistent with national laws and regulations.
According to the task team the construction had started with the contractor using his own resources expecting
the permit to come through.
                                               15


Plan. Given the emergency nature of the project, the requirement for completing the EA and
EMP during project preparation was waived. The Assessment and the Management Plan
were to address the procedures for culling and disposal of poultry, the handling of medical
waste generated by laboratories and health care facilities, and civil works for rehabilitation of
laboratories and hospitals. They were completed in July 2006, before project effectiveness.

3.11 Overall safeguard compliance was satisfactory. The prevention-focused activities for
intensive care, infection control, and hospital-waste management are likely to have a positive
environmental impact. A legal review to ensure that the Animal Health Laboratory was to be
constructed on land owned by MAFCP and had been registered by the Immovable Property
Registration Office was also carried out. The Government also undertook the additional
Environmental Assessment for the laboratory and updated the Environmental Management
Plan.

Fiduciary
3.12 The challenges in getting adequate support on procurement that led to delay in
implementation have been mentioned earlier. The large number of small contracts and
incorporation of civil works in an emergency project created a challenge. The Bank agreed to
the use of procurement staff from another project, but that was not adequate. Government
officials told the IEG mission that the Bank’s inflexibility in requiring procurement
specialists to have past experience with the Bank or international agencies was partly
responsible for the delay. According to them, the Bank could have agreed to train eligible
candidates even if they did not have prior Bank or international agency experience, and this
would also have helped build capacity in the country.

3.13 Procurement post-reviews found that overall the procurement function was
discharged satisfactorily, although there were some unjustified delays. There were also some
problems related to a consultant working without a contract for some time. In December
2010 financial management arrangements, including internal controls, project accounting,
and flow-of-funds and auditing arrangements were reviewed to assess continued adequacy of
systems and controls and were found adequate for project completion. The previous mission
had recommended strengthening monitoring which was carried out. Though there were some
delays in some project audit reports, no major issues were reported to have been identified in
the Interim Financial Reports submitted to the Bank on a quarterly basis.

4. Achievement of the Objectives
4.1     The original and restructured project each had three parts to the development
objectives, two of which were the same – preventing the spread of avian influenza from birds
to other animals and/or to humans and preparing for a pandemic of avian influenza
transmissible between humans. The objective of strengthening the capacity to prevent the
spread of avian influenza among poultry was only in the original project, while the objective
to minimize the threat posed to humans by other zoonoses was only in the restructured
project. This chapter assesses the achievement of each of the four objectives, summarized in
Table 1.

a.The revised objective included preventing transmission of avian influenza from birds to humans only,
otherwise the same.

Strengthen the country's capacity to prevent the spread of avian influenza
among poultry
4.2    This report looks at project contribution in the following areas to assess whether it
helped strengthen the country’s capacity to prevent the spread of avian influenza among
poultry.

       Awareness in the country about the disease;
       Biosecurity in commercial poultry establishments and backyard systems to prevent
        spread of AI;
       Surveillance and monitoring of avian influenza in poultry and wild birds;
       Compensation system to ensure that farmers have the incentive to report incidence
        of avian influenza in their poultry;
       Response system to ensure that measures such as culling can be taken in time to
        prevent infection from spreading among poultry if it does occur in some areas.

4.3      Awareness. The project, along with the activities supported through the UN agencies
and USAID, made a substantial contribution to increasing awareness about avian influenza in
the country. It supported a widespread public awareness and information campaign that
involved production of a large amount of communication material (12,000 printed leaflets,
posters, guides and television messages). Training sessions were held in Tirana and other
cities for health care workers, teachers, school directors and deputy directors, and education
inspectors on symptoms, prevention, and transmission. The Albanian Council of
Agribusiness (KASH), through its extended network of farmer associations and regional
branches, also supported awareness-raising among farmers for avian influenza signs and
prevention.

4.4    KAP Surveys by UNICEF show an increase in safe handling practices for poultry and
poultry meat including: washing hands after touching poultry or poultry products (16.4
percent in 2006 increased to 63.8 percent in 2009); cooking poultry products well (21.7
percent to 59 percent); awareness about avoiding contact with dead poultry and wild birds
                                                       17


(13.4 percent to 50.2 percent) (UNICEF 2009). The KAP surveys also reported that a large
number of respondents had seen and read leaflets and brochures and understood them. A
significant increase in the proportion of the population who knew what kinds of signs to
expect for an avian influenza infection in the population was also noted. However, the KAP
survey in 2006 also showed that nearly 28 percent of the population reported having reduced
their consumption of poultry meat as a result of the information campaign and nearly 34
percent had stopped consuming poultry meat. Hence, the need to carry out a public
information campaign on diseases such as avian influenza without causing panic that can
damage the poultry industry is an important lesson from the project experience.

4.5     Biosecurity. Improving the level of biosecurity is critical to preventing the spread of
avian influenza among poultry (Box 3). The IEG mission’s discussions with stakeholders in
the country however, revealed that the project has created general awareness about the
importance of good biosecurity in rearing poultry. Yet, the project did not do much in this
area. A planned survey on biosecurity issues was canceled. Government officials confirmed
that there are no specific laws on biosecurity in the country as yet. The new veterinary law, to
the drafting of which the project contributed, was passed in the Parliament in September
2011 and is expected to initiate changes in this area.

4.6     Surveillance and monitoring. The project started the process of enumeration of
poultry, but it has since stalled. Today the few epidemiologists that now remain in the
National Veterinary Epidemiological Unit are focused on monitoring and reporting incidents
of all animal diseases, including avian influenza. The project could not make any significant
contribution in increasing collaboration with the Ministry of Environment in monitoring of
wild birds.16




16
  Currently the main source of information on unusual death rates among wild animals (including birds) is
informal –feedback from hunters, hunter’s associations, and forestry and fishing service experts. However, the
IEG mission’s discussions with stakeholders at various levels revealed that in Albania there is a culture of
notifying anything unusual to the authorities, partly a spinoff from the awareness campaign and partly because
farmers are aware that they themselves will be negatively affected by disease. Hence, if an avian influenza
outbreak were to begin in commercial establishments or in backyard poultry because of contact with infected
wild birds close to cities, as happened in 2006, it is very likely that the veterinary department will know quite
soon. However, were the infection to occur in the remote hilly areas of Albania, it would be a while before the
veterinary department would find out. There is however, one factor that could complicate the whole reporting
process: a large part of the population in the rural areas has access to veterinarians who do not have graduate
level degrees and interviews suggest that these veterinarians may have limited capacity to identify avian
influenza cases in poultry, particularly when clinical symptoms for avian influenza are very similar to
Newcastle disease that is endemic in the country. Farmers may consider their responsibility done if they report
the existence of an outbreak to these veterinarians.

Box 3: Biosecurity and its enforcement in poultry farms/commercial establishments in
Albania
Biosecurity refers to measures taken to prevent incursion and spread of disease. It includes hygiene
and management measures to minimize the risk of introducing pathogens on farms or poultry
establishments (“bio-exclusion?) and measures to minimize the risk of transmission of infection to
other farms in case a disease outbreak occurs (“bio-containment?). These two sets of measures
would require, among other things, appropriate construction of poultry houses to prevent entry of
wild birds and rodents, proper ventilation, limiting entry of non-essential visitors, use of appropriate
disinfectants in foot and wheel dips, hand hygiene, aerial and litter disinfection, and protective
clothing. These measures are often supplemented with vaccination.
Biosecurity levels are very weak in backyard poultry systems in Albania where about 85 percent of
birds are reared. However, even in commercial poultry houses the level to which sound management
practices are adopted is variable. The IEG mission visited three large commercial egg-producing
poultry establishments, one in Vlora district and two in Durres, and found variable enforcement of
biosecurity. Only one of the three establishments was found to be practicing biosecurity norms that
would be in keeping with international standards. While arrangements for wheel and foot dips in
disinfectants were available in all three, all of which also had a vet on site, the level of cleanliness
was not high in two of them and there were limited restrictions on entry and no requirements for
wearing protective gear in entering buildings where the birds were kept.
For large farms, taking appropriate biosecurity measures is in their commercial interests, although high
costs that come with good prevention measures can discourage compliance. For village level producers,
concerns about biosecurity are not related to production and profit given that birds often die and this is
accepted as the norm in low-input systems. There is a public good element in bio-containment; large
producers have little incentive to limit an outbreak from spreading to others once infection occurs in a
poultry establishment.
In the interest of food safety and disease control, governments have laws to enforce specific standards
of biosecurity. In Albania as yet there is no specific government law on biosecurity and no specific
requirements are enforced. Biosecurity by-laws have still to be drafted as part of the National Strategy
for Development and Integration (2007-2013), which is a comprehensive and ambitious plan
providing for the approximation of national legislation to the EU accession requirements.

4.7    Compensation system. A compensation system to farmers for loss of poultry and
other animals was in place before the project and remains in place now. During the 2006
outbreak affected poultry owners whose birds were culled were compensated within a week
under the 2004 Veterinary Law, Articles 62-69 at 100 percent of the market price. The
compensation fund established under the project was not used because there was no further
outbreak in poultry. There is provision for compensation and contingency funding under the
national budget and this provides an incentive for poultry and livestock owners to report sick
and dead animals to veterinarians. The Ministry of Finance is able to provide timely
compensation within 10 days. The new veterinary law that was passed in Parliament in
September 2011 lays down very clear rules for compensation. However, the resources set
aside by the Government can only cover a limited number of cases. The compensation
arrangements would not be sufficient to cover a widespread outbreak.
                                                       19


4.8     Response system. The project provided only a limited number of vehicles and
transport remains one of the biggest constraints for the veterinary service to respond in time
if outbreaks of disease occur, particularly in remote areas and in wildlife. IEG mission
discussions with stakeholders at the regional level revealed that veterinary officials find it
difficult to travel to distant villages for regular inspections because they have either no means
of transport or a very limited budget for reimbursement of travel expenditures. The OIE
evaluation of the Performance of Veterinary Services for Albania had similar findings and
noted that transport facilities are totally insufficient for early warning and emergency
response.17

4.9    Overall the project made a modest contribution to the achievement of the objective to
prevent transmission among poultry.

Prevent the transmission of Avian Influenza from birds to other animals
and to humans
4.10 There were no outbreaks and therefore to assess this objective project contribution to
improving preparedness in preventing the transmission of avian influenza from birds to other
animals and to humans is examined along the following dimensions:

        Capacity to prevent avian influenza from occurring in humans and other animals
         through precautionary measures, including vaccines and medicines
        Capacity to detect and diagnose disease in humans and other animals and transport
         samples

4.11 Capacity to prevent avian influenza from occurring in humans and animals: The
information campaign supported under the project has improved awareness of measures for
disease prevention and safe handling of poultry meat. The Project Technical Annex (World
Bank 2006b) found that seasonal influenza vaccination was very limited in the country at the
time of project approval and vaccination uptake is reported to have increased by the
Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) because of better awareness, though it
does not say by how much. Overall, stakeholders in the country also report greater awareness
of the importance of priority vaccination for vulnerable groups as per WHO guidelines. That
said, a large amount of HINI vaccine went to waste because of lack of demand. IEG mission
discussions with government officials revealed that one of the reasons for the lack of demand
in this case was the late arrival of the HINI vaccine in the country and once that pandemic
peaked it was natural for the demand to fall.

4.12 Some capacity in procuring vaccines for humans in a timely manner has likely also
been built because of the project, though attribution is difficult. This is an important
achievement for a small country such as Albania that may have limited bargaining power
with multilateral companies to procure vaccines during an emergency.

17
  OIE undertakes a Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) analysis to assess the conformity of the
veterinary services in a given country with OIE standards. The PVS tool is recognized by all OIE members and
donors as the reference tool for the evaluation of veterinary services. Governments that are striving to achieve
international standards request OIE to undertake the evaluation.
                                                         20


4.13 The project provided for stockpiling of anti-viral drugs for humans. The ICR reported
that around 7,000 doses of Tamiflu (expiry date 2017) are available for the next expected
wave of influenza in the country. While stockpiles, if not used, may be a waste of resources,
there was overall positive learning from the experience. A procurement system to secure anti-
virals quickly from the only producing company (Roche) that has two main distributors in
Albania has been put in place.

4.14 Capacity to detect and diagnose avian influenza among humans and animals. For
detection and diagnosis, laboratory testing of the virus is critical.18 On the human health
side, the project provided support for the complete reconstruction of the virology laboratory
at the Institute of Public Health to upgrade it at biosecurity level 2 (BSL2) standards and one
section was also upgraded to BSL3. The (reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) 19 test equipment was installed and the upgraded laboratory has made it possible to
do molecular diagnoses. Laboratory staff were trained extensively and are capable of
performing tests for diseases such as hepatitis, measles, rubella and avian influenza. The
virology laboratory was certified by WHO and is a part of the Global Flu Network. The
National Influenza Laboratory is being accredited.

4.15 On the veterinary side also, the laboratory at the Institute of Food Safety and
Veterinary was equipped with RT-PCR equipment and is capable of undertaking routine tests
for avian influenza and other diseases. Laboratory staff received training in undertaking
tests.

4.16 The project provided training in internationally acceptable norms for transporting
samples and by November 15, 2007 International Air Transport Association (IATA)
procedures (for example, triple-packaging) were in place for packaging potentially dangerous
specimens sent to reference laboratories overseas. Until recently, Albania sent samples for
confirmation of veterinary diseases to the OIE reference laboratory in the United Kingdom.
Similarly, for human testing for virus diseases, samples had to also be sent overseas (such as.
to the Cantacuzino Institute, Romania). The project support for laboratories has enabled
Albania to test for numerous animal and human diseases in country. However, such state of
the art facility is available only in Tirana; the animal health laboratories in the regions
continue to be poorly equipped and face personnel and budget shortages.



18
  Evidence of the critical role of laboratories can be found in the literature. See for example Pertric and others
2006 where it is noted that “Laboratory diagnosis of influenza has become a cornerstone of the prevention,
containment, surveillance, and treatment of the associated illness. The emergence of novel, highly pathogenic
avian influenza viruses, such as H5N1, has extended the role of the laboratory to include isolation and
subtyping of the virus for disease surveillance and vaccine development. …Laboratory testing for influenza has
historically been of questionable value for the management of patients with influenza, because of limited test
sensitivity, long turnaround times, and a lack of effective antiviral therapies. The development of more rapid
and accurate tests for the detection of influenza now enables the laboratory to provide a prompt, definitive
diagnosis, which allows clinicians to initiate antiviral therapy, limit the injudicious use of antibacterials,
implement appropriate infection-control measures, decrease the duration of hospitalization, reduce ancillary
testing, and decrease health care costs.?

     The RT-PCR is one of the most sensitive tests for diagnosis of influenza.

4.17 Overall, the project contribution to achievement of this objective is assessed as
substantial.

Prepare for a potential pandemic of avian influenza transmissible between
humans
4.18 The criteria for determining the level of preparedness and responsiveness for avian
influenza as gleaned from WHO/FAO/OIE documents and conversations with staff from
these organizations. Briefly, they include:
        A communications strategy
        Surveillance in birds and in humans
        Diagnostic capacity for identification of the disease in birds and in humans
        A control strategy for animals
        Health care response capacity, with stockpiles of anit-virals and vaccines
        A legal and regulatory framework
        Simulation exercises
        Coordination between donors and between ministries

4.19 The extent to which the project helped Albania prepare for, control and respond to
influenza pandemics is assessed against these criteria in the last column of the Table in
Annex C. A National Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan was prepared and regional
training was carried out for hospital pandemic preparedness based on the preparedness
checklist for pandemic influenza. Laboratories at both the Institute of Food Safety and
Veterinary and the Institute of Public Health can test for avian influenza and other diseases in
animals and humans. In fact, staff at IPH, have been trained to test for hepatitis, measles, and
rubella, among other diseases. The National Veterinary Epidemiological Unit collects
regular data on all animal diseases and regional veterinary inspectors received refresher
training on diagnosis and control of avian influenza and Newcastle disease as well.
4.20 Albania’s experience with the HINI influenza pandemic during the fall and winter of
2009 provided a test for the level of preparedness of the country and how effectively it could
utilize investments in communication training and awareness-raising, in laboratory and
hospital infrastructure, and in equipment. The information campaign was quickly tailored
towards H1N1, MOH was able to procure the H1N1 vaccines (albeit the supply was delayed)
and antivirals, and the IPH laboratory was able to undertake tests as needed. The ICU at the
Tirana University Hospital Center was also functional.20
4.21 Overall the project contribution to achievement of this objective is assessed as
substantial.



20
  The 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic affected most countries within months of its emergence. Despite early
identification of the virus and massive scale-up of vaccine production, initial responses were largely based on
preexisting pandemic plans due to the pandemic’s rapid spread before the vaccine’s availability months later
(Lee and others 2010).

Minimize the threat posed to humans by other zoonoses
4.22   The project’s contribution to this objective is assessed against the following factors:
      Management practices for other animal products including condition of
       slaughterhouses;
      Capacity to satisfactorily test for zoonotic bacteria and viruses;
      Surveillance and monitoring of avian influenza in wild birds and in backyard
       systems to detect first infections, and systems for surveillance of other zoonoses;
      Farmers’ incentive to report incidence of diseases;
      Measures to prevent infection from spreading among birds and other animals such
       as culling taken in time.

4.23 Animal products management practices: The project contribution (or lack of it) to
improving the conditions for biosecurity in poultry has already been discussed. Other than
contributing to the drafting of the new veterinary law, the project did not contribute to
improvements in other animal product management practices, including conditions of
slaughterhouses or processing of meat and milk products through which zoonoses can spread
(Box 4). Data obtained from IPH shows that the incidence of zoonotic diseases has fallen
over time in the population but it is not possible to attribute this decline to the project.
4.24 Capacity to satisfactorily test. As already noted the project has helped build
capacity in laboratories at the central level for testing for all zoonoses, but is weak at the
regional level.
4.25 Surveillance and monitoring. The project made some contribution in this area
through establishing and equipping the National Veterinary Epidemiological Unit and
expanding its mandate to cover all zoonoses, including avian influenza.
4.26 Farmers’ incentives. A compensation system exists in the country although the
project did not make a contribution to its establishment.
4.27 Measures to prevent infection from spreading. The animal health component as
originally designed was to provide for the purchase of two properly equipped mobile sub-units
for culling and disposal of infected and at-risk poultry. The ICR notes that these mobile units
were not bought because the main method of disposal for infected birds is burial in a pit and
since the two incidents in 2006, there have been no further outbreaks. However, the project
Environmental Assessment and Management Plan found that at Peze Helmes, where one of the
two outbreaks had occurred, the burial hole was poorly sited with high risk for ground and
water contamination. The assessment noted that the project would provide training to farmers
on proper burial pit construction. There is no mention of such training being carried out in the
ICR. Whatever the existing practices and their safety level for disposal of diseased animals
other than poultry, the project did not make a contribution in this area.
4.28 Overall the project’s contribution to achievement of this objective is assessed as
modest.

Box 4: Slaughterhouses and conditions for management of food of animal origin
There are no specific slaughterhouses for poultry in Albania. None of the three large commercial egg
producing poultry establishments that the IEG mission visited had attached slaughter houses. Poultry
meat from backyard farms is prized highly in Albania and there is an accepted practice of selling (and
buying on the consumer side) only live birds from farmers that ensures that diseased birds normally
do not exchange hands. However, imported poultry meat is widely available and it is difficult to know
how far it has been tested for zoonoses. The OIE assessment (OIE 2008) found that there was no
continuous program for monitoring of food-born zoonosis in the country in accordance with
international standards, although it noted that checks on the basis of samples were often carried out.
Large animals are slaughtered in slaughterhouses around the country, although, as in the case of
poultry, imported meat is also available. The IEG mission visited one of these slaughterhouses in
Korce district. A veterinarian was present on site at the time of the visit and described how the
animals were inspected before slaughter and the kind of precautions that were taken to prevent
disease transmission. However, the overall conditions at the slaughterhouse did not appear very
hygienic, with the slaughterhouse open to flies and insects. The OIE assessment also noted several
deficiencies in the slaughterhouse that was visited by the team. That assessment noted that raw milk
production, quality, and transport of milk are not in accordance with international standards.

5. Efficiency
5.1     Efficiency analysis for a project that is helping prepare a country for a potentially
catastrophic, but unpredictable event is difficult. The recent outbreaks have not yet led to an
avian influenza pandemic among humans, but the risk that it could happen in the future
remains.21 In Albania there were also no human cases of avian influenza arising from contact
with infected poultry, as there were in several other countries (see Annex B). There were,
however, two outbreaks in poultry before the project became effective and none after
effectiveness even though, given the low level of biosecurity, there was a high risk that they
could occur. Partly because of the lack of further outbreaks the project was restructured and
its scope broadened. In the following paragraphs project efficiency is assessed keeping in
mind the disease scenario in Albania—a high risk situation because of low biosecurity, no
human pandemic yet, no human infections even from contact with infected poultry, only two
outbreaks in poultry before project effectiveness.

5.2     Cost-benefit analysis: There were avian influenza outbreaks in poultry in Albania
prior to the project, and therefore the analysis undertaken at appraisal and completion based
on probabilities associated with incidence and spread of avian influenza in poultry seems a
reasonable exercise to undertake. The analysis at appraisal assumed that with the project the
probability of both sporadic outbreaks and widespread outbreaks among poultry would fall:

         Without the project, the probability of continued sporadic outbreaks was assumed to
          be certain (100 percent) whereas that of a widespread outbreak was assumed to
          increase from 40 percent in year one to 50 percent in year three.

                                                 24


         With the project the probability of both sporadic and a widespread outbreak was
          assumed to fall. The with and without project analysis based on the assumptions in
          Table 2 showed an internal rate of return of 44 percent. A sensitivity analysis
          suggested that the project would break even if it succeeded in reducing the probability
          of a widespread outbreak by 3.5 percent in each year.

5.3     Given that the avian influenza outbreak did not occur and the project objective was
revised to include other zoonotic diseases, a re-estimated cost and benefit stream comparison
was neither considered relevant nor undertaken for comparison at the completion stage.
Many factors could influence the probability levels both for continued sporadic and
widespread outbreaks, and these in turn would determine the actual value of the rate of
return. The price of the bird would also not likely remain constant as was assumed in the
appraisal analysis, but could actually fall, as people may be worried about consuming poultry
products. Hence, this assessment finds it difficult to accept the estimated rates of return as
calculated at appraisal. Having said that, the overall argument that the probability would fall
with the project appears reasonable given that the project was attempting to strengthen the
country’s capacity to prevent the spread of avian influenza and prepare it for a pandemic.

5.4     Cost-effectiveness. Both the design of the operation and the efficient use of project
resources affect the cost-effectiveness as implemented. Broadening the scope of the project
to other zoonoses likely improved the cost-effectiveness of the operation in terms of cost-
sharing of laboratory activities and capacity with other diseases. However, the design
included a compensation fund that was not really needed, since the government had already
responded quickly to earlier outbreaks. As a result, the funds were unused until they were
reallocated toward the end of the project, an inefficiency in design. There were a number of
shortcomings in implementation that reduced the efficient use of project resources. There
were major delays in implementing the emergency project, which had disbursed only 11
percent of the IDA funds mid-way through the operation. Lack of experience about
procurement procedures, delayed hiring of key staff, and confusion in reporting lines in
management and implementation structures contributed to delays. There was some wastage
that could have been avoided—for example, only about 40 percent of the HINI vaccine
procured with project resources was actually utilized; the rest could not be used before expiry
because of low demand, due in part to delays in arrival of the vaccine. Finally, the project
was extended and restructured to build the Animal Lab, but the lab wasn’t built and $1.6
                                                    25


million was cancelled. Collectively these shortcomings in efficiency of design and
implementation are significant.

5.5    Efficiencies from donor collaboration: The fact that a range of donors was working
together and not separately—for example, UN agencies working collaboratively with the
Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Consumer Protection—seems to
have also contributed to cost effectiveness in use of project resources. In fact, the public
awareness component spent about 20 percent of the appraisal amount but was still able to
carry out a widespread communication campaign and disseminate critical information
quickly because of the contribution (both in terms of funds and human resources) from
USAID and UNICEF. Foreign technical assistance resources were also effectively utilized,
when, for example, participants from neighboring countries were trained together in a two
week seminar on epidemiology carried out in Tirana for the Epidemiology Units of both
Albania and Kosovo. Because donors including USAID were part of the whole collaborative
approach to improve preparedness, some training was also offered free—for example for
laboratory specialists of IPH who attended training at the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit
in Cairo22 on use of PCR techniques. While these supporting investments from other donors
used real resources provided to Albania that would count as costs in an overall program
economic analysis, they did enhance the leverage of the Bank funding.

5.6     On balance, efficiency is assessed as modest, due to inefficiencies in implementation
and, to some extent, design.

6. Ratings
Outcome
6.1    The project as assessed under the original objectives and as assessed under the
revised objectives is rated moderately satisfactory. Relevance of the original objectives was
High and that of design was Substantial. The project substantially achieved the objectives of
preventing transmission of avian influenza from birds to other animals and to humans, and of
preparing for a potential pandemic of avian influenza transmissible between humans,
whereas it modestly achieved the objective of strengthening Albania’s capacity to prevent the
spread of avian influenza among poultry. Efficiency was Modest.

6.2     Relevance of the revised objectives was Substantial, whereas the relevance of design
was Modest. While the broadening of the objectives embraced the use of the capacity and
laboratory equipment for other zoonoses, other key activities involved in animal product
management – essential to minimizing the threat to humans – were not added. The
objectives of preventing transmission of avian influenza from birds to humans and of

22
  The U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3) is based in Cairo, Egypt. Its goal is to study,
monitor, and detect emerging and re-emerging disease threats of military and public health importance.
NAMRU-3 works closely with the Egyptian Ministry of Health, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH),
WHO, USAID and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). NAMRU-3 has been a WHO
Collaborating Center for HIV/AIDS since 1987. For more information see

preparing for a potential pandemic of avian influenza transmissible between humans were
both substantially achieved, while that of minimizing the threat posed to humans by other
zoonoses was modest.23

 Risk to Development Outcome
6.3     The current recession, particularly the difficult conditions in Europe, have also made
budget and resource positions tighter in Albania. But coordination mechanisms established
between UN agencies (WHO, UNICEF, FAO), OIE, and MAFCP and MOH because of the
project, particularly on communication and awareness raising activities, are likely to ensure
that, were an emergency to arise, resources could be mobilized for disseminating critical
information quickly. The appointment of the Animal Health coordinator as the Chief
Veterinary Officer, the Human Health coordinator as a public health specialist in the MOH
and some of the staff at NVEU in permanent positions with the MAFCP has provided for
some continuity in skills.

6.4      With the passing of the Veterinary Law in September 2011, clearer and more
effective provisions for general disease control in line with EU requirements will likely also
be introduced. But numerous challenges remain. The ICR itself acknowledges the existence
of “legal administrative vacuums, on-going institutional reshuffling and budgetary
restrictions? that affected the sustainability of key project outcomes for the animal health
component (World Bank 2011 p.16).

6.5      The expansion of laboratory capacity has increased the country’s capacity to
undertake tests and research in emerging infectious diseases. However, the increased
capacity also means greater expenditure on operation and maintenance which would be even
more difficult to mobilize under the current tight budget conditions. The BSL3 laboratory in
the Institute of Public Health has not yet been certified and resources to use it effectively are
still an issue particularly for testing for pathogens of diseases other than avian influenza.
Resources for kits, reagents and other basic consumables for the laboratories will continue to
be a constraint. In addition, there is need for continuous training for taking adequate
precautions when dealing with highly dangerous pathogens in high containment biological
research laboratories (BSL3 laboratories for example).24


23
  According to the harmonized evaluation criteria used by the World Bank and IEG, when an operation’s
objectives are revised by restructuring, an outcome rating is assigned for the project under both the original and
the revised objectives, and the two outcome ratings are weighted by the share of the actual credit disbursed
before and after the restructuring to arrive at a single outcome rating. In this instance, however, the outcome
ratings for the project under both the original and revised objectives are identical, so no weighting is necessary.
24
   The high costs associated with continuous training for technicians working in high containment laboratories
were discussed at a workshop of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) where
participants discussed similarities and differences in infrastructure, oversight and personnel training between
biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) and biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories. There was consensus among the
participants at the workshop that “hands-on proficiency training, mentorship, and didactic training are critical
for establishing and evaluating the researcher’s ability to work in a high-containment laboratory; a variety of
individuals, from researchers to administrators and support staff to equipment service personnel, require some
level of training before gaining access to high-containment laboratories; biosafety training programs have to be
flexible to account for the research (one size does not fit all), model systems, facilities, and job function; and the
                                                         27


6.6     Continuity in training is also an issue if the National Veterinary Epidemiologcial Unit
has to effectively serve the purpose for which it was established. During the project the
training of the newly hired staff was given attention.25 An international veterinary
epidemiologist was also hired to train and advise the staff on epidemiology and animal
disease surveillance. However, the project was an emergency intervention and for
veterinarians to become good epidemiologists continuity in training is essential.

6.7    There is also the issue of availability of resources for maintenance of the Intensive
Care Unit at the Tirana University Center. The project would have done well to tie-up its
maintenance with issues of hospital management being addressed under the on-going Health
Systems Modernization Project. There is some linkage between the two projects on hospital
waste management and it could have been undertaken more widely to cover issues of
maintenance of the Intensive Care Unit as well.26

6.8     Overall, under the current conditions, the risk to development outcome is assessed as
significant.

Monitoring and Evaluation
6.9     Design. At design, eight outcome indicators and several intermediate outcome
indicators were proposed. There were four major shortcomings in the results framework.
First, there was disconnect between the project development objective to “strengthen
capacity to prevent and to prepare? and the outcome indicators, which were mainly changes
in behavior or actions taken when an infection had already occurred (Table 3). Second, there
were no indicators to report on the second PDO “to prevent the transmission of avian
influenza from birds to other animals and humans?—see Table 3. Third, given the country
conditions and the weakness in biosecurity, a major factor in the transmission of infection in
poultry, change in the level of biosecurity in poultry management, should have been
monitored. Fourth, as also observed by the completion report, there were too many (28)
intermediate outcome indicators, some of which were only output indicators, making the
monitoring system very complex.




average cost of personnel training varies from $4000-$7000 for researchers to hundreds of dollars to $4000 for
training non-scientists, like administrators.? AAAS 2009. For an explanation of the differences in biosecurity
levels, see Annex B.
25
  The OIE Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) evaluation also found that the training of veterinary staff
tends to be mainly related to internationally funded projects and that the Albanian Veterinary Surgeons
Chamber, though a legal body is as yet not able to regulate the profession (OIE 2008).
26
  For example, the study on waste management was funded by the project. The Health Modernization project
provided funds for incinerators to be installed in hospitals as part of the effort to support better hospital waste
management.

6.10 As designed, the animal and human health coordinators were to report each month on
project activities and on the situation on avian influenza to the Task Force Chairman who
would in-turn report to the Council of Ministers.

6.11 Implementation. Turnover in M&E staff during the project adversely affected
reporting. At restructuring the indicators were revised to reflect the broader project
objectives and several of the indicators at the appraisal stage were dropped. The first two
indicators on behavior change were retained (Table 4) and the total number of outcome
indicators was brought down to seven from the eight at appraisal. Changes were made in the
intermediate outcome indicators but the total number was not reduced.

6.12 UN/USAID also financed two KAP surveys to evaluate the impact of the public
awareness and the communication interventions on behavior change. The surveys were
undertaken in 2006 and then again in 2009, with the former serving as a baseline. The data
collected under the Second KAP survey provided a useful comparison for the information
collected in 2006.

6.13 Use of the data. Overall, the usefulness of the project M&E system was limited for
project management. First, because of the restructuring the project objectives and most of the
outcome indicators changed mid-stream and therefore there were only limited areas where
results could be monitored from start to finish—for example only the first two indicators did
not change with the restructuring but then these did not provide very relevant information in
the first few years. Second, the restructuring happened in October 2009. After the
restructuring the data system shows only two finalized ISRs both of which report on the
outcome indicators as included at appraisal and not the revised ones. The ICR provides
useful information on six of the seven outcome and 14 of the 28 intermediate outcome
indicators. It is not clear why all the indicators included at restructuring are not reported
upon. The KAP survey was used to provide information on some of the outcome and
intermediate outcome indicators.

6.14       Overall, project M&E is rated modest.

Bank Performance
6.15 Quality at Entry. Given the urgency of the situation in the country, the Bank
responded with alacrity to the Borrower‘s request for support, taking advantage of the
flexibility in its procedures under Operational Policy 8.50. The project went from concept
review to approval in under three months, and given the number of steps that are involved in
getting approval, Bank staff must have worked under enormous time pressure.

6.16 The project was relevant to the global emergency and the Bank team appropriately
coordinated with the UN agencies and international technical organizations and helped build
the synergy between the global and national response. The project design incorporated
lessons from Albania’s experience with dealing with the 2006 outbreaks—among others, the
                                                         30


importance of paying compensation rapidly, need to improve biosecurity, and need to address
bottlenecks in surveillance and diagnostics.

6.17     Overall, the design had four strengths.

        First, the project provided for MAFCP and MOH to come together in one
         intervention allowing for a holistic approach to tackling AI;
        Second, recognizing the difficulty in getting staff from different sectors to work
         together, the design realistically provided for a multi-sector, multi agency Task Force
         to take a lead role in project coordination and supervision;
        Third, the project involved cooperation between international technical agencies and
         the World Bank. WHO, FAO and OIE took the lead with the human and animal
         health components and the World Bank providing funding support. UNDP and
         UNICEF were also involved in preparation and implementation. A multi-agency
         mission, including the World Bank, WHO, UNDP, and UNICEF participated in a pre-
         appraisal and technical consultations mission in April 2006. Standards recommended
         by the WHO, FAO and OIE were to be followed in the upgrading/building of
         laboratories, isolation rooms, and in trainings;
        Finally, through a horizontal adaptable program loan (APL), the country-level effort
         was to be coordinated with the global effort to control avian influenza.
6.18 Within the Bank, though the project involved staff from both agriculture and health
sector units, it was slotted under the Agriculture and Rural Development sector and the main
Task Team Leader (there were two over the lifetime of the project) was always from that
sector. Interviews with task team members suggest that this did pose a challenge in terms of
incentives for the health sector staff and there had to be some learning in getting the two
sectors to work together.
6.19 Better understanding of sector-specific issues was needed for some of the training
programs supported. For example, in deciding the emphasis that the project would put on
training of primary health workers on communicable diseases the project could have
benefited from the findings of the Health Sector Note (World Bank 2006a) that showed that
many Albanians by-pass primary care staff , preferring to go directly to hospitals.27
6.20 Operational Policy 8.50 notes the importance of considering urgency when deciding
on support with an emergency project. Though containing an outbreak of avian influenza
through early detection and rapid response was an urgent need, several project activities
supported longer term capacity building and could have been better prepared. An example is
27
   “Due to low perceived quality, bypassing o f primary care in favor of seeking care at polyclinics or hospital
outpatient facilities is widespread even for simple conditions like a cold or a flu. This leads to low utilization of
primary care facilities and extremely low productivity of primary care staff. On average, a primary care doctor
sees only about eight patients per day, with marked regional variations resulting in as few as three visits per day
in certain regions. Analysis of primary care activity in Tirana region further points to substantial inter-facility
variation in productivity. The gatekeeper role that general practitioners (GPs) are expected to play is not
functioning, even though the MOH has introduced a fee system, which would require payment for care by all
those who seek outpatient care directly at a polyclinic or at the hospital. The fee structure, however, is such that
it provides the estimated 60 percent o f the population without a health insurance card with little incentive to see
a primary care physician, particularly if it is felt that the physician will be unable to provide the expected care?
(World Bank 2006a)..

the setting up of the National Veterinary Epidemiological Unit. Supervision missions report
that mid-way through the project there was still a lack of strategic vision and work plan for
the unit. There was also the issue of the Unit’s integration with the epidemiology resources
and information systems developed under an ongoing EU project, which should have been
resolved up front.28
6.21 There were other shortcomings. M&E needed much greater attention. An attempt
should also have been made at drawing a distinction between emergency and non-emergency
activities being supported under the project. Consideration should have been given to
whether the inclusion of the latter could have been avoided to keep the project design less
ambitious. Further, clearly defining lines of responsibility in the implementing agencies
would also have made implementation easier.

6.22     Quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory.

6.23 Quality of Supervision. The Bank continued to give importance to working with
other partners and provided intensive supervision and advice to deal with several
implementation challenges as they arose. Location of the task team leader in the country
office close to the client appears to have helped in this regard. The Bank also played an
important role in encouraging the veterinary service in Albania to contact OIE to undertake a
Performance of Veterinary Services analysis to understand shortcomings and identify
priorities for action.

6.24 However, greater attention should have been given to the quality of M&E and its
utilization. It is a particular weakness that even though the indicators were revised after
restructuring, M&E reporting in ISRs continued on the earlier indicators. Management
oversight was lacking in this regard. Though there were eight outcome indicators at the
design stage the Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRs) reported on only five of
them. There is no explanation as why the five were selected out of the eight for reporting.
There was little information on project outcomes in the initial year as disbursement was very
low and reporting was primarily on activities that were being undertaken and was not useful
for project management—for example, the first five ISRs for two of the five outcome
indicators only note that the “Operational Manual outlines detailed procedures to be
followed? with additional information that they are “On track? in the fourth and fifth ISRs.
On the other three indicators the information provided in the ISRs was mainly output related,
for e.g. for the indicator on behavior change among key veterinary and public health
personnel, the first three ISRs only note that two trainings were completed and that the
baseline KAP questionnaire was developed. Only 8 of the 28 intermediate outcome
indicators were reported on again with no explanation as to why they were prioritized.

6.25 Further, given the weaknesses in the implementation of the animal health component
in the early years, the Bank should have carefully assessed whether it was realistic to expect
that the permit for the Animal Health laboratory would become available and the
construction completed in the short time available before agreeing to the extension. The ISRs
28
  The EU Small Ruminant Project had component activities similar to the project. The EU project had also
developed and was operating a system of field data collection linked to the central server in the Food Safety and
Veterinary Institute.
                                              32


show that the country unit had advised the task team at one point that they consider canceling
the project. Greater discussion between the sector and country units within the World Bank
was warranted before the extension. Further, once the Bank had actually agreed to the
extension, it should have brought pressure to bear at the highest level of Government on
getting the approval of the building permit and completion of the construction before project
closing.

6.26   Quality of supervision is also rated moderately satisfactory.

6.27   Overall Bank Performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
6.28 Government performance. The Government, with the support of the international
community, focused on mounting a rapid response, improving surveillance, and increasing
awareness for avian influenza prevention and control in the country. It also played an
important role in project preparation, and the cross-sectoral nature of the Task Force was
critical to the implementation of a multi-sector intervention. There was also continuity in the
leadership of the Task Force.

6.29 However, in the early period of implementation there was confusion regarding the
reporting lines in the project management and implementation structures which adversely
affected implementation. The Government also could not resolve the issue for the building
permit for the Animal Health laboratory which led to a cancelation of IDA resources. It
should have made greater effort to find a way to resolve the issue of obtaining the building
permit from the Tirana municipality. One way could have been to raise the profile of the
issue to highest levels of Government particularly when it became clear that it was a political
rather than a logistic constraint that did not allow the permit to be obtained from the Tirana
Municipality Committee

6.30   Government performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

6.31 Implementing agencies. There were basically three separate implementing
agencies—the Task Force, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Consumer Protection, and
the Ministry of Health. Overall the Task Force played an important coordinating role and
there was good commitment from the project coordinators. In the initial years however, there
was lack of inter-ministerial coordination and lack of enthusiasm and ownership among some
agencies, particularly the veterinary directorate towards the implementation of the project.
The Task Force as the main implementing agency lacked experience with World Bank
projects, in particular procurement and financial management procedures and this led to
delay in appointment of key staff and in submission of audit reports and negatively affected
project implementation. Capacity in MAFCP to implement the project was weak and the
limited buy-in of project activities by the veterinary directorate in the initial years also
handicapped project implementation. The leadership provided by the MOH could also have
been stronger. However, MOH played a key role in the implementation of the public
awareness and information campaign component and MOH’s role was particularly strong
when the focus of the public awareness campaign shifted to H1N1 in 2009.
                                               33


6.32   Implementing agency performance is assessed as moderately satisfactory.
6.33   Overall Borrower performance is assessed as moderately satisfactory.

7. Lessons
7.1    Building on the project experience this assessment identifies five main lessons:

7.2     In designing an emergency intervention, it is important to distinguish between
immediate response and longer-term capacity building activities to deal with future
emergencies. However, the latter usually benefit from longer preparation and coordination
with other sector interventions. In the Albania project several activities were included that
were not of an emergency nature. The quick preparation that was needed in an emergency
situation did not allow for adequate consideration of the findings of analytical work or for
building coordination with other relevant ongoing Bank sector projects.

7.3     Stronger Management oversight is needed to ensure that project M&E is
actually utilized as a management tool for effective project implementation. In the
Albania project an M&E system was set up but was not utilized for effective management of
the project. Had it been used, the Bank would have known that, given the weaknesses in the
implementation of the animal health component from the very beginning, it was unrealistic to
expect that the permit for the Animal Health Laboratory would become available and the
construction completed in the short time available before project closing.

7.4     Persistent occurrence of H5N1 infections in poultry around the world means
that conditions for the mutation of the virus continue to prevail, including in Albania,
where biosecurity levels remain weak on poultry farms. Greater effort is needed, both
globally and in Albania, to improve surveillance in backyard poultry systems and wildlife to
reduce risks. While increasing awareness, diagnostic and treatment capacity is important,
attention to what all three technical organizations—the WHO, FAO and OIE—have
emphasized “the need to contain highly pathogenic avian influenza at source? needs to be
given priority attention. As Albania strives to conform to EU standards it is likely that efforts
will be made to improve enforcement of biosecurity norms. However, it is too soon to tell
when this would happen. Biosecurity levels are very weak in backyard poultry systems in
Albania where about 85 percent of birds are reared. Even in commercial poultry houses the
level to which sound management practices are adopted is variable. Improving biosecurity
would be important for reducing the chances for the mutation of the virus and hence the risk
that the pandemic occurs.

7.5     Early cooperation with UN agencies and international technical organizations
can offer synergy and provide a basis for sustaining at least some programs on project
closure. Even though budgets are tight, in the case of this project awareness raising activities
will likely not face a shortage since several international organizations came together in
preparing the communication strategy and resources from one or the other source could be
made available were an emergency to arise.
                                           34


7.6    More effective ways of working with the media to communicate disease risks are
needed to avoid panic and build public confidence. While the communication campaign
supported through the project successfully spread the information on the disease, it also
created panic and led to a large number of people moving away from consuming poultry
meat which was harmful for the industry.

Annex B. Background on Influenza and Avian Influenza
Influenza and Avian Influenza (AI).29
Influenza viruses: Influenza in humans can be caused by type A, B or C viruses, with the
former 2 causing most human infections. Influenza A viruses naturally infect humans, as well
as such animals as birds, pigs, and horses, and they generally cause yearly epidemics and,
potentially, pandemics. Infections with influenza B virus are generally restricted to humans
and cause epidemics more rarely.

Avian influenza in birds: Avian influenza is caused by A type viruses that occur naturally
among wild birds that usually do not exhibit symptoms. Avian influenza is very contagious
among birds. Infected birds shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, and feces.
Domestic birds such as chickens, ducks and turkeys can become infected through contact
with infected wild birds, from other infected domestic birds, or through contact with dirt in
cages, water or feed that has been contaminated. Infection in domestic birds can result in
either a low pathogenic form of the disease which may go undetected because of mild, not
very obvious symptoms (such as ruffled feathers or a drop in egg production) or a highly
pathogenic form (where multiple organs get affected) that spread rapidly with mortality rates
that can reach 90 - 100 percent within 48 hours. An example of the latter is the H5N1 virus.
The subtypes differ based on differences in two main proteins on the surface of the virus
(hemagglutinin [HA] and neuraminidase [NA]). There are 16 known HA subtypes and 9
known NA subtypes of influenza A viruses. Many different combinations of HA and NA
proteins are possible. Each combination represents a different subtype.

Human infections with avian influenza viruses: The avian influenza virus does not
normally infect humans but can infect them if they come in contact with infected poultry or
contaminated surfaces. Symptoms of avian influenza in humans range from usual human
influenza-like symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches) to eye infections,
pneumonia, severe respiratory diseases (such as acute respiratory distress), and other life-
threatening complications. The symptoms and severity vary depending on the virus type. The
highly pathogenic H5N1 virus that has recently been circulating in poultry does not as yet
readily circulate in humans. However, where human infections have occurred in contact with
infected poultry the virus has been deadly. As of March 16, 2011, the laboratory-confirmed
human toll stood at 534 cases, including 316 fatalities, representing a case-fatality ratio of 60
percent.30

Pandemic in humans with the avian influenza virus: Annual or seasonal influenza
epidemics are caused by the previous seasons’ viruses or by ones with slight antigenic
changes. In contrast, a pandemic is caused by an influenza A virus that contains

  The actual case-fatality ratio (total number of deaths divided by the total number of cases may be lower
because it is likely that the number of deaths is largely accurately counted as autopsies can confirm the cause of
death as H5N1, but many mild cases may not be counted as the patients may not visit the doctor or the hospital.

hemagglutinin (HA) for which there is no preexisting immunity, facilitating the virus’s rapid
spread throughout the world. Through re-assortment or mutation the avian influenza virus
could become capable of replicating in humans and spreading easily among them. Mutation
occurs when a virus changes its genetic makeup allowing it to transmit from person to
person, whereas re-assortment occurs when two different viruses exchange genetic material.
The re-assortment could happen if animals that are susceptible to both human and avian flu,
such as pigs, become concurrently infected with both kinds of flu. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic
was caused by a virus that emerged from pigs. H3N2, H1N1, and H2N2 are examples of
avian influenza virus types that have, in the past, circulated among humans. Studies confirm
that the 1918-19 Spanish flu likely originated from the re-assortment of avian and human
viruses. Since the 1918 pandemic, the population of the world has grown 3-fold and a severe
pandemic could lead to even more deaths today. The 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2 pandemics
also involved new influenza viruses generated by re-assortment events, and, although they
were less virulent than the 1918 H1N1 virus, they still caused significant morbidity and
mortality. Both of these viruses resulted from re-assortment of a Eurasian wild waterfowl
virus with a previously circulating human H1N1 virus.

For a pandemic to occur through an avian influenza virus, there would need to be three
conditions: (i) a new subtype would have to emerge for which there was little human
immunity; (ii) it would have to infect humans and cause illness; (iii) it would have to spread
easily and sustainably among humans. To date the third condition has not been met because
the virus has not improved its transmissibility among humans. The concern is that, with
ANNEX B                                        43


some re-assortment of genes (through co-infection with two viruses) or adaptive mutation
(that could increase the capability of the virus to bind to human cells), this could occur.
Resistance in current virus strains to one of the two classes of available antiviral drugs as
demonstrated in vitro has added to anxiety about controlling a pandemic if it does occur.

                                                      Between 2003 and 2008, 47 countries
                                                      reported the highly pathogenic H5N1 form
                                                      of avian influenza in their domestic
                                                      poultry (IFPRI 2008). H5N1 was first seen
                                                      in a farmed goose in China in 1996
                                                      (IMCAPI Hanoi 2010). The first outbreak
                                                      was recorded in Korea in December 2003
                                                      (World Bank 2008). By 2004 the virus had
                                                      spread to several East Asian countries and
                                                      by 2006 had reached several Asian,

                                                      countries. Unchecked trade and movement
                                                      of infected poultry was one of the main

High Containment Laboratories
There are four levels of bio-safety laboratories (AAAS 2009, Petric and others 2006). The
lowest level, biosafety level 1 (BSL-1), includes research “involving well-characterized
agents not known to consistently cause disease in immunocompetent adult humans, and
present minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment.? Biosafety
level 2 (BSL-2) includes “work involving agents that pose moderate hazards to personnel and
the environment.? Biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) “is applicable to clinical, diagnostic, teaching,
research, or production facilities where work is performed with indigenous or exotic agents
that may cause serious or potentially lethal disease through inhalation route exposure,? and
requires that laboratory personnel receive specific training in handling pathogenic and
potentially lethal agents, and be supervised by scientists competent in handling infectious
agents and associated procedures. Biosafety level 4 (BSL-4), the highest level, “is required
for work with dangerous and exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of life-threatening
disease, aerosol transmission, or related agent with unknown risk of transmission.?

Notes: *An early warning and response system for infectious disease surveillance was set up in 1999 in Albania as a part of the national
surveillance network. It used a specific software package known as Albanian Epidemiological Reporting Tool (ALERT) which is based on
weekly reporting from primary care systems and hospitals. An external assessment of the system was carried out in 2003. A WHO
consultation carried out in 2006 for strengthening avian influenza preparedness in Albania found the ALERT system to be overall useful
and timely although with some drawbacks.
