SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Ecuador
Emergency Petroleum Reconstruction Project (Loan 2803-EC)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Ecuador - Emergency
Petroleum Reconstruction Project (Loan 2803-EC)" prepared by the Latin America
and the Caribbean Regional Office, with Part II provided by the Borrower.
The primary objective of the project was the timely rehabilitation
of petroleum related facilities damaged by a severe earthquake, including crude
oil and LPG pipelines and the oilfield operated as a joint venture between the
Government owned oil company and an international oil company.  This project
component was carried out within 6 months of Board presentation and within two
weeks of the date estimated at project inception, under the latter's supervision.
In order to save time, procurement was implemented under Limited International
Bidding, LIB (48%), and International Shopping (38%), with no ICB. The PCR notes
that pipeline costs increased from the appraisal estimate of $4.4 million to an
actual $21.1 million even though only 34.5 km of pipeline were replaced, rather
than the appraisal estimate of 78.5 km. As a result, a substantial proportion
of the materials purchased have been stockpiled.
The secondary objective of the project was to increase production
from Petroecuador's oilfields.   This component, while delayed by about three
years, was also successfully implemented.   The compliance of this project
component to the Bank's Guidelines for petroleum lending was not discussed in the
PCR.  The project was less successful in implementing a plan to address the
environmental impact of the disaster and to develop a plan for emergency
preparedness. The PCR makes no mention of the project components related to an
assistance plan for displaced people or actions to clean up disaster related oil
spills and to monitor water quality in the affected areas.
The project has undoubtedly a high economic return. Its outcome is
rated as satisfactory, institutional development as partial and sustainability
of benefits as likely. The PCR is unfortunately silent on some important points
noted above. The project may be audited.

ECUADOR
EMERGENCY PETROLEUM RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(LOAN 2803-EC)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Emergency
Petroleum Reconstruction Project, for which Loan 2803-EC was approved on
May 7, 1987, in the amount of US$80.0 million. The loan was closed on
June 30, 1991, with all but US$0.8 million fully disbursed; the remaining
amount was canceled. The final disbursement application was paid on
November 7, 1991.
Parts I and III of this PCR were prepared by the Infrastructure and
Energy Operations Division, Country Department IV of the Latin America
and the Caribbean Regional Office. The Beneficiary, CEPE (Corporaci6n
Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana, now PETROECUADOR), prepared Part II.
Preparation of this PCR started in January 1993; it is based on the
President's Report, Loan and Guarantee Agreements, supervision reports,
correspondence between the Bank and the Beneficiary, and internal Bank
memoranda.

ECUADOR
EMERGENCY PETROLEUM RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(LOAN 2803-EC)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Project Objectives
1.    The primary objective of the Emergency Petroleum Reconstruction
Project (Loan 2803-EC) was to minimize the cost of the earthquakes of
March 5-6, 1987, by helping to restore oil production and export flows.
Specifically, the project was to (a) undertake necessary oil field maintenance
and reactivation activities to avoid potential long-term damage from the
expected interruption in production; (b) help the Govemment increase oil
production following pipeline repair to compensate for lost production; (c)
minimize environmental damage from the disaster and from reconstruction
operations; (d) enhance the capacity of the Corporaci6n Estatal Petrolera
Ecuatoriana (CEPE) to deal with the crisis; and (e) improve the preparedness
of the Govemment and the region for future national emergencies (para. 3.1).
Project Description
2.    The project included four components: (a) investments for the
reconstruction of the Trans-Ecuadoran Pipeline (TEP); (b) investments for
maintenance and rehabilitation of CEPE's share of the CEPE-Texaco
Consortium oil fields; (c) accelerated development of CEPE's fields in order
to increase production; and (d) technical assistance (para. 3.2).
Project Implementation
3.    Implementation of the project began well, with the Bank approving
Loan 2803-EC just tvv months after the disaster (para. 4.1). Two of the
project components-- reconstruction of the Trans-Ecuadoran Pipeline and
increased production from CEPE oil fields-- were successfully implemented
largely within the time period estimated (paras. 5.1-2).' However, the
project closing date was delayed until 1991, three years later than the original
estimate of 1988, primarily as a result of the very slow implementation of the
technical assistance component (paras. 5.3, 6.3, Thble 1).
Results
4.    The pipeline reconstruction component of the project was successful:
as a result of reconstruction, Ecuador was able to resume oil production and
1. Within two weeks and six months of the estimated time, respectively.



iii-
export, thus securing a yearly net revenue of some US$500 million. The
success of the increased production component allowed Ecuador to repay
loans of crude oil it had received from Venezuela and Nigeria (paras. 5.1-2).
Through the technical assistance component, the environmental awareness of
PETROECUADOR2 and other public and private institutions was improved.
However, the recommendations of the Environmental Management Plan have
not been implemented, and the Emergency Preparedness Study has not yet
been completed (paras. 5.4-5).
5.    The project's economic rate of return was as estimated at inception,
greater than 100% (para. 5.7).
Sustainability
6.    The Emergency Petroleum Reconstruction Project was an emergency
operation. The primary goal of the project, to get production and export of
oil going again following the disaster, was by its very nature a one-time
effort. It succeeded, inasmuch as Ecuador has maintained a daily production
level of approximately 310,000 B/D since the end of 1989 (paras. 5.2, 6.1).
7.    However, completion of certain parts of the technical assistance
component of the project, aimed at improving the Government's ability to
respond effectively to and minimize the negative environmental impact of
future natural disasters, lagged significantly behind implementation of the
physical project components. The Environmental Management Plan has not
been implemented (paras. 5.4-5, 6.3)
Lessons Learned
8.    This operation demonstrates that it is possible to prepare a successful
emergency project in a matter of a few months. The success of several of
this project's components-- e.g., pipeline reconstruction-- was due to a
number of factors: rapid approval and disbursement of the loan; an
emergency situation that demanded (and enjoyed) open communication with
all organizations involved in the project; CEPE's and Texaco's institutional
knowledge of and familiarity with petroleum operations; and assignment of
the management and execution of pipeline reconstruction to Texaco, a
company both technically skilled and familiar with the TEP (paras. 4.2, 7.4,
9.1).
9.    On the other hand, the unfamiliarity of CEPE and other organizations
with the subject matter of the environmental studies they were to conduct led
to numerous delays in the implementation of this component (paras. 7.5,
8.3), as CEPE (later PETROECUADOR) was itself gaining experience in the
process.
2. In 1989, CEPE's name was changed to PETROECUADOR.

Project Name       Emergency Petroleum Reconstruction Project
Loan Number        2803-EC
RVP Unit           Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office
Country            Ecuador
Sector             Energy
Subsector          Petroleum
2. Background
2.1   After Ecuador began to export crude oil in August 1972, the
petroleum sector quickly became the backbone of its economy. For the past
two decades, the economic growth rate has been closely linked to the oil
sector, which is essentially owned and fully controlled by the Government.
The Hydrocarbons Law, issued in 1971, governs the sector; it established
both the sectoral pricing policy and the institutional framework responsible
for regulation, exploration, production, and distribution activities in the
sector.
2.2   Pricing policy in Ecuador has been highly politicized and, except for
short periods, heavily subsidized. The interpretation of the Hydrocarbons
Law has resulted in very low internal prices compared to the opportunity cost
of external sales. In fact, subsidies on domestic sales of petroleum
derivatives have averaged close to US$330 million annually, or
approximately 2.8 percent of GDP over the last six years.
2.3   The institutional centerpiece of the Hydrocarbons Law was the
creation of the Corporaci6n Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana (CEPE) in 1972 as
a public entity under the authority of the current Ministry of Energy and
Mines. The law required all sector activities, from exploration to final sales
to the public, to be carried out either by CEPE or with its participation and
under its supervision. As a result of these restrictions, private participation
in the oil business remains limited, though modifications to the Hydrocarbons
Law in 1982 allowed foreign oil companies to explore in selected areas under
service contracts, with CEPE acting as the contracting agent for the
Government. According to the law, oil fields were to be operated by both
CEPE and the CEPE-Texaco Consortium (operated by Texaco). In 1989,
CEPE was converted to PETROECUADOR, which, as a result of subsequent
acquisitions and takeovers, now engages in all aspects of petroleum



2
operations, ranging from production to operation of the Trans-Ecuadoran
Pipeline, refineries, and the distribution system.
2.4   On March 5 and 6, 1987, tuw powerful earthquakes struck the
northeastern area of Ecuador, where 99.5% of the country's total oil
production is located. About 16 kilometers of the Trans-Ecuadoran Pipeline,
which connects the production fields to the refinery and export terminal,
were destroyed, as were 18 kilometers of the Shushufindi-Quito LPG
Pipeline. As a result, Ecuador lost its main source of revenue, since
petroleum at the time accounted for 11 percent of GDP and about half of
exports.
3. Project Objectives and Description
3.1   Project Objectives. The primary objective of the project was to
support Ecuador in restoring oil production and export flows so as to
minimize the cost of interrupted oil production to the economy. Specifically,
the project would help: (i) avoid potential long-term damage to the fields due
to the expected interruption in production by undertaking necessary oil field
maintenance and reactivation operations; (ii) enable the country to boost oil
extraction to about 320,000 B/D following pipeline reconstruction to
compensate for lost production; (iii) minimize the environmental impact of
the disasters and related reconstruction programs; (iv) enhance CEPE's
capacity to deal with the crisis and its aftermath; and (v) enhance the
Government's and the region's preparedness for future national emergencies.
3.2   Project Description. The project included four components:
(a)   Investments directly related to the reconstruction of the
Trans-Ecuadoran Pipeline, including:
(i)  replacement/repair of 33 km of the 26" crude line
between Salado and Lumbaqui;
(ii)  replacement of a 44 km stretch of the 6" LPG line;
(iii)  replacement of a 1.5 km stretch of the production line
between Bermejo and Lumbaqui;
(iv)  reconstruction of two major and three minor bridges;
(v)  repair of the Salado pumping station;
(vi)  repair of pipeline telecommunications facilities;
(vii)  reconditioning of the Balao maritime terminal; and
(viii)  clean-up of the remaining oil spills.
(b)   Investments required to maintain and rehabilitate the
CEPE-Texaco Consortium fields, including:
(i)  drilling of 8 wells in the Shushufindi, Sacha, and
Guanta fields;
(ii)  workover of 68 wells and pump replacements and
repairs; and
(iii)  related well services, tubulars and well site preparation.



3
(c)    Accelerated development of CEPE's fields, including:
(i) drilling and completion of 20 wells in the Libertador,
Bermejo, Tetete-Tapi and Tiguino fields;
(ii) rehabilitation of 12 wells and completion of Pichincha,
Bermejo, Tiguino and Tetete-Tapi production stations
and related surface facilities; and
(iii) infrastructure and logistics.
(d)    Technical assistance, including:
(i) engineering and management (provided by Texaco) and
services of monitoring consultants, related to
reconstruction of the Trans-Ecuadoran Pipeline;
(ii) studies to be undertaken by CEPE regarding the
expansion and/or rerouting of the Trans-Ecuadoran
Pipeline, and possible follow-up to the environmental
impact study;3 and
(iii) an Emergency Preparedness Study to be carried out by
the National Civil Defense Authority, recommending
arrangements to ensure proper institutional coordination
during future emergencies, and assisting in their
implementation (see Table 5-B).
4. Project Design and Implementation
4.1    Soon after the earthquakes, a Bank damage assessment mission visited
Ecuador at the request of the Government. Due to the urgency of the
situation, preparation and design of an emergency project lasted only weeks;
the Bank approved Loan 2803-EC, with CEPE as Beneficiary, scarcely two
months after the earthquakes. Through a participation agreement signed by
the Ecuadoran Government and CEPE, proceeds of the loan were made
available to CEPE as a contribution to its capital.
4.2    As part of the Loan, CEPE and the Bank signed a Project Agreement
appointing Texaco as the project executive unit, and CEPE and Texaco
signed the MC-E-0-2029 Agreement, giving Texaco authority to act as an
intermediary for project implementation. Thus, the project was able to
benefit from Texaco's pool of operations and maintenance technicians, who
were familiar with TEP (Texaco was its contracted operator), and who were
able to begin implementation of the project immediately (as the disaster had
put a temporary halt to regular work). CEPE was also able to avail itself of
3. The reference is to an environmental impact assessment study (Evaluaci6n del Impacto
Ambiental del Sismo en la Amazonia) of the earthquakes that was begun during project
preparation by Fundaci6n Natura with USAID funding. The initial intent was to prepare an
environmental action plan under the project that would take into account the conclusions of
this study, and to implement the plan. During project implementation, the scope of the
action plan was expanded to include the development of an Environmental Management Plan
for all sector activities (see Table 5-B).

Texaco's extensive procurement and contracting groups and facilities. These
fortuitous circumstances, in addition to the selection of a very experienced
contractor, were instrumental in the successful execution of the reconstruction
component.
4.3   Texaco invited international firms to take part in the bidding; the main
pipeline construction contract was awarded to Wilbross International, Inc.
4.4   Because many of the damaged areas were inaccessible, even by
helicopter, information available for preparation of the pipeline reconstruction
component was scanty and unreliable. This explains the discrepancy between
the estimated length of destroyed pipeline (78.5 krm) and the actual length
(34.5 km), resulting in the stockpiling of a significant quantity of 6- and 26-
inch pipes in CEPE's warehouses against future emergencies.
5. Project Results
5.1   In spite of the emergency nature of the project, which precluded
careful planning, the critical reconstruction component was completed within
two weeks of the date estimated at project inception. Thanks to this success,
Ecuador was able to resume crude oil production and transport for local
consumption and exports. For an investment of about US$100 million,
Ecuador secured a yearly net revenue of some US$500 million.
5.2   The increased oil production component enabled the country to reach
a production level of 310,000 B/D by the end of 1989,4 enabling it, inter
alia, to repay loans in crude oil owed to Venezuela and Nigeria. This level
was 10,000 B/D short of the project target; however, such results are not
uncommon in petroleum operations, particularly when dealing with several
oil fields. Ultimately, an investment of some US$33 million generated a
yearly net revenue of approximately the same amount.
5.3   Within the context of the environmental portion of the project, an
Environmental Management Plan for PETROECUADOR was prepared (see
footnote 3). This plan was intended as a guide for the environmentally
responsible development of the petroleum sector, and included an
Environmental Manual of Operations and an Oil Spill Contingency Plan. In
addition, a comprehensive study of the impact of the petroleum industry on
the environment was prepared (see Table 5-B). The study assigned overall
responsibility for the integrity of and public and private compliance with
environmental guidelines in the oil sector to PETROECUADOR, and
recommended a number of activities that would increase compliance. It took
PETROECUADOR nearly three years to select the consultants for, and
finally launch, the study. The lengthy delay was likely due to
PETROECUADOR's unfamiliarity with the subject.
4. When the component was basically completed.



5
5.4   As a result of the study and related activities, the environmental
awareness of many public institutions and private enterprises was increased;
in addition, the study gave PETROECUADOR an enhanced awareness of its
role as a leader in the environmental field vis-a-vis the petroleum subsector,
and prompted it to organize a new Environmental Assessment Unit.
However, none of the staff of this new unit was deployed to the field,
decreasing the unit's potential usefulness. In addition, the recommendations
of the Environmental Management Plan have not been implemented.
5.5   Under the emergency preparedness portion of the project (within the
technical assistance component), the National Civil Defense Authority
reviewed the earthquake history of Ecuador as far back as the 1500s and
prepared a detailed seismological map of the country. However, an
Emergency Preparedness Study that was to outline procedures for coping
with future disasters has not been completed.
5.6   PETROECUADOR has been audited by independent auditors for the
years 1987-1991. New systems of accounting, financial reporting,
management information and cost control have been deployed with the
assistance of management consultants; these systems should reduce
inefficiency and improve the company's profitability.
5.7   The project had a rate of return greater than 100%, as estimated at
project inception.
6. Project Sustainability
6.1   The Emergency Petroleum Reconstruction Project was an emergency
operation. The primary goal of the project, to get production and export of
oil going again following the disaster, was by its very nature a one-time
effort. It succeeded, inasmuch as Ecuador has maintained a daily production
level of approximately 310,000 B/D since the end of 1989.
6.2   Because Ecuador has resigned from OPEC, it is not subject to a
production quota; therefore, as long as demand for its crude oil remains at
current levels and crude oil prices remain in the 18 to 22 dollars per barrel
range, the results of the project should continue to provide significant
economic benefits to the country and to the subsector. It should not be
difficult to maintain production at current levels, or even to increase it, by
in-fill drilling or by using secondary and tertiary recovery techniques; also,
the discovery of new fields is probable. There is a potential for future
earthquake damage; however, the TEP has been buried under one meter of
earth in the most earthquake-prone areas, which should make it invulnerable
to falling rocks and reduce damage from mud slides.
6.3   Completion of certain parts of the technical assistance component of
the project, aimed at improving the Government's ability to respond
effectively to and minimize the negative environmental impact of future



6
natural disasters, lagged significantly behind implementation of the physical
project components. The Environmental Management Plan has not been
implemented (see paras. 5.4-5)
7. Bank Performance
7.1   The Bank's response to the emergency situation in Ecuador was swift:
Bank staff were sent to Ecuador within days of the earthquakes, and the time
lag between reconnaissance and negotiations was reduced to 45 days. Loan
2803-EC was approved just 60 days following the earthquakes and became
effective shortly thereafter. At the outset, the Bank requested that CEPE
establish a monthly reporting system by special project control and
monitoring consultants, which contributed to savings and increased
efficiency.
7.2   There was particularly intense supervision until pipeline reconstruction
was completed; afterwards, missions focused on oil field workovers and on
drilling and environmental activities. A number of missions for other Bank
projects provided additional supervision for this project,5 especially
regarding the progress of PETROECUADOR in preparing and implementing
the Environmental Management Plan.
7.3   The environmental activities under this project received a high level of
international attention; in fact, the Environmental Management Plan has been
labelled an important contribution to the field.
7.4   Lessons Learned This operation demonstrates that it is possible to
prepare a successful emergency project in a matter of a few months. The
success of several project components-- e.g., pipeline reconstruction-- was
due to a number of factors: rapid approval and disbursement of the loan; an
emergency situation which demanded (and enjoyed) open communication
among all organizations involved in the project; CEPE's and Texaco's
institutional knowledge of and familiarity with petroleum operations; and
assignment of the management and execution of pipeline reconstruction to
Texaco, an agency both technically skilled and familiar with the TEP.
7.5   On the other hand, the unfamiliarity of CEPE and other organizations
in charge of implementing the studies on the environment (part of the
technical assistance component) with the subject matter of these studies led to
numerous delays in the implementation of this component, as CEPE (later
PETROECUADOR) was itself gaining experience in the process.
5. Including the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), the proposed
Oil Production Development Project (later cancelled), and the proposed Environmenal
Technical Assistance Project.



7
8. Beneficiary's Performance
8.1   Pipeline reconstruction was completed quickly, by mid-August 1987.
CEPE's role with respect to this component6 was mainly that of a passive
observer, since Texaco had been commissioned to do the engineering and
supervision and had staff available in both the field and the U.S.
8.2   CEPE ran the operation of the other physical components-- well
workovers and drilling-- with contractors. These components were not
completed until late 1989, (a) because of delays in road construction and
subsequent inaccessibility of the drilling sites, and (b) because complex
reservoir simulation studies were required prior to final selection of fields
and drill sites. Results of the simulation studies prompted several changes in
project implementation that lengthened the implementation period.7
8.3   Several technical assistance activities were not completed. Most
importantly, the Emergency Preparedness Study has not been completed, and
the recommendations of the Environmental Management Plan have not been
implemented. Among the problems attending the preparation and
implementation of these studies were: managerial indecision, delays in
selecting consultants, unfamiliarity with the subject matter of the studies,
difficulty in defining their scope, and suboptimal interinstitutional
coordination. The long-term assignment of specialists or consultants to these
activities might have shortened their implementation periods. The Bank
requested that PETROECUADOR submit a proposal for the implementation
of the Environmental Management Plan. Three such proposals have since
been submitted; however, a final decision on implementation has not yet been
made.
9. Project Relationships
9.1   Because the physical components of the project were of highest
priority to the Government, all doors were open at all levels of the
organizations involved in the project, which greatly facilitated
implementation.
10. Consulting Services
10.1  The first consultant hired for the project was Texaco (U.S.), a
consortium partner of CEPE and operator (under control) of the Trans-
Ecuadoran Pipeline. Texaco was hired to manage and supervise pipeline
reconstruction, and provided a very experienced project manager and two

7. For instance, oil fields selected fbr drilling were not those that had been identified at
project inception.



8
engineers. The remaining staff were provided by the CEPE/Texaco
Consortium and did a creditable job.
10.2 Morrison Knudsem (U.S.) was hired to provide project and cost-
control specialists and to prepare monthly progress reports on the pipeline
reconstruction component. Its team was very effective and from the outset
provided suggestions that shortened the implementation period and reduced
costs.
10.3 AMBIENTEC (Colombia) and ESEN (Ecuador) were hired in
partnership to develop the study on environmental management. The study
was issued in 1991 after twelve months of work. It established a framework
for CEPE to monitor the impact of petroleum activities on the environment,
and for the environment-related interactions of various organizations.
10.4 After many false starts, the National Civil Defense Authority was
eventually commissioned to do the Emergency Preparedness Study. The
Authority prepared a very comprehensive seismological map of Ecuador, but
the Emergency Preparedness Study has not yet been completed.
11. Project Documentation and Data
11.1  There was no Staff Appraisal Report for this project due to the time
constraints of the emergency situation. The President's Memorandum served
as the framework for legal documents and for all steps regarding project
implementation.
11.2 Periodic reports from the Borrower, together with supervision reports
and correspondence in the project files, facilitated the preparation of this
PCR. The Borrower's cooperation was especially useful in preparing the
project costs and financing tables.

EMERGENCY PETROLEUM RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(LOAN 2803-EC)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART H: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE
BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1. The Borrower complied with Part II of the Project Completion
Guidelines by preparing a Project Completion Report sent under Note No.
83-ADF-92 of January 12, 1993. The report will be forwarded to LAC Files
for reference.
2. All but one of the project components were executed within the period
planned and the amount disbursed under the loan accounts for 99.31% of the
allocated funds. An analysis of the Borrower's report allows us to make the
following comments:
(a)   Bank's Ferformance. The Beneficiary is satisfied with the Bank's
performance during the evolution and implementation of the project,
underlining some considerations:
- the total amount of project investment was US$102 million, 78% of which
was financed by Loan 2803-EC;
- the preparation of the project lasted approximately 45 days, and the first
disbursement was made 60 days after the Borrower's request, which was a
record time for Ecuador and possibly for the Bank as well;
- the Bank contributed extensively to the preparation and definition of the
strategy and activities for pipeline reconstruction under emergency
conditions;
- during project implementation, the Bank played a key role in ensuring and
improving execution, since it followed closely all construction and
procurement schedules and disbursements. Supervision was sufficient and
effective, resulting in the provision of timely advice on corrective measures
in all aspects of project execution.
(b)  Borrower's FPerformance. From the very beginning, the
Beneficiary rapidly began to fulfill the commitments established by the legal
documents. Apart from the legal and institutional transformation of the
former state oil company, CEPE, into PETROECUADOR, new entities had
to be created with direct responsibility in different areas of project execution.
In spite of this, the time required to process loan disbursements was kept to a
minimum. Both the earthquakes and the Bank support demonstrated the need
to protect the environment, particularly in view of increasing petroleum
activities. Studies of the major seismic risk areas and proposals for
mechanisms to tackle the consequences of earthquakes were also required.



10
(c)   Relationship between the Bank and the Beneficiary. An
excellent relationship between the Bank and PETROECUADOR was built
from the start. This bilateral cooperation contributed to overcoming
difficulties and to solving problems rapidly throughout the whole operation.
PETROECUADOR's personnel benefitted from the technical, managerial and
economic expertise of Bank staff.
