MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED SECOND EDUCATION CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the People's Republic of Mozambique for SDR 38.7 million (US$53.7
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity. It would help finance a second
education project.  The project would be financed on a parallel basis by UNDP
for approximately US$4.8 million.
2.      Background.  Confronted with severe economic problems in 1987, caused
by security problems, debilitating external shocks, and inappropriate economic
policies, the Government of Mozambique began to pursue an extensive adjustment
program. In its current phase (1990-1992) the Economic and Social
Rehabilitation Program, as it is now called, places strong emphasis on poverty
reduction and social sector development, with particular attention to
improving education.
3.      The principal issues confronting the education sector at this time
concern the need to improve quality and efficiency, especially in primary
education, within the confines of very limited resources. The current
education system is extremely deficient, due in part to large inadequacies in
the availability and quality of instructional materials, teachers, and school
facilities. The war has led to the destruction of over half of all primary
schools, and most of the remaining facilities are badly dilapidated. Only
about 50 percent of primary school age children are enrolled, compared to 73
percent for sub-Saharan Africa. Dropout and repetition rates are high: for
each primary school graduate, the system expends 28.6 student-years worth o_
resources -- 4.7 times as much as if every student went through without
setback. Similar losses are also pervasive at higher levels. At the
university level, quality is poor and costs have skyrocketed as a result of
low enrollments and high boarding and staff costs. The low number of
graduaten is insufficient to respond to the country's manpower needs.
Management and planning in the sector are weak and there is insufficient
coordination of national and donor resources in education to ensure that the
limited resources are directed toward the highest priority needs of the
sector.
4.      Recognizing the extent and urgency of the challenges it faces, the
Government has prepared a comprehensive sectoral plan, which was developed
with assistance from IDA in the context of (i) the implementation of the first
IDA education project (Education and Manpower Development Project, Credit
1907-MOZ, effective October 1988), (ii) the preparation of this proposed
second project, and (iii) the analysis done for the recent Public Expenditure
Review and Country Economic Memorandum. As part of this process, Government
presented the plan to a donor coordination meeting for a ten-year education
strategy and a development plan covering the first three years of that period.
This meeting led to consensus on the direction of the education sector and the
development of this project. Priority will be given to improving quality and
efficiency, through the strengthening of inputs (textbooks, teacher training,
curricula, etc.). The resulting reduction in wastage will free up more school



-2-
places for additional students. Expansion through investment in new schools
will be minimal initially, then increase in the second half of the ten year
period. Other priorities include strengthening post-secondary education and
skill development at all levels, to contribute to relieving the country's
extreme shortages of skilled manpower and specialists in key professions. A
crucial part of this effort will be to revitalize the university, particularly
in the teaching of economics, engineering and the basic scie.ces.
S.      Many donors have been supporting the education sector, including: the
World Food Program (food for boarding schools); NORAD (provision of
textbooks); SIDA (curriculum evaluation, textbook adaptation and free
distribution, educational research and improvements in the Ministry of
Education's (MINED) management); AFDB (rehabilitation of teacher training
centers); UNICEF (teacher training, community outreach and special programs
for war traumatized children); FINNIDA (rehabilitation of the secondary school
in Nacala); and UNDP (education planning). NGOs work with the educational
needs of the 500,000 children among the displaced population. At the
University, numerous donors assist with staffing and scholarships. The EEC is
financing construction and equipment for remedial science teaching during the
first semester. The Netherlands contributes to this program as well with
technical assistance and is continuing its assistance to the science
faculties. The Rockefeller and Gulbenkian Foundations are both assisting the
University with studies useful for strategic management development. The
donor coordination meeting recognized the need for donors to work more closely
in education and follow-up meetings are taking place.
6.      Proiect Objectives.  The main objective is to facilitate the
implementation of the ten year sector development plan, focusing especially
on: (i) improving quality and efficiency in primary education through
strengthening critical and strategic inputs to effective learning; (ii)
upgrading the effectiveness of the university for national capacity-building
in essential skill specialties, by improving teaching of the basic sciences,
engineering and economics and by promoting better long-range strategic
planning at the university; and (iii) strengthening the management of the
education sector.
7.      Proiect Description.  In line with these objectives, the project will
support improvements in: (i) primary education through financing of pre-
service and in-service teacher training; pedagogical support and distance
education; rehabilitation and limited expansion of schools in Maputo Province
and City, Dondo, Beira and Nacala; and pilot-testing of five quality-
improvement initiatives (i.e., local language instruction, flooding classrooms
with reading materials, student achievement testing, extramural programs and
student health interventions); (ii) university education through the
strengthening the faculties of economics, engineering and the basic sciences,
and through further refining the university's ten-year development program;
and (iii) management in the education sector through improvements in planning
and financial management, training of ministry personnel, and establishment of
maintenance systems.

8.      A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and the allocation of the proposed IDA
credit by disbursement category and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B.  A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Mozambique are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively.  Maps No. 22385 and 22466 are attached.  The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 8676-MOZ, dated November 15, 1990 is also attached.
9.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The ten-year strategy for education
that the Government has developed with IDA assistance, and the major steps
that must now be taken to implement the strategy, are crucial elements of the
Government's overall Economic and Social Recovery Program. Success will
require resolution of numerous complex issues for which Mozambique has limited
experience and capacity, and thus requires assistance. Other external
assistance agencies are unable to meet this need entirely, and both they and
the Government are looking to IDA to play a significant role in supporting the
restructuring and reconstruction of the sector.
10.     Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to implement the long-term
development plan outlined in its Letter of Education Development Policy and
the attached Action Matrix. Specifically, in line with its ten year
development plan, the Government has agreed to do the following: as a
condition of Credit Effectiveness: select and employ the agreed key staff
members at GEPE (Education Projects Management Unit) with qualifications
satisfactory to IDA; as Conditions of disbursement: (a) for the schools to be
constructed and rehabilitated, present a legally binding agreement with SIDA
on the financing of a textbook policy and program; present a detailed
implementation plan to IDA for the five primary education initiatives and
carry out the site resettlement plan satisfactorily; and, (b) for the rental
of radio studios in the distance education pilot project, present evidence
that it has entered into a satisfactory contract providing rental at cost (for
educational purposes) rather than at commercial rates. During negotiations,
the Government also agreed to the following dated covenants: by July 31, 1991,
complete and furnish to IDA a plan for the implementation of a longer school
year to be implemented in 1992; by December 31, 1992, complete and furnish to
IDA a subsector plan for higher education; by December 31, 1993, complete and
furnish to IDA a subsector plan for vocationalltechnical education; annually,
by October 31, conduct an implementation review jointly with IDA; include in
its budget from 1993 on, the amounts needed to maintain its new university
structures, and from 1996 on, the amounts needed to maintain its new or
rehabilitated primary schools; and annually, by March 31, provide evidence to
IDA that it has complied with the agreed budget allocations to the sector and
taken steps to ensure that the recurrent salary bill in the Ministry of
Education and the University is not increased due to this project.
11.     Benefits and Risks.  The project will contribute significantly to
furthering the goals of the Government's Economic and Social Rehabilitation
Program in regard to educational development. Specifically, the project will
improve the management of the education sector, make more classrooms available
for primary education, enhance the teaching of science, engineering and
economics at the university, and improve efficiency in education at all
levels. At the primary level, children in four cities would benefit from



- 4 -
additional classrooms. In Maputo, the project will provide a tbird of all
classrooms needed by 1993, and in Beira, Dondo and Nacala, the project would
provide between 60 and 70Z of all classrooms required by 1993. The main risks
are three. First, the continuing civil unrest might disrupt project execution
or damage project assets. To minimize this risk, the project will focus on
the secure areas, which include most urban and semi-urban centers and some
rural districts. Second, the limited capacity of the implementing
institutions might delay implementation. To mitigate this possibility, the
project includes measures to strengthen implementation capacity. Third, the
substantial coordination required among the many Government and donor agencies
involved may be hard to sustain during the six-year project lifetime. To
address this issue, a thorough consultation process has been undertaken during
project preparation, involving a series of workshops and seminars and a donor
conference, and plans have been made to continue this process during project
implementation with annual project seminars.
12.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
