MEMORANDM WAND RECOMNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NALAYSIA
FOR A THIRD PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recomendation
on a proposed loan to Malaysia for the equivalent of US$141.0 million to help
finance a third sector project for primary and secondary education. The loan
would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of
17 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.        CountrX/Sector Background. Since 1970, Malaysia has experienced rapid
and accelerating economic growth, while drastically reducing poverty. The Sixth
Development Plan (1991-95) reaffirms the dual objectives of growth and equity.
These are to be achieved through a diversification of the productive base towards
high-tech, high value-added fields; an increased role for the private sector; and
greater reliance on productivity gains. With GDP projected to grow at 7.5%, and
employment, at 3%, p.a. during the 1990s, Malaysia aims to become fully
industrialized by 2020 ("Vision 2020").
3.        Education has always figured prominently in Government's development
plans and has consistently been backed by substantial allocations (15.4% of the
Sixth Plan's investment program; 19.6% of total recurrent budget in 1992, and
about 6% of GNP). A large, rather centralized, and mostly Government-financed
education system has been developed.   In terms of access, universal primary
education (UPE) has been achieved, although gross enrollment ratios in
lower/upper secondary and in higher education are only 83%, 49%, and 9%,
respectively.   The gender gap has been closed at the primary and secondary
levels, and educational parity has practically been reached across ethnic groups.
In terms of quality, retention rates are high. Accomplishments in primary and
secondary education include the introduction of an innovative, environmentally-
oriented curriculum, a well-managed book publishing and distribution system, a
large teacher training system, and Resource Center support.   Despite this
generally favorable picture, the sector faces a number of issues.   Broad
geographic disparities persist in access to schooling, and capacity constraints
still exist.   Quality-wise,  there are still urban-rural discrepancies in
achievements. Finally, there is scope for improving efficiency, as the search
for excellence and the relative lack of fiscal constraints have led to high unit
costs (25% above the regional average in the late 1980s) and educational
recurrent budget allocations have increased substantially faster than total
Government recurrent budget allocations, mainly due to liberal staffing ratios
and salary increases.
4.        The country's bid  to become  fully  industrialized by  2020 has
considerable quantitative and qualitative implications and poses additional
challenges for the education/training sector. The proposed transformation of the
economy will require a larger pool of better educated secondary graduates.
Achievements need to be raised in mathematics, science and communication skills
to meet the demands of a sophisticated labor market.   Efficiency gains and
alternative delivery and financing modes (such as distance education, cost-
recovery, privatization) are all the more necessary in view of the fact that the
Sixth Plan also proposes major new investments, notably in vocational/technical
(VTE) and higher education, which are expensive sub-sectors; while justified,
these might put pressure on the recurrent resources available for primary and
secondary general education.   For these two levels, the Plan is within the



- 2 -
Ministry of Education' s (MOE) proven absorptive capacity. Government bas decided
to give priority to: (a) maintaining UPE; (b) universalizing lower secondary
education; (c) improving the physical environment where substandard cl"asrooms
threaten achievements; (d) strengthening the network of Resource Centers; and (e)
requiring all secondary teachers to be university degree holders.
5.     Government and the Bank have agreed on a core inmestment program (CIP),
to be supported by the Bank (about US$800 million, or 80% of the Sixth Plan's
primary and general secondary allocation).   Given the sophistication of
Malaysia's sectoral management, it has been agreed that, by contrast to the first
two sector projects, which were based on physical investments, Bank support for
the proposed operation would essentially follow a financial time-slice approach,
which gives Government flexibility in substituting, from year to year, sub-
projects forming part of the CIP. In view of the magnitude of the CIP, it was
also recognized that its implementation would have to be stretched over seven
years; this, in turn, led to an agreement to split CIO funding into two time-
slices to reduce commitment charges on the Bank Loan. The first of these two
time-slices would cover a 4 year period (1993-96) with an estimated cost of about
US$340 million equivalent. This amount also covers three conventional (software)
project components.
6.        ProXect Objectives and Policy Framework.  The proposed Third Sector
Project would be a major element of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy, which
focuses increasingly on the Human Resource Sectors, with a dual emphasis on basic
social services to promote equity and advanced technologies to raise
productivity. It would support the CIP in (a) promoting educational quality so
an to produce graduates who are either immediately trainable for a competitive
job market, or who have mastered the higher-order problem-solving skills required
for tertiary education; (b) expanding equitable access, giving priority to
disadvantaged areas or schools; and (c) improving the efficiency of sectoral
resource mnagement. It would be based on a policy framework involving a Letter
of Policy and an Action Plan, including implementation criteria and monitorable
performance indicators. The Letter of Policy emphasizes: (i) continued efforts
to equalize educational opportunities; (ii) greater flexibility in responding to
local needs; (iii) the systematic monitoring of measures to improve the
effectiveness of the delivery system and reduce unit costs; and (iv) containment
of the growth of sectoral recurrent expenditures.
7.        Project Description.   The Project, or first time-slice (1993-96),
would improve: (a) educational quality (about 16% of total cost) through: the
provision of about 3,000 teacher training places; institution-building in the
network of Resource Centers; provision of distance education, open learning and
library programs and materials; a Program to promote Innovation, Excellence and
Research (PIER) with a focus on maths/science achievements, small rural schools,
pilot operations in communications technology and educational research;
(b) egultable acgess (about 80% of total cost) through: experimental support to
early childhood development and special education; construction/rehabilitation
and equipping of about 4,400 primary and 3,200 secondary classrooms; and
provision of housing for about 3,000 teachers and boarding facilities for about
20,000 rural students; and (c) the efficiency of management (about 4% of total
costs) through: a staff development program for about 1,000 senior and middle
level managerial and technical personrel, to be implemented under twinning
arrangements with reputable universities/institutions; upgrading of the existing



Educational Management Information System (EMIS) for policy and decision-making;
and strengthening project management/implementation capabilities.
8.        The project would cost US$342.0 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$141.0 million equivalent (41% of total project cost) and
taxes estimated at US$7.9 million equivalent. The Bank Loan would amount to
US$ 141.0 million, equivalent to 1008 of the foreign exchange component and 42%
of total project cost net of taxes and duties. As Sixth Plan implementation is
an ongoing process, retroactive financing, up to 10% of the Loan amount, would
be included to cover early Sixth Plan expenditures after July 1, 1992. This
would be the first sector project following a financial time-slice format. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Malaysia are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No 10518-MA, dated November 9, 1992,
is being distributed separately. Maps are also attached.
9.        Project Imnlementation.  The project would be managed by a Project
Management Team (PMT) headed by an experienced director, and consisting of staff
from MOE's existing Development and Supply Division (DSD) and Educational
Planning and Research Division (EPRD). An efficient entity, PMT/DSD has recently
been further strengthened under two separate projects. Implementation criteria
have been established. Each year, PNT would prepare for Bank approval a detailed
expenditure plan for the next year and an indicative budget outlay for the
following years. Eligible CIP items could be substituted from year to year
within agreed ceilings.   Supervision would alternate broad, quantitatively
oriented annual reviews with interim reviews focusing on priority quality issues,
often in the form of workshops. An in-depth mid-term review would be hold at
end-1994.
10.       Prolect Sustainability.    By the end of the Sixth Plan, sectoral
expenditures are projected to be roughly 708 higher than in 1990. The Project's
recurrent costs would be equal to 13.2% of the increase, or 3.1% of MOE's
recurrent budget in 1996.  This would require increases of about 8% p.a.,
slightly above the 7% projected revenue growth, and is therefore broadly feasible
if MOE's present share of recurrent expenditures is maintained. This apparent
ease assumes no further increases in unit costs, no pressures due to unexpected
or unquantified expansion in other parts of the sector, and buoyant Government
revenues. The project includes adequate provision for recurrent funding of new
facilities. Issues of recurrent cost analysis, cost-recovery and privatization,
efficiency and the need for broad fiscal reform to finance the social sectors lie
at the heart of the macro and sectoral dialogue, and Government is committed to
addressing them.
11.       Lessons Learned from Prevlous Bank Involvement.  Concerns emerging
from the existing PCRs and PPARs and from on-going supervision work relate to:
(a) implementation delays and disbursement lags due to slow site acquisition,
cumbersome reimbursement processing procedures, and understaffing of DSD; (b) a
tendency to follow liberal space norms and cost standards, and to hastily expand
capacity or upgrade technologies, leading to high costs and occasional
underutilization; and (c) the limited impact of software components due to weak
linkages with the issues being addressed and Insufficient follow-up. The project
would respond to these concerns by: (i) including advance planning mechanisms,



-4-
streamlined reimbursement procedures, and provision for adequate staffing; (it)
monitoring norms and efficiency, and ensuring that the introduction of new
technologies is supported by adequate budgets; and (iii) linking training,
studies and specialist services under twinning arrangements managed by a
specially created MOE unit.
12.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  With this project, the close working
relationship built between the Government and the Bank over twenty-two years of
cooperation in the education sector would continue in a new phase. The types of
non-financial inputs for which Bank involvement has been appreciated -- a
constructive sector-wide policy dialogue, assistance in sharpening the focus of
programs, and institution-building -- would now be applied to the new educational
challenges raised by the refocusing of the economy mapped out in Vision 2020 and
the Sixth Plan. The financing of the social sectors has already become a central
theme of the overall policy dialogue with Government. The project would provide
an opportunity to discuss future sectoral policy issues, including efficiency,
the need for increasingly sophisticated management tools (EMIS, M&E), and the
strengthening of capacity for innovation and introduction of cutting-edge
technologies such as distance education and open-learning.         Helping the
Malaysian education system to meet the skill demands implicit in the transiti-
to newly industrialized country status would also mean supporting an education.
model of relevance to other Bank borrowers, especially rapidly industrializing
countries and culturally diverse societies.
13.       Agreed Actions. A Letter of Policy has been signed and an Action Plan
approved by the Government.   In addition, Government has agreed to:   (a)
implement the project as indicated in the Letter of Policy, and as specified in
the Action Plan; (b) beginning in FY93, develop and subsequently introduce
efficiency measures and budgetary norms satisfactory to the Bank to contain the
growth of Primary and Secondary education recurrent expenditures while ensuring
that the share of such expenditures allocated to pedagogic materials and
administrative costs is maintained at no less than its average 1991-92 level; (c)
develop and implement mechanisms to monitor educational recurrent expenditures
and a formula to maintain the real value of the per capita grants to (primary and
secondary) schools at no less than their 1991 level; (d) ensure that all project-
related research, studies and pilot-operations would be conducted on the basis
of arrangements, including terms of reference, satisfactory to the Bank; (e)
ensure that not later than school year 93-94, NOE would introduce in a sample of
schools a Year 3 math criterion-referenced test and monitor/analyze the results;
(f) ensure that not later than March 1, 1993, MOE would enter into contractual
arrangements satisfactory to the Bank with appropriate institutions or
universities for implementation of the PIER and the EMIS components; and
(g) maintain and enforce regulations (introduced in May 1992) to prohibit the use
of cement-asbestos materials in project school and educational buildings.
14.       Evronmental AsRects.  The project would promote general awareness
of environmental issues and interest in environment-related scientific streams
through its support of a new, ecology-conscious curriculum and funding of school
based science projects. It would also provide for a safer school environment by
banning asbestos-cement materials from new school construction.
15.       Poverty Alleviation and Women in Development.   The project would
contribute to the achievement of Government's goal of eradicating hardcore
poverty. As the gender gap has been closed in primary and secondary education,



-5-
the project would explore and introduce measures to encourage girls to seek
admission into the more technical and managerial streams, leading to more
remunerative professions.
16.       Prolect Benefits.   The Project would create some 253,000 student
places; this would help Government to maintain UPE, to increase secondary
capacity by about 8%, and to directly enhance the environment of substandard
schools. However, its main benefits would be of a qualitative nature, as quality
inputs and the emphasis placed on research, M&E and management would improve the
system's ability to efficiently produce graduates equipped with the skills,
attitudes and values required to maximize the productivity of the large
investments planned in knowledge-based industries, VTE and higher education.
17.       Risks. At the groject level, there is a risk of implementation delays
and disbursement lags as experienced in previous projects. Measures recently
adopted concerning site acquisition, civil works supervision and disbursement
requests processing have begun to show results and are expected to minimize the
recurrence of these types of problems. The other two risks relate more to the
Plan. One is that, at the macro level, sustainability might become problematic
if all of the sectoral investments in the Sixth Plan (notably in higher education
and VTE) were to materialize simultaneously and under the present high unit
cost/low cost-recovery regime. This risk is considered manageable given the
quality of the macro and sectoral dialogue concerning fiscal reform and the
financing of the social sectors and Malaysia's strong record in human resource
development.   The third risk is that of slow implementation of key policy
measures of a sensitive nature. The commitments expressed in the Letter of
Policy and the focus of the Annual Implementation Reviews should be adequate
safeguards against this risk.
18.       R comendati  .  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
