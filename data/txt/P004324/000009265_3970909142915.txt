IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA
THIRD PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR PROJECT
(LOAN 3536-MA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Third Primary and
Secondary Education Sector Project in Malaysia, for which Loan 3536-MA in the amount
of US$141 million was approved on December 8, 1992 and made effective on March 12,
1993. The loan was closed on December 31, 1996, as scheduled. Final disbursement
took place on May 13, 1997 at which time the remaining balance of about US$4.48
million, or about 3.2% of the loan amount was cancelled.
The ICR is based on the findings of the Bank's final supervision mission to
Malaysia from January 25 to February 1, 1997, discussions of the findings with the
Borrower, inputs from former task managers, and materials in the project files. The
report was prepared by William D. Cooper (Education and Training Consultant) and
Robert McGough (EA1HR) and reviewed by Messrs. Sven Burmester (Division Chief,
EA1HR) and Walter Schwermer (Project Advisor, EA1DR). The Borrower has provided
its own evaluation of project implementation. This has been included in an unedited form
in Annex 2.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA
THIRD PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR PROJECT
(LOAN 3536-MA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
1.    The Third Primary and Secondary Education Project was financed by Loan 3536-MA, for
the amount of US$141.0 million. The beneficiary of the loan was the Ministry of Education
(MOE). The loan became effective on March 12, 1993 and was closed on December 31, 1996.
A four-month grace period was agreed upon to allow for the completion of disbursements for
expenditures incurred before the closing date. At loan closing, there was an undisbursed balance
of US$4.48 million, or about 3.2% of the original loan amount which was cancelled. The last
disbursement was made on May 13, 1997.
2.    This project was the Bank's third loan for primary and secondary education to Malaysia
and the tenth in a series of education operations since 1969. The first two loans (Loans 2685-
MA and 2987-MA, respectively) financed increased access to, and improvement of, the quality
of primary and secondary education. Both loans were closed on December 31, 1992.
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.    The objectives of the Third Primary and Secondary Education Project were to: (a)
promote the quality of primary and secondary teaching and learning through teacher training and
upgrading, the delivery of high-quality curricula, and innovations in mathematics and science
teaching; (b) expand equitable access to education through a national program of school
construction and the provision of teacher housing and student boarding facilities; and (c)
strengthen education sector management through staff training and the establishment of a
management information system.
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
4.    The project objectives to increase access to primary and secondary education were fully
achieved. Objectives for improving the quality of primary and secondary education were for the
most part achieved and are moving in an upward trend. Education sector management has not
yet been improved significantly, although many of the project's initiatives are now planned for
implementation over the next several years.'/
/ The Borrower's commitment to complete the quality improvement programs after the loan's closing date was
reconfirmed during the ICR mission (January 1997).



ii
SUSTAINABILITY
5.    There is good evidence to assume that the outcomes of the project will be fully sustained
by the Government in the foreseeable future. The Ministry has significant financial resources
and a well established framework of policies to support the required maintenance, staffing and
operation of primary and secondary schools that were established through this project.
Furthermore, MOE has already demonstrated a commitment to extend the existing objectives of
the project to increase student access to primary and secondary education in the more remote
areas of the country. This has resulted in the Government being able to exceed many of the
original performance indicators of the project.
BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE
6.    The Bank's performance had some shortcomings, but overall, it was considered
satisfactory. During project preparation, significant inputs were provided from Bank staff and
consultants. The Bank also provided a significant amount of technical assistance during the
startup phase of the project when some refinement was needed to improve the implementation
plan for the major software components. Although early participation by the Bank was notable
in some regards, there was some friction between Bank staff and their counterparts. Later, the
frequency of supervision missions was not fully adequate and the staffing mix could have been
better.
BORROWER PERFORMANCE
7.    Borrower performance was generally satisfactory. Project preparation was competently
carried out by the Government. The project management entity in the MOE competently carried
out its functions of managing the project, coordinating and monitoring project inputs, and
maintaining contact with the Bank and the international education community. However,
weaknesses in keeping project accounts and the late submission of audits persisted throughout
the implementation period. Consultant recruitment also experienced delays which had a negative
effect on the achievement of the qualitative outcomes of the project.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, FUTURE OPERATION AND KEY LESSONS LEARNED
8.    Findings.  Overall, the implementation and outcomes of the project are rated as
satisfactory, although there were some less than satisfactory aspects of the project. Despite the
complexity of project design and the large scope of the construction program which placed
considerable demands on MOE's implementation capacity, project outcomes are rated as
satisfactory with respect to capacity expansion in primary and secondary education, the
provision of teacher housing and student hostels, expanding teacher training and improving its
quality, and upgrading Ministry of Education staff. The quality of primary and secondary
education has been improved. This is evidenced by higher student achievements, particularly in
English language and in secondary school mathematics and science. Achievements obtained
under the experimental Program for Innovation and Excellence and Research (PIER) are not yet
obvious and could not be evaluated. The Education Management Information System (EMIS)
was not implemented as planned and thus, was rated as unsatisfactory. The indicators for
internal efficiency of primary and secondary education did not improve over the project period.



iii
9.    There were three identified factors that positively affected the project. These were: (i)
strong and sustained Government commitment to the objective of moving Malaysia's education
system into the scientific and technological age, and adequate budgetary resources to finance the
change process; (ii) a well-developed decentralized education structure capable of managing
programs at the state, regional and district levels; and (iii) a competent local contracting industry
with sufficient capacity to deliver an ambitious school construction program.
10.   There were three identified factors that had some negative effects on the implementation
of the project: (i) the complexity of the quality enhancement program made it difficult to prepare
and implement. Because of this, there was a need to make changes in its design during the first
years of the project's implementation; (ii) there was an early agreement by the Bank to
reallocate loan proceeds to civil works as soon as the original loan allocation was exhausted.
With this decision, MOE focused more heavily on the expansion of the construction components
of the project. Less project attention was given to the improvement of quality of instructional
materials, instructional methods, curricula and staffing; and (iii) there were delays in resolving
taxation and advance payment clauses in Technical Assistance (TA) contracts which led to late
starts of key quality improvement components.
11.   The original project design included the possibility of Bank financing of the next time-
slice (1997-2000) of the Government's core investment program for primary and secondary
education under a follow-up operation. In late 1996, however, the Government decided not to
pursue this option because it had decided to reduce it borrowing for social sector projects.
Therefore, the Bank has no plans for a follow-up project in primary and secondary education.
12.   Lessons Learned. The project provides the following lessons for the education sector:
(a)   During any sector investment operation, if the Bank agrees early in the life of a
project to reallocate large amounts from the "software" categories to the
"hardware categories", too much emphasis may be placed on the achievement of
fast disbursements for civil works.
(b)   There is a risk that the Bank will overestimate the Government's commitment and
its implementation capacity when overly complex components and
subcomponents are planned in projects.
(c)   Delayed submissions of audit reports are often a problem in education sector
investments where contracts and disbursements are handled by regional or local
offices that are located some distance from the central administrative unit.
(d)   Inadequate commitment to loan/project supervision often results in project
management problems that could have been corrected early in the project's
implementation.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA
THIRD PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR PROJECT
(LOAN 3536-MA)
PART 1: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.   PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.    Project objectives supported the human resource development thrust of Malaysia's
Sixth Development Plan (1991-95) and supported its long-term goal of reaching newly-
industrialized country (NIC) status by the year 2020 (Vision 2020). The project aimed to:
(a) promote the quality of primary and secondary teaching and learning through teacher
training and upgrading, the delivery of high-quality curricula, and innovations in
mathematics and science teaching; (b) expand equitable access to education through a
national program of school construction and the provision of teacher housing and student
boarding facilities: and (c) strengthen education sector management through staff training
and setting up a management information system. Project objectives correctly identified
the main sector issues of access and instructional quality summarized in the
Government's 1992 Statement of Education Policy. They were clearly stated and
consistent with the Bank's investment strategy in Malaysia.
2.    The project was not without risk. The scope of the civil works program was
formidable, while the "software" components (quality enhancement, staff development,
and operational research) were complex and not fully developed during project
preparation. The risks of implementation delays in civil works and the potential failure
of some software components were identified at appraisal. However, given the MOE's
experience with managing two previous education sector projects, the civil works
program was considered to be within the Borrower's implementation capacity. As for the
software program, Bank staff and consultants did provide strong support in the early
stages of implementation to counterbalance the limitations of MOE in these areas,
however, there is evidence of some early miscommunication and disagreement between
the Bank staff and the Government which limited the effectiveness of this support.
B.    ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.    The Project objectives to increase access to primary and secondary education were
fully achieved. Objectives for improving the quality of primary and secondary education
were for the most part achieved and are moving in an upward trend. Education sector
management has not yet been improved significantly, although many of the project's



2
initiatives are now planned for implementation over the next several years. 2/ The
following sections summarize project outcomes:
Promoting the Quality of Primary and Secondary Education
4.    Outcome Indicators. The overall outcomes are positive (Table 5: Key Indicators
of Project Implementation). For the national (Malay) schools, the transition rate from
primary to secondary school has improved from 86.7% in 1990 to 92.5% in 1996.
Teacher training and upgrading was expanded and improved, and more than half of all
secondary teachers had university degrees in 1996, up from one-third at the start of the
period. Criterion referenced tests were introduced in 1993, primary and secondary school
leaving examinations were revised, curricula and textbooks were updated, and emphasis
was placed on mathematics and science. Student achievement in secondary school
mathematics and science was up by 9% and 11% respectively over the period. The
quality of education is improving in Chinese and Tamil schools but continues to lag
behind Malay schools.
5.    Teacher Professional Development Program (TPDP). The outcome of this
program has exceeded most of the appraisal targets. The overseas component of TPDP
provided short-duration non-degree programs for teachers, teacher trainers and staff of
MOE's teacher education division in subject matter content, curriculum development,
teaching methodology, materials development and support services, as well as long-
duration post-graduate programs at masters and Ph.D. levels. At project completion, the
overseas program had trained more than 330 participants in short courses (120 planned)
and 45 masters and Ph.D. candidates (30 planned). The TPDP's local training program,
conducted by staff that had returned from overseas training (multiplier effect),
implemented training for more than 2,900 teachers, lecturers of TTCs and MOE staff.
6.    Teacher Training Colleges (TTCs). The original plan to construct six TTCs
with a total of 3,000 teacher training places was changed to two TTCs of 1,000 places
each, with the remaining four TTCs to be financed under a follow-up operation (second
time slice). Two TTCs at Besut and Kangar are under construction, with completion
scheduled for February and May 1998, respectively. Equipment, furniture and library
books are on order. The total cost of these colleges, estimated at RM 120 million, is
financed by Government funds. Since the Government has decided not to proceed with
another project for primary and secondary education, teacher training capacity will only
have been increased by about 2,000 training places which is 1,000 less than is required to
meet the staffing requirements of the country over the next decade.
7.    Distance Education.  The MOE's Educational Technology Division (ETD),
responsible for developing distance education programs, has produced ETV materials and
media kits, focused mainly on teacher upgrading in mathematics, science and language in
2 / See Footnote 1.



3
upper primary and lower secondary education. These resources are being used in schools
which have TV/VCRs. The ETD resource center is hooked up, via telephone lines, with
one secondary school in each of the 14 states thus providing communication with teachers
participating in this pilot distance education operation The pilot will be evaluated before
more work is done on this mode of communication. Although there is significant
potential for the use of distance education concepts and technology to meet the unique
geographic/demographic needs in rural education, ETD did not forcefully pursue the
innovative technologies that would be required such as computer links, satellite TV or
radio reception in remote schools. Thus, the project fell short of the intended outcomes in
this subcomponent.
8.    Resource Centers. A study by University of Science Malaysia (USM) on the
operation and management of four State Education Resource Centers (SERCs) slated for
upgrading under the project (located at Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang and Kedah) was
completed in 1994. Requirements for their extension were identified which include, for
each SERC: (i) 6 lecture rooms, 4 workshops, 1 production room, 1 exhibition room, 1
computer laboratory and a meeting room; (ii) a 100-bed hostel; (iii) a multi-purpose hall,
and (iv) an extension to the canteen. These extensions are under implementation, with
local funds, and are expected to be completed in 1997.
9.    Library Endowments. A media equipment inventory and media utilization study
was completed by USM in June 1994. The resulting plan to provide existing schools
with media equipment was not implemented due to budgetary constraints. However,
audio-visual equipment is being supplied to new schools through launching grants. By
project closing, about 750,000 library books had been delivered to project schools.
Books for non-project schools (but part of the core program) were also financed by the
loan. In spite of these efforts, books and other library materials are still in short supply in
most primary and secondary schools, particularly in rural areas.
10.   Program for Innovation, Excellence and Research (PIER). This innovative
program was quite ambitious in its design and expected outcomes. It was started late due
to delays in recruiting technical assistance and was reduced in scope as a result. Results
of its four sub-programs are as follows:
(i) Innovations in Science and Mathematics Program developed a significant
number of training modules and teaching materials targeting teachers and
students in primary and lower-secondary schools, and lecturers in TTCs;
(ii) Small and Isolated Schools Program developed and piloted over 200 self-
instructional training modules in English and mathematics for teachers and
students, including those in multigrade and aboriginal schools;
(iii) Professional Development of In-service Teachers through Distance
Education was a program that developed and piloted a 28-week
correspondence program (equivalent to a regular 14-week TTC teaching



4
certificate program) using telephone tutorials (not radio/TV as planned in the
SAR) and trained some 220 teachers (see distance education above); and
(iv) Educational Research Program financed 22 research projects related to
education policy analysis, budgeting and monitoring, conducted by local
universities, and trained about 800 education officers and teachers in the
development of action-research projects which in turn led to the financing of
about 740 small-scale action-research projects in teaching methods and school
administration at the school level.
11.   Based on a January 1996 mid-term review and a December 1996 end-of-mission
report, the Government has prepared a second phase (PIER II, 1997-2000) to complete,
and in some areas, extend the original program. Funds have been appropriated for PIER
II in 1997.
Expanding Equitable Access to Education
12.   Outcome Indicators. Primary school construction kept pace with demand. More
than 98 percent of civil works went into expanding capacity, and more than 10,000
primary and secondary classrooms were added to the system, exceeding project targets.
Double-shift teaching in primary schools increased rather than decreased, evidence of
continuing strong demand, but overcrowding remained a problem as classes of over 46
were not eliminated. Female participation rates stayed the same in primary (48.7%),
decreased in lower-secondary (48.7%) but increased significantly in upper-secondary
(52.9%) and higher education (65.7%).
13.   School Construction.  The construction of primary and secondary schools,
student hostels and teacher housing was successfully implemented, exceeding appraisal
targets in most cases. At project completion, the Bank loan had financed the construction
of 7,302 primary classrooms (766 schools) and 3,253 secondary classrooms (274
schools), compared to appraisal targets of 4,420 and 3,132 classrooms, respectively.
Targets for teacher housing were exceeded (4,140 units built vs. 3,000 planned), while
student boarding places were below the appraisal target (7,320 places completed vs.
13,090 scheduled). The Government indicated that the data used in the determination of
the appraisal was not accurate. Later figures allowed for a more refined estimate which,
in turn, justified the modification of the targets as mentioned above. To finance this
overall program increase, the Bank agreed to reallocate loan proceeds and increased
funding for civil works by about 40 percent. The remainder of the core program is
expected to be completed with Government funding by end 1997. Table 1 below
summarizes the status of the program at project completion:

Improving the Efficiency of Education Management
14.   Outcome Indicators.  The staff development program  for educators, and
administrative and management staff of MOE has been implemented as planned. The
impact of this program is not yet fully evident as many of the project trained staff are just
now returning from their training assignments and are assuming new jobs and
responsibilities. The education management information system (EMIS) was not
implemented due to a very late start on the design work. Education sector financing
increased significantly, from 19.3 percent of the Government's total recurrent budget in
1990 to 22.3 percent in 1995, due in large part to required financing for civil service
salary increases. Unit costs increased at all levels of education.
15.   Staff development. This program was designed to train 1,300 MOE staff in the
teaching and learning process; education management, cost and finance; and special fields
such as early childhood education and special education. The project was coordinated by
the EPRD. The overseas training component financed 44 post-graduate students at
masters and Ph.D. levels; short-term fellowships and operational attachments for about
870 MOE staff, regional education officers and school principals; and in-country training
in mathematics and science conducted by visiting professors for about 1,135 MOE staff.
As of December 31, 1996, the total number trained overseas was about 2,000 staff vs.
1,300 planned at appraisal.
16.   The local training component financed M.Ed. programs for 72 education officers
at local universities, and short duration courses mainly in computer knowledge for 2,436



6
officers. In addition, many staff, who completed training abroad, subsequently developed
and implemented training programs in their respective institutions to pass their newly
acquired knowledge on to more than 20,000 teachers.
17.   Education Management Information System (EMIS).  The EMIS was to
provide the MOE with a tool for policy analysis, management and decision making.
Implementation was delayed by two years due to late signing of a consultant contract.
The consultant's scope of work was reduced to system design and the preparation of a
detailed implementation plan, both of which were delivered just prior to the project
completion date. In support of the EMIS, the MOE developed an integrated data base,
ready for pilot testing in early 1997 and full census collection in mid-1997; and
implemented a staff training program in policy analysis, economics of education,
budgeting, database management, and GIS school location planning. This training
program was well executed. The EMIS plan is comprehensive and of good quality, and is
scheduled be implemented in 1997/98 with Government funds. The extent to which the
EMIS, once fully implemented, will strengthen the MOE's capacity for policy analysis,
management and decision making remains to be evaluated.
C.   IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING
THE PROJECT
18.   The most important factor that positively affected the project was: (i) strong and
sustained Government commitment to move Malaysia's education system into the
scientific and technological age. Although there were some shortcomings in the
timeliness and the amount of funding for some sector needs (i.e., books and instructional
supplies), there was a provision of adequate and timely budgetary resources to establish
education infrastructure, and to train and employ staff to support increased access for
students in the rural areas.  Other positive factors include: (ii) a well-developed
decentralized education structure capable of managing programs at the state, regional and
district levels; and (iii) a competent local contracting industry with sufficient capacity to
deliver an ambitious school construction program.
19.   Factors that had a negative effect on project implementation and contributed to
delays include: (i) the complexity of the quality enhancement program, which for the
most part remained undeveloped after appraisal and was only addressed during
implementation; (ii) early agreement by the Bank (October 1993) to reallocate loan
proceeds to civil works as soon as the original loan allocation was exhausted, which
encouraged the Government to focus on construction, not on quality improvements; and
(iii) significant delays in resolving taxation and advance payment clauses in TA contracts,
which led to very late starts of key quality improvement components such as the EMIS
and the PIER.



7
D.   PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
20.   There is good evidence to assume that the outcomes of the project will be fully
sustained by the Government in the foreseeable future. The Government remains
strongly committed to its vision for year 2020, for which a dynamic and technologically
up-to-date education system is a prerequisite. For 1997, this commitment has been
translated into budgetary provisions required to complete project items that have
remained unfinished at project completion. MOE has already extended the existing
objectives of the project to increase student access to primary and secondary education in
the more remote areas of the country. This has resulted in the Government being able to
exceed many of the original performance indicators of the project. Furthermore, MOE
has a well established framework of policies to support the required maintenance, staffing
and operation of primary and secondary schools that were established through this
project.
E.  BANK PERFORMANCE
21.   The Bank's performance had some shortcomings, but overall, it was considered
satisfactory. The Bank's performance was satisfactory during project preparation and
appraisal but there was some friction between the Bank's missions and the Government.
Bank staff carried out a significant amount of detailed preparatory work throughout
project preparation and appraisal, conducted a number of workshops on specific project
design issues and held a project launch seminar after loan effectiveness. Additional Bank
support to help develop the software components and sort out remaining implementation
issues was provided during post-appraisal and pre-negotiations missions. It is important
to note that the Bank fielded only four supervision missions during the four-year
implementation period, one of which was the mid-term review. Given the large scope of
the project and the complexity of the quality and management improvement programs,
these inputs were not sufficient to assist the Borrower to resolve project design and
implementation issues. There was some staff turnover during the entire implementation
period but this is not considered to have had an adverse effect on the project. The skills
mix of supervision missions was adequate although the participation of a financial analyst
would have been useful particularly to review project accounts and deal with the
continuing issue of late audits.
22.   Supervision missions visited most states in Peninsular Malaysia as well as Sabah
and Sarawak. These visits helped to identify and correct problems in the civil works
program (land acquisition in Sabah and Sarawak, site engineering and drainage, the use of
asbestos in building materials, and quality control of civil works) and provided support to
state and regional authorities with the quality improvement programs. Again, it must be
pointed out that the low frequency of missions somewhat limited the overall effectiveness
of this effort.

F.  BORROWER PERFORMANCE
24.   The Borrower's performance was generally satisfactory. The project coordination
unit within the MOE was familiar with Bank procedures and correctly carried out its
functions of managing the loan, coordinating the various project inputs, and maintaining
contact with the Bank. The accounting section within the project coordination unit was
not adequately staffed or equipped to process the large number of small contracts and
payments, keep the accounts up-to-date and submit audit reports on time. MOE staff
responsible for implementing the various project components carried out their tasks
competently and efficiently. However, costly delays in resolving tax issues and payment
conditions in consultant contracts for the EMIS, PIER and staff development programs
delayed implementation of these programs and had a negative effect on the project's
outcomes. With the exception of slow submittal of annual audits, the Government had a
satisfactory compliance with all loan covenants.
G.   ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
25.   Project outcomes are considered satisfactory. The objective of capacity expansion
in both primary and secondary education and the provision of teacher housing and student
accommodation was achieved or exceeded. With respect to quality improvements, the
teacher training and curriculum development programs were successfully executed which
helped improve student performance, particularly in secondary mathematics and science.
The PIER program and the EMIS are incomplete but prospects for their eventual
completion are good. Given the Government's strong commitment to establishing a high-
quality education system, prospects for sustaining project achievements are considered
good.
26.   Original project design included the possibility of Bank financing of the next
time-slice (1977-2000) of the Government's core investment program for primary and
secondary education under a follow-up operation. In late 1996, however, the Government
decided not to pursue this option as it had decided to reduce its borrowing for the social
sectors. The Bank is, therefore, not planning a follow-up project in primary and
secondary education.
H.   KEY LESSONS LEARNED
27.  In this sector investment operation, there was too much emphasis placed on
achieving fast disbursements for civil works. An early agreement (within the first year of
project implementation) to reallocate funds from "software categories" to the civil works
category may have added to the problem in that it de-emphasized the importance of the
quality improvement components (i.e., staff development, instructional methods/materials
development, management development, etc.) of the project.
28.   There is also a risk that the Bank will overestimate the Government's commitment
and its implementation capacity when overly complex components and subcomponents



9
are planned in projects. This situation often results in wasted resources and false
expectations by both the Bank and the Government.
29.   Although the Bank's supervision effort was substantial during project start-up, it
was not sufficiently frequent during the subsequent years (total of four missions in four
years). This led to a significant lack of Bank input during the implementation of the
complicated quality improvement components of the operation.
30.   Delayed submissions of audit reports, a persistent problem  that was raised
repeatedly by the Bank, and in the OED audit reports for the two previous education
sector projects, can be traced back to inadequacies in the Government's decentralized
accounting system. It would be helpful to recommend to Government to address this
problem in a more general way as it is likely to affect all future investment operations in
the sector.

Third Primary and Secondary Education Sector Project
(Loan 3536-MA)
Project Completion Mission
(January 26-31, 1997)
Aide-Memoire
12.   A World Bank mission composed of Messrs. Robert L. McGough (Senior Technical
Educator) and William D. Cooper (Education Specialist, Consultant) visited Malaysia from
January 26 to February 1, 1997, to conduct a final review of the recently completed Primary and
Secondary Education Sector Project (Loan 3536-MA) and to collect the necessary information
for the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR). During the mission, the
MOE provided final progress reports for each project component and submitted statistical data to
update the project's performance indicators. The mission would like to take this opportunity to
express its appreciation to the MOE staff involved in the ICR process for their hospitality and for
their contribution to the work of the mission.
13.   The mission's preliminary assessment of the project's overall performance is excellent.
In summary, the mission notes that (i) the education sector policy objectives for the 1993-96
period of improving access to and the quality of primary and secondary education have been met,
as confirmed by the project's performance indicators; (ii) the primary and secondary school
construction program financed by the loan has exceeded the project's initial targets by about 40
percent, with a corresponding increase in disbursements under the civil works category of the
loan; (iii) the teacher training component and the staff development program have been
successfully implemented, exceeding their initial targets, while remaining within the financial
envelopes; (iv) the Program for Innovation, Excellence and Research (PIER) has been fully
implemented, with mostly satisfactory results; (v) the Education Management Information
System (EMIS) component only partially achieved its objectives due to delays in starting it up,
but a solid foundation has been laid to establish the system over the next year or two.
14.   The Govemment has complied with the covenants in the Loan Agreement, with the
exception of the covenant relating to the submission of financial audits of the project accounts (as
noted in paragraph 5 below). Agreed accounting procedures with respect to Statements of
Expenditures (SOEs) have been correctly observed. Project Management has been effective.
15.   The project was closed on December 31, 1996, on schedule. The loan account will be
kept open until April 30,1997, to allow final disbursements for goods and/or services delivered
prior to the closing date. As of January 14, 1997, approximately US$8.9 million remains
undisbursed, mainly in categories 4 (books and educational materials - 3.1 million), 5 (specialists
services and overseas fellowships - 5.0 million), and 7 (local training - 0.5 million). Recognizing
the importance of the qualitative aspects supported by these funding categories, the mission
recommends that the remaining funds be disbursed, as much as possible, against these software



processed before April 30, 1997 for reimbursement under the loan, the mission recommends that
Government confirm to the Bank that all goods and services under categories 4, 5 and 7 of the
loan agreement have been procured as specified, along with a request to reallocate any remaining
loan funds to other categories for which reimbursements can be claimed, such as civil works or
equipment.
16.   The mission would like to draw the Government's attention to the important delays in the
submission of financial audits of project accounts to the World Bank, which are due within six
months after the end of each fiscal year. Specifically, the FY95 audit was due on June 30, 1996,
but has not yet been submitted to the Bank, possibly due to work overload and/or administrative
delays in preparing the project's financial statements. It was agreed with DSD that the FY95
financial statements will be submitted to the Auditor General's office no later than February 15,
1997, with a recommendation that the audit report be issued no later than March 31, 1997. In
order to close the books on this loan, the mission recalls that the FY96 audit is due by June 30,
1997.
17.   The general findings summarized in this aide-memoire will be reflected in the draft ICR,
to be completed upon the mission's return to Washington. This draft will be submitted to
Government for comment by March 31, 1997. The mission suggests that the Government's
contribution to the ICR--its evaluation of project performance (not exceeding ten pages)--be
submitted to the Bank for comment by March 31, 1997, so that it can be finalized and annexed to
the Bank's portion of the document. This timetable is necessary to meet the June 30, 1997
deadline for submission of the ICR to the Bank's Executive Directors.

PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
PROJECT OBJECTIVES AiND SCOPE
1.1   Objectives
The Government and the Bank on 16 December, 1992 agreed on a Loan Agreement
to undertake the implementation of various education programs under the Third
Primary and Secondarv Education Sector Project (Project). The Project is to support
the implementation of a broader policy in promoting and improving the achievement
of education in Malaysia under the Sixth Malaysia Plan. The objectives of the
Project are to improve the quality of, and increase access to, primary and secondary
education, and to strengthen the efficiency of educational management. To realise
these objectives, programs undertaken were implemented through Sub-Projects of
three investment components, namely; quality and excellence in education, equitable
access to quality education, and efficiency of educational management. Loan proceed
amounting up to US 141 million is disbursed through eight categories, namely, i) civil
works, ii) equipment, iii) furniture, iv) books and materials, v) specialist services and
overseas fellowships and training, vi) local fellowships and training, vii) research
studies and grants, and viii) management and administration.
1.2   Scope and Description
The Project financed a substantial proportion of MOE's education programs covering
curricula, physical facilities, educational resources, teacher training and staff
development. Given the magnitude of the education blueprint under the Sixth Plan,
the Bank and the Government came into agreement on (a) a core program of
investments to be supported by the Bank Loan and (b) a phased implementation
totalling seven years in two time-slices. The bank financing of the Project under the
first time-slice is from January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1996. Negotiation for
the second time-slice would follow at the end of the first-slice. Programs undertaken
through the three Sub-Project investment components during the first time-slice as in
1



the Loan Agreement and the Staff Appraisal Report are as follows:
1.2.1  Sub-Project I: Quality Improvement
Sub-Project I aims to promote quality and excellence in the teaching and
learning process by strengthening the teacher training system and expanding
teacher training capacity for primary and secondary school teachers. The Sub-
Project would provide about 3,000 additional places for teacher training. It
also supports curriculum  implementation  through improvement in the
quality, availability and utilisation of education resources. This in particular is
achieved through, a) the provision of video, television, radio and radio-
cassette equipment to schools, b) the provision of library materials, including
books and related library and science equipment to schools c) the production
and distribution of multi-media kits for classroom use and self-paced learning
modules for teacher training and for students, d) the enhancement of the
resource centres network by the rehabilitation of four existing state resource
centres. Sub-Project I also concentrates on developing and implementing a
program to support innovation, excellence and research (PIER). The program
includes research, studies, and pilot-operations (including pilot operations on
early childhood development and special education), with an emphasis on
mathematics  and  science, small rural schools and communications
technology.
1.2.2  Sub-Project II: Increase of Educational Access
Programs designed and implemented under Sub-Project II intend to expand
equitable access to quality education by: a) rehabilitating, constructing,
equipping and furnishing as appropriate, of approximately 4,400 primary
and 3,200 secondary school classrooms, b) providing housing for about
3,000 teachers, and c) providing boarding facilities for 20,000 primary and
secondary school students from rural areas. This Sub-Project would also
finance operational visits, training, experimentation under PIER, and limited
equipment and civil works for early childhood development and special
education.
1.2.3  Sub-Project HI: Strengthening of Educational Management
The focus of Sub-Project III is on improving the efficiency of sectoral and
project management by: a) implementing a staff development program that
includes local and overseas training for about 1,000 senior and middle-level
educational managers and professionals, b) providing specialist services and
the carrying out of studies related to education, c) upgrading the education
management information system through training and the provision of
equipment and software, and d) carrying out supervision of the programs
undertaken at the state and district levels.

2     ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The period 1993-1996 observed remarkable efforts by the various implementation divisions
to realise the objectives of the Project. The firm commitrnent of the concerned divisions and
efforts of the MOE personnel to programs undertaken through the three Sub-Projects have
apparently succeeded in promoting quality and excellence, providing access and equity and
managerial efficiency in education. Some programs have even exceeded the initial targets.
However, some were revised to meet current needs, while others, especially those related to
technical assistant (TA) and specialist services involving overseas consultant were modified
to meet time constraints because of delays in contractual undertakings. Detailed below are
the performances of Sub-Projects according to programs undertaken in achieving the set
objectives.
2.1   Sub-Project I: Quality Improvement
2.1.1  Rationalisation and expansion of teacher training capacity for primary
and secondarv school teachers by provision of about 3,000 additional
places for teacher training.
In its effort to raise the standard of educational delivery system of primary
and secondary education, the MOE has tremendously increased the capacity
of teacher training colleges within the 1993 - 1996 period. This was possible
with the expansion of 2 teacher training colleges (TTCs); i.e in Besut and
Kangar. Total enrolment at the teacher training colleges in base year 1990
was 23,006, and by the closing of the Project (1996) the enrolment was
46,019. Indicating a 100 per cent increase, which far exceeded the initial
target of 10 per cent increment. The MOE has also upgraded the TTCs
program from certificate level to diploma level, commencing 1996. This
upgrading will apparently, improve the overall quality of teachers trained at
the TTCs.
2.1.2  Provision of video, television, radio and radio-cassette equipment to
primary and secondary schools.
The MOE developed a standard media equipment inventory and a standard
media equipment maintenance guideline for primary and secondary schools.
The mechanisms are currently in use. The Media Equipment Inventory Study
and Media Utilisation Study undertaken and completed in June 1994 by the
Universiti Sains Malaysia were the reference in developing both the
mechanisms.
2.1.3  Production and distribution of multi-media kits for classroom use and
self-paced learning modules for teacher training and students.
All the thirty-eight training manuals developed are currently in use at the
T7Cs. These self-paced training modules were developed by MOE officers
3



and lecturers from the TTCs who participated in the TED's overseas
fellowship and local training courses. By the end of 1996, local training
courses mounted by TED using the multiplier effect strategy has made it
possible for 2,130 participants to utilise the thirty-eight training modules.
Altogether 298 training modules and self-paced learning modules in
mathematics. science and English language for primary and secondary
schools were developed under the PIER. The teaching and learning modules
have been disseminated to the all State Education Departments (SED),
District Education Offices (DEO), State Education Resource Centres
(SERCs), Teacher Activity Centres (TACs) and schools. They are currently in
use.
2.r.4  Enhancement of the resource centres network by the rehabilitation of
four existing state resource centres.
A study by the USM on the organisation and management of the four SERCs
has identified a need for an increase in staff numbers as well as physical
development to provide more space and additional facilities to the SERCs.
The study also disclosed that the proposed plan for the upgrading of physical
facilities for the four existing SERCs as not one that is over designed. As
such, the MOE will proceed with the plan. Works on the upgrading are
expected to be ready by 1997. Funding is done locally under the Seventh
Malaysia Plan. In line with recommendation from the study, the Government
has approved the placement of additional staff at the SERCs and the TACs.
2.1.5  Provision of library materials, including books and related library
science equipment to schools.
The distributions of selected books to Project and non-Project schools have
been undertaken. Two hundred and nineteen primary schools and 149
secondary schools are involved in the project. Most of the schools have
received the books.
2.1.6  Implementation of a program of research, studies, and pilot-operations
(including pilot operations on early childhood development and special
education), with an emphasis on mathematics and science, small rural
schools, communications technology, and educational research.
The program for innovation, excellence and research (PIER) has been
successfully implemented even though initial progress was somewhat slow.
The implementation of the program improved tremendously in 1995. This
was after contract signing for technical assistant (TA) with the International
Development Program (IDP) of the Australian Universities and Colleges was
4



undertaken. The delay in undertaking the contract with the IDP was related to
issues raised by the Federal Treasury regarding taxes and guarantee of
advance payments. Co-operation of consultants from IDP, co-ordinators and
implementers of PIER in 1996, further improved PIER, especially in ensuring
its success and in setting the foundations for sustainability and continuity of
PIER. The IDP has effectively supported the PIER in the development of
various training modules and professional development programs. It has also
made possible the undertaking of 22 education researches including issues on
multi-grade teaching in small and isolated schools and special education.
These studies were carried out by the EPRD and the local universities. PIER
with the TA from the IDP has also implemented about 20 courses for 600
education officers and teachers in developing knowledge and skill required to
develop and conduct action research projects. IDP has also assisted in the
implementation of over 500 small-scale action research projects at school
level.
PIER has also been successful in exploring alternative approaches in the
delivery system through the introduction of a pilot program in distance
education (DE). Through the DE program that is currently being piloted in 12
TTCs, primarv  school classroom  teachers are able to upgrade their
professional qualification and developed further skills in the teaching of
mathematics and science.
2.2   Sub-Project II: Increase of Educational Access
2.2.1  Rehabilitation, construction, equipping and furnishing as appropriate of
approximately 4,400 primary and 3,200 secondary school classroom and
provision of housing for about 3,000 teachers and provision of boarding
facilities for 20,000 primary and secondary school students from rural
areas.
The Project provides fund to construct, rehabilitate and equip 4,420 primary
and 3,132 secondary school classrooms, 3,000 housing units for teachers and
20,000 boarding facilities for rural school students. However, the MOE
found it necessary to revise the initial SAR target. The revision involves an
additional 3,770 primary and 1,367 secondary school classrooms, 1,415
housing units for teachers and reduction of 6,910 boarding facilities for rural
school students. Table 1 of Part I1: Statistical Information shows the revision.
By the closing of the loan agreement, the primary and secondary school
construction programs as well as the teacher housing program have exceeded
the initial SAR  target.  The primary school  and secondary school
construction programs and the teacher housing prograrn exceeded by 65 per
cent, 4 per cent and 11 % respectively. However, the provision of boarding
for rural primary and secondary students did not meet the initial SAR target
The program fell short by 63 per cent. The progress of physical development
5



projects undertaken for Special Education is slow. Out of the 11 projects
planned, three have been completed, seven are under construction and one is
in the planning stage. All these projects are financed locally under the
Seventh Malaysia Plan.
On the whole, the undertaking of this Sub-Project has resulted in 40 per cent
increase in disbursements under the civil works category. Table 2 of Part II:
Statistical Information shows the detail of Sub-Projects by states.
2.3   Sub-Project III: Strengthening of Education Management
2.3.1  Implementation of a staff development program (SDP), for about 1,000
senior and middle-level education managers and professionals through
local and  overseas training, provision  of specialist services and
conducting studies in education.
The SDP has been successfully implemented and has exceeded its initial
target of training 1,000 senior and middle-level educational managers and
professionals through local and overseas courses. The program was able to
expose some 871 education officers, comprising master teachers, head
teachers and principals, district education officers and education planners and
researchers in various fields of specialisation including management and
administration through short and long term courses abroad. In addition, 1,136
officers including classroom teachers were trained under in-country courses.
Table 3 of Part II: Statistical Information shows the detail of SDP target and
actual number of participants by Sub-programs.
2.3.2  Upgrading of the educational management information system through
training, the provision of specialist services, studies and the provision of
equipment and software.
The upgrading of the education management information system (EMIS) has
been moderate. This is because the starting up of the program with overseas
consultant was delayed due to red-tape and bureaucracies. Contractual
agreement for TA from Harvard Institute for Intemational Development
(HIID) was only signed in 1995. Because of the delay the program has been
compressed from three years into one year and seven months. Initial plans
have to be modified to suit the time constraint. However, upon signing the
agreement with the HIID, needs assessment of EMIS was conducted through
discussions with 250 MOE officers and a blueprint for EMIS was developed.
The blueprint is to be implemented over the next year or two. The co-
operation between the HIID and MOE has also made possible the
development of an EMIS application which will be tested in the first half of
1997 before its full implementation in the same year. The implementation of
6



both the EMIS blueprint and application will be funded locally under the
Seventh Malaysia Plan period.
The HIID, TA has also made possible the undertaking of five overseas
training courses with focus on policy analysis, policy briefs, economics of
education and Geographic Information Service (GIS) for 43 MOE personnel,
and one overseas attachment program at HIID for four MOE personnel.
Some MOE officers were also trained in Micro Soft project by the HIID TA.
Apart from training programs undertaken with the HIID, the MOE has also
mounted overseas training program with the Asian Institute of Technology
(AIT), Bangkok and local training programs with Universiti Teknologi
Malaysia (UTM) and the Institute of National Administration (INTAN).
Altogether 180 MOE personnel were trained at these institutions. The focus
of the training programs were on ORACLE, SAS, budgeting, database
management and GIS.
In addition to the above activities, EMIS also funded three studies carried
out by the MOE and other government agencies with the co-operation of the
HIID and five studies carried out by various divisions of the MOE
with the co-operation of the Stanford University.
2.3.3  Supervision of activities undertaken at the state and district levels,
including the provision of specialist services, equipment and conducting
studies.
Soft-core programs undertaken at state and district levels are under the
management of PIER, SDP and TED. Thus, supervisions of the programs,
namely, specialist services, action research, teaching and learning modules
development, and training courses at these two levels are done through
monitoring bodies established within the respective divisions at the MOE.
By the closing of the Project, most prograrns at these two levels were
successfully implemented.
The provision of equipment to schools is through private agencies contracted
by the DSD through the tender system. Accordingly, deliveries of the
equipment to schools were made known to the state and district education
offices.
3   IMPLEMENTATION RECORD
3.1   MOE Performance
The implementation progress at the beginning of the loan agreement was somewhat
slow. However, constant monitoring of Sub-Projects through the Project Co-
ordination Committee (PCC) which convened once in two months has helped to
7



speed up progress. The PCC, chaired jointly by the Deputy Secretary General and the
Deputy Director General of Education assisted by a Secretariat at the Educational
Planning and Research Division (EPRD) was able to address problems faced by
implementers.  The main players in overseeing the implementation  of the
Sub-Projects are the Development and Supply Division (DSD), Educational Planning
and Research Division (EPRD), Teacher Education Division (TED), School
Division (SD) and Educational Technology Division (ETD). Subsequently, these
divisions set up co-ordination sub-committees to monitor the progress of programs
undertaken at the various divisions of the MOE, and at the state and district levels.
The implementers and participants at all levels and in all investment components
have fully utilised and benefited from all sources of expertise from the Project.
Officers who participated  in the various training programs have contributed
significantly  towards disseminating and sharing of knowledge, skills and
experiences with other education officers through the multiplier effect strategy.
3.2   Bank Performance
Initially, the Bank review mission and MOE were constantly in disagreement
regarding strategies in addressing issues in enhancing education achievements in
Malaysia. This was because first-time Bank representatives were not clear of the
education system in Malaysia. The Bank ought to focus on projects funded under the
Bank Loan and not intervene in non related policy matters. Nonetheless, yearly
supervision visits by the review mission were received accordingly and yearly
progress reports of the Project were handed to the mission head. Towards the closing
of the loan agreement, the Bank and the MOE were more in accord. The Bank was
more supportive and approving towards MOE's proposed modification to the initial
SAR targets and reallocation of Loan proceeds.
The MOE acknowledges the advantages of the yearly supervisions/meetings with the
review mission. To some extent, these have aided in building better understanding
between the Bank and the MOE.
4     MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
- The MOE was persistent and committed in implementing the various education programs
under the Project. Nevertheless implementation snags occurred and to some extent have
affected performance. Summarised below are the main problems encountered in undertaking
the Project.
4.1   A number of project related to Sub-Project II, under the civil works component
especially in Sabah and Sarawak were not completed within schedule. However, the
projects will be continued using local funds. The problems were related to the
acquisition of land, site and location of land, tender procedures, and inefficient
building contractors.
8



4.2   Late undertaking of some programs has affected the achievement of the Project
objectives as initially warranted. Some programs have to be modified to meet time
constraint. Delay of up to about two years, namely, in contracting consultant for TA
has resulted in under utilisation of their experience and expertise and escalated cost
over the years. Despite the delay, the programs did show splendid attainment. The
MOE commends the commitment given by those involved.
4.3   The reorganisation of the MOE in 1995 had resulted in the reassignment of special
education program managed by the SD to a newly established division at the MOE.
The change has affected the pace of the program implementation. This was because
officers assigned to continue the program has to undergo a learning period to
familiarise themselves with the program. Similarly, the movement of program
managers/desk officers from one division/level to another within the MOE or other
government agencies has the same effect.
4.4   The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) succeeded in implementing the physical
investment components. However, the management load demanded by the
complexity and scale of both the physical and soft-core investments of the Project
has marred the disbursement performance of the latter, slowed down the processing
of account, and delayed the submission of audits to the Bank. Confusion over
disbursement procedure by implementation agencies aggravated the problem. There
were times when the audit report could not be submitted to the Bank on time.
4.5   Some program expenditures could not be reimbursed because implementers failed to
adhere standing reimbursement procedures. This has resulted in local funding of the
concemed program and reallocation of its fund to other categories. Thus, presenting
low performance and under utilisation of allocation of the concerned category. This
is especially true of soft-core investment programs.
S     PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
5.1   The Third Primary and Secondary Education Sector Project has been successful in
complementing the building of a solid basic foundation for a high quality education
and a more effective delivery system to meet the demand and need of the twenty-first
century. The MOE will continue to build on the success of previous Projects with the
expansion and upgrading of physical facilities at all levels of education, particularly
to cater for the increase in enrolment and to create a more conducive learning and
teaching environment. To address the effectiveness of the delivery system, the MOE
will proceed to undertake staff development program that would enable the training
of teachers and personnel to enhance their skills and knowledge.
5.2   Sub-Projects financed under the Third Loan would continue through the Seventh
Malaysia Plan. The Government support is evident by funding already secured for
undertaking programs that would continue to promote the three investment
components namely; quality and excellence in education, equitable access to quality
education, and efficiency of education management. The Seventh Plan allocates 15.4
9



5.3   per cent of total projected expenditures on public development to the education and
training sector (RM10.1 billion), a 2.4 per cent increase over the Sixth Plan. The
allocation for primary and secondary general education is RM3.84 billion or 37.6 per
cent of the total allocation for the education and training sector. As such, the MOE
sees no cause in negotiating for the second-time slice.
6     LESSONS LEARNED
In view of the MOE's concern over effective education management in relation to successful
implementation of education programs, the following lessons learned from undertaking the
Project have to be considered and taken into account for future endeavour.
6.1   The Project undertaken by the MOE have to be studied on its complexity compared
to capacity of quantitative staffing and infrastructure to implement the Project. The
quantum of the project should be reviewed from time to time.
6.2   Officers involved in  the Project  must be able to conceptualise the standing
procedure related to the Project, especially those concerning reimbursement of
expenditures. This will enhance the process of disbursement and prevents high
commitment charges.
6.3   To be cost effective the MOE has to evaluate all programs undertaken before
decisions are made regarding its future maintenance and possible extension. To
ensure sustainability of programs the MOE would have to build a chain of network
between the various central agencies and within the MOE to co-operate in the
implementation of continued education programs. All involved must be able to claim
ownership and be cornmitted to the program.
6.4   All programs must have an in-built evaluation system  so that evaluation can be
done concurrently. Thus, effective mechanisms have to be developed. Apart from
this, all outputs, such as, teaching and learning materials and modules already
developed and currently in use have to be periodically reviewed and evaluated.
Accordingly, the contents have to be upgraded according to needs and latest
development in the related areas.
6.5   Extensive procedures to secure foreign TA have to be reduced so that contractual
undertaking could be closed at the beginning of Project. Delays in such undertaking
would cause under utilisation of contracted expertise.
