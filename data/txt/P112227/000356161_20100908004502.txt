                                   support measured by social assistance benefits rising with
                                   inflation and at least 2000 beneficiaries in welfare-to-work
                                   programs by 2012.

Program Development                The Program aims to support the Government of Kosovo in
Objective(s) and Contribution to   (i) maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework while
CAS                                increasing the transparency, accountability, and
                                   management of public expenditures, and (ii) laying the
                                   institutional and legislative foundations Kosovo needs for
                                   sustainable employment and growth. This Program is the
                                   centerpiece of the Interim Strategy which was presented to
                                   the World Bank Board in February 2010.

Risks and Risk Mitigation          There are significant risks associated with the
                                   implementation of the Program, including (i) medium-term
                                   macroeconomic instability, (ii) spillover effects of the

 PROPOSED FIRST SUSTAINABLE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION

                                       REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO


                                       I.      INTRODUCTION


1.      Kosovo today faces important challenges and risks as it moves forward with institution
building in a post-conflict environment. Kosovo declared its independence on February 17, 2008,
and, to date, has been recognized by less than a third of the world's countries. The country faces
substantial challenges similar to those experienced by other fragile states. Policymakers also have to
balance the immediate demands and expectations coming from their constituencies with the need to
maintain fiscal prudence and stability and to create a policy and institutional setting conducive to
medium and long term growth. In addition, Kosovo is faced with the difficult task of building an
inclusive development process that overcomes the ethnic divisions still prevalent in the post-conflict
environment with the risk of tensions still high. The substantial, albeit evolving, international presence
is reducing these risks with the NATO-led peace-keeping force, the International Civilian Office, the
United Nations Interim Administration (UNMIK), and EULEX, the EU-led status-neutral mission, all
having played ­ and continuing to play ­ important roles.

2.       At the heart of Kosovo's ability to achieve inclusive development and social stability lies
the attainment of employment-generating economic growth.                 Today, only three out of ten
Kosovans of working age are employed ­ by far the lowest employment rate in Europe. This is a
result of extremely low levels of labor force participation at 53 percent of the working age population,
the lowest in Europe, coupled with an extremely high rate of unemployment, estimated at about 45%.
Employment creation will be the main factor in the reduction of poverty which affects over 40 percent
of the population: World Bank staff analysis shows that a 10 percent reduction in the prevailing
unemployment rate would be associated with a 6 percent reduction in poverty. As this suggests,
bringing people into gainful employment is at the heart of Kosovo's efforts to achieve social, political
and economic stability and thereby achieve medium- and long-term development success.

3.      Laying the foundation for employment generation in the medium-term will first and
foremost require macroeconomic stability, which came under threat through fiscal loosening in
2009. Creating jobs through private-sector led growth will take time but the Government is now
laying the foundations for such job creation to be possible in the future. Macroeconomic stability will
be a necessary condition for sustained growth to materialize. With the Euro as currency and anchor,
fiscal policy assumes a pivotal role for achieving macro-economic stability in Kosovo. Up until
independence Kosovo had managed to achieve fiscal surpluses and accumulate a fiscal reserve equal to
12 percent of GDP. In 2009, however, consolidated public expenditures are estimated to have
increased by 23 percent, reflecting both initial plans and additional spending decisions at mid-year.
The increase in spending was largely concentrated in capital expenditures (by 26 percent), in
unplanned energy subsidies (by 5 percent), and in public sector wage increases (by 19 percent). As a
consequence, Kosovo's primary balance turned from a balanced budget in 2008 to a deficit of 6
percent of GDP in 2009. A one-off dividend from the publicly-owned telecom company of 5.2 percent
of GDP helped finance this deficit, with the remaining deficit financed by a drawdown in previously
accumulated bank balances.




                                                    1
4.       Although the Parliament approved a sound budget for 2010 it was soon followed by the
announcement of new spending initiatives. Specifically, in the first half of 2010 the authorities
announced new policies that had a significant fiscal impact and increased the overall deficit. The
largest, in terms of fiscal impact, was a contract to develop a highway to Albania which was signed in
April and was estimated to cost at least 24 percent of 2010 GDP over the four year implementation
period. Other initiatives such as expansion of war-related benefits, and pension increases, were also
announced, but to be implemented as of 2011 or later.

5.      To achieve fiscal stabilization, the authorities agreed on a Stand-By Arrangement with
the IMF which was approved by the IMF Board on July 21, 2010. The 18-month Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) aims to restore fiscal stability through a mid-year budget review that will
incorporate the new policy initiatives into the budget, identify financing sources and put spending caps
on the 2011 budget to ensure medium-term fiscal stability.

6.       The proposed programmatic Sustainable Employment Development Policy Program
(SEDPP) would support the Government of Kosovo's multi-year policy framework to strengthen
fiscal management and create the foundations for generating sustainable employment. The
proposed SEDPP would support the Government of Kosovo to (i) maintain a stable macroeconomic
framework while increasing the transparency, accountability, and management of public expenditures,
and (ii) lay the institutional and legislative foundations it needs for sustainable employment and
growth. The first of three operations would support specific actions taken to strengthen fiscal
management, improve the investment climate, and develop the institutions needed for an employment-
generating growth process. The Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey from 2009
suggests a number of areas where businesses face significant obstacles, and the program will set the
institutional foundations for tackling the elements which can be addressed through policy and
institutional change. The second and third operations would support further actions to improve fiscal
management as well as the implementation of both the public financial management action plan and
employment strategy that have been developed over the past months.           The Program forms the
centerpiece of the IDA Interim Strategy Note which was presented to the World Bank Board in
February 2010.

7.       This First Sustainable Employment Development Policy Operation (SEDPO1) would
support Government actions that have improved fiscal management and have laid the
foundation for an employment-generating growth process. Among the actions supported by the
proposed SEDPO1 are the (i) completion of the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) self-assessment in 2009 and the adoption of an action plan to improve Kosovo's Public
Financial Management (PFM) system; (ii) the enactment of a new Civil Service Law which creates
uniform pay and grading structures for the public services and represents a major step toward creating
a firm basis for the exercise of management and fiscal controls; (iii) the completion and adoption of a
cross-sectoral Employment Strategy, a first for Kosovo, and the translation of the financeable elements
of the strategy into the 2010 budget; (iv) a number of actions that lay the foundation for spurring
private investment into the country, including a new Leasing Law which will allow credit-constrained
firms to gain access to machinery and equipment; (v) an accreditation review of the higher education
institutions made by the Kosovo Accreditation Agency which will contribute to improve the quality of
education and skills much needed for future private sector growth; and (vi) an increase in the budgeted
funds for social assistance and pensions as a crisis mitigation measure.

8.      At the Kosovo Donors' Conference in 2008, the Government requested that increasing
amounts of donor support be funneled through the budget after agreeing on broader budget
priorities with its international partners, allowing donor support to strengthen the credibility
and soundness of Kosovan institutions and encouraging donors to coalesce around the
Government's own priorities. The SEDPP is financed in large part as a grant from trust funds

                                                   2
established in 2008 and 2009 for the sole purpose of assisting the Government of Kosovo through
budget support plus some additional funding from the IDA Crisis Response Window. This would
allow Kosovan policymakers to move away from the previous patchwork of donor-financed technical
assistance. Donors agreed to coordinate and provide budget support which would support the building
of institutions during this critical stage in a fragile environment. The trust funds stem from past IBRD
surplus set aside to support Kosovo which served as seed money and to which eleven additional
donors1 have pledged. The IBRD surplus was set aside to support the proposed program for Kosovo
by a Bank Board decision taken on July 3, 2008 when Kosovo had not been a member of the Bank.
An additional IDA allocation of USD 7 million (SDR 4.3 million) is available to Kosovo through the
Crisis Response Window and is being added to SEDPO 1 as a Credit.

9.       The Program would support core structural reforms in Kosovo but with substantial
associated risks. There are substantial risks associated with the implementation of the Program as
there would be in any postconflict, fragile state, including (i) the dangers of falling into
macroeconomic instability, (ii) spillover effects of the global financial crisis, (iii) fragility of Kosovo's
governance and political structures as institutions of government are being developed, (iv) limited
capacity in program implementation given the limited experience, (v) delays in implementation of pay
and grading reform of core civil servants, and (vi) difficulties in maintaining a conducive framework
for employment generation given political demands for increased benefits. Improved public financial
management would help mitigate the macroeconomic risks, including those related to the financial
crisis, as well as contribute to improving the overall governance of public policies. Limited
implementation capacity will be strengthened through parallel technical assistance activities of the
World Bank and other donors. The programmatic approach would allow for flexibility to adapt to
implementation delays. IDA is also working with the authorities to provide public information on why
measures are being taken and on progress in achieving outcomes, which can help mitigate political
demands for counterproductive measures.

 DFID has informed the World Bank that it will not be able to contribute to the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for
SEDPP this financial year (to April 2011), but may be in a position to do so in subsequent years. Should its
future contributions fail to materialize, the second and third disbursements for SEDPP will by necessity have to
be reduced by up to 25%. At the time of Board submission, the EC has also not signed an Administration
Agreement with IDA for its pledged contribution, although the Administration Agreement is expected to be
completed shortly.

                                     II.      COUNTRY CONTEXT


A.        POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT


10.      Since its declaration of independence on February 17, 2008, Kosovo has been recognized
by 69 countries and became a member of the IMF and the World Bank Group in June 2009.
Kosovo has also been granted the status of potential candidate by the status-neutral European Union
(EU). A more detailed discussion of the political environment can be found in the Interim Strategy
Note presented to the Bank Board on February 4, 2010.2 On July 23, 2010, the International Court of
Justice in The Hague found that Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence had not violated
international law.

11.     In the longer-term, Kosovo is looking to deepen its integration with the EU and an
agreed mechanism for monitoring progress towards this goal has already been established. While
the mechanism to advance toward integration for most Western Balkan countries is the EU's
Stabilization and Association Process (SAP), a parallel mechanism -- the SAP Tracking Mechanism
(STM), established in 2002 ­ has been created for Kosovo, taking into account its disputed status.
Between 2002 and 2006, progress towards integration was monitored regularly via an annual report.
In 2006, Kosovo adopted a European Partnership Action Plan designed to meet the requirements of the
STM and which has also been updated annually. At the end of 2009, the European Commission
published a strategy proposal that defined in more detail the future relationship between the EU and
Kosovo. The Commission's proposals are due to progress in the area of visas, trade, institutional and
policy dialogue, including macro-economic dialogue and the use of financial assistance. The EU's
General Affairs and External Relations Council of December 2010 supported the proposal of the
Commission. The STM has been upgraded to the Stabilization and Association Process dialogue (SAP
dialogue) implemented as from early 2010.



B.        RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN KOSOVO


12.     Kosovo's economic growth has been solid since the end of the conflict. Gross domestic
product (GDP) growth was double-digit in 2000-2001, reflecting the massive donor-funded
reconstruction effort after the end of the conflict in 1999. Growth afterwards was moderate, and driven
by continued donor financing, remittances, and a recovery in economic activity. Between 2005 and
2007, growth averaged around 4 percent and was driven by a strong rise in investment and
consumption; exports also rose rapidly but from a very low starting base of 5 percent of GDP, so their
contribution was more modest.

13.      The global economic crisis caused growth to slow down. Growth peaked at 5.5 percent in
2008, just before the spill-over effects of the global crisis began to be felt in the region. In 2009,
Kosovo suffered declines in exports, foreign investment and remittances as a result of the global crisis,
although the overall impact of the crisis has been less striking than elsewhere in the region due to the
limited international integration of Kosovo's economy. Exports fell by about 20 percent year-on-year,
mostly due to a decline in metal prices. Foreign investment flows fell by over 20%, and remittances,
the single largest inflow category in the balance of payments, declined by about 10 percent. Output

                                                      4
growth slowed moderately to about 4 percent due to the expansionary fiscal policy: public spending
rose by 5.6 percentage points in 2009, reaching 30.3 percent of GDP.

14.     The spill-over effects on Kosovo's banking sector were very limited even though local
banks are largely foreign-owned. The difficulties of foreign parent banks have not impacted local
banking as the local market mostly relies on domestic financing. The impact on the banking sector has
also been contained by measures of the central bank to prevent a more substantial transfer of funds
from local to parent banks and to ensure that the loan to deposit ratio is kept at a prudent level.
However, the reduced external and domestic demand has led to a slight increase in non-performing
loans, which could lead to a further constraint in access to finance.

15.      Macroeconomic, in particular external, imbalances persist and pose risks to medium-
term macroeconomic stability. The use of the euro as legal tender, combined with generally
conservative fiscal policy up to 2008, helped keep inflation in check. In fact, inflation has been largely
driven by import price developments, and following the spike in 2008 due to rising food and metal
prices, it became negative in 2009. In the medium term, the IMF expects inflation to be moderate,
between 1.7 and 3.2 percent. External imbalances have not shown signs of improvement: the current
account deficit (CAD) reached 25 percent of GDP in 2009 according to the IMF. Official transfers
remain high, at about 6.4 percent of GDP in 2009.3 At the same time, a significant part of external
financial flows is not captured as balance of payments statistics remain weak. The "Errors and
Omissions" category has remained high over the past years, and was about 7 percent of GDP in 2009;
these unidentified inflows covered 37% of the 2009 CAD.

16.     Fiscal policy loosened in 2009 and 2010. Kosovo achieved early successes in fiscal policy,
including reforms in tax policy and administration and the introduction of new taxes and collection
methods that contributed to a fivefold increase in domestic revenues between 2000 and 2004.
However, deficiencies in fiscal policy and planning have become apparent in recent years. Unrealistic
planning and budget adjustments led to a primary surplus of 7 percent of GDP in 2007. The
subsequent easing of the government's cash position led the government to shift towards an
expansionary stance and the budget moved to a balance in 2008 and close to 6 percent of GDP deficit
in 2009 (not counting the one-off dividend of 5 percent of GDP from the telecom company).

17.     The worsening fiscal situation in 2009 was largely due to primary expenditure increases
for capital projects, subsidies to the energy company and a rise in public wages. Primary
expenditure rose by almost more than half in nominal terms between 2007 and 2009, while tax revenue
increased only marginally in terms of share to GDP. Capital expenditure and lending to Publicly
Owned Enterprises (POEs), such as the energy company, accounted for the bulk of the increase.
Capital expenditure rose from about  150 million in 2007 to some  400 million in 2009 as shown in
Table 1. Budgeted capital expenditures in the 2009 mid-year budget review were actually much higher
( 470 mil.). Subsidies and transfers have also increased significantly, primarily to cover the financing
gap of the publicly-owned energy company, Korporota Energjetike Kosoves (KEK). Wage
expenditures rose from 5.9 percent of GDP in 2008 to 7 percent of GDP in 2009 due to the increase in
wages of public workers in early 2009. These expenditures were partly in response to constituent
demand in the run-up to the 2009 municipal elections.

18.    The fiscal expansion in 2009 has revealed a number of structural weaknesses of Kosovo's
budget process. The fiscal deterioration in 2009 is partly due to lack of clarity on policy priorities and
loose management of expenditures. Overall budget ceilings were not always respected and the Kosovo

authorities did not adopt a budget rectification in line with new realities. In the mid-year budget review
of 2009, the government added  108 million on top of its initial budget even though execution
capacity had remained weak. Also, several legislative initiatives had been submitted to parliament
without proper costing of their fiscal impact.

19.      The fiscal expansion in 2009 was financed by one-off revenue sources which will not be
available on a sustained basis. The 6 percent primary deficit was financed with an extraordinary
dividend of 5.2 percent of GDP from the publicly-owned telecom company (from accumulated profits
over the last several years). The remaining deficit was financed from drawing down the cash account
reserve, which is expected to have been reduced to about  450 million (still a comfortable level). The
government expected to receive budget support in 2009 which would have contributed to deficit
financing but this did not materialize due to slower than expected progress in the discussions with the
IMF on a program (a precondition for disbursement of funds from the European Commission).

20.     The sustainability of fiscal balances continued to weaken in 2010. In December 2009, the
Parliament of Kosovo approved the 2010 budget which was endorsed by the IMF and signaled a move
towards fiscal stabilization. However, the budget process was undermined soon after the adoption of
the budget as the Government introduced several new policy initiatives which had not been included in
the budget, the biggest one being a highway project to Albania. Other initiatives, such as expansion of
war-related benefits and further increases in pensions were announced but with a delay in
implementation until 2011 or later. These policy initiatives were also not included in the Medium-term
Expenditure Framework 2011-13 which was endorsed by the Government in April 2010.

                                                    6
21.      The biggest risk to the fiscal position and medium-term fiscal sustainability came from
the highway project. In April 2010, the Government signed a contract to construct a highway to the
border with Albania, which the World Bank estimates to cost at least 24 percent of 2010 GDP over the
four year implementation period. During the preparation of the project the World Bank advised the
Kosovan authorities to introduce a transparent and open bidding approach in the contracting as well as
to design the project in line with expected traffic and budget limitations. However, not all of these
recommendations, which could have reduced the overall cost, were incorporated. The World Bank also
raised the issue of critical policy, legal and institutional frameworks that needed to be put in place to
address potential adverse environment and human impacts that could arise during the construction and
use of the motorway.          These suggestions are currently being considered by the Government.
Nevertheless, the authorities have reconciled the highway project within the macroeconomic
framework agreed with the IMF. The estimated cost of the project was revised upwards based on the
recommendations of the World Bank team; however, there is a considerable risk of further cost
escalation. To finance this expensive project, the authorities have agreed to constrain other
expenditures and to expand revenues in order to maintain fiscal stability.



C.      MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

22.     Growth is expected to be moderate in the near term. The IMF projects GDP growth to
increase to 4.6 percent in 2010 and accelerate further in 2011 and 2012 (Table 2). The acceleration of
growth is expected to come from the continued fiscal expansion as a result of the highway project, as
well as from a recovery in remittances and rising exports. Preliminary data for the first few months of
2010 show that both exports and remittances have picked up following the decline in 2009. Inflation is
expected to increase owing to higher import prices and increases in excise taxes, but to remain
moderate (below 3.5 percent). The CAD will remain high, partly given the large import content of the
highway construction.

23.      The Government has prepared the 2010 Mid-year Budget Review (MYBR). The MYBR,
prepared in accordance with the agreement reached with the IMF, incorporates the new policy
initiatives which the Government has decided to implement. These included the highway project, and
the increase in war-related invalid pensions. Increases in pensions and expansion of other war-related
benefits are planned to be implemented from 2011 onwards. The MYBR aims to limit the impact of
these initiatives on the deficit through a fiscal adjustment of 0.6 percent of GDP (excluding the
highway). The adjustment will involve both expenditure constraint and revenue measures, i.e.
increases in excise taxes on most excise goods. The overall deficit including the highway project is
expected to reach 3.4 percent of GDP, and is expected to be financed from the SBA disbursements,
bank reserves held by the Government, and donor grants from this operation and from the European
Commission.

24.      The 18-month SBA puts continued restraint on spending in 2011. The program will
require a lower share of current spending in GDP and a further restraint on non-highway capital
expenditures. The highway expenditures are expected to be covered by privatization receipts from the
telecom company which the Government expects to receive by the first half of 2011. No additional
borrowing beyond what is included in the proposed SEDPP program is envisaged for 2010 and 2011,
and bank balances are to be maintained at above 6 percent of GDP to safeguard financial sector
stability.

25.      The SBA not only minimizes some of the fiscal risks, but also involves structural reforms
in several areas. On fiscal policy, the SBA calls for reforms to broaden the tax base and improve
public financial management. It also aims to reduce fiscal risks by shoring up the financial position of
the electricity company, KEK. Finally, the program seeks strengthening of the financial system by
bringing the Central Bank Law up to international standards as well as by making improvements to the
banking law.

26.      Reforms of the energy sector will be the single biggest determinant of the macroeconomic
outlook in the medium to long-term. The sector continues to be a major drain on budgetary
resources, incurring fiscal costs of at least 3.5 percent of GDP in 2009 ( 45 million were allocated to
cover capital and operating costs in the energy sector, in addition to a loan of  100 million to KEK
which had not been fully disbursed). The World Bank Group, together with other donors, has been
working with the Government to address these energy sector issues. The success of fiscal adjustment
will hinge on KEK's reducing technical and commercial losses, improving revenue collection, and
allowing the regulator to approve cost-recovery tariffs. These activities will require governance
changes in KEK, and commitments to control electricity theft and enforce bill collection through better
policing and expeditious court trials. Improving KEK's operational and financial performance is
particularly important as fiscal resources have been substantially strained with the signing of the
highway contract. The delay of reforms and investment could have severe repercussions for economic
activity and for the budget.

27.      Kosovo had no public debt when it declared independence, but subsequently took
responsibility for an outstanding Federal Republic of Yugoslavia IBRD loan in the amount of
EUR 381.2 million. Kosovo began servicing this debt in September 2009. A multi-donor debt relief
trust fund managed by the World Bank has received contributions from the U.S. and the EU in the
amounts of USD 125 million and EUR 5 million respectively. In October 2009, the Government of
Kosovo prepaid one third of the outstanding IBRD loan using fully the funds available in the trust
fund, as well as additional resources from the budget which had been escrowed for debt service. This
has reduced the debt stock to 6.4 percent of GDP. An additional contribution of USD 25.7 million has

                                                   9
been received from the US and the Swiss, which would cover the debt service obligation in September
2010 and March 2011. Kosovo may also face other liabilities from debt undertaken by the former
Yugoslavia as the other descendant states have, but discussions on this topic with potential creditors,
including the Paris and London Clubs, have not yet begun.

28.      Despite the relatively low debt stock (6.4% of GDP), Kosovo's risk of debt distress is
moderate. A Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) for Kosovo was approved by the World Bank and
the IMF managements in December 2009, which was then updated by the IMF in the preparation of
the SBA. The DSA, which takes into consideration the potential additional liabilities arising from the
former Yugoslav debt, concludes that all debt indicators remain on a sustainable path, over the next
two decades, in the baseline fiscal and external scenarios. However, fiscal and external sustainability is
subject to prominent risks, which justifies a "moderate risk" classification. The public debt trajectory
becomes unsustainable in the case of a seemingly moderate but permanent increase in the primary
deficit. For example, a primary deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP over the DSA projection period would
put debt on an unsustainable path. This finding underscores the need for devising an effective fiscal
anchor that is consistent with a medium-term macro framework. Moreover, Kosovo's narrow export
base, and high dependence on remittances, magnifies the impact of external shocks. Debt-service to
export ratios are expected to be in the 15% range and rising until 2012. This underlines the importance
of far reaching structural reforms to improve competitiveness and enhance export sector performance.

29.     The uncertainties related to the debt stock, the external vulnerabilities and the
limitations to monetary policy call for prudent macroeconomic policies. Servicing the above-
mentioned contingent liabilities would also put additional pressure on the budget, when resources are
already limited. The Government has limited recourse to borrowing and cannot print money in order to
cover any short term liquidity shortfalls (though the public debt law which was adopted in January
2010 would enable the government and municipalities to issue securities). A possible slowdown in
foreign aid or remittances could quickly weaken imports which would reduce government revenues
through customs revenue (which accounts for almost two thirds of total tax revenues) and require the
Government to draw down its accumulated bank balances. Should there be liquidity shortages in the
banking sector; the economy also has no lender of last resort, again suggesting caution. Finally,
following the privatization of the telecom company, the Government will have no other sources for
substantial one-off revenues (the privatization of KEK Distribution is not expected to bring substantial
revenue given the poor financial position of the company).

30.     On balance, the World Bank finds that the macroeconomic framework in Kosovo is
adequate for the proposed budget support operation. The country is, however, in need of budget
financing on a grant basis, including from IDA. If the authorities stay on track with the fiscal
planning agreed with the IMF, the macroeconomic outlook is positive. Lack of progress on structural
reforms contains significant risks. This operation would support the authorities in continuing several
structural reforms, including those in public financial management.

D.      PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

31.     At the core of the reform agenda for Kosovo are measures to improve public financial
management which would contribute significantly to macro stability, growth, and employment
creation. The increase in fiscal expenditure in 2009 was directly linked to a large expansion in the
capital budget, unrealistically low assumptions about the need for subsidies to the energy company,
and an increase in public sector wages. Given that the only tool available to the authorities to maintain
macroeconomic stability is fiscal policy, it is crucial that public finances are well managed. While the
foundations for an effective public financial management system are now in place, the remaining
reform agenda includes: (i) strengthening medium-term fiscal and budgetary planning, (ii) improving

                                                   10
public procurement processes, and (iii) significantly strengthening payroll management, all of which
have added to the fiscal loosening experienced in 2009.

32.      In recent years, Kosovo has made some progress toward establishing a functioning
public financial management system, but still faces significant challenges. The current government
institutions of Kosovo started out as the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government in 2002 and
progressively assumed key public financial management (PFM) functions transferred from UNMIK
following the adoption of the UN Standards for Kosovo in late 2003. However, many of Kosovo's

33.      While substantial
improvements have occurred in several areas between 2007 and 2009, realistic multi-year
perspective planning and the effectiveness of payroll controls are the remaining two key reform
areas. Figure 2 shows the results of the PEFA Assessment for 2007 and 2009, showing improvement in most
indicators, but declines in the orderliness of the budgeting process and public access to fiscal information. In
both effectiveness of payroll controls and the multi-year perspective in planning and budget, the Government
had scored D+ in 2007. While the 2009 score for multi-year budgeting increased to a C, effective payroll
controls remained at a D+. In most other areas, there has been substantial improvement as shown in Figure 1.

Budget Preparation and Execution

34.     Despite recent improvements, medium-term fiscal and budgetary planning remains the
core development area for the PFM system in Kosovo. While the Law on Public Financial
Management and Accountability refers to a three-year budget perspective, the fiscal perspective has de
facto been annual, as the preparation of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the
annual budget process has not been adequately coordinated, while sectoral strategies are not always
adequately costed and reflected in the MTEF. Recent efforts to improve the credibility of fiscal
projections and the synchronization of the MTEF and annual budget processes seem to be gradually
bringing results in terms of a better coordinated budget preparation process. However, new
expenditures (e.g. pay increases for health workers) have been awarded without relevant provision in

                                                                    11
the MTEF and ­ in some cases ­ outside the budget process altogether. Under-execution remains an
issue, partly as a result of over-budgeting, especially for capital investments. As a result, the PFM
Reform Action Plan focuses on continued efforts to establish a rolling multi-year budget process that
integrates strategic and investment planning and minimizes deviations from budget appropriations
during budget execution.

35.     In the procurement area, the 2007 legislation on public procurement provides the basic
infrastructure, but the lack of institutional capacity in the contracting agencies, limited
instruments for monitoring and evaluation, and alleged instances of political interference often
compromise the implementation of the law. Improvement can also be noted with regard to
transparency of public procurement (e.g. publication of procurement notices on the Internet) and
accountability (annual report by the Public Procurement Regulatory Commission with data on all
public procurement processes submitted to the Assembly; independent Public Procurement Review
Body established). The remaining challenge is to ensure adequate implementation of the current legal
framework by building institutional capacity of the contracting authorities, addressing price deviations,
and promoting private sector participation in public tenders.


Strengthening wage bill management

36.      The second most important reform area to improve fiscal management rests with
strengthening wage bill management. The absence of clear pay and grading structures means that
there are no criteria for checking payroll data against personnel data, which, in turn, provides
opportunities for arbitrary behavior by the leadership of various budget organizations and undermines
the effective exercise of central fiscal and management controls. Despite improvements to the payroll
database (e.g. unique employee ID), which have all but eliminated inaccuracies such as double
positions by civil servants and other public employees, and the Treasury's efforts to enforce wage bill
ceilings on budgetary organizations, additional actions will be necessary to achieve efficient and
transparent payroll management. Reported instances of irregular use of other budget lines to top up
salaries of selected officials also undermine sound payroll management. The adoption of clear pay and
grading structures for the core civil service, as legislated in the recently enacted civil service reform
law, and other categories of public employees (e.g. teachers, health workers) will be a major step
toward creating a firm basis for the exercise of management and fiscal controls. The purpose of the pay
and grading reform is also to address the pay discrepancies, lack of career opportunities, and
vulnerability to politically motivated hiring and firing that undermine morale and performance in the
core civil service. Likewise, improvements in information technology systems, notably the
establishment of a real-time data exchange interface between the payroll and Treasury systems would
also facilitate the exercise of effective payroll controls. The weaknesses in both areas should be viewed
in the context of overall weak governance rather than as purely technical features of the PFM system.

38.      Poverty in Kosovo is widespread, at 45 percent or higher, and has not shown significant
signs of decline over a decade. While the growth rate in Kosovo was positive in the years before the
economic crisis, it did not lead to poverty reduction, with poverty increasing in rural areas, where more
than 60% of the population lives. In urban areas, which have benefited the most from donor-financed
growth, poverty decreased in the period from 2003 to 2006. However, preliminary results from the
2009 Household Budget Survey (HBS) indicate that urban poverty also increased in the aftermath of
the crisis, and estimate that the national poverty rate has risen to 49 percent. According to the 2009
HBS, about 22 percent of the population is estimated to be extremely poor, unable to meet basic
nutritional requirements. An additional 17 percent of the population is considered vulnerable to falling
into poverty were a 25 percent reduction in income to occur. But poverty is relatively shallow such
that a 25 percent increase in income could reduce the poverty rate by approximately one-third.

39.    Growth rates achieved so far have been insufficient to raise employment or reduce
poverty. The 2007 Poverty Assessment suggested that Kosovo would need to experience at least 6%
annual growth in real income in order to make inroads against unemployment and poverty. The

financed, had been insufficient to reduce poverty.       45

40.      Poverty is closely related to employment
status. Households with an unemployed head of            35
household have poverty rates around 57 percent           30
while those where the household head is employed         25                             Absolute 
with a salary have much lower, but still substantial,
poverty rates of 37 percent, according to the            20                             Extreme
preliminary results from HBS 2009. Furthermore,          15
poverty rates are also high for per diem (temporary)

workers at 65 percent, suggesting that in Kosovo, it
is not strictly the quantity of jobs which is a poverty   5

unemployed and per diem workers. The World
Bank's Kosovo Poverty Assessment assessed that a
10 percent reduction in the prevailing Source: Kosovo Poverty Assessment, 2007
unemployment in the population would be
associated with a 6 percentage point reduction in poverty. However, the same Report also put the
needed growth rate to create jobs that would reduce the unemployment rate by half over a period of 10
years at about 6 percent.

unemployed. Many of those who
do work do so without employment contracts and in the informal market. This large pool of
unemployed youth undermines social cohesion and risks destabilizing an already fragile state.

42.      Kosovo's labor market suffers from all the typical transition issues, made substantially
worse as a result of events during the conflict years which substantially curtailed education and
training opportunities for many youth. The typical transition issues include unemployment arising
from the dismantling of overstaffed state owned enterprises, an economy-wide shift to different sectors
as countries find their new comparative advantage and workers with inappropriate skills for the new
sectors in the economy. Kosovo suffers from all of these, but also faces specific issues related to its
history. In the late 1980's and early 1990's as a result of policies of the Milosevic regime, many ethnic
Albanians lost their formal sector jobs. Albanian children were removed from the school system,
forcing the Albanian population to set up a parallel education system for their children. Technical and
vocational education was at a particular disadvantage since it had to take place in improvised
classrooms and houses and on a theoretical basis rather than with practical training. In addition, all the
industrial linkages with Serbia ended during the conflict. As a result, a large percentage of the
population has been out of the formal labor force for 20 years; the skill set of those in the labor market
and those entering the market is mixed, given the uneven quality of the parallel education system; and
the conflict severed trade ties with the closest neighbors, throwing the economic system into a
standstill.

43.      The generation of stable employment through sustainable growth, coupled with effective
social and pro-employment policies, will require a sustained and longer-run, multi-sectoral effort
in institution building and effective policy reform. Given that it is critically important for the
economy to generate more and better jobs, the Government has turned to the MILES framework which
identifies the following five elements as key to job creation: (i) Macroeconomic stability, (ii)
Investment climate, (iii) Labor market policies, institutions, and regulations, (iv) Education, skills, and
training, and (v) Social protection policies which provide a safety net but encourage rather than impede
a return to the labor market. It is important to emphasize that these elements lay a foundation for
increasing employment in the medium term and long term, but are unlikely to have an immediate
short-run impact on employment. The Government will have to rely on providing a better safety net
for the working age population in the short run, but in a way that will encourage job search and entry
into the labor force as jobs become available. The importance of macroeconomic stability and fiscal
prudence, in particular, for growth and employment have already been discussed above. The other
elements of the MILES framework are discussed below.

Improving the investment climate

44.      Besides trust in a stable political and economic institutional environment, raising
investment levels in the longer run requires a favorable investment climate. Significant progress
has been made in Kosovo in putting in place the basic legal framework and institutional structures
necessary for a market-oriented economy. Most of the required commercial legislation has been
enacted, including laws on companies, bankruptcy, pledges, real property rights, foreign investment,
accounting, and mortgages. Simultaneously, substantial international assistance has been provided to
the relevant institutions to administer and enforce the laws. Moreover, on a number of business climate
indicators, Kosovo seems to be positioned well vis-à-vis its neighbors. For instance, labor markets are
relatively flexible with few constraints imposed on businesses to expand or replace their workforce;
the trade regime is open and liberal and the banking sector is relatively dynamic-- following the entry
of foreign banks and gradually rising depositors' confidence.

45.     The recently completed 2009 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey
(BEEPS) highlights the importance of transparent and predictable governance in a post-conflict
environment. In addition to the lack of reliable infrastructure, particularly inadequate power supply,
the two most common constraints reported by firms are related to the rule of law (Figure 5). The skills
and education of workers ranks fourth, with access to financing, unpredictability of the courts, and
access to land all highly ranked together with the infrastructure issues of telecommunications and
transport. A constantly evolving legal environment is a by-product of transition. This type of
uncertainty affects future investment and employment decisions of firms, as investors cannot assess
risks and calculate the cost-benefit ratios of possible investments with any degree of confidence. The
high degree of regulatory policy uncertainty, complexity and non-transparency also results from the
fact that municipalities in Kosovo are responsible for establishing the overall enterprise regulatory
regime. This includes development and enforcement of enterprise regulations such as licensing,
permits and inspections. This arrangement is based on UNMIK regulations and has been further
reinvigorated by the Status Settlement Proposal (Ahtisaari's package) which gives municipalities
broad powers to regulate economic activity within their jurisdiction.

46.      This year, Kosovo has also been included in the Doing Business report, ranking 113th out
of 183 countries overall. The report highlighted some of the same areas as BEEPS, but also
emphasized Kosovo's problems in dealing with the post-registration phase of starting a business,
which includes operational licensing and a variety of permits (ranking 164th), construction permits
(176th), and contract enforcement (157th).

47.      Business regulatory regimes differ throughout Kosovo, with different functions being
spread across various levels of government, making it difficult for businesses to comply. In many
cases, regulations are vague, poorly enforced, do not define service delivery standards for
administrative bodies, and involve multiple offices or directorates within a given municipality. Central
authorities handle some regulatory functions for the enterprise sector, such as industry-specific
licensing, business and tax registrations, with little coordination at both central and municipal levels.

48.       Property right problems are a direct consequence of the 1999 conflict. A large proportion
of land has been locked in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and public owned enterprises (POEs) with
little clarity regarding the rights of new owners to real estate when SOEs are liquidated. Many original
land tenure documents were moved to Serbia during the 1999 conflict and have not been returned. As
a result, only a fraction of land is currently registered in the Immovable Property Registration System
(IPRR) which does not cover registration of apartments, and a substantial portion of real estate
registration is out of date. Uncertainty about land use rights particularly affects foreign investors who
suffer informational disadvantage in comparison with domestic investors.

49.      With regards to access to finance, reforms of the Central Bank of Kosovo are ongoing
which would strengthen much needed access to finance by the private sector. A Financial Sector
Fiduciary Assessment conducted in May 2006 highlighted weaknesses in the Central Bank of Kosovo
(CBK), many of which have been remedied, particularly with regards to the banking sector. The CBK
amended regulations in line with international best practices and encouraged the consolidation of the
banking sector. This led to increased foreign participation in the sector and the liquidation of one loss-
making bank. But further reforms will be needed in establishing the CBK as a lender of last resort,
assuring the autonomy of the CBK, and laying the groundwork for a more diverse financial sector with
non-bank financial institutions. Improving access to finance will be especially important for
supporting growth of small-and medium sized enterprises which will be core to creating employment
in the years to come (see Box 1). Laws to address some of these weaknesses are currently being
drafted.

50.     Investment promotion will be an important complement to regulatory and policy reform.
A regional investors' survey4 has recently been conducted and found that the perception of Kosovo
among potential investors who did not invest in the country but invested elsewhere in the Southeast
Europe region is much worse than the perception of those who actually invested in Kosovo. This
underlines the importance of combining the two crucial actions of regulatory reform and active
investment promotion and outreach.

51.      While the flexibility of the Kosovan labor market is considered positive by business
managers, there is also the perception among the population that workers lack the protection
provided elsewhere in Europe and that these should be financed by labor taxes. Perhaps not
surprisingly, there is periodically demand for legislation that would increase worker protections and
benefits--e.g., generous maternity and sick leave benefits, large vacation benefits, restrictions on hours
worked, reduced flexibility for employers in hiring and firing decisions, unemployment insurance,
pension and health benefits. Indeed, Figure 6 shows that even among those employed many have only
temporary jobs. The employment protection framework provides for basic protection of workers
through the Essential Labor Law (2001), the Labor Inspectorate Law (2002) and the Occupational
Safety, Health and Working Environment Law (2003), but lack of enforcement remains a problem.
Moreover, the current legislative framework provides for a flexible labor market in terms of hiring and
firing -- the Doing Business employment rigidity index is one of the lowest in the region -- and labor
taxes are low. The balancing act in Kosovo is to improve both the quantity and quality of jobs for
workers without reducing the nascent labor demand through increased labor taxation.

53.      While the major problem facing workers is low labor demand, the Government has been
able to provide little in the way of services for job seekers. There is currently no framework for the
design, implementation and financing of labor market policies and insufficient capacity in public
institutions to implement or regulate employment programs. Neither the role nor the services provided
by Public Employment Services (PES) are well-defined, and PES operates with a small budget. The
coverage of PES-run programs is very low and the PES staff caseload ­ the ratio of clients to
employment counseling staff ­ is the highest in the region (1 to 3,200). Active labor market programs
(ALMPs) are financed by donors for the most part which has resulted in a proliferation of many small
and largely disconnected programs. Providing efficient employment services requires a clear
framework (including a legal basis) for public and private providers of labor market services and an
adequate capacity of public institutions (the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (MLSW) and PES)
to program, manage, implement, monitor, and evaluate ALMPs. Once a legal framework has been
developed, consolidation of the existing ALMPs can then take place and gaps and needs identified,
while overlapping programs are merged or eliminated. Box 2 discusses the experience on successful
ALMPs globally and Box 3 discusses Kosovo specific experience. Annex 4 contains an inventory of
the ALMPs that have existed in Kosovo.




                                                                19
                                Box 2: Design Features of Successful ALMPs

  Effective ALMPs are generally designed through careful piloting and evaluation. There are many different
  types of evaluations: (i) process evaluations focus on how a program operates and on activities undertaken in
  delivery; (ii) performance monitoring provides information on the extent to which specific program
  objectives are achieved (e.g., number of unemployed trained); and (iii) impact evaluations focus on the issue
  of causality to see whether a program has its intended impact.
  ALMPs should come into play early ­ after a period of unemployment of at most six months;
  Job-search assistance programs are found to be the most cost-effective (especially for youth), with wage and
  employment subsidy programs having a positive short-term impact but a less positive impact on the longer-
  term employment prospects of participants;
  In order to connect training programs to local and national labor market needs, the private sector and local
  communities need to be mobilized and involved in project design;
  Targeting of ALMPs is crucial, distinguishing between teenagers (who should be helped to remain in school
  and acquire qualifications) and young adults (who need help in acquiring work experience), and focusing on
  school drop-outs.
  ALMPs should insist on tight work-search requirements, in the interests of an early exit from unemployment;
  Integration of services into a combined, comprehensive package seems to be more successful than separate
  provision;
  Effectiveness of ALMPs is increased by greater involvement of social partners and of public authorities at all
  levels.

                                   Box 3: Kosovo Experience with ALMPs

  Kosovo has had and continues to have a number of active labor market programs (ALMPs) primarily
 financed by donors as noted in Annex 4. The experience with these programs is mixed. The most popular
 programs are focused on vocational education and training, but even in this area, the experience is varied, with
 some programs showing only a 40 percent placement rate while others show an 80 percent placement rate.
 These programs when implemented by PES under MLSW do have a positive impact on the institutional
 capacity of PES.
  ALMPs providing on the job-training, through apprenticeships and internships showed similar placement
 rates to the vocational education ones, approximately 25 to 30 percent. Most training programs in transition
 countries are able to achieve 70 percent placement. But as noted throughout, labor demand in Kosovo is
 extremely weak and even a well-designed program may not achieve high placement rates.
  Programs focused on financing start-ups and providing entrepreneurial services seem to have been
 successful in that 80 per cent of the new enterprises remain in operation 2 to 3 years after start-up, but these
 programs have very high costs per beneficiary and as a result have limited coverage.
  Public works programs, by contrast, showed the largest coverage and lowest cost per beneficiary, but the
 probability of jobseekers finding employment after these programs were completed has not been assessed.
 While the programs may not have had an appreciable impact on long term employment, they have provided a
 safety net for households, increasing worker income 28% for the workers involved in the programs.

Improving Education, Skills, and Training

54.     The BEEPS results indicate that 45 percent of businesses feel that the education and
training of workers is an obstacle to their businesses. As shown in Figure 5 above, a parallel
education system in the 1990's coupled with an absence of institutional infrastructure after the conflict
have led businesses to list poor worker skills as one of the most constraining factors for their

human capital typical of conflict countries and substantial out-migration prior, during, and after the
conflict, especially of individuals with high levels of human capital.

57.     Kosovo is now starting to lay the foundations for a National Qualifications System, which
would help provide adequate signaling information to potential employers to distinguish between
those who are qualified and those who are not. Following the adoption of the Law on
Qualifications in November 2008, the Council for Vocational Education and Training has developed
the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) in line with the European Qualifications Framework.
The NQF defines "the national mechanism for classifying qualifications awarded within the National
Qualification System according to a set of criteria defining levels and types of outcomes of learning".
The newly established National Qualifications Authority (NQA) will be responsible for the registering
of vocational qualifications and the quality assurance of the processes relevant to the validation,
assessment and certification of these qualifications. At the initial phase, the NQA aims to develop
standards on qualifications on seven to ten selected occupations that are compatible with the labor
market needs. The Ministry of Education, Skills and Training (MEST), with assistance from GTZ, is
developing a coherent conceptual approach for the establishment of seven Centers of Competence
(CoCs).6 The CoCs are intended to deliver high quality VET according to NQF standards, offer short-
term skills upgrading training for the existing workforce and business owners and adult education, and
support other Vocational Education and Training (VET) institutions as a leading agent. Closer
cooperation between the MEST and Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare is a key for offering
effective adult training.

58.     To improve the quality and relevance of education to labor market needs, the curriculum
and teaching for post-basic education need to offer a mix of general knowledge and practical
skills. Although vocational education accounts for more than half of the students at the upper
secondary level, it is still perceived as an option for low performers that do not make it into upper
secondary school rather than as a real alternative to general education. An improved competency-
based curriculum that would provide relevant skills for employment would help mitigate the stigma.
The curriculum for vocational education needs to be reformed towards development of thinking skills,
higher order behavioral skills such as decision-making, teamwork, and the ability to negotiate conflict
and manage risks, specific knowledge applied to real-life situations in practical subjects like science,
technology, economics, and foreign languages, and vocational skills. While an IDA-funded education
project currently supports the curriculum reforms for general education, the Government's reform
agenda prominently also includes upper secondary education as a whole, covering both general and
vocational education.

59.      On higher education, the government has recently taken a step to improve quality of
higher education institutions and programs. The Kosovo Accreditation Agency (KAA) was
established to develop and implement an accreditation system for higher education institutions, and is
now operational. At the request of the government, the British Accreditation Council evaluated all 30
private institutions, and concluded that none, except one, of the institutions should retain the status of
university. After the accreditation process, many of the remaining institutions were consolidated and
became institutes, colleges or faculties. Further strengthening of the external and internal quality
assurance mechanisms is the next step to insure the quality of higher education institutions and
graduates with better skills (see Box 7).

Providing adequate social protection that encourages participation in the labor force

60.     The social protection system in Kosovo has a major role to play particularly in the short
run in helping to maintain social cohesion. Improvements in the investment climate and in the skill
base are necessary to provide a stronger foundation for generating medium term employment, but they

will have little impact in the short run. There are essentially three types of benefits which could be
provided to alleviate some of the poverty while the medium term employment measures begin to have
effect: (1) unemployment benefits, (2) social assistance, and (3) direct jobs creation programs. Any
type of benefit provided would have to be financed without raising labor taxes to avoid stifling the
demand for labor. Unemployment insurance currently does not exist in Kosovo and is not
recommended for the near future since it typically is financed through labor taxes and the majority of
the unemployed do not have the earning or contribution histories typically required for eligibility.

most importantly, for the issue of
employment, they do not provide a bridge from social assistance to employment, penalizing those who
find limited work by eliminating the household from eligibility for any social assistance. A significant
number of the poor are in fact employed and thus ineligible for any type of social assistance as shown
in Figure 9. The level of the benefit is also low and had not been adjusted since its inception until
2009, resulting in an appreciable real decline in value.

62.    Direct job creation programs have been limited and financed for finite durations by
donors. The most notable of these is the Employment Generation Project which was in operation in
2005 and 2006 and provided short term employment for 3160 low skilled jobseekers, 40 percent of
whom were between the ages of 15-24. Thirty-eight public works projects were implemented resulting
in a 28% increase in income for those employed. Subsequent programs have focused on issues of
youth unemployment and on counseling, advisory, and training, with only limited provision of
temporary employment.

63.      In the short run, the Government could support the unemployed poor by providing a
public works program. There may be scope to incorporate some poor, unskilled workers within the
infrastructure projects already budgeted. Alternatively or in addition, the Government would need to
free up resources in the budget to support limited public works programs which could provide a social
safety net to more of the poor while encouraging them to work. If coupled with job training or training
in entrepreneurial skills, the public works program could even lead to some increases in permanent
employment although the primary focus would be providing income support to the unemployed.

64.    In the medium term, the Government is also considering moving beneficiaries capable of
work into a welfare to work program, where the benefits are only provided if the recipient

require participation in targeted employment services.

                               Box 4: Social Protection Programs in Kosovo

  The social protection system in Kosovo is at an early stage of development. The main laws that establish its
  architecture were adopted in the beginning of the 2000s. Most of the existing social protection programs are
  non-contributory. These comprise four main programs which include: (i) basic pensions; (ii) disability
  pensions; (iii) war veteran-related benefits; and (iv) a narrowly targeted social assistance scheme / last resort
  income support benefit. Along with the social assistance transfers, the overall safety net also includes social
  services for families and individuals at risk, delivered by a network of Centers for Social Work and
  Departments of Social Welfare in the municipalities. National and international NGOs participate in the
  delivery, and sometimes also in the financing, of social care services. Informal safety nets such as
  remittances also play an important role.

  The Last Resort Income Support program, which was introduced in 2003 (Law No. 2003/15 On Social
  Assistance Scheme in Kosovo), is narrowly targeted to two categories of poor families/households. Category
  I comprises of families/households where all members are qualified as `dependent' / not able to work. These
  are persons over 65 years of age; adults with permanent incapacity to work; full time care givers of a
  person(s) with permanent disability, or of a person(s) over the age of 65 needing full-time care, or of a
  child(ren) under the age of 5; children under the age of 15 or aged 15-18 if in full-time education; single
  parents with children under 15 years of age and without other adult in the family. Category II comprises of
  families / households where along with the dependent family members there might be family member(s) who
  are able to work. Every member of the family who is capable of working is registered with the Department of
  Labor and Employment of the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (MLSW) and is required to actively
  search for work. Also, families belonging to category 2 should have at least one child aged less than 5 years
  or should have full custody over an orphan aged less than 15 years.

     III.    THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

A.      PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REFORM ACTION PLAN

65.     Following a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment in
2007, the Government created a public financial management working group which undertook a
PEFA self-assessment in 2009. The working group, chaired by the Deputy Finance Minister,
subsequently prepared a PFM Reform Action Plan (PFMRAP), adopted by Government in January
2010, which identifies and prioritizes reform measures designed to address the main weaknesses
revealed by the PEFA self-assessment. The PFMRAP sets the relevant targets and timelines within the
next three years and identifies the institutions responsible for implementation of the reforms.

Improving public investment and overall budget preparation and execution

66.       The PFMRAP prioritizes measures to improve budget credibility both in terms of
budget preparation and budget execution with a particular focus on planning and management
of capital investment. On the budget preparation side, the PEFA assessment noted certain
improvements since 2007, notably the adoption and overall smooth implementation of a new Law on
Public Financial Management and Accountability (2008) and the improved synchronization of the
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) with the annual budget process. It also identified the
following shortcomings, which the PFMRAP seeks to address: insufficient integration between
strategic planning (including at the level of line ministries) with budget preparation and investment
planning; and over-budgeting, resulting in under-execution of the budget, especially for capital
investments. Similarly, on the execution side, the PEFA also finds that poor procurement and project
management practices result in capital budget under-spending. (More details on procurement issues
can be found in Box 5). Therefore, the PFMRAP prioritizes the following reform measures: improved
linkages of strategy and budgeting through the MTEF process; more realistic forward estimates and
capital project costing, including associated recurrent costs; more timely provision of information on
central grants for municipalities' budget preparation; in-year monitoring of capital budget
implementation by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF); and improved functional
classification in the chart of accounts. These are precisely the weaknesses which led to fiscal
loosening in 2009.

Improving Payroll Management
67.     The lack of a pay and grading system in the civil service has long complicated wage bill
management. This has undermined the predictability of wage expenditures, led to wide discrepancies
in pay levels for comparable positions in different government bodies, and made management and
payroll controls difficult. This problem is highlighted in the PEFA self-assessment as well as in
assessments by SIGMA (a European Commission-OECD institution specializing in monitoring and
supporting public administration reform in EU candidate and pre-accession countries) as well as in EC
Progress Reports.




                                                 25
                    Box 5 : Achievements and Challenges of Public Procurement

     Legal framework: The current Law on Public Procurement was adopted in 2007 and comes close to
     complying with EU norms. Secondary legislation was enacted in 2008. Further amendments to the
     legislation are currently under consideration with a view to clarifying the responsibilities of procurement
     bodies and speeding up procurement procedures.

     Institutional arrangements and capacity: Public procurement in Kosovo is decentralized, i.e. each
     budget organization may conduct its own procurement provided it has a trained and certified procurement
     officer. There are some 430 trained procurement officers in the Kosovo civil service, but capacity
     remains low, not least due to high staff turnover. There are three central bodies responsible for public
     procurement:

          o   The Public Procurement Agency is a Government agency which monitors procurement plans;
              may act as a central contracting authority, if requested by the Government; and considers
              waivers for the use of negotiated procedures. The institutional capacity of the Agency is rather
              limited, restricting its capacity to act as a central contracting authority for consolidated
              procurement, which could help increase efficiency.

          o   The Public Procurement Regulatory Commission is an independent agency reporting to
              Parliament and is responsible for issuing secondary legislation and guidance on procurement;
              training standards on procurement; publishing procurement notices and contract awards on its
              website; and monitoring procurement processes in an annual report (since 2006).

          o   The Public Procurement Review Body (PPRB) is an independent agency reporting to Parliament
              that reviews complaints related to procurement. This Body became operational in late 2008.

     Competitiveness and value for money: Competitiveness of public procurement is still limited.
     According to the 2008 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey only 11 percent of
     firms surveyed had participated in public procurement tenders. According to the Public Procurement
     Regulatory Commission report, the number of contracts awarded through competitive procedures has
     increased in recent years, but these accounted for only 44 percent of total contract value in 2008.
     Participation in public procurement tenders may be expected to increase as Kosovo makes further steps
     toward e-procurement (e.g. to allow firms to download tender documents and submit tenders
     electronically; currently only procurement notices and contract awards are published online).
     Value for money: A study conducted by the World Bank in 2008:(Review of the Public Purchasing
     System and Opportunities for Quick Gains Savings in Kosovo), also found significant price distortions in
     the prices paid by different contracting authorities for the same product or service. The study
     recommended specific reforms such as: consolidated procurement methods; using the lowest-price
     method for civil works; use of reference prices (e.g. for pharmaceuticals) and estimated the potential
     savings at EUR 12.3-18.3 million annually.


68.      The Government has therefore enacted new civil service legislation. The legislation
defines the scope of the civil service more narrowly to offer conditional tenure only to personnel
engaged in core policy and administrative functions in central government bodies and municipal
administrations (thereby excluding public employees directly engaged in public service delivery such
as teachers, healthcare staff, and police). The Law on the Civil Service and the Law on Civil Service
Remuneration, which were prepared with support from DFID, SIGMA, the World Bank and the IMF,
establish a uniform pay and grading system applicable throughout the core civil service and clearly
specify the elements of civil servants' remuneration. The definition of the coefficients of the new pay
system has been based on a comprehensive fiscal impact assessment, which was completed in
September 2009. The approved, but not yet ratified, Public Sector Modernization Project financed by


                                                      26
IDA will support the implementation of the pay and grading reform, including the linkage of the new
Human Resource Management Information System with the payroll database and the Treasury system.

69.      The Law on the Civil Service was enacted in June 2010. The base coefficient which is to
be defined in the secondary regulation will ultimately determine the fiscal costs of the legislation.
Fiscal costing of the law suggests that it will cost an additional 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent of GDP,
depending on the base coefficient chosen. The Government is opting for the lower end of the range.
Additional budget of  5 million has been included in the 2010 budget for implementation of the law,
with expected implementation around midyear. Full year implementation of the lower cost option for
the base coefficient is estimated to cost  8.5 million. Box 6 contains details on the Law on the Civil
Service.


                                      Box 6: Civil Service Legislation

  The new civil service legislation

  A package composed of two laws, the Law on the Civil Service and the Law on Civil Service Remuneration,
  aims to establish the legal framework for the civil service of Kosovo. This legislation replaces UNMIK
  Regulation 2001/36, which provided for temporary contracts for all public employees and did not include any
  grading or pay structure.

  Law on the Civil Service

          Establishes the scope of the civil service, narrowing the definition to include only administrative,
          professional, and managerial staff of central government bodies and municipal administrations (core
          civil service) ­ and exclude political appointees, non-administrative support staff (e.g. drivers,
          cleaners, security guards), and categories of employees engaged in service delivery, state security and
          law enforcement (e.g. teachers, healthcare workers, police, military, judiciary, customs officers).
          These categories will be covered under the Labor Law and/or specific legislation.
          Defines the rights and obligations of civil servants, including tenure of employment conditional on
          satisfactory performance and continued business need.
          Enables career progression for civil servants based on a unified grading structure and meritocratic
          principles (performance appraisal, promotions) applicable throughout the core civil service.
          Empowers a central government authority to oversee civil organizations' compliance with civil
          service management procedures, including the maintenance of an electronic personnel registry.

  Law on Civil Service Remuneration

          Defines the grading and pay structure composed of categories, grades, and salary steps applicable
          across civil service organizations. The pay system is a salary grid composed of a base coefficient (to
          be defined annually in the Budget Law) and multipliers corresponding to grades and horizontal steps.
          The multipliers are set in the secondary regulation on classification and grading of civil service posts.
          Specifies the elements of remuneration and other benefits that civil servants may receive and
          regulates elements of remuneration other than the basic salary (e.g. quotas on performance-based
          salary progression; limits on overtime pay for non-professional staff; rules for payment of expenses).




                                                      27
70.     The Public Financial Management Reform Action Plan (PFMRAP) prioritizes linking
payroll data with personnel information. Public sector wage bill management is a major weakness
in the PFM system as payroll data cannot be checked against personnel information. The PFMRAP
therefore prioritizes the linkage of the new Human Resource Management Information System, which
will contain personnel data, with the payroll database and the Treasury system to ensure real-time
controls of budget availability; and regular personnel and payroll audits.


B.      EMPLOYMENT STRATEGY

71.     An important step in the nascent institutional development after independence was the
creation of the Inter-ministerial Committee for Sustainable Employment in 2009. The
committee, headed by a Deputy Prime Minister, includes the Minister of Finance, the Minister of
Labor and Social Welfare, the Minister of Trade and Industry, and the Minister of Education, Skills,
and Training. Prior to setting up this committee, individual ministries were pursuing largely
uncoordinated employment initiatives and policies. The committee is now tasked with ensuring that
policies are evaluated and coordinated. In time, additional ministries could be included in this
committee.

72.      For the first time the Government drafted and adopted an employment strategy, derived
a three year action plan, and appropriately budgeted actions to be taken in 2010. Previous
employment strategies, largely drafted by donors and consultants, have had little traction. Creating
fiscal space for the actionable elements in the 2010 budget ­ at a time when the Government had to
propose a conservative overall budget -- demonstrates the priorities that the Government is placing on
employment and on implementing the strategy, which is based on the MILES framework discussed in
para 43. The actions from the Employment Strategy already included in the 2010 budget are shown in
Table 5. The overall spending envelope assigned to the implementation of the employment strategy is
 8 million or approximately 1 percent of overall expenditures, in addition to spending already
included in the ministry budgets and financing provided directly by donors.

73.      The employment strategy has also been presented to and discussed with social partners,
as well as donors. The Government has established a Performance Framework to evaluate its success
in carrying out the Employment Strategy. A meeting with donors was held in July 2009 during which
the Employment Strategy was presented to donors, and comments were solicited. A workshop was
held in November 2009 to which key social partners, the Chamber of Commerce of Kosovo, the
Alliance of Kosovo Businesses, the Union of Independent Trade Unions of Kosovo, and the
Confederation of Free Trade Unions of Kosovo, were invited. All attended and were given an
opportunity to ask questions after the presentation of the employment strategy and to provide written
comments afterwards.

Improving the investment climate


74.      To improve the investment climate, the Employment Strategy prioritizes easing
financing constraints and improving the regulatory framework for businesses. The Government
plans to ease financial constraints for businesses by supporting leasing arrangements, improving
registration of land and apartments within the IPRR, and promoting effective schemes to improve
access to finance for start-ups and existing small and medium size enterprises (SMEs). Leasing allows
credit-constrained enterprises to obtain new equipment without borrowing. A new leasing law was
passed on June 25, 2009 and has been in force since July 17, 2009, but the Government needs to
promote awareness of leasing as a potential alternative to loan financing. Improving the registration of
land and apartments within the IPRR (managed by the Kosovo Cadastre Agency ­KCA) will allow
their owners to use them as collateral to obtain finance (see Box 7). The Government also intends to


                                                        29
explore the applicability of microfinance schemes to the Kosovan context to increase lending to start-
ups.

                     Box 7: Kosovo Cadastre Agency Strategy and Business Plan

KCA Development Strategy
A three year development strategy 2009-2011 was drafted for the Kosovo Cadastre Agency (KCA). The KCA
Strategy consists of three main objectives: (i) improvement of the legal and institutional framework for cadastre
in Kosovo, (ii) efficient operations and use of advanced information technology, and (iii) improvement of the
cadastral services for clients.

KCA Business Plan
To implement the strategies, KCA prepared a Business Plan supported by a separate Action Plan. The Business
Plan is based on Kosovo Government's priorities and goals as well as the KCA Development Strategy 2009-
2011. It provides concrete actions for development of KCA and the cadastre sector in Kosovo. The Government
approved the Business Plan for 2009-2014 in June 2009.

Implementation of the Business Plan will, by facilitating protection of property rights contribute to economic
development, improved governance, i.e. the building of accountable and effective public administration and
improved legal framework and business environment. By providing security to real property rights and
establishing easy and safe mechanism for real property transactions, the Business Plan will assist Kosovo in the
development of the land market.


75.      The Ministry of Trade and Industry is reviewing rules and regulations of business
licenses, permits and the inspection framework. Recognizing that the current regulatory framework
imposes substantial compliance burden on enterprises, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) is
reviewing both the rules and implementation of business licenses, permits, and the inspection
framework to develop a more streamlined and transparent framework which harmonizes procedures at
central and municipal levels. In addition, the Government plans to establish a one-stop-facility at the
municipal level to streamline business regulations and reduce costs. The first of these has already
opened in the Municipality of Podujeva and seven more are expected to open by January 2011.

76.      The BEEPS survey had identified energy as one of the core constraints for businesses
which the Government, together with partners, is addressing outside of the employment
strategy. The Government is working closely with the World Bank Group, USAID and the EC to
identify a strategy based on lignite power and exploitation of all available hydropower limiting
negative environmental impacts while providing more reliable energy supplies to households and
businesses. The key elements of the strategy include (i) phased closure of the five outdated and
highly-polluting Kosovo A power generation units by the end of 2015; (ii) rehabilitation of Kosovo B
to comply with EU environmental standards and privatization of that plant; (iii) immediate
development through private participation of the Sibovc SW lignite mine and a state of the art power
plant; (iv) privatization of KEK distribution as a key element in the effort to improve efficiency; and
(v) development of the country's limited hydropower resources through public-private partnerships.

Improving and establishing labor market institutions, regulations, and policies
77.     The Employment Strategy focuses on issues including strengthening employment
services in Kosovo, providing the legal framework and institutional capacity to support active
labor market programs, and increasing employment protection. Modernizing employment
services in Kosovo includes upgrading PES software and hardware and establishing a reliable labor
market information system. PES needs to urgently update the unemployment registry, begin to
provide online placement services, and integrate software systems between employment offices, the
vocational training system, and social assistance centers. Coordinating with Vocational Training

                                                       30
Centers will allow the targeted unemployed to receive additional training. The labor market
information system would generate, analyze, and regularly disseminate labor market statistics drawn
from the employment service and labor market assessments, to determine skill shortages and employer
needs.

78.     The Government intends to create a comprehensive legal framework for the design,
implementation and financing of ALMPs, allowing services to be offered by the private sector as
well as the public. These would aim not only to provide a safety net for the unemployed but could
provide a bridge to stable future employment. In addition, the capacity of labor market institutions to
program, manage, implement, monitor and evaluate these programs needs to be strengthened. The
consolidation of redundant or ineffective programs would save financial and management resources.

79.     The Government intends to revise the Essential Labor Law which regulates employment
and labor relations and to increase compliance by strengthening labor inspection. The Labor
Law will be reviewed to provide reasonable protection for workers, while limiting the costs and
impediments to employers. There have been periodic demands to increase the level of worker
protections and benefits, similar to what existed in the former Yugoslavia. The Government
recognizes that in the environment of 45% unemployment, making employment more costly to
employers will be counterproductive. On the other hand, workers should not be subjected to
exploitation and inhumane conditions. The revised Labor Law will establish minimal protections, but
with special attention to minimizing the financial impact on employers. The Government plans to
strengthen labor inspection by creating an appropriate structure and organization for labor inspection
with appropriate training, by designing an effective enforcement policy that is transparent, coherent,
and manageable while not too burdensome for employers, and developing a system for monitoring
performance.

Improving education, skills, and training
80.     The Employment Strategy focuses on three areas in the area of education which will help
expand employment potential. These include (i) improving vocational education, (ii) strengthening
vocational training targeted at adults, and (iii) improving the quality of tertiary education.

81.      The Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MEST) plans to reform vocational
education to better bridge the gap between formal education and training. This would be
accomplished by introducing niche schools, so-called Centers of Competence, by strengthening the
link between school and work, and by reallocating responsibilities for technical and vocational
education and training to the schools themselves. The Centers of Competence will each focus on a
particular vocational field and will offer practical training with appropriate equipment by teachers
trained in programs designed in cooperation with industry and employers' organizations. The
transition from school to work will be facilitated through providing timely career information, job
search assistance, and work based training.

82.      The key policy measures with regard to vocational training include improving access to
adult education and lifelong learning opportunities and designing and implementing the overall
framework of qualifications. Vocational schools for adults, outsourced when feasible to external
providers, would together with the Centers of Competence provide opportunities for those whose skills
do not match current needs to be retrained. The training programs would be designed with the
assistance of industry and employers with specific attention to skills they find lacking in the current
labor force. These training programs would also be coordinated with the programs and needs of the
Public Employment Services under the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (MLSW). The quality of
training is to be monitored through tracer studies and employer surveys. To provide some signaling to
employers of a potential hire's qualifications, the National Qualification Authority is planning to

                                                  31
establish a national qualification framework with national competency standards adhering to the
European Framework for Qualifications which will provide a system of certification of skills that are
recognized and portable across enterprises, industries, and education/training institutions.

83.      To improve the quality of tertiary education and move towards compliance with EU
standards, the Kosovo Accreditation Agency will continue to accredit and license all providers of
higher education (public and private). Accreditation will be in accordance with the quality criteria
set forth in the legal provisions and standards envisaged by the Bologna system. As noted previously,
the lack of formal educational standards had allowed a number of higher education institutions to open
in recent years, which provided uneven education for enrolled students and little signaling information
to employers on the skills that a graduating student actually possessed. The Kosovo Accreditation
Agency has found that only one of the institutions was fully qualified as a higher education institution
and will continue to monitor and license any new institutions which appear (Box 8).




                                                  32
                      Box 8: The accreditation process for all higher education institutions

Immediately after the war, a handful of private institutions opened, only to see their numbers to rise to more than
two dozen within a few years. The perception persisted that some of the schools were for-profit enterprises which
provided degrees without offering quality education an charging fees between Euros 1,000 to 3,000 per year.
Consequently, the Law on Higher Education in Kosovo (Law 03/ 2002) and the Administrative Instruction for
Licensing Private Providers of Higher Education in Kosovo (AI 14/2003) required all private providers of higher
education to be licensed by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST). An Administrative
Instruction establishing the Kosovo Accreditation Agency (KAA) (AI 11/2004) was issued in February 2004, but
the Agency was not established until four years later. As a result, prior to July 2008, licenses had been granted or
withheld in a non-transparent manner. Several providers started programs without obtaining a license in the
expectation that these would be granted later.

Due to this delay in the establishment of the KAA and the new Government of Kosovo's need for a thorough
review of the Licenses which had been issued between 2003 and 2008, an initial accreditation exercise was
undertaken by the British Accreditation Council (BAC) on behalf of the MEST. The BAC Report recommended
that the Minister of Education issues a license to none but one institution, i.e., American University of Kosovo
(AUK). The recommendation was accepted and endorsed by Government. The most immediate consequence of
this decision was not to permit new enrolments in private higher education providers, other than the AUK. All
private providers were allowed a period of one year to prepare and apply for accreditation.

Early in the 2008/09 academic year, KAA announced guidelines needed to undertake accreditation reviews.
Reviews were undertaken of several Faculties of the University of Prishtina and those private providers that chose
to apply for accreditation. A common methodological approach was adopted, involving panels of independent,
international experts who had no other connection with the institutions under review as well as extensive
documentary scrutiny by KAA staff.

Several private providers engaged in merger discussions with one or larger institutions, hoping that the larger size
and wider curriculum scope resulting from their merger would permit them to be accredited as universities.
Eventually, applications were received from 13 institutions/groups during the 2008/09 process. Based on KAA's
recommendations, the Government decided that (i) one institution failed to meet the criteria and should not be
relicensed, (ii) six institutions were relabeled as colleges (thus permitting them to offer bachelor's and master's
programs, but not doctoral studies), (iii) three were relabeled as institutes, (iv) two were relabeled as higher
professional schools, and (v) one was relabeled as a higher technical school. All had conditions (either in respect of
accreditation or in respect of licensing criteria) attached to them. All were permitted to recruit students to their
accredited programs with immediate effect. A quota was later determined depending on the nature of the license.

That left the University of Pristina, a public institution, as the only school still able to bear the name of university
(and AUK as the only private provider), though the KAA recommended that four departments will have to close
because they had not met the criteria for accreditation: psychology, ethnology, pharmacy, and physiotherapy.

The licenses and accreditation of private providers are valid for academic year 2009-10, during which period KAA
will undertake on-going monitoring to ensure that accredited institutions comply with standards of accreditation.
KAA is working on defining responsibilities with regards to diploma production/recognition and preparing for the
re-accreditation process for next academic year. In addition, KAA plans to review other programs of University of
Prishtina, together with a greater engagement of the Univeristy's Quality Assurance Office and the Senate.

Providing adequate social protection that encourages participation in the labor force
84.      To provide increased social protection for the currently unemployed, the Ministry of
Labor and Social Welfare plans two main measures. These include (i) changing the criteria for
social assistance to provide more incentives for employment, and (ii) expanding labor-intensive public
investment and public works programs.

85.     Social assistance for households with members capable of work would become
conditional on requirements for job search and availability to work, and subject to participation
in targeted employment services. Currently, registration as unemployed is an eligibility requirement
with no incentive for individuals to move from unemployment toward work. Such a welfare-to-work
program would be piloted before being made universal.

86.     Public investment programs will be evaluated for their suitability in generating short
term jobs while public works programs will focus on building important local level community
assets and addressing infrastructural needs. These programs will help provide some immediate
safety net to the unemployed and may have a longer term positive impact on employment both through
the infrastructure they help create and in the potential for increased skills and training of the
participants.

87.      Separate from the employment strategy, the Government also raised social assistance
benefits in January 2009 to partially compensate for the cumulative inflation since their
inception. Social assistance benefits, which are received by approximately 46,000 households, were
provided at the rate of  35 per month for a single person with a maximum of  75 for a household
with 7 or more members. Since the  35 per month was set at the amount per person needed to
achieve the poverty line in 2003, the total size of the benefit did not even cover the poverty line for all
members of larger households. Similarly, the collapse of the contributory pension system during the
conflict had led the Government to adopt a flat benefit of  40 per month per elderly, or disabled,
person regardless of past income or contribution history. The benefit levels in both programs had been
held constant, for social assistance since 2003 and for pensions since 2005. While inflation in general
in Kosovo has been low, towards the end of 2007, there was a sharp increase in food prices. The
decision in January 2009 was calibrated to cover the cumulative inflation since 2005 for the pensioners
and the same  5 increase per household was provided to social assistance beneficiaries as well. Since
the increase was not awarded per person, the increase was not sufficient to bring the entire household
to the poverty line, but was limited by budget constraints. This measure helped mitigate the adverse
impact from the crisis-related slowdown in growth.

          IV.     WORLD BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

A.      LINK TO INTERIM STRATEGY NOTE AND IDA FINANCING OF THE OPERATION


88.      The proposed SEDPP is the centerpiece of the Bank's support for Kosovo as described in
the Interim Strategy Note for the period FY10-11. The Interim Strategy describes a selective and
targeted program focusing on (i) accelerating growth that is broad-based and employment-generating;
and (ii) supporting social cohesion through governance reform and the building of transparent,
inclusive institutions. The proposed SEDPP cuts across both pillars of the Interim Strategy Note
(Report No. 49872-XK, presented to the Board February 4, 2010) and provides a policy and
institutional umbrella for the Bank and other donors' investment activities, both ongoing and planned.

89.     The proposed operation follows the Bank Board's approval on July 3, 2008 of the use of
$40 million of the IBRD FY08 surplus to provide grant support for Kosovo. The Board approved
the use of such grant funds specifically for a three year programmatic SEDPP operation, to be
administered by IDA. At the time of Board approval, Kosovo had declared independence, but had not
applied for membership. Subsequently, the Board of Governors voted to establish the trust fund for
Kosovo SEDPP (Kosovo Sustainable Employment Development Trust Fund, TF071152). By the time,
the Board of Governors voted on the trust fund, Kosovo had submitted its membership application.
The Bank donation was expected to serve as seed money for other donor contributions and has done so
effectively raising an additional $60 million from 11 external partners who have partnered with the
Government and Bank in developing the three-year program contained in this operation.

90.   In addition, Kosovo is eligible for SDR 4.3 million on IDA terms from the Crisis
Response Window. This amount is being added to the amount provided by SEDPO 1.


B.      COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS
91.    Kosovo has a European perspective. As such, all supported legislation and regulations are
expected to move forward in the direction of compliance with European standards and legislation.

92.     The Bank team and Kosovo's partners have worked closely with the IMF to support the
Government in regaining fiscal control. The Government has now come to agreement with the IMF
on a macro framework and has requested a Stand-By Arrangement which has been approved by the
IMF Board. The Bank team closely coordinates with the IMF and the other donors in providing
support to the Government, such as the work on the energy sector and the recent public expenditure
review.

93.      The proposed SEDPP is co-financed by pledges from eleven donors, limiting the
transactions costs of the Government interacting with each donor separately. Activities of a
multitude of donors in Kosovo have led to increased efforts to go beyond coordination per se and seek
the identification of joint financing opportunities. The SEDPP is the largest of these joint financing
efforts. The eleven pledged donors include the UK, Finland, Switzerland, the European Commission,
the Czech Republic, Italy, Sweden, Estonia, Norway, Denmark, and the US. There is also close
coordination among donors. In addition, individual donors contributing to the SEDPP are providing
additional funds for technical assistance when such needs have arisen. SEDPP financing meetings
have resulted in closer coordination between the various donors beyond the immediate actions
supported through the program. This coordination has been especially helpful to a new government
given the transaction and opportunity costs of interacting with a multiplicity of donors. Details of the
donor pledges to SEDPP are shown in Table 6.

94.      Technical assistance provided by the donors is critical to the Government's ability to
succeed with program implementation. The complementary technical assistance provided by the
World Bank and other donors is shown in Table 7 below. For example, the Employment Strategy
received support from both World Bank and DFID funded labor economists. DFID financed a study
on investment climate. Land titling and property rights reforms have received assistance from SIDA,
Norway, Switzerland, GTZ and the World Bank. The EC and the World Bank have been providing
support on business regulation while access to finance issues has been supported by USAID, KfW,
Denmark, and the EC. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare is to benefit from EC funded
capacity building which is partly provided by the European Training Fund (ETF). The EC is also
planning to support the review and revision of the employment and social benefits systems. The Bank
is providing technical assistance for the revision of the labor law and a feasibility study to improve the
impact of ALMPs. The education sector has received support on accreditation of higher education
institutions through Austrian Aid and the British Accreditation Council. The National Qualifications
Framework for vocational education has received support from GTZ and from the EC. The Swiss and
GTZ have also been active in the general field of vocational education while Finland has supported
institutional development for inclusive education and Sweden provided support for capacity building
and the Education Reform Program. Denmark funds an Employment Promotion Program covering the
Horticultural Sector (together with Switzerland), Finance (with EFSE) and in the field of education an
"Improving Employability of Youth" component which will assist MEST in enhancing the
employability of graduates from upper secondary vocational schools in the fields of agriculture and
food processing. Finally, the public financial management reform action plan is being supported by
technical assistance from the EC, DFID, USAID, the IMF, GTZ, and IDA.

C.      RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER WORLD BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
95.     The Government of Kosovo is currently implementing eight IDA-financed operations,
five of which are directly linked to the current program. The Education Project supports
improvements in education, skills and training.        The Business Environment TA supports
improvements in the investment climate through reviewing business regulation, licensing, and
inspection. The Financial Sector TA assists by improving the capacity of the Central Bank to
supervise banks and non bank financial institutions which will strengthen access to finance. The
recently approved Public Sector Modernization Project supports the PFM Reform Action Plan. And
the recently approved Real Estate Cadastre Project supports improvements in property rights which
also help the investment climate. Two additional operations are planned which will provide social
support to vulnerable and poor groups through the Social Inclusion and Local Development Project
and the Second Kosovo Youth Development Project.

96.      IFC's ongoing activities in Kosovo have been relatively limited to date ­ focusing mainly
on the financial sector and, to a lesser extent, mining. IFC's activities are expected to increase
significantly now that Kosovo is a member of the World Bank Group. In the financial sector, the main
emphasis has been on supporting small enterprise growth by developing a microfinance institution,
ProCredit bank as well as by expanding SMEs' access to credit through the formal banking sector.
More recently, IFC has supported Lydian Resources, a base metal company, to enhance exploration of
lead and zinc reserves in Trepce. MIGA's portfolio does not currently include any projects in Kosovo.


D.      LESSONS LEARNED


97.      The preparation of the SEDPP draws on a number of key lessons learned from work in
both Kosovo and other fragile states. These lessons include: (i) the importance of a programmatic
approach which allows flexibility while providing a framework for policy development; (ii) the ability
of a relatively small budget support operation to generate significant leverage over policy and
legislative reforms; (iii) the importance of tying in a budget support operation with technical assistance
provided by the Bank or other donors; (iv) the positive boost provided to the Government from a
coordinated donor effort to support the Government's own program; and (v) the importance of
ownership by the Government.




                                                   37
         Box 9: Lessons from the Public Expenditure Management Technical Assistance Grant

        The Public Expenditure Management Technical Assistance Grant (PEMTAG) was designed to
 strengthen public expenditure management in key central government institutions. These included the
 Ministry of Finance and Economy, and the Ministries of Health, Transport, and Labor and Social Welfare.
 The project's PFM component had three subcomponents: (a) technical assistance and training in budget
 formulation for the three line ministries and their counterpart budget analysts in the Ministry of Economy and
 Finance (MEF); (b) technical support to the MEF's cash management unit to improve the quality of financial
 information; and (c) one-on-one mentoring in public procurement to ensure that the recently enacted public
 procurement law was implemented as intended.

       The project objectives were largely met by the closing date of March 31, 2009. This is evidenced in the
 Government's recent update of the World Bank 2007 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability report.
 The update shows substantial improvements in the areas of the budget formulation, accounting, and reporting.
 Some improvement in procurement was also reported. The Project also helped lay the basis for policy-based
 budgeting, as reflected in the most recent Medium Term Expenditure Framework.

        Experience in project preparation and implementation nevertheless demonstrated the importance of
 donor coordination. The components of the project had to be carefully designed to avoid overlaps with the
 activities of other donors. Project experience also showed the importance of beneficiary commitment and
 intensive supervision in projects of this kind. Support to the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare largely
 failed, due to weak commitment on the part of the beneficiary. Project implementation was substantially
 delayed due to insufficient supervision (given the counterparts' unfamiliarity with World Bank procedures)
 during the project's first year.


98.     Experience from other fragile states emphasized the advantage of development policy
operations to consolidate and coordinate external partners around a common, government-led
program. The Government of Kosovo requested specifically that donor support be provided in the
form of budget support to allow the Government to identify its priorities, and for the donors to provide
financial support. In the proposed SEDPP, the Government clearly identified its priorities by drafting
and adopting the Employment Strategy and PFM Reform Action Plan. Consequently, the Government
requested both budget support and technical assistance specifically targeted toward meeting its
objectives. Given the fragility of the institutions in Kosovo, donor support of the Government's own
program strengthens the credibility of these institutions while improving their efficiency by reducing
the requirement for close interactions with multiple donors with multiple objectives.

99.      In the case of other fragile states it was found that combining development policy
operations with other sector projects or capacity-building initiatives help make the reforms
easier to implement. In the proposed operation, the areas covered and the disbursement triggers are
all in areas in which technical assistance is either provided by the World Bank Group or one of the
partner donors, as shown in Table 7.

100.    A programmatic approach provides the flexibility needed in an uncertain environment
like that in Kosovo. Experience in the development engagement with fragile states suggests that there
are greater risks that progress will not proceed as smoothly as anticipated. The programmatic approach
taken here will allow the budget support to adjust flexibly to emerging priorities.

101.     Experience from the earlier budget support provided to Kosovo suggested that a
relatively small operation could generate momentum to enact policy and legislative reforms.
Particularly in a new and fragile state which is faced with establishing a new legal framework for every
sector, new institutions, and new processes, policymakers face a multitude of simultaneous demands.
The co-financed budget support operation can help move critical decisions forward, allowing Kosovo to
derive the maximum benefit from the technical assistance provided.

102.   Ownership by the Government is a crucial element for success. The Government's drafting
and adoption of its own strategies and action plans, including the allocation of sufficient budget to
implement these strategies, are signals of the Government's ownership.

                          Box 10: Development Policy Operations in Fragile States
 The Bank has undertaken successful development policy operations in a number of fragile states, including
 Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, West-Bank Gaza and Timor-Leste. Experience has shown that the potential
 benefits of development policy operations during fragile transitions often justify the risks of engagement.

 A useful approach has been to combine development policy operations with other sector projects or capacity-
 building initiatives which help make the reforms easier to implement. The development policy operation can
 help anchor the overall framework of budget allocations, policy and legislative actions while sector projects
 help capacity and monitoring of these commitments. Programs can either be broadly focused as in the case of
 Timor-Leste or more narrowly focused as in the case of West Bank-Gaza. In either case, a programmatic
 approach is appropriate, allowing flexibility to accommodate uncertainties in implementation capacity while
 providing a framework for policy development.

 Fragile states may also require much more detailed programs than usually seen in other development policy
 operations. Detailed action planning helps the government and program partners track progress and adjust to
 delays in program implementation.

 Finally, development policy operations provide an opportunity to consolidate and coordinate external partners
 around a common, government-led program. Design of a common program, backed by a wide range of
 external partners, can help the government assert its leadership and reduce the risk of policy drift arising from
 multiple bilateral discussions.

E.      ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS


103.    A significant body of analytical work has supported the Government of Kosovo and
informed the SEDPP. This includes (i) poverty assessments in 2007 and earlier; (ii) Human
Development policy notes which analyzed education, health, labor markets, and social protection
policies (June 2008); (iii) the Kosovo Youth Employment Study (September 2008) (iv) public
expenditure reviews in 2007 and 2010; (v) a Country Economic Memorandum in 2010 focusing on the
investment climate; (vi) the BEEPS 2009; (vii) Doing Business study; and (viii) the PEFA self-
assessment 2009. This body of work supports the Government's focus on sustainable employment as a
major priority and supports the cross-sectoral approach to increasing more and better jobs rather than
focusing purely on labor market policy. The PEFA self-assessment similarly has guided the
Government's focus on the areas in public financial management which need immediate attention.

                              V.       THE PROPOSED OPERATION

A.      OPERATION DESCRIPTION


104.    The Kosovo SEDPP supports the Government of Kosovo in (i) maintaining a stable
macroeconomic framework through strengthened budget/fiscal management as well as increased
transparency and, accountability of public expenditures, and (ii) laying the institutional and legislative
foundations that Kosovo needs for sustainable employment and growth.

105.    The Government has identified improving public financial management as a key priority
critical to maintaining macroeconomic stability and generating growth.                The Government
undertook the PEFA self-assessment to highlight the priority areas for reform. It has since developed a
PFM Reform Action Plan which was approved by Government on December 10, 2009 which tackles all
of the relevant areas. The first pillar of the proposed SEDPP supports critical elements of the PFM
Reform Action Plan to (i) improve budget preparation and execution; and (ii) strengthen wage bill
management. A limited number of benchmarks have been selected as evidence that the authorities have
made significant progress in achieving the goals. Technical assistance is being provided by the World
Bank Group or by other donors in all of the selected areas.

106.     The Government has identified laying the institutional and legislative foundations for
generating sustainable employment as another of its key priorities. Given the extremely low levels
of employment, bringing more Kosovans into good and stable jobs will be a core building block for
social cohesion in the medium-term. The Government recognizes that given the low level of labor
demand and the many constraints to employment and growth, large increases in employment will not
take place in the immediate future. However, policy changes and the building of appropriate
institutions will positively impact employment in the medium run, and the Government has developed
an employment strategy to lay the course for the medium run, while providing a safety net to those
currently unemployed.

107.    The second pillar of the proposed SEDPP supports critical elements of this employment
strategy. These include (i) improving the investment climate, (ii) improving and establishing labor
market institutions, regulations, and policies, (iii) improving education, skills, and training, and (iv)
providing adequate social protection that encourages participation in the labor force. A few critical
elements have been selected from the broader employment strategy in each of these areas that could
potentially become bottlenecks for progress if decisions are not made or could help pilot potentially
useful approaches. Technical assistance is being provided to the Kosovan counterparts in all of the
selected areas by the World Bank Group and by the bilateral and multilateral partners supporting the
SEDPP.

108.     As Kosovo's institutions grow stronger over time, the Government needs to increasingly
set its own budget and policy priorities to be supported by donors. The proposed operation helps
strengthen government credibility and confidence by providing support to a program that is fully
identified and owned by the Kosovo Government rather than outside experts. It also helps coordinate
eleven donors and the World Bank around a common set of priorities which were defined by the
Government itself. As noted in Table 8, the proposed program follows the recommended good practice
principles for selection of prior actions and triggers to assess progress in the implementation of the
Government's sustainable employment program.

B.      IMPROVEMENTS IN PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT


109.   Sustainable Employment Development Policy Operation 1 (SEDPO1) would support the
Government's strategy of improving the transparency and accountability of public finances
through implementation of the PFM Reform Action Plan. The support specifically addresses (i)
improvements in public investment and overall budget preparation and execution and (ii) strengthened
wage bill management.

Improvements in public investment management and overall budget preparation and execution
110.     The Government's PFM Reform Action Plan brings a longer-term perspective to budget
preparation and execution and strengthens internal controls and audit, external audit, and
procurement processes. SEDPO1 would support Government approval of the PFM Reform Action
Plan with implementation of the plan and specific benchmarks noted for the second and third
operations. Weaknesses in budget planning and execution together with loose procurement processes
contributed significantly to the unsustainable fiscal expansion in 2009. The second and third operations
are expected to support action on measures included in the PFM Reform Action Plan, specifically a
mechanism to strengthen the linkage of strategic planning in the line ministries with the MTEF, a
requirement that data on recurrent costs be presented for approval of all new capital projects,
submission of a capital budget execution report, establishment of a system of forward estimates, and
pilots from the Quick Gains Study on procurement practices. All of these measures will lead to better
fiscal management.

Strengthening wage bill management
111.  The PFM Reform Action Plan highlighted the importance of strengthening wage bill
management to which the Government has responded with a Civil Service Law for core civil

servants and a Law on Civil Service Remunerations. The first operation, SEDPO1, would support
the enactment of the Civil Service Law and the Law on Civil Service Remunerations. The law will set
in place a grading system for core civil servants such that people with equivalent job qualifications and
responsibilities across ministries will be graded the same and paid the same. The second and third
operations would support progress in pay and grading reform for the core civil service and linkage of
the payroll database with the Treasury system in real-time with regular personnel and payroll audits.

C.       LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR SUSTAINABLE EMPLOYMENT
112.    The proposed SEDPO1 is supporting increased policy coordination in employment issues
through: (i) the creation of a permanent inter-ministerial committee on sustainable employment,
(ii) approval of its action plan; and (iii) inclusion of 2010 actions in the 2010 budget. The
framework for employment generation cuts across ministries and requires coordination to be truly
effective. For example, in designing appropriate vocational training programs, MEST needs to closely
coordinate with the MTI about employer needs and with the MLSW on how to get the unemployed into
the vocational training programs. Triggers for subsequent years include appropriation of funding for
each year in the budget for that year.

Improving the Investment Climate
113.     The program would support three particular areas cited in the BEEPS survey. Several
other areas cited in the BEEPS survey will be supported through other instruments of the Bank Group
and the donor community. The SEDPP would focus on policy and institutional changes in (i)
streamlining of business licensing, inspections, and regulations, (ii) better establishment of property
rights, and (iii) improved access to finance.



                                                             45
114.    The action for SEDPO1 supports access to credit by finalizing a strategy and business
plan for the Kosovo Cadastre Agency and enactment of the Leasing Law which took place July
17, 2009. Registering real estate property and apartments allows land to be better utilized and permits
property to be used as collateral, thereby increasing access to credit. Leasing allows finance-
constrained businesses to rent or lease capital equipment rather than buying it, allowing business
expansion despite limitations on access to credit.

115.    Triggers for the second and third operations will focus on the streamlining of business
licensing, inspections, and regulations, and on actions which further improve the access to
finance. The second operation would support one-stop provision of business services which help to
streamline and reduce business costs and the modernization of the pledge registry which facilitates the
use of collateral to obtain finance. The third operation would then support continued streamlining and
simplification of business licensing and inspections.

Establishing and improving labor market policies, institutions, and regulations
116.  The proposed SEDPP supports the development of new labor legislation that provides a
framework for the design, implementation and monitoring of labor market programs without
compromising labor mobility or reducing the demand for labor.

117.    SEDPO2 and SEDPO3 focus on establishing and strengthening the legislative framework
governing employer-employee relations and the design, implementation and financing of labor market
programs, without increasing labor costs, and on improvements in labor market information and
consolidation of ALMP initiatives.

Improving education, skills, and training
118.    The program supports improving the quality and relevance of educational programs for
producing the skilled workforce necessary for a productive economy, strengthening the links
between school and work and increasing the quality assurance of tertiary institutions and
secondary vocational schools. SEDPO1 supports review and accreditation of all tertiary institutions
while the third operation would supports redefining the curriculum in vocational education to support

                                                            46
the qualifications framework and to respond to the needs of employers. Employers have noted in the
BEEPS survey that low skills are the fourth greatest obstacle to their businesses in Kosovo. In the past,
vocational training has not been tied to employers' needs and the weaknesses in accreditation and
quality control have prevented the education system from providing adequate signals to employers on a
potential worker's skill levels.

Providing adequate social protection that encourages participation in the labor force
119.    SEDPP would support the expansion of social protection programs, both through
increases in benefit levels to reduce extreme poverty and through increases in coverage, but while
encouraging rather than discouraging participation in the labor force. Given the medium to long
term time frame for many of the labor demand increasing measures to take effect, the Government will
need to provide some social benefits for the large percentage of the population in poverty and those
especially hurt from the impact of the global economic crisis. However, the social benefits need to be
designed to encourage a return to the workforce.

120.    The first operation supports increases in social benefits to accommodate the cumulative
inflation since 2005, when benefit levels were last changed. The increase in benefit levels is a crisis
mitigation response to help the vulnerable cope with an increase in food prices in late 2007 and early
2008 and with the slowdown in growth coming from the financial crisis. Social assistance currently
supports only those who are registered as unemployed, with loss of benefits for the household if a
family member becomes employed.

121.     The second and third operations support expanding coverage of public assistance but in
ways that encourage employment. Triggers for the second operation include launching a public
works program which would expand the number of households receiving assistance while improving
infrastructure in Kosovo. Triggers for the third operation include revision of the social assistance
framework toward general targeting rather than unemployment based targeting and including incentives
and training to enable beneficiaries to move from assistance to work.

                              VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT
122.    Overall the actions supported under SEDPO1 are expected to contribute to poverty
reduction in Kosovo, especially over the medium term. The majority of Government policies
supported under SEDPO1 are geared to lay the foundation for institutional development that would
lead, over time, to a rise in investment and labor demand. Such increased levels of employment would
then contribute to poverty reduction. The Kosovo Poverty Assessment noted that a 10 percent
reduction in the prevailing unemployment rate can expect to reduce poverty also by 6 percentage
points.

123.    The social protection policies supported by the operation, which directly increase the level
of benefits to recipients, will have a small but positive impact on poverty reduction. In 2009, the
Government increased the social assistance transfer benefit level for the first time since 2003,
increasing the benefit by  5 per recipient household. It is estimated that this adjustment reduced the
poverty headcount (below what it would have been in the absence of the adjustment) by 0.1 percentage
point overall, and by 0.8 percentage points among social assistance recipients. Poverty also would
have been deeper without the  5 increase in 2009. The poverty gap measures both the proportion of
the population that are below the poverty line and the average amount by which the poor are below the
poverty line. Increasing social assistance benefits in 2009 is estimated to have reduced the poverty gap
by 0.1 percentage points (1.2 percentage points among social assistance recipients).

124.    Increasing pension benefits in 2009 by  5 per beneficiary, the first increase since 2005, is
estimated to have reduced poverty by 0.5 percentage points (1.4 percentage points among pension
recipients). Poverty also would have been deeper without the recent 5 per pension beneficiary
increase. Increasing pension benefits in 2009 by  5 per beneficiary is estimated to have reduced the
poverty gap by 0.3 percentage points among the overall population, and by 1.1 percentage points
among pension recipients. Even though many pension recipients are not poor or near-poor, the pension
increase had greater poverty reducing impact for two reasons. First, pensions reach a larger proportion
of the poor and near-poor population than targeted social assistance transfers. That is, pensions have
higher coverage rates. Second, as the pension increase was  5 per pensioner, for households with
multiple pensioners the increase was larger than the social assistance increase of  5 per household.
The second and third operations will further consolidate poverty reduction by supporting the extension
of public works programs and welfare to work programs to a greater number of recipients8 and help
move people from reliance on social benefits to higher income work.

125.   The other measures supported by this budget support operation do not easily lend
themselves to quantitative assessment, but can all be seen to support the institutional
environment for employment creation and poverty reduction, even if these effects are likely to
materialize over the medium term. In particular:

        a.      Improvements in the investment climate are all expected to foster employment
        creation in the medium term and thereby reduce poverty. Simplifying the licensing,

8
 For example, it has been estimated that, even before the current increase, extending the coverage of social
protection to all the extremely poor households would have resulted in a decrease in poverty of 0.4 percentage
points (2.1 percentage points among recipient households.)

                                                       48
        registration, and inspection requirements for businesses should encourage the creation of new
        businesses. Improving property rights both increases access to finance by allowing individuals
        to use property as collateral and enhances the purchase and sale of land allowing more efficient
        allocation of existing land. Finally, access to finance will also enhance the creation of new
        businesses.

        b.       Improving the quality of labor policies and institutions will enhance individual
        ability to find jobs in the medium term. Better employment services will help workers find
        available jobs more quickly. Better labor market monitoring will allow the Government to
        make interventions when necessary. The Labor Law will improve the quality of jobs by
        providing workers with at least minimal protections without significantly adding to employer
        costs.

        c.       The education policies supported under the program help to alleviate future
        poverty by providing a better trained work force for the future. Given the high rate of
        unemployment among youth, better training and better transition from school to work will help
        alleviate poverty among this vulnerable group. Improvements in the quality assurance of
        graduates from general, vocational and higher educational institutions will increase employer
        confidence in the skills of the workers they hire and will promote increased employment which
        will ultimately reduce poverty.

        d.       The public financial management reforms supported under this operation will
        have a more indirect, but still positive impact on poverty by making Government more
        efficient. If Government is more efficient, more transparent, and more accountable, it can
        achieve more with fewer resources, leaving more resources for needed infrastructure
        investment and for the private sector to invest in growth. Furthermore, maintaining
        macroeconomic stability is key to both growth and poverty reduction.

        e.      The submitted civil service law explicitly grandfathers current civil servants so
        that no current civil servant will face a salary decrease for the next 3 years. The law
        provides a clear career progression for civil servants and protection against arbitrary dismissal
        when the government changes party affiliation.

B.      ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
126.     The specific policies supported by the operation are not likely to have significant effects
on Kosovo's environment and natural resources. The measures supported under the operation are
primarily geared toward increasing sustainable employment and improving public financial
management. These will cover improvements in business licensing, enhancing of property rights, and
access to finance as well as improvements in the education sector, in labor market policies, institutions,
and regulations, and in pension and social assistance provision. The public financial management
reforms will focus on increasing transparency and accountability in public finances and improved
public wage bill management. None of the sectors included in the operation are expected to have any
significant links to the environment.

C.      CONSULTATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS

127.    The core strategies underlying SEDPP, the Employment Strategy and the PFM Reform
Action Plan, have been presented to and discussed with social partners, as well as donors. For the
Employment Strategy, the Government has established a Performance Framework to evaluate its
success in carrying out the Strategy in a transparent and open manner. A consultation was held in July
2009 during which the Employment Strategy was presented to donors and comments solicited. Further,

                                                   49
a workshop was held in November 2009 with key social partners, the Chamber of Commerce of
Kosovo, Alliance of Kosovo Businesses, the Union of Independent Trade Unions of Kosovo, and the
Confederation of Free Trade Unions of Kosovo. The discussion and exchange, as well as comments
received after the workshop, were the basis for revisions to the strategy.

128.    Donors and stakeholders were also invited to comment on the PFM Reform Action Plan
when it was distributed in July 2009. Extensive intergovernmental consultations took place on the
Action Plan given that its implementation will require changes in the processes affecting individual line
ministries, budget organizations, and municipalities. The final version prepared in October 2009 takes
into account comments from both donors and stakeholders and was presented to donors and
stakeholders in early December 2009.

D.      IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION
129. The implementation of the program will require close coordination between the Bank
team and the respective institutions responsible for implementation. These include the Ministry of
Economy and Finance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Local Government
Administration, municipalities, the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, the Ministry of Education,
Science and Technology, the Public Procurement Agency, the Public Procurement Regulatory
Committee, the Office of the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Public Service, all of which will
provide the requisite baseline data from which to measure outcomes by the end of the program (Table
9). The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister through the Interministerial Committee on Sustainable
Employment will assist in the coordination of information reporting on the program's monitoring
indicators. These will be tracked, discussed and assessed among the Bank team and implementing

E.      FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
130.     The Public Financial Management system in Kosovo is judged adequate to support a
DPO, and the Government has shown a strong commitment to continued PFM reform. In recent
years Kosovo has received substantial external support and made significant progress in establishing a
workable Public Financial Management (PFM) system, including support from donor projects (e.g.
USAID, EC, DFID, CIDA, and IDA's PEMTAG).                 In particular, the EU has provided support in
improvement of ICT systems that directly relate to the EU acquis, notably revenue administration,
public procurement as well as capacity for internal control and internal and external audit. The main
strength of the PFM system is the Single Treasury Account and automated payments system, which is
now used by all primary spending units enabling centralized budget execution and production of timely
and reliable financial reports. The Treasury system, which was established with support from CIDA and
USAID soon after the creation of the Ministry of Finance and Economy, one of the first Provisional
Institutions of Self-Government to be set up, is the cornerstone of Kosovo's PFM system.

131.    Kosovo scored highly in some indicators related to budget execution in the first PEFA
assessment conducted in 2007. The PEFA exercise has helped build a sense of pride in and ownership
of the PFM system by the Kosovo Government. Officials from Kosovo have also participated actively
in the communities of practice of the Bank-sponsored PEMPAL (Public Expenditure Management
Peer-assisted Learning) program, where they have had the opportunity to exchange good practices with
colleagues from other ECA countries. This experience, combined with expectations from international
development partners and the prospect of donor assistance being increasingly channeled as budget
support, has acted as a strong motivation to further improve the PFM system. Although, like other
strands of public sector reform, PFM reform efforts lost some impetus in the aftermath of Kosovo's
declaration of independence, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to further strengthen the PFM
system by setting up an inter-ministerial working group supported by a dedicated secretariat in late
2008. The Government chose to conduct a new PEFA assessment specifically to take stock of progress
or regress made since the previous assessment and identify priority areas for further improvement.
Indeed, the Government conducted the PEFA self-assessment with the explicit purpose of informing the
preparation of a PFM Reform Action Plan that would focus on addressing the key weaknesses of the
Kosovo PFM system. The recent PEFA self-assessment underlines some improvements in the PFM
system (e.g. in budget credibility, budget classification) as well as some areas of deterioration (e.g. tax
administration). However, it clearly concurs with the PEFA assessment of 2007 in identifying the key
weaknesses of the Kosovo PFM system. The May 2008 SIGMA report on Public Expenditure
Management System recommended strengthening and simplifying budget preparation processes and
further strengthening the linkages and alignment of the Public Investment Programme (PIP) with
budget processes.

132.    The main weaknesses of the Kosovo PFM system relate to budget planning and
formulation, which ­ in large part ­ stem from inadequate strategic planning and central policy
coordination capacity. Kosovo still lacks a national strategic plan, which would inform the allocation
of budgetary resources among different sectors of government activity. After weak internal cohesion
and central coordination capacity led to the previous Government abandoning work on a national plan
in 2007, the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) served as the focus of efforts to
coordinate various sectoral policies and define overall Government priorities. In the absence of a
comprehensive Government strategy, the MEF has had no clear basis for making allocative decisions
among sectors. Therefore, despite the relatively strong position of the MEF vis-à-vis line budget
organizations, the preparation of the MTEF was an essentially bottom-up process, whereby the MEF
would adjust budget organizations' requests to match the available resource envelope. The MTEF
process has also suffered from unreliable forward estimates and insufficient synchronization with the
annual budget process, which have remained the focus of budget organizations. The PFM Action Plan
addresses many of these issues as noted in paragraph 66.

                                                    52
133.    Budget under-execution has also been a key shortcoming of fiscal management in Kosovo
in recent years. Until 2008, overall under-execution was primarily due to difficulties in capital
investment. As a Policy Note prepared by the World Bank in 2007 suggests, these difficulties related to
weak multi-annual planning, and inefficient procurement and contracting practices (e.g. annual
procurement contracts for multi-year projects). An ongoing Bank study indicates that since then the
Public Investment Program (PIP) process has improved, notably through a better synchronization of the
PIP with the MTEF and annual budget processes as well as through the inclusion of municipal projects.
Capacity in some key budget organizations to plan and manage capital investments has also improved.

134.     The new Law on Public Financial Management and Accountability, which came into force
in June 2008, sets a clear budget calendar, which requires the approval of the MTEF to precede
the preparation of the annual budget. On the political side, the incumbent Government, albeit a two-
party coalition like its predecessor, has shown a higher level of internal coherence and discipline
enforced by a more dominant Prime Minister with a clear electoral mandate. This has enabled the
Government to present an identifiable set of policy priorities, primarily transport, education, and
energy, which indeed make up the bulk of public expenditure. These sectoral priorities have contributed
to the sharp increase in capital investment, notably on account of large roads and school construction
programs. At the same time, effective multi-annual budgeting will require significant improvements in
the planning and budget formulation capacity of line budget organizations to ensure that the quality of
their MTEF and budget submissions allows the MEF to make informed decisions based on Government
priorities.

135.     Control environment for foreign exchange in the Central Bank of Kosovo. The IMF has
conducted a Safeguard Assessment of the CBK and the final report is being prepared. As an
alternative, the CBK was requested to submit to IDA the CBK financial statements, audit reports and
accompanying management letters, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, and 2008 for review
by IDA. The World Bank team reviewed the audit reports and noted the auditors issued unqualified
opinion on the CBK financial statements for the three years. No material weaknesses in systems and
controls were identified during the audited period. However, the 5 percent ratio of capital and general
reserve account to the aggregate amount of credit balances of all accounts maintained on the books of
the CBK was not satisfied in the years audited. The Law No. 03/L on the CBK requires the Capital and
General Reserve Account of the Central Bank to be at least five percent of the aggregate amount of the
credit balances of all accounts maintained on the books of the CBK by account holders shown on the
balance sheet of the CBK at the end of each financial year. This 5 percent ratio was not met in years
2006 (3.98 percent), 2007 (3.85 percent) and 2008 (3.31 percent), respectively. Whenever the net profit
of CBK for any financial year is insufficient to increase the capital and general reserve accounts of
CBK to meet the 5 percent requirement, the Ministry of Finance and Economy is required, within one
month after publication of the balance sheet, to make a capital contribution to CBK in such amount or
amounts as shall be necessary to remedy this deficit.

F.      DISBURSEMENT
136.    Legal and Disbursement Arrangements. World Bank Group disbursement procedures for
development policy operations will be followed. The operations will be financed from Grant proceeds,
comprising of $40.0 million IBRD surplus and cofinanced by grants of approximately $56.0 million
from a multi-donor trust fund and financing from USAID. The financing terms and conditions for the
IBRD surplus will be reflected through a Trust Fund Grant Agreement between the Republic of Kosovo
(as Recipient) and IDA, acting as administrator for the IBRD surplus funds; and separate Grant
Agreements between IDA and the Republic of Kosovo in respect of other donor funds. As noted
previously, Kosovo is eligible for an additional SDR 4.3 million on IDA credit terms from the Crisis
Response Window of IDA. This financing is reflected in the Financing Agreement.

                                                  53
137.     The Grant proceeds will be provided as a three year annual programmatic budget support
operation in three roughly equal amounts, for each year of the 3-year program, with the additional IDA
funds from the Crisis Response Window added only to the first of these operations, SEDPO 1, rather
than being spread over the program. SEDPO 1 will be a single tranche operation. As part of the reform
program, specific actions will trigger disbursement of budget support (to be defined in each of the
appraisal documents for the respective disbursements). Upon effectiveness of the Trust-Fund Financed
Grant Agreement and IDA Financing Agreement, the Republic of Kosovo (the Recipient) will submit to
IDA a withdrawal application for the first disbursement. The withdrawal applications for the second
and third disbursements will be submitted after the Bank team has assessed compliance with the actions
specific to those disbursements. In each case, IDA will disburse the Grant and IDA credit proceeds to a
dedicated Government account (deposit account) held at the Central Bank of Kosovo, and which forms
part of the official foreign exchange reserves of the country. The deposit account will be available for
financing budgeted expenditures. The Recipient will ensure that upon deposit of the net proceeds of
the financing into the said account, an equivalent amount will be credited in the Recipient's budget
management system. The Government will confirm to IDA within 30 days, the receipt of each
disbursement, by sending a confirmation letter on the Grant amounts deposited in the foreign currency
accounts and credited to the budget management system. If any of the proceeds of the financing/grant
are used to finance ineligible expenditures as defined in the Financing and Grant Agreements, IDA will
require the Recipient to promptly refund the said amount. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such request
shall be cancelled.

G.       RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

138.     There are several important risks to be noted:

              Kosovo's recent and unexpected fiscal expansion raises questions about medium-term
       macroeconomic stability and risks undermining important reforms, including those supported
       by the SEDPP. Following an estimated budget deficit of 7 percent of GDP for calendar year
       2009, the Government now agreed with the IMF on a revised 2010 budget with a deficit of 3.4
       percent of GDP, with budget support grants expected to cover 40 percent of the deficit. These
       deficits can be financed with the Government's available cash reserves, but there is cause for
       concern about medium-term macroeconomic stability if fiscal expansion were to continue. The
       Bank is already working closely with the IMF and other key external partners (e.g., EC and
       USAID) and has engaged the Government in a constructive dialogue to address fiscal issues and
       is committed to continuing this effort. The IMF SBA will help mitigate these risks over the next
       18 months, as the Government has made commitments on its macroeconomic framework to the
       IMF.
              Spillover effects of the global financial crisis could destabilize the economy and hinder
       government initiatives in WB-supported areas. While the effects of the crisis on Kosovo were
       somewhat limited until about mid-2009, recent months have seen a decline in exports and FDI as
       well as a tightening of credit which could risk lowering domestic consumption and public
       revenues. Moreover the timeliness of reforms could be adversely affected ­ e.g., the impact of
       the crisis on short-listed bidders for the energy project could slow down the comprehensive
       energy sector reform initiated by Government. While the World Bank cannot have much impact
       on economic conditions, it can - and is - helping the Government to continue towards identified
       development goals by adjusting strategies to accommodate changing circumstances.
              Kosovo's governance and political structures are new and fragile and institutions are still
       being developed. Kosovo's young and relatively untested institutions render it potentially
       vulnerable to domestic unrest and political pressures. Moreover, Kosovo's governance systems
       still lack full transparency and accountability, although there have been improvements in recent


                                                   54
years. Governance and political developments will need to be closely followed as related
problems could undermine external development support activities.
      Kosovo's limited capacity in program implementation and monitoring and evaluation pose
risks to the execution of WB-supported initiatives, including the technical assistance required
to complete the ambitious PFM Reform Action Plan and the Employment Strategy. Given
Kosovo's relative unfamiliarity with complex Bank procedures and requirements there is a risk of
slow program execution. In addition, the absence of trained staff for monitoring and evaluation of
development programs could impede appropriate decision making, thereby delaying timely
implementation of development programs, including IDA- financed projects. The recent delay in
Parliamentary approval of two technical assistance projects is just an example of the potential
delays which can be anticipated. To mitigate these risks, the World Bank is providing Kosovan
officials with training in key implementation areas (e.g., procurement and financial management),
and other donors are also helping to build necessary capacity. Broad donor coordination will be
necessary to support the domestic institutions.
      Specific elements of the program, such as the pay and grading of core civil servants, may
not progress satisfactorily. Pay and grading reforms for civil service are always politically
sensitive and could prove to be so in Kosovo. The flexibility in the programmatic approach will
allow the program to accommodate a slower pace of reform if necessary.
      Similarly, political demands for more benefits financed by labor taxes may make it
difficult for the authorities to balance the need for maintaining a conducive framework for
employment generation against the need to satisfy political demands. Working with the
authorities to provide ample public information explaining why some actions are being taken and
why others are being postponed should help alleviate these issues.

IMF Executive Board Approves  108.9 Million 18-Month Stand-By
Arrangement for the Republic of Kosovo
Press Release No. 10/300
July 21, 2010
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved an 18-month
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) for the Republic of Kosovo in a sum equivalent to SDR 92.656
million (about 108.9 million, or US$ 139.6 million), or 157 percent of its quota in the Fund. An
initial disbursement equivalent to SDR 18.760 million (about  22.1 million, or US$ 28.3 million)
is available immediately, with subsequent disbursements subject to quarterly reviews.
Kosovo became the 186th member of the IMF on June 29, 2009. Prior to that, Fund staff had
provided technical assistance and policy advice to the United Nations Mission in Kosovo, and,
since 2008, to the Republic of Kosovo.
Following the Executive Board's discussion of Kosovo, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
"Kosovo's economic performance has strengthened in recent years, although large fiscal and
external imbalances persist, which could be exacerbated by considerable capital spending,
including for the country's first major highway. Against this background, the authorities'
commitment to a comprehensive policy program that aims to lay the foundation for restoring
fiscal sustainability and to safeguard financial sector stability is, therefore, most welcome.
"The program seeks to raise revenues and restrain current expenditures in order to limit the
impact of large capital spending on the fiscal deficit and on the government's bank balances. To
this end, the Assembly recently revised the 2010 budget and raised excise rates.
"The authorities are committed to improving tax administration, refraining from unfunded
spending initiatives, and ensuring the credibility of the budget process by revising future
budgets exclusively in a deficit-neutral fashion. Disciplined implementation of these policies will
help ensure sound public finances over the medium term.
"An important objective of the Fund-supported program is to shore up the government's bank
balances to a prudent level in order to provide an adequate fiscal reserve and funds for
emergency liquidity assistance to the banking system, if this is needed. The timely privatization
of PTK, the post and telecom operator, will help replenish bank balances and ensure that deficit
financing will not rely on short-term commercial borrowing.
"To effectively address quasi-fiscal risks, the authorities intend to devise a strategy to improve
energy sector finances in order to phase out the need for continued budget transfers. To further
protect against contingent fiscal liabilities, the authorities recognize the importance of
safeguarding the fiduciary responsibilities of the pension fund and of avoiding undue exposure
by this fund to a single borrower.
"Kosovo's financial system has weathered the global financial crisis relatively well, and will be
further strengthened by improving crisis preparedness. In this context, the revised central bank
law allows for the extension of emergency liquidity assistance, if needed, and the authorities
intend to draw up regulations that will operationalize the provision of such assistance, while
limiting moral hazard."
                                                                                            ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
A decade after the end of the conflict that led to Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence
in February 2008, growth prospects continue to be hampered by profound structural
impediments. These include poor public and private infrastructure, unreliable electricity supply,
and inadequate regional connectivity of transportation routes.



                                                 66
The economy remains undiversified and dominated by the trade and services sectors that are
boosted by the large foreign presence and remittances. The export base is narrow and
dominated by low value-added products, and a sector that could drive sustainable growth has
yet to emerge. Public expenditure has increased due in part to rising subsidies and net lending
to the publicly-owned loss-making electricity company KEK, which remains under severe
financial strain as a result of widespread difficulties with billings and collections, and a tariff
structure that does not ensure cost recovery.
Nevertheless, economic activity appears to be strengthening and the recession in Europe in
2009 had only a modest impact on Kosovo's economy. Following a contraction last year, exports
have been rebounding so far in 2010 and remittances--an essential source of funding for private
sector activity--have also been recovering.
However, private sector credit growth continues to decelerate. Public spending, especially for
capital investments, has supported economic activity. Real growth therefore declined only
moderately to 4 percent in 2009, from 5.4 in 2008. Public investment spending is expected to
increase in 2010, mainly due to the beginning of the construction of the Route 7 corridor,
Kosovo's first highway.
Program Summary
The key objective of the authorities' economic program is to lay the foundation for restoring
fiscal sustainability and to safeguard financial stability by:
· Exercising restraint in current spending and raise revenues to contain the impact of their large
capital investment program on the overall fiscal deficit;
· Securing substantial budget financing from privatization to preserve debt sustainability;
· Pursuing reforms to broaden the tax base and strengthen public financial management;
· Bolstering the government's bank balances with the Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo
(CBK) to provide scope for emergency liquidity assistance (ELA), if needed;
· Providing the CBK with a mandate for ELA, affirm its independence, and further strengthen the
banking system; and
· Improving the financial position of the energy sector.
