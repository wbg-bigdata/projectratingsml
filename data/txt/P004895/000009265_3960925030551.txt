LOAN S-17 AL - WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PRUFACE
This report reviews the preparation, implementation and achievements
of the Water Supply Engineering Project (Loan S-17 AL) in Algeria, for which a
loan of US$5 million was made to the Government of Algeria.   the loan was
signed in February 1980, becpme effective in September 1980 and was closed at
the end of 1984. The project was implemented by the Ministry of Hydraulics.
The Water Supply Engineering Project was the first Bank-financed
operation  in  the water  supply sector.   Prior to that, the Bank had made
Loan 1545-AL of US$82 million for sewerage works in Algiers, the nation's
capital  and  largest  city.   The  objective of the Water Supply Engineering
Project was to prepare a master plan for the exploitation of water r-sources
in the Algiers Region. A first construction stage of this plan is currently
under execution, partly financed by Loan 2461-AL of US$290 million.
The completion report was discussed with the Ministry of Hydraulics
during a mission in February 1986.   The data presented in the report were
provided by the Ministry of Hydraulics.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance audit
reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report to
the Borrower and Executing Agency for comments.  Comments from the Borrower have
been reproduced as Attachment A to the report.

LOAN S-17 AL - WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETiON REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       Loan S-17 AL of US$5 million was made to the Government of Algeria in
January 1980 to help finance a US$7 million water supply engineering project
for Algiers, the capital city and largest urban agglomeration. Prior to this
loan, the Bank had made Loan 1545-AL of US$82 million for sewerage works in
Algiers. As part of the sewerage project, an evaluation of the existing water
works in the Algiers area was carried out. It showed that water services in
titat area were very deficient and that the water supply systems needed to be
improved and expanded urgently. This evaluation led to the formulation of the
water supply engineering project, with the objectives of preparing a master
plan for water resources in the Algiers/Sebaou area and a phased program of
works to meet urban water demand in Greater Algiers through the year 2010.
2.       The project was successfully implemented and its objectives  fully
achieved. A water supply master plar. was established for the Algiers/Sebaou
area  and  approved  by  the  Government.   A  construction  project  for  the
improvement and expansion of water supply services in Greater Algiers was
defined  and  is  currently  under  implementation.   This  project  is  partly
financed  by  Loan 2461-AL of  US$290 million made  in  September 1984.   As a
result of the engineering project, the Ministry of Hydraulics, which was the
executing   agency,   has  greatly   improved   its  management  and  planning
capabilities.
3.       There were some delays  in appointing consultants  for  the  studies
included in the project.   Consequeatly,  the project execution took a year
longer than anticipated at appraisal.  In subsequent projects, the Ministry of
Hydraulics has made major efforts to accelerate the selection and appointment
of consultants ane contractors.



DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
LOAN S-17 AL - WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. NUTRODUCTION
1.01     The Bank's involvement in the water supply and sewerage sector in
Algeria started  in 1976 with  the preparation of a  sewerage  project  for
Algiers,  the capital city and largest urban agglomeration.   This was some
k fteen years after the country's independence in 1962.  During those years,
the urban population had grown considerably. The Algiers' population, which
in 1962 was about 500,000, had reached 1.5 million in 1976. However, in spite
of this tremendous population increase, no major improvement and extension of
the city's infrastructure, such as water supply and sewerage, had taken
place. There was water shortage in the city. Wastewaters were not evacuated
properly, threatening the public health and environmental conditions.
1.02     To remedy this 3ituation, the Government, with assistance from the
Federal Republic of Germany, prepared in 1977 a master plan for the collection
and disposal of wastewaters and stormwater in the Algiers metropolitan area.
The preparation and implementation of this plan was necessary, as any
i5mmediate increase of the water supply to Algiers, without providing proper
disposal of the generated wastewaters, would have resulted in further
deterioration of environmental conditions in the city. A first construction
stage of  the sewerage master plan is currently under way.   It is partly
financed by Bank Loan 1545-AL of US$82 million. This phase is expected to be
completed by the end of 1987.
1.03     For some time,  the Government was also preoccupied with the water
supply situation in Algiers. In 1978, it was estimated that only 60 percent
of  the  city's  population  had  continuous  water  service.   The  per  capita
consumption was about 112 liters/day, 30 percent short of the calculated
demand.   Greater  Algiers  was  drawing  its water  supply  from  the Mitidja
Groundwater Aquifer also used for irrigation in the rich agricultural valley
surrounding  Algiers.   No  further  increase  of  groundwater  production  was
feasible and a new water source had to be tapped for the city.
1.04     In October 1978, the Government requested the Bank's assistance  in
preparing a master plan of water resources in the Algiers/Sebaou area. The
plan had to co-er the use of the resources for both urban supply and
irrigation.  In priority, a first construction stage of urban water works had
to be defined to allow quick improvement of the water supply situation in
Algiers.

U. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
OrCin, Preparation and Apprab
2.01     Prior to the Water Supply Enginieering Project, there existed various
feasibility studies of water supply to Greater Algiers.   The Bank,  in the
course of the appraisal of the sewerage project (Loan 1545-AL), had also
evaluated the water supply in Algiers and concluded that the city's water
supply had to be increased to meet current and future demand.  None of the
previous studies, however, was considered complete enough to permit the
formulation of a comprehensive water master plan in the Algiers area.
2.02     In October 1978, the Government requested the Bank's assistance  in
preparing this plan. The project was identified in May 1979 and appraised two
months later.  Given the nature of the project, no separate appraisal report
was prepared.  The terms of reference for the studies were prepared by the
Ministry of Hydraulics and reviewed by the Bank.
Project escNription
2.03     The project provided teLhnical assistance to the Government for:
(i)    the carrying out of studies to assess uiban,  industrial and
agricultural   water   requirements   in  Greater  Algiers   and
surrounding areas within a radius of about a hundred miles from
Algiers City;
(ii)    the elaboration of a master plan for the collection and use of
water resources in the project area, including a phased program
of works to meet the above water requirements through the
year 2010;
(iii)    the formulation of a master plan of potable water diPtribution
in the Algiers metropolitan area; and
(iv)    the  preparation of  detailed  designs,  construction  plans  and
tender documents for a first construction stage of works for
Greater Algiers.
2.04     The cost of the studies was estimated at US$7 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$5 million. The project was scheduled to be completed
by the end of 1983. No study of the water supply sector and organization in
the Algiers area was included in the project. This was part of the sewerage
project financed under Loan 1545-AL.
Negotiations and Approval
2.05     Negotiations for a Bank loan of US$5 million to finance the foreign
exchange cost of the project were held in Washington, D.C. from November 13 to



-3-
19,  1979.   Agreement  was  quickly  reached  on  the  project  contents  and
objectives, except for a possible future refinancing of the loan.  As usual,
the Bank had proposed that the technical assistance loan should be refinanced
under any future loan for a construction project which would have arisen out
of  the  technical  assistance.   The  Algerian  Delegation  objected  to  that
proposal on the gr.iunds that it would commit Algeria to accept refinancing of
the loan on future unknown cond'tions, which might not be as acceptable as the
current ones. The Bank agreed to drop the proposed refinancing.
2.06     The  loan was  approvred  by  the  Board  on  January  15,  1980.   The
agreement   was   signed   on   Februa.ry 14, 1980   and   became  effective   on
September 17, 1980. There was no special condition of effectiveness.
Loan Covenants
2.07     The  Ministry  of  Hydraulics  was  put  in  charge  of  the  project
execution. In addition, the following main covenants were set out in the Loan
Agreement:
(i)    The Borrower had to employ consultants acceptable to the Baik,
under   terms   and   conditions   satisfactory   to   the   Bank
(Section $.02(a));
(ii)    All  documents  related  to  the  project  and  prepared  by  the
consultants had to be submitted for the Bank review and comments
(Section 3.02(d));
(iii)    The Borrower had to review with the Bank the conclusions and
recommendations of the studies (Section 3.02(e)).
]H. PROJECT IMPLEILENTATION AND COST
Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-Up
3.01     There  was  no  special  condition  of  effectiveness.   Only  the
Government's formal ratification of the Loan Agreement was  required.   The
original deadline of June 17, 1980 for declaring the loan effectiveness was
extended to September 30 to provide the Government with additional time to
complete  the  ratification  process.   The  loan  was  declared  effective  on
September 17, 1980.
3.02     Meanwhile, in November 1979, the Ministry of Hydraulics had invited
seven groutps of engineering consulting firms to submit proposals for the
studies. The list of selected firms was reviewed and approved by the Bank.
Only four groups effectively presented proposals for the studies at the end of
1979.



-4-
Proiect Execution
3.03     It was originally foreseen that the project execution would start in
April 1980. A period of four months was allocated fort the evaluation by the
Ministry of Hydraulics of the consultants' proposals.  Actually, it took the
Ministry more than a year to evaluate  the proposals.   The evaluation was,
however,  thoroughly done and very objective.   Perhaps the time allowed at
appraisal was too short and the evaluation process judged too easy under the
Algerian administrative procedures. A group of engineering firms was selected
in April 1981, a year later than originally scheduled.   The selection was
approved by the Bank.
3.04     Overall, the project execution was carried out diligently.  The Loan
Agreement provided that the project would be completed by mid-1983. Actually,
the studies were completed in June 1984, reflecting the original delays in
appointing the consultants. The late completion of the studies, however, had
no effect on the first objective of the project, which was to formulate a
construction project fo" Greater Algiers. A feasibility study of the proposed
works was ready in June 1983 and provided the basis of a water supply project
for  Greater  Algiers.    In  June 1984,   the  Bank  made  Loan 2461-AL  of
US$290 million for this project.
Consultant Selection and Procurement
3.05     In  selecting  the  consultants  for  the  studies,  the  Ministry  of
Hydraulics followed the Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants.   Its
selection  of  a  British  consortium was approved by the Bank.
Project Costs
3.06     Actual and estimated project costs are compared below:
Local   Foreign   Total        Local   Foreign   Total
..... DA  Million .....        ..... US$ Million 
Actual Costs              14.81    17.27    32.08          3.09      3.61     6.70
Appraisal Estimates        7.50    18.75    26.25          2.00     5.00      7.00
Ir.crease (Decrease)       7.31    (1.48)    5.83          1.09    (1.39)   (0.30)
Increase (Decrease) %    97.5      (7.9)    22.2          54.5    (27.8)    (4.3)
Overall,  the total project cost  in US dollars  decreased  by  US$300,000  or
4.3 percent  below  the  original  estimates.   The  cost  in Algerian  Dinars,
however, increased by DA5.83 million or 22.2 percent over the appraisal
estimates.   This  resulted  from a 28-percent appreciation of the US dollar
vis-a-vis  the  Algerian  dinar  during  the  project  execution  period.   The
exchange rate, which was US$1 for DA 3.75 at appraisal and which was assumed
to remain constant during the project implementation, fluctuated to an average



of US$1 for DA 4.80. The decrease in the foreign component also stemmed from
the appreciation of the US dollar vis-a-vis the pound sterling which was the
currency  used  to  pay  the  consultants.   In  addition,  some  analysis  and
laboratory tests originally planned to be made outside Algeria, were effected

Only US$3.61 million of the loan amount was used for the project.
The balance of US$1.39 million was cancelled. To provide sufficient time for
the completion of the studies following the late start of the project
execution, the closing date was extended b- one year to December 31, 1984.
Reporti
3.08     Quarterly progress reports were submitted regularly and on a timely
fashion to the Bank.   During the project  implementation,  the Ministry  of
Hydraulics as well as the consultants reviewed with the Bank the findings and
conclusions of the studies.   All the reports and documents related to the
project were submitted to the Bank.
Con=ltants' Performance
3.09     It is the Ministry of Hydraulics'  view that the consultants have
accomplished a satisfactory work.   The Bank concurs  with  this  view.   The
consultants' studies were used to specify water works for Greater Algiers;
their construction is currently under way. The Ministry of Hydraulics and the
consultants maintained good relations during the project implementation.
N. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Achievements
4.01     The project was conceived to formulate a water supply master plan for
the Algiers/Sebaou Region and to propose new water works for Greater Algiers.
This objective was fully achieved. The studies have led to the formulation of



the Algiers Regional Water Supply Project for which the Bank made Loan 2461-AL
of US$290 million in 1984.  This project is under construction and scheduled
for completion at the end of 1987. The studies also defined a second stage of
water works to be built for Greater Algiers. A detailed design of this stage
would be soon undertaken.
4.02     The master plan also covered the use of the water resources in the
project area for irrigation.  Current laud development and planning of these
resources follow the sequence set out in the consultants' studies.   In this
regard, the project was instrumental in strengthening the planning and
technical capabilities of the Ministry of Hydraulics.
Bank Performance
4.03     At the time the project was appraised,  water services  in Greater
Algiers were deteriorating. No plan was available to improve these services.
A major achievement of the project was to outline the measures necessary to
restructure the city's water works. A construction project was formulated and
is currently under way. Through the project, the Ministry of Hydraulics has
also considerably  strengthened  its planning capability.   The studies have
allowed the Ministry of Hydraulics to establish an appropriate long-term
development program for water resources in an important region of the
country. The Bank strongly urged the undertaking of the study and is very
supportive of the resulting master plan and development program.
4.04     The  project execution was supervised regularly.   From the project
start to completion, a total of nine supervision missions visited Algiers.  It
should be noted that always as part of these missions, the Algiers Sewerage
Project (Loan 1545-AL) was supervised together with the preparation of the
Algiers Regional Water Supply Project (Loan 2461-AL). The missions' advice
and follow-up letters contributed in improving the quality of the studies.
The Ministry of Hydraulics is pleased with the project's results and the
Bank's performance during the project implementation.
V. CONCLUSIONS
5.01     The project was successfully implemented.  Its objectives were fully
achieved. A construction project of new water works for the metropolitan area
of Algiers was defined and is under implementation.   Once this project is
completed,  water  services  in  the  Algiers  area  are  expected  to  improve
considerably.   Greater Algiers is surrounded by rich cultivable land.  The
project has defined the works to undertake to increase irrigation and
agricultural production in the area.   The Ministry of Hydraulics has also
greatly  improved  its  management  and  planning  procedures   through   the
preparation and implementation of the project.
5.02     The studies were completed with a small delay due to the late start
of the project execution. Much time was taken by the Ministry of Hydraulics
to evaluate the consultants' proposals and select a consulting firm.
Subsequently, the Ministry and the Bank have devoted considerable efforts to

improve and speed up evaluation processes in other Bank-financed projects. In
spite of the original delays, the expected construction project for Greater
Algiers was, however, formulated on schedule and is now under implementation.
