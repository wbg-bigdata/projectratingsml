1.    Introduction
The Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project (EMSRP) would mitigate the
deterioration of basic municipal services due to the support of local government efforts for
sustaining essential municipal services, and provide temporary labor-intensive employment
opportunities to diminish the growth in poverty in urban population centers due to risiig
unemployment as a result of the ongoing crisis and closures of the Palestinian territories, i.e.
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Potential negative impacts that are localized and limited in nature will be avoided by
providing instructions in the contract document which specifically address environimlental
issues in a manner acceptable to the Bank, as well as following Good Management Practices
during construction and service delivery given the above justification, this project is
categorized as a "B" project in accordance with the World Bank Operational Policy 4.01
(January 1998) and requires the preparation and implementation of an Environmental
Management Plan (EMP). The ministry of Local Government commissioned the Engineering
and Management Consulting Center (EMCC) to prepare the Environmental Management Plan
(EMP) for the (EMSRP) to satisfy the World Bank Operational Policy 4.01 (January 1998).
The key implementing agencies involved in the project are the Local Government Units
(LGUs) with over all monitoring and funds management by the project steering committee
chaired by MOLG with membership of Ministry of Finance (MOF) and Ministry of Planning
and Interinational Cooperation (MOPIC).
2.    EMSRP Background
The project will mainly support in activities that support rehabilitation and improvements of
existing infrastructure and service delivery and provide improved and systematic operational
and maintenance systems.
2.1 EMSRP Objectives:
The main objectives of the proposed project are:
*  Mitigating further deterioration in the quality and coverage of municipal services,
particularly solid waste collection, electricity, water and sanitation services,
*  Generating temporary employment opportunities for unemployed workers who have
lost jobs inside Israel or due to the economic contraction in WBG, and
*  Introducing a mechanism - a municipal fund to link central and local government
budgetary planning process to strengthen Palestinian emergency response capacity,
enhance mobilization of donor assistance, and improve the efficiency and equity of
resource transfers to local government.
2.2 EMSRP Components:
The project consists of the following components:
1-    Emergency Program Assistance
* Local government service expenditures
* Labor intensive employment generation
* Damage repair to facilities and infrastructure

* Project coordination unit
* Municipal fund management agent contract
111-  Technical assistance and capacity building
This proposed emergency project, would contribute to environmental improvements by
sustaining municipal service quality and coverage, including solid waste collection and
management, and wastewater services, among other local community identified priorities
A limited number of small physical labor-intensive works sub-projects are expected to be
financed under the project depending on demand. Given that most of the likely investment
activities would support rehabilitation and improvements to existing infrastructure and
service delivery with a sub-project value that may not exceed US$150,000 and would not
require land acquisition or resettlement.
3.    Objectives and Features of the EMP
The main features of the EMP are an audit of randomly selected rehabilitation and
maintenance projects and an assessment of potential impacts and mitigation measures. Based
on the audit and assessment of sample projects of similar nature to the EMSRP projects, an
EMP is prepared highlighting the following elements:
* Site-specific environmental screening review and assessment of key environmental
issues through an environmental audit of similar projects and regular maintenance and
rehabilitation of essential infrastructure.
* Ensure adequate consultation during the assessment process.
* Develop an Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan.
4.    Projects Description and Audit Process
The EMP will give general guidance on environmental issues, as well as on site assessments
and designs that will be prepared for the infrastructure to be rehabilitated and improved under
this project. The EMP will also elaborate on potential environmental impacts and recommend
mitigation measures. The need for mitigation measures is likely to be limited. If any, the costs
would be financed out of the allocation provided to local government units through their
emergency program assistance.
4.1 Projects Description
In close coordination with the World Bank project team and MOLG, sample projects of the
Emergency Services and Supporting Program (ESSP) and other projects (ERP-2, CDP-II,
ERSP, and EJCP) were selected to be used for the environmental audit. The selected projects
include inplemented and under construction projects (i.e. during construction and post
construction phases). The list of these projects is shown in Table (1). Brief description full
details of these projects are given in annex (11). The assessed and audited projects were
selected to cover the different maintenance and rehabilitation activities and sectors (roads and
pavement, water supply networks, wastewater services, buildings, electricity, and solid
waste).
Table (1) below summarizes the selected projects for environmental audit.

Note:
Several projects were impleniented under the ESSP project and include:
* Cleaning of wastewater networks, storm water networks and storm water pools
* Supply of fuel, goods and spare parts for cars
*   Construction of water wells
*   Payment for some municipalities for electricity bills.
'I'he EMSRI' project is proposed to include these components in addition to; supply the municipalities with solid
waste transportation vehicles and trucks for general municipal maintenance services and similar components of'
ESSP, so the study discussed these issues.
Significant benefits would accrue to the population. Women and children as well as all
community categories would benefit from       the proposed (EMSRP) project componlents.
Benefits would include:
*   Improvement in the efficiency of water supply service delivery by further reducing
leakage and increasing the capacity of the systems in terms of quality and quantity.
*   Support the municipalities to decrease their liabilities of water, electricity and solid
waste collection and disposal, this will be achieved due to the proposed project
components; i.e. payment of municipal services bills owed to suppliers.
*   Improvement of sanitation services by rehabilitation of existing deteriorated networks
and receiving more reliable services. The efficiency of wastewater and storm water
networks will be improved due to cleaning activities of pipes, manholes, gutters and
other facilities related to wastewater and storm water.
*   Improvement in public health and environmental conditions due to expansion and
rehabilitation of water networks, wastewater collection services and solid waste
collection and transportation services.
*   Improvement in roads by maintaining the pavement and removing disturbances to road
users.
*   Maintenance of electricity poles and street lighting facilitates the night movement of
peoples and reduce the risks of accidents.
*   Opportunities  for local private    sector participation  and  development through
consulting, contracting, working and manufacturing inputs throughout the project
period.
*   Employment generation to unemployed skilled and unskilled laborers.

4.2 Audit Process and Methodology
In order to prepare the EMP and achieve its objectives, the consultant carried out the
following activities:
4.2.1 Data Collection
o  Collect and review all existing studies conducted on the environmental situation
in West Bank and Gaza - specifically the environmental profiles, the
Environmental Strategy and Action Plan, the EMPs prepared under the World
Bank financed Community Development Projects and the Emergency Services
Support Projects.
Li Reviewing the environmental laws, strategies and actions plan that were adopted
by the Environmental Quality Authority (EQA).
Li lnformation on the environmental attributes of the study area. Infrastructure,
transportation links, and utilities are documented from  available reports
produced by PECDAR, MOPIC, PWA, and EQA.
o Along with the background review, the assessment is based on field survey, site
visits, interviews, and discussion with relevant local administrative bodies
(LGUs) to explore current practices in rehabilitation and maintenance activities.
Site visits to the selected project were carried out to document the main features
and impacts of each project on the environmental components. Photos were also
taken to different locations of the projects.
4.2.2 Impact Assessment
o  The study team selected nine sample projects and conducted the environmental
audit and assessed the environmental impacts of the projects. The projects were
selected to cover the under-construction and post-construction stages. The
sample projects as shown in Table (1) cover the main sectors of infrastructure
and municipal services; i.e. water projects, wastewater, storm water, solid waste,
and road maintenance.
o The potential impacts of each project / sector were described and evaluated for
the construction and post-construction stages of the project in order to identify
the mitigation measures.
The mitigation measures for the negative impacts for each audited project is
presented as shown in Table (2).
4.2.3 EM\I Development
Based on the collected data and reports, site visits, interviews with involved staff and
consultant's experience, the consultant team developed the Environmental Management
Plan (EMP) for the proposed EMSRP, which includes feasible and cost effective
measures to minimize or mitigate negative impacts and the actions to be adopted during
the screening process and implementation phases of the project. Also, the EMP was
prepared to integrate environmental concerns into the design and implementation of the
proposed projects. The EMP includes three basic components; institutional component,
environmental mitigation, and environmental monitoring.

5. General Findings
5.1 Environmental Positive Impacts
Through the auditing and assessment process of projects it is expected that the impacts of the
proposed EMSRP project will be mainly positive environmental impacts for most sectors.
Positive impacts identified include the following:
Sewage and Water Projects:
Sewage and water projects improve the public health of the local community and
ground water protection.
* Sewage and Water Projects Construction
After construction, the implemented projects will have no impacts on most
of the physical environment factors such as noise, dust, and air pollution.
Water projects will improve the quality and quantity of water and ensure
more system efficiency. The rehabilitation and maintenance of water
networks will also reduce the losses due to water leakage and illegal house
connections. Sewage projects will improve the health conditions, reduce
leakage and have positive impact on the ground water.
* Cleaning of Networks.
The cleaning of wastewater and storm water networks have a positive
impact in terms of less storm water collection in winter seasons and less
flooding of polluted water on the streets. This project has another advantage
where more laborers will be involved within the projects activities. Cleaning
activities ensure more sustainable facilities and higher operation standards.
* Supply Tools and Equipments
Such projects improve the capacities of municipal staff and enable them to
carry out their tasks with less time and in safe environment. The provisions
of sewer cleaning equipment will adequately maintain the flow capacity of
the sewers and will prevent damage during the cleaning operation.
Road Maintenance and Re-pavement Projects:
Reduce or prevent dust, improve drainage, minimize disturbances and obstacles and
ensure road safety, especially in roads close to schools and markets. Pavement and
sidewalks add positively to the people's attitude towards preserving these assets and
therefore keeping their localities clean and safe. Al Majaida Area in Khan Younis was
much imiproved in terms of features and accessibility and well received by the
community.
Rehabilitation of Buildings
Generally, the rehabilitation of schools, clinics, public centers or municipal buildings
is proposed to increase the capacity of employees and improve the work environment.
Building maintenance projects improve the physical conditions of the structures and
improve safety conditions.
-  Solid waste projects
Solid waste management practices ensure natural resources protection, fewer and safer
disposal sites, clean environment and minimization of environmental, cultural, social,
and economic effects. The proposed activities of this sector will increase the efficiency
of collection system and control illegal dumping sites. Tools and equipment will aid

the LGUs regarding cleaning of streets and thus improve the health conditions. The
containers with different sizes and trucks or collection vehicles will improve the
conditions of transportation fleets at the LGUs and collection of solid wastes;
accumulation of wastes in roads and residential areas will be minimized or eliminated.
The monitoring of illegal dumping sites, which are close to residential areas, will
minimize the negative environmental impacts.
-  Electricity
Improvement of electricity services is expected due to maintenance and replacemelit of
the old un-isolated electricity cables with new isolated ones. Old cables became
deteriorated and subjected to cutting in winter and windy seasons. So, the electricity
services will be improved mainly during the peak periods. Relocation of old electricity
poles will improve the traffic condition in heavy populated areas.
The project will supply the LGU with necessary street lighting fixtures, which have
positive impacts on accessibility and minimization of accidents and risks.
5.2 Socioeconomic Positive Impacts
Economical benefits are gained in sewage, building and road pavement projects as short-term
job opportunities for local skilled and unskilled laborers. Generally, positive impacts are
gained from all projects in terms of employment generation, more efficient services provision,
sustainable development and environmental protection. Since September 2000, (the beginning
of Al Aqsa Intifada) the social and economic situation of the Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza has dramatically declined. The most direct economic hardship is the loss of an
estimated 75,000 Palestinian jobs in Israel. Unemployment has jumped and the estimated
percentage of the population living under the poverty rate has increased up to 60%. The
emergency development projects, which were conducted during this period, allocated a
percentage of the projects' budget for employment generation. The ERSP, ERP-2, EJCP and
ESSP enforce the contractors to allocate about 20-30% of the project budget for short-terml
employment opportunities. Such projects as well as the proposed EMSRP project will
improve the economical situation and help in improving their life standards.
The EMSRP is proposed to provide labor-intensive employment opportunities for skilled and
unskilled laborers and it will target sub-projects with a minimum of 60% labor content. The
proposed sub-projects are mainly maintenance activities and cleaning of networks, these
activities require less use of equipment and tools and mainly dependent on workers thus
ensuring more labor involvement.
5.3 Environmental Negative Impacts and Mitigation Measures
The risks and negative impacts of the proposed EMSRP projects can be minimized by
addressing mitigation measures during construction and post-construction operation phases.
Table (2) below summarizes the expected impacts of each sector and the suggested mitigation
measures.

6. Environmental Issues and Baseline Information
The baseline information for Gaza Strip and West Bank considering the environmental issues
listed below are described in details in Annex (111).
c  Climate, Air Quality and Noise.
o  Available Water Resources and Water Quality.
o  Transportation and land use.
O  Vegetations, Wildlife and Marine Life Resources.
o  Agricultural resources.
O  Population and housing.
o  Employment and income.
o  Archaeological resources, Recreation and tourism.
o  Public health.
7.    Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan
This section aims to coordinate the environmental policies, plans and programs and decisions
of the various parties involved in the project, which exercise functions that affect the
environment. The aim is to minimize the duplication of procedures and provide consistency
in the protection of the environment.
Mitigation measures require a successful impact management plan implemented at the correct
time and in the correct way. This usually requires a clearly written and agreed plan of action
for managing impacts so that these are kept within the limits of acceptability. The monitoring
plan describes how and who will carry out the monitoring activities for addressing the
negative environmental issues.
The EMP includes three basic components:
o Institutional Component
o Environmental mitigation
o Environmental monitoring
7.1 Institutional Component
The Institutional Component details out the responsibilities for management, monitoring,
reporting and enforcement. This section should also include any needs for capacity building,
training or equipment.

Environmental Management Plan                                       Final Repo; I
EMRSP
7.1.1 Institutional Overview and Strengthening Needs
MOLG can and should be expected to acquire the institutional and technical capabilities
required to incorporate EMP measures which are integral to the activities which it performs or
for which it has responsibility. The mobilization of other national institutions such as EQA is
necessary. EQA is responsible for the development of the environmental policy, legislation
and environmental planning. It is also responsible for developing standards, normis and
guidelines for creating environmentally sustainable conditions. EQA have acquired the
capacity and strength, which enable EQA staff to be involved in monitoring EMSRP project
activities.
Based on the discussions with key staff from PECDAR and MOLG who where involved
in previous similar projects, the following remarks can be drafted.
*  Some environmental considerations are already included in the contract
documents (e.g. chance of findings, dumping of construction and demolition
wastes, etc.).
*  No cooperation is recorded with EQA    regarding the projects. Only a
representative from the Ministry of Labor visited selected projects to ensure that
safety procedures are observed.
*  Environmental auditing was done in some projects (ERSP and DANIDA EJCP).
*  No training seminars or workshops were conducted for the municipal engineers
or contractors.
7.1.2 Strengthening Environmental Expertise
Environmental expertise will be established within the implementation agencies for the
coordination and supervision of the environmental activities funded through the
EMSRP.
Establishing a Project Coordination Units (PCU) is proposed in order to monitor and
follow up the project implementation activities. The PCU role includes; identify
priorities, establishing criteria for projects selection, approve projects, participate in bids
evaluation, review technical and financial reports as well as daily monitoring, site visits
and supervising of projects implementation. The PCU should also be responsible for
taking the responsibility of monitoring and enforcing the environmental regulations.
Member of the PCU staff should also be designated to coordinate and follow up with
EQA, MOLG, LGUs and the consultant to ensure transfer of knowledge and build up
the MOLG and LGUs capacity. The staff member should be an environmental specialist
or with strong environmental background to participate in the screening and monitoring
processes. The expert would basically do the following:
a- Conduct environmental reviews of sub projects and monitoring
b- Conduct site visits to review progress of and abidance with environmental
measures.
c- Coordinate environmental training activities for staff, engineers and
contractors
Part-tine environmental advisor(s) contracted from local and international firms will
support occasionally the implementing agency staff.
The consultant's role is to assist the PCU and the LGUs in ensuring the quality of all
technical and managerial aspects of the project implementation. The success of the project

can be seen very much dependent on the role of the consultant in co-operation with MLG
and LGUs. The consultant's role could include the following components:
* Technical Auditing:
Monitor the progress of the implementation of sub-projects and ensure that these
projects are implemented with the best practice in terms of quality of the materials
used and in all technical and managerial aspects. This component includes; review
technical specifications, drawings, and bill of quantities for each project and
propose modifications, review the cost estimates to ensure abidance with the
general criteria set for these project, and conduct monthly technical audit.
*  Environmental Auditing:
>  Monitor materials transportation and storage and construction activities.
> Follow up the environmental management plan during construction activities
inside the project area.
> Coordinate with PCU, LGUs, EQA and other involved parties in order to
mitigate the environmental impacts by providing instruction for the
implementing agencies.
>  Site-specific  environmental screening  review  and  assessment of key
environmental issues through an environmental audit of sample projects.
> Preparation of the progress reports which follow-up the implementation of
EMP and recommendations that rise-up during site visits of the sample
projects.
7.1.3 Environmental Capacity Building and Training Program
The training program would be designed and implemented by local or international
consultants in cooperation with EQA. The training would target three levels:
I- On-the-job training of a dedicated PCU to direct activity planning, design, and
implementation with respect to environmental protection.
2- Training for staff of local authorities, municipalities, and village councils. The
training should be provided through short duration seminars and workshops.
Overseas placements and orientation visits, one-month duration, should also be
provided for selected staff members. The overseas trainings and visits will enhance
the long-tern capacity of the LGUs and the MOLG staff.
3- Training for contractors should be provided, including one or two days workshops
for local contractors, focusing on: preparation and use of the appraisal/mitigation
forms, use of environmental guidelines, and implementation of mitigation
measures. Also, they should be trained on safety measures for construction works,
proper waste disposal and cleaning measures during construction.

EMRSP
A comprehensive capacity building program is needed to provide a range of aids that
can be used to engender skill development and knowledge transfer. This can include:
o Developing a library of environmental assessment reports and maintaining
a database of information collected during the assessment;
o Collecting examples of good practice and establishing environmental
awards in the workplace
o Holding an environment 'day' or 'week', inviting guest speakers on
environmental issues,
o Producing desk aids such as a yearly calendar based on environmental
themes and designing corporate environmental posters
7.2 Environmental Mitigation
Environmental mitigation includes a matrix identifying the issues, mitigation measures,
responsibility for carrying out the mitigation measures and the approximate cost estimates for
the actions.
7.2.1   Potential Environmental Impacts, Mitigation Measures and Monitoring
Plan
In order to implement sufficient and adequate EMP in terms of project monitoring,
reporting and supervision, the following actions are recommended:
o  Site-specific environmental screening and review process conducted at least
one time a month for randomly selected projects.
The screening and review process would be conducted in close coordination
with EQA. Environmental review shall be conducted by local experts and
specific projects that have been earmarked will be subjected to detailed site
review and implementation of construction works shall be closely monitored.
A standard appraisal / mitigation form shall be used. The form should
basically include:
a- Current environmental problems such as water supply contamination
at the site, dust and air pollution.
b- Any potential environmental impacts of the project, if any, due to the
project.
c- Mitigation measures.
o Prepare a monthly progress report (Environmental Audit) addressing the
environmental  issues,  status  of  mitigation  measures  taken  and
recommendations.
The projects and activities implemented under EMSRP should be subjected to site
specific environmental assessment and review process. Environmental mitigation
and monitoring actions are presented in a simple matrix format. This includes
identifying the issues, mitigation measures, responsibility for carrying out the
mitigation measures, environmental monitoring, and responsibility for carrying out
the monitoring actions. Table 3 handles these issues in more details.

1.1     Relevant Ministries and Institutions
Ministry of Local Government
Historically, local governmenits have been the cornerstone of Palestinian governance and the key providers of public
goods and services in West Bank and Gaza (WBG) Municipalities, particular, have well-established service delivery
and regulatory functions including electricity, water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, local roads, libraries,
parks and recreation, slaughterhouses, markets, land use planning, building and development approval, and business and
professional licensing Until November 1996 the governmental organization basically consists of two levels central and
local levels In November 1996 a new intermediate level was introduced as Governorate, thus three levels were
establisled. central, regional and local governments. Currently, the local government system of West Bank and Gaza
Strip consists of municipalities and local councils. In the areas outside the municipal boundaries, MOLG is responsible
for project licensinig and approval.
The Palestinian Water Authority
PWA is responsible for the management of available water resources in Palestine to achieve the balance between
available water quantities and qualities, and the needs of the Palestinian people in the present and the future Law No 2
for 1996 identified the role of PWA in the following areas-
1   Strategic planning for the water resources In this context, PWA has the authority to develop, enhance and
allocate the water resources among the various demand sectors in order to achieve its goals which are
0   Find the optimal way to manage. protect, and conserve the limited national water resources
GCuarantee the riyht of access to water of a good quality for both present population and futu/re
generations at cost that thev can afford
2   Monitoring and protection of water resources This is considered as an important role to enable PWA to assess
the existing resources and protect them as a precious resource. PWA has developed a comprehensive
monitoring program. The program identified the needs, the number of monitoring wells and their locations
Also vulnerable areas by different sources of pollution like wastewater treatment plant, industrial estates, ports
and intensive farms were considered carefully [PWA Monitoring, 1998].
3   Rezulation Aiming at maximization of the benefit from the water resources and due to existing conflict of
interests, it is necessary to have a mature regulator for the water sector in general Regulations should organize
the relationship between service providers, users environment and water resources. The role of PWA will be
D   Environmental Regulation  This function of regulation aims at controlling the utilization of water
resources and wastewater disposal and/or reuse in such a manner that enables the environm1ent and
optimizes the benefit.
O   Water Quality Rezulation This function of regulation aims at controlling the drinking water quality In
this context the PWA will be responsible for imposing a set of regulations on the service provider These
regulations should satisfy the requirement of the various stakeholders and mainly the Ministry of Health
(MOH). The PWA has formed a committee that includes the PWA, MOH, Ministry of Environmlental
Affairs and universities in an attempt to set standards for drinking water
o   Economic Regtlation This function of regulation aims at reviewing the prices of water in order to protect
the customer from the service provider, which is normally working in a monopolistic environmenit Also
the regulator should ensure that all cost related activities are performed adequately by the utility

EMSRP                                               Annex - I Guidelines and Regulatory Standards
Labor law No 16 for the year 1964 is the Palestinian Labor Law applicable for West Bank and Gaza Strip Governorates
till a comprehensive law for all Palestine is issued and approved by PLC Labor Law is the reference for work and labor
regulations and different parties rights Workers occupational health and safety is presented thoroughly in the Labor Law
in the following Context.
0   3rd chapter, Ist section contains regulations for workers health and safety. Articles 62 and 63 states that it is
necessary to inform the worker about any danger in his duties before starting the work and take the necessary
measures on the owner expenses
o Article 64 states that workers should not damage or spoil any protection means and has to obey all the
instructions related to workers health and safety Also it is the mandate of labor ministry to monitor factories

of working hours, wages, and disputes resolutions and workers age.
Palestinian Environmental Assessment Policy
According to this policy the proponent of any proposed activity should fill in application for Environmiental Approval to
the Environmental Quality Authority (EQA). Then EQA will notify the appropriate permitting authorities that an
application for environmental approval has been received and that an EIA is required. Stakeholder consultation is
mandatory when undertaking an EIA   In consultation with the proponent and the EA Committee, the Authority
determines what the minimum requirements for stakeholder consultation should be. It may be required during scopiig
and terms-of-reference preparation, and during the conduct of the EIA. At minimum, the proponent must meet with the
principal stakeholders to inform them about the proposed project and to solicit their views about it More problematic
projects should involve more extensive consultations. The methods and results of these consultations must be
documented in the EIA Report.
Draft Law on Local Government
The Ministry of Local Governmient (MOLG) has focused its efforts initially on preparing for national, which were
successfully held in January 1996. It is also actively developing managerial systems and drafting a new local
government law for consideration by the Palestinian Council. It is not yet clear what would be the functions and degree
of autonomy of local governments and their relationship to the central government Two versions of the potential law on
local government have been drafted. One would give local governments substantial autonomy, building on the existing
situation, while the other would confer heavy control to the central government The new law on local government
would add the Higher Planning Council to existing local and central planning committees and would define the roles and
responsibilities of these three planning bodies
o   Local Planning Committee comprised of the president and members of the Municipal Council
D   Central planning Committee comprised of representatives of all ministries and chaired by the Ministry of
Local Government. Although there is one local planning committee for each Governorate, there is only one
central planning committee for all Governorates.
O Local councils: A new law on Palestinian local authorities was promulgated and signed in 1997 The new law
clarifies the roles and responsibilities of local governments in Palestine, including procedures for electing local
councils and presidents of local councils, the roles and responsibilities of local councils and the presidents of
local councils, and fiscal and financial management.

Project Description
El Majaida Area is located at the center of Khan Younis city. The implemented project ained at
developing and paving the interior roads of the area. The unpaved sandy road has been disturbing the
features of the area, causing difficulties for traffic movement and resulting in storm water
accumulation ponds during winter seasons. Dust generated by traffic over the unpaved road has been
causing air pollution problems in the area. In addition, the previous conditions of the road have
caused heavy traffic movement on other paved roads of the Camp. The above reasons made the
development of this road necessary. . The development of the roads was highly appreciated by the
local community and surroundings where the project solved their problems.
The project work included:
o   lmprovement the water network and installing new house connections.
o  670Gm2 of Interlock for the following roads;
* El Majaida road which connects El Bahr Street with Mahros Fares Street. The street was an
unpaved sandy street causing dust problems and flooding of storm water in the rainy
seasons.
* Natheir El Farra Street, which connects with Jamal Abd El Naser Street. The street was an
unpaved sandy street causing clogging of storm water network at Jamal Abd El Naser Street
* El Qedra Street, which was sandy street that connects with El Bahar Street.
The roads also connect tributary roads and a lot of small passages between residential houses.
Project Objectives
* The pavement of the roads provides safe access for the people and children
*  The project solved the problem of storn water flooding and clogging of the main
networks.
* Improvement of the aesthetic view of the area.
*  Improvement of health and environmental conditions.

Project Description
Due to the closure of the main roads in Gaza Strip during the period of Al Intifada, the
municipalities are unable to dispose the generated solid waste into the landfills. The
municipality of Bait Hanoun has a landfill in the northern part of Gaza Strip; no body can reach
the landfill site. Therefore, the municipality transports all solid wastes generated in the village
to Gaza landfills. The drivers and solid waste collectors used to use an open space of land at the
entrance of the city illegally and dispose of the wastes there. The municipality worked hard to
prevent this illegal dumping and worked to transfer the wastes to the eastern part of the city
where a land plot has been leveled for the citizens of the city. The citizens requested the
munLicipality to dispose of the wastes in this land plot, which will save the leveling costs. Direct
dumping, without any processing of the land before dumping, was made. Covering layers of
sand and Kurkar were used to cover the wastes. About 2,000 ton of wastes were transported.
The project included the following components:
* Removal of solid waste from Bait Hanoun's entrance to a dumping site inside the
village.
* Supply 15 solid waste containers (Im3)
* Supply tools for solid waste collection and cleaning.
Project Objectives
*  Improve the aesthetic features of the area and improve the view of the city entrance.
* Increase the efficiency of solid waste collection and cleaning services.
* Control the illegal dumping in open areas.
