MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF ALBANIA
FOR A RURAL ROADS PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendations on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Albania for SDR 10.1 million (US$ 15.00
million equivalent), on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity, to help finance a Rural
Roads Project. The project would be cofinanced by an Italian Lira 24.80 billion (US$ 15.00
million equivalent) untied loan from Italy. Five maps (IBRD Nos. 26231, 26232, 26233, 26234,
and 26725) are attached.
2.    Economy. Since the presentation of the last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), Albania
has continued to emerge from the deep social and economic crisis that accompanied the collapse
of communism in 1990-92. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew more than 10 percent in 1993
and 7 percent in 1994, and inflation declined from a peak annualized rate of 30 percent in mid-
1993 to less than 1.6 percent in 1994. The macroeconomic program supported by the IMF and
the World Bank remains on track. Substantial remittances from abroad, coupled with the income
created by the newly-emerging private sector, has fueled an extraorainary expansion in demand
and associated standard of living for large segments of the population.
3.    The very strength of the economic recovery has, however, aggravated the severe
infrastructure bottlenecks which were noted by the CAS to be a major impediment to private
sector development. Bottlenecks are particularly prevalent in transport, electricity distribution,
water supply and sewage and housing. An example of the problem was the electricity crisis
of December 1994, where frequent power outages disrupted economic activity and created
difficult living conditions. Investment flows averaging close to 20 percent of GDP would be
required to rebuild infrastructure and maintain an adequate level of public investment. The
required level of investment could not be provided under the constraints of the adjustment
program during 1993 and 1994, although an important step forward has been achieved with a
substantial increase in public investment in the 1995 budget. The priority given to infrastructure
in the 1993 CAS thus remains fully valid, with emphasis on providing investment capital and
helping to improve the institutional capacity and market-oriented policy framework.
4.    Agricultural land has been rapidly privatized since 1991. Nearly all cooperative land and
state farms have now been distributed, creating over 400,000 family farms. Agricultural output
grew about 17 percent in 1992 and 20 percent in 1993 as a result of these land reforms, together
with price liberalization. However, most new farms remain subsistence oriented and little
surplus food is marketed, as farmers seek to protect their food supplies. Additional measures
are required to encourage farmers to specialize according to their comparative advantage. These
include rehabilitating rural roads and other agricultural infrastructure, and further pricing, credit,
and land reforms. These measures will also help discourage additional migration to urban areas,
where unemployment rates remain high.

5.    Transport Sector. Albania's transport system is based on an interurban road network
of about 17,400 km, a 720 km railway, the main port of Durres, and an international airport at
Tirana. About 2,400 km of main roads and 5,000 km of secondary roads are administered by
the General Roads Directorate (GRD). Albania also has about 9,500 km of unclassified (rural)
roads, which are low standard roads or tracks. Most of these roads were formerly the
responsibility of state farms or cooperatives that have ceased to exist. Albania's 36 new
districts, part of the new system of local government, are now supposed to maintain these roads,
but have not taken any action due in large part to a lack of funds. GRD is also reluctant to be
responsible for these roads due to funding shortages. Most rural roads are now in very poor
condition due to lack of maintenance, with the result that some 400 villages and numerous
settlements housing a combined total of nearly one million people are inaccessible to motorized
vehicles at least part of the year.
6.    Albanian contractors have been commercialized and are now in an advanced stage of
privatization. About forty private domestic contracting companies exist. However, they lack
modern management experience, adequate equipment, and financial resources to execute road
rehabilitation works by themselves. The proposed project would provide these contractors with
an opportunity to bid on road rehabilitation subprojects under local competitive bidding (LCB)
procedures following satisfactory prequalification, and technical assistance provided under the
project would give them an opportunity for training in modem managerial and construction
techniques.
7.    Project Objectives: The objectives of the project are to: (a) promote agricultural
development and improve access to rural population centers by rehabilitating and maintaining
rural roads; (b) establish the institutional and financial arrangements for administering and
maintaining non-GRD roads on a sustainable basis; (c) reduce poverty and increase employment
by carrying out project works with labor intensive methods; and (d) encourage the development
of the domestic contracting and consulting industries.
8.    Project Description: The project was prepared on the basis of a consultant study
financed by a grant from the Swiss Government. The project includes: (a) improvement of rural
roads by contractors using labor intensive methods (US$29.51 million, including contingencies);
(b) maintenance equipment and tools for GRD's district workshops, and operational costs
(US$1.40 million); (c) TA to implement the project (US$2.30 million); and (d) a study and road
inventory to establish the administrative and financial arrangements for managing non-GRD
roads, followed by implementation of agreed recommendations (US$0.40 million). Most project
roads would be selected from agricultural regions in two areas, including ten coastal districts
plus the district of Tirana, and three Southeastern districts. The areas were selected on the basis
of agricultural output, population density, unemployment, and planned complementary
investments (primarily irrigation).
9.    Project Financing: The project is estimated to cost about US$33.60 million, with a
foreign exchange cost of US$7.91 million. IDA would finance US$15.00 million, and the GOA
US$3.60 million, or 11 percent of project cost, which is considered the maximum affordable
under current budgetary constraints. The Government of Italy has agreed to provide US$15.00



-3-
million equivalent (Italian Lira 24.80 billion) in cofinancing, as the project supports their
objective of promoting agricultural development in Albania.
10.  Implementation and Procurement. The project will be implemented by GRD and its
District Roads Directorates (DRDs) through privatized Albanian road-building contractors
applying labor-intensive methods with the assistance of international consultants and an internal
Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The project will begin with an eight-month preparation
period (May-December 1995) for, among other things, the prequalification of local contractors,
followed by a three-year (1996-1998) physical implementation period. Retroactive financing up
to US$ 100,000 would be applied for payments made by the Borrower for the preparation period
between May 1, 1995 and the date of credit signature. The first year, 1996, will be a pilot
phase. Procurement will follow Bank Guidelines with prequalification of contractors and LCB
procedures for road works. The works will be grouped into packages that are suitable for local
contractors. The results of the implementation of the first year, pilot phase packages in 1996,
will determine the packages and construction organization in the second and third years.
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures with post-qualification of suppliers will be
applied for road equipment. Consultants for TA, training, and an Organization and Management
Study will be selected following Bank Guidelines for selection of consultants.
11.   Project Sustainability: The objective of enabling agricultural output to be increased is
considered to be sustainable because agricultural land has been privatized, agricultural output
is growing, and because the project complements other agricultural investments. The project
follows the ongoing Transport Project, Credit 2499-ALB, which is being successfully
implemented. The objective of improving rural road maintenance and administration is
considered sustainable based on the arrangements discussed in paras. 18 and 19 below.
12.   Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement: There has been one project in the transport
sector. The Transport Project includes the rehabilitation of 84 km of main roads, improvement
of road maintenance in GRD's Tirana District, a road safety program, improvements at the port
of Tirana, a study of the future of Albanian Railways, and TA to increase the market orientation
of the transport sector and implement the project. The project has been effective since October
27, 1993, and is being implemented satisfactorily with minor delays.
13.   Rationale for IDA Involvement: The proposed project supports the Country Assistance
Strategy for Albania (reviewed by the Board on March 8, 1994) by specifically supporting three
important objectives in Albania's development strategy: the rehabilitation of infrastructure
needed to achieve a supply response, the development of agriculture in which Albania has a
comparative advantage, and the reduction of poverty by creating jobs in rural areas. IDA is
experienced in labor intensive road works, as well as in the institutional reforms required under
the project. IDA's presence has also helped to attract cofinancing for a high priority project.
14.   Environmental Aspects: The project includes rehabilitation and maintenance of existing
roads, and has, therefore, been placed in environmental category B in accordance with the
provisions of O.D. 4.01. Civil works will be subject to a limited environmental review,
including assurance that measures for adequate drainage and protection against erosion
formulated in the contractual documents are complied with. If any new roads are considered



-4-
for inclusion in the project at a later stage, individual Environmental Impact Assessments will
be carried out.
15.   Program Objectives Categories: The project will have a significant impact on poverty
because of the use of labor intensive construction and because the project will be carried out in
rural areas where the majority of poor people live. Labor intensive construction is expected to
generate a total of 12,000 man-year jobs during the three-year construction program of road
rehabilitation. Considering that an additional 500 permanent road maintenance jobs will also be
created, the project is expected to have a measurable effect on unemployment. The project has,
therefore, been rated as "Poverty Category: Program for Targeted Interventions" in accordance
with the provisions of O.D. 4.15.
16.   Project Benerits: Project benefits have been quantified on the basis of savings in vehicle
operating costs and road maintenance costs. The project has important unquantified benefits
including increased agricultural production, the generation of employment, development of the
domestic contracting and consulting industry, institutional improvements for road maintenance,
the better rural services, and environmental improvements, e.g., reduction of soil erosion.
Vehicle operating costs have been estimated using HDM III. Road design standards were
assessed and formulated taking maintenance costs into account. All project roads were selected
on the basis of their economic priority. The project is estimated to have an economic rate of
return (ERR) of 33 percent.
17.   Risks: One project risk is that the GOA will not provide sufficient funds to maintain the
project roads. However, the Government has increased the budget for maintaining the main road
network above the levels agreed under the Transport Project. The proposed levels of additional
funding are expected to be within the Government's capacity to support, without a major
reorientation of expenditure. A second risk is that the GOA will fail to implement the necessary
institutional reforms to administer and maintain the feeder road network, probably at the local
level. However, GOA has already adopted legislation on local Government reform, and has
established a task force to address the remaining issues, in particular the definition of a financing
system. An additional risk relates to the complexity of organizing labor intensive road works.
We will minimize this risk by using consultants for supervision who are experienced in this area
and by training local consultants on the site. Project risks are considered to be acceptable with
these arrangements. There is one country risk, the threat of a Balkan war, which cannot be
assessed.
18.  Issues and Actions to be Agreed. The main issue is to ensure that the project roads are
properly constructed (through the use of labor-intensive methods) and maintained, and then, to
establish an administrative and financial framework for administering and maintaining non-GRD
roads.  Presently, GRD and its DRDs are the only organizations in Albania capable of
administering construction contracts and maintaining roads carrying the traffic volumes of the
project roads. However, neither GRD and its DRDs, nor any other organization, has budgeted
allocations for the maintenance of these roads. Therefore, during project negotiations, GOA
agreed that: (a) GRD and its DRDs will administer the project; (b) road improvement works will
be executed through labor intensive methods, unless otherwise agreed with IDA; and (c) GOA
will provide sufficient annual funds to ensure that the roads improved under the project are
regularly maintained. This is expected to be about US$ 450,000 in fiscal 1997 increasing to



-5-
US$ 650,000 in fiscal 2001. Furthermore, the establishment of the PIU and its Secretariat, two
conditions of credit negotiations, took place on March 3, 1995, and the appointment of a Project
Coordinator, a condition of Board presentation, was approved on May 1, 1995. The hiring of
a team of international consultants to supervise the entire project, is a condition of Credit
effectiveness.
19.   Over the long run, a way needs to be found to classify and maintain all roads. In most
countries, local government takes primary responsibility for the maintenance of low volume
roads, since most of the benefits are local. In Albania, there are three factors which need to be
considered to resolve this issue. First, local government needs a source of revenues to take on
this responsibility, either via an allocation from the central government budget or via its own
authority to levy taxes. The GOA has established a Task Force on decentralization that is
investigating this question for all local government functions. Second, definition of the rural
road network, maintenance tasks, and the responsibility of the communes, districts, GRD and
DRDs, all need to be defined. Third, GRD, with the assistance of consultants financed under
the Transport Project, is in the process of defining which parts of the road network will be under
its responsibility. A coordinated approach and a comprehensive assessment are required to
ensure that all roads are maintained. A study will, therefore, be carried out under the project
to identify and classify the non-GRD road network, to recommend which sections should be
maintained by GRD, local government and others, to define maintenance methods (e.g. manual
maintenance organized locally with supervision and equipment provided by the DRD), to identify
equipment, staffing and budget requirements, to propose sources and uses of funds, and to
prepare a phased implementation plan. The GOA agreed at negotiations to carry out the
Organization and Management Study and to implement agreed recommendations.
20.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed credit.
