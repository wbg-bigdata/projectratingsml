PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
INDONESIA
NUCLEUS ESTATE AND SMALLHOLDERS I, II AND III PROJECTS
(LOANS 1499-IND, 1604-IND AND 1751-IND)
PREFACE
This is a Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) on the first
three Nucleus Estate and Smallholders (NES) Projects, involving IBRD loans
of US$65.0 million for  NES  I,  US$65.0  million  for  NES II, and US$99.0
million for NES III to the Republic of Indonesia. The objectives in all
three cases were to expand the plantings of selected state-owned estate
companies (PTPs) and to mobilize their expertise to help establish
smallholdings for landless and poor settlers on unexploited land suitable
for rubber planting; in the case of NES II, the PTP role was extended to
include rubber replanting on existing holdings. The same objectives became
the basis for four subsequent loans, bringing total commitments for all
seven projects in the NES series to US$654.7 million by January 25, 1983.
The dates of loan approval, effectiveness, closing and final disbursement
together with the loan amounts cancelled at the request of the Borrower
were as follows:
NES I         NES II          NES III
Date of approval               11/05/77       06/29/78        07/23179
Date of effectiveness         02/20/78        09/13/78         11/12/79
Planned date of closing       05/20/81         12/30/83        12/31/86
Actual date of closing         06/30/84        12/31/86        12/31/87
Date of final disbursement   04/01/85         05/27/87        06/27/88
Loan amounts cancelled        US$8.1 M        US$14.5 M       US$7.7 M
The PPAR is based on the  Project Completion Reports (PCRs) of the
projects prepared by the Asia Regional Office and issued in May 1989,1/
the Staff Appraisal and President's Reports, the loan documents, the
transcripts of the Executive Directors' meetings at which the projects were
considered, a study of project files, and on discussions with Bank staff.
An OED mission visited Indonesia in February 1989, and discussed the
effectiveness of the Bank's assistance to NES I and 1%..i II with Bappenas,
the Directorate General Estates, and other participating agencies. Their
kind cooperation and valuable assistance  in the preparation of thts report
are gratefully acknowledged.
1/ Project Completion Report, Indonesia Nucleus Estates and Smallholders I
Project (Loan 1499-IND) and Nucleus Estates and Smallholders II Project
(Loan 1604-IND), Report No. 7794, May 31, 1989. A draft PCR on NES III,
issued by the Asia Regional Office on April 6, 1989, is being prepared
for release shortly.



- ii -
The PCRs provide a satisfactory account and assessment of the
project.' experiences end discuss the performance of the Bank and the
project executing agencies. The PPAR elaborates on particular aspects .-ii^h
as the performance of the NES approach relative to earlier approaches to
s_allholder  development,  the  form   of  contractural  arrangements  (for
mall'iolder development) between PTPr and the DGE, and the foodcropping
propo*als for settlers.
Following standard OED procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were
sent to the Government. No comments were, however, received.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
INDONESIA
NUCLEUS ESTATE AND SMALLHOLDERS I, II AND III PROJECTS
(LOANS 1499-IND, 1604-IND AND 1751-IND)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       The projects under review are the first three of a series of seven
Nucleus Estate and Smallholders  (NES)  projects.    NES  I was approved in
November, 1977, NES II in June, 1978, and NES III in July, 1979. The three
projects involved seven state-owned limited liability plantation companies
(PTPs) operating in the seven provinces of Aceh, Riau, Jambi, South
Sumatera, Lampung, West  Java,  and  South  Kalimantan.   The target small-
holders under the projects were 23,100 settler families and rubber small-
holders.
Objlectives
2.       In accordance with GOI's  policy  of expanding agricultural output
and employment in the Outer Islands, the objectives of all three projects
were similar, namely, to mobilize the technical and managerial expertise if
state-owned estate companies to help establish smallholdings for landless
and poor settlers on unexploited land suitable for rubber planting. NES II
extended the role of PTPs in smallholder development to include rubber
replanting with high yielding varieties on existing holdings. The projects
would generate productive employment at relatively low cost, and raise
family incomes of the landless and near landless poor. GOI required that
public sector estates be utilized as nuclei to promote and guide small-
holder development. To perform this role, the PTPs' capabilities were to
be strengthened. Production of smallholder rubber and estate rubber, coco-
ntts, and palm oil would be  increased, contLibuting to the government pol-
icy of promoting non-petroleum  exports.    The institution building objec-
tives we:a (i) strengthening the Estates Training Institute (LPP) in NES I
to improve management training, and establishing the Sungai Tiga Training
Center under NES II; (ii) strengthening the Directorate General of Estates
(DGE) in investment planning, preparation, and implementation; and streng-
thening monitoring and evaluation of on-going and future NES projects
partly through the establishment of a special team (Tim Khusus) under NES
III; and (iii) improving the planning, production and financial management
techniques of the PTP system.
Implementation
3.       The implementaticn periods were to be five years for each of NES I
(1977/78-1982/83) and NES II (1978/79-1983/84) and seven and one-half years
for NES III (1979/80-1986/87).       While the planting of the nucleus estate



- xii -
crops proceeded approximately on schedule, the closing dates for all three
projects were extended (NES I by two years, NES II by three years, and NES
III by one year) to allow for the completion of other components, particu-
larly sm llholder development.   At  project  closing, most of the physical
targets set out at appraisal had been accomplished; the exceptions con-
cerned _'nly smallholder components. The smallholder replanting component
of NES II encountered serious problems and was not fully implemented. The
quality of some rubber plantings for settlers was below par, and the areas
of settler food cropping were well below expectations. Parts of the loan
proceeds were cancelled (12 percent of NES I, 22 percent of NES II, and 7
percent of NES III) due mainly to devaluation of the local currency.
Results
4.       For NES I and II,  the  revised yield estimates for nucleus estate
coconuts and rubber, but not for oil palm, are considerably lower than the
appraisal forecast. On the smallholdings, only 75 percent of the rubber
plantings are currently of fully acceptable standard, expected to be tapp-
able at about 5 years of age, 13 percent require upgrading to be tappable a
year or more after expectation, and 12 percent need extensive rehabilita-
tion or replanting. For NES III, revised yield estimates for smallholder
rubber are also reported to be less than expected at appraisal. Food crop
development for settlers' subsistence needs and as an additional source of
income in all three projects did not meet expectations, partly because of a
lack of effective extension, but also because of flawed expectations about
foodcropping on the difficult soils in the project areas.
5.       The overall economic rates of  return  (ERRs) of the projects have
been re-estimated as 14 percent for NES I, 13 percent for NES II, and 15Z
for NES III. All three rates are lower than estimated at appraisal, but
still satisfactory.    The  PCRs  attribute  the  ERR  slippages to delayed
benefits resulting from implementation delays, lower yield expectations due
to  substandard  rubber  plantings   for   smallholders,  lower  food  crop
production,  and  less  favorable  commodity  price  forecasts.   Appraisal
forecasts  for  the  nucleus  estate   coaponents  tended  to  be  far  too
optimistic.
Sustainability
6.       Anticipated project benefits could  be  achieved and maintained if
increased effort is given to full rehabilitation of sub-standard plantings
and to establishment of an effective extension system for tree crop produc-
tion on smallholdings. The projects have not resolved the problem of how
to sustain annual food cropping systems on red-yellow podzolic soils. The
treecropping systems are, however, sustainable.
Lessons Learned
7.       Problems arising from poor coordination among government agencies,
delayed approval of budgets and release of funds, and cumbersome procure-
ment procedures were not fully appreciated at appraisal. Inter-agency
coordination has improved in later projects, and earlier procurement



- xiii -
bottlenecks have recently been largely removed, but government budgeting
and procurement procedures still merit review.
8.       Institutional weaknesses  persisted  throughout the implementation
periods of the projects. While the DGE required the PTPs to undertake the
smallholder development, and the legal terms and conditions had been
clearly specified in advance, the funding conditions in particular were not
observed by Government, to the detrimeat of project performance. One of
the lessons of this experience is that even well designed legal agreements
regarding the use of state-owned commercial entetprises for development
purposes may not be sufficiently protective of such enterprises unless they
also enjoy and exercise considerable autonomy (paras. 50-52).
9.       Some of  the  poor  plantings  on  smallholdings  could  have been
avoided if shortcomings had been detected earlier through more intensive
physical monitoring.   While  there  is  urgent  need for strengthening the
monitoring capacity in DGE, and for establishing an independent inspection
service to report on technical aspects of all tree crop development, there
is also need for better formulae for compensating PTP work on behalf of
smallholders. The formula used, 15S of costs, invites charges that it
rewards excessive expenditures (paras. 53-55).
10.      From a broader perspective, the  experience of these projects dem-
onstrates how readily the capacity of a dirigiste approach to smallholder
development in Indonesia can be overstretched. While there are clear indi-
cations of how that approach, embodied in the NES projects, can be
improved, the problems encountered also call for difterent or at least
complementary approaches that invite smallholders to take more of the
development initiative (para. 45).
11.      The performance of settler  food  cropping reflects poorly on Bank
technical appraisal of this  component.   Fortunately, NES project benefits
lay mainly with the treecrops components, but the technical appraisal
errors on food crops were not confined to the NES projects. They were
repeated in Transmigration II (Loan 1707-IND/Credit 919-IND), for which
food cropping was more critical (paras. 56-58).
12.      Regrettably, not enough seems to have been learnt from these three
project experiences in sufficient time for the remedies to be applied in
subsequent projects in the series. NES IV, V, VI and VII were all approved
well before the completion of NES I.  Bank supervision staff have in recent
times graded all four of these later projects as "problem projects". The
Bank deferred further commitments to the NES approach to treecrops
development after January  1983  to  permit  implementation  problems to be
addressed. This fact also supports the conclusion that the Bank committed
too much too soon (paras. 46-48).

INDONESIA
NUCLEUS ESTATE AND SMALLHOLDERS I, II AND III PROJECTS
(LOANS 1499-IND. 1604-IND AND 1751-IND)
I. BACKGROUND
Context
1.       Prior to its involvement  with  the Nucleus Estate and SmAllholder
(NES) projects, the Bank Group had assisted the treecrops sector in
Indonesia with a series of IDA credits and one IBRD loan. Four of the
credits, approved between 1969 and 1972, supported development of public
sector estates involving mainly ribber and, in one instance, tea.l/ The
next two credits, approved in 1973, supported smallholder rubber and tea.2/
In 1976, the Board approved the Bank's first loan in support of Indonesia's
transmigration  F cogram,  which  in   this  instance  involved  smallholder
settlement based on rubber.3/ As footnoted, the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) han reported on the outcomes for all seven of these
earlier projects. Experiences with all of them contributed in some measure
to the design of the NES projects.
2.       The first of the  earlier  smallholder projects, the North Sumatra
Smallholder Development Project (NSSDP), was designed to increase the
incomes of about 18,000 families in North Sumatra through planting and
replanting of 5,700 ha of rubber and 3,300 ha of oil palm, constructing low
cost processing facilities, improving roads and providing agricultural
sLpport services and training to farmers.   It was regarded as experimental
and was to provide information on the reaction of smallholders to
development activities. A Project Management Unit (PMU), with managerial
and financial autonomy, was to be established and made responsible for
project implementation with the assistance of expatriate specialists.

3.       The June 1982 audit of NSSDP reestimated its ERR at 18.72, but the
audit concluded that the project development strategy had proven too costly
*nd was not replicable on a national scale (see next para. for related
problems of cost recovery).   It  charged  that NSSDP had failed to develop
low-cost initiatives for smallholder rubber that could be readily repeated,
and it had therefore contributed little to institution building: 'The
project was organized from the top down, with limited farmer participation,
relying instead on extensive financial assistance to act as stimuli for
improved  production.'       The   audit   claimed,  however,  that  valuable
institutional experience had been obtained and that the lessons learned had
been applied in the follow-on NES projects beginning with NES I which had
been approved in November 1977.    Considering  the elapsed time of 4 years
and 9 monchs between approval of NSSDP and approval of NES I, the potential
for such lesson learning and application was quite plausible.
4.       The NSSDP audit also found  fault  with a number of other arrange-
ments. With regard to smallholder financint, it claimed that little atten-
tion was paid during project implementation to developing an effective and
replicable grant and credit disbursement system with an adequate recovery
mechanism. It suggested, as an alternative to credit, that government
collect a tax on rubber exports and use its proceeds to finance the cost of
rubber replanting in the form of  grants to individual replanters.  On land
transfers, it observed that land distributed to smallhvlders was not sur-
veyed or registered by the Lands Department, and that no formal decision
was taken as to the value and annual rent of the land or on how to enforce
leasing terms. Finally, it worried that the project design had not come to
grips with the replanting problem, i.e. with how to encourage smallholders
country-wide to replant  at  low  cost.    All  these  alleged faults taken
together make the audit's principle indictment of non-replicability easier
to understand.
5.       The  second  of  the  smallholder  projects,  the  Smallholder and
Private Estate Tea Project (SPETP), was designed to rehabilitate or replant
10,000 ha of smallholder and 3,200 ha of private estate tea gardens, to
rehabilitate five and construct two black tea factories, and to promote
technical assistance to the Project Management Unit (PMU) and Bank Rakyat
Indonesia (BRI). Like its NSSDP predecessor, SPETP was also relatively
successful as an isolated investment project, earning a favorable ERR, but
it did not become a model for expanded Bank lending, partly because the
Bank Group ceased lending for tea expansion projects. Its most pertinent
lesson learned related  to  organization  and  management.   The completion
report concluded that too many agencies had been involved, and that the PMU
had insufficient authority and financial resources.
6.       The Transmigration I Project  comprised  two test schemes, one for
the establishment of a new settlement at Baturaja, South Sumatra Province,
and the other for upgrading an existing settlement in the adjacent Lampung
Province. The main features of the Baturaja scheme were the construction
of 10 village centers with about 4,500 settler houses and adequate health



and school facilities; the construction of roads and tracks; block-planting
of 4,500 ha of rubber and maintenance for six years; distribution of about
4,500 head of cattle and of farm inputs; the establishment of agricultural
credit, extension and cooperative services; and the provision for one year
of food and other eassntial commodities.    The substance and scale of most
of these features, with the notable exception of the cattle, will be
recognizable in the NES projects as  well.    As with later projects in the
transmigration series, Transmigration I involved human settlement on
red/yellow podzolic soils typical of the humid tropics. Such environmental
conditions were similar to those confronting settlement in the NES
projects.
7.       Weak management and  procurement  problems  during the first three
years delayed the start up of Transmigration I. Thereafter, the project
gained momentum, and the audit considered it to have been successful. The
ERRs for the two test scheme components were 17% and 22% respectively. One
point  of  interest  highlighted  in   the  audit  was  that  the  Baturaja
settlement, due to its pilot nature, was not representative of Government's
overall settlement program. The audit warned that this settlement's above-
average  agricultural   and   economical   results,   especially  regarding
cultivation of red/yellow podzolic soils, should be considered as potential
levels achievable only under intensive investment and technical assistance
conditions.   The  inclusion  of  treecrops  in  this  first  of the Bank's
transmigration projects had proved auspicious though, and decisions taken
in subsequent transmigration projects to move away from treecrops towards
more reliance on foodcrops were to attract no small controversy.
8.       These lessons, or insights into a near-term development agenda for
smallholder treecrops, which had become apparent in some degree during the
implementation of these earlier projects, presented some of the challenges
that faced the design and implementation of NES I and, indeed, of the
series of NES projects that were about to begin. 
DesiRn
9.       At  the  heart  of  the  NES  concept  was  the  establishment  of
smallholder settlements and treecrop plantings in areas adjacent to a PTP
estate, and the employment of that PTP as the principal implementing agency
for achieving such establishment.    The  Government's and Bank's rationale
for employing public sector estates in this manner was "their technical and
managerial expertise" in matters related to treecrops (SAR, NES I, p. iv).
The NES projects were to include other components to expand the PTPs' own
estate plantings - somewhat in the tradition of the Bank's first four
credits for treecrops estates - and to strengthen their (smallholder
settlement) implementation capacity.   The  project support for investments
in nucleus estates was argued independently on its own merits, but it was
also intended as a quid pro quo for securing PTP commitment to a new role
for them as smallholder development  agents.    What  was to be new in this
project initiative, compared to previous efforts on behalf of smallholders,



was (i) the organization and management arrangements - the use of the PTPs
instead of PMUs as executing agents; and (ii) ita replicability on a wide
scale - costs per family were to be low, and on-farm development costs were
to be recovered.
10.      The  official  Bank  files  on  NES  I  begin  with  a  message to
headquarters in March  1973  from  the  Bank's  Resident Mission in Jakarta
supporting proposals to develop public estates as nuclei for assisting
smallholders. Headquarters staff responded favorably to the nucleus estate
concept but expressed reservations about the 'capability of very weak
estate   management   to    undertake   additional   responsibilities   for
smallholders.'       Jakarta  staff   rejoined  that  earlier  projects  had
strengthened a number of PTPs and that, in any case, such weaknesses that
remained could be addressed by technical assistance.
11.      As preparation of NES I advanced, initially in hopes of appraising
a suitable project early in 1974, a large number of issues occupied Bank
staff, including the technical feasibility of the food cropping proposals,
and the appropriate area  of  rubber  plantings  per   smallholder.  On the
latter issue, senior Bank Management gave clear direction in favor of a
modest rubber area:  2 ha.   As  the SAR reports, the "large number of very
small farmers, rural landless and a growing underemployed and unemployed
rural labor force dictate that the cost to the Government per settler
family be reduced to a minimum in order to maximize the number of
beneficiary smallholders."   This choice  was in line with known Government
priorities.
12.      As regards food cropping on  red/yellow  podzolic soils, the NES I
Project Files refer to discussions in June 1976 of views expressed in a
paper circulated in 1975, the opening para. of which reads:
"Research on cropping systems in transmigration areas is
badly needed. In Lampung each family that transmigrates
receives two hectares of land.   A farmer and his family
can cultivate only one hectare, the rest lies fallow or
grows-up in bushes or alang-alang. Furthermore, soil in
this   area   is   predominately   red-yellow  podzolic,
deficient in N, P and K and has a low pH. The small
amount of organic matter in the soil is found in the
upper five to ten centimeters and is quickly decomposed
upon cultivation.   Within  a  period  of  three to five
years the soil is depleted of its fertility and crops
begin to fail. Alang-alang is the only vegetation that
will grow well. Soil survey reports indicate that there
are about 46 million hectares of red-yellow podzolic and
associated soils in Indonesia with about 1.5 million
hectares in Lampung alone."



-5-
Regarding the same soils, the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) for NES I
acknowledges the 'inadequate depth of knowledge of the technology required
to sustain continuous or even rotational food cropping on these soils,
particularly with satisfactory  levels  of  yield."    The SAR accepted the
risks involved partly because food cropping represented only 20Z of farm
income (at full development).
13.      After many delays in  preparation,  Bank  staff presented NES I to
the Board for approval in November 1977. Subsequent projects in the series
are closely modelled on this first one.
14.      The physical and financial details of  NES I, II and III are shown
in Boxes 1 and 2.    These  details  reveal the strong affinity between the
three pr.ject designs but also several respects in which they differ. For
example, rubber plantings per smallholder were 2 ha and food crop areas 3
ha in both NES I and NES II.   But  by the time of NES III, its Danau Salak
settlement had 3 ha of smallholder rubber and a smaller food crop area.
The following sections discuss other design variations, the arrangements
for project smallholder rubber pricing, project financing and cost recovery
from smallholders.
15.      Design  Variations.    There  were  five  other  principal  design
variations. First, NES II devoted a much higher proportion of project
costs to the smallholder components than did NES I and III. Second, NES II
introduced  a  component  intended   to   address  the  needs  of  existing
smallholder rubber producers by replanting low quality rubber tree stands
with clonal varieties. Third, the technical assistance costs of NES I were
large because of the complexities of the new type of project. The much
smaller TA component of NES III was directed at setting up a special team
to assist DGE with the NES program.   Fourth, NES III was to be implemented
over 7.5 years, a more realistic time frame than the 5 years for NES I and
II. Fifth, the percentage of smallholder project costs to be recovered
through loans declined from 93Z for NES I through 76Z for NES II to 53Z for
NES III.
16.      Smallholder Rubber Prices.  The  SAR  for NES I made the following
observations about the local markets for smallholder-produced rubber:   the
variations in margins for middlemen were 5 to 10% of the fob value of good
quality smoked sheet rubber; although farmers were not generally exploited
in prices received, they could receive better prices with improvement in
conditions of marketing their own rubber; in the project area of Tebenan,
South Sumatera, smallholder rubber farmers had been receiving about 35 to
45Z of the fob value of their product; in the other smallholder project
area near Langsa, Aceh, smallholder rubber producers had been receiving a
slightly higher percentage of the fob price, about 40-50Z; this higher
percentage was the result of greater competition of collection agents in
the area and the generally shorter distances required in transportation to
processors.   Although  these  observations  need  clarification in several

respects, their general  inference  was  clear:    the marketing system for
smallholder rubber could be improved.
17.      The SAR  calculated  that  nucleus  estates  could  afford  to pay
smallholder farmers about 70S  of  the  fob  value of their rubber product,
even when depreciation and the cost of capital for processors was added to
their normal processing  and  collection  costs.    GOI  had indicated that
nucleus  estate   processors   should   collect   sufficient   rubber  from
smallholders to meet their repayment obligations under the project - as
well as all other rubber that project smallholders chose to sell - at a
price  about  702  of  the  fob  value.    Accordingly,  the  Bank obtained
assurances during negotiations that the borrower would cause the nucleus
estate processors to pay 70X of the prevailing fob rubber price to
smallholder  project  farmers,  barring   exceptional   events  such  as  a
significant  fall   in   rubber   prices   or   a   significant  change  in
processing/marketing costs.
18.      Financing.  The proceeds of the Bank loans and the bulk of the GOI
funds shown in Box 2 were to be channelled to the participating PTPs in two
streams, and subject  to  different  conditions:    (i) for expenditures on
investments to be debited against participating smallholders .. according to
Smallholder  Financing   Arrangements;   and   (ii)   for  expenditures  on
investments to be debited  against public estates.. according to Subsidiary
Loan  Agreements.    Non-credit  items  for  smallholders  such  as village
infrastructure, main access and village roads, atnd health services would be
financed entirely from GOI annual budget sources and INPRES (special)
programs .
19.      Appraisal documents and  the  legal  agreements provided admirable
detail  on  the  obligations  of  the  various  parties  to  the  financing
agreements.   For  example,  the  SAR  for  NES  I  provided  both terms of
reference for the nucleus estate  acting as executing agent for smallholder
development and a draft specimen  contract  between that nucleus estate and
the DGE. In retrospect, two aspects of that draft contract are of special
interest:
(i)   The nucleus estate was  to  be  responsible  for the best possible
preparation of the smallholder rubber plantation, and would be
paid for its head office ovcrheads and field overheads at the rate
of 15%  per  annum  of  ' s  direct  expenditures  made for rubber
development, machinery anu :quipment, or as agreed by the DGE
based on satisfactory performance.
(ii)   Finance required for nucleus  estate  credic expenditures meant to
be debited to smallholders would be provided by GOI through BRI
according to the terms of a Subfinancing Agreement.
Regarding this second aspect, tie  Loan  Agreement  for NES I duly required
the Borrower (GOI) to make available to the nucleus estate the amounts



- 7 -
required to  meet  such  credit  expenditures.    Such  amounts  were to be
determined on the basis of annual budgets approved at least 3 months before
the  start  of  each  fiscal  year   and  were  to  be  advanced  quarterly
sufficiently in advance to enable the nucleus estates to carry out their
functions without delays resulting from unavailability of funds. The Loan
Agroements for NES II and NES III carried similar requirements on both
aspects.
20.      Cost Recovery.  Expenditures  on  smallholder credit items were to
be recovered from participating smallholders through rubber collections.
These credit items included land clearing, agro-chemicals and fertilizers,
wages paid to casual labor including settlers, settler housing, equipment
for rut er development, a subsistence package not to exceed Rp 15,000 per
family, estate roads and tracks, and 15% of the direct costs of rubber
establishment and related machinery and equipment (other than vehicles) as
an overhead fee to the nucleus  estate.   The expected total credit amounts
for each project are shown in Box 2.
21.      BRI was designated  as  the  fiscal  agent  for cost recovery from
participating smallholders, with repayments to be collected in kind by the
nucleus estate rubber processors.    These rubber collections were expected
to represent about 25% of smallholders' rubber production.
Board Concerns
22.      Executive Directors raised several issues on the occasion of staff
presentation of these projects to the Bank's Board. In the case of NES I,
the Board questioned the alleged emphasis on smallholders when 60% of
project costs favored nucleus estate  development.   Staff replied that the
intended emphasis would become more apparent in the newly appraised NES II
project, which would see 80% of costs favoring smallholder development.
The Board asked why the existing market price of rubber to smallholders was
nnly some 40%  of  f.o.b.  prices.    Staff  replied  that  it reflected an
exploitation by the marketing system. Board enquiries regarding an article
appearing in the Wall Street Journal in the week priot to the Board Meeting
led to a lengthy discussion of the Bank's lending irogram in Indonesia.
Among the wide range of issues discussed that had bearing on the NES I
project were the program's experience with project delays and with
institutional difficulties within Indonesia, and the differences of view
within the Bank on approaches to settlement uader the transmigration
program, including the relative emphasis therein on food crops and
treecrops.
23.      In introducing the  NES  II  project  to  the  Board, seven months
later, the Staff referred to government's desire to intensify its programs
of transmigration and NES development to realize a broad range of
government objectives. Staff also mentioned that they expected to deliver
soon a transmigration project having as its basis an economically viable
food cropping system.   (Loan  1707  for  the Transmigration II Project was



- 8 -
subsequently approved by the Board on May 29, 1979). The Board queried the
risks of maintaining a fixed smallholder rubber price of 702 of the f.o.b.
export price if the market price happened to rise above this level. Staff
felt that such price movements  were  unlikely.   The Board returned to the
puzzle of why existing market prices were so low (in this instance 35Z of
f.o.b. levels) and why smallholder repayments were planned to be in kind
rather than in value. It also expressed concerns about the transmigration
element in the settlement and about the then indifferent performance of
Loan 1318 (Transmigration  I).    Staff  replied  that  Loan  1318 had some
problems with infrastructure and was getting b, ter. Finally, the Board
raised the possible relevance for the NES projects of cost overruns and
implementation delay. in the Bank's irrigation projects in Indonesia.
24.      In the case of NES  III  the  Board queried the Bank's decision to
provide two-thirds of project costs and the high foreign exchange share nf
project costs. On the latter, staff pointed to the expensive equipment
necessary for land clearing and rubber processing facilities. The Board
also queried the validity of resource constraints said to confront the
Indonesian economy at a time (1979) when oil prices everywhere and
Indonesian oil revenues had  risen  sharply.   (Project files indicate that
the Board was concerned about the inadequate levels of local financing then
being provided by GOI for NES I and II). Staff reassured the Board that
government had allocated adequate local funds for the ongoing NES I and II
and for the expected needs of NES III.
II. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
25.      Implementation was generally  successful  in  the  case of nucleus
estate components, although their achievements fell short of expectations,
particularly in the case of NES I and NES III, due largely to overly
optimistic appraisal forecasts.
26.      Implementation  of  the  smallholder  components  experienced many
difficulties. Repeated delays in the release of government funding was a
major problem for the  PTPs  concerned.    Because many of the agricultural
operations could not wait for the prescribed financing procedures to catch
up, PTPs had to use their own funds to pre-finance many activities. This
happened frequently.    The  two  most  prominent  causes  of the financing
problem were (i) restricted sources of government funding for treecrops
programs, which relied on export tax revenue rather than the general
budget; and (ii) general overcommitment of government financial resources.
The second cause was probably the more basic one. Independently of its
Bank-assisted NES projects, government expanded rapidly a parallel NES
program (as well as other programs), relying on its own resources,
particularly after the 1979 rise in oil prices. Bank supervision attempts
to persuade government to broaden the NES funding base met with periodic



- 9 -
but limited respou4se overall, partly because these broader funds had also
become heavily comitted.
27.      The NES II replanting program in  the vicinity of Bajubang made so
little headway that it was replaced by a new settler block nearby at
Kilangan.
28.      Quality control  of  PTP  rubber  plantings  on smallholder blocks
suffered serious lapses, and extensive areas of plantings were damaged for
lack of protection against pests.
29.      Most of  the  technical  assistance  and  training components were
implemented. Those related to the Estates Training Institute (LPP) at
Yogyakarta (NES I) appear to have been quite successful, as were also those
related to training at Sungai Tiga (NES II) while funding lasted. The
audit could not check the effectiveness of technical assistance to Ministry
of Agriculture support staff because of staff changes and reorganizations.
30.      The organizational and management  arrangements  for  NES I and II
planned at appraisal  underwent  several  changes.    Project documents had
recognized the need for a Project Manager to be responsible for the
settlement components, but had not foreseen the consequences of his
location in the overlapping agency  bureaucracies.   The Project Manager in
the early stages of NES I and II was the Provincial Head of Estate
Services, who would report directly to the DGE and be responsible for
supervising a range of settlement activities due for execution by a PTP or
a Provincial Government. Although this arrangement helped to balance the
lack of certain expertise in the PTPs (regarding technical extension,
handling people other than employees, and coordinating with the provincial
governments), it did not survive the consequences of assigning such a major
implementation role to the PTPs.   Beginning with NES III, the relevant PTP
First Director was appointed as Project Manager and this amendment was
applied in NES I and  II  as  well.    As  a  result, the PTPs assumed much
greater authority over settlement matters--e.g. as de facto coordinators of
provincial  government  agencies  at   the  working  level--than  had  been
advocated originally for them on paper.
31.      The audit understands that  government  policy on PTP offer prices
for the projects' smallholder rubber evolved somewhat during implementation
and that this policy soon applied  to  all  PTPs.   The level of price also
became more flexible. At the time of audit, PTP IV appeared to be offering
NES II smallholders prices in excess of the 70% fob level. Nevertheless,
private traders were still managing to buy the greater share of those
supplies at competitive prices.

III. PROJECT OUTCOME
32.      The more easily characLerized elements of outcome described in the
PCRs may be summarized in the order of NES I, II and III, as follows:
(i) execution delays were 65% (NES I;, 58% (NES II), and 21% (NES
III);
(ii)  US$ cost overruns were -5%, -13%, and 1%;
(iii) areas planted or rehabilitated on nucleus estates as 2 of targets
were 116%, 1062 and 116%;
(iv)  areas of rubber  planted  for  smallholders  as  2 of targets were
100%, 108% and 99;
(v) areas of rubber replanted for smallholders as a Z of targets were
36% (NES II only);
(vi)  areas planted to foodcrops as a  %  of  targets were 15% for NES I
and, 20% for NES II (see paras. 40-41 regarding NES II); the PCR
for NES III does not provide an estimate;
(vii) overall project ERRs re-estimated at completion were 14%, 13%, and
15% - compared with 30%, 14%, and 29% at appraisal;
(viii) the re-estimated ERRs for the smallholder components were 10%,
13%, and 14-15% - compared with 15%, 14%, and 14-19% at appraisal;
(ix)  while the  smallholder  components  experienced  the  more serious
implementation difficulties, the estate components experienced the
more serious ERRs slippages.    For  example, the estate component
ERR for PTP X in NES I fell from 35% at appraisal to 15% at
completion. These shor:falls in estate performance were largely
due to inflated appraisal estimates.
(x) all PCRs express concern about the prospects for adequate cost
recovery from smallholders on account of slow land registrations,
the slow pace of conversion of credit expenditures into individual
loans, and emerging doubts about the ability of smallholders with
3ubstandard plantings to repay.
33.      One important matter on which the PCRs are silent is the impact of
the NES program on the overall health of participating PTPs. NES support
for the nucleus estates was helpful to  them.   But the pressure on PTPs to
prefinance smallholder components imposed financial and other costs on them
that were t-t foreseen in appraisal documents. (The audit understands that



- 11 -
the Government has almost completed an analysis of the corporate plans and
finances of the key PTPs involved in the treecrops sector.)
34.      Settlement Rubber.   All  three  projects  achieved their targeted
areas of smallholder rubber  plantings.    The  timing and quality of these
plantings, however, compared unfavorably with expectations, due to a number
of shortcomings of implementation made clear in the PCRs. The irregular
flows  of  Government  funds   for  the  smallholder  components  disrupted
implementation s*hedules, as did the failure of government procurement
procedures to work as expected.   This assessment of the PCRs suggests that
both problems were unexpected and, in certain respects, not considered
fully enough at appraisal.   The appraisals had given careful consideration
to the legal safeguards of orderly financing but, as discussed below in the
context of PTP service contracts, these safeguards proved insufficient.
35.      The  NES  II  PCR  describes  the  replanting  program  as  "not a
success".    Achievement  of  an   otherwise  reasonable  85%  of  targeted
replantings at one site took three years longer than expected. The other
replanting site achieved only 4% of the targeted area. Lack of smallholder
organization and the loss of current income to smallholders following
clearirg of their low yielding trees must explain part of their poor demand
for NES  II's  replanting  services.    But  accounts  of  the difficulties
encountered at this latter site also suggest that PTPs were not an
appropriate choice of institution to deal with this problem.
36.      In addition to the contributing  factors  identified in the NES II
PCR --lack of suitable staff inputs, low management commitment, and limited
incentives for smallholder participants -- there were poor incentives for
the PTPs. Recall that a PTP's service fee was to be 15% of expenditures.
PTP expenditures on replanting 1 ha of rubber were expected to be of the
order of one quarter the expenditures on planting 1 ha of rubber for
settlement  (PTPs  contributed   much   less   labor  for  replanting,  the
smallholders in situ contributed more).   It is perhaps not surprising that
PTPs felt obliged to demand awkward conditions for their participation: a
minimum replanting area of 20 ha in one block, which they stipulated,
proved difficult for smallholders to deliver as a group.
37.      Food crops.  The PCRs for all three projects declare that the food
crop component was a failure.   Based  on its field observations, the audit
agrees. Areas planted tell part of the story.
38.      The Tebenan site for NES I was  supposed to support up to 6,300 ha
of food crops. Its actual plantings in the main areas reserved for food
cropping were nil. Field inspection reveals that this result alone may not
convey the cost of this component.   To the extent that PTP X cleared these
areas, it not only spent resources, but established in place of forest
vegetation vast areas of alang-alang (a noxious coarse grass).

39.      The other settlement site for NES I  -  Alue Ie Merah - saw 24% of
the food crop area planted. The food crop targets for both of these NES I
sites, as given in the PCR, are based on 2.8 ha of food crops per settler
at full development exclusive of the 0.2 ha house plot.
40.      Food crop targets for NES II,  as  given in Schedule 2 of the Loan
Agreement, were set rather confusingly, but represent a significant retreat
from objectives set  out  for  NES  I.    For  example,  the target for the
Bajubang site was distribution of inputs to support food crop production on
1140 ha at  full  development,  i.e.  on  0.6  ha  per  settler.   The Loan
Agreement also mentions the more extensive target of 3 ha for each
Participating Settler, including 1/5 ha for each house lot), but there was
apparently much lower conviction that this level of food cropping activity
would be achieved. If one expresses NES II's food cropping performance on
the same scale as that used for NES I (i.e. area planted in relation to 2.8
ha per settler), the audit estimates its achievements to be less than 20%
at both the Air Molek and Bajubang settlement sites. This result is in
line with the audit's casual field observations at Bajubang, and contrasts
with the NES II PCR's reported achievements of 150% at Air Molek and 1892
at Bajubang, which were based in part on the lower food cropping targets.
41.      The PCR for  NES  III  provides  no  comparable  data on food crop
achievements relative to targets, whether in terms of areas planted or
yields. It merely relates that this project component was a failure and
offers descriptions of the outcomes at the two main sites:
"At Danau Salak, most of the land cleared for food
crops has not been put to use," and
"While food crop production at the Rimbo Bujang
site was relatively more successful, it has not
been developed on a scale large enough to meet the
smallholders' needs".
42.      Overall, there can be no  question  but  that food crop output has
been a small fraction  of  expectations.    Quite  apart  from the issue of
whether the soils would support food cropping (discussed further below), it
now seems that no one had really tested whether prospective settlers were
interested in growing food crops.    Settlers  drawn from Java were willing
perhaps to try. Those drawn from the local population in project areas
were not. Beginning in 1979 or 1980, the original 5 ha allocation of land
to settlers at the Kilangan site (NES II) was cut to 3 ha, and 2 ha were
held in reserve,  possibly  for  other  smallholders.    The food crop area
allocation at Kilangan was found by the audit mission to be about 1 ha,
consistent with the lower allocations in NES III.

IV. ISSUES AND FINDINGS
A. Overview
43.      The audit accepts  tne  PCRs'  estimates  that all three projects'
investments are likely to achieve satisfactory, though modest returns. The
ability of these projects to survive their extensive implementation
problems reflects favorably on the soundness of their ultimate objectives
and on the potential for future  initiatives  in the treecrops sector.  The
NES projects promise a more sustainable and ecologically desirable form of
smallholder settlement than was achieved in most of the contemporary
transmigration projects; they also  assisted  large  numbers of landless or
near landless families to resettle, increased their incomes, and contrib-
uted strongly to regional development, agro-industry and export income. A
field visit to a smallholder project site offers petsuasive impressions
that rubber development provides a relatively attractive l.velihood to
smallholders. Wherever rubber plantings have been of acceptable qaality,
settlers seem genuinely  pleased  with  the  results.   Many genuinely poor
people have benefitted. At the same time, NES I, II and III also share
many of the shortcomings attributed to earlier projects designed to support
smallholders, and they have likely imposed certain "external" costs on
participating PTPs that have escaped measuirement. These negative features
reflect unfavorably on some aspects of project design and suggest caution
in pursuing the next round cf initiatives involving nucleus estates.
44.      The  main  disappointmcn':s  have  been  institutional  in  nature:
current doubts about the feasibility  of  smooth 1and registration and cost
recovery   revive   concerns   about   the   replicability   or   financial
sustainability of smallholder settlement programs;  the passive role of BRI
- as a fiscal agent rather than as an executir.g agent - in the smallholder
credit scheme begs the question  of  how a settlement program might perform
under more demanding conditions of settler selection; settlers were as
uninvolved in the design and execution of this style of project as they
were in the previous ones--top down" thinking is still a prominent feature
of the design; the evident need still for detailed coordination of many
participating  central  and   provincial   government   agencies,  and  the
difficulties thereof, raise questions about the dirigiste framework for
development which such projects typify; the PTPs' technocratic skills in
plantation management and agronomy were not immediately stretchable into
skills of social engineering  and  food  crop extension, problem areas into
which they were inevitably drawn; the overhead cost and corporate decision-
making structures of PTPs were not suited to the challenge of helpint
smallholiers to replant their rubber trees in small lots.
45.      Taking these observations together,  it  is  apparent that the NES
projects were still highly experinmental in nature, embodying design
initiatives that had limited or no track record. In their defense on this
score, one cannot  eschew  all  initiatives  in  the  face  of lessons from.

previous projects not to repeat past mistakes. Some risks had to be taken.
Moreover, one should ask what were tha alternatives? The audit's general
response is that the Bank acted correctly in supporting the NES approach,
but that it expanded its program of support with too great a tempo of
lending.
46.      The Bank  did  not  orchestrate  its  own  approach to risk-taking
prudently. Some design lessons were learnt and applied within the span of
designing NES I to III. But the audit believes that the Bank did not apply
the broader lessons in time.    Regrettably,  not enough seems to have been
learnt from these three project experiences in sufficient time for the
remedies to be applied in subsequent projects in the series. NES IV to VII
were all approved well before the completion of NES I. Bank supervision
staff have in recent times graded all four of these later projects as
"problem projectsN.   The  Bank  deferred  further  commitments  to the NES
approach  to   treecrops   development   after   January   1983  to  permit
implementation problems to  be  addressed.    This  fact  also supports the
conclusion that the Bank committed too much too soon.
47.      This audit finding--that the Bank lending program for NES projects
expanded too rapidly--highlights the risks associated with managing the
Bank's portfolio  this  way.    With  the  exception  of  the food cropping
component, the Bank's ex ante evaluations of NES I, II and III were above
average in quality, and one supposes that the subsequent NES project
proposals were  similarly  well  supported  analytically.    None  of these
proposals foresaw, however, the consequences of the government's rapid
expansion of smallholder tree crops development for individual project
performance. The rapid pace of Bank lending operations in this narrow
subsector ensured that project designs were unusually similar and that
unforeseen events over even a limited timeframe would affect them all.
B. PTP Service Contracts
48.      The projects'  design  for  compensating  the  principal executing
agencies for their smallholder development services should have been more
protective of smallholders; the best of legal agreements do not afford much
protection to executing agencies that have limited automony.
49.      Regarding the difficulties of protecting  the PTP nucleus estates,
experience suggests that the combination of both commercial and social
development objectives in the charter of an organization poses special
difficulties,  because  it   blurs   accountability.        However,  wherever
Governments direct their (commercial) state-owned enterprises to take on
developmental responsibilities oa behalf of Government (as was the case in
NES I, II and III), it is often possible to limit those difficulties by
requiring such additional responsibilities to be clearly defined in
contractual agreements and executed only if they are fully financed by
government. This clarifies accountability and offers financial protection
to the enterprise.



- 15 -
50.      Bank loan agreements for  NES  I,  II  and III explicitly required
service contracts for smallholder development that protected the PTPs from
the vagaries of  government  budget  support.    Yet during implementation,
serious delays in government funding occurred, disrupting PTP work plans
and drawing the PTPs concerned into prefinancing the smallholder settlement
components (para. 26).
51.      Bank  supervision  missions  repeatedly  drew  attention  to  this
problem, which, however, was never resolved satisfactorily during the
projects' implementation. The Bank had recourse, in a technical sense, to
sanctions under the legal agreements, but did not exercise them, solicitous
perhaps about the risks of worsening both the financial plight of the PTPs
and the precarious position of smallholder settlers. One might expect that
parties who are most injured through non-compliance with legal agreements
should impose their own sanctions.    But  this was not something that PTPs
could readily take up  with  their  owners.    One  of  the lessons of this
experience is that even well designed legal agreements regarding the use of
state-owned commercial enterprises for development purposes may not be
sufficiently protective of such enterprises unless they also enjoy and
exercise considerable autonomy.
52.      Regarding the need for greater protection of smallholders, the PTP
service contract's formula for PTP compensation did not create incentives
for PTPs to keep development costs under tight control. In principle, the
formula rewarded the PTPs in direct proportion to their expenditures per
settler. It is at least arguable, therefore, that certain problems with
quality control of rubber plantings that eventuated during implementation
are traceable to this aspect of project design.
53.      The formula for reimbursing PTPs for  their services was a form of
"cost plus". Defenders of the formula can cite the discretionary power of
Government to monitor expenditures and to enforce their reasonableness.
After all, PTP performance had to be satisfactory to supervisors from DGE.
In the event, this supervision proved inadequate, and one concludes that
such discretionary safeguards demanded too much of the Government's
capacity to supervise PTPs and to enforce their accountability. The PCRs'
conclusions that DGE still needs institutional strengthening supports this
conclusion. Critics of the formula can argue the inability of governments
to exercise such pervasive control, especially when the apparent incentives
reward excess.   The  facts  of  what  happened  to  the  quality of rubber
plantings tend to favor the more critical assessment.
54.      More design  effort  should  be  devoted  to creating compensation
formulae that are less distortive - lump  sum fees might have been better -
and that facilitate performance supervision. Short of inviting competitive
bids for PTP (or other) participation, however, the audit can only suggest
that the form of contract that served to focus and discipline PTP exertions
was inappropriate.

C.  Food Cropping
55.      The  design   expectations,   despite   acknowledged  risks,  that
smallholder settlers would grow adequate food crops on the red/yellow
podzolic soils typically encountered at project sites were flawed.
56.      The projects envisaged that  each  settler  family would grow food
crops, mainly for subsistence, on (up to) 3.0 ha, until such time as it
could afford to extend its area of rubber into this part of the holding
using savings or further credit.    Family subsistence was expected to face
the most difficulties during the first six years of settlement, when rubber
plantings (mostly 2 ha per family) were not producing latex. The appraisal
team recognized technical risks in the food crop package, citing the lack
of knowledge of how settlers would grow food crops successfully on red-
yellow podzolic soils.    Although  the  team  settled  for  what it ten ed
conservative crop yields, it recognized that there were still significant
risks.  It argued that these risks were acceptable on the grounds that food
crops accounted (at full development) for only 20% of growers' incomes.
57.      The relative failure of the  food  cropping component in NES I, II
and III raises concern about how the Bank responded during project
preparation to internal reviews of the feasibility of the food cropping
proposals. The proposals adopted in NES I were probably a reasonable risk,
had they been given sufficient  time  to  be tested.  The similar proposals
that were adopted so soon in NES II and, to some extent, in NES III and
subsequent projects in the series, however, assumed increasingly greater
risks. The Bank was to confront more serious project risks with food
cropping, however, in the Transmigration II Project,4/ which was appraised
at about the same time as NES I and II. The design of Transmigration II
envisaged  that  a  similar  range   of  food  crops,  involving  the  same
problematic soils, would become the principal source of settlers' incomes.
Food crops fared badly in that project also. It appears that the decisions
taken on this issue in the NES Projects were heavily influenced by the
higher risk decisions  taken  in  Transmigration  II.    It  would be worth
revisiting this iss e in the context of that operation.
