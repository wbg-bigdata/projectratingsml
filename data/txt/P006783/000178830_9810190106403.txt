POWER DEVELOPMENT FINANCE PROJECT
FINANCIERA ELECTRICA NACIONAL
SUMMARY
The project aims at assisting Colombia during 1984-85 to maintain
the construction rhythm of ongoing electricity development projects, which
will supply the electric energy needed to facilitate growth of industrial and
commercial activities, as well as help supply electricity to a larger segment
of the country's population, only 54% of which now have access to it. The
participation of the international capital market, which had diminished
sharply from past years, has been enlisted in this.l/ The proposed project
also seeks to support the development of FEN, the recently-established finan-
cial arm of the power sector, created to tap domestic and external capital
markets on its behalf. Support is provided under the project to assist FEN
in its role of strengthening power sector financial management. The proposed
project consists of subprojects representing a two-year time-slice of prior-
ity ongoing electricity development investments, several of which are already
partly financed with Bank loans. Criteria and procedures for subproject
selection have been agreed with FEN. Based upon these criteria, a group of
subprojects has been selected on a preliminary basis, with final selection
and sub-loan amounts to be based upon detailed proposals in each case. Sub-
projects will consist of a portion of the civil works, goods and services
associated with the investments, including interest during construction on
existing Bank loans where justified, and the proposed subloans to be made by
FEN to the utilities would finance foreign exchange costs not covered from
other sources. Procurement under the proposed Bank loan, as well as the
Bank's share of the cofinancing loans, would be under international competi-
tive bidding in line with Bank guidelines. The project would be implemented
over a 2-year period, beginning in the second quarter of 1984.
1/ Approval of the Board of Executive Directors of the negotiated terms and
conditions of proposed US$30 million Bank participation in the US$200
million B-loans is to be sought on the basis of President's Memoranda
distributed separately.






1. THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources and Policies
1.01      Colombia is rich in energy resources, particularly hydroelectricity
and coal. Its reserves of oil and natural gas are modest by international
standards, yet significant at the national level. In terms of known
reserves, about 55% of Colombia's primary energy potential lies in hydroelec-
tricity, 40% in coal and only 5% in oil and natural gas. In contrast, con-
sumption of commercial energy relies primarily upon oil products (50%) and
less on natural gas (20%), coal (22%) and hydroelectricity (8%).
1.02      Colombia traditionally enjoyed a positive trade balance in energy
because of its relatively rich energy endowment and modest consumption (at
about one ton of coal equivalent per annum, Colombia's per capita energy con-
sumption is below average for middle-income developing countries). In 1976
the country became a net importer of energy, and by 1981 oil imports reached
almost US$400 million. This came about because of a decline in total domes-
tic energy production, resulting from a 7% annual fall in oil output between
1970 and 1979. As this situation was threatening to compromise balance of
payments prospects, the Government moved in the late-1970s to redress the
negative energy trade balance, through: (i) pricing measures directed at
increasing the overall cost of energy to consumers, at changing relative
prices to encourage consumers to move away from oil, and providing incentives
to producers; and (ii) direct public sector investments in the energy field,
particularly hydroelectricity and coal. As a result, the previous trend has
been reversed since 1980, with energy production increases in petroleum,
aggregate energy consumption growth lower than GDP, and petroleum's total
primary energy consumption falling, while that of hydroelectricity, coal and
natural gas increased.
1.03      Known oil reserves at the end of 1981 totalled about 700 million
barrels, or only about 10 years consumption at present rates of utilization.
Policies pursued during the 1960s and the early 1970s contributed to a dete-
riorating oil situation. Prices to consumers and producers were kept artifi-
cially low, thus promoting consumption and dampening incentives for develop-
ment of new reserves through exploration. In recent years the Government
moved forcefully to remedy this by bringing internal consumer prices closer
to international levels (internal prices were increased by more than three-
fold in real terms between 1974 and 1980, and, lately, have fluctuated around
80-90% of international prices) and by enabling producers to benefit from a
large part of the price increases. As a result, exploration has increased
from 11 wells per year in 1975 to 61 in 1981, with known reserves expanding
by about 10% in 1981, after several years of steady decline. Also, crude oil
production has been increasing at over 5% per annum since 1980. Crude oil
production stood at almost 150,000 bpd at the end of 1982, covering about 80%
of domestic consumption. Since average growth in consumption has not sur-
passed 0.5% per annum during the last five years, self-sufficiency in oil may
be within reach by the mid-1980s. Over the longer term, however, a re-
emergence of oil imports appears likely, as geological prospects for dis-
coveries have been not too encouraging so far.



-2-
1.04      Measured natural gas reserves stood at about 4.2 trillion cubic
feet at the end of 1981, or almost 40 years consumption at present rates of
utilization.  Most reserves, production and consumption are concentrated on
the northern coast, with natural gas being piped to the main population and
industrial centers along the coast.  Growth in gas consumption (which aver-
aged about 7% per annum over the last five years) has been provided a major
push by conversion of some power plants from fuel oil to gas. Thermal power
plants now account for about half of total gas consumption. Industry repre-
sents the bulk of the remainder with oil refineries also important consu-
mers. At present there is significant excess supply in the northern region.
Further important increases in gas consumption are tied largely to several
new gas-processing options currently being studied. The best alternative
appears to be an ammonia-urea plant (the Bank is the Executing Agency for a
UNDP-financed feasibility study).
1.05      As a consequence of the natural gas surplus on the northern coast,
the Government has not yet defined a clear pricing policy for natural gas.
Prices for new deliveries are negotiated ex-post with producers on a case by
case basis. This acts as a disincentive for exploration. Although consumer
prices are currently relatively low (less than US$2 per thousand cubic feet),
the extent to which they result in misallocation of resources is not clear
because the viability of future gas-consuming projects remains to be estab-
lished.
1.06      Colombia's coal resources are substantial, with reserves estimated
at some 16 billion tons, of which only about 20% can be classified as
measured. At present rates of utilization, reserves would last hundreds of
yearsz In view of the magnitude of reserves, Government policy is to encour-
age domestic consumption in substitute for natural gas and fuel oil, and to
promote coal exports, mainly from El Cerrejon but also from other deposits
located near the Atlantic Coast. Since 1979, the UNDP and the Bank have been
working jointly with the State coal corporation, CARBOCOL, that together with
an EXXON subsidiary is developing a 15-mtpy production from El Cerrejon
North. A proposed Bank-financed Coal Exploration Project will assist in
assessing the economic potential of several other promising areas in the
Atlantic and Central Regions.
1.07      Coal production grew at about 7% per annum on average over the
1970s to reach a level of about 5 million tons in 1981. Production came from
about 400 small and medium-scale mines, virtually all of which are non-
mechanized, run by the private sector and located in Central Colombia. More
than half the production and consumption of coal is concentrated in the high-
lands near Bogota. Sixty percent of all coal is consumed by industry, and
most of the rest by the power sector. Residential consumption and exports
represent only a small share of total output. Colombian coal is bituminous,
of high calorific value (mostly over 6,000 kcal/kg) and with low sulphur con-
tent (mostly less than 1%). Some coal in central Colombia possesses coking
properties. In 1982, domestic coal prices, which are freely set by market
forces, typically ranged between US$25-35 per ton delivered to large consu-
mers in the industrial centers of Bogota, Medellin and Cali. This is well
below international prices, but high internal transport costs imposed by the
long distance to ports and difficult terrain all but rule out for now coal
exports from the interior of the country.



-3-
1.08      Colombia's hydroelectric potential, at about 100 GW, is amongst the
largest in the world. Although the country has made strides in developing
this potential (hydroelectric power generation grew at about 10% per annum
during the 1970s), total installed hydro-capacity by end-1982 was less than
4 GW. However, plants now under construction will virtually double capacity
by 1989. Hydroelectric plants currently represent about 70% of total
electric power generation and thermal plants the rest. The largest part of
the thermal capacity is located on the northern coast, where hydro potential
is limited, but where there is abundant coal and natural gas. Since the
plentiful hydro-reserves can be developed at relatively low cost, they
represent an option of high priority. However, the optimal mix of hydro and
coal and gas-fired plants needs to be determined in order to take advantage
of the projected increased supply of coal and the existing availability of a
natural gas surplus. This matter is currently being studied (para. 1.20).
Investment and Financial Issues
1.09      In Colombia, electricity, petroleum and natural gas prices are set
by the Government; coal prices are market-set. In spite of positive Govern-
ment actions in recent years, there is still a need to develop long-term
pricing policies that reflect the opportunity cost of the various energy
resources and provide, within the Government's broader objectives, appro-
priately balanced incentives for the development of energy resources.   It is
not clear whether current prices actually provide such incentives. The
absence of adequate knowledge about some of the investment requirements of
different energy sources, particularly coal, has made it difficult to set out
an integrated investment program and adequate incentives for each subsector.
Towards this end, the Government has undertaken a major effort to improve
sector knowledge through a National Energy Study (ENE), the first stage of
which was carried out between 1979 and 1982 by the National Planning Depart-
ment (DNP) with the help of local consultants and technical assistance from
UNDP and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). The report on ENE's first
stage is under Government review at present. This study provides significant
information needed for energy planning, including preliminary evaluation of
energy demand growth and investments that could best serve such growth. How-
ever, much work remains to be done, particularly in the selection of alterna-
tive energy sources. A second stage of the ENE is now commencing with
several specialized studies.l/ The current effort has already elicited
foreign technical assistance from official sources. The FRG will be provid-
ing assistance on modeling and data gathering, France on industrial energy
savings, Italy on rural electrification, and the Organization of American
States (OAS) on energy use in transportation. Several energy sector agencies
and the Ministry of Public Works will provide counterpart staff and DNP will
coordinate the external assistance. Finally, in support of Government
efforts to sharpen its energy investment strategy, the Bank is preparing to
carry out a study on selective issues through the energy assessment program
financed by UNDP.
1.10      Over the past five years, Colombia has been successful in mobiliz-
ing external resources to finance energy development. This has been achieved
/  Among others, studies on natural gas available for ammonia-urea fertili-
zer production and the aforementioned coal exploration studies.



-4-
through direct foreign investment (in oil and gas first and lately in coal)
and external loans to the energy agencies, including power companies. How-
ever, the current conditions in the international lending markets are making
external financing more difficult to obtain. Local financing requirements
are covered by internally generated resources and Government contributions,
with the incipient local capital market providing to date only a marginal
share of financing.  In order to increase internal resource mobilization by
the main energy sector agencies, prices charged to consumers of petroleum
products and electricity have been significantly increased in real terms.
Furthermore, in 1980 the Government created the National Coal Fund (FNC) that
receives revenue from a tax on coal production valued at the mine-head, which
is currently allocated to finance coal exploration (80%) and to assist small
and medium-scale coal mining operations (20%). In 1982 a power development
bank--the borrower for the proposed project--was established to mobilize
domestic as well as foreign credit for the power sector.
Institutional Arrangements in the Power Sector
1.11      Through the 1950s, a large number of power companies were set up by
local governmental authorities and, lacking interconnection with each other,
were operated independently in response to regional and departmental needs.
Some 14 years ago, the country's total electricity ca acity stood at a mere
1,681 MW (equivalent to about 88 watts per inhabitant) and reached only about
'35% of the population. Although large hydropower sites held the potential of
iincreasing substantially the supply of electricity at lower cost than other-
wise possible, they were too big to be tapped in any one company. With en-
couragement from the Bank, the Government persuaded the regional power compa-
nies to break with tradition and pool their resources in a shared effort to
develop the country's large hydroelectric potential. To accomplish this,
Interconexion Electrica, S.A. (ISA) was created as an independent, national
generation and interconnection company, of which the shareholders now include
atll the largest municipal power util ties and the Government-owned power com-
panies. In addition to plant construction, ISA has integrated the regional
power systems. At the same time, the Government has taken measures to
improve the sector's prospects for efficient growth; it established the
National Tariff Board (JNT) in DNP to approve requests from the power compa-
nies for tariff increases, and it fostered the consolidation of numerous
small utilities, particularly in the North Atlantic Region. The Bank parti-
cipated actively in the creation of both ISA and JNT.
1.12      At present, public electricity service is provided by:
(a) municipally-owned companies, independent of the National Govern-
ment, of which the largest are Empresa de Energia Electrica de
Bogota (EEEB), Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM), and Empresas
Municipales de Cali (EMCALI);
(b) national enterprises such as Instituto Colombiano de Energia
Electrica (ICEL), and Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Cauca
(CVC), and the Corporacion Electrica de la Costa Atlantica
(CORELCA). ICEL and CORELCA have a total of 21 electrificadoras,
subsidiaries which mainly distribute power at the local level; and



-5-
(d) a generating and transmission company, ISA, the main shareholders
of which are EEEB, EPM, CVC, ICEL and CORELCA.
The Ministry of Mines and Energy owns part of the sector directly through
ICEL and CORELCA. EEEB and EPM, currently the largest utilities, are con-
trolled by autonomous municipal governments. CVC reports to DNP. A brief
description of each principal utility follows below.
1.13      ISA.  Established in 1967 as a public corporation, ISA has provided
a cohesive framework for sector development by creating a national grid
capable of transmitting large amounts of power and energy among the
shareholders who, in turn distribute the energy to consumers in the region of
Colombia. By ISA's undertaking development of large hydroelectric resources
on behalf of its shareholders, they have been able to share the costs and
benefits of the country'slow-cost hydropower potential, which is
geographically concentrated in the areas of Bogota (EEEB) and Medellin
(EPM). The holdings of ISA's shareholders as of December 31, 1983, are:

Headquartered in Medellin, ISA is administered by its Shareholder Assembly, a
5-member Board of Directors and a General Manager supported by a competent
technical staff. The Assembly must act on all major issues and, to ensure
that decisions are based on a consensus, ISA's Bylaws specify that the Share-
holders Assembly achieve the concurrence of 75% of the shares. Decision-
making tends to be slow when the interests of the various shareholders
differ. ISA has constructed 500 MW Chivor I (681-C0, 1972) and 500 MW
Chivor II hydro plants, as well as 66 MW of thermal capacity at Zipaquira and
133 M4W of gas turbine capacity at Chinu. It also has under construction the
1,240 MW San Carlos I and II hydro plants and the 18 MW Calderos hydro
plant (1582-C0, 1978, and 1725-CO, 1981) for 1984/85 operation, the Jaguas
hydro plant (170 MW) for 1984 and the fifth unit at the Zipaquira thermal
plant (66 MW) for 1985.
1.14      EEEB.  An autonomous company, EEEB is owned by the Municipality of
the Special District of Bogota, which generates, transmits and distributes
electricity. It serves some 622,000 consumers in metropolitan Bogota direct-
ly and sells power in bulk to a local distributor in the department of
Cundinamarca. EEEB is administered by a 7-member Board of Directors and a
General Manager. The Mayor of Bogota, or his representative, serves as the
Chairman of the Board of Directors. The General Manager, who is responsible



-6-
for the day-to-day management of the company, is appointed by the Board sub-
ject to the Mayor's approval. EEEB's management is adequate for the execu-
tion of its expansion program and for the operation of its facilities.  EEEB
has an installed capacity of 711 MW (581 MW hydro and 130 MW thermal).   The
company has under construction the 600 MW Mesitas (1628-CO, 1979), now
nearing completion, and the 1,000 MW Guavio hydro projects (2008-CO, 1982),
as well as a Bogota Distribution project (1807-CO, 1981).
1.15      EPM.  An autonomous company, EPM is owned by the Municipality of
Medellin, which provides power, water, sewerage, and telephone services for
the city of Medellin and vicinity. It serves some 350,000 power consumers in
metropolitan Medellin and sells in bulk to a distributing company in the
department of Antioquia. EPM, a well-managed company, is headed by a
7-member Board of Directors and a General Manager. The Mayor of Medellin, or
his representative, is the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The various
services of EPM are managed as separate entities with separate accounting
systems. EPM has an installed capacity of 1,002 MW which will increase to
1,215 MW with the completion of the Guadalupe IV project in 1985. The Bank
is providing financing for Guadalupe IV (1868-CO, 1981) and the 200 MW Playas
hydro project (1953-CO, 1982), the latter expected to be in operation in
1987.
1.16      CVC.  An autonomous multipurpose State corporation under DNP, CVC
is responsible for developing the Cauca Valley and has been discharging its
mandate with notable success. One of its main activities is generating and
transmitting power in the Valley, undertaken in part through CHIDRAL, which
is owned by CVC (65%), the Municipality of Cali (17%) and EMCALI (18%).
CVC-CHIDRAL sells power in bulk to EMCALI and other distributing companies
(subsidiaries of ICEL and CVC) serving a total of some 400,000 consumers.
CVC is administered by a 7-member Board of Directors and an Executive
Director appointed by the President of the Republic. CVC's various activi-
ties are managed as separate enterprises with independent accounting sys-
tems. CVC-CHIDRAL has received five fully-disbursed loans from the Bank
totalling MUS$44.6 (the last of which was made in 1963). It has an installed
capacity of 616 MW (571 MW hydro, 45 MW thermal). CVC's multipurpose
Salvajina project (intended mainly for flood control and irrigation), when
completed in 1984, will provide 270 MW of generating capacity and correspond-
inqg transmission facilities.
1.17      CORELCA.  An autonomous corporation, since 1972 CORELCA has been
responsible for power generation and transmission in 7 departments of the
Atlantic Coast. The 8 distributing companies in the area are subsidiaries of
CORELCA and buy power in bulk from it. Together they have an installed capa-
city of 766 MW (all thermal) and serve about 456,000 consumers. A 170 MW
steam station fueled by coal from El Cerrejon is to be commissioned in 1983,
and a second 170 mw unit is being installed for 1985 operation. CORELCA is
administered by a 7-member Board of Directors and a Managing Director. Its
management, organization and supervision of its subsidiaries have improved
considerably over the last 10 years. It has implemented satisfactorily
construction programs within its service area that included thermal plants
with units in the range of 150 M1, high voltage interconnecting transmission
lines, and distribution system expansion and works to improve its operating
efficiency.



1.18      ICEL.  A Government institute, ICEL reports to the Ministry of
Mines and Energy and provides electric power services largely to small towns
and rural areas of the country not served by the other main utilities. It
does so with the assistance of Government contributions through 13 subsidiary
companies in which it is the majority shareholder (the others are the respec-
tive local governments). ICEL's subsidiaries have an installed capacity of
663 MW (391 MW hydro, 272 MW thermal) and serve about 1,013,000 customers.
ICEL and some of its subsidiaries are expanding generation facilities, the
largest of which are the Betania hydro plant (for which a separate institu-
tion under ICEL's sponsorship has been created) which is to add 500 MW to the
national system in 1986-and the Tasajero thermal plant (150 MW) expected to
go into operation in 1984. ICEL is also responsible for the investment pro-
gram of most of its subsidiaries, comprising essentially expansion of the
various subtransmission and distribution systems and their connection to the
interconnected system, together with generating additions to isolated
systems. The projects carried out by ICEL are generally transferred to its
subsidiaries in the form of capital contributions. ICEL is administered by a
5-member Board of Directors (chaired by the Minister of Mines and Energy) and
a General Manager appointed by the President of the Republic. ICEL and its
subsidiaries have organizational and administrative problems, resulting from
frequent changes in middle management, low salaries, lack of qualified staff,
poor accounting systems and insufficient control by ICEL over the operations
of the geographically dispersed subsidiaries. A recently completed study on
organizational components by ICEL's Administrative Advisory Unit is expected
to initiate activities to resolve these problems (para. 4.12).
Planning and Coordination
1.19      The Ministry of Mines and Energy is charged with formulating
national policy for the generation, transmission and distribution of electri-
city, including coordination and supervision of power sector planning. It
shares with the National Social and Economic Policy Council (CONPES), DNP and
ISA responsibility for defining investment priorities. ISA defines a genera-
tion and transmission expansion program for the interconnected system; after
approval by the Ministry, DNP and CONPES, this becomes the National Power
Expansion Program. The Program is reviewed annually by ISA and revisions, if
necessary, are proposed. On the basis of requests from the companies, JNT in
DNP approves rate increases. Although the Government cannot enforce its
policies directly on the municipally controlled power companies, a mechanism
for reaching agreement on major issues affecting the sector is provided by
ISA, in which the Government has major holdings through ICEL and CORELCA.
Sector planning and coordination have improved markedly since the creation of
ISA, and the Bank has strongly supported this evolution through its lending.
National Least-Cost Power Expansion Program
1.20      Colombia has shared in the world-wide economic recession over the
last years and, over the same period, has effected upward adjustments in
electricity tariffs 44% in excess of the consumer price index (para. 1.23).
Taking account of the consequent slowing of electricity demand growth, on May
26, 1983, CONPES approved a revised National Power Expansion Program for
plants entering service during 1987-96 (Annex 1.2), representing a 31% reduc-
tion in investment expenditures previously planned during 1983-86. The plan
is based upon a phased resumption of the average annual economic growth rate



- 8 -
of 5.5% achieved from 1965-80, estimated fuel prices and the satisfying of a
conisequent projected 7.9% average annual electricity demand growth during the
17--year period 1983-2000. (Electricity demand growth has historically corre-
lated closely to overall economic growth at an elasticity ratio of 1.5.) For
the first time in Colombia, this plan also takes account of the probability
of construction delays based upon recent experience in constructing the coun-
try's first large hydro facilities. One-year delays are assumed in comple-
tion of all plants that will become operative after 1987 and provision is
made for maintaining a 95% reliability factor.2/ This plan would satisfac-
torily meet projected demand through year 2000.  During 1983, actual
electricity demand on the interconnected system rose by 7.2%, compared to the
1982 demand and to the 3.5% projected in the plan for the whole of 1983 over
the previous year. To ensure that significant variations in demand are
suitably taken into account, the Program should be annually reviewed and
updlated, as provided by CONPES. The next review is expected to be completed
by April 30, 1984. Thereafter, updating should be carried out in
coordination with the sector financing strategy review discussed in para.
5.13. Thus, during negotiations of the proposed loan, agreement was reached
that by September 30 of each year beginning in 1984, ISA would update, and
the Government would subsequently review together with the Bank, electricity
demand growth projections and the associated investment program. In support
of ISA's efforts to strengthen its planning methodology, a UNDP-financed
study, for which the Bank is the executing agency, has recently been
initiated, focusing mainly on demand forecasting and hydrological aspects.
The current Program adopted at the national level on May 26, 1983 has been
used as the basis for the financial projections in this report.
Power Market and Supply3!
1.21       Electric power has become the fastest-growing form of energy use in
Colombia. Its share of total energy consumption has almost doubled from 6.5%
in 1970 to 11.4% in 1980.  Generation increased by an average of about 10%
annually during 1970-1980, although it has slowed over the last years to 5.4%
per annum in 1981-82 (para 1.23). Annual per capita generation in 1982 was
about 750 kWh, which is below average for Latin America. Effective installed
capacity at the end of that year was 4,835 MW on the interconnected system
2/ In the unlikely event that all plants would be completed without the
one-year delay, the system would have the capacity to meet an 8.5%
average annual growth at a 95% reliability factor.

and 5,077 MW including self-producers, indicating the public entities
accounting for 95% of the total installed capacity and generation.
Diversified peak demand was about 3,854 MW, and total energy generation in
1982 amounted to 21,525 GWh, of which 21,300 GWh was supplied by ISA and its
shareholders. Hydro plants accounted for about 69% of the total energy
generation.
1.22      About 54% of Colombia's 26.7 million population has electric power,
compared to 26% in 1950 and 45% in 1970. The urban population, comprising
about 68% of the population, has greater access. In 1976, for example, 90%
of households in large cities (population of 50,000 or more) had electrical
service while in rural towns (population between 500-2,500) the corresponding
figure was 36%; in other rural areas, 13%. Various programs including the
Bank-financed First and Second Integrated Rural Development Projects and the
Village Electrification Project as well as programs financed by IDB,
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) and the Colombia Coffee Growers Associa-
tion, are aimed at increasing rural coverage (see also para. 1.09). In 1982
there were about 2.8 million electricity subscribers of which 88.5% were
residential and 9.2% commercial. Electricity sales in 1982 totalled about
16,708 GWh4/. Consumption by consumer category is shown in Annex 1.3.
1.23      During 1970-1982 gross generation increased at an average annual
rate of about 9.2%, compared to the 10% annual average during the 1970s
(Annex 1.3). The slower generation growth rate was brought about by economic
recession in 1981 that affected adversely all economic sectors in Colombia,
compounded by drought conditions that reduced generation from the hydro
plants and resulted in consequent power restrictions and brownouts in the
cities. Tariff increases on the order of 15-20% above the consumer price
index throughout the sector in that year may have further suppressed demand.
Growth of total sales decreased proportionally. As mentioned previously, the
new National Power Expansion Program takes account of these factors. The
system demand forecast for total gross generation for 1983-1990 anticipated a
rise from 23.1 TWh to 38.8 TWh (Annex 1.4). Demand for gross generation was
forecast to grow at about 7.9% on average annually, with the system load
factor expected to remain constant at 64% during the period. Maximum system
MW demand is expected to increase from 4,120 MW in 1983 to 6,921 in 1990,
reflecting an average annual increase of about 7.7%. System losses were
assumed at about 20% of losses.5/ The installation of about 5,318 MW is
planned during 1983-92 to meet forecast demands. System load factor is
expected to remain constant during the period at 64%.
Recent Developments
1.24      During the past three years the sector has suffered financial
problems caused mainly by lower than expected revenues resulting from tariff
adjustment delays, slow demand growth, rationing, and higher than expected
local cost shares of investments as well as insufficient availability of
financing. Local borrowings needed by the sector have outpaced the domestic

by each of the companies result from the usage of differing loss
percentages and other adjustments made after the Energy Balance had been
published by ISA.

banking system's lending capability. Moreover, Government-related lending
earmarked for the sector was held back and monetization of external borrow-
ings was authorized only on a highly selective basis.
1.25      As a result, when the current national administration took office
in August 1982 the sector's financing deficit for the year was estimated to
amount to US$430 million and the previously-favorable lending climate for
Colombia in the international capital market became affected by developments
in other Latin American countries and began to deteriorate. In the Fall of
1982, the authorities moved quickly to review the sector financing plan and
to authorize badly-needed tariff increases for EEEB (a 22% lump increase and
3.25% monthly, amounting to 73% during the next 12 months) and EPM (a 20%
one-time adjustment and continuance of 2.2% a month, or 52% over the same
period) and to adopt a financing program to cover the sector's 1982 short-
fall, as well as the afcre-mentioned new borrowings needed in 1983-84.  In
doing so, the authorities have also recognized the constraint on sound sector
development and finances represented by the 12 mostly rural-based local uti-
lities loosely grouped under the holding company, ICEL. The Government,
therefore, confirmed explicitly the need to restructure the ICEL-group
(para. 5.08) and also to take special measures, still to be defined, to
assist the Atlantic Coast regional company, CORELCA, in strengthening the
eight coastal utilities under its wing. (The one negative development on
this score was a short-lived countrywide tariff freeze, in late 1982, follow-
ing civil disturbances associated with electricity charges to consumers and
quality of service.) Further, studies were initiated on the possiblity of
inter-regional unification of tariff structures over the long term. In addi-
tion to tariff measures, the authorities took other decisive actions to mobi-
lize needed local resources. Legislative and other regulatory measures were
enacted to put the new financial arm of the power sector, FEN (Chapter 2), on
an operational footing. As a result of a well-orchestrated effort by the
Government, FEN and private sector managers in the financial system, FEN
attracted considerable private financial savings in its initial placement
(para. 2.13), and the first loans to the power companies have been finalized.
1.26      Through the exercise of defining the sectoral financing program,
for the first time in recent years the Government began to come to grips with
the macroeconomic and institutional implications of the 1983-90 power invest-
ment program.  In May 1983, it reviewed in detail the justification for, and
financial feasibility of all new investments in the aforementioned program,
taking account of competing demands from other priority sectors, with conse-
quent reduction by almost one-third of planned capital outlays for electri-
city (para. 1.20). The new authorities have thus set a course of managing
more directly the impact of electricity development on the rest of the eco-
nomv through careful assessment of proposed investment programs in terms of
economic and technical soundness, compatibility with overall public invest-
ment: expenditure plans, and financial feasibility at the national and
sectoral level.  This approach would help avoid the severe cash flow
difficulties of recent years. Moreover, it would bring under regular
scrutiny those investments undertaken by individual companies that do not



come under the aegis of the National Power Expansion Program (which includes
generation plant and transmission lines, but not subtransmission or distribu-
tion), thereby contributing to the efficiency of resource allocation. The
proposed project would support this evolution by helping to mobilize
resources and assisting the Government to review on a regular basis the
justification for new investments, the sector's financial performance and
investment capability (paras. 2.28-2.29, 4.08 and 5.13). During negotia-
tions, assurance was received that new electricity development projects would
be authorized by the Government only if the project in question would be eco-
nomically justified and there would be available adequate financing that
would not affect negatively the existing financial obligations of the
company(ies) concerned.
Bank Participation
1.27      Since 1950, the Banik has made 27 loans to Colombia's power sector,
totalling US$1,374 million (Annex 1.5). In addition, the Bank is assisting
with the preparation of three generation and transmission projects now at the
feasibility stage: Rio Grande Multipurpose project (water supply and power,
EPM), Calima III Hydro Power (CVC) and Urra (Alto Sinu) Hydro Power (CORELCA
and ISA). Past loans have assisted the expansion of generating capacity, and
transmission and distribution facilities in the systems serving Bogota,
Medellin, Cali, Cartagena, Bucaramanga and Manizales, including expansion of
electricity distribution to low income areas (874-CO, 1973; 1807-CO, 1980;
and 1868-CO, 1980). The Bogota Distribution Project (1807-CO, 1981) has been
the first Bank loan to Colombia to support exclusively distribution expansion
and, in addition to other beneficiaries, would directly benefit about 340,000
lower income consumers. In addition, the Bank has supported rural electrifi-
cation under 246-CO (1960) and 313-CO (1962), the First and Second Integrated
Rural Development Project (1352-CO, 1977; 2174-CO, 1983), and the Village
Electrification Project (1999-CO, 1983). Other recent loans included the
500-kV Interconnection Line (1583-CO, 1978), and for hydro power generation,
the San Carlos I and II (Loans 1582-CO, 1978; 1725-CO, 1979), Mesitas
(1628-CO, 1979), Guadalupe IV (1868-CO, 1980), Playas (1953-CO, 1981) and
Guavio Projects (2008-CO, 1982) which would, respectively, complete the task
of interconnecting the country's regional power systems begun under 575-CO
(1968), and add a total of 3,253 MW of capacity to the national interconnect-
ed system. In addition to coordinating a technical assistance project to
strengthen system planning (para. 1.20), the Bank is the executing agency for
another UNDP-financed project which would enhance the sector's construction
management capability for large hydroelectric facilities. Further, in
connection with Bank lending, marginal cost tariff studies have been carried
out for the major markets by ISA's shareholders. The adaption of the results
of the study into the various tariff structures is under discussion with the
Government. Taken together, the above-mentioned projects reflect the Bank's
participation in overall power development in Colombia, from the planning
stage through financing and construction of generation and transmission faci-
lities, to delivery of service to the final consumer. Finally, as part of
its continuing dialogue with the Government and the sector, the Bank is plan-
ning a power sector memorandum for 1984 which would address the full energy
balance and expansion planning (para. 1.20), load dispatch, power losses
(para. 1.23), sector organization (para. 1.25), salaries and training, and
financing strategy (para. 5.13).

1. 28     Previous Bank lending to Colombia's power sector has been found
generally successful in several OED reports. For instance, the most recent
report, "Power Interconnection (575-CO) and Chivor Hydroelectric Projects
(681-CO)" (Report No. 2720, October 29, 1979), commented upon the Bank's
participation in Colombia's effort to evolve a stronger and more efficient
power sector organization. Through the creation of ISA in conjunction with
these projects, and the steps taken to overcome financial and institutional
difficulties, real progress was made toward more coordinated sector develop-
ment. Despite implementation delays and increased costs, both projects were
successfully implemented. Also, the report entitled "Bank Operations in
Colombia, an Evaluation" (Report No. Z-18) of May 25, 1972, concluded that
Bank financing was successful in assisting the power companies to develop
hydroelectric plants at lower unit cost than they otherwise would have been
able to do. In turn, this permitted greater urban coverage as well as
cheaper and more reliable electricity supply to industry. The report com-
mended Bank efforts in the establishment of JNT and the central intercon-
nected system, which facilitated further power sector development. Among
other things, the report recommended that in the future the Bank pay
increased attention to the companies' financial planning, tariff structures,
distribution programs and energy losses. These points have been addressed
under the aforementioned recent loans, which have been the first Bank opera-
tions since late 1972 because sector financial difficulties precluded needed
expansion of generation facilities in the interim. Complementary measures to
sustain investment capability, and thus ensure completion of high priority
projects in a reasonable period, and to strengthen financial planning are a
main focus of the proposed project.

2. THE BORROWER, THE FINANCIERA ELECTRICA NACIONAL
Introduction
2.01      Given the structure and relatively small size of Colombia's
financial institutions (Chapter 3), by 1981 it had become evident that the
rapid growth over the previous three years of the power sector's requirements
for medium and long-term local currency financing could not be adequately
met. Further, the large volume of resources involved also implied a need for
a specialized institution to oversee the sector's finances, coordinate an
overall financing strategy and monitor the economic efficiency with which
loan proceeds were used. In conjunction with the Guavio Hydro Power Project
(2008-CO), the Government confirmed its intention to set up such an
institution. In an important elaboration of the original concept, the
Colombian authorities decided to empower the new entity to raise capital in
external as well as local market to enable concentrating on substantial share
of overall resource mobilization for the sector, with attendant economies.
Thus, FEN was established by Law 11 of January 1982 and Decree 1471 of May
1982, as a financial entity of the State with a share capital subscribed by
the Nation and, initially, six power companies operating at the national,
departmental and municipal levels. FEN is encharged with:
(a)  structuring and coordinating power sector finances;
(b)  making medium and long-term loans (1 to 20 years) exclusively to
its shareholding electric utilities;
(c)  mobilizing domestic savings by financial paper issues and other in-
struments after obtaining authorization from the National Monetary
Board;
(d)  mobilizing external resources, subject to the pertinent regulations
pertaining to public entities; and
(e)  administering for its shareholding electric utilities bond issues
and trusts, and guarantee, agent or payment contracts, and opening
letters of credit.
Although FEN is an independent financial institution, both the Government and
the sector companies participate in its policy decisions. Through exercise
of its mandate, FEN is expected to play an important role, not only in
providing financing but also in extending timely guidance to the utilities on
financial management issues and in advising the Government on national policy
matters related to the sector's ability to carry out high priority
investments. Toward this end, under the proposed project FEN will carry out
annually a review of sector finances and investment financing strategy
(para. 5.13).
Legal Status
2.02      FEN's legal status is sui generis, that is, although it is under
the general jurisdiction of the Superintendency of Banks, its characteristics
and regulatory framework are those specifically assigned to it. By virtue of



- 14 -
the role it is to play, this unique status is necessary.  For example, FEN is
the only state enterprise in Colombia devoted to providing finance to a sub-
group of its shareholders; the only rediscount development bank outside the
Central Bank (Banco de la Republica, BR); the only bank whose lending activi-
ties are restricted to a single sector composed of public companies; and it
is one of the largest financial institutions in the country, with a capital
base equivalent to about 20% of the total banking system. Therefore, FEN
requires a suitably tailored control system to avoid conflict of interest,
and to provide appropriate liquidity, solvency and operating parameters.
This has been provided for (paras. 2.27-2.29), although further refinements
may be introduced as experience is gained (para. 2.03).
Organization, Administration and Personnel
2.03      FEN's main shareholders comprise the National Government, ISA,
EEEB, EPM, CVC, ICEL, CHEC, and CORELCA, who form its General Assembly
(para. 2.08). It is managed by a Board of Directors and a General Manager.
The Board is chaired by the Minister of Mines and Energy and its remaining
members are the Chief of the National Planning Department, the General
Manager of the BR and three representatives of the power company sharehold-
ers. The General Manager is elected by the Board for a two-year, renewable
term. Provision is also made for an independent auditor, elected by the
General Assembly on a biannual, renewable basis (para. 2.06). These arrange-
ments are satisfactory. FEN's Bylaws cover the important aspects of the
entity's role and operations and are acceptable; changes require executive
Government approval. Any change in the legal framework by which FEN was set
up or in its Bylaws, that would have a material and adverse effect upon the
entity, would constitute an event of default under the proposed A-loan.
2.04      The General Manager, an economist and former Dean of Economics at
Universidad Externado de Colombia, credit manager of Caja Agraria, and
ministrial advisor, took up his duties in 1982 and has made strong progress
in internal organization, personnel recruitment, public relations, initial
mobilization of financial savings and in general assessment of the new insti-
tution's role and policies. FEN's organizational plan (Chart) provides for a
small staff of professionally-qualified people, initially about 20.  Core
professional staff of about 25 are in place and are well qualified.
Permanent staff will be complemented by consultants, at least in the legal
and tax fields. The organization is divided into five areas:
(a)  General Secretariat:  includes the legal and public relations func-
tions (e.g., coordination with the Government and power sector);
(b)  Administration:  responsible for the management of non-financial
assets and personnel;
(c)  Finance:  covers planning and budgeting, treasury and portfolio
management, accounting and marketing;
(d)  Technical:  responsible for loans and rediscounts, and sector
analysis and studies, such as forecasting and monitoring of finan-
cial performance of the FEN and the electric sector, formulating
financial policy and action proposals for the Government and for
the sector; and



- 15 -
(e) External Operations: charged with all matters related to foreign
financial transactions.
2.05      FEN's organization is well suited to its objectives, and its con-
cept of a small, qualified professional group supported by outside consul-
tants would favor efficiency. FEN has recognized that there are two areas in
which additional staff or temporary consultants with permanent staff members
as counterparts, would be useful:
(a) to enable FEN to administer efficiently the proposed project, and
to strengthen its technical capacity in evaluating loan proposals
and in project monitoring. Toward this end, FEN has agreed to
engage by June 30, 1984, the services of consultants with qualifi-
cations and experience satisfactory to the bank. In addition to
providing technical assistance to FEN's existing staff, the consul-
tants will also carry out, by December 31, 1984, and under terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank, a study of FEN's technical
staffing requirements. Based upon the study's recommendations and
the Bank's comments, FEN would employ the additional experienced
and qualified staff indicated; and
(b) to design the FEN's operating procedures, including the techniques
of systems analysis, down to the level of flow charts, to facili-
tate its later computerization. Personnel are also needed to
determine the hardware and main software for FEN's computer facili-
ties. FEN needs to be able to process not only its own operations
and financial planning but also the cash flow for power projects,
and historical and projected financial statements of the electric
utilities and of the sector as a whole. For this purpose, FEN has
recently employed 3 professional staff, including the former
Director of Systems Analysis of DNP, as well as assistant-level
staff. FEN will proceed with installation of computer facilities
compatible with those of the power companies as soon as possible
(para. 4.08).
Accounting and Auditing
2.06      FEN is in process of organizing its internal accounting and audit-
ing offices. Initial evidence of their work is positive. During negotiation
of the proposed loan it was confirmed that systems compatible with sound
principles will be maintained. FEN has also agreed to retain the services of
independent, external auditors satisfactory to the Bank, in line with the
usual Bank requirements.
Financial Operations
2.07      Sources of Funds.  FEN has four main sources of funds:  its own
capital, official funds, and resources obtained from the domestic and exter-
nal capital markets, together with retained earnings. During negotiations,
agreement was reached that FEN will annually capitalize its profits.



- 16 -
2. 08      Capital.  As of June 15, 1983, FEN's subscribed share and capital
structure comprised: L/
Value         Percent
Shares     (Col$ million)       of Total
The Nation        96,907           9,691            94.0
ISA                2,878             288              3.0
EEEB                  553              55             0.5
EPM                  553               55             0.5
CVC                   553              55             0.5
CORELCA              553               55             0.5
ICEL                 553               55             0.5
CHEC                 553               55             0.5
103,103          10,309           100.0
By far the largest source of FEN's capital is the contribution of COL$9,691
million, in the form of promissory notes endorsed by the Government to FEN
corresponding to the discount value of the Electricity Development Fund's
(FDE) outstanding credits. The accrual of these monies to FEN was estimated
at Col$1,300 million in 1982, Col$3,591 million in 1983, and Col$4,900
million in 1984. (As of December 31, 1983, Col$5,095.4 million had been
received by FEN). By December 31, 1983, in excess of Col$10,300 million of
the subscribed capital had been paid. FEN's actual and projected net worth
and capital resources through 1987 are shown in Annexes 2.3 and 2.4. Net
worth is projected to increase from Col$10,148 million in 1982 to Col$30,595
million in 1987, or about 25% per annum on average.
2.09       From the operational point of view, FEN's capital provides a sub-
stantial amount of funds at zero financial cost to FEN. It also sets the
ceiling to the entity's obligations with the public which, as set out in its
Bylaws, may not exceed 20 times its paid-in capital plus legal reserves. To
protect its capital from being eroded by inflation, avoid a net transfer of
resources from the power sector to the Government and enable FEN to lend to
the power companies at reasonable rates, legislation has been enacted to
exempt the entity's income from taxation.
2.10       Official Funds.  In past years virtually all the medium-to-long
term local borrowings available to the power sector were based upon official
funds (para. 3.20) channelled through the now-defunct Electricity Development
Fund (FDE) of BR. To provide some continued access to such funds, Law 11, by
1/  In June 1983, FEN's General Assembly of Shareholders voted to increase
its share capital by 600 units. 553 of the new shares have been divided
among the electrificadoras of ICEL (182 shares) and CORELCA (126), Emcali
(45), and Central Hidroelectrica de Betania (200), S.A., thus including
Colombia's remaining power companies among FEN shareholders and admitting
them to national-level sectoral discussions, albeit appropriately as
minor shareholders. The other 47 new shares have been subscribed by the
founding shareholders, comprising 27 by ISA and 4 each by EEEB, CVC,
CORELCA, ICEL and CHEC.



- 17 -
which FEN was established, provided that the entity receive 30%2 of the
proceeds of the Social Security Institute's (ISS) Constant Value Bonds that
were previously managed by the Industrial Development Institute (IFI) to
provide financing for goods and services provided locally. These monies,
which may be used for the same purpose by FEN's shareholders, accrue monthly
to FEN, and are to be repaid over 25 years at 5.5 percentage points over
their inflation-adjusted value. Since 1979 the amount of these funds managed
by IFI has more than doubled, reaching Col$2,328 million in 1982; FEN is
expected to receive about Col$7,301 million from this source over 1984-87
(Annex 2.5). In addition, by resolution of the Monetary Board, BR has been
authorized to invest Col$3,000 million in FEN paper, which is expected to be
effected in 1984, and the funds reinvested as they mature.
Also, CONPES has recommended that FEN receive 4% of the annual increase of
incremental legal reserves in BR's credit certificates, which had previously
been directed to the power sector through the FDE; however, this is expected
to comprise only a minor source of funds (Annex 2.5).
2.11      Domestic Capital Market.  Local investors are to be a main source
of funding for FEN.  To tap this market, FEN is empowered, inter alia, to
emit bonds, sell promissory notes, term certificates of deposit, and other
financial paper, and place shares and bonds issued by power companies.
Although the financing requirements of the power sector are mainly for
medium- and long-term loans, current tax regulations and the inflationary
environment do not favor the raising of medium- and long-term funds in the
domestic capital market.
2.12      Given Colombian investors' strong orientation toward short-term
paper, it may take some time for FEN to be able to attract substantial
mediumr and long-term investments, even if there would be favorable tax
treatment. In the interim, this implies a considerable reliance on term
transformation, i.e., borrowing short and lending long. However, the
FEN has not yet been provided with access to short-term borrowing from BR to
cushion it against an unexpected drop in savings mobilization, similar to
that available to the commercial and development banks, and savings and loan
associations. To ensure that an adequate quota would be timely available, it
should be assigned prior to loan effectiveness in an amount and on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. An acceptable arrangement would be to
include FEN among the financial institutions covered by Resolution 72 of
December 1, 1982 of the Monetary Board. This resolution provides a quota up
to 100% of paid-in capital and legal reserves, for a maximum of 90 days
annually, at 27% interest.
2.13      Until local conditions imply a reasonable probability of marketing
medium and long-term financial instruments, FEN will rely on short-term
instruments and, at least initially, will follow closely the design of paper
issued successfully in the recent past. FEN has been authorized to place and
maintain in circulation through end-1984 Col$7,000 million (US$88 million) in
Electricity Certificates (CEVs), representing its first financial issue.
Between April 20, 1983, the first day of the offering and end-August, the
CEVs were fully sold, 30% in 90-day and 70% in 180-day paper.  It was
marketed through the Bogota Stock Exchange and commercial banks, with
liquidity fund management provided by the Fiduciaria Bursatil, S.A., sold at
discount and in multiples of Col$100,000 (US$1,252). The average effective
return to investors at maturity is 33.48%, i.e., about 13.5 percentage points



- 18 -
above 1984 estimated inflation. As this issue has matured, FEN has been able
to replace it entirely in 180-day paper.  These favorable results may be
attributed to FEN's having chosen a proven financial instrument and having
projected a strong professional and financial image in the business and
financial community. Timing was another factor. Because of the priority
accorded to electricity investment financing, the Monetary Board had
authorized FEN to enter the market at a time when the pricing of other
available issues was relatively less competitive. Thus, estimates of FEN's
future ability to mobilize finance take account of the rather special market
conditions that prevailed during the entity's first venture (para. 2.30 and
Annex 2.6).
2.14      FEN has recently requested authorization from the National Monetary
Board to issue an additional Col$15,000 million, two-thirds in CEVs and
one-third in a two-year bond with an upward sliding return for investors who
hold it beyond a minimum period. This is directly responsive to a Monetary
Board recommendation that FEN investigate innovative mechanisms to attract
resources from the financial sector.
2.15      FEN is also studying other options for future placements.  One of
these is a medium-term bond with a floating interest rate (adjustable
quarterly by an index of the previous three-month prevailing rate),
three-year maturity, a liquidity (not support) fund, and either partial
capitalization of interest (by establishing a set interest rate at the outset
and capitalizing the rest of it) or amortization of nominal principal in
three annual installments). Another possibility is a medium-term fixed rate
bonad with provision for monetary correction, (Annex 2.1).2/
2.16      Another option, for a later stage, may be a mediumrterm bond
yielding the rate of devaluation plus some interest. This would compete with
the Transferrable Certificates of Exchange. Since the latter are issued for
six- and twelve-month terms, the new paper could differentiate itself with
maturities of about two years and a somewhat higher interest rate. However,
the tax treatment of nominal interest earned would govern the feasibility of
these bonds, as well as Variable Interest Rate Bonds (BIVs).3/ To promote
progress toward a deepening of market receptivity, it was agreed during
negotiations that, by December 31, 1984, FEN would prepare and furnish to the
Government and the Bank a plan of action acceptable to them for encouraging
medium- and long-term private investment in FEN paper.  The Government has
ag;reed that it would promptly thereafter put such plan into action.
2/ In Colombia there are papers of this type, the housing mortgage bonds
(UPACs), which receive a favorable tax treatment, annual interest earned
exempt up to 8%; from 8% to the rate of monetary correction, interest is
taxable at one-half the otherwise applicable tax rate, and only above the
latter does the full rate apply. UPACs have two drawbacks: monetary
correction has been less than inflation, and even their preferred tax
treatment does not compete strongly with short-term paper. Nevertheless,
even to issue bonds similar to the UPAC's requires legal authorization.
3/ An additional obstacle to issuing BIVs is the lack of a free index of
short-term interest rates.

2.17      Total resources that could be mobilized by FEN from local investors
are projected to grow from Col$18,500 million in 1984 to Col$62,900 million
in 1987 (paras. 3.24-3.27 and Annex 2.6), although market uncertainties
preclude disaggregating this estimate between short- and longer-term
resources. To help ensure that FEN mobilizes domestic savings at a level
consistent with its maintaining an important share in incremental financial
resources, agreement has been reached during negotiations on annual targeted
amounts of funds to be raised from local investors (Annex 2.7). These
targets would be reviewed annually by FEN, the Government and the Bank, and
updated with Bank concurrence. Also during negotiations, assurance has been
obtained from the Government that it would take all measures necessary on its
part to provide FEN with adequate access to the domestic capital market.
External Capital Market
2.18      FEN's external operations may include borrowings, bond placements,
export credits on behalf of the power utilities and other lines of credit,
subject to the normal regulations pertaining to public entities. Foreign
borrowing requires the prior approval of DNP (and CONPES, in the case of debt
guaranteed by the Republic), the Ministry of Finance and the Monetary Board,
who coordinate public sector borrowing, confirm its compatibility with
national policy and supervise the terms and conditions of borrowing. FEN
would assist in this by providing company and sector-wide financial informa-
tion relating to such proposed borrowing.
2.19      Although FEN's mandate envisages borrowings in the international
capital market on behalf of the power companies, it was planned that the
individual utilities would continue to secure all their own external capital
requirements during the early years of FEN's operations. However, present
market uncertainties vis-a-vis Latin America have cast some doubt upon the
several utilities' access to external commercial sources for the financing
needed during 1984-85.  Given the volume of ongoing and future electricity
investments and the number of utilities involved, the concept of concentrat-
ing an important part of resource mobilization in a specialized intermediary
offers advantages in terms of efficiency and economies of time and cost.
Instead of the companies having to stagger sequentially, for strategical
reasons, their forays into the capital market, FEN may go to the market on
behalf of their consolidated requriements, thereby permitting a smoother cash
flow for the companies and helping to diminish the cost of late payments to
contractors, and others. Despite its recent creation, FEN is by far the
largest financial entity in the country in terms of net worth. It has
already chalked up a notable success in the domestic market, and the Governr-
ment has not only strongly supported its establishment but is also its main
shareholder. The proposed Bank and cofinancing loans would assist in intro-
ducing FEN to the external market. At the same time, it would be inadvisable
to consider directing all lending to the sector through FEN, principally
because the primary financing and the appraisal requirements of large, com-
plex projects can be more effectively handled directly with the utility
involved.

Lending Operations
2.20       FEN's borrowers, its power company shareholders, are discussed in
Chapter 1, and their funding requirements in Chapter 5. FEN's Credit Commit-
tee, whose members are the representatives of BR, Ministry of Mines and
Energy, DNP, the President of FEN and one representative of the power sector,
considers loan applications from the power company shareholders. Upon the
Committee's favorable recommendation, the proposed loan is presented for
final approval by FEN's Board of Directors. The composition of the Credit
Committee is satisfactory because the parties involved would represent a
balanced basis for decision-making (para. 2.28). Further, a favorable
recommendation to the Board for loan approval would also require a positive
vote of the representative of either BR or DNP.
2.21       FEN has two ways of lending in the usual course of its business.
First, a local bank, with FEN's authorization, lends to a power company based
upon prior agreement with FEN that the bank will in effect borrow from FEN a
high percentage of the face loan amount to be lent to the power company. In
practice, these are rediscounted loans. Secondly, FEN may make direct loans
to individual power companies, which must be secured with local bank
guarantees. In addition, special arrangements have been worked out for
handling the proceeds of external loans (para. 2.27).
2.22       Indirect (Rediscounted) Loans.  Because FEN will conduct its lend-
ing of domestically-based resources through the local banking system, the
system's capability to handle the projected volume of lending is paramount.
In this respect, the dominant issue has been the limits to which banks may
lend to individual borrowers. Article 86(1) of Law 45 of 1923 provided that
no bank could lend to an individual borrower if his total outstanding obliga-
tions to that bank amounts to 10% of the bank's paid-in capital and reserves,
unless the borrower would provide the bank with real security valued commer-
cially at 120% of the value of the obligations guaranteed by such security,
in which case the amount of the borrower's total obligations could not exceed
25% of the bank's paid-in capital and reserves. Moreover, by Decree 3233 of
1965 it was established that, for purposes of calculating the individual
credit limits, the guarantees granted by the bank to the borrower should also
be taken into account. The 10% and 15% ceilings authorized left little room
for new lending to the major power companies, without their giving liens on
assets. In essence, this problem derived from the lopsided relationship
between a banking system in a modest stage of development and a group of
electricity companies with a comparatively large base of income-earning fixed
assets and, thus, debt service capability. In other words, the regulations
did not address the creditworthiness of the borrower and sought only to avoid
concentration of risk. In April 1983, with Bank support, the lending ceil-
ings in respect of the power sector were raised to 25% of total capital and
reserves including revaluation for unsecured loans and 40%, with a pledge of
real security. As discussed below, the new limit on unsecured lending appear
generally ample to allow sufficient local funds to reach the sector through
1987.
2.23       Assuming no reduction of levels of the power companies' indebted-
ness, the new legal limits would exceed by a wide margin, the local borrow-
ings projected by each power company during 1983-87, and would be sufficient
to accommodate the proposed A and B-loans. Annexes 2.7-2.10 show the present



- 21 -
and projected level of the domestic banking system's capital and legal
reserves over this period, and local indebtedness of the sector and of each
company. During 1983-85 approximately US$1,164 million equivalent of legal
local borrowing capability would not have been used by the six major utili-
ties (Annex 2.10), based upon the consolidated sector financial projections.
In respect of the four main companies to be included as sub-borrowers under
the proposed A and B-loans (para. 4.08), the surplus borrowing scope would
amount to an estimated US$701 million equivalent during 1983-85, which indi-
cates that the banking system would be able to accomodate legally the pro-
posed US$370 million external loans without crowding out the anticipated flow
of domestic resources to the companies. (The implications of the FEN's own
lending ceiling are discussed in para. 2.26).
2.24      Aside from the matter of legal lending limits, there is the ques-
tion of whether there would be adequate incentives for local banks to parti-
cipate in rediscounting operations. In principle, banks would be expected to
do so if their profit margins would equal or exceed alternative uses of their
funds. When FEN authorizes an indirect loan to a power company, it will
rediscount most of the loan given by a bank to a company (i.e., about 90%).
Normally in making loans, banks would be required by the Government to invest
an additional amount (16.5%) in Agricultural Fiduciary Fund (FFA) paper that
gives an annual yield of about 8%, well below the market interest rate. To
assist FEN in being able to offer attractive margins to the banks without
raising the interest rate charged to its borrowers, or increasing the dis-
counted share of the loan (which would reduce the flow of funds to the
sector), the Monetary Board has exempted FEN's rediscount operations from FFA
forced investments. With this action, the banks will be able to obtain an
attractive yield, about 36% (about 14% in real terms) on their own resources,
enabling FEN initially to charge the banks an annual rediscount rate of 27%
paid quarterly in advance and maintain a rediscount margin of about 90%, and
the power companies would be charged annual interest of 28% p.q.a. (repre-
senting an effective interest rate of 32.3%).
2.25      Direct Loans.  As mentioned above, direct loans from FEN require
bank guarantees and the present cost of such guarantees would be at least
0.5%-1.0% annually on the outstanding balance. However, in direct lending
local banks would not provide additionality of funds to the sector, and
guarantees are counted against regulated bank lending limits at 120% of the
face value of the loan.   Consequently, FEN intends to use the rediscount
mechanism as its usual lending channel.
2.26      Just as commercial bank lending is subject to ceilings, direct and
indirect FEN loans are, too. Under the original statutory limits, FEN could
authorize loans, without real security, only up to an amount equivalent to
25% of its capital and legal reserves to an individual company, and up to 50%
with such security. As shown in Annex 2.11, FEN's unsecured outstanding
lending to each power company could not have exceeded a total of Col$2,822
million through 1985, equivalent to about US$38 million during 1983-87. In
January 1984, the Government took account of the various inconsistencies in
restricting thusly FEN's lending capability. First, FEN's estimated capabil-
ity to mobilize funds during 1983-87 would far exceed its lending capability
in relation to the six major-investing power companies. Secondly, the limits
would take no account of borrowers' creditworthiness. Furthermore, in any
event, FEN would not ultimately bear the credit risk of lending locally-



- 22 -
raised to the power companies; this would always be borne by local banks.
Third, FEN's real risk would lie in its exposure to individual local commer-
cial banks, which was not then regulated. Finally, the composition of FEN's
Credit Committee, which approves loan requests, would reduce to a low proba-
bility possible undue concentration of lending in any individual company.
Prior to negotiation of the proposed project, the Government amended FEN's
statutory framework to resolve this.
2.27      Decree No. 3574 of December 30, 1983 provides that the onlending to
the power companies of loans deriving from external sources would not be sub-
ject to lending ceilings on the commercial banks or FEN; further the guaran-
tees specified in Law 11 could be obtained not only from local banks, but
also the Government. The Decree also provides that FEN's legal lending
limits in respect of local resources are to be calculated on the basis of
FEN's total capital and reserves.
Credit Policy and Regulations
2.28      Because FEN's lending activities will influence in an important way
the economic efficiency of electricity investments, it is essential that its
credit policy and regulations provide an appropriate framework. Its lending
would be project-based, within a contractual framework that (a) calls for the
power company borrowers to achieve/maintain a sound level of managerial,
operational and financial performance; (b) specifies conditions governing
procurement and disbursement to ensure that proceeds are used in an economic-
ally efficient manner and for specified purposes; (c) provides for causes of
suspension of disbursements and acceleration of loan maturity; and (d)
requires regular reporting, as well as post-project evaluation. FEN's
interest rate policy ties variable interest rate to its total cost of funds
plus a reasonable profit and provides that exchange rate risk in external
loans is borne by the ultimate borrower (para. 4.09).
2.29      The Bank has reviewed and discussed with FEN its credit policy and
manual of regulations and operational procedures. Consultant services pro-
vided under the project would, under terms of reference acceptable to the
Bank, assist FEN in improving further upon its manual of operational proce-
dures to help ensure an efficient operation. Agreement has been reached that
changes which, in the Bank's opinion, would have an adverse effect on FEN or
the proposed project, would not be introduced into the credit policy or regu-
lations.
Financial Projections
2.30      At this stage, financial projections can be made only in a highly
summarized form based upon estimates of the entity's total local resource
mobilization capability, total annual lending to the power companies, costs
of funds and operations, and the basic financial performance parameters that
would be adhered to. On this basis, FEN's financial outlook is favorable
(Annexes 2.12-2.16), its net worth is projected to grow threefold during
1982-1987, from Col$10,148 million to Col$30,595 million. Estimated sources
and uses of funds during this period are:

2.31       In view of the importance of the official funds to FEN's sources of
financing, a change in the statutory provision for them that would negatively
affect FEN's financial condition would be a condition of default under the
proposed loan. It can be observed that FEN's liquidity would need to be
monitored carefully given the entity's reliance upon term transformation and
the risk of collection delays. During negotiations, agreement was reached
that FEN will not authorize new lending to any borrower which is in default
under any existing loan granted by FEN either as a direct or rediscounted
loan (see also para. 2.28). Further, confirmation was received that FEN will
maintain at all times a liquidity buffer equivalent to not less than two
months of estimated annual expenses plus one month of the estimated amount of
principal that would become due and payable to local investors during the
year; these estimates would be agreed during the annual review discussed
below. Additionally, FEN would maintain a debt-equity ratio not to exceed
7:1, based upon all indebtedness. It was also agreed that FEN, the Govern-
ment and the Bank will review annually, beginning in March 1984, the entity's
domestic resource mobilization (para. 2.23), financial performance and pros-
pects; this will be carried out in light of the annual power sector financing
strategy review discussed in paras. 1.20 and 5.13.
4/ The only debt that amortizes during this period is the ISS Constant Value
Bonds (para. 2.10). Debt to local investors is conservatively assumed to
be short-term, continuously renewed and, consequently, is not included.

3. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Trends in the Colombian Financial Sector
3.01      Institutional Structure.  Colombia has a relatively well-developed
financial sector made up of highly specialized institutions. It comprises
the BR, about 25 each of commercial banks and corporaciones financieras
(CFs--investment banks), a central mortgage bank (Banco Central
Hipotecario--BCH), 10 savings and loan associations (Corporaciones de Ahorro
y Vivienda--CAVIs), nearly 40 trade finance companies (Companias de
Financiamiento Comercial (CFCs), more than 70 insurance companies, several
mutual funds and three stock exchanges (at Bogota, Medellin and Cali). The
commercial banks have the largest branch network, with more than 1,800
offices distributed throughout the country, followed by the CAVIs (400 branch
offices in total), BCH (75 offices) and CFs (over 100 branch offices). (Annex
3.1)
3.02      Developments Through 1972.  The Colombian financial sector was
relatively repressed through the end of 1972. Financial savings were
depressed by low ceilings on interest rates, reserve requirements were high,
and credit was to a large extent rationed. By the end of the 1960s, an
increasingly flourishing informal (non-banking) market had developed,
reflecting attempts to circumvent the regulations of the formal financial
system.
Although the process of financial liberalization did not start
until the end of 1972, a number of measures taken in the late 196Cs and early
1970s laid the foundations for such a liberalization. The establishment of a
crawling peg exchange rate system, in 1967, reduced the risk of abrupt capi-
tal flight in anticipation of major devaluations. In 1969, interest rate
ceilings were raised for term deposits with banks, BCH certificates and
publicly-held government debt. In 1971, commercial banks were allowed to
issue Certificates of Term Deposits (CDTs) at interest rates substantially
higher than those paid on savings accounts.
3.03      Creation of the Housing Financing System in 1972.  The creation of
the CAVIs in 1972 was a major innovation in the Colombian financial market,
not only because it represented a further specialization within the system,
but also because CAVIs were allowed to index both their assets and
liabilities through the use of a "constant purchasing power unit" (UPAC)
linked to the consumer price index. Both lending and borrowing rates were
subject to ceilings, but these were expressed as margins, additional to the
monetary adjustment. Thus, the UPAC system represented a further
liberalization of the financial system to the extent that higher interest
rates (that were also closer to rates determined by market forces) were one
of its consequences. However, the introduction of the UPAC system had the
specific purpose of stimulating the housing and construction sector; in the
process, indexation was introduced. Since the actual returns on UPAC savings
accounts were considerably higher than the interest rates offered by
commercial banks, the rapid growth of UPAC deposits very soon constituted a
threat to the rest of the financial system which, by 1973, had began to lose
ground.



- 25 -
3.04      The Financial Reform of 1974-75.  In August 1974 the Government
began a financial reform; the approach was to deregulate the financial
sector, restoring its capacity to attract savings and to assign credit, as
well as reducing direct intervention by the Government. The ultimate
objectives were to improve productivity and to increase the saving rate. The
reform had six principal elements: (a) ceilings on deposit interest rates
were raised substantially--those on savings and term accounts were initially
raised from 8% to 12% annually, and CDTs from 12% to 24%; (b) DFC's were
allowed to issue short-term, high interest CDTs in the hope of increasing
working capital resources for industry; (c) interest rates on most loans were
freed; (d) the banking system's reserve requirements and forced investments
were reduced; (e) attempts to control the sectoral alLocation of credit were
substantially scaled down; and (f) the development banking role of the BR
was reduced: Instead, the BR was to concentrate on its role as monetary
authority, to which end it would make greater use of spen market operations.
3.05      These movements toward easing restrictions and eliminating
distortions were, however, partly offset by other measures. First, the
expansion of the UPAC system was limited by increased reserve requirements
and a 20% ceiling on the rate of indexation (which, in fact, implied the
elimination of indexation). Second, the 1974 Tax Reform had the side effect
of decreasing the after-tax return on savings, as personal income tax became
due on interest earned by savings accounts and returns on CATs with no
allowance for inflation. At the same time, withholding at the source was
instituted for interest earnings, thus reducing the scope for tax evasion.
Realized (nominal) capital gains were subjected to taxation at the same rates
as ordinary income, less an adjustment of only 8% for inflation, thereby
reducing the attraction of the stock market. Returns on UPAC deposits were
also treated in this way, further reducing their attractiveness. Thus,
changes in both the tax and UPAC systems partially offset the positive impact
of the financial reform on savings incentives.
3.06      The 1977 Stabilization Program.  The 1977 stabilization program
reversed some of the gains achieved in easing restrictions and eliminating
distortions in the financial system, particularly by restraining the growth
of liquidity (and inflation) through the repression of the financial sector
and by a policy of fiscal stringency. The program was a reaction to the
sharp increase in the rate of inflation that followed the foreign exchange
earnings boom due to the coffee bonanza and illegal exports. In addition,
initially, a slight slowdown in the pace of devaluation relative to local
inflation probably stimulated increased private foreign borrowing. The
Government viewed the incremental foreign exchange inflows as temporary and
eschewed adopting an import liberalization program as an adjustment measure.
Instead, the Government opted to limit imports and build up international
reserves in order to absorb liquidity.
3.07      The key features of the program were:  (a) initially, a 100%
marginal reserve requirement was instituted on the increase in demand
deposits, term deposits, and foreign currency deposits over their January
1977 levels; in mid-1977, this measure was replaced by an increase (three
percentage points) in the average reserve requirements on checking accounts,



- 26 -
plus a new (16.5%) secondary reserve requirements on the portfolio (excluding
funds raised via liabilities such as CDTs); (b) imposition of quantitative
restrictions on direct foreign borrowing and a 12 percentage points rise, to
18%, in the reserve requirements on foreign currency obligations of commer-
cial banks; (c) increased reserve requirements on UPAC deposits (to 15%) and
CDTs; (d) a substantial reduction in the money base, achieved by the
reimposition of prior deposits on imports. The increase in prior deposits
hact a contractionary monetary effect; however, reduction of imports tended
to decrease aggregate supply and contributed to the inflationay process; and
(e) a one-time delay in the monetization of international reserves, forcing
exporters of coffee and services to buy exchange certificates with their
foreign exchange receipts.
3.08       The system of directed credit was strengthened with a view to
protect certain productive sectors from the otherwise general credit tighten-
ing. This was done by allowing commercial banks and issuers of certificates
of deposit to avoid additional reserve requirements to the extent that they
made investments in low interest debt (8% to 18% depending on the type) of
the! BR development funds. These Funds were then used to rediscount loans
made to the priority sectors by commercial banks, the Caja Agraria, and
DFC 's.
3.09      As a result of these measures, the money multiplier fell sharply in
1977, offsetting the large primary expansion of the money base. This reduced
pressures on prices while allowing foreign exchange reserves to increase.
The switch to a tighter fiscal policy also had a contractionary effect but
gave the private sector access to funds formerly used by the Government (a
de-crowding-out effect). On the other hand, the cut-off in foreign borrowing
put upward pressure on interest rates. Similarly, the introduction of the
exchange certificate, the increase in prior deposits on imports and forced
investments (all of which had contractionary monetary effects) tended to
raise interest rates. On balance, the rise in forced investments roughly
offset the contractionary effects of prior deposits and exchange certificates
on the money base. Thus, the net result of this part of the program was not
a stabilizing reduction in monetary growth but simply an increase in directed
credit. In effect, a two-tiered credit market was created, which increased
the cost of non-directed credit.  Those with access to directed credit were
able to borrow at negative real interest rates while those who did not have
access faced a rise in real rates and, along with depositors, subsidized
directed credit. The growth of the unregulated financial market grew rapidly
using a number of ingenious devices to avoid the new reserve requirements.
By 1979 growing sophistication in avoiding restrictions had reduced credit
from the regulated financial market from 25% to 22% of GDP. Another conse-
quence was the intensification of the group movement, as industrial conglome-
rates sought to control access to cheap credit and banks sought to control
industries which benefitted from it.
3.10      Recent Developments, 1978-82.  Since 1978 the Government has made
graLdual adjustments in its financial sector policy, in light of changing
external and domestic economic developments, generally easing restrictions.
In 1978, the 100% marginal reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits
was replaced by an increased average rate requirement. The effect of
inflation on the personal income tax liability was partially recognized--tax



- 27 -
brackets and nominal capital gains were adjusted by increasing fractions of
the inflation rate until the Tax Alleviation Law of 1979 adopted 100% adjust-
ment. In January 1980, DFC's wTere allowed to issue CDTs with a free interest
rate and a 10% reserve requirement (to be invested in the Funds); banks are
now also allowed to enter this market. The unregulated market was brought
under tighter regulation, and the use of exchange certificates was reduced.
Reserve requirements on checking accounts were lowered in January 1980 and
again in September. In September 1980, interest rate ceilings on savings
accounts and UPACs were loosened slightly. Finally, since February 1982,
additional reductions were made in reserve requirements. The net effect of
the above measures has been to increase real returns to depositors and,
ultimately, resource mobilization. In addition, the measures have improved
the competitiveness of the regulated market relative to the unregulated one.
3.11      Prospects for Further Reforms.  The Government that took office in
the second half of 1982 is preparing a new financial reform. This reform is
expected to provide a more precisely defined framework for the new types of
financial institutions and operations that have proliferated in recent
years. Also, it would increase the supervisory powers of the monetary
authorities, in order to permit a more effective monitoring of the perform-
ance of financial institutions.
Liabilities of the Financial Sector
3.12      The liabilities of the major private financial intermediaries grew
quite rapidly from 1970 to 1981. The average growth rate was 33% per year,
well above the 28% average growth rate of money GDP during the same period.
The process of fInancial deepeni g of the Colombian economy reflected both
the increase in the community's demand for financial assets that accompanied
the improvement in living standards (per capita real GDP increased at an
average rate of 3% per year), as well as the increase in real interest rates
that was caused by the move towards financial liberalization up to 1977 and
the economic stabilization measures adopted since that year.
3.13      The process of financial deepening brought about a deep change in
the composition of the liabilities of the financial sector.  (Annex 3.2)
Demand deposits lost ground steadily, from nearly 60% of the sector's liabil-
ities in 1970 to less than 30% in 1981.  Two new instruments, that at the
beginning of the decade either did not exist (UPAC deposits) or were neglig-
ible (CDTs) jointly represented over 40% of the sector's liabilities by the
end of 1981.
3.14      Rapid growth and structural change have occurred in spite of the
fact that the public has not been offered a diversified menu as far as the
term structure of maturities is concerned. The overwhelming majority of the
liabilities offered to the public is short-term (up to one year). This
feature, of course, creates problems of term transformation for financial
institutions that seek to lend long or even mediumrterm and, as a result,
there is a concentration on short-term lending.

3.15      The tax treatment of interest earnings has hampered the creation of
medium and long-term financial liabilities. Interest earnings are taxed in
full under the highly progressive personal income tax instituted in 1974,
with no allowance for inflation. In an economy like Colombia's, where the
annual inflation rate can easily fluctuate between 20% and 25% and the
nominal interest rate on deposits can be a few percentage points greater,
what might appear to be a real interest rate of, say, 5% to 8% before tax,
can become a negative real rate after tax, even for savers that face moderate
marginal income tax rates. Further, interest earnings are subject to with-
holding at the source under the personal income tax, thus identifying the
earner and reducing the scope for tax evasion. Payments of "indexation" and
margins for deposits under the UPAC system are subject to the same tax treat-
ment except for the fact that they are allowed an arbitrary deduction of 8%
for inflation.
3.16      A consequence of this state of affairs is that CDTs--formally--earn
no interest. Rather, they are sold at a discount. Under the Colombian law
the difference between the face value of the document (received by the saver
at maturity) and the discounted value (at which the document was bought by
the saver) is a capital gain. More importantly, capital gains are not sub-
ject to withholding at the source which gives scope for tax evasion.
3.17      If tax considerations determine that financial liabilities must be
sold at a discount rather than pay interest, medium-term financial liabili-
ties would be seriously handicapped in the market place. Given the Colombian
pattern of sharply fluctuating interest rates in the short-run, a medium-term
discount paper would be subject to sharp price fluctuations in the short run,
that would reduce its liquidity.  For a given change in interest rates, the
magnitude of the corresponding price change would, of course, be magnified
for longer maturities. As a result, a medium-term paper would have to be
sold at overdiscounted prices to compensate for the reduced liquidity and
increased risk to the holder. It is not surprising then that the Colombian
financial market has failed to develop any significant medium-term
instruments.
3.18       For the Colombian financial market to offer good prospects for
medium-term bonds the interest rate would have to be variable, to accommodate
the interest rate fluctuations that often occurred in the past. In addition,
basic changes in the personal income tax treatment of interest earnings would
be required. As far as the project is concerned, the Government has agreed
to take measures to encourage medium and long-term investment in FEN paper
(paras. 2.14-2.16).
Assets of the Financial Sector
3.19      Total institutional credit outstanding as of the end of 1981 stood
at Col$525 billion. Its average annual growth rate from 1970 to 1981 was
31%, somewhat lower than the rate of growth of the financial sector's liabil-
ities, but higher than the average rate of growth of money incomes.
3.20      The relative importance of the sources of institutional credit has
changed over the last decade. (Annex 3.3) The specialized lending agencies
of the Government (BCH, Caja de Credito Agrario, Industrial, Minero, and Caja
Social de Ahorros) have lost ground as the importance of directed and subsi-
dized credit has declined. The share of commercial banks also fell somewhat



- 29 -
during the last few years.  CAVIs and CFCs, none of which existed at the
beginning of the decade, now represent nearly one-third of institutional
credit. As of the end of 1981, commercial banks still accounted for 40% of
the market, CAVIs 22%, financial corporations 17%, commercial finance comr-
panies 8% and the specialized lending agencies of the Government the remain-
ing 13%.
3.21      The distribution of institutional credit by term shows an increas-
ing share of short-term credit vis-a-vis medium- and long-term credit (Annex
3.4). Short-term credit accounted for 55% of total credit outstanding at the
end of 1981, while in 1970 it had represented only 41%. During the same
period the share of mediumrterm credit decreased from 25% to 17% and that of
long-term credit from 34% to 28%. The decline of long-term credit is more
marked if housing credit is excluded: from 17% in 1970 to only 10% in 1981.
FEN's Participation in Domestic Capital Markets
3.22      Because FEN will have to obtain an important part of its financial
resources in the domestic capital markets, the following paragraphs assess
the likely evolution of those markets--in light of Colombia's expected
economic performance--and the reasonable amounts of resources that FEN may be
expected to capture competitively without causing undesirable crowding-out
effects.
Recent Evolution of Financial Savings
3.23      From 1974 to 1981, the holdings of financial assets by the
publicl/ increased dramatically. By a factor of nearly ten in nominal
terms, or by a factor of 2.2 in real terms. As a ratio to GDP they grew from
18% in 1974 to 29% in 1981. The rapid growth of holdings of financial assets
must be attributed to the process of financial liberalization, that resulted
in higher average real interest rates offered to savers in a more competitive
environment, as well as to financial innovations introduced through the
Issuance of new short-term assets such as CDTs and UPAC deposits (Annex 3.5).
1/   The definition of financial assets held by the public used in this
section does not match the liabilities of the financial sector discussed
in paras. 3.12-3.18.  It includes holdings of Government bonds as well
as bonds issued by the Coffee Growers' Association. There is an element
of double counting to the extent that, for some assets gross holdings
had to be considered when net holdings could not be estimated.

FEN's Prospects
3.24       The process of financial deepening is expected to continue in
Colombia, though at a slower pace than that observed in the 1970s. Real GDP
is assumed to recover from the 1982 slowdown, with the growth rate reaching
2.5% in 1983 and 4% in 1984, and then rising less steeply reaching 5.6% by
1986. The inflation hypothesis is for a gradual decline, from 23%-24% in
1982-83 to 20% in 1986 and thereafter.
3.25       Projected holdings of financial assets would increase from 32.1% of
GDP in 1982 to 35.1% in 1987. The projections have been prepared on the
basis of estimates of the elasticy of (real) holdings of financial assets
with respect to (real) GDP. For this purpose, financial assets were classi-
fied onto "Ml" (currency and demand deposits), and other (interest earning)
financial assets. The elasticities used were 1.26 for the former and 1.37
for the latter.

3.26       The increase in holdings of financial assets over 32.1% of GDP (the
ratio in 1982) could be considered the maximum amount of financial resoures
that could be demanded by new participants in the financial markets --such as
FEN--without crowding-out effects. On this basis, and given the projected
increases in the financial assets to GDP ratio, the maximum incremental
amounts of financial resources available would be:
Maximum Incremental Availability of Financial Resources
Year               (billion of Col$)
1983                       17.1
1984                       25.2
1985                       39.5
1986                       58.8
1987                       89.5
Source: Mission estimates.
3.27       Of course, all of these incremental resources will hardly be avail-
able to FEN, which will have to compete with other demanders of incremental
financial resources. By and large, the proportion of these funds that will
flow to FEN will depend on decisions made by the monetary authority. It is
conceivable that, initially, FEN might capture up to 50% of incremental
financial resources. But even if the initial proportion would be as high as
50%, reflecting the high priority that recent Governments haveattached to
investments in the power sector and the correspondingly high financial
requirements of ongoing projects, this proportion would in all likelihood
decline rapidly, maybe to 20%-25% (see below). If so, the financial
resources that FEN could obtain in the domestic capital markets would
increase from about Col$3-Col$8 billion in 1983 to Col$18 billion in 1987.
FEN's first experience in tapping the domestic market lends credence to the
estimates as Col$7 billion were raised by mid-1983 (para. 2.13).

4. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
4.01       Of the two main project objectives, the first is to assist Colombia
in its efforts to provide the electricity supply required to support growth
and employment. At the present time, the country needs support to sustain,
during 1984-85, the scheduled construction pace of several high priority
electricity development projects in its scaled down investment program. De-
lays, mainly attributable to unforeseen geological characteristics and
insufficient financing availabilities, have already added 1 to 2 years to
estimated completion dates of various large hydroelectric facilities.
Further significant slippage is estimated to entail heavy electricity ration-
ing, despite the aforementioned slowing of demand. Several of these projects
have Bank loans associated with a portion of their foreign exchange cost, but
substantial additional external financing is required both to complete the
original financing plans and to cover cost increases. Although it had been
expected at the time these projects were appraised that the private financing
so readily available up to 24 months ago would continue to be obtainable as
needed, and on attractive terms, market conditions and experience today have
proven otherwise. For example, in 1980 private external lenders provided 55%
of the sector's foreign capital requirements and, although it had been anti-
cipated that this share would continue its upward trend and average about 75%
during 1981-90, this has not materialized. Therefore, the project also seeks
to re-enlist the support of foreign commercial lenders to the power sector,
through a US$170 million Bank A-loan together with a US$200 million B-loan
cofinancing package.
4.02       The second objective is to support the development of FEN.  As
Borrower for the Bank and B-loans, these would be the first external loans to
FEN. Since they would partially finance a time-slice of an investment prog-
ram, this operation represents a first sector lending project for power in
Colombia. It provides an opportunity to help ensure that, from an early
stage of FEN's operational life, the institution would have the capability to
be an effective channel for such lending and would foster reciprocal capabi-
lity in the power utilities. Ongoing efforts to strengthen the financial
management of the sector, as reflected in existing loan and other agreements,
would be buttressed further by the direct support to FEN to monitor the uti-
lities' financial performance and prospects, and act as power financing stra-
tegy advisor to the Government and the sector. Additionally, the loan would
further enhance FEN's image in the domestic capital market and, thus, help
facilitate its access to future savings.
1983-87 Investment Program
4.03       The 1983-87 power investment program  (para. 1.20) including all on-
going and future works, has been estimated at about Col$733 billion in
current prices (US$7.7 billion). Some 68% of these investments are for gene-
ration. Ongoing works represent about Col$293.0 billion (US$3.2 billion) in
current prices, based upon reasonable cost estimates. The construction
investment program is detailed for each of the FEN Shareholders in Annexes
5.3, 5.9, 5.15, 5.21, 5.27, 5.31 and 5.38, and is summarized below, excluding
interest during construction, working capital increases, and investments
outside of the sector:

4.05       In addition to generation facilities, ongoing transmission, sub-

program of ISA, EEEB, EPM and CVC during 1984 and 1985 are summarized below
in current values. It had been anticipated that only these financially-sound
utilities that are carrying out the bulk of the investments would participate
in the project (para. 5.13). However, at the request of FEN and the
Ministries of Finance and Mines and Energy, it has been decided to include
CORELCA and ICEL provided that they would meet certain conditions, including
the preparation of Government-endorsed investment and financing plans before
becoming eligible to borrow external loan proceeds under the project (paras.
4.12 and 5.13).

The Project
4.07       The project consists of the 1984-1985 program of priority electri-
city development investments of ISA, EEEB, EPM and CVC (para. 4.06), with
contingent inclusion of ICEL and CORELCA, as well as a program to assist FEN
in strengthening its technical capability (para. 2.05). The time-slice is
subdivided into subprojects corresponding to that portion of electricity
development projects that would be underway during the period even though
completion of the works may extend beyond it. All subprojects under the pro-
ject are to be: (a) part of the National Power Expansion Program, in the
case of generation and transmission; (b) the least-cost solution for complet-
ing the network path to the final consumer, in the case of subtransmission
and distribution; or (c) additions to general plant needed to complement (a)
and (b) above. Additionally, for subprojects to be financed with the pro-
posed loan or the Bank's share of the cofinancing loans: (a) project costs
originally expected to be financed by commercial lenders would be eligible
but project cost overruns would not be, except for the Mesitas Hydro Power
Project (Annex 4.1); (b) interest during construction on existing Bank loans
would be eligible for financing in the cases of ISA, EEEB and EPM, all of



- 35 -
which companies have under construction during 1984-85 additions to fixed
assets, partly supported by Bank loans, that are large relative to the
capital assets already employed by these companies; and (c) retroactive
financing from January 1, 1983, would not exceed US$29 million equivalent of
the total of the proposed loan and the Bank's proposed share (US$30 million)
of the B-loans (representing 15% of total Bank lending for the project). On
this basis together with the procurement norms described in the subprojects
eligible for financing under the proposed loan, and the Bank's share of the
cofinancing loans would include San Carlos I and II, Playas, Guadalupe IV,
and Guavio, as well as the Bogota Distribution Project. Subprojects eligible
for financing by commercial banks under the B-loans would include Chivor II
Emergency Works, Tunjita and Rucio River Diversions, Jaguas, Salvajina
(partly financed by IDB), Termozipa V, Termocerrejon I and II, Betania,
Termotasajero, and other smaller installations, transmission lines and sub-
stations, subtransmission, urban and rural distribution, and load dispatch
centers. Sub-loans from FEN to the utilities under the project would finance
foreign costs.   A list of priority subprojects that could be included in the
"A" and "B" loans is given in Annex 4.1.

The proposed Bank and co-financing loans would focus on the foreign costs of
on-going works, studies and interest during construction on Bank-financed
projects, and include technical assistance by consultants to FEN in the areas
of project appraisal, evaluation and monitoring of project progress. Dis-
bursements (para. 4.11) of the "A" and "B" loans are estimated as follows:

Subloans and Onlending Terms
4.09      Sub-loans financed under the proposed loan would require prior Bank
approval, except that sub-loans up to a total of US$4 million for a given
subproject would be free-limit sub-loans (other than the first three such
loans). Bank approval of free-limit sub-loans would, however, be required
prior to authorizing corresponding disbursements from the loan account. Each
sub-loan will be based upon detailed applications conforming to the afore-
mentioned criteria. FEN would approve applications for sub-loans under the
cofinancing B-loans only if the utility submitting the application would be
eligible to borrow under the proposed Bank loan; in particular, the utility
in question would need to remain current in payments to FEN under all loans
from the entity, and ICEL and CORELCA would need to fulfill certain condi-
tions precedent to their participation in any of the external financing to be
provided under the project (para. 4.12). Onlending terms of sub-loans will
be calculated upon the basis of full cost recovery by FEN on the Bank and
B-loans, and the foreign exchange risk will be borne by the utilities. Sub-
loans financed with the proceeds of the Bank and B-loans will be denominated
in dollars equivalent to the various currencies in which the principal of the
loans would be payable, and repayable in the peso equivalent of these various
currencies. Interest rate, fees and terms of the sub-loans are proposed to
be a blend of the terms of the Bank and cofinancing loans, plus a 0.5% spread
over the interest rate; maximum sub-loan term would be 15 years, including a
4-year grace period. The large volume of in-progress and future electricity
investments calls for the long-term maturities proposed. FEN will enter into
satisfactory sub-loan agreements with each sub-borrower.



- 37 -
Procurement and Disbursement Under the Bank Loan
4.10      Most contracts to be financed would have been let in advance of
Board presentation. As stated above in para. 4.06, retroactive financing,
from January 1, 1983, would be limited to US$29 million of the aggregate Bank
loan and its financial share of the cofinancing loan. Sub-loan proceeds will
be disbursed against contracts for goods and civil works which have been, or
are to be procured through international competitive bidding, in accordance
with Bank guidelines. The Bank's proposed share of the B-loans would be sub-
ject to the same procurement criteria as the Bank loan, and the commercial
lenders' share would follow procurement norms of the Bank, IDB, KfW or other
institutional lenders in the case of subprojects partly financed by the
entities, and local procedures of the Government--which are satisfactory to
the Bank--in the remaining cases.  The approximately 18 man-months of
consultant services to be engaged by FEN will be obtained according to Bank
guidelines; 100% of foreign expenditures, and 50% o-_ local, would be
financed.
4.11      Loan proceeds would be disbursed into a dollar-denominated revol-
ving fund in BR to be established by FEN, solely for the purposes of the pro-
ject. The Bank would make an initial deposit into the fund of US$50 million,
equivalent to estimated sub-loan disbursements during the first 90-day period
after loan effectiveness. Disbursements from the special account would be
made for eligible expenditures under each approved sub-loan. Special account
replenishment of the dollar equivalent amount of disbursements from that
account would be made upon receipt of withdrawal applications from FEN,
except that after disbursement of a total US$100 million, the Bank would
begin to recuperate the initial deposit. These applications would be under a
certified statement of expenditures by the sub-borrower concerned. Documen-
tation for these expenditures would be retained by FEN and available for
review by the Bank at all times. Disbursements are estimated at US$100
million in 1984 and US$70 million in 1985. In addition to annual external
auditing of FEN, the revolving fund account will be audited annually by
independent, external auditors acceptable to the Bank. The Closing Date of
the loan would be December 31, 1986.
Loan Structure
4.12      In addition to a draft Loan Agreement with FEN and a draft Guaran-
tee Agreement with the Republic, the loan documentation includes a draft
Power Financing Agreement between FEN and ISA, EEEB, EPM, CVC, CORELCA and
ICEL which establishes the general subloan terms and conditions. Further, in
this draft Agreement, the utilities reconfirm the relevant financial per-
formance covenants of the Guavio loan in respect of rate of return on annual-
ly revalued assets and internal cash generation. The Agreement also provides
for a capital expenditure limitation, and debt service coverage.  In the case
of IGEL, for which it has not been possible to establish financial targets or
even a reasonable financial forecast, and in the case of CORELCA, they would
be eligible to receive proceeds from the proposed Bank and cofinancing
B-loans only after preparation by November 30, 1984, of Government-endorsed
investment and financing programs, satisfactory to the Bank. For each com-
pany, these programs should cover the years 1984-87, including the additional



- 38 -
years in which the proposed La Miel (ICEL) and Urra (CORELCA) power genera-
tion projects would be carried out. The programs would be accompanied by a
Government commitment to take all actions necessary, including timely provi-
sion of funds, to enable ICEL and CORELCA to carry out the programs, as well
as to service any sub-loans which they may receive from the proposed external
loans. In the event that plans satisfactory to the Government and the Bank
would not materialize by the date mentioned above, the company involved would
become ineligible to borrow under the loans, and the approximately US$40
million of total Bank and cofinancing loan proceeds that would be held in
abeyance for them until that time would be committed to priority ongoing pro-
jects of other companies. However, the sector financial analysis (Chapter 5)
assumes that total external loan proceeds would be allocated to only the four
major companies. In addition, the Government would: (a) by December 31,
1984, establish in ICEL adequately staffed Financial and Operations Depart-
ments; and (b) cause ICEL to carry out, by December 31, 1984 a study to
determine the value of its assets. Additionally, ISA would participate in
the annual review of the power sector's investment program and financing
strategy, in a financial study to be carried out by FEN, and in the design of
an appropriate construction price index for the sector. Any failure by the
parties to the Power Financing Agreement would constitute an event of suspen-
sion under the Loan Agreement.
Benefits and Risks
4.13      The proposed project will assist Colombia to maintain construction
rhythm of ongoing electricity development projects which will supply the
electric energy needed to facilitate growth of those industrial and commer-
cial activities which currently use it, as well as help supply electricity to
a larger segment of the country's population, only 54% of which now have
access to it. The participation of the international capital market is being
enlisted in this endeavor. The support provided for the development of FEN
is expected to enhance power sector financial management, in addition to the
buttressing the entity's ability to mobilize substantial investment financing
needed by the power utilities.
4.14      A return on investment for the project has not been quantified.
IHowever, it has been established that the projects which are prospective sub-
loan candidates for Bank financing would have higher internal rates of return
than the 13%-15% estimated at the time of original Bank appraisal. Tariffs
(the proxy for benefits) have increased more rapidly than projected, while
average costs are approximately the same. Further, for all hydroelectric
facilities included under the project, representing about 80% of project
costs, the average cost remains a low US$700 per kW installed. Subtrans-
mission and distribution facilities would represent the least-cost means of
bringing electricity service to the final consumer. There is a risk that the
local currency share of investments may not be available in a timely manner.
However, the expected internal cash generation of the four major utilities,
the measures already taken by the Colombian authorities to mobilize savings,
as well as future actions that have been agreed should enable project financ-
ing to materialize as scheduled.  There is another risk, which is attendant
mainly upon FEN's ability to fulfill its role as a development banking insti-
tution. By virtue of its financial significance, there may be pressures
brought to bear upon its decisions. However, the establishment of sound
lending operating criteria, the support provided for its monitoring and



- 39 -
advisory role and the broad-based composition of its Board and Credit
Committee--as spelled out in the entity's Bylaws--together with the
agreements reached with the Government and the power utilities on the condi-
tions under which new projects would be initiated, should help minimize this
risk.
5. POWER SECTOR FINANCES
Introduction
5.01      This section deals with the financial performance and outlook of
the main electric companies which are shareholders of FEN. As pointed out in
Chapter 4, ISA, EEEB, EPM and CVC will be the beneficiaries of the proposed A
and B loans; CORELCA and ICEL will be eligible for subloans provided that key
conditions will be met beforehand (para. 5.13).  Set out below is the present
and projected financial situation of each utility, followed by a consolidated
analysis of the sector.  This has been done under the coordination of ISA
with Bank assistance and is based on an agreed methodology and assumptions.
The 1983-87 projections are based on the National Power Expansion Program
adopted in 1983 (para. 1.20).
5.02      ISA generates, operates the interconnected system and sells in
bulk to its five shareholders, who are connected to the national grid and
also generate power in their own plants as well as take power from the grid.
ISA's shareholders contribute capital for the financing of all major projects
connected to the grid, which are constructed either by ISA or by its share-
holders with ISA participation in the investment; thus the finances of the
individual companies cannot be fully analyzed in isolation. There are sub-
stantial fund flows between the companies and financial problems in one com-
pany may affect others. This creates the need for continuous and systematic
monitoring of an individual company and sectoral financial performance as
well as careful attention to tariff policy at the national level (para.
5.14).
5.03      ISA
(a)  1977-82 Financial Performance has been satisfactory based mainly on
balanced operating results and the equity contributed by its share-
holders. Rates of return were in the range of those covenanted
with Bank as well as other financial indicators forecast in the San
Carlos and Guavio loans (Annexes 5.1 and 5.2). Since 1980 increa-
sing arrears from shareholders (mainly ICEL, EEEB and ultimately
CVC) in energy bills and capital contributions have adversely
affected ISA's ability to make timely payments to contractors,
causing delays in projects under construction.
(b)  Investment and Financing Plan:  ISA's 1984-85 and 1984-87
investment program and financing plan is summarized below and shown
in detail in Annex 5.5.

(c)  Outlook:  ISA's financial projections (Annexes 5.1.4 to 5.1.6) seem to
be acceptable. In principle, financial equilibrium should be easy for
ISA to maintain. It has a captive market with only 5 large wholesale
customers (its shareholders), long-term sale contracts and good
mechanisms for increasing tariffs when needed based on agreed financial
targets. In addition, ISA has firm commitments from its shareholders
(based on its by-laws) and the Government for capital contributions to
finance the local costs of its construction program and debt service.
Finally, ISA's present financial situation is strong, having external
loans from the Bank, IDB, suppliers and commercial banks, which cover
the foreign currency requirements for much of its ongoing construction
program; the remaining balance needed for 1984-85 is to be funded by the
proposed A and B loans.   Consequently, ISA's main financial risk is the
ability of its shareholders or the Government to fulfill their financial
commitments to it.

5.04       EEEB
(a)  Financial Performance: Over its 23-year relationship with the Bank
EEEB has maintained a sound financial position, with a slightly
declining trend since 1979.  Internal cash generation provided
about 50% of its investments on average, including its contribu-
tions to ISA. EEEB enjoys a high-density market and the area's
geographical advantages for hydro generation. The balance of the
company's investment funds has been obtained through borrowings; no
Government funding or other capital contributions have been
involved. Between 1979 and 1981, rate of return and self-financing
ratios were slightly below those covenanted in Bank loans (Annexes
5.7 and 5.8); however, debt/equity ratio and debt service coverage
remained at comfortable levels. Nevertheless, EEEB's arrears in
payments to ISA and to its own contractors increased sharply and
with consequent delays in construction projects (Mesitas, Bogota
Distribution and Guavio). This resulted from (i) tariff increases,
even through reasonable in nominal terms, were eroded by a higher
than expected rate of increase in operating costs (para. 5.15);
(ii) electricity rationing: lower than projected energy sales and
relatively higher energy purchases from ISA which is more costly
than EEEB's own generation; (iii) a heavy investment program:
existing total fixed assets have doubled in real terms in the
3-year period 1980-82; (iv) insufficient local financing and (v)
absence of compensating capital contributions from Government or
other sources.
(b)  Investment and Financing Plan:  EEEB's 1984-85 and 1984-87 invest-
ment program and financing plan is summarized below and shown in
detail in Annex 5.9.

(c)  Outlook:  Notwithstanding the trend described in (a) above, EEEB's
financial outlook appears adequate provided the basic projection
assumptions regarding tariff levels and sufficient financing are
met. Tariffs are projected to increase at a faster rate than
operating costs (Annexes 5.10 to 5.12).  This comprises the present
tariff increase program already authorized by JNT (Resolution No.
05/82) and comprises a one-time, flat 21% increase enacted in
October 1982 and, from November 1982 to December 1984, a monthly
increase averaging 3.25%l/; for 1985 and thereafter a 20% annual
increase was assumed.  This is estimated to meet the rate of return
and self-financing targets agreed with the Bank. The remaining
financing needed for ongoing investments during 1984-85 would be
provided under the project.
5.05      EPM
(a)  Financial Performance:  EPM's Power Department (as well as the
Telephone, Water and Sewerage Department) has had a history of
adequate operating results and satisfactory overall financial per-
formance (Annexes 5.13 and 5.14). Self-financing, averaging 60%
for the 1977-82 period, has adequately complemented its investments
requirements including recent contributions to ISA; this may be
attributed in large part to the high density of its market and very
low-cost facilities, given the area's geographic advantages for
hydro generation. The balance for the company's investment
requirements has been obtained through borrowings. No Government
funding or capital contributions have been involved.
(b)  Investment and Financing Plan:  EPM's 1984-85 and 1984-87
investment program and financing plan is summarized below and shown
in detail in Annex 5.15.
1/ The monthly tariff increase was suspended for 60 days due to a
Presidential decision in late 1982 and ultimately, reduced to 2.3%
in line with adjusted inflation assumptions for 1984.

(c)  Outlook:  It shows a viable picture provided the achievement of
forecast assumptions and targets, especially the balance between
tariffs and operating costs and availability of domestic financing
(Annexes 5.16 to 5.18). EPM's present financial situation is
sound; the company is the strongest of ISA's shareholders. The
present tariff increase program approved by EPM's Board and author-
ized by JNT is comprised of a monthly increase of 2.2% with no
terminal date specified for such monthly increase. Financial
forecast is based on (a) continuation of the 2.2% monthly increase
through 1984; (b) a 15% punctual increase in June 1984; and
(c) 1.8% monthly increase during 1985-1987. It is expected that
this program of tariff increases, which is in line with current
Government policy, will be accepted by JNT before the presentation
to the Board of the proposed loan for EPM's Rio Grande Project,
currently scheduled for July 1984. Proceeds of the Bank and
cofinancing loans will complete the financing requirements for the
1984-85 program of ongoing construction.

5.06      CVC
(a)  Financial Performance:  Since 1977 CVC has had an acceptable
financial performance, however, some difficulties have recently
arisen. Its financial performance has been characterized by two
main factors: (a) tariff increases that slightly surpassed the
cost of service; and (b) a relatively modest investment program, of
which 50% has been contributions to ISA. Rates of return were in
the range covenanted in the San Carlos Shareholders Agreement, and
self-financing averaged 68% in 1978-82 period; capital contribur-
tions by consumers - rural electrification - were about 2% and the
remaining balance was funded by borrowings (Annexes 5.19 and
5.20). Starting in late 1981, insufficient financing relative to
the requirements of its on-going contruction program (mainly the
Salvajina hydro project) has strained CVC's financial situation
resulting in significant arrears to ISA. Since 1977 no Government
funding or capital contributions have been involved.
(b) Investment and Financing Plan: CVC's 1984-85 and 1984-87 invest-
ment program and financing plan is summarized below and shown in
detail in Annex 5.21.

(c)  Outlook:  Despite the developments described in (a) above the pre-
sent financial position and forecast of CVC appear to be adequate
(Annexes 5.22 to 5.24), although highly tied to the availability of
timely financing and to a sustained tariff increase aimed at pro-
viding the required self-financing. The present tariff increase
program authorized by JNT on which the financial forecast was
based, comprises a 2.2% monthly increase for 1984 and 1985. Annual
increases equivalent to expected inflation have been assumed for
1985 and thereafter. Proposed financing from the proceeds of the
Bank and cofinancing loans will fund the unfinanced balance of
ongoing construction, except for a small balance of US$5 million
that is to be covered by planned Government borrowings in 1985.
5.07      CORELCA Group
The CORELCA Group consist of a holding company CORELCA, which is
responsible for power generation and transmission, and eight distributing
subsidiary companies ("electrificadoras"), which mainly purchase power in
bulk from CORELCA for retail sales in the eight departments of the Atlantic
Region; the electrificadoras generate only minor amounts of energy. The
historic financial analysis referred to below is based on CORELCA's perform-
ance because historic statements of the consolidated group are not complete;
however, the financial outlook for the 1983-85 period is based on the conso-
lidated statements of CORELCA and its eight electrificadoras.
(a)  Financial Performance:  CORELCA's 1977-82 financial performance has
been poor, with a deteriorating trend. Rates of return ranged
below the targets of the San Carlos II and Village Electrification
Loans as well as the other financial indicators (Annexes 5.25 and
5.26). The main reasons for this picture are: (i) lower sales
growth than expected; (ii) low revenues level in comparison with
its operating costs (operating ratio averages 80% in 1980-82);
(iii) heavy debt service resulting in a coverage averaging 0.7 for
1980-82; and (iv) high accounts receivable for the energy sold
mainly from Government and municipal agencies.
(b)  Investment and Financing Plan:  CORELCA's 1984-1985 and 1984-87
investment program and financing plan is summarized below and shown
in detail in Annex 5.27.

(c)  Outlook:  The outlook of the CORELCA Group is uncertain, mainly
because of the lack of a financing plan for the local component of
the Urra hydro power and Termocartagena projects (Annexes 5.28 to
5.29). The construction of Urra has been allocated to CORELCA by
ISA, with CORELCA having a financial participation of 44% of local
costs. Assuming that the foreign component of the Urra and
Termocartagena projects (the latter has not been authorized by
CONPES) are financed by external loans, the local financing
envisaged by CORELCA (ISA's share of local costs of Urra and
CORELCA's net internal generation of funds)is not sufficient to
fund the local investment requirements of the project, resulting in
significant deficits in the 1984-87 period (Annex 5.29); the
financing of such gaps, would exceed the borrowing capability of
CORELCA. The Government together with ISA and CORELCA are
currentiy studying alternative investment and financing options,
which will bear directly upon CORELCA's eligibility to borrow under
the proposed Bank and cofinancing loans (para. 5.13).
5.08       ICEL Group
(a)  Financial Performance:  The ICEL Group (a holding company and its
13 departmental subsidiaries) has a history of poor financial per-
formance in terms of banking standards because of the characteris-
tics of its market and the influence of political considerations in
its administration. Adequate and reliable financial statements of
the ICEL Group for the period 1977-82 are not available. However,
some basic financial indicators for the 1979-82 period reflect the
precariousness of its finances: averages of operating revenues and
operating costs (computing non-revalued depreciation) per kWh sold
virtually equivalent; debt service coverage less than one; and net
internal cash generation consistently negative. Debt service and
construction programs have been partially funded with contributions
from Government, which also provides ICEL's capital contributions
to ISA, although usually with substantial delay. ICEL has a
geographically dispersed market (about 75% of the Colombian terri-
tory comprising approximately 56% of its population), that is pre-
dominantly rural, including low and middlelow income segments of
population with few large cities or significant industrial areas.



- 47 -
These features result in high operating costs.   Furthermore, the
Group has not been efficiently managed: (a) the boards and manage-
ment of subsidiaries tend to be highly politicized; (b) there is
often strong opposition to tariff increases at the local level; (c)
investments may be undertaken without consideration of economic
feasibility; and (d) there is resistance to redistribution of
markets and regrouping subsidiaries. The Government had realized
that the ICEL Group needs be restructured to become financially
viable and operationally efficient; consequently, in November 1980
CONPES, based upon recommendations of DNP, approved a number of
measures aimed at attaining those efficiency targets. Sub-
sequently, during the Guavio loan negotiations, the Government
agreed to prepare a program for implementing DNP's recommendation
regarding the structure and operations of ICEL, to be put into
effect starting June 30, 1983. Although some measures have been
taken the reorganization will necessarily be achieved only
gradually, over a period of years.

(c)  Outlook:  The outlook of the ICEL Group is unpredictable based upon
the financial picture described above and the lack of a financing
plan for its large investment program in which the La Miel hydro
project is the main component (Annexes 5.32 and 5.33). Operating
results and internal cash generation forecast for the 1982-87
period are negative. The construction of La Miel (granted to ICEL
and CHEC - a subsidiary - by ISA) as well as other projects of the
investment program would require financing exceeding the borrowing
capability of ICEL. At present, the Government has under study
alternative investment and financing schemes for ICEL which,
together with other measures, will determine ICEL's eligibility as
a subborrower under the Bank and cofinancing loans (paras. 4.12 and
5.13)
5.09       Betania
(a)   Background:  Betania is a new autonomous company, a subsidiary of
ICEL, which has been been created for the construction and
operation of the Betania hydro plant (para. 1.18) which is
currently forecast to be commissioned in 1987.
(b)   Investment and Financing Plan:  Betania's 1984-1987 investment
program and financing plan is summarized below and shown in detail
in Annex 5.35.

(c)   Outlook:  The construction of the project is well advanced and the
company has strong support of the Government; therefore, no major
problems are expected in arranging the financing needed for
completion in 1987. Betania will sell in bulk to the
interconnected system (Annex 5.34).

Financial Outlook of the Sector
5.10       The financial picture of the sector resulting from the consolidated
financial projections of the six utilities analyzed above is detailed in
Annexes 5.36 and 5.37.
5.11       Investment and Financing Plan.  The power sector's 1984-87 invest-
ment program, including construction, interest during construction, out of
the sector investments and requirements for working capital amounts to
MCol$771,400 (MUS$7,619), of which 31% corresponds to ongoing works and 47%
to future works, The sector's net internal cash generation would finance
MCol$143,000 (MUS$1,421) or 19% of the total; capital contributions from the
national budget and consumers for various distribution programs woald fund
10%; borrowings 61%, of which 12 percentage points corresponds to existing
loans, 4 percentage points to the proposed IBRD-FEN loan and 45 percentage
points to future loans.  The remaining MCol$79,500 (MtS$785), or 10%, is the
estimated financing gap(forecast by CORELCA and ICEL), which funding is
presently under consideration by the Government. The investment program and
financing plan is summarized below.

- 50 -
5.12      The scenario above shows an overall imbalance resulting from the
unwieldy deficits forecast by CORELCA and ICEL, in contrast with an adequate
picture of the four remaining companies, which may be affected if the
responsibility for construction of the Urra and La Miel projects is changed.
Existing agreements with the companies concerned provide that they would not
incur capital expenditures to increase their individual generating capacity
in excess of 100 MW unless the proposed investment is economically justified
as part of the Least-Cost National Power Expansion Program and that there
would be financing available which would not affect negatively the respective
company's existing financial obligations. This principle has been
re-confirmed during negotiations of the proposed A-loan: the Government has
undertaken to authorize the initiation of new electricity development
projects only in the event that such projects are economically justified and
that the respective power company disposes adequate financing (paras. 1.26
and! 4.12). Furthermore, each of the power companies has agreed not to commit
itself to any capital expenditure until the on-going works have been
completed, unless the proposed expenditure: (a) is economically justified;
and (b) does not exceed in the aggregate the equivalent of one percent (1%)
of the current net value of its current assets in operation. However, the
power companies may incur in such expenditures in excess of such one percent
(1%) if they have obtained financing which will not adversely affect their
financial performance.
5.13      Despite the uncertainties involved in the financial outlook for the
sector described above, it would be counterproductive to delay this proposed
operation until they are resolved. One of the strong features of ISA, EEEB,
EPM and CVC is their low debt/equity ratios (Annexes 5.2, 5.8, 5.14 and
5.20). Therefore, if they meet their performance targets - sales, tariffs
and operating expenses - they would be able to increase their indebtedness to
the levels in their forecasts without jeopardizing their financial
situations. ICEL and CORELCA, because of the precariousness of their
finances, are not yet sound credit risks; their access to loan proceeds will
be contingent upon the actions and agreements cited in para. 4.12.
5.14      The picture resulting from the financial consolidation points to
the need for periodic work on defining and updating the financing strategy
for the electric sector. During negotiations of the proposed loan, agreement
was reached that an annual review of such strategy will take place with the
Government, FEN and ISA, with the first one to be held in September 1984 (see
1.20 and below). Even though a more favorable scenario has resulted from the
recent revision of the Expansion Program by postponements of ongoing
projects, and by possible changes in the ownership/participation arrangements
for future projects, a gap to be financed remains irrespective of the new
scenario. Taking into consideration the magnitude of the investment programs
(the present or any likely alternative) and DNP's estimate of the capital
contributions from the Government, the area of tariffs and revenue efficiency
needs further analysis.  Financing mechanisms such as funds or surcharges to
transfer capital to, or within, the electric sector do not seem to be
feasible in Colombia because of regional considerations and because each
utility's investment program would have a balance to be financed. To depend
excessively on borrowings would jeopardize the financial health of the sector
in the medium term. All of these factors need to be analyzed regularly in
the light of planned capital outlays. FEN has decided to carry out a study



- 51 -
on sector finances and formulate a proposed financing strategy based upon the
approved 1987-92 Expansion Program, which will form the basis for the first
annual review. This proposal would define a balanced mix of the different
sources of financing (internal cash generation and its linkage with the
tariff policy, capitalization from the national budget or other sources, and
local and external borrowings policies) for the Expansion Program, aimed at
promoting a feasible medium-term plan. During loan negotiations, agreement
was reached that FEN will complete the study by September 15, 1984 and it
will be discussed with the Government, ISA and the Bank. ISA will
coordinate with FEN in the preparation of the study and, together with its
shareholders, give all necessary assistance to FEN. This exercise will be
repeated annually by FEN.
5.15      Evidence, suggests that the Colombian consumer price index, which
is used for asset revaluation and costing purposes, underestimates power
sector costs. Since 1977, Bank loans to the power sector have provided for
annual asset revaluation based upon changes in the consumer price index (blue
collar) as a proxy for the replacement value of assets in operation and con-
struction. This index has also been used to project operating and local
investment costs. However, ISA has demonstrated that an index based on the
construction of civil works of the San Carlos hydro project, in the period
1977-82, is 7% per annum higher than the consumer price index, and 32% accu-
mulated for the period. Use of an unsuitable index has significant negative
effects on the financial administration of the companies because: (a)
investment requirements as well as the projected cost of service is
underestimated; (b) financial indicators are misleading, e.g., rates of
return are overstated. During negotiations agreement was reached that the
Government will prepare appropriate price indexes for use by the electric
utilities. The Government, through its statistical agency, DANE, with
assistance from ISA would design such an index, and by December 31, 1984,
present it to the Bank for review and comment. An agreed index will be
computed and published quarterly, starting in January 1985.

6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01    During negotiations of the proposed loan, agreement has been reached:
(a)  that the Government would authorize capital outlays for new electri-
city projects only if the project in question would be economically
justified and there would be available adequate financing that would
not affect negatively the existing financial obligations of the
company(-ies) concerned (para. 1.26);
(b)  that any change in FEN statutory framework, credit policy and
regulations, or access to short-term borrowing from BR that, in the
Bank's opinion would have an adverse effect, would constitute events
of default under the proposed loan (paras. 2.03, 2.29 and 2.31);
(c)  that by June 30, 1984, FEN will engage consultants to complement its
technical capability in the areas of project analysis and monitoring
(para. 2.05);
(d)  that FEN will engage the services of independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank and maintain internal accounting and auditing systems in
accordance with sound principles (para. 2.06);
(e)  that FEN will annually capitalize its profits (para. 2.07);
(f)  that, by December 31, 1984, FEN would prepare a plan of action
acceptable to the Government and the Bank to encourage private
investment in medium and long-term instruments of FEN and, promptly
thereafter, the Government would put such plan into effect (para.
2.16);
(g)  on annual targets for mobilization of domestic financial savings by
FEN, which targets would be reviewed and updated, as necessary, by
agreement among FE-N, the Government and the Bank (para. 2.17);
(h)  with the Government, that all necessary measures on its part would be
taken to provide FEiJ with adequate access to the domestic capital
market (para. 2.17);
(i)  that FEN will manage its finances in such a manner as to meet the
following annual targets: FEN will maintain at all times a liquidity
buffer equivalent to not less than two months of the total of: esti-
mated expenditures plus half of the principal amount that would
become due and payable to local investors during the year; these
estimates would be agreed during the annual review discussed below.
Additionally, FEN would maintain a debt-equity ratio not to exceed
7:1. Agreement was also reached that FEN, the Government and the
Bank will review annually, beginning in March 1984, the entity's
financial performance and prospects. Further, FEN will not authorize
new lending to any borrower which is in default under any loan
previously authorized by FEN (para. 2.31);



- 53 -
(j)  on the criteria for sub-project selection, financing, procurement and
disbursement procedures (paras. 4.08-4.11);
(k)  that FEN's revolving fund accounts in BR will be audited annually by
independent, external auditors acceptable to the Bank (para. 4.11);
(1)  that ISA, EEEB, EPM, CVC and CORELCA accept the general onlending
terms and conditions. Confirmation of the financial performance
agreements reached under the most recent power loan has been obtained
from each utility, including rates of return on annually revalued
assets, internal cash generation. Agreement has also been reached on
capital expenditure limitations and debt-service ratio. Further, the
Government will ensure that adequately staffed Financial and
Operations Departments are established in ICEL. A study will be
carried out to determine the value of ICEL's fixed assets. Addition-
ally, ISA will participate in annual Power Expansion Program and
financial strategy reviews, the sector financial study to be carried
out by FEN and in the design of an appropriate price index for the
sector. These assurances would be covenanted in a Power Financing
Agreement between FEN and the power companies; a default by any of
the parties to this Agreement would constitute an event of default
under the Loan Agreement. Conditions governing ICEL and CORELCA's
eligibility to sub-loans have also been agreed (para. 4.12);
(m)  on the proposed revolving fund and on the related documentation pro-
cedures (para. 4.15);
(n)  that the Government, FEN and ISA, together with the Bank, would
review annually the financing strategy for the power sector. The
first such review would take place in September 1984, based upon a
study of sector finances to be carried out by FEN. (paras. 5.13 and
6.01(j)). This study would take account of updated electricity
demand growth projections and the associated Expansion Program, which
would be prepared by ISA and reviewed by the Government by April 30
of each year, beginning in 1984 (para. 1.20); and
(o)  that the Government, with the participation of ISA, would prepare an
appropriate price index for the electricity sector and, by December
31, 1984, present it to the Bank for review and comment. An agreed
index would be computed and published quarterly by the Government,
starting in January 1985 (para. 5.14).
6.02    The assignment of a short-term borrowing quota to FEN by the BR would
be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan (para. 2.12). Prior to
the first sub-loan, FEN will present a satisfactory sub-loan agreement to the
Bank (para. 4.09).
6.03    Based upon the agreements outlined above, the proposed project would
constitute a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$170 million with a term of
17 years including 4 years of grace.

FEN POWER DEVELOPMENT FINANCE
Mediumr and Long-Term Financing in Countries with High Inflation
1.        Excluding public and external sources, the essential problem which
the FEN faces is that of providing medium-and long-term credit to the
electric sector, with funds raised in a market that is almost exlusively
short-term. This is also the case with the other Colombian development
finance institutions (corporaciones financieras). In fact, it is a problem
endemic to development finance institutions in countries with relatively high
inflation.
2.        This Annex demonstrates how alternative medium- and long-term
financing systems can contribute to coping with such a situation, and focuses
on the conditions required to generate such funding.
Evaluation of Alternative Medium- and
Long-Term Credit Systems for Colombia l/
3.        There are four main types of credit instruments:
(a) Fixed Interest Rate. Under inflationary conditions, price movement
expectations are high; thus lenders and borrowers do not find a
mutually-acceptable long-term interest rate;
(b) Fixed Interest Rate and Indexed Principal. Experience shows that,
on these terms, households tend to be willing, but corporations
reluctant to borrow on these terms; additionally, investors are
unwilling to lend;
(c) Floating Interest Rate. Under persistently high inflation, a large
part of the corresponding high nominal interest rate represents
repayment of real principal, which reduces the real/mean maturity
of the credit and usually imposes a heavy burden on the cash flow
of the borrower; and
(d) Floating Interest Rate and (partially) Capitalized Interest. There
has been almost no experience with such instruments.
4.        The adequacy of mediumr-and long-term credit systems can be
evaluated in terms of their contribution to a financial system's objective
of:2/
A. extending maturities;
/   The next paragraphs are based upon Veneroso, Frank J. "Colombia,
Interest Rate Policy Issues," July 1982.
2/   The objectives enumerated here correspond to those in the table in
paragraph 6.



- 60 -             Annex 2.1
Page 2 of 4
B. clearing the market through a saleable interest rate;
C. stabilizing the market; and
D. stabilizing prices.
5.        With these objectives in mind, the most promising variations of the
four main medium- and long-term credit instruments mentioned above can be
evaluated:
I.   Asset:       Long-term; fixed interest rate and indexed principal.
Liability:  Short-term deposit; fixed interest rate and indexed
principal.
II.  Asset:       Long-term; variable interest rate and indexed
principal.
Liability:  Short-term deposit; variable interest rate and indexed
principal.
III.  Asset:       Long-term; floating interest rate and (partially)
capitalized interest.
Liability:  Short-term, fixed interest rate.
IV.  Asset:       Long-term; fixed interest rate and indexed principal.
Liability:  Long-term bond; fixed interest rate and indexed
principal.
V.  Asset:       Long-term, floating interest rate and (partially)
capitalized interest.
Liability:  Long-term bond; floating interest rate and (partially)
capitalized interest.
6.        The table set out below summarizes the positive (+) or negative ()
contributions 3/ of each of these five variations to the stated
objectives.  Assignment of (+) or (-) is based upon the following
considerations:
(a) all variations contribute to extend maturities because they have
been so selected;
(b) only variable interest rate instruments of fixed interest rate
papers with flexible values produce the right interest rate. This
is also true for the stability of financial markets; and
3/   The table does not capture the intensity of effects; only their
direction.

(c)  only variable interest rate instruments "accompany" monetary
policy; indexed instruments project past inflation into the future.
Variations                       Objectives
A     B      C     D 4/
I                      +      _     _      _
II                      +      -     -      -
III                      +      +     +      +
IV                      +      +     +
V                      +      +     +      +
7.        According to this analysis, the better variations are V and III,5/
followed by IV.  In brief, the best systems have long-term assets with
floating interest rates and (partially) capitalized interest funded by either
short-term, fixed interest rate liabilities or by long-term bonds with
floating interest rates and (partially) capitalized interest. The next
alternative is long-term assets with fixed interest rate and indexed
principal financed by bonds of similar characteristics.
The Generation of Resources for
Medium- and Long-Term Lending b/
8.        The avenues for financing medium- and long-term lending are:
extending the term transformation of short-term resources and lengthening the
maturity of funding.
9.         Term Transformation.  Term transformation creates two main problems
for financial institutions, an interest rate and a liquidity risk. Interest
rate risk (the difference between lending and borrowing rates) can be
controlled by tying the floating interest rate of long-term assets to the
cost of short-term funds. This linkage reduces the interest rate risk to
variations in the institution's and the market's borrowing rates, and also
helps to reduce the liquidity risk. The only remaining rate risk is that of
official regulation of, or influence upon the interest rates of the
short-term instruments used for funding. Liquidity risk are reduced, first
and foremost, by the existence of a liberal financial syster--which tends to
reduce large transfers of funds between instruments--and central bank
rediscount facilities to cushion temporary drops in the level of funds raised
by the institutions.
4/   See paragraph 4.
5J   The reason for this ordering is explained in the following section.
6/   The following paragraphs are based upon Silva Lopes, J. "Colombia,
Resources for Mediumr and Long-Term Lending by The Corporaciones
Financieras," August 10, 1982.

Page 4 of 4
10.       Maturity of Resources.  In the previous section, the best
instruments to lengthen the maturity of resources are identified as medium-
and long-term bonds with a floating interest rate and (partially) capitalized
interest.7/ The design of such instrument can be sketched as follows:
(a)  Floating Interest Rate:  to be set at the beginning of each
quarter, by the last weekly 90-day interest rate index, plus a
constant spread, with maturity premia;
(b)  Risk of Capital Losses:  if official intervention is likely to
affect the index used to determine the floating interest rate, the
criteria for shifting to an alternative control-free index should
be predetermined;
(c)  Liquidity Risk:  bonds should be quoted in the stock exchange to
provide secondary liquidity. There should be neither a
stabilization (support) fund nor a guarantee of repurchase at par.
There should, however, be a limited liquidity fund, with the sole
function of providing a buyer or a seller if needed;8/
(d)  Maturity and Amortization:  three to five years (i.e., a 3-year
bond with repayment of 1/3 of its nominal value each year);
(e)  (Partially) Interest Capitalized:  the market should choose among
the three alternative methods:
(i) the rate of interest to be paid is set in advance and the rest
is capitalized. For example, the floating rate for the four
quarters of the year is 28.3%; if the rate of interest to be
paid is set at 8%, Lihen at the end of the year the institution
pays 8% and the remaining 21.3% is added to the principal, to
be paid at maturity);
(ii) the percentage to be amortized is predetermined and
capitalized; the rest is paid out as interest; and
(iii) the share of the total interest to be paid is pre-set, and the
rest capitalized.
11.       The first method is, in fact, preferable because it maintains the
amount of interest payment constant, thus facilitating financial planning and
cutting operational costs.
12.       Taxation.  Only real interest should be taxed; since real interest
is only known ex-post, it can be pegged ex ante by setting a de jure
anticipated monetary correction.
7/   The alternative of long-term bonds with fixed interest risk and indexed
principal follows far behind.
8/   Note that long-term bonds with fixed interest rate and indexed principal
require large stabilization funds.

Basis for FEN's Financial Projections
Liabilities and Sources
1.        Projected liabilities and sources are based on the following
assumptions:
(a) Capital Resources. FEN's shareholders complete in 1983 the paying
in of their capital subscriptions. The premium FEN's new share-
holders pay as late subscribers is included in profits. Any
further increase of capital resources comes from undistributed pro-
fits. Annual profits amount to about 5% of the sum of initial net
worth, including the increase due to inflation, deriving from net
income from operations. These profits are fully reflected in net
worth (Annex 2.4).
(b) Official Funds. The Government's direct contribution, as defined
in Resolution 37 of the Monetary Board is paid fully to FEN in
1984 (Annex 2.5).
As prescribed by CONPES, 4% of increase in legal reserves related
to CDTs placed by financial institutions is received by FEN, as of
January 1, 1984. (The figures for 1984 are FEN estimates.) From
1985 to 1987, the CDTs will increase at a rate which includes the
combined effects of the rate of inflation, the real growth rate of
the economy, an increment in monetization,1/ and a decrease in the
participation of the CDTs in total transferrable financial
savings.2/ The resulting rate is 25.10% for 1985; 25.22% for 1986
and 25.69% for 1987.
The 30% of IFI's share of ISS's constant value bonds is received by
FEN in 1984. Through 1987, ISS's constant value bonds are expected
to increase at a rate which includes the combined effects of the
rate of inflation,3/ and the growth rate of the formal labor
force4/ (2% annually). The resulting rate is 26.48% for 1984;
22.4% for 1985, 1986 and 1987.
The results are shown in Annex 2.5.
1/   The ratio of transferable financial savings to gross domestic product
grew from 13% in 1976 to 22% in 1981 and 1982. It was projected as
follows: 22.0% in 1983; 22.7% in 1984; 23.5% in 1985; 24.2% in 1986 and
25.0% in 1987.
2/   1.5% annually.
3/   A proxy for the rate of interest in formal nominal wages.
4/   The growth of the formal labor force is equal to total labor growth
minus informal labor.

Annex 2.2

(c) Local Investors. The amount of funds that FEN can obtain in the
domestic capital market were calculated in Chapter 3.
Assets and Uses
2.        Projected assets and uses are based on the following assumptions:
(a) Liquidity. FEN's liquidity is projected based upon the assumption
that FEN would maintain a liquidity buffer comprised of the equiva-
lent of two months of estimated annual expenses, as reflected in
FEN's income statement, plus one month of the estimated principal
amount that would become due and payable to local investors during
the year in question. This would serve to cushion FEN against
asynchronic collections and payments, and/or to provide secondary
liquidity (Annex 2.13).
(b) Credit to Power Companies. The total amount of outstanding credit
to the power companies at the end of each year is the difference
between total assets and liabilities, and liquidity and fixed and
other assets, at the same date. In turn, this credit is divided
into outstanding FDE credits and others. New (net) credit to the
power companies during each year is the difference between that
outstanding at the end and at the beginning of the year (Annex
2.13).
(c) Fixed and Other (Net) Assets. These amount to 1% of the FEN's net
worth (Annex 2.13).
A Summary of the Projections
3.        Annex 2.13 summarizes FEN's assets and liabilities, and sources and
uses of funds during 1983-87.

i/  By Monetary Board Resolution No. 37 of 1982, BR is authorized to invest
Col$3,000 million in FEN's CDTs, or other paper that FEN may issue, pro-
vided that these proceeds are used exclusively to finance medium and
long-term loans to the electricity companies. BR's investment is to be
effected by using 4% of the incremental legal reserves held by BR deriving
from the CDTs placed by financial institutions. FEN will pay interest of
0.5% above the rate that BR pays the financial institutions for the funds
(currently about 21%). BR would renew its investment in FEN semi-annual-
ly, but there is no assurance that these funds would be reinvested in-
definitely. Additionally, CONPES has recommended assigning to FEN 4%
annually of the increase in the reserves deriving from these CDTs, begin-
ning January 1, 1983. For the purposes of these financial projections,
however, it is assumed that the funds would be invested in FEN beginning
in 1984.
2/  Article 6 of Law 11 of 1982 establishes that FEN will receive 30% of the
proceeds managed by IFI of ISS' Bonds, representing 12% of the total pro-
ceeds of the Bonds. The amounts managed by IFI from this source has
increased from Col$1,113 million in 1979 to Col$2,328 million in 1982, as
verified by the Controlaria General de la Republica. The funds are repay-
able by FEN over 25 years at an interest rate of 5.5% over inflation.

sector.

1/ This represents the FDE promissory notes endorsed by the Government to FEN.
2/ Retained earnings represent 100% of net income.
3/ The power companies may receive more lending than the above data indicate from local
sources to the extent that participating local banks add some of their own funds in the
rediscount arrangement.
4/ Does not include short-term local funds mobilized from investors; these are continuously
rolled over. During the projection period, amortized debt derives from official funds
(see Annex 2.5).
5/ The portion of loans to power companies representing onlending by FEN of external loan
proceeds is revalued for effects of devaluation. External obligations are similarly
revalued.

PROJECTIONS OF THE HOLDINGS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
1.        This annex describes the methods used to project the holdings of
financial assets in Colombia during the period 1982-87. Shortly, the
procedure consisted of: (a) estimating demand functions for financial
assets; (b) deriving income elasticity coefficients from (a) above; (c)
projecting holdings of financial assets on the basis of income elasticity
coefficients and alternative assumptions on the performance of the Colombian
economy to 1987.
Demand Functions
2.        Demand functions for real financial assets were estimated on the
basis of quarterly data supplied by the Banco de la Republica for the period
1974-81. Given the deep changes that occurred in the Colombian financial
sector as of 1974, no attempt was made to extend the sample period to earlier
years. The use of quarterly data, thus, yielded 32 observations.
3.        Quarterly estimates of nominal GDP are the preliminary result of
work done by Dr. Martha Lee, of the Research Department of the Banco de la
Republica. They are not official estimates yet. These data, as well as the
data on holdings of financial assets, were deflated with the wholesale price
index. The data used in the regression analysis appears in Table A.1.

Annex 3.6
Page 2 of 6
4.        Regression equations were estimated through ordinary least squares,
according to the following formats:
(1)  LM1K    a + bLGDPK + cLTEI + dlDl + d2D2 + d3D3
(2) LRAMK = a + bLGDPK + cLTEI + dlDl + d2D2 + d3D3
where
LM1K =        Log of currency and demand deposits (Ml),
in real terms.
LGDP =        Log of GDP, in real terms.
LTEI =        Log of average interest rate on interest earning,
financial assets.
D1, D2, D3 = Seasonal (quarterly) dummy variables (1,0).
LRAMK =       Log of other financial assets, in real terms.
5.        The detailed results of the regression analysis appear in Tables
A.2 and A.3. The estimated equations explain 91% of the variation in the



- 84 -
Annex 3.6
Page 3 of 6
dependant variable in the case of equation (1) and 93% of the variation in
the dependant variable in the case of equation (2). The income elasticity
coefficients are 1.26 for currency and demand deposits and 3.86 for other
financial assets; both are significantly different from zero at the 1% signi-
ficance level. The interest rate variable is significantly negative in
equation (1) and not significant in equation (2).
6.        The income elasticity coefficient for Mi, 1.26, is quite consistent
with other estimates of the demand for money in Colombia and can be used
without further ado for projection purposes. However, the income elasticity
coefficient for other financial assets is extremely high, 3.86, reflecting
the rapid growth of the financial sector after the liberalizing reforms of
1974. It would be misleading to use this coefficient for the projection
period because the effects of the liberalizing reforms can now be considered
exhausted, and no further liberalization is expected.
7.        In order to choose an elasticity coefficient for projecting  other
financial assets, an analysis was done of the sensitivity of this variable
(coefficient b in equation (2) above) with respect to the choice of sample
period for regression analysis. The procedure adopted consisted of
estimating equation (2) for successively shorter sample periods (i.e.
starting with 1974-1981, continuing with 1975-1981, 1976-1981, etc.) The
full results are presented in Table A.4. The elasticity coefficients
estimated for different sample periods were:

1977-81       1.37          .55         .87            20
1978-81       1.37          .94         .78            16
1979-81       1.88         1.15         .92            12
1980-81       2.11         1.41         .91             8
8.        The estimated elasticity coefficient declines sharply when the
years 1974, 1975, and 1976 are eliminated from the sample period.  The
minimum of the estimated coefficients, 1.37, was the one chosen for
projecting "other financial assets."
9.        On the basis of these income elasticities, and of the macroeconomic
hypothesis outlined in the main text, holdings of financial assets were
projected as follows.

Mesitas Hydroelectric Project - Loan 1628-CO
Supplemental Financing
Background
1.        The Mesitas Hydroelectric Power Project, consisting of:  Pumping
Station for Muna Head Pond, El Paraiso Power Plant (270 MW), La Guaca Power
Plant (330 MW), the necessary transmission works, and the strengthening of
the Sesquile dam was appraised by the Bank in late 1977 - early 1978. A loan
of US$84 million to EEEB (para 1.14) was approved by the Board in November
1978 and the loan becam- effective in August 1979. The project, designed to
generate about 2000 Gwh/year in an average year, was originally scheduled to
be completed in early 1982. Due to a number of reasons, explained below,
completion of the generation and transmission components is now expected in
mid-1984. The strengthening of the Sesquile dam will be completed in 1985.
Original cost estimate and financing plan
2.        The total estimated cost of the project (excluding interest during
construction) (See Attachment 1) at the time of appraisal was US$260.8
million of which US$148.4 million (57%) was foreign. The financing plan that
was envisaged at that time considered US$54.2 from suppliers credits and
commercial banks, US$10.2 from FED (Fondo de Desarrollo Electrica) and EEEB
would finance the local cost amounting to US$112.4 million from its own
internal cash generation.
Project Implementation
3.        Project execution encountered one serious geological problem in
executing the underground works. During the Granada II tunnel excavation a
soft rock spot was hit and had to be bypassed. This caused a delay of more
than 12 months. Additional delays were caused by financial difficulties that
EEEB faced in 1981 and 1982 mainly due to a loss of revenues of about US$40
million in 1981 due to rationing imposed by severe hydrological conditions -
a very dry year. These financial difficulties in turn contributed to the
bankruptcy of the contractor responsible for the construction of the two
power houses. In 1983 the situation improved because EEEB was able to
contract the construction of the power houses with another contractor and no
more difficulties are now expected
Revised cost estimate
4.        As can be seen from the attached cost estimates, the higher cost of
US$145.5 million is due to:
a) increase in the base cost of the civil works due to (1)
increased cost of tunnelling because of geological difficulties
and (2) the need to build an additional spillway to assure the
security of the Mesitas complex.

ANNEX 4.1
Attachment 1
Page 2 of 3
b) increase in the base cost of equipment, in particular the
penstock.
c) price contingencies are more than double the original estimate
due to a major part to higher inflation in the earlier years
than expected and to a minor part to the two years delay in
project completion.
5.        Notwithstanding the substantial cost increase, the project, the
scope of which could not be decreased since the components in the sizes
originally planned have been committed, remains economically justified.
a) The cost per Kw installed (calculated in >98O prices) of Mesitas
is US$670, which compares favorably with the unit cost for
Guavio of US$800 and for Guadalupe of US$670, two other
hydroelectric projects which the Bank is financing partially in
Colombia.
b) The internal rate of return of the project has increased
with respect to the appraisal estimate as electricity tariffs
(the measure of benefits) have increased 66% more than cost
(1983 figures).
6.        The new financing plan is shown with the attached cost estimates.
It envisages that FEN would lend a total of US$62.9 million to cover a part
of the foreign cost overrun of Mesitas. US$43.2 million would be financed by
Bank funds and US$19.7 would be financed by funds from the commercial banks.
All disbursements would be made against contracts let under the Bank's
guidelines. The local cost overrun would be financed by EEEB from its own
internal cash generation. The US$43.2 million includes US$12 million of
retroactive financing. I

Financial Projection Parameters
1.          The electric sector financial consolidation consists of an aggre-
gation of the financial statements of the individual electric companies,
forecast on a homogeneous basis. The inter-company accounts and transactions
that cancel out each other have been compensated for or eliminated in two
steps: (a) ICEL and CORELCA and their "electrificadoras"; and (b) ISA and
its shareholders. Several simplifications to correct for different account-
ing or projecting approaches have been used in calculating certain global
items (i.e. purchased energy, other operating costs, ncn-operating income,
etc.); therefore, some consolidated financial items may differ slightly from
the individual original statements. These adjustments give the consolidation
an acceptable degree of uniformity and coherence. However, minor errors may
subsist.
2.          Basic projection parameters were agreed with ISA and its share-
holders in early 1982: (a) energy balance: based on an agreed projected
demand, sector expansion and generation programs, energy inter-changes,
tariff for interchanges in the interconnected system, commissioning sche-
dules, construction programs (updated in May 1983 and February 1984); (b)
estimated international and domestic inflation rates and rates of exchange as
projected at that time (Table 1 below); (c) annual asset revaluation using
estimated domestic inflation rates; (d) tariff increases projected indivi-
dually by each company, according to its particular financial situation; (e)
depreciations, operating costs and working capital requirements estimated
with adequate projection criteria based on the recent historic experience;
(f) capital contributions from national budgetary resources to ICEL, CORELCA
and ISA (through CORELCA for the 500-kV Interconnection); (g) reasonable
availability of external financing from international institutions, commer-
cial banks -- through FEN or directly -- and suppliers for foreign components
of construction programs; and (h) availability of local financing from: (i)
(refinancing of long-term debt and local component of construction programs);
and (ii) FONADE, for studies.
