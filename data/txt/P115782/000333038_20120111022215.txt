          SIERRA LEONE EFA-FTI EDUCATION SECTOR PROJECT

                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER




SUMMARY
1.      The Sierra Leone Education for All Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) Project is
scheduled to close on December 31, 2011. Implementation has been uneven, and the
project requires a moderate restructuring and a second extension of nine months in order
to complete some critical activities and achieve its development objective. The Project
Development Objective (PDO) to “expand access to and improve the quality of basic
education in the Recipient’s territory? will not change. This restructuring proposes to: (i)
extend the project closing date to September 30, 2012; (ii) reduce procurement of civil
works (i.e. number of classrooms constructed from 318 to 285) and other inputs to focus
on a few key system-building activities such as supporting the government’s Girls’
Incentive Program at the Junior Secondary School (JSS) level; (iii) introduce additional
capacity building and support for the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology
(MEST); (iv) modify selected key performance indicators in the Results Framework; and
(v) reallocate grant proceeds among the disbursement categories. It will also introduce
related modifications to the descriptions of Components 1, 2 and 3 [Article II, Paragraph
2.01 (a), (b) and (c)] of the project in the Financing Agreement.


PROJECT STATUS
2.      Background. The EFA FTI Education Sector Project (the Project) to expand
access and to improve quality of basic education in Sierra Leone was approved on
September 2, 2008 with the funding of US$13,900,000. The Project was declared
effective on September 15, 2008. The original Closing Date was June 30, 2010, extended
to December 31, 2011.

3.      Implementation Progress. The Sierra Leone EFA-FTI Project witnessed a
difficult start-up due to underestimated, yet common capacity constraints found in a Post
Conflict country, a focus on inputs which caused procurement delays, as well as other
design issues including premature mainstreaming of project implementation into the
MEST without adequate support. The Closing Date was extended in June 2010 to address
the delay in effectiveness (the grant was awarded by the EFA-FTI Board in May 2007).
The implementation of the Project only gained momentum in December 2010. As a
result, several key project activities are not fully implemented or able to help reach the
development objectives. As of October 2011, only 26 of the 57 schools procured in 2009
have been completed. The restructuring will reduce the scope of the civil works and
                                            iii
cancel the procurement of an additional 17 schools. Moreover, lack of coordination
between the MEST and Local Councils (LC) resulted in delays in getting learning
materials and furniture into schools; and capacity within the Education Sector Plan (ESP)
Secretariat remains weak. Project indicators have also proved difficult to measure
because baselines have been found to be faulty and a few of the indicators are not
attributable to project interventions.

4.      The project was downgraded in February 2011 to Moderately Unsatisfactory
due to slow disbursements, lack of Financial Management monitoring and reporting, and
lack of results on the ground. Significant progress has been made since that time: (i)
disbursements have increased from 22 percent to 64 percent; (ii) all Interim Financial
Management Reports (IFR) were submitted and are up to date; (iii) the 2009 and 2010
Annual Audits were submitted; and (iv) more progress has been made with respect to the
supply of teaching and learning materials as well as teacher training. Should this
restructuring go forward, and once the Project completes the agreed actions related to the
qualified Audit, which is expected by the end of December, the project will be upgraded
to Moderately Satisfactory. All project activities have complied with social and
environmental safeguard requirements. (See Annex 4 for the agreed Action Plan.)

5.     The highest levels of the Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) have indicated
commitment to improving project performance. It is receiving attention from various
Ministries, including the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MOFED), and
is being monitored by a Presidential Task Force for Education. The Ministry of Local
Government (MOLG), the Local Government Finance Department (LGFD), the
Decentralization Secretariat (DecSec), and units within the MEST such as Directorates of
Higher Education and Planning are fully engaged in implementation and oversight, which
was not previously the case. The proposed restructuring/extension will therefore provide
the opportunity for the Government agencies to address these implementation issues.

6.      OP 13.30, paragraph 3 on Closing Date provides for extensions when: (i) the
project objectives continue to be achievable; (ii) the performance of the Recipient and
other project implementing agencies is satisfactory; and (iii) the Recipient has prepared a
specific action plan acceptable to the International Development Association (IDA) to
complete the existing contracts and agreements. The project objectives are achievable and
the Recipient has prepared an action plan acceptable to the Education Development
Partners (EDPs) and IDA. Recipient performance has been weaker than hoped, but the
team believes that the Sierra Leone Post Conflict/Fragile State context warrants
additional assistance. The project effectively became an experiment in mainstreaming
project execution into the Ministry which created significant obstacles, and has learned
that resources need to be targeted to providing the skills necessary to support
implementation. Government commitment and mitigation measures are described below.
As has been noted above, the proposed Project Restructuring will provide the time and
appropriate support to the MEST to complete ongoing activities related to learning
materials and civil works, and better mainstream the project across the MEST and other
relevant ministries to ensure the project investments will be sustained.

PROPOSED CHANGES
7.       The Government of Sierra Leone began discussions on an extension/restructuring
of the project in June 2011, and formally submitted the request for extension of the Sierra
Leone EFA-FTI Program project on November 24, 2011 (see Annex 5) after achieving
agreed milestones appraised at a Video Conference held November 16 (see Minutes of
the Meeting Annex 6). The project development objective (PDO) is aligned with Sierra
Leone Education Sector Plan (ESP 2007-2015) and will not be modified. However, there
are several changes that are being suggested under this project restructuring: (i) the PDO
indicators and the intermediate outcome indicators will be modified because they are not
realistic given the current stage of project implementation and capacity; (ii) some of the
project component activities will be modified to ensure increasing impact and to wrap-up
the project in an orderly fashion; (iii) flows of funds will be adjusted to avoid delays and
redundancy along with relevant improvements reporting requirements; and (iv) the
Closing Date of the project will be extending from December 31, 2011 to September 30,
2012.

8.      Project Indicators. The PDO outcome indicators and intermediate outcome
indicators will be revised to be more aligned with the PDO and Core Indicators for the
education sector. The Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) has been difficult to measure due to
faulty baseline and mid-term data. Therefore, the trends in GER paint a complex and
counterintuitive picture: they appear to have fluctuated for undocumented reasons.
Completion Rate at the primary level will be added as a PDO Key Project Indicator to
replace GER. It is both a Core Indicator and Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for
the education sector. Completion Rate is also a relatively good indication of efficiencies
for both quality and access and has been reliably measured.

9.      The intermediate indicators of the number of primary level students and number
of Grade 1 entrants will also be dropped. As with GER, the baseline and mid-term data
for these indicators have been found to be unreliable. The ‘teacher payroll system’
indicator will be dropped because this exercise is not financed by the project and is being
done in the context of broader Public Sector Reform. Under Component 1 of improving
access, the procurement and completion of school classroom construction has proved
problematic, so the target will be reduced from 318 classrooms to 285. In its place, the
project will finance the ongoing Girls’ Incentive Program at the Junior Secondary School
level (see Annex 1 for the revised indicators).

10.     Components. The project components will not be substantially changed in the
restructuring. All investments will continue to support progress in the areas of improving
access, quality and program management. As per the PAD, project activities are agreed
among the EDPs, MEST and IDA based on an Annual Work Plan and Budget. The
activities may change from time-to-time based on educational needs of the basic
education system in Sierra Leone. The original PAD listed activities that the project was
to support however, some activities were dropped because they were financed and
undertaken with support from another agency during the delay in project effectiveness
from May 2007 until September 15, 2008. During the restructuring period, new activities,
based on the government’s request, will be added to shift away from an input based-
                                             3
approach to working on incremental, systemic improvements in service delivery. Annex
5 provides details on the modifications to each project component. A summary of the
main modifications to the project components are as follows:

        (i)    revision of the classroom construction target from 318 to 285 due to slow
                implementation;
        (ii)   inclusion of a national de-worming program based on a Helen Keller
                Institute program that has already been successfully implemented in seven
                districts. The program is expected to be completed within 4 months (from
                February to May 2012);
        (iii) inclusion of support for the government’s girls’ incentive program. The
                project will provide one year of support to the government’s ongoing
                girls’ incentive program. The project will first validate the number of girls
                in school and then make a one-time transfer to the MEST to provide
                support for one academic year;
        (iv) printing and distribution of Braille supplementary readers and junior
                secondary school (JSS) textbooks. Primary level materials were
                successfully procured and distributed;
        (v)    implementation of a policy framework for learning assessment;
        (vi) training on test development in primary mathematics and language;
        (vii) review and revision of ten additional curricula and the printing of the
                revised curricula. The project has already supported the review and
                revision of basic curricula for four JSS which was successfully
                completed; and
        (viii) training of school management committees. This is a new one week
                training activity and is expected to be completed by May 2012.

11.     Grant Agreement. The Grant Agreement will be revised to be less specific, and
to broaden the scope of activities which are financed and undertaken to support achieving
the development objective. It will also remove those activities which are not in the
purview of the MEST or feasible in the context of a project of this size and scope. These
are further described below. The revised description of the components in the Grant
Agreement (Article II, Paragraph 2.01 (a), (b) and (c) of the Grant Agreement) will be as
follows:

     (a)       Implementation of activities aimed at expanding access to basic education
     which may include, inter alia: (i) construction and rehabilitation of various school
     facilities including ancillary facilities such as latrines and water supply; (ii)
     incentives for girls at the Junior Secondary School level to attend and stay in
     school; and (iii) Local Council and Community-based awareness activities to
     promote Basic Education.
     (b)       Implementation of activities aimed at improving teaching and learning and
     increasing the presence and use of learning materials in the classroom which may
     include, inter alia: (i) provision of learning materials, teacher training and furniture;
     (ii) assessment of training provided through the project for primary and JSS


                                             4
       teachers; and (iii) other activities which may improve the ability of children to learn
       (e.g.: deworming or other interventions).

       (c)      Provision of support for the coordination, day-to-day management,
       monitoring and evaluation, and financial and procurement audits of the Program
       and the Project.
12.     Safeguards. There are no changes to the environment and social safeguards for
the project.

13.    Institutional arrangements. The institutional arrangements will be modified as
follows:

   •    Financing - Certain flows of funds will be adjusted to avoid delays and
        redundancy, and relevant reporting procedures will be simplified. Specifically, the
        funds currently paid to the Local Council education accounts through the Local
        Government Finance Department will now be paid directly to the LC education
        accounts, copying the LGFD for information (see Appraisal Section below).

   •    Reallocations - The project originally had one category of expenditure which
        covered all anticipated project costs. The Girls Incentive Program will be
        disbursed to Junior Secondary School accounts. Therefore a new category of
        Grants will be added and $1.4 million allocated to cover the incentives. Section
        3.02 of the Letter of Agreement has been amended to reflect the Withdrawal
        Condition for the incentives (see paragraph 26 under Financial Assessment
        below).

APPRAISAL SUMMARY
16.   Economic and financial analysis. The project interventions do not lead to any
changes in the economic or technical appraisal as per the Project Document.

17.       Technical. Not applicable.

18.      Procurement Assessment of Capacity, Risks and Mitigation Measures. The
overall project risk for procurement is High. An assessment of the capacity of the MEST
to implement procurement actions for the restructured project was carried out by the
procurement team in December 2011. The assessment reviewed the organizational
structure for implementing the project and the interaction between the project’s staff
responsible for procurement and the MEST. Most of the issues/risks concerning
procurement in the project remain, notably inadequate experience and capacity of the
procurement unit within the MEST to manage procurement under Bank financed projects.
Although the Ministry has been assigned a procurement officer, the staff requires further
training and mentoring to manage the procurement function. Efforts to hire a qualified
procurement specialist have not been successful as those recommended for recruitment
are still awaiting the award of their degrees from the University and do not have the
requisite experience implementing World Bank projects.

19.     Risk mitigation measures have included continued capacity training and
mentoring with the support of the Bank procurement team. Furthermore, the restructuring
will not include new construction so there will be no new works contracts. Procurement
for the restructured project will be limited to: (i) direct contracting for supplementary
readers in Braille; (ii) completion of an evaluation of bids for pencils, geometry sets,
exercise books etc; and (iii) selection and employment of firms and/or individuals as
consultants for: (a) girl child education support; (b) evaluation of 1 year distance
education teacher training; (c) preparation of policy framework for learning assessment;
                                             6
(d) training on test development for language and mathematics; (e) revision of syllabus
for 14 subjects; and (iv) least cost selection of consultants for the financial audit and
procurement audit.

20.    To manage these procurement activities, the Ministry will rely on the current
arrangement of using the services of the Procurement Specialists with experience in
World Bank procedures in other projects in line Ministries working as a team. The
Ministry confirmed that approval processes would not be delayed as the Education
Presidential Task Force of the set up by the Office of the President will monitor and
supervise all operations.

21.    If these arrangements are closely followed and monitored by the Ministry, it is
expected that procurement envisaged will be completed by project closure.

22.     Financial Management (FM) Assessment. The overall project risk for Financial
Management is Substantial. The broad financial management arrangements of the
restructured project will remain largely the same. The responsibilities for project FM will
be carried out by the recently recruited but experienced Financial Management
Consultant in the ESP Secretariat in the MEST. The project FM arrangements currently
meet the minimum requirements for financial management systems with its internal
controls and staffing, financial reporting compliance (the audit reports and IFR). The
issues and recommendations raised by the project auditors and Bank IFR reviews are
being addressed.

23.    As indicated, the FM arrangements remain the same, however the funds-flow
arrangements have been modified slightly for the new activity, namely transfers to
schools in support of girl’s incentives for JSS. The transfers to the approximately 600
Junior Secondary Schools to support girls’ education are to be done through the project’s
Education Sector Support Framework (ESSF) local currency account to each school bank
account, given the minimal grant amount per school.

24.     Payments to schools will be in line with enrollment figures. It will be done during
the second term after a validation exercise has been conducted based on the November
2011 school census. It will be supported by the certificate of enrollment figures issued by
the MEST inspectorate division and a monitoring report by an independent body. These
figures would be validated by the MEST Inspectorate in collaboration with an
independent body, the Presidential Task Force (which includes members from the Anti
Corruption Commission), and the MOFED. Another small modification entails payments
for contractors at the local council (LC) level. The project has transferred money through
the Local Government Finance Department to the local council dedicated education
account. To streamline the process and avoid delays, the funds will now be transferred
directly to the LC education accounts with a letter copying the LGFD. The detailed flow
arrangements will be documented in the updated ESSF FM procedures manual.

25.   To reflect this process of validation of Girls Incentives, the Section 3.02 of the
Annex to the Agreement has been amended to read as follows:

                                            7
      “3.02.     Withdrawal Conditions. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.01
      of this Agreement, no withdrawal shall be made:

      (a) For payments made prior to the date of countersignature of this Agreement by the
          Recipient; and
      (b) under Category (2), unless the Recipient has furnished to the World Bank,
          evidence satisfactory to the World Bank, that for each fiscal year, a consolidated
          report on said transfers has been validated by an independent third party, and that
          said consolidated report is of appropriate quality."

26.     In line with the new modifications, a brief assessment was done for this new
arrangement, confirming that these arrangements are well structured and in line with
current operations in the portfolio. The project will continue to use transaction-based
disbursement (SOE) against full documentation, in line with the thresholds as stated in
the Bank’s Disbursement Letter, while maintaining method of direct payment to the
suppliers and LC where applicable. Supporting documentation will be retained by the
implementing agencies (MEST and LGFD/LCs) for review by the Bank/EDP missions
and external auditors. The project will continue to support the LCs with continuous
monitoring and training to ensure the project meets its fiduciary requirements. The LCs
will receive funds directly from the project, sending information by copy to the LGFD.
The LCs will also submit their financial reports directly to the project, similarly copying
LGFD. The financial reports have been simplified to make this reporting possible. The
detailed flow arrangements and steps will be incorporated in the project financial
management procedures manual.

27.     The FM assessment concludes that the FM system of the project continues to be
satisfactory and the new flow of funds arrangements, to be included in the ESSF revised
FM procedures manual, meet the Bank’s FM minimum requirements for financial
management system in compliance with OP/BP 10.02.

28.      Social. Not applicable.

29.      Environment. Not applicable.

30.      Exceptions to Bank Policy. Not applicable.

31.    Risks. The overall risk rating for this operation is Substantial. The rating is
based on the fact that the original project had several design and implementation
problems that caused project delays and jeopardized the prospects for reaching the project
development objectives. The issues were identified and the risks have been mitigated
with the modifications to the project and the restructuring of the intermediate indicators.

2.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to allow the project to finance and improve
the system for managing and monitoring a Girls Incentive Program for all girls who
attend Junior Secondary School (Grades 7-9). The program will finance the fees of girls
as follows: Grade 7 for all three terms, Grade 8 for two of three terms, and Grade 9 for
one out of three terms. It will assist in improving access to and retention in JSS for girls
and is consistent with the PDO. Increase in gender parity at the JSS level was an
intermediate indicator, and will be ‘upgraded’ to a Key Project Indicator.

                   ANNEX 3: Extension of Closing Date
                    SIERRA LEONE - SIERRA LEONE EFA FTI PROGRAM
                                  P115782 - TF092755

                                       Restructuring Paper

1. The Closing Date for the Sierra Leone EFA FTI Education Sector Project (TF092755-P115782)
will be extended from December 31, 2011 until September 30, 2012.

2. The following points provide evidence of the Government’s effort to improve the project
implementation:

 (a) the original design of the project and the resulting work plan, which focused mainly on inputs
     that led to procurement delays, has been redesigned to focus on activities that would impact
     on system change and quality, thereby improving the implementation profile;

 (b) other relevant ministries (Finance, Local Government) and units (Decentralization
     Secretariat), Local Government Finance Department (LGFD) working under the Integrated
     Project Administrative Unit (IPAU) are now represented in the planning and implementation
     meetings;

 (c) the planning and implementation of the various activities is being mainstreamed into the
     broader MEST rather than the Education Sector Plan (ESP Secretariat);

 (d) there will be more joint planning with the Decentralization Secretariat (DECSEC) and the
     local councils as the project implementation progresses;

 (e) the flow of funds to contractors and local councils will be streamlined to involve the Local
     Government Finance Department as a monitor, but not a conduit for payments;

 (f) the project will now utilize a Rapid Results Approach (RRA) for implementation at the
     community level;

 (g) the presence of a newly recruited finance officer has impacted significantly on performance
     in the submission of the Quarterly Financial Management Reports, the execution of the
     outstanding Audit activity for 2009 and 2010, and the increase in the disbursement rate from
     2 percent in two years (June 2009-June 2011) to 64 percent. Furthermore, the recruitment of
     four (4) additional staff in the ESP Secretariat will improve its capacity to implement
     effectively and efficiently the newly designed detailed work plans, including the detailed time
     frame; and

 (h) the project is now on the prioritized list of activities of the Government of Sierra Leone, and
     is being monitored by the Education Task Force set up by the Office of the President.

3. The proposed extension is necessary to enable to Government of Sierra Leone to complete the
project activities needed to achieve the project objectives.

4.        This will be the second extension of the project. The first was in June 2010 to extend the
project until December 31, 2011 in order to accommodate the delay in effectiveness from mid 2007
until                                       December                                          2008.
