PROJECT CONPLEtSION *RPORT
CHAD
COTTON EMERGENCY PROGRAM
(CRIT lil6-CK)
mm UT$SM4E19tRY
Proram Objectivea
The Cotton Emergency Program (CEP) is the first phase of a Medium
Term Restructuring Program designed to restore oustainability of cottou
production in Chad. This program covered two years, 1986/87 and 1987/88,
and was designed to reduce the financial deficits in the cotton sub-sector;
important arrears vis-a-vis the banking system had been accumulated by
Cotontchad, the national company entrusted with processing and export of
cotton, and these amounted to levels beyond the repayment capacity of both
Cotontchad and the Government of Chad. The CEP focussed on a) reducing
Cotontchad's production costs; b) improving Cotontchad's management; c)
improving fanm level productivityg d) identifying follow up measures to be
executed in a subsequent phase of the restructuring program.
Program ml_ementation
Program implementation was good, and the Program's Coordination Unit
performed well. In addition, creation by Government of a Cotton Committee
to design and to monitor the program's implementation was very useful and
helped among others, to ensure coordination among donors, and between
donors and the Government. However, early implementation was difficult due
to the Borrower's lack of familiarity with Bank procedures, and also to the
fragile political situation of the country, reflecting the consequences of
a recent war. While cost reduction measures - the program's principal
aim - were fully implemented, implementation of other measures, namely to
improve productivity within Cotontchad and at the farm level, was less
satisfactory. Perhaps, this reflects the emergencyg nature of the
program. The program preparation timetable was too tight to provide a good
appreciation of the magnitude of Cotontchad's management and farm level
production problems.
Program's Results
Program results were very successful. Cotontchad's financial
situation particularly during 1987188, the second year of the CEP,
outperformed the program target. Against an objective of a negative cash-
flow of ClAP 4.6 billion, the actual deficit was only CFA? 1.8 billion. In
addition, Cotontchad's adherence to the recommendation to purchase farm
inputs through bids provided important savings to the sector. Thus, the
impact on the farmers of the elimination of input subsidies was, to a large
extent, mitigated by the lower cost of inputs. However, improvement of
Cotontchad's management was limited, as was the performance of ONDR, the
national extension agency. Measures to address these questions have been
formulated and represent an important. -omponent of the second phase of the
Restructuring Program currently under 4.cecution.



- iv -
Sustainabilitv of the Proaras
The Restructuring Program has been successful and is being mustained
in a second phase. Cost reduction measures have been intemnalized within
Cotontchad and together with management improvement, continue to be an
important component of the ongoing Restructuring Program. On extension,
the CEP has paved the way for a progressive improvement. A more clear
division of responsibilities has been established between Cotontchad and
ONDR, with the latter focusing on giving advices more tailored to farmers'
needs.
Lessons Learned
Despite the success of the CEP, in retrospect, it appears that the
program was too ambitious. Thi is so not because of the large number of
activities included in the program, but because of the timing of their
implementation. For instance, improvement in both Cotontchad management
and farm level productivity as well as diversification of agricultural
production were expected to be realized during the two-year program. Yet,
the program was an emergency operation; that is it had to be prepared
quickly; in addition, Bank staff had little familiarity with the Chadian
conditions because operations had been suspended for many years due to the
war.
Aside from the cost reduction measures which indeed have been well
identified and planned, the CEP should have focused during the last year of
the CEP, not before, on a diagnosis - without attempting to find quick
solutions - of Cotontchad's management issues and of the agricultural
extension services.  This may have generated recommendations to be
implemented during the subsequent pilase. Unfortunately, the diagnosis was
attempted too early, thus ineffectilely. and will have to be pursued during
the second phase.

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSP)rTTVF,
1.   The Proiect
Names       Emergency Rehabilitation Program for the Cotton Subsector
Credit ts   1716-CD
VP:         Africa Region
Countrys    Chad
Sector:     Agriculture
2.    Background
2.01     The cotton subsector plays a key role in the performance of the
Chadian economy. In 1985, for example, cotton accounted for S0 percent of
Chad's exports and 25 percent of government revenue. The subsector absorbs
50 percent of domestic lending, constitutes the principal source of income
for two fifths of the population, and represents one third of the country's
industrial activity.
2.02     In the  arly eighties. the Chadian economy was back on the road to
recover5 following the hostilities of 1978-1981. By 1983/84, GNP stood at
78 percent of its pre-war (1977) level, and the government had started to
replenish its reserves of foreign exchange and revenue. But the economy
then started to experience severe setbacks, starning with the devastating
drought of 1984/85, which resulted in a food shortage estimated at 300,000
tons, but mainly as a consequence of poor performance in the cotton
subsector.
2.03    Under the combined influence of falling prices and a lower US
Dollar, cotton ezport prices fell from CPAF 800/kg in 1984 to CYAF 400/kg
in 1985. The subsector's deficit was up to CFAF 18.1 billion ($40 million)
in 1984185 and CEAF 19.2 billion ($53 million) in 1985/86. Moreover, by
1986, Cotontchad, the parastatal agency handling cotton marketing. was in
debt to the tune of almost CFAP 50 billion ($138 million). The prospects
for an upturn in cotton prices were bleak, since world market stocks had
now reached 10 million tons, or the equivalent of eight months'
consumption.
2.04     Cotontchad had seen a serious deterioration in its operations.
While its production costs had been below average for West Africa up to
1984, there was a complete reversal of the situation in 1984/85, when its
production corts were amng the region's highest, considerably outpacing
export prices. The company's management audit system was inefficient,
undesirable investments had been made, the necessary reorganizationAl
measures (reduction of the number of plants in operation, restriction on



the size of the area cultivated to cotton, staff cuts) had not been taken
in time, the company was paying out large subsidies (50 percent) on
agricultural inputs, and government taxes had resched 270 percent with no
provioion for price stabilization.
2.05     Cotontchad was not in a position either to finance the 1986 crop
year or to moet its financial obligations, which already totaled CFAP 4.2
billion for 1985186. loveover, the State was unable to make up the
subsector's deficits, which in 1985 and 1,  exceeded government revenues.
In November 1985, since the situation could have potentially serious
consequences in the economic, social and political areas, the government
called upon its donors for assistance.
2.06     The World Bank was appointed lead institution for the design of an
emergency rehabilitation program for the cotton subsector, in connection
with which the government had already introduced a number of measures.
These include the replacement of Cotontchad's management personnel and the
introduction of an improved monitoring system for the company's financial
activities. In addition, the government set up a committee to study the
cotton subsector, the Comit6 de reflexion sur la filiere coton, which was
entrusted with submitting for governmens approval a consistent
restructuring program for the subsector, and also with seeking donor
assistance for the program's implementation.
3.    Program Description and Objectives
3.01     The government's restructuring program is divided into a short-
term and a complementary long-term phase. The first phase comprises
immediate measures designed to rapidly improve the'financial situation of
the cotton subsector. This would be completed by a second phase, to be
based on the results of studies carried out during the first phase, and
would consolidate the restructuring process, including diversification of
agricultural production.
3.02     The specific objectives of the Emergency Program were tot
(a) reduce Cotontchad's production costs and financial charges;
(b) improve the company's management; (c) improve productivity in the
cotton subsector. The components of the Program were set out by the
Government in a Development Policy Letter addressed to the World Bank. The
key components are:
(a) At the producer levels
(i)      HainteLrnce of cotton producer prices at the 1985/86
level for the period 1986/87 and 1987/88.
(ii)      Discontinuation of subsidips on agricultural inputs,
starting in 1987188.
(iii)      Restriction of the area under production to 75,000 ha
during the program period, with a view to limiting
production to 10,000 tons.



-5-
(b)   At Cotoatcbads levels
(i)      Reduction of the number of operational ginning pli.nts
from 18 to 5.
(ii)      Reduction of fixed costs through the sale of
nonessential assets.
(iii)      Closing of the Bangui office.
(iv)      Staff cuts.
(v)      Reorganization of cotton collection centers.
(vi)      Improvement of internal audit procedures.
(c)   At the level of the Government and the R&D lnstitutionst
Ci)      Suspension of certain of Cotontchad's tax obligations,
including the taz on fiber exports and contributions
to the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAM);
guaranteeing of Cotonchad's obligations to the Central
Bank.
(d)   At ONDR, the Chadian agricultural extension agency:
(i)      Staff cuts and improvement of staff performance.
se)   At IRCT-TCEAD, the research agency:
(i)      Introduction of new cotton varieties to increase
cotton ginning output.
(f)   At the Calse de Stabilisation des Priz du Coton (CSPC)s
(i)      Ensure financial autonomy, with discontinuiition of
Cotontchad's contributions, in particular for
operating costs.
4. Program desian and organization - Role of the BaLX and of Other
Donors
4.01     The Government and donors responded quickly to the cotton crisis.
cooperation among donors was good and the decision to p--spare the program
was appropriate.  The design of the Emergency Program was based on the                       D
results of two diabaostic studies financed by CCCE and the EDF,
re- ;ectively.  The two studies identified immdiate ways of reducing costs
and improving management for the subsector's institutions. Bank's
preparation of the program took only two months, appraisal was conducted
quickly in March 1986, and the program was negotiated in May 1986.
4.02     Agreement was reached at a Geneva Round Table Meeting that the
cotton program would be prepared in two phases. The first phase, the
Emergency Program, was to enable Cotontchad to "ride out' the crisis, via



immdiate measures to reduce its production costs and improve its
management and accounting. This first phase covers the period 1986/87-
1937/88. Preppration of a second phase, medium-term restructuring program
for the cotton sector, as well as any amendments to the Elergency Program
were to be based on a study financed by UNDP and executed by the Bank.
4.03.    The Director of Cotontchad was responsible for start-up, assisted
by a Program Coordination Unit (UCP) headed by a management control espert.
The purpose and operational procedures of the UCP were discussed and
approved with the government at the time of the credit negotiations. The
UCP was entrusted with handling the technlcal monitoring of program
implementation, while for the extension (ONDR) and research (IRCT) agencies
which are independent of Cotontchad, the general manager of the Ministry of
Agriculture was designated. The Comitd de Reflexion served as the liaison
between donors and the Office of the President of the Republic for matters
related to program implementation. Bi-annual meetings were also crganized
between donors and the Comite.
4.04     The total project cost was $47 million, of which $15 million was
to be provided by IDA, the balance to be furnished by the Caisse Centrale
(CCCE) for $15.6 million, and in grants from the European Development Fund
(EDF) for $13.7 million), the French (FAC) for $0.8 million, and the
Netherlands for $2.3 million. The IDA credit was to be released in two
tranches, one of $10 million and one of $5 million. The first tranche was
to be released upon program start-up, and the second following a midway
evaluation of the program, designed to confirm that the following measures
had been finalizeds (a) audit of Cotontchad for fiscal 1985186; (b)
adoption and promulgation of a decree abolishing input subsidies; (c)
reduction of the number of operational ginning plants; (d) reorganization
of Cotontchad's financial and accounting operations; (e) settlement of
Cotontchad's arrears.
4.05     The funds furnished by IDA were intended to finance (a) the
agricultural inputs program for the cotton subsector; (b) activities
designed to improve Cotontchad's management, including management control,
mainly through internal audits and technical assistance, training, and
studies in preparation for the secoud phase of the restructuring program;
(c) activities linked to the continuation and recrganization of the
operations of key institutions in the cotton subsector, in particular ONDR
and IRCT.
5. P_ sram Im lementation
5.01     The credit was signed on July 18, 1986 and actual effectiveness
was in October 1986, after the Chadian Government had complied with the
required conditions. The principal aim of the Program - to identify
measures to be taken immediately to improve Cotontchad"s financial
situation - wAs successfully implemented and owed much to the able
assistance of the UCP. In addition, the commitment of the top-level
Chadian authorities to monitor the program was effective, including their



- 5 -
readiness to act; for example, the government moved quickly to bring about
changes in Cotontchad's management and in the leadership of the Committee
when difficulties started to appear in the program's implementation.
Howevex, in practice the Hinistry of Agriculture played a minor role in
part b*eaA&i all IDA funding went directly to Cotontchad. This explains
perhaps the leis-than-satisfactory performance of ONDR in program
implementation.
5.02     The risks of poor proiect execution were, on the who.le, well
evaluated at the time of project preparation. Actual world prices of
cotton fiber were well above the program's conservative estimates, and
measures which were politically too sensitive were excluded from the
program. For instance, becauge the program was designed at a time when
Chad's political situation was still very fragile, donors had accepted the
Government's position that it was not politically feasible to include in
the cotton program a reduction in the producer price, although this measure
was economically sound.
5.03     At the prod,_at level, cotton prices were frozen at their 1985/86
levels and subsidies on inputs were eliminated starting with the 1987/88
season. The danger of farmers losing interest in cotton growing was warded
off by the absence of alternative crops; however, the ceiling of cotton
production to 100,000 tons - because variable costs of fiber were above
world prices - resulted in a rationing of inputs which proved difficult to
implement. The production target of 100,000 tons was not only surpassed
during the 1987,38 season, but the geographical distribution of cotton
production was influenced by political factors rather than efficiency.
5.04     At the Government level, the suspension of Cotontchad's tax
obligations during the program was fully adhered to, and th? political
consequences of adjustment (firing of personnel) were counteracted by the
authorities' realization that the economic and social costs of proceeding
wlthout adjustment would be even higher. Lastly, the trend in cotton
export prices was more favorable than expected, a reflection of the fact
that the estimates were somewhat conservative.
5.05     At Cotoutchad level, program execution was good, and the cost
reduction measures were implemented, including tlxe reduction of the
company's non-essential assets and overheads, substantial staff cutbacks,
etc. However, for Cotontchad's management, measures introduced were not as
thorough and synergic as was hoped. A piecemept approach s.o management was
inadequately used when an integt:ated approach would have led to
implementation of more thorouG,h measures. It seems that implementation of
the Bank's proposal to undertake a management audit would have given a
preview of the magnitude of Cotontchad's management problems. In
retrospect, it appears that the Bank should have stood firmer on the
management audit of Cotontchad, despite the aversion of both Cotontchad and
CCCE to it.
5 06     For extension, ONDR did not appear to be at all effective in the
field. The Bank recognized early that this Was the weakest element of the
sub-sector, but identifying solutions to its problems was difficult to
undertake in the short-term. Thus, it appears that the program preparation
timetable was too tight," and also emphasis was put on financial issues



-6-
and on immediate rescue measures. Insufficient attention was paid to some
technical issues e.g. high costs of farm inputs, ineffective extension
services, as well as organizational ones such as the overlapping
responsibilities b.tween Cotontchad and ONDR. In addition, the second
phase study which started in April 1986 when the Emergency Program was
being finalized appears to have been launched too early; few new ideas for
a medium-term program were generated as the basic political constraints
remained the same, and little new information was available.
5.07     Procur e nt and disbursement took place in conformity with the
World Bank's guideline. Initially, Cotontchad had wanted to avoid using
Bank procedures, and had had difficulties in applying them correctly. But
those difficulties were subsequently overcome, thanks to the skill of the
Program Coordinator, to the rapidly-created Bid Evaluation Committee, and
also to a World Bank mission which, right from the effective date, had
helped Cotontchad to prepare all of the tidding documentation.
Disbursement of the second tranche too'v longer than planned with nineteen
months after effectiveness instead of nine. But this stemmed from the fact
that in tte course of the Program, the Dutch Government decided to provide
additional financing for agricultural inputs, making the release of the
tranche less urgent although release conditions were met. Nevertheless,
following a reallocation of the credit funds, the credit was fully
committed by the closing date. Total program cost was $60 million of which
$43.2 million were provided by the other co-financiers, against appraisal
estimates of $47.4 million. This actual cost of the program represents an
increase by 26? over appraisal estimates. This is due first to increases
in the parity of SDR vis-a-vis the US Dollar - IDA contribution increased
by 12Z from $15 million to $16.8 million - and in the parity of other
European curre6cies such as the French Franc and the ECU vis-a-vis the US
Dollar. In addition, some changes in the respective contributions of other
cofinanciers took place. EEC contribution in French Francs was increased
by as much as 25 due to larger than expected STABEX funds and French
contribution (CCCE and FAC) in US Dollar equivalent was slightly increased.
6. Pro8ram Results
6.01     Cotontchad's production costs declined quite spectacularly, with
the production costs of fiber falling from CFAF972 per kg in 1985186 to
CFAF610 per kg ln 1986/87, and to CFAF495 per kg in 1987/88. Cotontchad's
negative cash flow, estimated by the program at CFAF4.6 billion for
1987/88, was CFAF1.8 billion, a deficit 2.5 times lower than the program
estimates. In addition, Cotontchad implemented the recommendation to
purchase farm inputs via bids. This provided important savings to farmers
as the cost of such inputs decreased sensibly. It should be noted,
however, that market prices for cotton rose more favorably than
anticipated, contributing significantly to Cotontchadts financial
situation.
6.02     Another positive, but non-quantifiable, consequence of the program
was that Cotontchad came to realize the importance of keeping a close check
on production costs and on improving management. Those two objectives now

form an integral part of Cotontchad's guLdelines, and with the introduction
of tools to monitor its technical and financial parameters on a monthly
basis, Cotontchad ls pursuing the improvement of its managoeant in the
context of the second phase of the restructuring program.
6.03     The Emergency Program has succeeded less well in improving
agricultural productivity, reflecting the weakness of the eztension agency,
and also the difficulty to address the related issues in the short-term.
However, by the end of the Emergency Program, and during the early period
of the subsequent phase, important measures were introduced including,
among others, more flexible technical advice to the farmers (as opposed to
one or a few technical input packages), introduction of less expensive
insecticides, and decentralization of the decision-making process within
ONDR. Still, human resource capacity within ONDR and also in Cotontchad
remains an important constraint which will need to be addressed vigorously
in subsequent phases of the restructuring program. Technical assistance,
audits, and the Government's readiness to arrange for the creation of a
team of local experts to direct program execution clearly helped improve
efficiency within the sub-sector, but cannot be sustainable substitutes for
the low level of manpower.
6.05     The settlement of Cotontchad's arrears to the Central Bank (BEAC)
was also a thorny problem, for which a solution was not identified during
the Program's design. While the Bank supported a rescheduling of the
arrears under terms similar to IDA credits, its principal co-financier
wanted a faster repayment period, including the earmarking of a large
portion of externally mobilized resources from STABEX, the IMF, and the
Bank's special funds for Africa to pay for the arrears. An interim plan
for the settlement of arrears was agreed with the BEAC in 1986, which
rescheduled the repayment period over ten years including a five-year grace
and a two-year moratorium on interest. But it was recognized by all
parties that this rescheduling term was not satisfactory, because it
exceeded Cotontchad's and the Government's capacity to pay, and thus needed
to be renegotiated. By the end of the Program, BEAC agreed to reschedule
once more part of the arrears, while Cotontchad's arrears vis-a-vis the
commercial banks were repaid through a special credit from CCCE.
7.   Program's sustainability
7.01     The Emergency Program was designed as the first step in a broader
process of reform and institutional development. There is still much to be
done, but the political coumitment is still strong and Cotontchad appears
to have internalized the objectives of the adjustment program.  The cotton
committee continues to play an important role and donors continue to
monitor closely the follow-up program's implementation. The Program's
achievements have been sustained and the long-term objective of making the
cotton sector viable is likely to be achieved. The second phase of the
program, now in progress and supported by the Financial Rehabilitation
Credit, is designed to further develop the measures initiated during the
first phese.



7.02     It is to the Emergency Program's credit that Important constraints
of the sub-sector have been identified, e.g. the need to pursue upgrading
of Cotontchad's management, staff training, organization of the extension
services. These elements constitute important components of the subsequent
phase of the program, and which include the establishment of an
organizational system of management at Cotontchad, decentralization of
ONDR's operations in the cotton-growing region, and the preparation of test
operations in support of the farmers, to serve as a basis for an
intervention strategy. Moreover, the formulation of a producer price
policy represents an important component in the second phase, and stresses
a closer relationship between market prices of fiber and producer prices.
8. Borrower's Performance
8.01     The Government has demonstrated its commitment to the success of
the program by setting up. on schedule, a very capable Project Coordination
Unit (UCP), and also proceeding to make all necessary staff changes at the
program implementation level. Performance of the UCP was good, as
reflected in the esecution of measures foreseen. But performance at ONDR
and IRCT were limited although coordination was greatly improved between
ONDR and Cotontchad. The decision making process within the Ministry of
Agriculture and ONDR was slow but significant improvements have been
introduced in this area under the second phase.
8.02     The Cotton Committee's role was weak during the early phase of
project implementation, particularly when the report of the second phase
was ready for discussion and this seriously delayed preparation of the
second phase. However, the bi-annual meetings of Government and donors
convened by the Committee and the Minister of Planning to evaluate progress
in implementing the Program were valuable and provided a forum for the
Committee to disseminate information to the rest of the Government and to
donors not directly involved in the Program's financing. The Committee,
including the leadership character of its head, has proved to be very
instrumental in fostering coordination in the project's implementation, and
it continues to play such an important role in the current ezecution of the
follow-up program.
9.  Bank's performance
9.01     Technical assistance was efficient, particularly within the UCP.
The Bank's appraisal mission paid insufficient attention to technical and
organizational issues related to cotton production, perhaps reflecting the
lack of involvement of technical specialists knowledgeable about cotton on
the team. But as the Program's supervision unfolded, the Bank made an
important contribution to some technical issues, e.g. an analysis of
agronomic recommendations which led to the proposition and adoption of
different types of insecticides with the results of providing important
savings to farmers.
9.02     Supervision was difficult in the early period of the Program
because Cotontchad, and also the Government were totally unfamiliar with
the Bank's procedures. Important efforts were devoted to establishing
dialogue between the Government, the Central Bank, Cotontchad, and the



-
Bank; later superviuions benefitted from them. Also, coordination between
the Bank and the prlncipal co-financLer was somewhat hlndered both by the
medium-term study whlch appeared to the CCCI as a mechanLsm to "check up
on the dLagnosLi study carried out by CPDTICCCE, and by the Lisue of the
repaymeat of the arrears for wilch the Bank and the CCCE have dLfferent
views. However coordinatLon between the donors has gradually improved,
wlth joLnt supervlslon mLsLons being undertaken. Thls represents an
Lmportant legacy, as coordlnatLon among donors ln the follow-up program has
been effective.

COTTON    RGEC  PROGRAM
(CREDT 1716-cE)
PART 11:  PROJEC  REVIEW fl     B I   BOUMIEkS FPERSECTIV
1. Data Contained in Part III
The table attached hows applications of the proceeds of IDA Credit
1716-CD in ter.s of the categories contained in Aanex 1 of the Credlt
Agreement.
Without disputing the indication in Table 3 of Part III of the PCR to
the effect that the value of the SDR role 132 between appraisal and the
closing date, we would note that the value of the credit in local funds,
estimated during negotiations in May 1986 at CPAP5.4 billion, was in
practice CFAPS1. billion, a reduction of 51.
The other assistance made available to and/or consumed during the
emergency program was as follows.
-      CCCEICOTONCHAD                 CPAP  4.680 billion
-      European Commiuty                    6.110 billion
-      Netherlands                          0.722 billion
-      VAC                                  0.790 billion
2. The Analysis Contained in Part I
Part I of the report is in our opinion simultaneously succinct,
comprehensive and objective, as regards not only the essential stages of
the project but also the thought processes of the principal parties
involved.
The chronology and analysis of the facts as presented therefore
require no additions or corrections on the basic issues.
3. Evaluation of the Bank's Performace and Relations with the Borrower
Two periods may be distinguished heres up to the supervision
mission in October 1987, the borrower felt that the Bank had reservations
about the actions taken by those responsible for the cotton sector.
PurthorFore, sharp differences were clearly apparent between the positions
of the Bank and the ideas ezpreossed by the CCCL.
After the supervisLon mission in January 1988 mutual confidence
slowly increased, and better and clearly more constructive attitudes
developed among the various partners. Relations between the Bank and the
cotton sector are now excellent.
Imple entation before 1988 was not poor; simply, things were
especially hard during that period.



- 12 -
Part I of the report correctly points out that the Chadian
authorities replaced ineffective managers at the appropriate times; these
measures and similar steps tnken at the Bank may explain the satisfactory
developments referred to above.
As regards the approach to the cotton sector's problems, the Bank
irom the start took a more global (macro?) view than the majority of the
other partners, who were more concerned with the financial rescue of
COTONCHAD. The borrower would observe that the Bank was the first
institution to concern itself atbout the agricultural aspects of these
problems, thereby laying the foundations for the program contract which we
to follow.
Bank staff were always in the forefront of activities, and both
during and between supervision missions the attention given to the issues
involved resulted in a number of proposals made by the Bank being agreed
and implemented.
Nevertheless, this desire to direct events sometimes led to
proposing solutions that had been devised (and perhaps even tested) in
situations quite different from those in Chad, and thus were difficult to
apply.
4. Evaluation of the Performance of Co-financiers and Relations with the
Borrower
For reasons pertaining to the history of the situation, the CCCZ
was, like the Bank, one of the principal forces behind the emergency cotton
program.
The CCCE's approach was to promote the rescue of COTONCEAD while
also resolving the matter of the arrears to BEAC. This approach was more
in line with the concerns of the borrower.
Relationships between the Borrower and CCCE were good, helped from
the beginning by the existence of a local CCCE office much livolved in the
preparation of the emergency program.
The European Community was the main donor over the program period,
essentially through the STABEX compensatory financing arrangements. The
EEC ensured that all the STABEX financing benefitted the cotton sector
effectively, thereby showing a good grasp of the seriousness of the
financial situation and a desire to help resolve the problem.
The other resources received by the sector were the result of
bilateral agreements with Chad. These donors displayed much understanding,
flexibility and good will. A number of them, in view of the serious
situation in the sector, have even continued assistance which initially was
provided on an interim basis.



- 13 -
S. Performance of the borrower
Nominally speaking, the borrower was the State, represented by the
Ministry of Planning and Cooperation. In practice, those interacting with
the Bank were evidently more numerous, and, in addition to government
officials, the various sector representatives brought together under the
aegis of the Comit# de R6flexion et de Suivi (CRS) de la Fili4re Coton were
in periodic or even permanent contact with the Bank.
Nevertheless, what might seem a mosaic of diverging interests was
inspired by a common determin*tion tot
-     succeed without mortgaging the futures
-     respect commitments undertaken;
-     act responsibly and pragmatically.
Even if some actions occasionally deviated from this intent, the
overall results achieved were satisfactory.
The Government took the necessary measures, which were sometimes
severe, within the deadlines established and saw to it that the CRS applied
the reconmendations approved by the donors. This attitude did not by any
means rule out local contributions and initiatives, or the discussion and
even questioning of recommendations when these appeared to be of doubtful
utility.
The same spirit of cooperation and efficiency has prevailed during
the preparation and implementation of the current program contract.
6. Lessons learned
Apart, obviously, from benefitting from the rescue of the cotton
sector, COTONCHAD became aware of the advantages of the bidding competition
system for purposes of awarding significant contracts.  One of the cl6arest
examples relates to the cost of inputs made available to farmers.  While in
1985/86 the cost oz inputs was CFAF48,000 per ha (the farmer being
responsible for 50Z and CSPC for the other 50X), current production costs
are of the order of CFAF26,000 per ha, entirely paid by the farmer.  The
impact on the farmer of his gradual assumption of the entire cost of the
inputs has thus been very significantly mitigated.
The advantage of having a reliable forecasting tool was also one
of the lessons learned from this phase.
