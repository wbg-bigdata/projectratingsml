I. THE SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. Urban Development in Korea
1.01      Korea, like many other developing countries, has experienced rapid
urban growth during the past several decades. Between 1970 and 1981, the
urban population will have increased by 93% during a period when the
national population will have increased by only 20%. A trend toward smaller
household sizes has resulted in even more rapid growth in the number of
urban households - a 116% increase between 1970 and 1981. Some 5.24 million
of the country-s 8.16 million households (62.4%) are likely to be living
in urban areas by 1981. These urbanization trends are expected to continue
into the 1990s. The Korea Development Institute (KDI) projects that 75% of
the population will be living in urban areas by 1991, a level comparable to
that of most developed countries.
1.02      During the 1960s and 1970s much of the urban population growth was
concentrated in the two largest cities, Seoul and Busan. Together they
accounted for 5.7 million (58%) of the 9.8 million new urban residents added
between 1960 and 1975. Since 1975, the rate of population growth of Seoul
and Busan has slowed, with relatively more rapid growth now occurring in
medium and small cities. The government's recent decentralization policies
which emphasize industrial development in smaller and medium cities seem
certain to concentrate development pressures in a number of such cities over
the coming decade.
1.03      This rapid urbanization and growing personal incomes have put
great pressure on urban housing markets. For these reasons and in part
owing to deliberate past government policies which emphasized economic
growth at the expense of social infrastructure development, Korea has been
unable to overcome a persistent housing shortage.
B. Housing Situation in Korea
1.04      The major housing problem confronting Koreans is an acute shortage.
Nationwide, the ratio of dwelling units to households was only 76.5% in 1979,
a shortage of 1.66 million units. Moreover, this ratio has actua:Lly fallen
slightly over the last decade despite rising levels of income and
historically high levels of housing construction.

In urban areas, the situation is more severe than indicated by national
averages. In 1970 the ratio of housing units to households was only 56%,
by 1975 the ratio had fallen to 53%. The housing situation in rural areas,
however, is projected to be considerably easier, primarily as a result of
declining rural population (down 2.4 million between 1975-81). Thus, the
major housing problem of the 80-s will largely be concentrated in urban
areas.
1.05       Continuing housing shortages during a time of rapidly rising real
incomes have contributed to rapid rates of increase in rents and housing and
land prices. Housing prices rose at a rate of 20% per year over the decade
of the 70s, twice the rate at which the Consumer Price Index grew. Land
prices rose even more rapidly, at 30% per year over the decade, and still
more rapidly in the late 1970s. These trends have caused housing
expenditures to take an increasingly larger share of the budgets of urban
households and have made it difficult for many households to accumulate
enough capital to purchase houses.
1.06       Despite the continuing shortage and rising prices, average per
capita space availability has improved over the decade of the 70s. The
number of persons per room in all cities declined from 2.7 in 1970 to 2.5 in
1975; space per person increased from 1.7 py (5.6 sq m) to 2.1 py (6.9 sq m)
over the same period. The contrast between the worsening housing shortage
ratio and an improving housing space standard can be explained by two
factors: (a) the tendency of the private sector to build only large units
and (b) a significant upgrading of the existing stock.
1.07       There has been a decline in the number and proportion of
relatively small housing units while the demand has been increasing, mainly
due to the shrinking Korean family size (5.0 person/household in 1970 to an
estimated 4.5 in 1981). Between 1970 and 1975, the number of urban
dwellings smaller than 15 py decreased by about 12% (from 2.82 million to
2.47 million)-while the number smaller than 10 py decreased by about 26%
(from 1.43 million to 1.05 million). These declines are primarily
attributable to high rates of demolition (which tend to be concentrated more
among smaller units), upgrading of small units to form larger ones/l and a
focus of both the public and the private sector on building large units (of
units built between 1970 and 1975 only 24% were less than 15 py whereas 55%
of the 1970 housing stock was less than 15 py). These discrepant trends of
smaller households and larger houses seem certain to put serious pressure on
housing prices for young and low-income households.
1.08       The distributional consequences of these housing trends are
important. Housing is both a necessity and a major item in current household
budgets. Thus rising prices hit hard at the poorest urban households.
Further, housing is the single largest asset that many Koreans have or will
ever have.  Thus to be denied access to home ownership is to be denied access
/1 According to the 1975 census data, 241,000 units above 15 py were built
during 1970-75, when during the same period an estimated 275,000 were
upgraded to larger sizes. Information about upgrading activities during
1976-80 is not yet available.

to the principal vehicle for wealth accumulation.  Finally, to the extent
that above "normal" rent increases accrue to landlords as a result of housing
sector restrictions, both income and wealth inequality amay be increased.
1.09       According to MOC, the output breakdown between the public and the
private sector in terms o' units for both urban and rural housing has been
as follows:

These figures, however, are partially rmisleading since "public sector"
construction as used in Korea includes all houses built with the help of
mortgages which are only available froma public sector institutions. 1977
was a typical year when the private sector provided 76% of the resources
invested in housing (W 606.5 billion of a total of W 800 billion) but built
only 60% of the units. A detailed breakdown of public sector activities in
1977 and 1978 is given in the following table.

Congtraint8 oni the-Expansion of Housing
1.10      The three main factors which have constrai-ned the expansion of
housing in Korea are: (a) a limited mortgage finance system; (b) an
inadequate level of investment in the housing sector; and (c) the scarcity
of inexpensive urban residential land. The situation has been aggravated by
a high level of demolition of existing houses in the past and the fact that
the private sector concentrated only on large expensive units.
1.11      The limited housing finance system in Korea has prevented potential
purchasers from converting their present incomes into effective demand for
housing because no mortgages were available. In 1977, less than one-quarter
of the resources invested in the housing sector were mobilized by mortgage
loans. In fact 60% of the new units were paid for entirely by cash. The
government policies which have inhibited the flow of capital into housing
are: (a) prohibition of mortgage lending for residential real estate by
banking institutions other than the Korea Housing Bank (KHB); (b) restric-
tions on KHB lending for housing stemming from government requirements that
as much as 56% of KHB-s portfolio be held in the form of non-housing
investment; and (c) failure to develop any secondary market for mortgages,
thereby limiting KHB's ability to raise funds from institutional sources.
1.12       Overall government financial policies, which have historically
favored the industrial sectors and discouraged the development of an active
mortgage system, have kept the level of housing investment low.  For example,
housing investment during the First FYP, 1962-66, was only 1.7% of GNP; by
the Third FYP, 1972-76, investment had risen to only 3.6% of GNP. During
the Fourth FYP, 1977-81, investment is expected to have grown to approxi-
mately 5% of GNP, which will need to be raised even higher if the goals of
the Fifth Plan are to be met./I
1.13      The aggressive promotion of construction exports may have reduced
the incentives for domestic home building, but government policies now
appear to be shifting to a more balanced view.   Although price increases
and some building material shortages have occassionally been noted, the
ability of the housing construction industry to increase output by 50% in
one recent year period (1977/78) argues that there will be adequate capacity
in the construction industry for the housing sector.
1.14      The status of land available in residential areas is a major
source of concern for rapid provision of housing, particularly by the public
sector which must compete for high cost, scarce open areas. In 1978 about
7,674 sq/km or 7.8% of total land in Korea was designated as urban areas
which included residential, commercial, industrial and green belt zones. Of
that, only 11.9% was zoned as residential and nearly 80% was classified as
/1  Raymond J. Struyk estimates resource needs to meet the goal of 9 units
for 10 households by 1991 will require 5-10% of GNP depending on the
type and size of houses built, as stated in his paper Hdnlitig itYKorea½
Fifth -Five-Year Plan:  Possibilities and Con5ttgincs, The Urban
Institute, 1980.



green belt zones with severe restrictions on their use.  Tn 1977, according
to MOC, nearly 41% of the residential area in urban areas remained undevel-
oped.  The situation in the major cities (Seoul, Busan, Daegu) and satellite
cities of Seoul is worse where only 36% and 31%, respectively, of the total
residential area is undeveloped. In the major cities the problem is further
complicated by the relative scarcity of large areas of more than 1,000 py
which can be efficiently developed as housing estates.  It is projected that
an absolute shortage of developable residential land may occur within the
time of the Fifth FYP. The Korea Land Development Corporation (KLDC) has
identified nationwide about 1,800 developable parcels greater than 1 ha
which together comprise about 100 million py of land, only half of which are
presently zoned residential. It is estimated that about 64 million py will
be necessary to meet the residential construction goals of the Fifth FYP,
thus creating the possibility of a severe squeeze on residential land and
thus on housing expansion possibilities.
Prospects for Demand and Supply
1.15       Over the period of the Fifth FYP, 1982-86, it will be necessary to
accommodate new urban families (280,000 per year) and replace units removed
from the stock (an additional 45,000 to 90,000 per year). Thus, 325,000 to
370,000 units per year will be required to keep the situation from worsen-
ing. Any improvement will therefore require building at a rate signifi-
cantly above the highest yearly output of 300,000 units achieved in 1978.
The new housing "Master Plan" (para 1.26) estimates that nearly 5 million
housing units will have to be constructed during the next 10 years to reach
the target of 90% supply ratio by 1991.
1.16      Effective demand, however, requires additionally that households
have both the willingness to spend on more housing and the ability to
mobilize the required resources. Demand is primarily dependent upon the
growth of income and the price of housing.  For the latter, there is
evidence that the rate of price increase for land and housing have slowed
appreciably during 1980.  As the housing shortage is reduced, it is
reasonable to expect the relative rate of inflation for housing to be lower
than in the past particularly if more land is made available for housing and
if financial sector reforms create investments which are attractive
alternatives to real estate speculation.
1.17      Real income growth has been stagnant for the past year and a half
in Korea but is expected to resume in 1981. Although recent econometric
work on the income elasticity of demand for housing has not proven
satisfactory,/1 the available analysis of household expenditure data
indicates that many families could repay a mortgage if one were available,
at approximately their current housing costs. This fact in the context of
the general housing shortage in Korea should assure strong demand for at
least the next plan period.,
/1 Struyk, Raymond J. op. cit.

1.18      The prospect for supply depends, then, on government's overall
investment target for housing, incentives in the construction industry, the
supply of serviced land and the availabiity of resources in both the public
and private sectors.  The most recently announced housing policies directly
address each of the significant supply constraints (paras. 1.26-1.28).
C. Recent Government Policies in the Housing Sector
1.19      Until the end of the First FYP (1962-66), there was no formal
housing policy in Korea. During the Second FYP (1967-71), the Korea Housing
Bank (KHB) was established and the Korea National Housing Corporation (KNHC)
was upgraded with a revised mandate and increased capitalization. This
period, however, was marked by an intensive slum and illegal housing
clearance program in Seoul. On the financial side, regulations placed on
KHB made it rather unattractive to depositors. Also, during this period
KNHC concentrated on large and fairly expensive housing units in its first
projects, introducing the concept of apartment buildings to Korea targeted
mainly at the high-income groups in Seoul.
1.20      The Third FYP (1972-76) constituted the beginning of a more
systematic and better organized effort to deal with housing. For the first
time, a formal 10-year (1972-81) housing plan was announced by the
government. The 1972 Housing Construction Promotion Law (No. 2409) was
enacted which set out the institutional framework for planning, policy
formulation and implementation of the housing plan.  This law is still the
basic framework for housing policy and stipulates that: (a) MOC is responsible
for formulating long-term plans as well as annual implementation guidelines
and for coordination with other public agencies through the National Housing
Policy Deliberation Committee; (b) the National Housing Fund, administered
through KHB, is to be used for public, low-cost, low-income housing with the
allocation of housing units decided by MOC and the lending terms regulated by
MOF; (c) preference is to be given to housing projects in the disposition of
publicly-owned land; and (d) MOC will regulate housing standards and quality
of construction materials as well as license construction firms.
1.21      By the end of 1974, it had become clear that the resources available
from the National Housing Fund were not commensurate with the 10-year housing
plan targets set by MOC for the public sector. A new MOC plan was formulated
and made public in 1975 but was not formally incorporated in the then forth-
coming Fourth FYP (1977-81). The needs of low-income households were empha-
sized and a series of public measures to improve housing institutions and the
financing of public housing proposed. Still the MOC plan had shortcomings:
(a) it perpetuated the confusion between low-cost housing (efficiently
produced) and low-income housing (affordable by low-income households); (b)
it ignored the needs of the private sector and dealt almost exclusively with
the activities of the public sector; and (c) it was extremely weak concerning
its recommendations on housing finance policies.  The Fourth FYP discussed
issues of housing finance in more realistic terms and indicated a willingness
on the part of the government to increase the mobilization of domestic and
international resources for this purpose. Unfortunately, the investment
targets of the Fourth Plan were inadequate to build the number of units
indicated in the government-s stated objectives and implied a level of real
resource allocation to the sector below that realized under the Third FYP.



1.22      The high rate of demolition of existing units during the 1970's is
in part responsible for the persistant housing shortage despite favorable
trends in production and investment. For example, while about 1,105,000 new
units were built from 1975 through 1979, the net increase in the housing
stock was only 682,000, indicating that 423,000 units (9% of the 1975 stock)
had been removed over that period. Most recent housing demolitions have
mainly been in rural areas in conjunction with the new community (Saemaul)
program./l Demolitions in urban areas, once at a high level as part of
explicit slum clearance activities, have decreased greatly due to new
policies of the government which emphasize maintaining the existing stock.
1.23      In 1977, reforms were undertaken in order to rationalize public
sector lending for housing. The overall objectives were to promote the
development of a mortgage market with more consistent practices and to
increase the resources available to public lending agencies.
1.24      On the demand side, measures were taken to improve access to
financing for lower and medium-income households. Increased attention was
paid to the relative size distribution of newly-built housing in order to
limit the construction of larger luxury units. Increasingly effective taxa-
tion measures for capital gains were devised in order to prevent speculative
sale and resale of new units over very short periods of time.
1.25      The problem of housing supply, however, continued to be severe and
during 1979 and early 1980 government began to focus on specific measures to
increase output of both the public and the private sector. During discus-
sions with the Bank in February and March of 1980 concerning an emergent
10-year MOC/EPB plan, it appeared that the government was moving toward
specifying an explicit set of quantitative goals concerning (1) investment in
housing relative to GNP, (2) unit sizes, (3) dwelling types, (4) urban/rural
mix and (5) public/private sector activities. In addition, a number of
specific policy elements were under discussion which dealt with mobilizing
investment in the housing sector (principally through financial sector
reform), directing existing housing sector resources to address the needs of
those with relatively more acute housing problems (particulary low-income,
urban households), and improving the cost-effectiveness of supply-side
activities (e.g., by upgrading the existing housing stock, avoiding
unnecessary demolitions and improving the productivity of construction).
1.26      Political events during the spring of 1980 led to the abandonment
of attempts to further crystallize the MOC/EPB 10-year plan. Subsequently,
a "Master Plan for Public Housing Construction and National Urban Land
/1 In 1979, about 97,400 units were removed from the stock. These were
classified by MOC into the following categories:
"Improvement of agricultural housing"   63,670
"Renewal"                                  6,430
"Illegal building removal"                  7,030
"Disaster loss"                             4,510
"Industrial site construction"                790
"Urban project, etc."                     15,000

Development" was released in October 1980, endorsed by the President of
Korea, and is now the focus of a high level committee charged with
developing a plan for its implementation. Major elements of the plan draw
heavily on the aborted 10-year plan but extend them in several ways.Jl
1.27      Major elements of the new Master Plan include quantitative goals
for increasing housing production and investment, the latter set initiatlly
at 6% of GNP; an expanded role for the public sector, especially KLDC, KNHC
and a reconstituted KHB; an emphasis on small unit housing construction,
with 60% of public sector units proposed to be 10 py or smaller; measures to
reduce housing costs through increasing productivity, relying on cross-
subsidization schemes such as those employed in the Secondary Cities
Regional Project (1070-KO), and large-scale land development to provide
serviced land to low and middle-income families at affordable prices;
financial and fiscal reform to increase the supply of funds to the housing
sector and to provide incentives for builders, developers and end users of
housing; and measures to enhance security of tenure among renters. Further,
the Plan sets out a rudimentary program for low-income housing site
purchasing and development which involves measures to stabilize land prices
and shorten expropriation periods and which outlines compensation principles
for land taking, a yearly public authority land purchasing program, and
procedures for cost-sharing and coordination in development among major
participants.
1.28      The new Master Plan should be seen as a significant step forward
for Korean housing policy. Its major directions are consistent with many of
the positions taken by the Bank during five years of housing policy discus-
sions with the Korean government. While questions may legitimately be
raised concerning certain aspects of the Plan and concerning the
Government-s ability to fully implement it, the Plan provides a far sounder
framework for a continuing housing policy dialogue than has heretofore
existed. The proposed project encompasses several of the policies
incorporated in the new housing plan. In addition, agreement was reached
during negotiations that the Government and the Bank would continue to
exchange views on the formulation and implementation of housing sector
policies and plans and periodically review progress towards achieving
housing goals. The technical assistance component includes a housing
sector study (para. 2.17).
D. Housing Sector Institutions
1.29      The Ministry of Construction (MOC) through its Housing Bureau and
the Econ6inid-Planning Board (EPB) are responsible for the formulation of
national housing policy and plans which provide guidance to the Korea
National Housing Corporation (KNHC), the Korea Housing Bank (KHB) and the
Korea Land Development Corporation (KLDC).
/t The Master Plan and other recent housing developments are discussed
in greater detail in a Housing Sector Study report prepared by S. K.
Mayo (Consultant).

1.30      The Korea National Housing Corporation (KNHC), established in 1962
is a government-owned corporation whose purpose is to supply, finance,
improve and manage housing to help reduce the housing shortage in Korea.
KNHC operates under the direction of MOC which supervises its operations in
consultation with the Ministry of Finance (MOF).
1.31      The Korea Housing Bank (KHB), established in 1967, is the major
institution which mobilizes savings and is the principal government agency
for extending housing loans to house purchasers. Other than the Citizen s
National Bank, which operates a limited mortgage program, KHB housirng loans
are extended mainly through KNHC, municipal governments and agricultural
cooperatives.
1.32      Despite rapid recent growth in deposits, long-term mortgage funds
provided by KHB continue to be a minority of funds invested in housing.
Between 1975 and 1978, long-term loans partially financed no more than 28% of
newly built units in any year. In 1979, a historical high was reached when
35% of new units were partially financed by loans through KHB. Currently,
KHB is holding over 400,000 mortgages.
1.33      The Korea Land Development Corporation (KLDC) is a government-owned
corporation, established in March 1979 as a result of the dissolution and
restructuring of the Korea Land Bank (KLB). KLDC-s mandate is to improve
urban development policies rather than the more narrow goal of its predecessor
(KLB) of divesting private firms of excess land. KLDC's major activities
consist of acquiring land suitable for development and the sale of land for
residential and industrial use. In addition, KLDC has a mandate to shape and
carry out government policies on land reclamation, as well as new town and
new city development projects. The major near-term priority for KLDC is the
development of residential land for low-income groups.
E. Project Rationale
1.34     The Bank has conducted a dialogue for over five years with the
Korean government on a possible urban housing loan. Although a number of
Bank preparation missions visited Korea between 1975 and 1977, a project did
not materialize because of fundamental differences on physical standards and
the scope of a possible project. This project has now become possible due to
changing conditions in Korea and the experience gained through the two Bank-
supported regional development projects /1 in the Gwangju region, which have
substantial housing components. Together, the two loans will have financed
approximately five thousand 9, 10 and 12 py expandable core houses and
introduced the idea of internal cross-subsidies to make the units affordable
to families with lower incomes than had previously been possible in Korea.
The first project demonstrated the acceptability of the core house solution
/1  Secondary Cities Regional Project (Loan 1070-KO), approved in 1975 and
recently completed; a project completion report is being prepared and
will be issued in June 1981. Second Gwangju Regional Project
(Loan 1758-KO), approved in 1979.

which is suitable for medium-sized provincial cities where land constraints
are not so severe.  The solution provides a small but traditional house at an
affordable price with provisions for future expansion as family income grows.
Also, the cross-subsidization scheme worked well under this project
(para. 2.03).
1.35      This project is one component in the Government's development
strategy where increased emphasis is being placed on projects which serve to
expand the benefits of growth, both geographically throughout the country
and vertically to income groups which have fallen behind in obtaining some
of the basic amenities such as housing. Specifically, this loan supports
Korean government activities designed to alleviate this high priority,
social and economic problem and is one strand, along with proposed urban
transportation, regional development and water supply projects, of the
Bank's support for assisting the low-income urban families in Korea.
II. PROJECT COMPONENTS, COSTS AND FINANCING
A. The Project
2.01      In pursuit of the overall objective of formulation and implementa-
tion of appropriate housing policies, the proposed project has three primary
objectives:
(a)  to enable the Korea Land Development Corporation (KLDC) to develop
the capability to provide serviced residential sites on a large
scale;
(b)  to provide housing affordable by households in the second quartile
of the urban income distribution through the Korea National
Housing Corporation (KNHC); and
(c)  to establish a framework for project identification, preparation,
appraisal and implementation through which the Bank could support
future projects on a programmatic basis.

B.  Detailed -eatures
2.03      The project is based largely on experience gained through the
housing components in the two Gwangju regional projects. The project would
provide affordable housing for low-income families and serviced land for
middle-income families in 10 medium-sized cities, geographically scattered
throughout the country (Map 15374LR).  The development of each site would



- 12 -
involve: (a) acquisition through City Planning Law (CPL) or Land
Readjustment (LR), servicing and marketing of land by KLDC; (b) construction
of housing (expandable core, row houses and walk-up apartments) by KNHC; and
(c) provision of commercial and community facilities by local and central
government agencies. At each site, nearly 50% of the net residential area
will be earmarked for the low-income households, defined as those at about
the second quartile of the urban household income distribution, and will be
sold by KLDC to KNHC. KLDC will market the remaining land as serviced
residential plots designed for the middle-income populace. The profit
gained through the sale of open plots will be utilized to lower the sales
price of the low-income plots./l A summary of project location and scale is
given in the following table:

2.04      The project cities were selected jointly by MOC, KLDC and KNHC
based on city size, housing shortage/demand, availability of land and
willingness of the local governments to participate in the projects (para.
4.01). Seoul and Busan are not included in the project, because the

government is giving higher priority to secondary cities.  Site selection
has been based on site specific studies of the estimated cost of land
acquisition and development, accessibility to centers of employment,
conformity to city master plans and zoning, minimizing demolition of
existing structures (especially residential) and affordability of low-income
housing. The potential for residential and commercial lot sales (to be sold
at market prices) to cross-subsidize serviced land for low-income housing
was also considered. The criteria for selecting the project locations
and developing site plans is outlined in Chapter IV.
2.05      In order to facilitate its preparation, the project is structured
in two phases. Initial project preparation and Bank review focused on four
typical sites, called Phase I, to formulate the planning criteria and design
standards which are to be used for other sites as well.  Phase I consists of
sites in Changwon, Yeochan, Pohang and Gunsan, in total providing about 4,100
dwellings for low-income families and serviced lots for 1,200 middle-income
houses. A brief description of Phase I cities is given in Annex 1. Phase
II, which will follow Phase I by 6-12 months, consists of six further sites,
expected to provide more than 6,000 housing lots including about 4,400
low-income dwelling units. Locations of the Phase II components were
finalized during loan negotiations. Feasibility studies have been completed
on all proposed Phase II sites sufficient to permit meaningful cost esti-
mates to be developed. Detailed designs for Phase I and some of Phase II
sites have been completed.
2.06      Three of the four Phase I sites will be developed by KLDC in
several stages and only the first stage at these locations is being financed
through the project. At these three sites, the subsequent phases will be
developed in a similar manner by KLDC at a later time. The off-site infra-
structure being designed takes into account future developments. At several
sites, the access road and water supply are a part of the regional infra-
structure improvements planned by the local governments. In such cases,
the project includes the off-site infrastructure, but roads will be paved
only to widths essential to meet the needs of the housing sites, with pro-
visions for future expansion.  In accordance with prevailing practice, the
off-site infrastructure will be handed over to the respective city
governments upon completion of the projects. The city governments will pro-
vide for the portion of off-site infrastructure cost which is not charged
and recovered through the project.
Larid Development
2.07      Two methods of land development will be used under this project:
City Planning Law (CPL) and Land Readjustment Project Law (LR). CPL is the
conventional method involving outright purchase of land for development by a
public authority. Land readjustment,/l on the other hand, is a mechanism
for land development practiced mainly in Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia,
whereby the public authority develops the land in partnership with the land
/| Further details on the mechanics of the land readjustment process, and
its economics relative to the CPL alternative, are presented in Annex 2.



- 14 -
owners. Under LR, a site with many owners is first declared a readjustment
area. The executing agency then prepares a subdivision plan, obtains the
approval of the participants, installs basic infrastructure and sells a
portion of the site at market prices to recoup all development and
management costs. The remainder of the site is returned as serviced plots
to the owners in proportion to thle value of their original holdings.
2.08      In Korea the land returned to owners has varied from about 80%
during the formative years of LR implementation (1966-76) to 50% or even 45%
during recent years. The willingness of land owners to accept smaller
percentages of returned land reflects the progressively improved standard of
infrastructure provision and the appreciation of land values in newly
developed areas. Currently in a typical LR project, land would be divided
as follows: about 25-30% for public use (roads, parks and community facili-
ties), 10-20% retained by the executing agency for market sale to recoup
development costs and 50-65% returned to the original owners. Through this
project, for the first time, land readjustment will be used to acquire
serviced residential land for low-income housing. The land reserved for
low-income housing will come in part from the portion sold to recoup
development costs and in part from the land traditionally returned to the
owners. As the land reserved for low-income housing in the initial project
is heavily drawn from the portion of the land that would otherwise be
available to recover development costs, the cost of serviced low-income land
in LR project tends to be somewhat higher than comparable CPL sites.
However, as the portion of land returned to the original owners is
successively reduced in the future, the cost of serviced low-income land
under the two systems is expected to converge.
2.09      The language of the earlier LR laws (1966 and 1971) was written in
the context of the public agency retaining only enough land from owners to
recover infrastructure investments. Changes made to the law in 1975 and
1980 resulted in new powers to MOC to retain more land for public uses than
required to recover development and administration costs.  This will be
achieved for the first titne through this project. Consequently, KLDC would
like to gradually decrease the share of the original owners to avoid
possible political and social problems.
2.10      Although CPL may provide somewhat cneaper developed land than LR,
KLDC is reluctant to apply it on a large scale because it is unpopular with
land owners and local officials. There is a strong preference on the part
of land owners for LR over CPL, because they are able to retain a portion of
their land, the value of which has increased due to the provision of
services. LR projects are also attractive to an implementing agency like
KLDC because (a) no upfront money is required for land purchase, resulting
in an improved cash flow position and (b) the project impact is wider
because -more serviced land is provided for the same level of investment.
2.11      During the appraisal mission, KLDC and MOC agreed to undertake the
following measures which would enhance the viability of LR projects:
(a) KLDC would gradually increase the proportion of "retained land" in
future projects such that LR projects become comparable with CPL
projects in terms of the cost of retained land;



- 15 -
(b) the minimum size of lots in the returned land would be reduced to
27 py instead of 60 py, which is the current practice. This would
benefit a larger number of original small land owners; and
(c) where necessary, KLDC would buy additional land within the
scheme so as to increase the size of area developed for low-income
housing to at least 13% of the gross area.
KLDC has also agreed to monitor and evaluate the LR projects, particularly
the project's impact on the original land owners. The above measures were
confirmed during loan negotiations.
2.12      KLDCGs original proposal called for 5 of the 6 Phase II sites to
be developed through LR. The appraisal mission suggested a more balanced
mix (3:3) between LR and CPL, given that KLDC has limited experience in LR
projects, which are administratively cumbersome. KLDC has agreed to replace
one of the LR projects in the second phase with a CPL project. The project
now has a 5:5 mix between CPL and LR, which was agreed during negotiations.
2.13      The CPL sites would be fully serviced with paved roads, drainage
and water supply. Traditionally, the level of services provided under LR
projects has been significantly lower than that of CPL. Sites developed
through the LR method in this project will be provided with the main water
supply and drainage networks but roads will not be paved, except for
principal arterial streets through the site which will initially be paved
for 7 m width, though designed for future widths of 10 m or more. Only the
low-income residential areas in LR schemes will be fully serviced to levels
comparable to CPL. The cost of this additional infrastructure, termed as
second stage development, will be recovered through the land sales and will
not be borne by the site as a whole. In most LR projects the water supply
mains, and in a few cases the secondary network, will be funded by the city
governments and recovered through user charges. Electric power and
telephone service will be provided by the respective national agencies
concerned and will also be recovered directly through user charges. All
project sites will provide space for commercial areas and community
facilities such as schools, homes for the elderly, community centers,
kindergartens and parks, to be constructed and operated by private
institutions and local government agencies.
2.14      Proposed land uses for the Phase I sites are presented in Annex 3;
details of the corresponding site development works are summarized in
Annex 4. Similar data regarding the sites tentatively chosen for Phase II
projects is outlined in Annex 5. Site layouts for a typical CPL project
(Pohang) and an LR project (Gunsan) are presented in Maps 15374R and 15375R.
Housing Construction
2.15      Following acquisition, subdivision and servicing of land by KLDC,
about 50% o'f the net residential land will be sold to KNHC, which will
construct and market a mix of three types of low-income dwellings: single-
story core houses and two-story row houses (both types designed for future
expansion by the occupants) and 5-story walk-up apartments. The attached

The above distribution is intended as an overall target for the project. It
is proposed that the above guidelines be applicable to each phase of the
project and that within that program the implementing agency will have the
flexibility to vary the proportion of each type of housing, taking into
account local conditions.
Public Facilities
2.16      The project sites would require a number of facilities and
services which are not included in the KLDC or KNHC components such as:
schools, markets, police stations, post offices and off-site electricity and
telephone services. A summary of these facilities required along with
estimated costs for each site is given in Annex 7, Table 5. These
facilities will be provided and financed by respective local/central
government agencies or companies such as Korea Electricity Company (KECO).
Generally, these services have been provided in a timely manner in Korea.
Assurances were obtained during loan negotiations that these facilities
and services will be provided on project sites in a timely manner.
Technical -Assistance
2.17      The technical assistance component of the project includes funds
for:
(a)  StAff'Tfaining.  On-the-job as well as overseas training for KLDC
and KNHC staff in the areas of real estate planning and manage-
ment, engineering, construction and finance;
(b) Advisory Services. Short-term consultant for KLDC in the areas of
physical planning, engineering, and real estate planning;



- 17 -
(c) Project Preparation. Consultancy services for feasibility studies
and detailed engineering for the second land development project
on which KLDC plans to start preparation works in mid-1981;
(d) Monitoring and Evaluation. KLDC and KNHC will undertake separate
exercises, probably through local university groups, to monitor
and evaluate the land development projects with special emphasis
on land readjustment and the housing components respectively; and
(e) Housing Sector Study. Relating to housing finance, affordability
and selected housing policy matters.
These elemnents of technical assistance are described in Annex 6.  The cost
estimates for this component are given in Annex 7, Table 6. The objectives
and scope of these technical assistance components were discussed and
agreed upon during negotiations.
C. Cost Estimates
2.18       The total project cost is estimated to be W 156.0 billion
(US$240.0 million equivalent) of which the foreign exchange element, mostly
indirect, is estimated to be 37% or about US$90.0 million. The tax element
of total project cost is estimated at US$7.7 million. Summary project cost
estimates are given in Table II-1; detailed estimates are given in Annex 7.
Project costs were estimated by KLDC staff and consultants for land
development on the basis of detailed designs for Phase I sites, preliminary
designs for Phase II sites, field investigations and appraised values of
land for CPL sites and for housing construction by KNHC staff on the basis
of sirnilar on-going programs.
2.19       All cost estimates are based on August 1980 prices and include
land acquisition, construction costs including overheads and profits, design
and supervision, management costs and physical and price contingencies.
Design and supervision costs are estimated at 5% of civil works for land
development. Physical contingencies are estimated at 10% of applicable
costs for land development and 3% for housing construction. Price
contingencies for local currency costs are based on expected increases in
construction costs of 30% in 1980, 19% in 1981, 14% in 1982 and 11% per
annum thereafter. Per Bank guidelines, corresponding rates for foreign
costs are 12.5, 9.0, 8.5 and 7.5 percent, respectively. The overall price
contingency amounts to about 33% for land development and 45% for housing
construction.
D. Financial Arrangements
2.20       The proposed Bank loan of about $90.0 million (W 58.5 billion)
will finance the project's foreign exchange requirements. The loan will be
made to the Republic of Korea, which will pass the funds on as loans to the
project agencies (KLDC and KjNHC). KLDC would provide about $48.9 million (W
31.8 billion), KNHC about $68.5 million (W 44.5 billion), local governments

about $0.7 million (W 0.5 billion) and local/central agencies about $31.9
million (W 20.7 billion). The project agencies will finance the portion of
project costs not provided by the Bank loan from their own resources or
other borrowings. KLDC is expected to raise a substantial portion of the
funds for this project through land sales and central government
contributions. A major portion of KNHCs funds will come as borrowings from
the Korea Housing Bank and down payments from prospective buyers. I)etails
concerning KLDC and KNHC's sources of funds are given in Chapter III. City
sources will come from general revenues or other borrowings. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the concerned cities will provide
their share of the funds required for off-site infrastructure and community
facilities in a timely manner. Sources of funds for the total project are
summarized in the following table:

Terms of Loans
2.21      ROK will repay the Bank loan over a 15-year period including an
initial three year grace period at the interest rate prevailing at the time
of loan approval. It is proposed that the Bank loan will be onlent to the
project agencies in accordance with normal government practice, through
subsidiary loan agreements at the same interest rate as the Bank loan to RO
plus 0.05% for handling charges for 15 years with a three-year grace period.
KLDC will bear the foreign exchange risk for its share of the loan. The



- 20 -
Government will compensate KNHC for foreign exchange losses over and above
any surpluses gained by KNHC from the interest spread on its borrowing and
lending under this project. These terms were conifirmed during loan
negotiations.
Inflatioi-anid IAthtest Rates to Beneficiartie
2.22      Despite the onset of a deep recession and negative economic
growth, Korea's rate of inflation, as measured by the GNP deflator,
accelerated from 19% in 1979 to over 30% in 1980. The government
is concerned about inflation and has taken policy measures which are
expected to reduce the rate to 19% in 1981, 14% in 1982 and 11% thereafter.
The goverment's objectives are to move to positive interest rates and to
reduce the 3-5% gap which exists between housing mortgages and other
interest rates. This process commenced during the recent adjustment of all
interest rates in Korea where housing mortgages were reduced by less than
the average of other interest rates. Mortgage interest rate policy will
also be examined in the context of the studies on the creation of a
market-oriented mortgage system for middle and upper-income buyers and
through the scheduled periodic review of performance on housing policies.
2.23      The rate of interest charged to the project beneficiaries for
housing loans will be the same as that levied by the Korea Housing Bank,
presently set at 15.5% for low-income housing construction.tI Since this
interest rate is fixed for the term of the mortgage, the onlending interest
rates are expected to be positive in real terms in the medium and long-term.
III. ORGANIZATION; MANAGEMENT AND FINANCE
A. Korea Land Development Corporation
3.01      The Korea Land Development Corporation (KLDC) is a government-
owned corporation, established on March 27, 1979 as a result of the
dissolution and restructuring of the Korea Land Bank (KLB). The latter had
been created in 1975 to acquire land held by business firms in excess of
their operating needs. The problems of coordinating land banking activities
with urban development activities led, however, to the creation of KLDC, an
organization committed to the goal of improving urban development policies.
KLDC-s major activities consist of acquiring land suitable for resale and
development and sale of land for residential and industrial use. In
addition, KLDC has a mandate to shape and carry out government policies on
land reclamation, as well as new town and new city development projects.
The major near-term priority for KLDC is the development of residential land
for low-income groups.
/I Currently the interest rates for lending by KHB are 15.5% for low-income
housing construction, defined as a house smaller than 15 py (50 sq m)
and 18% for larger units.



- 21 -
3.02       KLDC's establishment includes a president, executive vice-
president, auditor and six vice presidents and is organized into twelve
departments. In addition to the Seoul-based headquarters staff, nine branch
offices have been established which are augmented by project site offices as
needed. The organization structure is depicted in Chart 22217.
3.03       KLDC sought the Bank's assistance soon after its formulation.
Given that its staff had no experience in foreign-financed projects, early
Bank missions paid special attention to KLDCGs organizational structure. In
response to the Bank's suggestion, KLDC first established a Bank project
unit, which has recently been upgraded to a Loan Projects Department. This
department has attracted 21 professional and support staff with backgrounds
in civil engineering, urban planning, economics, finance and real estate
appraisal.
3.04       In a year and a half of operation, KLDC has been able to assemble
a professional staff of some 225 for its Seoul-based headquarters operation,
plus some 110 professionals in its six branch offices. Staff recruitment was
facilitated by the absorption of the Korea Land Bank and by KLDC being able to
pay higher salaries than standard civil services rates. Staff have, as a
result, been drawn from the private as well as the public sector.
3.05       Presently, KLDC relies heavily on local consultants for project
preparation; this role will gradually be taken over by the project
department. The role of KLDC's personnel currently consists mainly of
planning and site selection. KLDC may also use local consultants to assist
in construction supervision for this project. As its staff become trained
in this role, KLDC is expected to decrease its reliance on consultant staff.
Similarly, Bank staff input would be reduced in future projects as KLDC
staff and its consultants gain experience in Bank-financed projects.
3.06       In 1979 KLDC undertook 6 new land development projects in addition
to 2 projects that were carried over from the KLB. KLDC incurred a project
cost in 1979 of W 24.4 billion, W 22.0 billion for land acquisition and
W 2.4 billion for land development. Acquisition of lands in 1979 amounted
to about 1.7 million py, mostly for industrial development, and land
development completed amounted to about 0.1 million py during this period.
The primary measure of KLDC's performance to-date is its expenditure
performance as a percent of targeted goals. As a percent of targeted goals
in 1979 KLDC achieved about 98%, with 6 out of 8 projects reaching 100% and
the remnaining 2 at 95% and 98%, respectively.  Problems of land acquisition
were encountered in one industrial estate project, where only 37% of the
budgeted funds were spent. This was the only major shortfall in its
operations.
3.07       KLDC-s 1980 basic operating plan called for an increase in land
development to 18 projects at a total estimated cost of W 80 billion to
result in the development of 0.8 million py of residential land and 0.4 mil-
lion py of industrial land. Total costs during the year were estimated to
be W 55.8 billion for land acquisition and W 24.2 billion for development.
About W 66.2 billion, W 50.1 billion for land acquisition and W 16.1 billion
for land development, or about 83% of its targeted goal were spent.



- 22 -
Financial Structure
3.08      To date, KLDC-s sources of finance have consisted mainly of
capital contributions from the government as equity and issues of land
debentures, with some funds being provided from repayments of loans which
were taken over from the KLB. KLDC started its operations with a total
capital of W 38.9 billion, of which 51% was paid in by the government and
49% by the Korea Development Bank (KDB). In December 1979, the government
provided W 20.0 billion as a capital contribution to KLDC, increasing its
paid-in capital to W 58.9 billion. During November 1980, an additional
capital contribution of W 25 billion was approved by the government of which
W 15 billion was secured at the end of December and the remainder in January
1981. KLDC issued a total of W 3.6 billion of land debentures in 1979 for
land acquisition, which carry an interest rate of 17.1% per year with a
maturity term of two years. Although the interest rate on land debentures
is less than commercial banks interest rates on savings (22%), they are
attractive to land owners who sell their lands to KLDC because of exemption
from capital gains tax on the land transfer and exemption from income tax on
interest income. Currently, the capital gains tax varies between 30% and
75%. Land debentures would be issued to acquire already developed lands for
resale by KLDC. KLDC had planned to issue an additional W 30 billion of
land debentures for land acquisition in 1980; as of December 1980, KLDC had
achieved about 87% of this target. Should KLDC not be able to issue the
required amount of land debentures, it could obtain other short-term
financing from commercial banks.
3.09      The financial statements of KLDC as of March 27, 1979, December 31,
1979 and estimated statements as of December 31, 1980 are shown in Annex 8,
Tables 1 and 2. KLDC-s current financial position appears to be sound with
adequate net working capital. The total assets taken over from the KLB
amounted to W 41.6 billion, including land with a total acquisition value of
W 12.7 billion. Since its establishment, KLDC has acquired additional land
in 1979 at a cost of W 18.2 billion, and its total assets had increased to
W 76.3 billion at the end of 1979.  Total assets at the end of 1980 are
estimated to be about W 109.3 billion.
3.10      KLDC has been acquiring land for both development and resale.
Already developed lands acquired by KLDC are further subdivided before
resale. All costs of land and development, including interest during
construction and overheads are recovered by KLDC when the lands are sold.
Future Program and Financial Projections
3.11      KLDC-s investment program for the 5-year period 1981-85 calls for
the acquisition of 10.4 million py of land including 7.8 million py of land
for development and 2.6 million py of land for resale. About 8.6 million py
of land is projected to be developed during this period, with the main
emphasis of development on low-income /1 residential land. This program is
/1 Second quartile of income distribution.

considered to be within the implementation capacity of KLDC.  The total
capital requirements for this program would be about W 714 billion
(US$1.2 billion) in constant (August 1980) prices and about W 1,020 billion
(US$1.7 billion) in current prices. The "Master Plan" (para. 1.2) ( released
in September 1980, announced major government support for KLDC's program in
the form of substantial equity contributions. A contribution of W 60 billion
has been budgeted by the government for 1981. KLDC plans to acquire a
portion of land through the issuance of land debentures, which are to be
utilized mainly in securing lands for resale. Additional funds are
expected to be generated from KLDC-s internal resources and domestic loans.
KLDC also hopes to obtain long-term financing from foreign sources for its
program.
3.12       The proposed project, for the development of residential sites in
10 cities on 1.3 million py of land, is estimated to cost about W 53 billion
(US$80.2 million), representing approximately 20% of the budget projected for
KLDC's total operation over 1981-82.
3.13       The financial forecasts for KLDC for the period 1981-85, including
income statements, balance sheets and sources and applications of funds
statements are presented in Annex 8, Table 3-5.  The forecasts indicate that
KLDC is expected to generate surpluses on its operations from 1982 onward,
all of which will be retained towards its ongoing program. Contributions
from government amounting to about W 190 billion (US$317 million) in current
prices will be requested, which represents about 20% of the capital require-
ment for the 5-year development program. Initial discussions between KLDC
staff and senior government officials indicate commitments by govermnent of
this order are being programmed for implementation of the "Master Plan".
Government assurances to provide an adequate level of equity contributions
were obtained during negotiations. The remaining sources of financing
include land sales, foreign and domestic loans and land debentures.
B. Korea Natio1al Housing Corporation
3.14       The Korea National Housing Corporation (KNHC), established in
1962, is a government-owned corporation whose purpose is to supply, finance,
improve and manage housing to help reduce the housing shortage in Korea. It
is the national housing authority charged with implementing the country's
public housing programs. KNHC operates under the direction of MOC which
supervises its operations in consultation with the Ministry of Finance (MOF).
3.15       KNHC's headquarters staff are grouped into six operational
directorates covering 15 departments (Chart 22221). The six directors
(of planning, administration, business, architecture, construction and
development) report through the executive vice president to the president.
The executive vice president is the organizational link with the seven
branch offices. Supervision of housing construction, a key element in this
project, takes place through site construction offices that report directly
to the department of construction. The director of construction oversees
the work of the department of site development as well as the department of
construction.



- 24 
3.16      Between 1962 and 1979 KNHC built about 137,000 units including
more than 30,000 units in 1979. Construction in 1980 was about 30,100
units, nearly 15% of total housing construction. The principal target group
for KNHC has been the middle income populace in large cities. Unit sizes in
recent years have been mainly between 10 and 20 py (e.g., 92% in 1979) with
the remainder larger than 20 py. The main focus (about 60% of all units)
has been on 13-15 py apartments which are affordable at about the 40-60th
percentile of the household income distribution.
3.17      KNHC constructs units for sale as well as rental housing.  In
1980, KNHC's plan calls for 48% of units constructed to be sold immediately.
The remainder are designated as "rental housing", earmarked for households
displaced by slum clearance, urban renewal and redevelopment, victims of
fire, flood and natural disasters, homeless veterans, industrial workers and
general homeless persons. The "rental" status of these units is, however,
temporary since KNIC converts the units to sale within 1-3 years of their
occupancy, allowing the tenant these years to save toward the down payment.
KNHC also manages the housing estates, and currently this includes over
77,000 units consisting of 15,300 rental units and 61,800 sale units. KNHC
manages housing units after sales for about 3 years on average, before
turning the units over for management by the residents.
3.18      The geographical emphasis of KNHC's activities has historically
been in Seoul and Busan where, between 1962 and 1976, 62% and 7%,
respectively, of KNHC units were constructed, with the remaining 31%
distributed among smaller cities. Since 1976 KNHC's emphasis has shifted
toward smaller cities, partly as a result of general government policy
favoring decentralization; in 1978, 69% of KNHC-s units were built in 30
cities other than Seoul and Busan; in 1979, 74% were built in 38 cities
other than Seoul and Busan.
Financial Structure and Policies
3.19      Financial statements for the period 1977-79 and estimated state-
ments for 1980 are shown in Annex 8, Tables 6 and 7. Sources of financing
for KNHC include government equity contributions, national housing loan
funds, housing bonds, foreign borrowings, key money and down payments from
purchasers. As of December 1979, the government had provided about 86% and
Korea Development Bank (KDB) about 14% as capital contributions, for a total
paid-in capital of W 56.6 billion. From 1978, KNHC has paid dividends to
the government and KDB at 1% of contribution amount. Retained earnings
amounted to about W 62.5 billion at the end of 1979. KNHC issued housing
bonds only in 1978 and 1979 for maturities of 6 months, 1 or 2 years at 17%
interest rate, which have all been redeemed; KNiC has no further plans to
raise funds through any new housing bonds issues. Long-term borrowings from
KHB's National Housing Fund are currently secured at 17% for 20 years. Six
foreign loans have been made to KNHIC by USAID at terms ranging between
8 and 9.5% over 25 years, and a further loan by ADM  at 7.6% for 20 years was
approved in 1980. KNHC-s average cost of borrowed funds for 1980 is
expected to be about 15.5%.



- 25 -
3.20      In 1979 KNHC had total assets of W 399 billion including fixed
assets of W 340 billion. Project assets accounted for the largest single
item of fixed assets at W 329 billion.  These are composed of rental units
(valued at cost less depreciation) and mortgages held by KNHC. In the past
five years the total number of mortgages held by KNHC has more than doubled,
from about 47,500 to almost 109,000 as of June 1980. Collection practices
are good; arrears amounted to about 2.8% of revenues for down payments and
mortgage payments,/l 0.5% for rental fees and 1.1% for management fees.
Rentors who are frequently delinquent would jeopardize their ability to
purchase their unit, resulting in a low number of delinquent accounts. In
addition, the current system of salary bonuses every three months allows
those late to be able to make up delinquent accounts on a quarterly basis.
3.21      KNHC's operating revenues are generated from the sale of construc-
ted units, rental of housing units (both national housing projects and
foreigner apartment complexes) and commercial space, management of the hous-
ing estates and interest payments by mortgage holders.  KNHCGs rental opera-
tion has, in the past, been profitable both while the units are being rented
and when the units are converted to sale, usually 1-3 years after construc-
tion. However, in 1979 rents received from new units constructed were
sufficient to cover the carrying charges of depreciation, damages compensa-
tion, maintenance, provision for bad debts but only a portion (about 30%) of
interest charges on loans. Rents received from other rental properties were
adequate in the aggregate that year to provide KNHC an overall surplus on
this operation. As the older apartments are sold, KNHC expects to sustain a
loss on the rental properties, mainly due to the high interest charges on
loans required for their construction. KNHC estimates that any losses will
be recovered through profits when the units are sold at appraised values.
As an example, the sales prices of the rental units which were converted to
sale in 1979 were sufficient to provide KNHC a profit of 54% over its costs
for those units. In addition to the rental charge, a monthly management fee
is charged the rentors to cover KNHC-s costs of managing the estates.
3.22      For houses constructed for immediate sale, the sales prices
charged by KNHC for the housing units are adequate to recover all capital
expenditures including land, development, construction, engineering design,
supervision and inspection, administration costs, interest during
construction and other allied expenses. The sales, however, earn profit for
KNHC only to the extent that sales prices, estimated before construction is
completed, exceed actual construction and overhead costs on the pre-sold
units.  KNHC, as the public housing authority, has a policy to sell the
units it constructs at a price to recover costs (including administrative
costs) with no profit. Housing units are sold on a freehold basis typically
requiring a 60% down payment, with the remainder to be repaid over 20 years
at the prevailing interest rate as determined by the rates for lending by
the KHB. In this project, the beneficiaries will be given the opportunity
to make down payments of 35-40%, with mortgages to be repaid over 20 years.
/1 Down payments (payable in installments before purchase) have not been
separated for collection purposes from normal monthly mortgage payments



- 26 -
3.23      KNHC's policy for mortgage lending under its National Housing Fund
projects has been to on-lend funds borrowed from KHB at exactly the same
terms as its borrowed funds, capitalizing interest payments during construc-
tion in the sale price of the unit. As a result, interest and principal
payments on borrowed funds have been precisely equalled mortgage payments by
the house purchasers.  Since KNHC's mandate is to supply funds for house
purchase and collect them, earning no profit, this portion of its operation
has not been reported on its income statement. More recently, under its
foreign-financed projects, KNHC enjoys a spread on its borrowing and
on-lending terms, but due to the fact that the foreign exchange risk has
been passed on to KNHC, surpluses have been absorbed by recent exchange
losses. It has been government's position to subsidize KNHC for foreign
exchange losses above the profits earned due to the spread in interest rates
and recently for interest losses due to lags in sales. However, the deficit
in interest income resulting from these factors is projected to increase up
to 11% of KNHC's total income in 1985. As part of the Government's ongoing
review of the housing sector policies (para. 1.28), the appropriate interest
rate structure for KNHC, with a view to giving it an adequate spread between
its borrowing and lending terms to cover these losses, will be reviewed.
3.24      For its housing management operation, KNHC prepares estimates of
its expenses one year in advance, including a provision for price
escalation, and determines the appropriate management fee to be charged.
KNHC provides services (para. 6.05) until its budget is expended. In the
last few years, the fees collected were sufficient such that no problems
were encountered in providing the necessary services associated with estate
management.
3.25      KNHC prepares its budgets in accordance with the Government's Budget
and Accounting Regulation Law and KNHC's Special Law, whereby budgets are
prepared one year in advance and are dependent upon government's authori-
zation of capital and housing funds availability. KNHC recognizes the need
for better forward planning practices, and as a result of Government's
announcement of the "Master Plan", is preparing forecasts for its
implementation for the next five-year period.
3.26      KNHC's reports, particularly its income statements, do not provide
good information on its financial performance. As stated previously KNHC,
according to its accounting regulations, does not report interest income and
interest payments on its income statements. Recent lags in sales and
foreign exchange losses have resulted in a deficit on its mortgage
operations. In addition, sales income is reported for all units constructed
during a year even though this is before sales actually occur. KNHC's
financial management, pricing policies and interest rate structure will be
reviewed as part of the housing sector study included in this project.
FUtute Program
3.27      To meet the government's goal of housing construction over the next
five years as enumerated in its "Master Plan", KNHC plans to construct about
215,000 units, including 105,000 rental units which will be converted to



- 27 -
sale in 1-3 years and about 110,000 apartments, core and row houses.  This
represents an increase in units constructed of between 10-20% per year and is
considered to be within KNHC's ability to implement. The total capital
requirements for this program would be about W 2,230 billion (US$.' .7 billion)
in current prices. About 13% of the funds required would come from govern-
ment as equity contributions which would be applied toward rental housing
construction. Down payments from house purchases and rental deposits (key
money) would provide about 35% of the capital requirements with an additional
25% being provided by National Housing Funds borrowed from the KHB. The
proportion of funds provided by the various sources is in accordance with
current practice. Other sources of financing will include foreign loans.
The financial forecasts appear in Tables 6-8, Annex 8. Government assurance
to provide an adequate level of equity contributions was obtained during
loan negotiations.
3.28      The housing components of the proposed project are estimated to
cost about W 80.8 billion (US$124.3 million).  This represents a small
portion, about 9%, of KNHC's total program over 1982-83.
3.29      Recently, KNiHC has been experiencing some difficulty in selling
its units compared to earlier years when most of the units were pre--sold.
As an example, of the 19,477 housing units constructed for immediate sale in
1979, about 43% were pre-sold that year, another 49% were sold in 1980, with
the remaining 9% yet to be sold. This compares unfavorably with 1976 when
nearly 100% of the units were sold immediately and 1978 when about 80% of
the units were sold immediately. KNHC hopes sales to improve in the near
term contingent with an upturn in the economic climate. The financial
forecasts, however, have been prepared on the more pessimistic assumption
that sales will continue to lag construction./l Should sales improve, then
interest income on mortgages will increase and government interest subsidy
will decrease.
3.30      Upon examination of the balance sheet, KNHC's present working
capital position /2 appears low. However, the ratio excludes the unsold
housing units included in project assets, a substantial proportion of which
would be turned into cash on a continuous basis.
C. Project Coordination
3.31      The Housing Bureau of the Ministry of Construction will be
responsible for project coordination which will be achieved through a
working group established in early 1980. The three member working group
consists of representatives of the Housing Bureau, KLDC and KNHC. The
/1  50% of sales in year of construction, 30% the next year and 20% the
following year.
/2  As measured by the ratio of current assets/current liabilities equals
0.91.



- 28 -
Director General of the Housing Bureau will have ultimate responsibility for
coordination and project implementation. The role of each implementing
agency has been clearly defined in joint discussions with their representa-
tives and the Housing Bureau. Responsibilities for project implementation
are enumerated in Chart 22216. These arrangements were confirmed during
negotiations.
3.32      KLDC is responsible for acquiring and developing the land,
marketing the commercial and residential areas, arranging for school sites
to be turned over to relevant educational institutions and ensuring that an
adequate supply of reasonably-priced, serviced land is available for low-
income housing needs. For projects undertaken through CPL, KLDC will have
the sole responsibility for land development.
3.33      The LR projects will be jointly undertaken by KLDC and the respec-
tive city governments. The city mayor will be the legal implementing author-
ity for the project. Through an agreement with the municipality, KLDC will
undertake site planning, engineering and construction works on behalf of each
city. All dealings with original land owners will be undertaken by the city
government, including agreement on the basic development plan for the area.
3.34      KNHC will have responsibility for the construction and sale of
housing for low-income families. Lands required by KNHC for the construction
of low-income housing will be purchased from KLDC at cross-subsidized prices
and will subsequently be sold together with the core houses, row houses and
apartments that are purchased by families who meet the project's eligibility
criteria (para. 6.12). As a condition of effectiveness of the loan KLDC and
KNHC will enter into agreement concerning the terms and time of the sale of
land to KNHC by KLDC.
3.35      The role of the municipal government will be more prominent in LR
sites than CPL sites. In all sites, the municipal planning department is
responsible for adherence to and implementation of the master land use plan
for the city. In land readjustment projects, the mayor will take on the
legal and administrative responsibilities.
IV. PLANNING CRITERIA AND DESIGN STANDARDS
A.  Selection Criteria
4.01      The project cities were selected jointly by MOC, KLDC and KNHC
based on their respective criteria. KNHC-s selection criteria require that
the city population be greater than 100,000, the housing shortage ratio be
greater than 30% and the demand for the units can be established. KLDC
will, by policy, only undertake development projects in cities at the local
government's request in order to ensure active local support in implementa-
tion including budgetary support for off-site infrastructure. KNHC and
KCDC will consult on site selection and land development. Further important
project requirements affecting city selection are that the project must add
to the net housing stock of the city (relocation projects are to be



- 29 -
avoided) and that there should be no conflicts between the objectives of the
project and the community's comprehensive plan and priorities for municipal
development. Sites are also judged for effectiveness in achieving t]he
project objectives with respect to a number of other considerations such as
land availability/aquisition price, zoning, transportation and employment
linkages, infrastructure linkages, commercial/community facilities,
topographic and soil conditions and marketability.
4.02      Twenty-five different sites in 17 cities were examined during the
site selection process and feasibility studies were carried out by 5 local
consulting firms /1 on the 10 sites identified as suitable for the project.
Significant reductions in development costs, combined with improvement in
efficiency of layout, were achieved during the review of early design stages
resulting in lowered projected costs of low-income residential land. The
design features for each site are summarized in Annexes 4 and 5 and overall
planning criteria and design standards are briefly described in the
following paragraphs.
B. Site Planning and Infrastructure Design
4.03      The housing estates are designed for mixed residential development
of low and middle-income families. Sites in Phase I vary from 50,000 py to
197,000 py with the three CPL sites averaging 76,000 py (25 ha). The
proposed Phase II sites are larger, averaging 129,000 py (43 ha), due to a
higher proportion of LR projects, which inherently involve larger tracts for
a given low-income housing population, due to the need to return nearly half
the total land area to the original property owners in lieu of outright
purchase of land for the project (para. 2.07).
4.04      The proposed site plans are consistent with the overall nmaster
plan for each city and provide for future expansion. Economy in
infrastructure construction is achieved through appropriate utilization of
existing topography. The site plans are adapted to the hilly terrain to
minimize costs and maintain good views from elevated locations. Whenever
possible, cut and fill will be balanced within each site area. The general
principle of planning for the future but constructing for today's needs was
followed in designing the site layouts.
4.05       In conformance with MOC criteria, no site includes less than 2% of
the land area for parks and playgrounds; most sites abut on large tracts of
hillside and other areas designated for preservation as green belts in
comprehensive urban master plans. The portion of the site area allocated
/1 (a) Korea Engineering Consultants Corp. (5 sites), (b) Dai Ji
Engineering Consultant Corp. (2 sites), (c) Dong Yang Engineering
Consultants Corp., (d) Goryeo Engineering Consultants Corp., (e) Dong
Myeong Engineering Consultants Co.



- 30 -
for markets and commercial areas, schools, police, postal and government
administrative offices, and other community amenities varies widely (from 1%
to 8% of site area) depending on the existence of these facilities in
immediate proximity to the respective sites. Resulting saleable low-income
residential land averages about 32% in the CPL projects. In the six LR
projects, the low-income residential fraction of the net disposable land
(i.e., gross site less the portion which is returned to the original land-
owners as compensation) amounts to 28% to 41%, and is sensitive to several
aspects of final detailed site layout and infrastructure design.
4.06      A number of project sites tend to be on alluvial sediments or
coastal silt with flat to gently rolling topography. Most sites are abutted
by steep hillsides on at least one side, and some have significant
watersheds draining through the site. Grading plans have been developed to
minimize earthwork costs consistent with providing minimum site elevations
in the lower areas adequate for reasonable drainage by gravity.
Consolidation of supersaturated in-situ soft clays by improvements to soil
drainage, placing surcharge loads, and scheduling construction to allow
adequate time for subsidence, will be required in certain low-lying areas of
the coastal sites. However, all sites are judged suitable for construction
of the type involved without undue complexity or cost in foundations.
4.07      Each site includes a network of arterial and residential roadways,
integrated with the respective community's master plan for urban growth.
Local circulation is supplemented by sidewalks along the wider streets.
Road area varies from about 23%-31% of gross site area. This fraction is
somewhat high because sites are located on regional arterial roads which
service existing urban and industrial complexes, proximity to which was an
important objective in site selection. All roads to be paved will be
asphalt concrete surfaced, with total pavement, base course and sub-base
thickness varying from 35-50 cm, depending on traffic loading, frost
penetration index and other soil characteristics at the site. Width between
curbs in residential areas will be 6 m, with 8 m and 10 m width used only
for principal circulation streets. At several sites project access is an
integral part of major urban arterial roads for which right-of-way widths of
15-35 m have been provided. However, in most such cases initial paving
width is limited to 7 m with provisions for future expansion.
4.08      Water supply will be extended to each site from existing nearby
public systems, each operated by the respective city water bureau except for
the Gwangju site, which will be served by a county-operated utility. Except
for the Gwangju site, the water requirements of the sites, being a small
fraction of the existing capacity, can be met from the existing systems of
the respective municipalities. At the Gwangju site, water supply would
depend on a significant expansion of the local system, which is planned for
the immediate future; implementation of the Gwangju project will be subject
to the expansion of the Gwangsan county water system. This was confirmed
during loan negotiations.



- 31 -
4.09      The project does not involve any on-site pumping or treatment
facilities.  The system extensions are designed, allowing for peak flows, to
deliver 200 lcd, with minimum residual pressure of 20 m. The piping
network in the residential areas is sized for hydraulic demands, xcept that
the minimum pipe size used is 80 mm, for fire protection purposes.  Fire
hydrants will be provided at intervals of about 150 m.
4.10      On-site storm drainage will consist of open channels where appro-
priate, particularly for collection of hillside runoff and conveyance of
major flows through the site via improved channels of existing principal
natural watercourses, where such pass through the site. Underground
drainage pipes will be served by curb inlets at 30 m intervals. Drainage
pipes will be spun reinforced or pre-stressed concrete, depending on
economics of the particular diameter, bedded in concrete bases where
foundation conditions are poor. Trunk interceptors are designed for 10-year
storms, smaller piping for 5-year events.
4.11      All houses will have septic tanks, with effluent therefrom dis-
charged into the piped storm drainage system, except for Changwon and
Yeochan, where separate sanitary sewage collection piping is provided. The
Changwon and Yeochan project sites (and the major KLDC projects which adjoin
in both cases) are all part of comprehensively planned new towns, whiich are
being built with separate sanitary wastewater collection systems throughout.
The sanitary sewage systems proposed in the project are the best design
solutions for the respective sites. Sanitary sewerage construction at
Changwon and Yeochan sites will consist of a network of 200 mm and 250 mm
collection piping, conveying waste water to corresponding interceptors in
the contiguous KLDC-developed areas, from where it will flow into the sea.
The systems have been master planned to serve the entire new town and will
in the future incorporate treatment at the outfall prior to discharge. The
sewers are designed to provide a minimum velocity flowing full of 0.6 m/sec,
with minimum size of 200 mm.
4.12      Electric power supply distribution network will be provided by
Korea Electric Co. (KECO), the national utility furnishing these services.
Design is based on peak demand load being 4.0 kw per dwelling. KNHC will
provide street lighting on each site.
C.  Housing Unit'Design
4.13      The low-income housing units will consist of single-story semi-
detached core houses, two-story row houses and five-story walk-up
apartments. The core houses will be built on 27 py lots. The row houses
will be constructed in blocks of six units on 90 py lots utilizing 15 py of
land per unit, and the apartments will be built at an average density of one
dwelling unit per 15.3 py of land.



- 32 -
4.14      The core housing in the project consists of 8 and 10 py units,
expandable to 14 py and 16 py, respectively, in the future as the owner's
resources permit. Expansion of the basic core involves adding a room to the
initial structure, as shown schematically in the sketches (22177).  The
expandable core houses will initially consist of two rooms with traditional
ondol (under floor) heating, kitchen, toilet and a small entrance hall. The
house is designed to permit the convenient addition of a third room at a
later date. The house construction is concrete block on concrete strip
footings with timber frame roof finished with pressed slates. The coal
briquette ondol heating system is popular in Korea /1 and quite economical
at current prices for small individual homes compared to the oil heating
system. The larger homes and apartments use oil-burning, central heating
systems.
4.15      The row houses are two-story structures, each floor housing one
unit, with the upper floor expandable by enclosing a verandah. The units
are designed using cement brick cross-wall construction on concrete strip
foundations, a mixture of ondol and concrete slab floors and timber frame
roofs finished with cement roofing tiles.
4.16      The apartment units are 13 py (gross area) modules, and will be
constructed in five-story apartment blocks (the effective upper limit in
height for buildings without elevators), as is already common in other KNHC
projects. Each apartment with a net area of 10.8 py will contain three
rooms, two with ondol heating, and a kitchen, bathroom and utility room.
The construction will be a combination of reinforced concrete and concrete
block masonry. The coal briquette ondol heating system will be used.
4.17      Dwelling floor plan layouts and selection of materials emphasizes
insulation and energy conservation, necessary to minimize heating costs
through the long and severe winter common in the Korean peninsula. Exterior
wall construction will incorporate 50 mm of styrofoam insulation. Styrofoam
or rock wool, about 50 mm thick, will be used in ceilings.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Implementation Schedule
5.01      The project would be implemented over a three-year period
(1981-83). A project implementation schedule is shown in Chart 22419. KLDC
is keen to start construction on Phase I sites in April 1981 to fully
/1 Nearly 90% of homes in Korea use coal briquette ondol heating, 6% oil-
based central heating and the balance, coal briquette boiler heating
systems.



- 33 -
utilize the next construction season.  Contract documents for Phase I sites
and prequalification of contractors under ICB were completed in December
1980. Bids for land development at four sites were received in March 1981;
contracts are expected to be awarded in April. The first batch of sites are
expected to be handed over to KNHC in early 1982 for housing construction.
B. Procurement
5.02      All contracts will be awarded on the basis of international compe-
titive bidding to prequalified contractors in accordance with the Bank
guidelines. However, the local construction industry in Korea is well
advanced, and all contracts in this project are expected to be won by local
contractors. KLDC is expected to subdivide the civil works in about 10
contracts, each contract to cover land preparation and installation of
on-site and off-site infrastructure. In certain cases off-site infrastruc-
ture may be treated as a separate contract. KLDC contracts will range in
value from US$2-8 million. KNHC is likely to divide housing construction on
each site into a number of contracts (2-4) to encourage small contractors
and to permit phased construction of housing. The value of KNHC contracts
is likely to range from US$3-5 mil_ on. Both KLDC and KNHC are likely to
procure cement and steel for this project through OSROK (Office of Supply,
ROK), in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
C. Disbursements
5.03      Disbursements under the proposed loan would be made at the rate
of 46% for civil works and 100% of expenditure for technical assistance,
consultancy services, overseas training, studies and related equipment.
A separate set of disbursement categories has been set up for KLDC and KNHC
in order to facilitate use of funds by these agencies. Disbursements for
all items would be made against standard Bank documentation. It is expected
that Bank disbursements would be completed by December 31, 1984. The
estimated quarterly disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 9.
D. Accounts and Audits
5.04      Separate project accounts would be maintained by KLDC and KNHC
with respect to their project components. It was agreed during negotiations
that KLDC and KNHC will: (a) maintain separate accounting records for all
project revenues and expenditures, (b) ensure adequate and timely working
capital is provided to finance the project and (c) have the project accounts
audited annually by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank and audit
reports submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the end of each
fiscal year.



- 34 -
E. Supervision
5.05      The Bank staff input into supervision is likely to be heavy in
the first year, given that it is the first project involving a number of
agencies and includes a second phase for which the detailed designs are
being completed.  The supervision efforts during the first year will focus
on review of contract documents and contract awards for Phase I sites,
construction supervision arrangements and detailed designs for Phase II
sites. Bank staff input in project supervision is expected to be minimal
in subsequent years. It is estimated that supervision by Bank staff would
require approximately 30 staff-weeks during the first year and about 20
staff-weeks annually during subsequent years. Nearly one-third of the time
mentioned would be required in the field.
VI. COST RECOVERY AND AFFORDABILITY
A. Cost Recovery Policies and Terms of Purchase
6.01      The acquisition, subdivision, servicing and sales of land will be
carried out by KLDC in coordination with city or regional government
agencies. About 50% of the total net residential land provided through the
project will be earmarked for the low-income families and handed over to
KNHC for the construction of housing units. The primary target group for
the project will be families in the second quartile of the urban household
income distribution. Families below the second quartile will benefit from
rental space which will become available through the project.
6.02      The actual cost of land acquisition/compensation, site prepara-
tion, on-site infrastructure, housing construction, management costs,
interest during construction, design and supervision and an appropriate/l
portion of off-site infrastructure will be recovered by KLDC and KNHC from
the beneficiaries through land sales and mortgage payments. Sale of
commercial and upper income residential land at market prices will generate
profits which will be utilized to lower the sale price of the low-income
land. Housing would be provided only for the target group and would be sold
at cost with long-term mortgages. Land for public facilities will be sold
at cost to the respective agencies. Arrangements regarding the timing and
terms of sale of land by KLDC to KNHC for housing construction will be
detailed in a subsidiary loan agreement between KLDC and KNHC.
/1 That portion of the off-site infrastructure which is directly attributable
to the project site.

6.03      Mortgages will be issued upon receipt of a 35% down payment from
the low-income house purchasers with the balance to be paid over 20 years at
the prevailing KHB interest rate for low-income house purchasers, which
currently is 15.5%. Those families at or above the 40th percentile- of the
urban income distribution will be required to make 40% down payments. The
above down payments are not considered high in the Korean context, where
families typically accumulate their down payments through savings, key money
deposits, occasionally from the sale of property and contributions from
relatives which are generally not repaid. Most home buyers in Korea
typically pay cash for the full purchase price. KNHC has been selling its
units with a 50-80% down payment, with the remaining amount financed by KHB.
Even rentors are required to pay large sums of "key money" to acquire a
modest rental space.
6.04      In order to reduce the initial payment burden, KNHC offers a
graduated mortgage plan with payments increasing by a fixed amount every
year during the life of the mortgage (ranging from 7.0% increase the first
year to 3.1% the last year)./l The repayment period reflects the minimum
expected life of infrastructure and housing, and the interest rate will
correspond to the current lending rate for low-income mortgages and house
construction by the Korea Housing Bank.
6.05      In accordance with prevailing practice, infrastructure, including
roads, drains and water supply will be turned over to the respective cities
for operation and maintenance, the costs of which will be recovered through
taxes- utility and user charges. KNHC will manage the estates in the first
2-3 years and will provide or arrange to provide, among other things, for
garbage collection, security, clearance of septic tanks, cleaning of streets
and drains, street lighting and maintenance of playgrounds and other common
areas. A management fee will be levied on the basis of house size to
recover the above costs.  It has been the practice for KNHC to turn the
estates over to the occupants after a few years for self-help management and
it is expected that this practice will be followed in this project. The
residents will hire full-time staff to manage the estates who will levy the
appropriate fee. Management of the estates will not require any input by
the respective cities.
6.06      The chargeable costs of land and infrastructure development for
the four Phase I sites are summarized below:
/1 As an example, for each W 1 million of mortgage, the initial monthly
payment would be W 10,000, the fixed amount of increase each year would
be W 700 and the final monthly payment would be W 23,293.

6.08      For the case of Gunsan, and other land readjustment projects, a
second stage of development (para. 2.13) will occur on the low-income land
through which the level of servicing will become the same as the CPL sites.
The additional secondary costs will be attributable in whole to the low-income
beneficiaries. The additional costs of about W 263.7 million at Gunsan, for
example, or about W 17,130/py when added to the cross-subsidized sale price of
the land results in a total sale price of low-income land of W 61,440), which
is comparable to the sales price of the other Phase I CPL sites. The
principle for calculating the sales prices of low-income land for the Phase II
sites will be the same.
6.09      The costs of the part of off-site infrastructure not attributable
to the residents would be recovered by KLDC through future phases of
development surrounding the sites or in the case of off-site infrastructure
provided by the cities, indirectly through taxes and other user charges.
Details of off-site infrastructure and their respective recovery plans are
available in project files.
B. Affordability
6.10      The affordability calculicions are based on the assumption that
families in the target group can afford to spend about 30% of their mxionthly
income on housing, excluding utilities and taxes./l Management fees,
property taxes, electricity, heating and water charges and cooking
briquettes are estimated to represent an additional 6.5-7.5% of total
monthly income. A common practice in Korea is for more than one household
to share a house in order to afford the high housing costs. Extensive
housing surveys have confirmed this practice./2 The units being provided
under the project are being designed to provide a room suitable for renting,
which could provide an additional income to the owners. Any additional
income generated from the renting of a room by the target beneficiaries is
assumed to be already accounted for in this 30% monthly allotment for
housing.
6.11      The income distribution figures used for the analysis were based
on official data published in 1979 by EPB and projected to mid-1980
(Annex 10). Mid-1980 projected incomes were then matched with the estimated
construction costs to determine the affordability levels of the various

housing expenditure patterns by Song and Struyk, which is based
on a special housing survey that augmented the 1974 Family Income and
Expenditure survey administered by EPB.

house types, which is reflected in Table VI-1. About 35% of the units
consisting of 8 py expandable core houses and 10 py row houses provided by
the project would be affordable by households at the 22nd percentile of the
income distribution, assuming down payments of 35% and a graduated mortgage.
Another 50% of the units, 10 py expandable core houses and 13 py walk-up
apartments, would be affordable by families between the 30-35th percentile.
A fifth option, 15 py row houses, would be available for those families at
about the 40th percentile, and about 15% of the units would be of this type.

and Gunsan which are representative CPL and LR sites, respectively, in
Phase I.

6.12      In the proposed project, the screening process will consider
incomes of all household members with verifiable income sources. The
allocation criteria will define the eligible income range for the five
housing units proposed. The household income eligibility range will be the
current equivalent of W 135,000-W 165,000 per month for the 8 py core and 10
py row houses; W 175,000-W 200,000 per month for the 10 py core house and 13
py walk-up apartments, and W 200,000-W 225,000 per month for the 15 py row
houses in 1980 second quarter prices, which represent approximately 20-30,
30-40 and 40-50 percentiles, respectively, of the urban household income
distribution. Applicants incomes will be verified based upon the previous
year s documented income plus recent salary increases. In accordance with
MOCs regulations on housing supply, preference will be given to disaster
victims and those relocated from squatter areas affected by government
development projects or from land readjustment sites under this project, and
to applicants on KHB's waiting list who have been a member of one of its
savings schemes for at least six months. Criteria for allocation of housing
was agreed during negotiations.
VII. JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Economic Justification
7.01      The principal justification for the project is in terms of its
ability to ameliorate the housing shortage in the project cities, further
the government's objective of decentralizing economic activities from Seoul
and Busan, reduce upward pressure on housing prices, provide employment
opportunities in the construction sector, and strengthen institutions in
the housing sector. As indicated earlier (para. 1.04), the housing
shortage in project cities is acute. The ratio of dwelling units to house-
hold ranges from a low of 55.8% in Pohang to 83.2% in Yeochan with a median
among all project cities of about 67%. Even in cities with a comparatively
smaller housing shortage, population increases projected over the decade
have the potential to rapidly create severe shortages. The proposed
project will provide developed land equivalent to between 5.4% (in Pohang)
and 34.1% (in Cheonan) of the developed land necessary to satisfy the
housing shortage as of 1979 in project cities.
7.02      The imputed rental values of the dwellings to be constructed at
the various sites and estimated market values of the serviced commercial
and open market land were used to measure the benefits of the project.
Estimates of rental values were based on current rents charged by KNHC and
the private sector for similar housing units in the project cities.
Estimates of land values were based on market surveys conducted in 1980 by
land asessors of adjacent parcels of similar land to the sites. Land and
development, infrastructure, housing and recurrent costs were considered
in the analysis, with all taxes excluded. Shadow prices were used for
unskilled labor, but were found to have only a negligible impact on the
rates of return. Also, the rates of return were found to be insensitive to
standard conversion factors. The economic rates of return for the 10 sites
ranged from 13% to 22% and are summarized in the following table. The
weighted average rate of return for the total project (excluding technical
assistance) was found to be 16.5%.

B. Project Impact on Urban Poverty Population
7.03      An estimated 18% of households in Korean cities have incomes less
than the urban poverty threshold. While the major focus of the project is
on households between the 25th and 50th percentiles of the income distribu-
tion, benefits are expected to accrue to households below the poverty
threshold in two principal ways. First, given typical patterns of house
sharing in Korea, it is anticipated that roughly one third (6,533) house-
holds accommodated by the 19,599 housing units to be constructed in the
project areas will sublet rooms to low-income individuals and small house-
holds, most of whom will be drawn from the poverty population. Assuming,
for example, that rooms of 3 py (10 sq m) would be rented for W 16,500 per
month, households spending 30% of income for such rooms would be drawn from
the 9th percentile of the urban income distribution. Other indirect
benefits to the poverty population are expected to result from reduced
upward pressure on rents resulting from an increased housing supply. The
project is expected to satisfy a portion of the shortage of housing and
developed land in each project city, thereby creating a moderating influence
on housing prices throughout the housing market.



- 42 -
C. Project Risks
7.04      A major risk affecting the project is that construction prices may
escalate faster than incomes of the target population. The impact of
substantial cost increases on the economic rates of return is assessed
through sensitivity tests in the economic analysis. The effect of sharp
increases in construction costs would be that the housing units will not be
affordable by the families at the lower end of the target group. As an
exaimple, if construction costs of houses increase by 20% greater than the
increase in incomes, then core houses which were affordable by households at
the 22nd percentile of the urban income distribution would then be
affordable by those at the 30th percentile.
7.05      It is possible that some local governments may face difficulties
in providing their share of off-site infrastructure and other facilities.
KLDC is making special efforts to make the local governments aware of their
financial obligations before selecting the sites. Each of the city
governments participating in this project has signed an agreement with KLDC
which, inter alia, stipulates each city government's financial commitment to
the project.
7.06      For the first time in recent years, KNIIC is facing difficulties in
selling some of its units. These difficulties are attributed to the current
economic situation in the country as well as in a number of cases to site
specific conditions relating to location or low demand for the particular
type of housing. KLDC and KNHC have given special attention to marketabil-
ity in selecting project sites and scale. KNHC intends to phase construc-
tion of housing on each site to effectively meet the demand. Similarly,
KLDC would also, if necessary, sell the market land in phases. Should
market land sales fail to achieve the estimated prices, low-income families
would not correspondingly benefit from internal cross-subsidization. Given
that the land cost represents a small portion of housing sale price
(10-25%), this is not expected to have a significant effect on
affordability.
7.07      KLDC's capacity to successfully implement this project is consid-
ered to be a low risk. KLDC's current overall program is considered to be
within its implementation capacity. Even though KLDC is a relatively new
organization, it has gathered an adequate number of qualified staff. With
the help of local consultants, KLDC managed to prepare this project in a
very short period of time. Preparation of contract documents and prequali-
fication of contractors for Phase I sites liave been completed. KLDC is in
the process of hiring nearly 250 professionals next year, some of which will
be assigned to supervision of this project. Large-scale undertaking of LR
projects is likely to strain KLDC's administrative capacity. KLDC's senior
management is becoming aware of this and a reduced emphasis on LR projects
is likely in the near future.

VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on:
(a)  relative mix of CPL and LR sites in the Phase II of the project
(para. 2.12);
(b)  relative mix of type of housing to be constructed by KNHC in this
project (para. 2.15);
(c)  Objectives and scope for various elements of the technical
assistance package (para. 2.17);
(d)  terms and conditions for loans to the implementing agencies and
beneficiaries (para. 2.21);
(e)  responsibilities for project implementation (para. 3.31);
(f)  that the implementation of the Gwangju project will be subject to
the expansion of the Gwangsan county water system (para. 4.08); and
(g)  criteria for allocation of low-income housing units (para. 6.12).
8.02      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a)  the government and the Bank would continue to exchange views on
the formulation and implementation of housing sector policies and
plans and periodically review progress towards achieving housing
goals (para. 1.28);
(b)  with respect to land readjustment projects:  (i) KLDC would
gradually increase the proportion of "retained land" in future
projects such that LR project become compatible with CPL in terms
of costs of acquired land; (ii) minimum size of lots in the
returned land will be 27 py instead of 60 py, which is th,e
current practice. This would benefit a larger number of original
small landowners; and (iii) where necessary, KLDC would buy addi-
tional land within the scheme so as to increase the size of area
developed for low-income housing to at least 13% of the gross area
(para. 2.11);
(c)  that the public facilities and services required for each site
will be provided in a timely manner (para. 2.16);
(d)  the concerned city government will provide their share of cost of
off-site infrastructure in a timely manner (para. 2.20);
(e)  the Government would provide the appropriate level of equity
contributions to KLDC and KNHC (paras. 3.13 and 3.27);



- 44 -
(f) KLDC and KNHC will: (i) maintain separate accounting records for
all project revenues and expenditures, (ii) ensure adequate and
timely working capital is provided to finance the project; and
(iii) have the project accounts audited annually by an independent
auditor acceptable to the Bank and audit reports submitted to the
Bank no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year
(para. 5.04); and
(g)  as a condition of effectiveness of the loan KLDC and KNHC will
enter into an agreement concerning the terms and timing of the
sale of land to KNHC by KLDC (para. 3.34).
8.03      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$90 million
equivalent for 15 years with 9.60% interest rate and a grace period of 3
years.

NATIONAL URBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF PHASE I CITIES
Pohang
1.        Pohang is a coastal city located in the southeast part of the Korean
peninsula, north of Busan.  In 1979, its population was 194,877.  Population
growth averaged 12.5% per year between 1971 and 1975 and 11% betweeni 1976 and
1978, rates well above the national urban averages during those periods of
5.3% and 4.9% respectively. Much of this rapid population growth is
attributable to construction of a large (2,000 ha) heavy and chemical
industrial area, which is expected to continue to serve as a stimulant to
population increases over the coming decade.
2.        The population of Pohang is projected to increase by about 50% to
284,000 by 1991, which will seriously exacerbate an already serious housing
shortage unless construction is maintained at a high rate. In 1979 Pohang
had the third most serious housing shortage of major Korean cities, with a
ratio of dwelling units to households of only 55.7%, considerably below the
national urban average of about ( %.
Changwon
3.        Changwon is a rapidly growing industrial city located in the
southeastern coastal industrial belt of cities such as Masan (to which it is
immediately adjacent) Samcheonpo, Ulsan, and Busan. Population in 1979 was
124,490 having grown dramatically from 49,000 in 1976 in response to the
development of the Changwon Machinery Industrial Complex - a major
industrial estate. Industrial growth is expected to continue rapidly, with
employment projected to increase at a rate of 9.4% per year between 1979 and
1991.
4.        Population is expected to increase at an annual rate of 7.6% over
that same period (to 300,000), putting great pressure on an already tight
housing market. In 1979, the housing shortage was among the highest in
Korean cities, with a ratio of dwelling units to households of 54%.
Yeochan
5.        Yeochan is a relatively small coastal city located in the
southern part of the Korean peninsula, bordered by Yeosu to the east and
Gwangyang Bay to the north. Population in 1978 was 41,296, having
increased relatively modestly from about 35,000 in 1970. Population
increases had become relatively more rapid in the late 1970s, however,
partly in response to the development of the Yeochan Heavy Chemical
Industrial Estate along Gwangyang Bay and the central business district of
Yeocheon.



ANNEX 1
46 -                              Page 2
6.        While the housing shortage in 1978 was among the lowest of Korean
cities in 1978 (83.2 dwelling units for each 100 households), continued
development of the 4,250 ha heavy/chemical industrial estate is expected to
exert considerable pressure on the housing market during the coming decade.
At present, for example, most Yeochan industrial estate workers live in
nearby Yeosu which has a housing shortage typical of Korean cities - 64.6
dwellings per 100 households. As employment grows at the industrial
estate, population of Yeochan is expected to more than double to 106,000
by 1991, putting pressure on the housing markets of both Yeosu and
Yeochan.
Gunsan
7.        Gunsan is a western coastal city of 182,075 (in 1979) which has
experienced average growth during the 1970s. Gunsan, is however, expected
to receive major stimuli to growth during the 1980s as a result of major
industrial estate developments and an anticipated increase in trade with
the People's Republic of China, for which Gunsan would be a major
transhipment city.
8.        Projected population growth in excess of 10% during the 1980s is
expected to put pressure on a housing market which has a housing shortage
ratio typical of Korean cities - 66.4 dwellings per 100 households.

NATIONAL URBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING PROJECT
Land Readjustment in Korea
1.        Land readjustment (LR) in Korea is based upon Japanese land reform
and consolidation laws of the 1920s. Introduction in Korea of new cultivation
methods and the spread of motor vehicles and roads to serve them gave impetus
in the late 1920s and 1930s to land consolidation, rectangularization and the
straightening and widening of rights-of-way for all-weather roads. The
extension of education to rural areas and the building of district and
village administrative, health and police facilities also made new land use
demands on rural areas. Land readjustment was introduced as the mechanism by
which these new land use requirements could be met. Under LR procedures a
voluntary association of local land owners, often under the urging and
guidance of a district official acting as executor, would pool their land
holdings and by giving up to public use a small share (10-15%), each
participant would get back consolidated land usually rectangular in shape,
with access to a farm lane that connected to an all-weather rural road. Land
for schools, police stations, temple sites, etc., was also included in the
small percentage of land taken from each plotholder.
2.        The executor would first determine from the land records the number
and size of each owner's holdings and then would draw up a replotting scheme
to present to the land owners for their approval. Land owners were given
back plots equal in area to 85-90% of their original holdings.  The executor,
through negotiation and adjustment would try to return to each owner a plot
located on or near his preadjustment holdings. Cash payments by land owners
to the executor and by the executor to land owners could also be used to even
out any slight discrepancies in the readjustment process. When the land
owners had approved the replotting plan and surveyors had reestablished the
field bounderies, public use sites and road rights-of-way, the executor would
issue new certificates of title and notify the provincial land registry that
the land readjustment had been completed. The use of land readjustment
procedures to regularize and consolidate agricultural plots, widen rural
access roads and create communal land for village schools, central squares
and religious structures, has been accepted in rural Korea since the 1930s.
Its use in urban areas has not been extensive until the mid-1960s.
3.        In August 1966, the government promulgated the Land Readjustment
Project Law in order to modify the existing uses of land readjustment and to
enhance its applications to urban areas. In the language of the Law, the
purpose was to "contribute toward the promotion of land zone planning,
adjustment and consolidation business to enhance fair and balanced
development of urban areas, and to improve the general welfare of the
citizens by stipulating matters concerning the implementation procedures,
processes and responsibilities for the expenses of land zone planning,
adjustment and consolidation business". (Article 1, Law #1822).



ANNEX 2
Page 2
4.         Local government administrators were quick to see the advantages
of using LR in preference to th',e -and e-propristio-  laws of 1061 and 1963
in their implemenLation of           p niter  oant  fc' uban aareas   Not only could
unplanned settlements be rs-uint land needed fcr highways, roads,
parks, schools, public squares, etc., could be obtained at no acquisition
cost to the municipality and land could be held in reserve by the executor
(usually the mayor) to be sold to cover the cost of grading, filling and
construction of infrastructure as well as overheads.
5.         Land owners cooperating in LR projects also benefitted in that
their land after reduction, i.e. the subtraction from their net holdings of
an appropriate percentage to be used for roads, community facilities, and
reserved land, became regularized urban land with basic services. The
increase in value of the land was often a factor of 4 to 6 times.
6.         LR has been used by a number of municipalities to regularize
quasi-legal urban land development, acquire land for major roads, and more
recently to develop land previously designated as agriculture but changed
to urban residential under the city master plans. After the 1966 LR law
enactment, land readjustment became the primary tool of Korean urban land
development. During the period 1966-74, for example, 251 LR projects were
carried out in Korean cities resulting in 327.5 sq km of urban land being
developed. In Seoul city alone, some 41 LR projects completed by 1974
accounted for nearly one third of the capital's developed area.  The land
returned to owners (LRO) has varied from about 80% during the formative
years of LR implementation (1966-76) to about 50% or even 45% during recent
years. The willingness of land owners to accept smaller percentages of
returned land reflect the progressively improved standard of infrastructure
provision and the inflation of land values in newly urbanized areas.
Presently a typical LR project in urban areas would result in the following
land use: about 30% for public use (including infrastructure and
commercial), 20% retained by the executor for market sales to recoup costs
and 50% returned to original owners.
7.         Small plotholders of the association whose holdings are reduced
after readjustment to a size less than 30 py, i.e. one half of the usual
minimum plot size of 60 py, must accept cash compensation for their
holdings; intermediate size plotholders, whose readjusted holdings are
between 30 py and 60 py -- the minimun plot size -- have the right to
purchase sufficient land to Zeacih the minimum plot size.
8.        The re-ent entry of KLDC into urban land development has resulted
in the introduction of an expanded concept of the meaning and use of
"reserved land" in LR undertakings, KLDG has proposed that the executors
LR projects use the highest possible reduction ratio to hold back more land
than is necessary for public use Iroads, parks, schools, etc.) plus land to
be resold to recover infrastructure construction costs. The additional
reserved land would be developed anrd 'sed for housing construction to meet
the needs of low-income families. The legality of this procedure is
established by Article 54 of the 1980 (Law 3255) revision of the Land
Readjustment Project Law.

Page 3
9.        The use of LR to develop serviced land for low-income housing
appears to offer several advantages over the use of the City Planning Law
(CPL) outright purchase procedures. The executing agency - the city, KLDC
or KNHC - does not have to purchase the land or use expropriation to force
land owners to sell. This reduces the capital flow of the developing agency,
particularly during the initial stages of development. Politically, the
executing agency is not seen as forcing owners to sell but rather as entering
into voluntary agreement on joint development of land for urban use.
10.       The major restraints to the wider use of LR by KLDC are:
(a) the cost of developed land is generally somewhat higher than the
same development using CPL; depending upon the cost of raw land
and the reduction ratio used;
(b) the legal procedures necessary to implement an LR project are more
complicated and time-consuming than CPL;
(c)  under current procedures a sizeable number of small land owners in
LR projects may be deprived of their holdings and forced to take
cash settlements while large land owners appear to benefit the
most; and
(d) the percentage of total developed land for low-income use may be
low considering the sizeable cash flows and administrative time
invested by the developer.
11.       All these restraints can be overcome in the following ways:
(a) Costs: Land returned to owners must be minimized (as low as 33%)
while maintaining a fair rate of return to the original owniers.
Table 1 shows the cost of development of serviced land for low-
income housing at Gunsan using CPL, LR at 44.6% land returned to
owners (the current project design) and LR at 37.5% LRO. The
cost per py before cross-subsidy is higher using LR (44.6% LRO)
than CPL. After cross-subsidization (i.e. the transfer of income
from commercial and open market residential land sales to offset
the cost of low-income land) the cost per py difference is only
6.7% higher for LR.  If the project were done by LR using 37.5%
LRO the cost of land for low-income would, after cross-subsidiza-
tion, be only 30,000/py, i.e., less than half of the CPL or LR 44.5%
costs. The land owner receiving 37.5% of his original holding back
as serviced urban land would be able to sell his plot (or part of
it) at more than twice what he could have gained by selling all of
his land at its pre-readjustment agricultural land use price.
(b) Shortening implementation time of LR projects: Critical path
methods and explicit assignment of responsibilities for detailed
implementation must be built into all LR projects (Chart 1 and



-50-                                ANNEX 2
Page 4
Tables 2 and 3). Using critical path methods, monitoring and
evaluation can be continual and KLDC feedback to the executing
agency, positive and goal-oriented.
(c) Protecting small land owners rights: The ownership patterns of
agricultural land holding in urban fringe areas shows a large
number of small plots. As a result, a high percentage of the
replotted land after acceptance of the LR executors readjustment
plan will be in small-sized urban plots, i.e., between the 27 py
minimum and the more standard 60 py urban lot size. This will
increase the percentage of total development land for low-income
use and will insure that small plotholders are not forced out of
the urban land market. Land owners whose pre-readjustment
holdings are 54 py or less should be assured the right and given
credit facilities to purchase land up to a minimum lot size
(27 py) or to trade their small plots developed value for
"vertical rights" in the newly constructed low-income housing.
Vertical rights are the right to occupy and own space in a
building controlled by the LR executor and a share in the ground
rights of the area occupied by the structure and its open space.
It is the equivalent of exchanging ownership in land (square
meters of surface rights) for condominium ownership of an
apartment (or percentage thereof) in a vertical structure and its
appropriate share in the land the building occupies plus a share
of the parking lots, playgrounds, lawns, driveway, etc.
(d) Increasing land availability for low-income purchasers. Large
land owners should be encouraged to divide their returned serviced
land into small plots (27-30 py) to enable a larger number of low-
income houses to be built. This could be done through tax
incentives. The percentage of total developed land for low-income
use can be enhanced by using land-use layouts that would encourage
small plots. KLDC is investigating the feasibility of purchasing
land in a LR project area prior to designation so that as a land
owner it could develop its returned land as minimum plots (27 py).
12.       LR has great potential as a major tool for development of serviced
land for housing low-income families - a use that the legislation did not
originally envision. The National Urban Land Development and Housing
Project offers an excellent opportunity to test the use of the LR concept
and to develop within KLDC the capability to use the technique creatively
and justly for the benefit of lower income families in Korea.

KOREA
NATIONAL URBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING PROJECT
Project Summary and Specifications for Phase I Sites
A. Changwon Site
1. SITE CHARACTERISTICS
Classification. Phase I site, City Planning Law (CPL) implementation.
Location. The site is located in the Myeonggok area, about 3.4 km northwest of the center of
Changwon, a new town and industrial complex located on a 30 m wide regional road 4 km from the Guam inter-
change on the Namhae Highway which connects Busan and Jinju. There are frequent bus and train services from
Changwon to the major cities in the region.
Existing Land Use. The site is 86% agricultural land, consisting predominantly of rice paddy..
Topography. A gently sloping basin traversed by the Naedong stream; much of the site is prone to
flooding.
2. DESIGN FEATURES
Site Preparation. An average of 2 m of fill will be required and can be taken from the hilly slopes
around the periphery of the contiguous KLDC second stage site.
Roads. The site is bounded on the south side by a proposed 30 m wide city arterial road, and con-
tains an internal 20 m wide road, both of which are in the city master plan. Most other site roads are 6 a
and 8 m in width. Initial paving of the 30 m road (funded through this project) will be limited to 7 m,
with future widening by others.
Water Supply. The site will be served by a trunk main extension from the existing city system,
which is scheduled for major expansion in capacity through a MOC project, by the mid-1980s. The distribu-
tion network on site will be 80 mm to 300 mm in size.
Drainage. The master plan for the new town mandates separation of storm water and sanitary waste-
water.  Runoff from the site itself will be collected in inlets along both edges of all roads, and piped to
improved channels of the Naedong stream (and one major tributary thereto) which pass through the site. Pipe
sizes vary, 45 mm to 1,000 mm.  About 95% of the watershed of the stream lies outside the site.  The exist-
ing 1.9 km of these natural channels within the site will be realigned into essentially straight, trape-
zoidal open channels, surfaced with interlocking precast concrete embankment paving blocks, locally manufac-
tured for this type of application. The channels and associated road bridges will be designed for a 20-year
storm event.
Wastewater Disposal. A network of sewers will collect sanitary wastewater generated on-site, con-
veying these flows by gravity to interceptors in the adjacent KLDC project site. Wastewater from the area
will eventually be treated at a municipal treatment plant which is under design and being financed in part
by the Asian Development Bank. In the event that the adjoining KLDC site development is not completed by
the time the IBRD supported works enter service, the collected wastewater will be temporarily diverted into
the Naedong stream, thence flowing to the sea.
Electric Power. The project site will be supplied power from primary transmission facilities in
the contiguous areas of Changwon City to the southeast. Electrical distribution will include street
lighting.
Community Facilities. The project site contains a primary and a middle school, a kindergarten, a
church and a home for senior citizens. The latter will be constructed by Changwon City.
Commercial Area. Two small neighborhood shopping centers are located on the site and a larger
shopping center will be built on the adjacent second stage KLDC development.
Off-site Infrastructure. A cost sharing scheme has been set up by Changwon City whereby off-site
infrastructure is funded through the levy of a 5.84% fee on site construction costs.  Off-site infrastruc-
ture, which is necessary to the project site consisting of an access road, utility mains (water supply,
sanitary and storm sewers) bridges and stream improvements are to be separately funded by KLDC. These off-
site works are contained within, and necessary for, the second stage KLDC Changwon site.

B. Pohang Site
1. SITE CHARACTERISTICS
Classification. Phase I site, City Planning Law (CPL) implementation.
Location. In Jangseang Dong and Woochang Dong in Pohang City, on the east coast of the country in
Gyeong Bug Do province. The site is 11 km from the existing Pohang Industrial Estate across city bay, and
5 km from Pohang City Hall.
Existing Land Use. Approximately 80% of the site is currently under cultivation, as rice paddy
and dry field.
Topography. Over 99% of the site lies at less than 10% slopes providing natural drainage to the
coast to the southeast of the site. The site is located in a V-shaped valley (in plan) and surrounded by
forested hills. The central portion of the site is poorly drained being a depression lower than the
remainder. The watershed draining to the site is small, about 42 ha.
2. DESIGN FEATURES
Site Preparation. Soils underlying much of the site contain relatively soft clays of marine
origin; the potential for subsidence requires attention in design of foundations for road embankments and
heavy structures. Subsurface "paper" drains and earth surcharging will be used to stabilize soils beneath
road embankments; apartments will be founded on bearing piles or other foundation system suited to the soil
horizon. No special foundations are likely to be required for core or row houses. Site earthwork involves
about 158,000 cu m of net borrow, which will be obtained from an available borrow area adjoining the site.
Roads. A 10 m wide road roughly bisects the site, and connects to the 30 m main coastal highway
at the southern edge of the site. This principal road will in future be extended to join another major road
proposed in the cityas master plan. The other roads on-site are 8 m and 6 m wide.
Water Supply. The site will be connected to the existing city distribution system with a 200 mm
pipe 235 m long. The 1,200 mtd projected demand is less than 1% of the rated capacity of the existing muni-
cipal system.
Drainage. The sewer system will be a combined type, with both storm runoff and sanitary waste-
water conveyed to the sea through a natural channel located just south of the site. The collection system
will consist of 5.8 km of concrete piping and box conduits, augmented by paved gutters to collect runoff
from the hillside watershed lying above the developed area.
Electric Power. Electric service will be extended to the site by KECO, from existing feeders in
the developed areas of the city immediately to the southeast of the site. KECO will also install street
lighting.
Community Facilities. Dongbu Primary School is located near the intersection of the site access
road with the coast road 200 m south of the site. Pohang Junior School is located 2 km from the site and
Pohang Fishery adjacent High School 400 m from the site. The Dong office and a police post are adjacent to
primary school. Therefore the community facilities provided on site will be limited to a kindergarten, two
playgrounds and old people's pavilion.
Commercial Areas. The land use plan incorporates two neighborhood commercial areas to serve the
community, site on the major roads. Included will be a market, 5 small restaurants, 8 small shops, a public
bath, and a clinic.
Off-site Infrastructure. Off-site works are very limited, consisting of minor lengths of water
supply and drainage system facilities, and are not a significant element in overall project cost.
Miscellaneous. It is planned that the city will establish a ferry service to link a point on the
coast 500 m from the site to the industrial estate.

C. Yeochan Site
1. SITE CHARACTERISTICS
Classification. Phase I site, City Planning Law (CPL) implementation.
Location. The project site is located in Ssangbong Myeon of Yeochan City approximately 600 m
east of the CBD and City Hall, about 10 km southwest of Yeosu City and 5 km north of the Yeochan Industrial
Estate. The site is part of a larger area to be developed in stages by KLDC.
Existing Land Use.  The site is made up of 310 parcels consisting of 46% dry fields, 20% paddy
fields and 16 wooded areas.
Topography. The site is situated in a narrow valley, 150-200 m wide containing two small streams.
A third of the site has less than 10% slope and 75% of it has less than 20% slope.
2.   DESIGN FEATURES
Site Preparation. Site grading will result in an excess of fill which will be used to advantage
on the second stage adjacent KLDC development site.  The average cut is 1.6 m and fill 1 m.
Roads. Regional roads running through the site consist of a 35 m wide road linking Yeochan and
Yeosu City and a 25 m wide branch leading to the coastal area of Yeochan. MOC is responsible for the
Yeochan/Yeosu road and had purchased a 15 m right of way of which a 10 m width will be initially con-
structed, providing a 7 m wide pavement. This road is scheduled for completion at the end of 1980, and will
serve as a major bus route. The remaining 20 m right of way, 10 m on each site (to be funded and built by
this KLDC project) will be used for service roads and sidewalks to provide access to housing.
Water Supply. The site will be served by the Yeochan City system. The 300 mm main connecting the
project network to the municipal system will also serve future development off the site, which is recognized
in the cost-sharing aspects of the project.
Drainage. Yeochan is a new town, with a master plan requiring separation of storm and sanitary
sewer systems. Drainage will consist of drain pipes and box culverts beneath the roads, discharging to cor-
responding lines in the contiguous area being developed directly by KLDC. The system for the entire project
site generally conforms to the existing natural drainage channels, which flow to the sea through a sea dike
with sluice gate 3 km south of the Phase I site.
Wastewater Disposal. A separate sanitary sewer system will convey site wastes into interceptors in
the KLDC project, which in turn will ultimately deliver the flows, via one proposed lift station to a muni-
cipal treatment plant planned on the foreshore south of the city. In the event that unforeseen circum-
stances delay construction of the receiving works in the KLDC project, the collected sanitary flows will be
temporarily discharged into a natural drainage channel at the (downstream) boundary of the site.
Electric Power. KECO will extend power service to the site from existing system in contiguous
areas.
Community Facilities. The Yeochan master plan calls for various public, commercial and administra-
tive facilities to be constructed 200 m north of the site and there is an existing primary school 700 m west
of the site. Therefore on-site community facilities will be limited to two kindergartens, three playgrounds
and a small park area.
Commercial Areas. Site development includes two small areas for markets and other commercial
activity.
Off-site Infrastructure. With MOC executing the arterial road which provides access to the site,
off-site infrastructure in the project is modest, consisting principally of 570 m of 300 mm water line join-
ing the project network to the city system.

D. Gunsan Site
1. SITE CHARACTERISTICS
Classification. Phase I site, Land Readjustment (LR) implemeritation.
Location. The project site is located in Saryongdong, 4 km west of Gunsan City Hall and 3 km from
the center of the new coastal industrial park and port. This site forins the first stage of land readjust-
ment project area to be developed in three stages by KLDC.
Existing Land Use. Approximately 48% of the site currently consists of dry fields and rice pad-
dies and 40% iswoodland.
Land Ownership. There are 198 landowners within the site area, 12 of whom will be left with less
than 13.5 py after readjustment and will be bought out, and 15 of whom will be left with over 13.5 py but under
27 py (the legal minimum lot size) and will have the option of buying land. About 9.7% of the site is in
public ownership.
Topography. The site mostly consists of low areas surrounded on the east by steep hilly slopes.
There is an existing rock outcrop on the site which is being used by contractors to the city as a quarry for
constructing the industrial park and port structures and associated roads. The quarrying operation con-
tinues, and it is anticipated that this outcrop will have been entirely remaoved by late 1981.
2. DESIGN FEATURES
Site Preparation. Removal of the rock outcrop currently being quarried is necessary for use of
the proposed site development plan. The tides along this part of the coast have an annual range in excess
of 7 m, and filling of all site areas now at an elevation below 8 m is necessary to provide reasonable drain-
age during period of high tide. For this reason, the low areas near the access road will require about I m
of fill.
Roads. Access to the city's urban area is excellent; a new 35 in regional east-west road, allowing
traffic bound for the new port complex to bypass the CBD, bisects the site. This road is under construction,
funded by the city. Principal roads serving circulation within the site consist of a 35 m and 20 m roads
along the northerly boundary, and a 15 m road running along the north-south axis of the site.  Most other
roads are 8 m and 6 a wide.  Construction will include subbase, base course, curbs and gutters and asso-
ciated drainage structures, but wearing course paving will be limited to a 7 m width of the 15 m and 20 m
roads, and all roads in the low-income housing area.
Water Supply. Water service will be extended from the city system; all required improvements
thereto, as well as the complete distribution network on-site, will be funded by the city.
Drainage. The drainage system will be a combined type, with closed conduits conveying sanitary
and storm wastes by gravity to an existing large drainage canal borderinig the site on the west which drains,
through a sluice gate control structure, into the bay 2.5 km north of the site. The project includes slight
realignment of about 600 m of this canal, to permit the 20 m west perimeter road to be sited in accordance
with the city master plan. A significant portion of the watershed draining to the piped system lies within
the adjoining KLDC project site, and the cost of the associated incremental system capacity is recognized in
the cost-sharing philosophy adopted for the site.
Electric Power.  Electric power will be obtained from the existing KE(:O primary power feeoer which
is located along the 35 m road traversing the site.
Community Facilities. These are existing primary and middle schools on the site boundaries, and
therefore no schools are included in the master plan. However, approximately 4,150 py of reserved land is
proposed to be given to the middle school, to facilitate future expansion. Seven playgrounds are included,
one of which is located in the consolidated reserved land for low-income housing.
Commercial Areas.  Three small market areas are planned, two of which are in the low-intcome area.
Off-Site Infrastructure. Existing and planned city commitments for road work, water supply, and
rock outcrop removed are substantial. However, about 70( of the W 1,700 million involved is for the quarrying
operation, itself funded through the ongoing port and industrial estate construction contracts for which the
crushed rock material is required. The water supply facilities (trunk mains on the site, plus local distri-
bution in the low-income area) involve about 4.4 km of lines, 60% in sizes lOU mm or smaller.
Miscellaneous. Costs for local infrastructure in the low-income area and directly charged in the
land cost therein includes local road paving (W 272 million) and approximately 820 m of minor drainage
piping (W 17 million).

NATIONAL URBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING PROJECT
Technical Assistance Program
1.        The technical assistance component of the project includes:
(a) training of KLDC and KNHC staff; (b) advisory services for KLDC;
(c) project preparation; (d) monitoring and evaluation of the project; and
(e) a housing sector study. The estimated costs for the technical assist-
ance program are given in Table 6, Annex 7. The five elements of the
program are briefly described below.
Staff Training
2.        This component is intended to provide on-the-job as well as
overseas training for KLDC and KNHC staff. KNHC has identified a training
program, mostly overseas, for its staff in the areas of real estate planning
and management, finance, engineering and construction. KLDC proposes to
establish its program through an assessment of the training needs of its
staff which is being done. The KLDC training program would cover short and
medium-term needs including (a) overseas training and orientation; (b) in-
service training activities; (c) agency exchanges and secondment; and
(d) management seminars.
Advisory Services
3.        KLDC has relied substantially on local consultants to prepare
this project. While build-up of its staff is remarkable, KLDC would
continue to need consultants because of its ambitious program. The Bank
project preparation and appraisal missions assisted KLDC in review of the
consultants work. KLDC would need similar assistance in review of Phase II
sites and preparation of the second project which is expected to start in
middle of 1981. It is proposed that KLDC would hire two or three advisors
for short durations (3-6 months) to assist its staff in the areas of
physical planning, engineering and real estate planning.
Project Preparation
4.        Funds are provided for feasibility studies and engineering designs
of the second land development project for which KLDC plans to start
preparation in middle of 1981. Local consultants are expected to do most
of the technical work. KLDC financed these services for this project.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.        Because of the government-s interest in expanding this program
rapidly and the Bank's interest in assisting Korea in the sector on a
programmatic basis, this project will carefully be monitored and evaluated.



- 63 -                     ANNEX 6
Page 2
The monitoring will be split into two exercises for land development and
housing, to be undertaken probably by local university groups on >ehalf of
KLDC and KNHC respectively. The two studies will focus on, inter
alia, the following issues:
(a) Land development: site selection, marketability of land, internal
cross-subsidization assumption, effect of land readjustment
projects on the original owners - including those who have been
squeezed out of the project and the rest who stay and get direct
financial benefits from the LR projects; and
(b) Housing: selection criteria and procedures; affordability
analysis; suitability of site plans, house designs, and housing
type mix; modes and nature of house expansion; and residents
attitude to the project.
Housing Sector Study
6.        The Bank has been engaged in a dialogue with the Korean government
on housing sector problems and policies. A number of issues or problem
areas have been identified where further information and analysis would be
required for policies to be formulated and implemented. It is proposed to
undertake a study which will be carried out by KNHC with the assistance of
consultants. A committee consisting of representatives from the MOC Housing
Bureau, the Economic Planning Bureau of EPB, KLDC, KNHC and KHB, will provide
policy guidance, approval of terms of reference and review of draft reports
for the study.  The study will explore following three major interrelated
areas:
(a) the supply and means for mobilization of financial resources
for the housing sector would be examined in depth. The examina-
tion would cover, inter alia, the appropriateness of the interest
rate structure in the housing sector, funds available from
institutions and individuals in the private sector, for invest-
ment and for housing purchase, and from the public sector,
including various levels of government and subordinate agencies;
(b) the range of possible housing types and the attractiveness of
each to the housing market would be examined. The study here
would: include types and sizes of housi-ag units, such as high
rise, walk-up apartments, row houses, core houses and single-
family houses; consider the desirable level and timing of the
production of such units, and, finally, review current housing
supply plans and programs in comparison with the findings on
types, levels and timing of housing demanded; and
(c) the variety of financing instruments for housing purchase and the
acceptability of each to potential purchasers would be determined.



-64-                          ANNEX 6
Page 3
These instruments would include conventional mortgages, hire-
purchase systems, variable rate mortgages, shared appreciation
mortgages and graduated payment mortgages, among others. The
determination of acceptability would take into account both
purchasers income levels and potential housing types.
7.        The study would evaluate the potential impact on KHB, KLDC, KNHC
and any other housing finance institutions and government budgets of housing
programs which would mobilize resources, provide housing and offer financing
consistent with the conclusions and recommendations reached in each major
area of study. In addition, the impact of demolition policies, the cost
and applicability of housing improvement versus new dwelling production and
of rehabilitation and upgrading programs, and the costs and benefits of
rental housing would also be assessed.
