PROJECT COPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is   combined Project Completion Report (PCR) for the First and
Second National Urban Land Devlopment and Housing Projects (Loans 1980-KO  nd,.
2216-KO).  The PCR1 ';onsiders both projects simultandously since they had
similar objectives and were implemented sequentially by the same agencies, the
Korea Land Development Corporation (KLDC) and the Korea National lousing
Corpt,"ation (KNUC).  Loan 1980-KO was approved on April 201, 1981 for US$90
million and was closed on June 30, 1986, 18 months later than planned due to
annicrea ed scope of works and some implementation delays. Due to savings
under the yeojectv US$14.6 million of the loan was cancelled in 1984 at
Govevnment s tequest and US$4.0 million was cancelled at loan closing. Loan
2216-KO was approved on December 14, 1982 for US$100 million and was closed on
March 31, 1987 after being fully disbursed.
This report was\ prepared- by the Asia Country Department II
infrastructure Division,sbased on a draft and data provided by the implement-
ing agencies as well as information in the project files. The PCR was
discussed wvii the implementing agencies and.government staff during a visit
-i MXY 1988 and their comments were incorporated.  The valuable assistance
ptwvided by the\Korean Government and project staff met during the preparation
of this report is gratofully acknowledged.
TIhis PCR was rea4 by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR\was sent to the Borrower for comments. However, they had no\
coflfents to make.

i.    '.The projects were primoVily designed to provide affordable housing
to lot-oincome groups in Korea' a -uian areas thtough the construction of
,housing by the Korea Rational Housing 4C6rporation (KH), using l*d 4eveloped
by the gCorea Land Developusat Corporationk (MMD). The projects were al.so
expected, to imUprove the policy and institutional framawork of the Korean
housing sector, with a focus under Loan 1980 on strengthening MMD's 
capability to provide seirviced resid ~tiat sites and. under Loan 22169 ona
supporting the development of-the MaIna Housing fund (UHF) with a view to
establishi'ng a viable financial intermediary for the public housing sector
(oazas. 2.2-i.O4. The proJects financed: (a) the developumet for residential and
commercia ptdrposes of 1.75. million pyUng (py) of land under Loan L19" and 1.43

ii.    Th%s pr@jocta succeeded in accomplishing their main objective of
providing ne* housing affordable to lower-income families, and were notable
for MM'Cs succoes in significantly surpassing the original land development targets '
(paras. 3.7-3.1]). Institutional strengthenking uader the prpjects has led to epihance
roles for KLDC and DEC in the sector and the development of the NIP as a key
agency in the provisi* of, finance f\or lower, income, housing development. KLDC
particulary benef.Atted fro* improved, more analytical proc dures for site
evaluation and select~.oim based on financial and economic cetiteria.
Implementation of recomedtions of sector studies carried out under the
projects has resulted in both improved sector policies, particularly with
respect to addressing the housing problems of the poor through developmntof
rental housing, and a more comprehensive data syste  to permit better, monitoring
a~kd,\aalysis of Sector activities (paas.3.17-3..9). 'As a result'of experience
gAinqed under the projects, a fr mrk for project identification,
preparation, appraisal and implJ. tation was established which allowed the
Bmnk to support two further projects oa.PrIogrammatic basis-one in' land

iii,      The major problem iE project implementat\4on was the lack of a
satisfactory mechanism to promote consultation and coordination tIqtween fLDt
and KNUC,9 the two main executing agencies (para. 4.5). Housing construction was
occasionaily delayed\by disagreements between the two on the suitability of
land developed by KLDC for low-cost housing. The cause of this contention cau
be traced to the different objectives and interests of the two agencies, with
KLDC established to provide large areas of developed land for,residential and
industrial purposes,      as low a price as possible, and KNHC to,provide low-.
income housing which first of all must be marketable. KNHC did, however, meet
its construction targets by developing some sites itself.  This problem might
have been avoided had sufficient authority and more carefully defined roles
been assigned to the Liaison Committees established under the-projects to
coordinate the work of the two agencies.
iy.       The development of NWV has also been somewhat different than originally
eipected (para. 4.6)'\.  While NHF has grown rapidly, it\has not been assigned
responsibility for project appraisal and supervision.  This, however, has not
been a problem to date as NHF is able to obtain these services from,another
institution at reasonable cost. NHF has been operated in a financially viable
manner and has gradually improvid the targeting of its loans to lower-income
buyers. The latest measures in this respect have been introduced in
cog unction with the Bank-assisted Housing Finance Sector Pro3ect (Loan 2853-
KO).
V.        Project unit\'costs under both projects were substantially below
ezpectations due to low bids from contractors due to intense\competition to.obtain
work during the recessionary period of the early 1980s (para. 3.20). KLDC used some
of these savings to develop additional sites, but US$14.6 million of Loan 1980 X
was ca celled in 1984 to reflect savinps in housing\costs and another US$4.0
million wa' cancelled at loan closito.  Loan,2216 wis fully di'bursed.
vi.       Regarding cost-recovery performance, the actual cost of land
development was recovered by KLDC, which sold commercial and middle-income
residential plots developed under the project at market ptices to subsidize land
sold to KNHC for low-incoue housing (para. 5.5). KNHC recovered appr*'biate cost8a of
\housing construction through the sale of those units to low-income buyers.
'Sales performance was good under both projects, except for core houses whicitt
proved unattractive to buyers who, because of rising incomes and the increased
affordability of larger apartments, preferred the larger units.
vii.      The project objective of providing housing units to lower-income
families, defined as those in the second quartile of the urban income
\distributioit under the first project and th-e15th to 50th percentiles of the
\income distribution in the second project, seems to have been achieved (para. 5.6).
According to K'.C data, 83; of housing units coEstructed under Loan 1980 were
affordable to"buyers below the 29th percentile, with the rest affordable to
those below the 39th percentile. ,Under Loin 22169 78Z ot all units were

Overall, the projects were successful in addresiing deficiencies in
housing availab*lity' and housing policies, -and in strengthening the abilities
of the housing sector institutions, espeitilly of KLDC. The economic
performance of the two projects likewise proved sati factoryp with rates of
return of 14S and 22%, respectively (pata. 6.2).

tOREA
FIRST AMD SK0OND NATIONAL URBAN L4D D1V9MPE  AND
HOUSING PROJECTS (Loans 1980 and 2216-KD)
Project Completion Report
I . IMODUCTION
1.1       Since the early 1970s, Korea's urbn population has been increasing
rapidly, in tandem with the country's impressive economic develooment. Be-
tween 1970 and 1980, the urban population increased by 93#, much higher than
the 202 increase of the national population overall. In 1980, some 60S of the
total population lived in urban areas, and this is projected to increase to
75Z by 1991. At the same time, average household sise has been decreasing,
from 5.37 persons per household (p/hh) in 1970, to 4.7 plhh in 1980 and 4.23
p/hh in 1985. The declining household size resulted in a particularly rapid
-groth in the numr of urban households, which increased by an average 72
p.a. during 1970-859 comared to the national average of 3% p.a. This ii turn
resulted in an acute ahortage of available residential sites and housaing
units, particularly in newly developed small- and medium-sized cities.  The
housing shortage ratio (i 10.  1-housing units/households a 100) increased from
25.6% in 1975'to 28.8% in 1980 and to 30,2Z in 19859 despite an investment of
5.3Z of CUP for the construction of 114 millioa housing units by the public
and'\private se'tors in 1976-80 and 5.06Z of GUP in 1981-85 for the construc-
tion of 1.02 million additional units. Aside from the rapid increase in the
number of households, part of the housing problem was due to widespread
housing dpmolition during the 1970s when gom t  rograms f6r industriali-
ation and urbanizatipn were being empbaSisedo Almost 900,000 housing units
were demolished in the course of the decade0
1.2       I  1979-80s, the Government responded to the accelerating housing
shortage by 'developing specific measures to increase the output of both the
public and private housing sectors, and by issuing in Oct6ber 1980 a Master
Plan for Public Housing Construction and National Urban Land Development.
This comprehensive plan inclied quaMtitative targets for housing construction
and investment in the sector, eapansion of the putblic sector role in housing,
and measures to reduce construction costs and increase the supply of housing
finAnce. The Plan was also important by incl aing a program for the provision
of housing to the lov-income population, including measures to stabilize land
prices. lI this, the Government sought to further its goal of establishing
social equity by mitigating the housing shortage.
1 3       Investment allocations under the Fifth Five-Year Economic and Social
elopment Plan (1982-86) buttressed the Housing Master Plan by giuving hous-
ing first priority in its strategy to meet the basic ne"ds of urban dwellers
and,to improve the quality and availa,bility of urban serVices. The Plan

included investment of 5.33X of GNP in new housing and annual production of
286,000 uiiits (124,000 by the public sector and 162,000 by the private
sector), with 922 of the units slated for urban areas.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Background
241       The Bank and the Goverment began discussing toe possibility of an
urban housing project in 1975, but differences between the two rtgarding
housing policies prevented further action. However, with the issuance of the
Housing Master Plan and the Government's heightened interest in taking a more
4ominant-role in\the housing sector, agreement was reached on a mutually
satisfactory approach to housing development.  Experience gained under two
pi,tvous Bank-supported regional development projects in the GCangju Region
(Loans 1070 and 1758-KO), t4hich both included substantial housing component's
reinforced Government's commitment to the housin4 9roject,by demonstiating the
feasibility 'of the approaches proposede  The project was one component of the
Government's development strategy to place increased emphasig on expanding the
benefits of economic growth, both geographically throughout the country and
vertically to income groups which had fallen far behind in obtaining the basic
-amenities for living, such as housing and community facilitles.  The project
was prepared by staff from the Korea Land DevelQpqzet Corporation (KLDCY}  the
Korea National Housing Corporation (KNHC), and the Mitistry tf Construction
(1OC) and appraised by the Batk-in September 1980.  The project loan for US$90
million was approved In April 1981.-
2.2       The project hid four primary.objectives:
(a)  to develop the capabilities of KLDC to provide serviced sites on',
large scale;
(b)  to provide affordable housing to the second quartile of th~ income
distribution through  NHC;                          \
.(c)  to "stablish'-a framework for project identification, preparation,
apprtisal and implementation in the hou4ing sector so fhat the tank
c6uld support future projects on a programmatic basist;and
(d)  to assist in establishing a policy framework for the Korean housing
sectore
2J        Preparation of the Second Urban Land Development and Housing Project
began shortly after the first project was approved in order \to provide further
support to objectives sought under the Fifth Five-Year Plan and to reinforce
and expand the inititution building initiated under the first project.
Particular emphasis Ma placed on development of th4 Nat4onal Housing Fund
(UHF) which was estabtished in July 1981 to raise and fa4litate the supply of
housing finance and thus enable,the Government to carry out its housing
construction program under.the Five-Year Plan.  Rather than focussing on
details of Coverpment's housing construction progm, the- secon4 project



3-
VV
emphasized reaching agreements between Government and the Bank on the
processes, principles and criteria by which land and housing development
programs and projects would be prepared and implemented.
2.4       In keeping with this orientation, the project was intended to:
(a) assist in the rationalization of roles and functions and strengthen
the housing and land development institutions in the public
sector.  Specifically, NHF would assume a more prominent role in
long-term housing finance, absorbing functions of the pr'evious
K public sector low-income housing finance program managi4 by the
Korea Housing Bank and the foreign loan program previously managed
by INHC. In addition, KNHC would be encouraged to focus on housing
construction and KLDC on developing land for industrial sites,
residential areas and low-cost housing. The basis for formalating
housing programs and determining the housing mix was to be iLmproved,
and a coordinated and rationalized system for city and site
selection was to be developed and implemented;
(b)  support the development of NHF with a view to establishing a viable
financial intermediary with a capability for project appraisal and
suparvision; and
(r.)  support the policies and programs for improving the delivery of
housing to lower-income families by financing the development of
land and housing by KLDC, KIHC, housing cooperatives and local
authorities. The primary target income group was the 15#h to the
50th percentile of the urban household income distributioe.
2.5       The second project was prepared by the same agencies as the first
project, appraised in March/April 1982-and the project loan (2216-.K0) for
US$100 million was approved on December 16, 1982.
B. Project Descriptions
2.6       Each project had three components--land development, housing con-
struction and technical assistance. -
2.7       Land Development.  Under the firsi project KLDC was 4*pected to pro-
vide,servicing of about 1.75 million pyung _  (py) of urban land, including
about 11,300 plots for low- and middle-inc4me families. In the second
project, it was expected to develop about 1.43 million py,-including land for
some 22,900 plots for low and middle-income housing. Community facilities and
ther services were-also to be provided in the developed areas.  Land develop-
Qaeut was to be carried out in 10 sites in the-first project and 14 sites in
the second project. At each site, part of the land (50% of the residential
area under the first project and 40% 1.nder the second prpject) Aas earmarked
for low-income households-,and sold to\ -      KLDC was-to sell the remaining
, On py g i equ v    t                                                 i.

1sed for commercial use or as residential plots for the middle-income
populce.- The prof$to gained through the open market sale of this land was to
be utilized to loV r the sale price of the low-incosm plots, thus cross-
subsidizing them.-,
2.8       Housing Construction.  Under the first projece, KKHC was expected to
construct 8,562 housing units on land developed by KLDC for the second
quartile of tIle urban incose distribution.  In the second project, it was
expected to bxild about 10,100 housiqg units for the 15th to 50th percentiles
of the urban household income distribution. In the secontdproject, KLDC was
expected to provide 10,300 middle-income serviced lots and, in cooperation
with the local governmentsp to support construction of 2,5OO housing units by
housing co6peratives in speckfied areas.
2.9       Th?e housing mix in the first projecl was expected to be 40%
expandable \core houses, 30S roy houses and 301 walk-up apartments. Based on
usperience gained under the earlier project (para. 3.4), the housiag mlx under
t'he later project was changed to 101 core houses, 30X row houses azd 60X
apartmeats.  In terms of prioject beneficiaries, 352 of housing units under
Loan 1980 were intended for families in the 20th to 29th percentiles, 50% for;
the 30th to 39th percentiles, and 151 for the 40th to 50th percentiles. Under
Loan Z216, 301 of the units were intended for the 15th to 19th percentiles,
501 for the 20th to 39th percentileg, and 202 to the 40th to 50th percentile
of the income distribution. The units constructed under the project vere
expected to be affordable, requiring a meimuw of 30% of monthly Eousehold
income for mortgage payments. Table 1 summarizes project targetsL.

2ol      Technical Assistance.  The first project supported on-the-job and
overseas training of 111 _and  EC staff in areas such as real estate plaming
and managemt, engineering, construction and finace.  Under the second
project,-this was expanded to include training for the staff of NOC, the
agency primarily responsible for housing sector policy and for managing HFH.
Assistance was also provided under both projects for the preparation of subse-
queG  projets, monitoring and evaluation of VXC and EC operations, and the
ezecueioo of housing sector and polity studies.
PROJECT  LEETATION
A. Effectiveness
3.1       The fitst project was presented to the Bank's Board on April 30,
1981, and the Loan Agreement was siged on May 13, 1981. After the signing of
a Subsidiary Loan Agreement betwven the Government and both KLDC and ERHC,
which was a condition of loan effectivEness, the Loan becam effqctikve on;
August '11 1981.
3.2      The second project was prsente4 to the Bank's 8oard on December 14,
1982, and the Loan Agreement was signed od Decembei\ 20, 1982. Signing of Sub-
sidiary 4pan Agreements between the  ovrnment and boch VL=C and KHF, whi¶h
was a %ondition of loan effectiveness, took place on tebruary 9, 1983, In7

qualifications as a legal entity empowered to sign the Subsidiary Loan Agree-
.menqt  the Loan Agreement had to be amended prior to effectiveness on May 31,
'19830
B. Revisions to the Projects
3e3       The first project was originally intended to develop land and
housing in ten areas spread throughout the country.  fovever, because bid
prices were about 25% lower than.expected due to intense competition among
contractors for work during the economic slowdown of the early 1980s, RLDC was
able to increase the project's land \development area with the additionof
'three more sites (Cwangju-Yomju, Chongju-Shinbong II, and Seoul-Cudok)\ The
Kunsan site was alsq replaced by one in Busan due to expected weak demand.
3.4       The housing mix and ho4sing sites and sizes were also modified.  The
housing mix for low-income units was changed from a 40730:30 ratio of
core:row:apartment houses to 20:30:50 due,to'(a) weak demand for core houses,.
indicated by a survey and the disappointing sales perforp%ance of core houses,
only 19X of which were sold by November 1,983; and (b) the, higher cost of core
houses which, on a cost per pyung basis, were a third more expensive to build
than apartments since they required more scarce and expensive land than did
apartments. ,At the iime of project formulation, core houses represented a new
type of houping unit which closely approximated the single-family dwelling
prefeired by Koreans, but kt a cost affordable to the lowest income group.  In
the interim, however,,incomes in Korea had risen faster than construction
costs, resulting in a&.shift in demand to larger apartment units. Although the
poor sales record for core houses may have been partly due to an unaggressive
marketing strategy and a design modification (fr4pa semi-detached houses.to
less desirable one-story row houses), the enhance4 affordability of apartments
due.to desig8  changes causedj,the Bank to approve the changed housin- mix in,
January 1984. This included a change in the housing unit size which, because
of improved des.igns and construction techniques for some housing
configur tions,\could be increased to 17 py and 20 py for some apartments.
Some ccnstruction sites were also changed due to KNEC's doubts about the
marketability of cettain sites developed by KLDC. KOf the 13 sites devel  ped
by KRHC, 9 were provided by KLDC.
3.5       Similar changes were introduced under Loan 2216.  Thi land
development area was increased by 45% with the addition of two extra sites in
Gwangju and Kimhae. In all, 16 sites were developed by KLDC. Of the 12-sites
developed by KNHC under the project, 10 Oere developed by KLDC and 2 by KNHC
itself.  The housing mix was likewise changed from a 10:30:60 mix of
core:row:apartment houses to 0:20:80.. In actuality, 88X of project housing
was in the forip of apartment units. This was again due to changing demand
patterns. Also. the origina, plan to build 2,500 houses for housing
cooperatives in Daejon and Euijongbu was not realized since Government
determined that the typical income of a ptospective cooperative member was
above that of the project.target group. A comparison of planned and actual
implementation sites is given in Anzex 1 and the attached maps.

C C. Project Progress
Land DevelopmentV
3.6  \    Implementation of the first project was originally scheduled for a
three-year periods mid 1981-84, but vat not completed until December 19#5 due
to the increase in project scope and a somewhat overoptimistic implementation
schedule for housing construction. The second project was also scheduled for
a three-year period (late 1982 to end 1985) and was completed in December
1986, one year later than expected. Planned and actual implementation
schedules are shown in Annex 2.
3.7       Loan 1980. KSome 2.48 million py were developed under the project,
~40 cmare than expected, largely due to savings arising frdm low bid prices.
Implementation by KLDC was both efficient and timely. Land development was
carried out in two phoses, with the first four sites identified prior to
project start-up and th~e remaining nine selected thereafter on the basis of
criteria agreed between'the Bank and KLDC. Sites were selected in cities with
pusœing shortage ratios of greater than 30% and populations.above 100,000.
The Seoul-Goduk site also presented an opportunlty to,undertake pollution
abatement measures for the Han River. V
3.8       Land was developed in aicordance with either the Public Manag6d
Development-,method (PMD) or the Land Readjustment (LR) scheme.  The PMD is a
comprehensive procedure based on related laws, such as the C'ty Planning Law,
the Housing Site Development Promotion Law (HSDP), the Housini  Construction,
Prootion Law aid the Industrial Estate Development Promotion Law.  Under PHI),
tie public authority purchases the entire area proposed for development and
sells the land after development to the actual ,users. This procedure prevents
the land from becoming a target of pr6fiteeringj but is unpop"lar with
landowners and local officials due to the 'lon  time needed and difficulty
involved it providing compensatipn for the land.  Under L, however, the
public authority develops the lad in participation with.ihe landowner. 'In
the first project, of the 13 siteW developed, 8 were under the PMD.
3.9       Of the total area developed under the project,\62% was for
residential purposes, 4% went to commercial-development and 34X was for public.
K     usts such as roads and parks.  Overall, 27% of the land developed was sold for
low#income housing. No problems were encountered in selling the remaining
land.
3.10      KLDC and Seoul City proposed to link the sew"rage system from the
Seoul-Go4uk site to off site trunk.interceptor sewers tpd treatment facilities
being built by Seo I City under the Han River Comprehenskve ievelopment
Plan.  However, tha on-site treatment facilities and disposal schem.e initially
proposed did not meet recently introduced regulations regarding effluent
quality under the Environmental Preservation Law. In order to indirectly
obtain disbursement for part of the estimated foreign exchange costs of the
off-site facilities, KLDC proposed that-the Bank raise the disbursement per-
centage on the remaining civil works :ontracts for this site, already ongoing,
from tho project-vide level of\46% to Z0Z, and the Bank agreed.

3.11      Loan 2216,  S"me 2.08 million py were developed under the second
project, 45X morethan expected at appraisal, due to the addition of two
sites. A\1 development followed the PMo method, except for one site. Of the
total ared.developed, 61ZM was for residential purposes, l.5C for commercial
usep and the remainder vet to public uses. Of the total land developed, 251
went to the low-income target group. Implementation was again satisfactory,
and sale of the land developed pre'ented no problems.  Land development under
the two projects, broken down by site and use, is given in Annex 3.
lousing Construction
3.1i      Loan 1980.  A total of 8,620 housing units were constructed under
the project, about 60 more than expected at appraisal. Overall, about 39Z of
the units were larger than planned due to the cbange in the housing unit sise
(para. 3.4). Housing construction was initially delayed by four to nine
months while MNC carried out studies on the housing mix to assess demand for
various types of units in light of the slowdown in the economy. Ths timing
and composition of the housing program was adjusted as a result of tIese
studies. 'ConstructioW was.delayed by another six to nine months over the
course of the project due to disagreements between KIHC and KLDC over the
appropriateness of sites developed for low-income housing, K=IC's decision to
develop some sites itself, and the need for further studies to justify
changing the housing unit min. Thereafter, construction progressed smoothly.
3.13      Loan 2216.  A total of 10,124 housing units.were construct4d on 12
sites3 about equal to the target of 109100. As in thi earlier project,
disagreements between KLDC and KNIC over site se'ection and KNC' a reserva-
tios about the proposed housing min and the marhetability Of core houses led
to somewhat slower than expected implemetation during the pioject'a early
years. At completion, about 301 of the units constructed under the ptoject
were larger than 19 py, compared.to app*aisal expectations that no unit would
be larger than 17 py. Annes 4 gives a breakdown of housing units constructed
under the projects by site and unit  ises, and compares act*al accomplishments
with planned targets.
3.14      Following resolution of questions relating to the housing mik and
housing unit sixe, housing sales perfirmance under both projects was
\satisfactory.'
Technical Assistance
3.15      The projects included technical assistance for:
(a)  Staff Trainin * On-the-job and overseas traini'pg for KLDC and KNUC
staff (aMd MqC staff under Lo4n 2216) in areas such as housing
finance, reat estate development and mnagement, engineering -and
constructions
(b)  Project PreEaration.  Feasi4ility studies and detailed engineering
for future projects;



K~~~~~~~~~
Cc) !!o4toring and Evaluation.  Survey and analysis to determine the'
efEtdctiveness of the land'development and housing activities
undertakenm; and
Cd)  Preagra!Aon of Sector Studies.
3.16      Staff training was carried out as envisioned.  Under both projects,
short-term study tours at foreign universities and institutions (including
Harvard) were provt.ded to a total of 94 NO;, [imc and KLD  staff members from
1982 to 1986.
3.17      Housing sector studies under both projects were carried out by the
Korea lkesearch Institute for Human Settlements (MRHS), with the help of
consultaats and local universities. Studies under bot1i projects were directed
at Government's sectorat policies regarding a broad r'ange of issues. The
Housing Policy Development Study finan ed undiqr Loan 1980 and issued in April
1983 incorporated systematic reviews oYS  issues and problems in the areas-~of
housing demandp\ housing finanes, urbai renewal,, the role of the private sector
in the provisio'n of housing, and 4ata manageamet problems in thei sector.'
Based on the study's recoumiedations, the Gover=nmet'formulated a rental
ho4sing policq~to directly address the housing problems of the poor and
improved its housing data system. Government staff also gained a clearer
understanding of the natuve of the housing shortage,probiem in coirea \
(particularly in urban areas), a greater focus on the affordability and cost
recovery aspects of public housings, and a better understanding of the role of
housing finance in making housing more affordable to the lower-income
population.
3o18'    Furtt er policy studies included in a gtudy on Housing Problems and. -
Policy Developti.nts in\Korea(su4iOcoe 1q85 and fin4nced under Loan
223A) considered the incentivs4snetve   fcretsector policies' and
rela'ted t?pics s%4 as "kenta  hosn   n   nryefficiency in housing
construct ion methodology. As a rissult of tbasp studi~st MtC~ was able to
formulate clearer, more efficiLent policies regarding rental dwel\lings and
housing taxation and finance. HOC's interest in these studies a*id the need to
improve its #pticymakinS capacity was indicated by its implementattion of a
comprehensive'training program for k*\y officials, and agencies involved in the
formulation and implementation of housing policy.
3.19      Studies carried out under the'\two projec-ts also raised the
Gov'ernment's awat?eSis of la~id development and housing finance as the major
remainings constraints in thes,,ector end led to the preparation of two
subsequent projects, the Urban Land bevelopment Project (Loan 2704-KG) in -1986
and the Heusing Finance Sector Project (Loan 2853-KG) in I 87.-The projects
therefore fulfilled the objecti-ve of strengthening the Isecror institutions to
a level where the Bank could suppor't pr\ojects on a programmatic basis.
D.Costs
3i~2O    The firs~ proJect had a total cost' of V 244billion or US$309.4 mil-
lions, which wag 572 higher than the appraisal estimate in terms of won
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



k~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ a
- 10 -
(W 156.1 billion)\'and 29% higher than estimated in US$ terms (US$240 mil-
lion).  Cost increases were mainly due to the increased scope of works and
additional costs for land acquisitioho KLDC developed f,2Z more land than
expected at appraisal, and 56% of the cost of this deveLopment represented
land acquisition. Despite the overall-increase in project costs, unit cost$
were lower than expected\tue to low bids from contractors due to intense
competition to obtain work dur'ng the period of recession and price
st4bilization. Thus, unit costs per pyung of land developed were 632 of the
estimate, while housing construction costs were 71X of the estimate.  Results
under the secobnd project were similar. The total project cost was W 302.4
billion (US$363.0 million), which was 29X higher than the appraisal estimate
in terms of wonw (W 233.8 billion) and 15% higher than the US$316.0 million
estimated at appraisal. At\the same time, the development area was 45%
\ \   greater than originally expected.  Unit costs were 85Z of the estimate for
land development and 67% of the estimate for housing consl uction.  A
comparison of estimated and actual costs is given in Annex 5.
E. Disbursement
3e21      Due to the economic slowdown in real 'estate in the ea4ly 1980s, the
increase in quWntitative targets under the project and implementation delays
(para. 3.12), disbursement of Loan 1980 was slower than Axpected-and loan
closing had to be extended by 18 months, from December 31, 1984 to June 30,
1986. At Government's request, US$14.66 millicdn of the lIan was cancelled in
Nay 1984 to reflect savings in housing construciion costs and another US$4.0
million was cancelled in March 1986. Loan 2216-KO also disbursed somewhat
more slowly than expected, although loan closing was extended\by oully six
months from September 30,a 1986 to March 31, 1987.  As expected, disbursement
of both loans wag faster t'han the disbursement profile. A comparison of the
planned and actual disbursement \of the loans is shown in Annex 6 and loan
disbursement by category is given in Annex 7.
F   Procurement
3.22     All civil works cozitracts under the project were carried out -
satisfactorily, folloving international competitive bidding (ICB)
procidures.  Despite TCB, all contracts were avarded to local firms since no
foreign firm*, participated in the prequalification process. ',
C. Reportin i
3.;3      Under both projects, quarterly reports covering the status qf
project implementation, procurement, sales, etc. were submitted regularly to
the Bank. The reports were of good quality, were provided kn time and allowed
close monitoring of project i"pleme;tmtion.  Annual project auditc reports were
prepared on a timely basis by independent aud.tors, satisfactory to the
Bank. Although an atdit of NWHF accounts which was required under Loan 2216
Vas not submitted, the requirement was filfilled by the auditing of UF's
accounts by the Government's B\oard of Inspection and Audit whose ;otmiets were
sent to the Bank.



H.  The Role of the Bank
3.24      The participation of the Bank in the identification and ireparation
of the projects reinforced and invoked policy shifts and technical innovations
in the public housing se'tor, especially for the low-income group.  In
a dition, the Bahk's involvement was responsible for initiating studies which
recommended measut,s to improve the housing sector further and prompted ;
changes in th, Government's subsequent policy\.
3.25      All components of the projects were supervised by the Asia Country
Department II Infrastructure Division (formerly called the  Urban and Water
Supply Division of the East Asia and Pacific'\Regional Office). During the
implementation of both projects, a total of 8 supervision missions'visited
Korea; an average of about 8 staff-weeks per year was spent ,in supervision -
efforts in the field. The quality of the working relationship between the
Bank and the implementing agencies was excellent through the life of the
projects.
IV.  INSTITUTIAL'S  AnD PERFOMANCi-
4.1       The Land Development and Housing,Project was carried out by KLDC and
KNHC, under the coordination of KOC's Housing Bureau (HEB), the agency chiefly
responsible for national housing policy and plans. A senior-level Liaison
Comiittge (called a coordination working gitoup under the first project)
chaired by the HS Direttor-Ceneral and includiqng representatives of the
implementing agencies\was directly responsible for coordination. KLDC was
responsible for acquiring and developing'the land, marketing the commercial
and residential areas, and ensuring that an adeqte supply of r4s"onably-
priced,q serviced land-was available for low-inci: needs.\ For projects \
ander.-aken through PMD, KLDC had sole responsibility for land development, for
LI projects, responsibility wasi shared with the respective city governmentse
SC iwa.s responsible for the construction and sale of housing for low-income
families. The land rSquired by KNHC was to be purchased from KLDC at cross-
subsidized prices. Iustitutiotal responsibilities under the second project
were *pimilar, although mortgages for low-incom* families were provided ,by the
Korea Housing Bank (KHB) under the first project, but-by NHF und   the 'second
project.
* 4.2 \ .Both KLDC and KNHC are government corporations operating under the
guidance of MOC, KHB is the principal goverhment \agency for extending housing
loans to house purchasers and is answerable to the Ministry of Finance.  NHF
was established in 1981 to facilitate the provislion of housi4ng finance for the
Governme=t's National Housing Construction Plan and particularly emphasizes
the ptovision of long-t\erm mortgages to the low- and middle-income popula-
tion. 'It is essintially an expanded vers4on of the National Housing,
ConstFruction Loan Program-started in 1973 and operated-by KHB, but ¶ separate
fund distinct fiom KHB. NHF is directly answerable to MOC which det'amines
its, overall policies on the advice of the HB Policy Division.  For adAinistra-
tive purposes, day-to-day management ot the Fund has been\delegated to the           -
' President of KHB and his designated staff.



- 12 -
4.3       Under the two projects* KLDC, KNHC 4n4 (under Loan 2216) NHF were
\strengthened through the provision of technical assistance and training.
Prior to the projects, KLDC (which was established only in 1979) relied
heavily on local consultants for project preparation and construction
supervision, and itself carried out' only planning and site selection. As a
result of the projectsp KLDC developed procedures for site evaluation and
selection based on financial and economic criteria, enhanced its project
supervision capabilities, began to develop a capacity to undertake project
feasibility studies, and strengthened its decision-making capacity, fi6ancial
management, corporate planning and data management capability, the latter
through computerisation. As a result, its reliat*ce on consultant assistance
decreased.
4.4       Project assistance to MHC, particularly with respect to monitoring
and evaluation, resulted in the introduction of various analytical procedures,
including a post-project implementation survey by iihich to evaluate project
effectiveness and impact.  In 1986b  KNEC surveyed\the households that had
benefitted from its construction program and used the collectod data in
planning subsequent projects and in reviewing ongoing works.
4.5       Coordination between KLDC and KNHC in the, selection of housing sites
ted the allocation of low-income areas within sites was not always satis-
factory and some sites developed by KLDC were not considered\marketable by
MNC. This was due to inherent differences in the roles of the two
organizations, one specializing in the development of land at the lowest co4t
possible and the other requiring sites for affordable, marketable low-income
housing. Part of this problem was also due t, the Liaison Committee's lack of
a clearly defined role and authority which would enable it to coordinat4
activities effectively. Undet Loaa.1980, 9 of the 13 sites developed by\.NIMC \
were provided by KLDC, and under Lo E 2216, 10 of th -12 sites were KLDC's.'
The remaining siteW dere developed by KNUC ituelk.  Despite the disagreements,
however, the Liaison Comaittee establi7shed under the projicts represented a
Valuable start to instituting a more effective working arrangement fot the two
agencies.
4.6       At appraisal, it had been envisaged that the then newly created NH'
would becomie a financially viable independent institution, with its own
project appraisal and supervision capabilities to' serve the public housing
programs.  Although NHF was nt deveiloped as an independent financial
intermediary, the Government has used it to -hannel public funds to lower-cost
housing in a manner which maintains NHF's financial viability.  The plan to
build an i; epenadent project appraisal and supervision capability in NHF was   \
not pursued sinie those services were provided on a fee basis by KHB. At the
outset, NHF's clientele vere not s4fficiently distinguished f6m thsae of the
market-oriented housing bank, KIB. However, the Government has gradually
lowered the maximum unit'size for NIF financing from 25.7 py to the present 18 py
while maintaining a higher limit of 30 py for KHB financing.  This has -
significantly i creased the targettitg of NHF funds to both pubelic and private
low-income housing projects.

V.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A.  Korea Land Development Corporation
5.1       As a newly established institution, KLDC's growth was impressive.
During 1981-85, its total assets grew by 33Z p.a- and xits profitability
improved (Table 2). At the same time, its current ratio, ieeo, the ratio of
current assets to current liabilities, declined from 1.62 in 1981 to 0.20 in
\1985 due to cash flow problems. In-1980s, KLDC raised funds by issuing non-
business debentures, with repayment-of principal and interest due five years
after issuance. Thereafter, KLDC generally had sufficient capital but faced
an acute shortage ot funds in 1985 when repayment was due. Its level of
.current assets also suffered in 1984-85 due to the sluggishness of land sales
during a recessionary period in real estate.. KLDC was, however,P able to
manage this problem.  During the project period, KLDC's profitability
increased in terms of both the ratio of operating revenu  to total assets and
the ratio of net income to capital, which averaged 0.24 and 0.10,
respectively, during 1981-85. Financial briefs for KLDC as well as the other
-implementing agencies are shown in Annex 8.

C.,, National Housing Fund
5.3 \    Since its inception in 1981, NSF's assets grew rapidly, quadrupling
to W 2,853 billion in 1986. During 1982-86, its assets increased by an
average 30.2% p.a.# peaking in 1984 when ther\grew by 56.8%. NHF's capital
base is derived from government contributions, retained earnings, lottery
profits and other lesser sources. Its capital base is particularly important
since NHF's assets are almost entirely 20-year graduatea payment mortgage\
loans9,while its major sources\of funds such as bonds and savings deposits
have maturities\of five yetro or tess and represent nearly 80X of total
liabilities.  The average ratio ofJlong-term liability to capital averaged
14.6 during 1982-85, but dropped to 8.68 in 1986 when the Government increased
its contribution to the Fund by Won\ 100 billion (Table 4)..

\5.4      While Loan 2216 helped to improve NHF's financial position by bei4g
a long-term borrowing with repayment over 15 years, the loan provided only 2%
of NHF's total funds.  But with low-cost sources of funds, particularly
housing bonds which paid 3-5% interest p.a., and 89% of its portfolio
comprised of housing loans, ielding 1Q'p.a., NHF has had a positive spread,
averaging 18%. since 1981.  Overall, NHF was able to improve its profitability
during the project period.                             \
*}   D. Cost Recovery and Affordability
5.5       The actual cost of land development was reccVered by KLDC, which
sold the commercial and uiddle-  ncome residential plots at market prices which

cross-subsidised land sold to K MC for low-income housing.  The cost of
housing construction was also fully reflected in house prices and was
recovered from the home buyers.
5.6       Project housing and land for public facilities were sold at cost.
Housing mortgages were issued upon receipt of a 352 downpayment (402 under the
second project) from the low-income house purchasers, with the balance to be
paid ~ver 20 years at the prevailing KHB or.MHF interest rate for low-income
house purchases, This rate was 15.52 when the first project was appraised and
102 when the second project was appraised.  House prices were based on the
assumption that\families in the target group could afford tv spend about 302
of their monthly income on housing, excluding utilities and taxes. Using this
criterion and the urban household income distribution shown in Annex 9, KNUC
estimates that 492 of the housing units constructed under Loan 1980 were
affordable to families below the 19th percentile; 34g to the 20th to 29th
percentiles; and 17% to the 30th'39th percentiles.  The project may therefore
have reached much further down in the income distribution thin originally
expected. As indicated in Table 5, the same held true for the second
project.

VIT   ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
A.'. Original Estimate
ia        The principal justification for the p4ojects was in terms of it4eir
ability to ameliorate the housing shortage in the project cities, to provide
employment opportunities in the construction sector and to strengthen
institutions in the housing sector.  At appraisal, the imputed reptal values
of the dwellings\to be consttucted in the varidds cities'and the eitimated
market values of the serviced commercial and open market land were used to
measure the benefits of the projects.' Estimates 9f ren;al values vere based
on current rents charged by KUC and the private sectorVfor similar housin;
units in the project,cities.  Zstimases of land values *ere based on-market
surveys conducted in,1981 by land ass'essors of adjacent parcels of land
similar to the sites to be deve4oped.  Land and'development, infrastructure,
housing and recurrent (maintenaice) copts were considered in the analysis,
-A~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



-16^
with all ceaxe  exeluded. Shadow prices, applicable only to unskilled labor
which constituted a miipor fraction of total construction costa, were judged
not to have a major imoact on the rates of return and hence were not
considredo The appraised economic rates of return (ERR) were 16.52 for the
first project, and 12.52 for the second project   The considerable difference
in the ERRs betwee  projects was largely attrib;table to a continuing rise in
land developmt and housing construction costs and virtual stanation in
sales prices of land and housing.
R. Re-evaluation
6.2       The re-evaluated ERRs are X4.2Z for the first project and 22.4X for
the second project.  Details of the re-evaluation are given in Ann   10.  The
SER recalculation was based on a comparison of the actual cost of providing
the project housing and the market value of that housing as assessed at the
end of 19879 discounted to the time of completion using housing inflation
data. Perhaps more significant than the ERRs themselves is the variation
among the re-evaluated ERRs for each specific site,, which is such greater than
the estimated variation (Table 6). This is probably due to "he majov\effect
of location on the market value of a house, buttressed to some etent by the
particular conditions prevail4ng when the market value was assessed.  Thus the
re-evaluated gRRs reflect actual experience rather than the more aggregated
masures used to compute a priori ERRs.

WEI. CONCLUSIONS AMD LESSONS LEARNED
A.' Conclusions
7.1       The objectivea of both projects were to increase KLDC's capacity to
carry out large-scale site development and to enable KNC io construct housing
for the low-income population. To this end, MLDC developed sites covering a
total of about 4.6 million py, sabstantially exceeding the original target,
and XMlC supplied 18,744 housing units to the lower level of the targeted
income group living in small and medium cities throughout the country.
Project-supported housing comprised 3.41 of the 549,000 units constructed by
the public sector during the Fifth Five-Year Plan period (1982-86) and
contributed to the more baianied development Qf the regions ad easing of the
housing shortage     *
742       ^9As a result of exprience gained under the projects, the executing
'agencies ars uo  capable of hand1lig programmtie  t     opertions which allow
thm more fleibility in implementation. Thus, KLC i tnow implmenting the
Urban Lea Developmnt Project (Loan 2704-£D) covering about 1.2 miiillion p'
ad Is  is {ivolved in the lousing Finance Sector Project (Loan 2853-KO) to
support the provision of longtetm financing for the sector. Therefore, the
project can be considered a success both in t e2m of the physical implementa-
tion and the Institutional and policy development goals set forth.
S. Lessos 'Learned
7.3       The following lessons were learned under the project:
(a) ver specific implementation guidelines and standards are
unnecessary and may even be counterproductive when the executing
'agencies have deloped adequate capabilities for thF tasks at
hand. In these projects, specifications for tho housing mix ad
uni size were owvrly strict and caused delays to implementation
A          while KNIC carried out studies to substantiate its request for
changQoe Thus, when dealing with experienced agencies like KLDC and
KNIC, sector rather than project loans may be advisable;
(b) strong motivation is important to the ;uccess of implementation, as
evidenced by KLDC whose firm commitment to developing its capacities
led it to significantly surpass its project targets;
. A
(c) now concepts io project design should be introduced only after local
circumtances are studie# ~pd found suitable. The concept of
e_pandable core housirs which had proved successful in other
countries was not full;y tested in Korea prior to project
impl tation and proved unacceptables and
(d)  responsibilities uunder a project 'should  e clearly delineated,  Due
to.vagu descriptions of project coordinating responsibilities and
decisiont-maing authority, coordination by the projects' Liaison
Committees mas not always successful.                              .
