F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The objective of the program was to support the comprehensive structural reforms which
respond to two major challenges: (i) the “triple trade shock? of trade preference erosion and high
oil prices and (ii) the transition from low wage, low skill sugar and apparel exporter to
innovative, knowledge and skill based services economy. The reform program was anchored on
four pillars: (i) consolidating fiscal performance and improving public sector efficiency; (ii)
improving trade competitiveness; (iii) improving the investment climate; and (iv) democratizing
the economy through participation, social inclusion and sustainability.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design:

1.      This Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) is prepared following the
completion of the first Development Policy Loan (DPL) programmatic series in Mauritius. The
objectives of this series were to support the country to transit from an economy which benefited
from decades of preference agreements for its trade activities to one in which the firms were to
face more competition, and to transit from a low skill highly concentrated economy to a more
innovative service based economy. To achieve these objectives, the Government of Mauritius
implemented a program of structural reforms which was bold and covered a wide range of areas.
This program was strongly owned by the Government at the highest level and the commitment to
make the right changes, at times even politically sensitive, was strong. The program itself was
build based on rigorous analytical work. The reform program has been very successful as
measures by two factors: (i) the resilience of the economy during the crisis of 2008, and (ii) the
attainment of most of the targets on indicators identified to measure success.

2.      The results of the reform program have been impressive, even at a very early stage in
the process. Substantial progress was already achieved in just two years of reforms. By 2008,
for example, debt to GDP ratio already fell to 53.7 percent (from 68.8 in 2006), primary
spending 20.2 percent (from 21.6 in 2006), unemployment rate 7.2 percent (from 9.5 in 2006),
the number of days to start a business was 6 (from 46 in 2006), and tourist arrivals 0.93 million
(from 0.78 in 2006). When the financial crisis set in 2008, some of the measure had to be relaxed
in order to address the short-term concerns and to stimulate the economy, but commitment for
refrom and progress was sustained throughout the operation.

3.      The response to the crisis was targeted and time-bound. As a result of structural reforms
introduced since 2006 Mauritius entered the global crisis with strong fundamentals. In fact, the
fiscal space created due to the reform process until 2008 improved the economy‟s resilience to
better absorb the impact of the shock. The package of measures that were implemented to
counter the impact of the global crisis and to support in stimulating the economy was
comprehensive and innovative. The fiscal stimulus (around 5 percent of GDP) were primarily
focused to accelerate infrastructure investment projects crucial for long-term economic growth,
and to facilitate restructuring of firms to improve their competitiveness and at the same time
preserve jobs and improve capacity. Institutions were put in place (for example a project plan
committee) to ensure that only investments that have a satisfactory rate of return, and fast-
tracking and front loading public investments. To deal with capacity constraints, schemes were
put in place to facilitate recruitment of local/international expertise in specific areas to assist the
government in formulation, design and evaluation of projects and programs. Microeconomic
interventions targeting firms and protecting vulnerable employees were introduced. In this
context, an innovative initiative called the Mechanism for Transitional Support to Private Sector
(MTSP) was introduced. In the MTSP, the Government became an equity partner to guarantee
survival of, otherwise sound firms, facing severe distress during the crisis. However, the
Government would only intervene if the Banks and shareholders were jointly willing to finance
60 percent of the restructuring costs, thus ensuring only market conforming intervention.
Coordination between monetary policy loosening and fiscal policy stimulus was timely and well
calibrated. The floating exchange rate regime also played an important role as a shock absorber,
contributing directly to the balance of payments sustainability. Overall, a high quality

                                                  13
macroeconomic policy framework effectively helped to sustain stability and avoid derailment of
achievements. The response to the crisis, of course, resulted in easing, to some extent, the fiscal
consolidation component of the reform program.

4.      The momentum of the reform program has been maintained even after the crisis. The
experience of improving the resilience of the economy during the crisis due to the reforms
undertaken until 2008 was in itself a motivating factor to continue the implementation of the
reform agenda. The authorities ascertained that they were on the right track and were determined
to continue the implementation of the reform program. This is evident from the results
framework of the DPO project. Despite some of the indicators fell off-track during the crisis
period, yet they have been brought on track after the crisis and most of them have been achieved.
For example, the debt to GDP ratio which increased to 60.2 percent in 2009 is back on a
declining trend and stood at 57.5 percent in December 2011, and tourist arrivals which fell to
0.87 million in 2009 is consistently increasing and reached 0.96 million in 2011.

5.     This programmatic series closely supported the Government in its policy reform
agenda. This programmatic series has been used as a vehicle to harmonizing policy dialogue of
development partners with the Government and has also served as a mechanism to ensure
coordination among development partners in the country. This series was also flexible in
responding to the needs of the country. Initially this series consisted of three operations for an
amount of USD 90 million (USD 30 million each). However, to respond to the additional fiscal
challenges of the client in order to cushion the impact of the unexpected financial crisis of 2008,
the Bank increased the amount for the third operation to USD 100 million and introduced in the
operation a Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO). A fourth operation, of USD 50 million, was also
added to this series to continue supporting the reform agenda, since election was due in a year‟s
time and it would not have been the right timing to start a new series. This programmatic series
ended up with four operations for a total amount of USD 210 million.

6.      The objectives set out for this series has been broadly achieved. Mauritius indeed
transitioned from a low wage, low skill economy to an innovative and skill based economy. For
example, the country experienced a high real growth rate for the ICT sector (above 13 percent in
2009 and 2010). The value added of the ICT sector in 2010 was 14.1 percent higher than in
2009. Exports of ICT goods, including re-export rose by 68.1 percent in 2010 and exports of ICT
services increased by 21.6 percent in the same year. Employment in the ICT sector increased by
3.7 percent in 2010. The ICT Development Index (IDI) which measures countries‟ progress
towards becoming information societies improved to 4.03 in 2010 from 3.83 in 2009, and
Mauritius is ranked second among African countries after Seychelles. From 2001 to 2011, while
labor input for the whole economy grew by an average of 1.3 percent annually, labor
productivity grew by 3.0 percent. While attribution is not only linked to the reform program, yet
this denotes that the economy is becoming more skilled and productive. Employment in higher
skilled jobs (financial intermediation, education, health and real estate and business activities)
has increased by 2.5 percent between 2010 and 2011.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

7.      Mauritius had achieved important economic success since independence in 1968, but
positive outcomes could not be sustained. Mauritius grew at a yearly average of 5 percent (6
percent between 1980 and 1990) causing GDP per capita to rise substantially from 48 percent of
the world average in 1980 to 78 percent of world average in 2004. This impressive achievement
was possible largely due to the opportunistic use of preferential trade agreements for sugar and
textiles, sound institutions to ensure growth and redistribution, and prudent macroeconomic
management. However, the positive outcomes could not be sustained, and growth rate deviated
downwards. In 2005, economic outlook became somber and the pessimism increased in the wake
of the phasing out of the Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA) for textiles (December 2004), the
gradual decline of the EU guaranteed price of sugar (starting 2006), and the sharp rises in oil and
food prices at that time. These three factors are combined together as the „triple trade shock‟ in
the PDO.

8.      At appraisal for the first operation, macroeconomic indicators were worrisome. Budget
deficit was 5 percent and increasing. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) noted that if public
enterprise deficit and cash interest payments on an accrual basis is accounted for, then the overall
fiscal deficit is in fact 6.6 percent of GDP for 2004/05 and not 5 percent. Unemployment rate
was 9 percent, its highest level in 20 years, inflation was 11 percent, FDI declined 1.5 percent of
GDP, and public debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 72 percent at the end of June 2005, up from 55
percent in 1995. The Fund noted that a real GDP growth of about 3 percent would worsen the
fiscal deficit (widen to around 7 percent) over time and public sector debt would become
unsustainable. External accounts deteriorated. Current account deteriorated, following increased
trade deficit (fall in textiles exports coupled with increased import bill as fuel prices hiked) and
this led to a drop in the net official foreign reserves (from 7.5 months on imports in 2003/04 to
less than 5 months of imports in 2005/06) and depreciation of the real effective exchange rate
(3.8 percent in 2003/04 and 6 percent in 2004/05). The authorities, by the end of 2004 started a
comprehensive structural reform program to diversify the economy and enhance competitiveness
to maintain high growth rates. The team‟s assessment of the macroeconomic policy framework at
the start of each operation was sound and realistic, and this helped responding to the needs of the
client.

9.      Economic reforms accelerated when a new government took office in 2005 and
recognized the need for fundamental reforms to boost competitiveness and to ensure fiscal
sustainability over the medium term. The Government elected in 2005 maintained substantial
policy continuity but accelerated the on-going reform process, which were in line with the
National Long-Term Perspective Study (NLTPS). The goal was to diversify the economy by
moving towards high value-added, skill and knowledge intensive service sectors, with explicit
reference to the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. In 2006, the
implementation of a bold package of policies and institutional reforms started. It deepened many
of the efforts initiated in the preceding years and it aimed at addressing some politically-sensitive
reforms as well, like reduction in custom tariffs and linking wage increase to productivity. The
reform program was informed by the Aid for Trade Report in 2006 that the Government
prepared with the support of the Bank.


                                                 15
10.     The programmatic DPL series was the right vehicle to respond to the reform program
set out by the Government. It provided both financial assistance and technical assistance to the
Government to undertake its reform program, and had in-built flexibility. This DPL series
completely aligned with the priorities of the Government. These priorities are outlined in the
Government‟s budget speeches and the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2007-20131. The
CPS stressed that the challenge for Mauritius was to boost economic growth through higher
productivity; develop human capital through education and labor market reforms; promote new
emerging sectors and develop a knowledge based economy, while preserving its long standing
commitment to social welfare. The CPS objective was to help the Government deal with short-
term trade shocks and the transition to a more competitive and sophisticated economy, while
minimizing negative social impacts. The Government was consistent in its long term policy
objective throughout the series. Technical assistance was provided in a number of areas to
support implementation of policy decisions. For example, in the area of fiscal consolidation, the
WB Treasury provided assistance to the Bank of Mauritius (BOM) and the Ministry of Finance
and Economic Development (MOFED) to jointly develop an action plan for improving Public
Debt Management, and also provided training workshops which proved helpful in strengthening
the relationship with key counterparts and advancing this agenda. Due to its flexibility, at the
time of the crisis in 2008, this series responded rapidly to the needs of the authorities.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators:

11.    The objective of the program was to support the comprehensive structural reforms
which respond to two major challenges: (i) the “triple trade shock? of trade preference erosion
and high oil prices and (ii) the transition from low wage, low skill sugar and apparel exporter to
innovative, knowledge and skill based services economy. The reform program was anchored on
four pillars: (i) consolidating fiscal performance and improving public sector efficiency; (ii)
improving trade competitiveness; (iii) improving the investment climate; and (iv) democratizing
the economy through participation, social inclusion and sustainability.


1.3. Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification:

12.        The development objective was not revised during the series.

1.4. Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

13.     Policy area I, Consolidating fiscal performance and improving public sector efficiency:
In 2005/06, debt to GDP ratio already exceeded prudent levels, at 69.2 percentage of GDP. The
IMF has warned the authority of significant risks to the outlook and urged the authorities to make
bigger and faster adjustments in 2006/07. The IMF projected that with adverse developments in
growth and world interest rates, a no-adjustment situation could quickly get out of control
increasing debt to 112.3 percent of GDP. Demands on the state for discipline, strategic resource
allocation and economic restructuring increased. The government self-imposed fiscal rules in the
budget of 2006/07. These rules included the following (i) that Government should borrow only
for investment and not for recurrent expenditure, and (ii) that public debt to GDP should decline.
1
    The CPS progress report prepared in 2011 extended the CPS period to 2015.

                                                         16
To attain these objectives, the MOFED set up Sector Ministry Support Teams (SMSTs) to
coordinate budget preparation with sector ministries in line with the self-imposed rules. The goal
was to help sector ministries improve allocative efficiency in expenditure. The Government
program aimed at: (i) stabilizing total revenue at above 19 percent of GDP and (ii) reducing re-
current expenditure.

14.     The DPL series supported a number of policy changes in these areas. On the revenue
side, the program supported the Government to adopt policies to reduce distortions and increase
equity in the tax code, relinquishing discretionary powers to grant tax and duty exemptions and
operationalizing the Mauritius Revenue Authority (MRA)2. On the expenditure side, the program
supported the Government to adopt a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), to
implement Program Based Budgeting (PBB) in order to increase predictability of resource
envelopes for planning purposes, to align the chart of accounts of the Treasury accounting
system to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001, to upgrade the Borrower‟s financial
management information system to enable budget implementation and reporting of financial and
non-financial data, and to prepare sector strategies in line with PBB requirements.

15.    Policy area II, Enhancing trade competitiveness: Mauritius faced ineffective regulation,
anti-export biased policy distortions, red tape and discretionary interventions, which impacted
negatively on trade competitiveness thereby impeding flow of resources to growth sectors.
Incentives in place were geared more toward production for domestic markets than exports,
product and process innovations were not encouraged and policies to deal with the constraints of
Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) were not priorities. The reform agenda put in place by the
government addresses these problems by revamping incentives, eliminating the distinction
between Export Processing Zone (EPZ) and non-EPZ firms, tariff liberalization, eliminating
investment tax credit, and lightening regulatory burdens.

16.     The DPL series supported a number of reforms under this component. DPL1 and DPL2
focused on reducing the cost of international connectivity and increasing capacity, and DPL2
also called for a review of telecommunications regulation3. Informed policy dialogue in the area
of competitiveness and regulatory framework was enhanced following the Bank‟s Economic
Sector Work (ESW), which identified a number of inappropriate non-tariff trade-related
regulations and implementation, bottlenecks which compromise competitiveness in Mauritius.
Strong Government interest on the subject nurtured a productive policy dialogue and set-up of a
permanent regulatory review committee, as recommended. To support these policies, some of the
prior actions that the DPL series followed up are: acquisition of additional capacity on the South
African Far East Cable (SAFE) cable by Mauritius Telecom, issuing of decision by Information
and Communication Technologies Authority of Mauritius (ICTA) on Mauritius Telecom‟s

2
  The MRA‟s legal basis dates from 2004, but it became fully operational only in July 2006 with new premises, a
full complement of professional staff having their own scheme of service, and equipped with a clear mandate and a
modern client focus
3
  Regulatory challenges have centered on balancing the interests of the incumbent, Mauritius Telecom, with other
competitors in the sector, especially MT‟s exclusive control over the landing point for international communications
and participation in the SAFE consortium. Good practice thinking on regulation has evolved considerably since
2001 when the ICTA was established under the Telecommunications Act, shifting away from licensing entry to
promoting efficient market outcomes.


                                                        17
application for 20 percent price reduction on asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) charges,
initiation of regulatory review of ICTA, continue implementation of the duty free island policy
by significantly reducing average tariff rate and number of top rated tariff lines and establishing
a joint Public-Private Sector Standing Committee to review the design and implementation of
regulatory measures relative to import and export licenses with a view to eliminate unwarranted
barriers to trade.

17.     Policy area III, Improving the investment climate: A number of constraints inhibited
investment to the country. Some of these constraints were: shortage of human capital, rigidity in
regulation on entry of foreign workers, inflexible labor market, linking wage setting to
productivity rather than index-linked and poor port and road infrastructure. The Government
embarked on reforms to eliminate bureaucratic obstacles. The Registrar of Companies was
designated as a one stop focal agency for business registration and the Board of Investment
(BOI) converted from being an administrator of programs to a facilitator and promoter. Whereas
firms previously had to obtain ex-ante fire and health certificates to start operations, new rules
were set up for ex-post verification of adherence to published guidelines. Other measures include
merging development and building permits, easing entry of foreign workers by combining
residence and work permits into a single occupation permit and tying wages more closely to
productivity by replacing the tripartite wage setting mechanism with a National Pay Council
(NPC). In addition, land administration and management was being modernized with the
introduction of a cadastre system and establishment of transparent and predictable procedures for
transfers of ownership and usage.

18.    The DPL series supported various components toward improving investment climate.
In March 2004, the Bank submitted the “Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC) of Insolvency and Creditor Rights Systems for Mauritius? and made recommendations
on how to improve the statutory insolvency framework in Mauritius. Other areas of support
included the establishment and operationalization of a new wage negotiating mechanism,
introduction of a flexi-security scheme, and the appointment of the Competition Commission of
Mauritius.

19.     Policy area IV, Democratizing the economy through participation, social inclusion and
sustainability. The objectives are to make better use of available human resources, create job
opportunities, empowering people through active labor market programs, and providing adequate
social safety nets for the vulnerable. In this context, an Empowerment program was incorporated
for the following purposes/ activities: (i) land for social housing; (ii) land for small
entrepreneurs; (iii) a workfare program emphasizing training and re-skilling; (iv) special
programs for unemployed women; (v) tourist villages; (vi) assistance for outsourcing; and (vii)
support for development of new entrepreneurs and SMEs. Government also embarked on
reforms of the administration of social safety nets to strengthen financial viability and focus
support on the truly needy and emphasis was also laid on increasing access to education and
(re)training.

20.     In this pillar, the DPL series supported the expanding opportunities through education,
empowerment of people to increase their employability and better targeting of the needy. The
prior actions in the series were: (i) drafting of national education strategy to increase primary,

                                                18
secondary and tertiary levels and raise quality, (ii) preparation and submission to Cabinet of a
draft Education and Human Resources Strategy Plan and implementation of a targeted and
temporary policy action in the form of a work and training scheme, and (iii) production of a
poverty map with the objective of improving the capacity for geographical targeting.

1.5. Revised Policy Areas:

21.     Policy areas were not revised.

1.6. Other significant changes:

22.     During the crisis in 2008, the Bank responded quickly to meet the needs of the country.
The initial plan was a programmatic series of three operations of USD 30 million each.
However, during the global financial crisis when the economic outlook was uncertain, the
country has serious concerns over declining revenues and the authorities needed to insure against
the negative impact of the crisis. The Bank responded and provided an increase of US$70 million
equivalent for the third operation as a self-insurance to adapt and protect against disruption to the
reform program. To allow for greater flexibility in responding to mounting uncertainties, the
operation was converted into a DDO operation and the credit was approved on a more favorable
term which included the elimination of the commitment fee. Although the request from the
authorities was higher than USD 100 million for DPL3, the Bank determined that given the
exposure limits for Mauritius and the then existing volume of loans outstanding, the DDO would
have to be limited to US$100 million.

23.     A fourth operation (DPL4) was added to the program. During the preparation of DPL3,
the Government requested for a new series of DPOs to support in the continuation of reforms.
However, to keep in step with the electoral cycle it was agreed to add one operation, DPL4, to
the series and to begin a new programmatic series in FY11. The Bank provided a further US$50
million in funding through DPL4, and this was well coordinated with other development partners
to close potential sizeable funding gap if the crisis continued to worsen. This amount was
matched by Euros 40 million of funding from AFD directed at support for projects meeting the
criterion of environmental sustainability. African Development Bank (AfDB), which was also
preparing a DPO series decided to make US$700 million available to Mauritius in three tranches
and the EU also scaled up its assistance through additional grants. DPL4 included joint missions
with all the development partners and development of common results framework with the
African Development Bank.


2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance:

24.     The DPL series aligned with the priorities of the Government’s reform agenda. (The
four pillars are mentioned in section 1.2). The subsequent operations build on the previous ones
and the prior actions followed an incremental sequencing path to push the reforms deeper. Since
the program based budgeting (PBB) was formally introduced in 2008/09, this series made use of
some of the country‟s own indicators and targets to measure success and achievements.

                   opportunities to the
                   poorest


25.     Flexibility was instilled in the series to increase effectiveness. The third operation in the
series was prepared with DDO and with an increase in the amount of the operation to respond to

                                                               22
the Government needs in light of the financial crisis and its associated uncertain outlook at that
time (sees section 1.6). Even during the global crisis in 2008, momentum for reforms remained
high. The reforms implemented in the first two operations of the series provided the fiscal space
to surmount the fiscal challenges that the crisis created. The authorities realized the benefits of
the reforms implemented and therefore continued implementation of the reform program.

26.     Partnership with other development partners (DPs) was important to reduce
transaction costs by the authorities. There are a limited number of development partners that
operate in Mauritius. These are the European Commission (EC), the World Bank (WB), the
African Development Bank (AfDB) and the United Nation Development Program (UNDP).
Except the AfDB, the other three DPs have an office in Mauritius. The AfDB opened an office
after the end of this program. Donor coordination was very effective; all donors participated in
the DPO missions and were attending several meetings, especially in the areas that they were
also engaged. This was very helpful both for the donor community as well as the Government.
In fact the Government requested that mission around the DPO should be conducted jointly with
the DPs to reduce Government‟s transaction costs but also to ensure that there are no duplication.
DPs were also conducting donor meetings to share views and identify joint working areas. The
Government highly values the DPL operations as a vehicle for coordination on policy dialogue
among all stakeholders involved. During the DPL4 preparation, AfDB and the WB worked
closely in preparing their respective operations.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

27.    A number of factors contributed to the successful implementation and outcome of the
programmatic series. These include: (i) adequacy of Government‟s commitment, (ii) soundness
of background analysis, (iii) assessment of the operation‟s design, and (iv) risks identified at
appraisal stage and effectiveness of mitigation measures.

28.     Adequacy of Government’s commitment: Commitment to economic reform was
expressed at the highest level by the President of the Republic during his address to the nation in
July 2005 (President‟s address: Government Programme 2005-2010), by the Finance Minister‟s
statement to Parliament, Setting the Stage for Robust Growth in August 2005), and the budget
speech of FY 2006/07 in June 2006. The reform program was strongly owned by the
Government and the Ministry of Finance was the champion leading the reform process. The
areas for reform were set out by the Government and it was highly committed to attain its
objective. The reform agenda had the political backing at the highest level, and consultations
with stakeholders were quite thorough. The private sector and the public sector were both
formally and informally meeting to discuss relevance of policy changes. Government‟s
ownership throughout this series grew as the Government officials gained more capacity and
build confidence to discuss on policy changes with the Bank and understood the necessity for
these reforms.

29.    Operations based on sound analytical work: The DPL series was designed on the basis
of the analytical work undertaken prior to the preparation of the first operation and other
Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAAs) undertaken during the implementation of subsequent
operations. The program largely benefitted from the Bank‟s technical assistance in parallel with

                                                23
analytical work. The main underpinning analytical study which informed the reform program is
the Aid for Trade piece that the Bank completed in 2006. Throughout the series, the operations
benefitted from the Investment Climate Assessment in 2009, a study on the social protection
system of the country, a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Review in 2007 and
work on private sector development by the annual Doing Business Surveys. In addition, the
operations benefited from other works undertaken by other DPs and the IMF, in particular the
various Article IV documents, and the African Economic Outlook. During the last operation, the
Bank conducted an ESW on trade and labor4 to gather more knowledge which has been used to
inform policy reforms in the area of competitiveness for a subsequent programmatic series of
new DPLs. These knowledge products, in addition to those done by others provided analytical
background for the design of the different operations.

30.     Assessment of the operation’s design: The program aligned to the priorities of the
Government, and covered a wide range of reform areas. The implementation of the reform
program required buy-in from a number of actors, several agencies/ institutions/ ministries, some
of which had weak implementation capacity. During the design phase, areas where
implementation capacity was limited were identified and technical assistance was provided either
by the Bank or through partnerships with other development partners. Based on past experience
(see section 5.1) the first operation of the series was designed in such a way that the actions were
in themselves of standalone strategic importance but were concurrently connected to the
remaining operations. These areas were mainly debt management, Public Financial Management
(PFM) and trade competitiveness. The DPs ensured effectiveness of their engagements, avoided
duplication, and limited transaction costs to the authorities. The DPO programmatic series
provided a platform for DPs to coordinate their support to the Government. Joint missions
(identification, preparation and appraisal) carried out with other DPs have been instrumental in
harmonizing the donor community around the Government‟s program. The Government highly
values the DPL operations as a vehicle for coordination on policy dialogue among all
stakeholders involved. The DPL and parallel financing from other DPs have supplied around a
quarter of the public sector borrowing requirement over the period.

31.     Risks identified at appraisal stage and effectiveness of mitigation measures: Three risks
were identified during the appraisal stage of the operations and mitigating measures were
proposed. These were related to the ability of the Government to keep up the momentum of the
reforms, maintaining of the macroeconomic stability and capacity constraints. Because the
reform agenda included some policy changes that would affect and be unpopular with some
segments of the population, and given the knowledge that eliminating subsidies and targeting of
pension payments to only the needy have proved unacceptable in the past, the team identified
that the authorities may slip off track for some of the politically sensitive reforms. However, this
risk would be mitigated since the Government‟s priority pillars included the democratizing of the
economy and adopted an Empowerment Program to enhance opportunities and protect the
vulnerable groups who are at risks from changes taking place. The mitigating factors worked.

32.    Maintaining macro stability was identified as a risk as poor debt management policy
was a concern. For the last two operations, the risk of instability of the macroeconomic situation

4
 Although the ESW was completed after DPL4 declared effectiveness, yet the recommendations were adopted
during the preparation of the operation.

                                                    24
was higher due to the fiscal and balance of payments effects of the financial crisis. However, this
risk of macroeconomic instability was mitigated by the Government‟s continuing commitment
and leadership to a sound medium term economic framework, capacity building in debt
management, Government‟s cognizance of the importance of a sustainable and good quality
fiscal response as demonstrated by its fiscal measures and the operation of an exchange rate
policy conducive to external adjustment. The Bank, as well as other DPs, scaled up their
operations. Despite the effects of the global financial crisis, macroeconomic stability was
maintained.

33.     Capacity constraints were identified as major risk in all the operations. This included
both lack of high technical skills in some areas and lack of human resource in some other areas
to implement the reform program. To mitigate this risk, initiatives such as Service to Mauritius,
Capacity Building program or redeployment from public enterprises were also being undertaken
by the authorities. The donor community supported substantially with technical assistance. For
example, the UNDP and IMF provided technical assistance to modernize the budget process
through adoption of a MTEF and PBB. A key PBB requirement was the development of sector
strategic plans, and this was supported by the Bank. To improve the capacity for geographic
targeting of the poor, as part of the support in the „democratizing the economy‟ pillar, there was
a need for a poverty map to be developed by the Central Statistical Office. Since the statistical
office had limited capacity to undertake such an activity, the UNDP provided support for the
construction of a Social Registry containing information on beneficiaries of social programs in
Mauritius. The EC has supported the setting up of a poverty observatory in Mauritius to monitor
the effectiveness of poverty alleviation policies and to produce high frequency information for
policy makers through the use of qualitative methodologies. This technical assistance was timely
and well coordinated with the Bank which helped to providing advice towards rationalization of
social programs and identifies short/medium-run actions that could generate efficiency and
financial gains.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
The PDO were clear since the beginning of the program and this helped in the designing process
of the M&E parameters to follow up on the achievements of the objectives.

34.      M&E Design: The results matrix highlighted the linkages between policy actions and
expected outcomes for each of the four main priority area of the Government. This matrix was
prepared jointly by the Government (involving sector ministries), the Bank and to some extent
other DPs. The results matrix of the first operation included target values for some of the
monitoring indicator and in DPL2, the results framework was updated to assigned target values
to all the indicators. At the time of the crisis, the program document reflected well the potential
economic impact and highlighted that the impact may negatively affect some of the targets set in
the monitoring indicators. There were four indicators mentioned in the program document but
which were not linked to any policy actions and were not mapped to any of the four different
pillars of the series. These indicators are: GDP growth, unemployment rate, total number
employed (000) and FDI as a percentage of GDP. Since these indicators were not linked to the
policy changes supported by this series, they have not been assessed.




                                                25
35.     M&E Implementation: The data used for M&E purposes were all official data collected
from the Central Statistical Office, sector ministries of the Government, principally MOFED and
the central bank. Data from these institutions are highly reliable and very up to date and
disseminate data on a timely basis – monthly, quarterly and yearly. For the pillar on widening the
circle of opportunities, there was a need to gather data to measure low frequency event of
absolute poverty and in this context the UNDP provided technical assistance to the statistical
office to conduct a Survey of Living Conditions (SLC). To better monitor poverty parameters,
the statistical office lacked capacity. The Bank provided assistance to building capacity at the
CSO for production of poverty maps so that the institution can develop necessary tools to
monitor poverty. The assistance from the Bank and UNDP further improved capacity for the
local institutions to produce reliable and frequent data on important factors.

36.    M&E Utilization: During the design stage of subsequent operations, the Bank and
Government teams would go through the monitoring indicators to assess progress made and
whether the results show large deviations from expected and targeted outcomes. During the
preparation of this ICR, the team did not have any difficulty in gathering data required to fill out
the indicators table, except for one indicator for which data is no longer kept – percentage of
mentored SME firms that shows increase in profitability.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

37.     Following the successful completion of the programmatic series, the Government
requested two subsequent DPL programmatic series – one focusing on public sector
competitiveness and other focusing on private sector development. The public sector
competitiveness series builds on dialogue that the first programmatic series initiated on civil
service reforms, public enterprise reforms and trade competitiveness. This series focuses more
specifically on: (i) social protection reform, (ii) public enterprise and parastatal reform, (iii) civil
service reform, (iv) raising competitiveness (trade), (v) improve social sector delivery (education
and health). The private sector development programmatic series is a sector budget support that
draws on the policy and institutional dialogue that underpinned two investment lending
operations that were cancelled. The series focus on (i) enhancing competitiveness through skills
development and technology up-gradation; (ii) access to finance and regulatory reform for SME
growth; and (iii) ICT and e-Government support for increased efficiency and transparency gains.
The first operation of both series were presented to the Board in March 2012.


3.   Assessment of Outcomes

     Overall rating: Highly Satisfactory

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation:

     Rating for relevance of Objective: Highly Satisfactory
     Rating for relevance of Design: Satisfactory
     Rating for relevance of Implementation: Highly Satisfactory


                                                  26
38.    This relevance of the program is rated highly satisfactory. It reflects proper diagnosis of
development priorities that remains relevant at the time of the ICR. The program was flexible
and responded quickly to the needs of the client during the global crisis.

39.     Objectives: The program‟s objectives (as set out in section 1.2) have been broadly
achieved and remain relevant in the current country context. The objectives set in this series are
still consistent with the objectives of the Mauritius‟s reform program, as set out in the
Presidential Address to the Nation (2010-2015) in 2010. The four pillars of the program were
highly relevant at the time of appraisal and still relevant in the current context. This is reflected
by the CPS progress report (2011). The objective of the CPS (2006) was to help Government
deal with short-term trade shocks and the transition to a more competitive and sophisticated
economy and was centered on the four pillars of the Government‟s strategy. The CPS progress
report notes that “the objectives of the CPS remain relevant and aligned to the country’s
development agenda.? The two current DPO series that was approved by the Board in March
2012 recognize the importance of transitioning to knowledge and skill based services economy,
while consolidating the base. The emphasis on public sector efficiency, competitiveness, and
social safety nets is very strong. While business environment has substantially improved during
the program implementation, yet there are challenges ahead. There is a need for further
streamlining of regulations, remove unnecessary hurdles and improve institutions at the customs
for more transparency. Improving public sector efficiency continues to be of high relevance for
Mauritius in the current context, despite improvements have been achieved so far and as
reflected by two indicators in the World Governance Indicators 2011 – Government
effectiveness and regulatory quality. As highlighted in section 1, the ICT sector has gained
substantially more importance in terms of value added, exports and employment. Greater use of
IT system for transactions and modernizing the civil service are key areas.

40.     Design: The project design was consistent with the project objectives and such a design
remains relevant in the current context. The program, overall, included reforms that were
strongly owned by the authorities, underpinned by strong analytical foundation and
complemented by financial and technical assistance by the donor community. The program was
developed in close coordination with other development partners to ensure that it reflected the
expertise of the institutions engaged and build synergy for the benefit of the country.
Partnerships with donors and local stakeholders will remain crucial, going forward. Mauritius
wants to make a leap to become a developed economy in the next ten years or so. There is a
knowledge gap in terms of key policy changes that are required to make this leap, and robust
analytical work in required to lay out the foundations.

41. Implementation: Flexibility was instilled in the program and the program‟s focus was on the
development objectives. Whenever there were changes in indicative triggers to firm up prior
actions, it was ensured that these changes do not altered the thematic content of the DPL and
were fully consistent with its development objectives. The program was aligned to government
medium term priorities but supported the country to address short term challenges. For example,
such that during the time of the global crisis, the program was adjusted to respond to the
immediate needs of the client, by scaling up the amount of the operation and also adding the
DDO facility to it. On capacity, it should be noted that the authorities have upgraded their skills
to a large extent in some areas, for example on fiscal management. The same model of

                                                 27
engagement is relevant in the current context. The technical capacity for implementation of some
specialized reforms is still limited. Therefore the combination of knowledge, technical assistance
and financing will continue to be relevant.

3.2 Achievement of PDO:

42.    Achievement of the PDO is highly satisfactory. Momentum for reforms was high
throughout the program. Despite external shocks in 2008/09 and 2010 due to the financial and
Euro zone crisis, the Government maintained macroeconomic stability and stayed the course of
reforms. The economy defied the negative consequences and observed overall positive growth
throughout the crisis period, although lower than forecasted at the beginning of the DPO
program. Economic activity slowed down during the crisis period but Government was able to
weather the negative consequences thanks to the fiscal space created due to the reform program.
The policy actions supported by the program were critical in achieving the objective of the PDO.
As reflected in section 1 (using examples from the ICT sector), Mauritius indeed transitioned
from a low wage, low skill economy to an innovative and skill based economy.

Objective 1: Consolidating fiscal performance and improving public sector efficiency-
Consolidating fiscal performance rating: highly satisfactory
Improving public sector efficiency rating: satisfactory
Overall rating: satisfactory

43.     The program supported reforms to improve fiscal and debt conditions. Fiscal discipline
was therefore critical. The aim in this area was to undertake measures to stabilize fiscal
performance at a sustainable level. Measures implemented were twofold: (i) stabilizing revenue
and (ii) reducing expenditure. On the revenue side, a number of policy changes in the tax system
were introduced to stabilize revenue above 19% of GDP. Discretionary power to grant
preferential import duty rates at ministerial level were abolished, tax administration were
strengthened through the operationalization of the MRA and personal income tax was simplified
by consolidating allowances and exemptions on emoluments, retirement pensions, pension
contributions, secure loan interest and more into a single general exemption set according to
household income. Passing legislation to abolish ministerial discretion over tax and duty
exemptions, and operationalization of the MRA to strengthen tax administration were prior
actions supported by this program. Revenue as a percentage of GDP indeed stabilized above 19
percent during the course of the program, but also beyond. In 2011, this ratio was at 21.3
percent.

44.     On the expenditure side, the objective was to contain recurrent expenditure. This was
to be achieved by annual cuts in primary spending by an additional 0.5% each year. The aim
was to reduce debt to GDP ratio below the 68.8 percent (the 2005/06 level). In 2006/2007 the
Government took a decisive step to cut primary spending by 2 percent of GDP, far exceeding the
target of 0.5 percent envisaged. Primary spending as a percentage of GDP by end 2007 was 20
percent. Greater fiscal responsibility in the form of lower government spending along with strong
GDP performance led to a reduction of debt-to-GDP ratio from 69.2 percent of GDP in 2006 to
57.5 percent of GDP in 2011. The Government showed firm intentions to reduce the debt burden
in Mauritius, demonstrated by the establishment of a Debt Management Unit, preparation of a

                                               28
debt management strategy and enacting of the Debt Management Act 2008. The reforms
implemented helped the Government build resilience and weather the impact of the financial
crisis by creating fiscal space with permitted the authorities to unveil a stimulus package of Rs
10.4 billion. Reduction in primary spending and enactment and proclamation of the Public Debt
Management Act were prior actions supported by this program. Although primary spending did
not reach the targeted value by the end of the operation, there is a move in that direction. The
target was not met by December 2010 due to injection of public funds to stimulate the economy
during the crisis period.

45.     Progress on public sector efficiency has been satisfactory. To improve public sector
efficiency, this program supported the preparation of sector strategies, implementation (on a pilot
basis) of performance management system, and preparation and implementation of reform plan
for 5 parastatals. Progress in this area has not been very strong. When the program was initiated,
it was expected that by DPL3, all sector ministries would have produced sector strategies to feed
into the national budget of 2008/09. The logic of this choice is that effective budgeting demands
a clear vision of sector objectives and a menu of strategically relevant, costed programs from
which policymakers can choose as they make tradeoffs within and across sectors. However, the
authorities postponed the preparation of the strategies to DPL4, but at the same time reduced the
number of sector strategies to only four. The implementation of performance management
system was indeed piloted within the Ministry of civil service, and is expected to be extended to
all ministries and parastatals. Implementation of the action plans produced to address the
challenges that 5 parastatals face is slow. Reforms in this area are politically sensitive and
progress in this area might take quite long. The DPO series that went to Board in March 2012,
has one pillar on parastatals reforms.

Objective 2: Enhancing trade competitiveness – Highly satisfactory

46.    The Government’s objective is to transform Mauritius in an open, globally connected,
low tax, business friendly environment. Towards this end, the reform agenda aimed at
enhancing trade competitiveness by (i) reducing anti-export bias which impedes private
investment in internationally competitive activities; (ii) revitalizing existing sectors to raise
productivity and release resources for higher productivity sectors and (iii) facilitating
development of export sectors through reducing costs and making selected public investments.

47.    The authorities continue to work towards making of Mauritius a “duty free island?. In
this context, one prominent reform area was the substantial reduction of custom tariff. The

                                                   29
number of tariff lines with zero rated tariffs increased from 74 percent in 2005/06 to 87 percent
in 2010. The Government continues in this direction. In 2012 the Government abolished duties
on further 80 tariff lines (0.64% percent of total tariff lines). It should be noted that the target in
this area was too ambitious. The authorities planned to eliminate tariffs on 95 percent of tariff
lines. But, this was unrealistic to achieve. Analyses were not undertaken to assess the possible
negative consequences that accelerated tariff reductions may have on domestic producers. In
fact, substantial reduction in tariffs resulted in unanticipated effects on domestic producers.
There were no accompanying policies to mitigate this impact, nor was producers given enough
lead time to accommodate the policy changes. To counteract these effects, the Government
provided for funds in the budget of 2007/08 to support the local firms to strengthen their capacity
in product innovation, marketing and export promotion. Besides elimination of tariffs for 88
percent of tariff lines, the highest tariff band was also reduced from 60 percent to 30 percent. In
2005/06, 13 percent of tariff lines were subject to a tariff rate of 30 per cent or above and this
reduced to 1 percent in 2010. Phased tariff reduction by cutting top ad valorem rate from 65 to
30 percent, reducing number of top rated tariff lines and reducing average tariffs by 2 percent
was a prior action supported by this program

48.      With reduction in tariffs, inappropriate regulations hindering trade became more
evident. A number of inappropriate regulations and implementation bottlenecks which
compromise competitiveness in Mauritius. The program supported the setting-up of a permanent
regulatory review committee (the Non-Tariff Barriers (NTB) Review Committee) with
responsibility to: (i) define the general principles of regulatory reform based on international best
practice and to ensure that these are applied consistently across line ministries and departments;
(ii) review all new and important existing regulations; (iii) oversee the introduction of regulatory
impact analysis as a key tool across the government; (iv) facilitate the intra-ministry coordination
that is essential to address a wide range of the regulatory constraints, including duplication of
requirements and (v) encourage and assist the roll out of IT solutions for trade facilitation across
ministries and agencies. This Committee effectively served as a platform for private sector to
voice out their complaints. This is an area where the Bank is providing continued assistance as
part of the new DPL series. The reforms include revamping of business regulations, streamlining
of Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs), and promoting services trade. Government actions to reduce air
transport costs by liberalizing air access has partially contributed towards the increased in
number of tourist arrivals in the country from 0.78 million in 2005/06 to close to 1 million in
2011.

49.     To boost exports a common regulatory regime across all sectors of the economy were
introduced and measures to improve international connectivity were undertaken. The
distinction between EPZs and non-EPZ producers was eliminated and the incentive regimes for
EPZ and non-EPZ firms have been unified, for example by setting all corporate taxes at 15
percent. Anti-labor bias in the tax system was eliminated by removing a 25 percent investment
tax credit, and the application process for licenses and permits streamlined to emphasize more on
ex-ante approvals of business registration rather than ex-post verification of safety and health
standards. Unifying tax and regulatory regimes for EPZ and non-EPZ firms was a prior action
supported by the program. The Government implemented reduction in IPLC prices by 50 percent
between 2003 and 2008. Also, to be in line with international standards, amendments have been
made to the Information and Communication and Technologies Act. These changes, which were

                                                  30
prior actions of the program, led to substantial increase in ICT-enabled business. The share of the
ICT sector as a percentage of GDP has increased from 5.4 percent in 2007 to 6.4 percent in 2010
and met the set target. International internet bandwidth has increased from 123 Mbps in 2005/06
to 1864 Mbps in 2010. However, the target for the indicator „increase exports as a share of GDP‟
was not achieved as exports suffered considerably during the global crisis period. Exports/GDP
fell to 47 percent in 2009. However, sustained effort led to increase in export to GDP both in
2010 (50 percent) and 2011 (53.4 percent).

Objective 3: improving the investment climate – Highly Satisfactory

50.     The program supported the government to improve the investment environment by
revising the regulations and streamlining unnecessary processes that were unnecessarily
retarding investments. To achieve this objective, the Government initiated the following: (i)
investment facilitation, (ii) increasing labor market flexibility, and (iii) attracting skilled foreign
workers. With a rank of 20 in the Ease of Doing Business indicators, Mauritius is one of the best
ranked African countries. The Doing Business index takes into account several factors including
the following factors which were monitoring indicators in this operation: number of days to start
business, number of days it takes to enforce commercial contracts, public credit registry, and
number of days spent dealing with construction permits, and difficulty in firing index. All target
related to these indicators were achieved. Improved investment environment helped in raising
FDI from 2.8 billion rupees in 2005/06 to greater than 12 billion rupees in 2010.

51.      The program supported dismantling barriers that caused delays in registering
businesses. Prior to the policy changes that the program supported, unnecessarily complex
procedures created uncertainty and often required long waits for clearances and permits. One of
the key areas of policy change that this program supported through its prior action was to
facilitate doing business by streamlining registration practices. To this end, the Government
enacted the Business Facilitation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 which included a wide
range of measures to expedite business registration, amending and abrogating several laws. This
Act made the Registrar of Companies a one-stop shop for and changed the role of the BOI from
granting discretionary approvals for investment projects to facilitation. It also relaxed restrictions
on granting work and residency permits. The number of registered companies increased from
29,330 in 2007 to 33,002 in 2011, an increase of around 12 percent.

                                                        31
52.     To forge competition by domestic business, the creation of a Competition Commission
was supported by this operation. The setting up of this mechanism was crucial to prevent anti-
competitive behavior. If investigations show that firms are involved in anticompetitive
behaviors, the Commission has powers to intervene and correct the situation through fines and/or
other punitive measures. The commission has so far completed investigation on two cases and is
currently investigating on six additional cases.

53.     The program supported policy changes towards easing entry of foreign skilled workers
by facilitating permit issuance and towards improving labor market efficiency by introducing a
flexi-security scheme. The problem of shortage in skilled labor was partially resolved by easing
entry of foreign workers in the labour market by creating a single occupational permit by
combining residency and work permits, and legalizing conversion of tourist to business visas.
With the promulgation of the Employment Rights Act (2008), a “flexi-security? scheme was
introduced with the aim of increasing labour market efficiency by strengthening worker
protection rather than jobs. To reduce employee resistance to necessary structural changes in the
labour market, the scheme provides for a maximum of twelve months of transitional assistance to
employees who wish to take opportunity of the scheme to seek job replacements, undergo
training and reskilling or start a small business, and these employees benefited from financial
assistance. As of December 2010, around 3000 workers (52% female and 48% male) benefited
from this scheme, of which 80 percent sought job replacement.

54.      The program supported wage increase linked to productivity rather than wage being
consumer price index linked. To this end, the program used as prior action the establishment
and operationalization of a new NPC during the 2007 pay round which would replace the
tripartite wage bargaining mechanisms so as to tie wages closely to worker productivity. In 2010,
a new system for wage negotiation has been set up - the tripartite wage bargaining system. This
is a hybrid of the system supported by the program and the former system whereby wage was
negotiated based on index changes.

Objective 4: Democratizing the economy through participation, social inclusion and
sustainability – Satisfactory.

55.    The programme supported reforms to shield the vulnerable from negative impacts of
the transition towards higher value added services and to provide opportunities to improve
inclusion. In this context, the program aligned with Government‟s objectives to enhancing
opportunities for education and (re)training, protecting the vulnerable by channelling social
support to the truly needy, and implementing a comprehensive strategy for poverty alleviation.

56.     The programme supported strengthening the educational system. This is in line with
the Government objective to enable young Mauritians to be employable in the new sectors and
participate fully in a knowledge based economy. At the same time, education plays a key role in
increasing participation and social equity. The Government prepared an Education Strategy
Paper covering the period 2008 to 2020 with the support of the EU. This strategy covered five
main subsectors (pre-primary, primary, secondary, tertiary and TVET). The strategy also had a
costed implementation plans with specific objectives. The goal was to expand opportunities in
education, improve teacher training and supervision, modernize the curriculum to feature more
critical thinking and mathematics, science and language training, revitalize the Zones
d‟Education Prioritaires (ZEP) schools with provision of supportive services (food, health, and
remedial teachers), encourage community participation, and expand tertiary education. The plan
has been adopted by the Government and is currently being implemented. For example
curriculum has been modernized and science subjects have been introduced at primary school
level. The ZEP schools have also been provided with support services. DPL2 and DPL3 actions
have supported preparation of a national education strategy. Primary and secondary school
completion rate has increased from 64.9 and 78.4 percents in 2005/06 to 74.1 and 79.2 percent in
2011. The expected target for secondary completion rate has not yet been achieved, but the
country is moving in that direction.

57.      The social safety net has been strengthened. The authorities have pursued a number of
policy actions to assure that opportunities would reach as many Mauritians as possible while
fundamental economic changes would take place. A major initiative, the Empowerment
Program, with the objectives to: (i) providing placement, training and re-skilling for the
unemployed; (ii) supporting entrepreneurship and SME competitiveness through financial and
technical assistance; (iii) advancing social housing and development amongst poor families and
(iv) support older unemployed women was launched and the establishment of the Empowerment
Program was a DPL1 prior action. The Government has scaled up the operations of the
Empowerment Program which is now called the NEF. The NEF oversees a wide range of
initiatives, but the main one is the Placement Program. It also oversees placement and training
for women displaced from textile sector. The number of trained workers under the NEF has
increased from 821 in 2006/07 to over 12,000 by end 2011. The number of displaced women
placed in jobs increased from 45 in 2008/09 to over 200 by the end of 2011. In this case the
target was 600 and was not achieved. This is mainly because the majority of the displaced
women preferred to be re-trained to join other sectors rather than be re-employed in the textile
sector.




                                              33
 58.     Government has also set up an innovative scheme to promote growth of SMEs. With
 the support from the Bank, the Mauritius Business Growth Scheme (MBGS) was introduced.
 Under this scheme, eligible firms receive financing to support their business growth on a cost-
 sharing basis. 58 SMEs have benefited from this scheme by the end of 2011.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts:
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

60.     The DPL series supported the objective of transforming the Mauritius economy
towards a high value-added services economy. This was a process that the authorities already
started in the early 2000 to start preparing to adapt to a world without trade preferences. The
cumulative net job losses in apparel and sugar industry between 2001 and 2006 (sectors facing
the trade preference shocks) reached around 9 percent of total employment. The impact was
higher for women than men. Some measures in the reform program may have produced losers as
well as winners. For instance, tariff cuts while raise real incomes of some low income
households by reducing the cost of goods, they also contribute to job losses in vulnerable sectors.
The Government slowed the pace of tariff liberalization to minimize the negative impacts and
balancing these competing interests.

61.     Since the beginning of the program supported by the Bank in 2006, the authorities
have pursued a number of policy actions to assure that the most vulnerable are and the poor
catered for. The Government has also been careful to include in the program accompanying
measures to mitigate some of the social costs. One of the main pillars of the reform program has
been the democratization of the economy. This consisted of reforms to the national economic
structure that will open the doors of economic opportunities to the majority of the population.
The main vehicle has been active labor market programs through the NEF (formerly the
Empowerment Program) with training subsidies and support to the unemployed for starting
SMEs, including special programs for women entrepreneurs. The workfare program was
introduced to cushion worker reallocation pressure as labor regulatory framework was being
revised in 2008/09. The objective of this program is to support laid off workers to reintegrate the
labor market either as employee or as small entrepreneurs through training and placement
offered by the NEF or the Small Enterprise and Handicraft Development Authority (SEHDA). A
placement and training was introduced to unemployed person with an opportunity for job
placement jointly with work-related formal training. In an attempt to address the problem of
mismatch in the labour market, arising primarily because the structure of the economy is
changing towards higher value added production and services-based economy, such programmes
support in providing the rightly trained people to the industry.

62.     Preservation of jobs was at the centre of the policies. During the global crisis, in an
attempt to save jobs in the tourism and manufacturing Sectors, a mix of work and training
scheme was introduced to support enterprises facing financial difficulties of at least 15%
reduction in their turnover. Instead of firing workers, the firms were given incentives to keep
them employed but for a lesser number of days per week. On the other non-working days, the
employees followed trainings. The cost of the training and the daily salary of non-working days
are covered by the NEF. A Special Entrepreneurship Program (SEP) was also introduced with
the objective to promote entrepreneurship culture, more geared towards small and medium
enterprises. This program operates under three legs: financing support schemes, support sectors
in difficulty, and promote profession of art which are slowly disappearing. Accompanying
measures have mitigated some more egregious distributional impacts of the reforms. For
example in 2006, a means tested income support scheme was introduced to compensate for
eliminating consumer subsidies on rice and flour. The Government also remained committed to

                                                35
Eradicating Absolute Poverty (EAP). With the support of the development community the
authorities better measured the low-frequency event of absolute poverty, improved qualitative
poverty monitoring, developed poverty maps combining household surveys and census data, and
identified pockets of extreme poverty, all of which helped to improve targeting. All these
measure jointly helped the authorities to reverse unemployment rate and better cater for the poor
and vulnerable.

63.      The reversal of increasing unemployment provides evidence of a positive overall social
impact of the reform program. Most significant there has been the decline in female
unemployment rate explained by strong job creation in the services sector. Unemployment rate
among males has also been declining. The world economic crisis caused mild deterioration of
labor market outcomes. Unemployment rate is close to 8 percent, from close to 10 percent at the
start of the reform program.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-
term capacity and institutional development):

64.     Institution strengthening and capacity building were supported in this programmatic
series. There has been substantial institutional development and capacity building under this
program, especially in the areas of fiscal consolidation, enhancing competitiveness and statistics.
At the Ministry of Finance the capacity to prepare more comprehensive budget documents
including forecasting in the context of PBB and linking expenditure to macroeconomic
framework, has been built. The capacity at the Ministry of Finance in monitoring budget
execution has also been improved as the ministry is constantly monitoring deviations between
allocated funds and actual expenditure for each ministry, departments and agencies on a monthly
basis. The program supported the establishment of a Debt Management Unit. The Bank‟s
Treasury assisted the Government to develop plan for improving Public Debt Management and
also conducted workshops to strengthen the relationship with key counterparts within the
Government and advancing the policy dialogue. Trainings were also delivered to improve
capacity to for debt assessment and management. Other examples include the creation of a
Competition Commission and the setting-up of a permanent regulatory review committee. These
developments were important to enable the Government ensuring that policy decisions are

                                                        36
indeed institutionalized and implemented. Technical assistance has been provided to the
statistical office to improve the capacity of the staffs to undertake surveys and poverty related
analysis.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

65.     The implementation of the reform program has realized much more benefits than was
anticipated during the design of the program. For example, strengthening tax administration and
abolishing discretion over tax and duty exemptions improved the raking of Mauritius in the
global ranking of paying taxes to 9th position (2011). Service delivery to tax payers has
substantially improved. Taxes can be paid online as well as submission of relevant documents
can be filed online.

3.4 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops:

66.     There were no beneficiary survey and/or stakeholder workshops


4.    Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

67.     The risks that development outcomes or expected outcomes will not be maintained or
realized are moderate. This assessment takes into account both the probability and likely impact
of threats to outcomes. It considers how these have been mitigated in the operation‟s design or
by actions taken during its initial implementation. The following individual criteria of risk has
been considered as it may affect realized/planned outcomes:

a. Technical and financial risks are low. Interviews with industry associations‟ show that a large
   number of medium and big firms have moved to more capital intensive production. Changes
   in innovative technology and systems helped to improve profitability and development of the
   firms. At national level, the country is rated investment grade and has a sound financial
   system. Therefore, there exists minimal risk that technical changes and limited availability
   of finance and robustness of financial flows will affect the development outcomes.

b. Economic risk related to external shocks is moderate: The risk of external shocks associated
   with the uncertainties in the global economic environment is moderate as the economy
   remains vulnerable given its large dependence for its tourism industry on the European
   market. The external environment may also affect aid and foreign investments in the
   economy and thus impact on development outcome. The risk that changes at country and
   global level will affect the development outcomes is moderate. The country is dependent on
   exports of goods and services, especially to Europe (about 70 percent). Therefore the speed
   and timing of recovery of European countries will affect development outcomes. The slower
   than expected recovery is already affecting exports of commodities and prolonged slow
   recovery may deteriorate external accounts and growth. The country is conscious of the
   situation and measures have been announced to diversify products and markets towards
   emerging economies like India and China. Another source of concern at macroeconomic
   level is debt sustainability. The ambitious public investment program could increase public

                                               37
       debt above the legally defined threshold. An external shock and/or an increase in the fiscal
       deficit would raise this ratio to levels that might lead to the downgrading of Mauritius by
       international rating agencies, raising the cost of financing.

c. The risk that momentum of reform will be lost is moderate: Mauritius has a well established
   tradition of political stability5, dialogue and social harmony. The political situation is stable
   and the country has no history of major political instability which led to any sort of economic
   or social instability in the country. Therefore political risk affecting development outcomes
   is low. The Government‟s ownership and commitment to reforms continues to be high.
   However, since the second generation of reforms would deal with politically risky areas, for
   example improving efficiency in public enterprise reforms and civil service reforms, the
   probability that these reforms will be slower than economically justified is high. Also, while
   Mauritius has proved its capacity and ability to re-engineer itself and adjust to changing
   conditions, second generation reforms to improve the regulatory environment will require
   close cooperation with the private sector and public enterprises. There might be some
   reluctance to move quickly. On macroeconomic management, the Government has shown
   strong commitment to maintain economic stability and has been successful in dealing with
   the global crisis in terms of absorbing the shocks as well as providing necessary cushion to
   employees who lost jobs. While there is no reason to assume that the commitment and
   ability of Government to maintain macroeconomic stability, the risk of delayed reforms in
   key area may moderately affect development outcomes.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(Relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)




5.1 Bank Performance

       Rating: Highly Satisfactory

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

       Rating: Highly Satisfactory

68.    Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is highly satisfactory. The program
supported a comprehensive structural reform program. The policy changes in the reform program
responded to the medium term challenges that the country faced at the time of the start of the
program, as well as short term challenges at the beginning of each operation.

5
    Although coalitions between political parties are made and broken quite frequently, there has never been a coup.

                                                           38
69.     The Government’s bold and ambitious reform program reform program which the
DPL series supported was underpinned by strong analytical foundations. Prior to and during
the start of the preparation of this programmatic series, the Bank and other donors carried out
extensive AAA work. The two AAAs (both by the Bank) that guided the design of the
Government‟s reform agenda were the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) and an Aid for
Trade mission (AFT) report. The CEM focused on the structural transition to a higher value
added, knowledge based economy and recommended policy reforms in three key areas: (i) role
and performance of the public sector; (ii) the labor market and human capital formation; and (iii)
science and technology in a knowledge based economy. The recommendations of this mission
quickly built up an excellent and highly influential dialog at both the technical and political
levels. It proposed measures to strengthen competitiveness, move resources out of declining and
into dynamically growing sectors, improve the quality and cost of input services such as
telecommunications, air transport and cargo handling, and strengthen transitional support for
displaced workers. The four pillars, on which the reform program was anchored (see section 1.2),
were guided mainly by these two AAAs. The Investment Climate Assessment (2005), and the
Unemployment Study (2005) have also contributed to identify crucial constraints to growth and
propose policy actions. Technical assistance in the areas of MTEF and Performance
Management dating back to 2002 have also generated important insights regarding
modernization of Public Sector. Continuous production of analytical work guided specific
reforms in the subsequent operations.

70.      The DPL and the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)6 are closely linked. The two
were prepared concurrently and jointly cross referenced to the Government‟s program which was
itself coming into focus at the same time. Both are intended to support the adjustment to the
triple trade shock and structural transition to a more competitive and higher value added
economy. They share the same overarching strategic objectives of increasing competitiveness
while protecting the vulnerable, and their matrices are built around the same four pillars of the
Government‟s reform program. The great majority of the DPL‟s actions and triggers are drawn
from the CPS. The pillars of the reform program continued to remain the priority of the
Government throughout the four operations, and beyond, as evidenced by maintaining these
pillars in the CPS progress review in 2011.

71.     The design of this operation applied lessons learned from Bank’s previous Bank’s
(meager) engagement. In FY02, the Bank approved a programmatic series of Public Expenditure
Reform Loan (PERL) and this program provided two important lessons which have greatly
influenced the preparation of this series. The first lesson concerns ownership. Like the PERL,
this series supported the Government‟s own reform program to ensure commitment for reforms.
It recognizes the importance of supporting an agenda which is Government owned at the highest
level and better yet, which enjoys broad popular support. Second, the design of the operation was
mindful of the risk that the operation may not continue beyond the first year (as was the case in
PERL). In light of that, care has been taken to ensure that DPL-1 actions were in themselves of
standalone strategic importance, but at the same time actions that fitted well with the remaining
operations in this series to ensure integration within the overall framework of the program. This
was to ensure some level of developmental impact even if there were no follow on.

    Presented to the Board in November 2006.

                                               39
72.      Assessments of relevant aspects were correct. The program correctly evaluated
institutional, fiduciary and environmental aspects. None of these evaluations was proven wrong
during the subsequent operations. In each of the operation of the program, risk assessments were
relevant and mitigating factors were envisaged. Poverty and social development aspects were
considered fully as one of the main components of the program was related to inclusion and
increased opportunities to empower the vulnerable to participate in economic activities. The
M&E framework was sound and assessment of the political economy was correct.

73.     During preparation of the subsequent operations, the Bank identified actions such that
it was most likely for the country to achieve planned development outcomes. This was
important in areas where the triggers that were identified for operation „n+1‟ during preparation
of operation „n‟. In some cases, the country progresses more rapidly than anticipated where as in
some cases, progress were slower and therefore the prior actions may have had to deviate from
the identified trigger. In those cases, the actions were carefully crafted to ensure that the planned
development objectives were achievable. For example, in DPL2, one of the indicative trigger for
DPL 3 was to prepare sector strategies for budgetary purposes. However, the authorities needed
more time to prepare good strategies, and also not all ministries had the capacity to prepare a
sector strategy. To be more realistic, in the preparation of DPL3, this trigger did not

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements):

       Rating: Highly Satisfactory

74.     Quality of supervision is highly satisfactory. The focus of supervisions was on the
development objectives and outcomes indicators. Since this program was a programmatic series
with subsequent operations in each consecutive fiscal year, the program benefited from the
supervision of operation „n‟ being conducted side by side with preparation of operation „n+1‟.
This has permitted documenting the progress of the reform program on a yearly basis, and to
better determine the needs for technical assistance to advance the reform program. This also
allowed the Bank to understand the political economy and capacity at different ministries/
agencies and the reasons why reforms advance faster in some areas. Progress on the program was
also being tracked during the annual business planning meetings between the Government and its
development partners. Also, given the high capacity of the statistical office and the
macroeconomic unit at the Ministry of Finance to produce and disseminate online frequent and
reliable data, monitoring of outcome indicators was made easier. Cooperation between the Bank
and other DPs and the IMF was excellent. The Bank also participated in the IMF Article IV
missions which helped better understanding the debt sustainability situation and macroeconomic
conditions.

75.     Continuous supervision resulted in proactive actions. The constant monitoring of the
Mauritius economy in the context of the changes in the global environment drew the attention of
the authorities of the potential impact the financial crisis of 2008 on the island‟s economy. On
the request of the authorities, the Bank jointly with the fund produced likely macroeconomic
scenarios depending on the severity of the crisis and shared with the authorities to be used for
internal discussions on the impact and policy choices for mitigating the effects of the crisis.

                                                 40
Through continuous dialogue the Bank proactively help the government to mitigate the negative
effects of the global crisis while maintaining the momentum for reforms. The Bank scaled up the
amount of the financing in DPL3 and also designed the operation into a DDO. This flexibility in
meeting the needs of the authorities just in time was important to ensure that the reform program
is not jeopardized.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

76.     Overall Bank performance was highly satisfactory. According to ICR Guidelines, the
overall ratings are dictated by the combination of ratings for Quality at Entry and Quality of
Supervision. A combination of highly satisfactory rating at quality at entry and highly
satisfactory rating for supervision implies a combined rating of highly satisfactory.


5.2 Borrower Performance

Government Performance/ Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance/ Overall
Borrower Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

77.     The Borrower’s performance is highly satisfactory. In this operation, the Government
and implementing agency cannot be distinguished separately. Therefore the rating in this section
should be considered as overall rating for the borrower. The Ministry of Finance was the driver
and coordinating body for the reform program. It was responsible for the overall management of
the reforms. The overall amount of progress made in all the pillars of the reform program is
impressive, and underscores a significant commitment to advance the reforms at the highest
level.

78.    The authorities had a strong ownership of the reform program and were committed to
implement the program in a realistic timeframe. The program was very ambitious and bold.
Strong ownership, leadership, and commitment of the Government to the reform agenda were
key factors to attaining the development objectives. The authorities, given their weak capacity
for implementation of the reform program knowledge gap in some areas, partnered with several
development partners to secure technical assistance and analytical work to help in the
implementation of the program. Relationship and coordination between Government and other
partners is effective. The Government played a critical role in ensuring that the development
partners collaborate in their engagement with the Government and complement each other‟s
work for the benefit of the country. The Ministry of Finance quite often organized meetings with
development partners to take stock of on-going engagement and ensuring that there were no
duplications. The DPL missions usually worked as the platform for these meetings. Continuous
dialogue prepared the ground for bolder reforms in the current programmatic series.

79.   The authorities created an institutional set up to consistently monitor progress.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements by the Government improved and the environment

                                               41
enabling reforms were sound. Several units under the Ministry of Finance were involved in the
reform process. The ministry set up a team of Ministry of Finance staffs, called SMSTs, to
coordinate budget preparation and progress in the reform program with sector ministries. One
SMST was responsible for one sector ministry and the SMSTs were participating in the mission
of the Bank. Their main objectives were to ensure that the reform program was on track and to
identify funding requirements for the implementation of the reforms so that these requirements
can be included in the budget. The Ministry of Finance and the statistical office put lots of
emphasis on producing reliable data and make these data publicly available on their websites,
and this allowed easy monitoring of the program‟s progress and performance. Fiduciary
arrangements in the country were already reliable when the first operation was designed.

80.     Partnership between the authorities and the private sector played a critical role in the
implementation of the program. To ensure effective implementation, a few committees are co-
chaired between the public and private sectors. For example, the non-tariff barriers committee
and the committee set up during the crisis in 2008 to put together the policy measures to mitigate
the impact. The public and private sectors have a culture of working together during the budget
preparation time. This culture was intensified during the DPL series and the dialogue between
these two sectors became more often. As the implementation of the program was progressing, the
private sector was invited to more and more meetings with the authorities to contribute to the
discussions. This was mainly during discussions on the pillars of investment climate and
competitiveness.


5.   Lessons Learned

81.      The key lessons learned from this program pertain to: (i) Strong Government ownership
and leadership, (ii) alignment with Government priorities and incremental approach in dialogue,
(iii) strong coordination with DPs, and (iv) flexibility.

82.     Strong Government ownership and capacity drives reforms. Ownership, leadership,
commitment and capacity of the authorities, at the highest level, in design and implementation of
the policy reform agenda have been the most important factor in the success of an operation.
Technical assistance in parallel to the operations which builds capacity as well as nurture
collaboration and joint work improves performance. For example, to improve competitiveness
of the country, passing of the Business Facilitation Act 2006 was instrumental in improving the
regulatory framework and making it more business friendly and implementation of new
measures did not take long to happen as the first tier cadres have a high implementation capacity.
Another example is the commitment to improve macroeconomic stability which led to the self-
imposition of a debt law with a ceiling on the debt to GDP ratio. In areas where ownership by
sector ministries was weak, especially the less consensual reforms which have political
implications, for instance in the areas of civil service and public enterprises, reforms were
implemented at a slower pace. The driving force for reforms and coordinating mechanism came
from the Ministry of Finance, and thus reforms which were to be implemented by the Ministry of
Finance were successfully implemented. However, a better understanding of the political
economy would have improved the engagement with sector ministries and possibly the
implementation of the reform agenda. Since the country now moved to second generation

                                               42
reforms, engagement with sector ministries should be deepened to ensure ownership of the
reform plan at the ministries‟ level. The coordinating role should continue to remain with the
Ministry of Finance as this ministry has the capacity of looking at the macro perspective and
effectively plays the role of policy coordination within the Government. A key lesson for
Mauritius is that reforms are better implemented where the reform champion is strong both at
policy and technical levels.

83.     Alignment with Government priorities is a necessary ingredient for rapid policy
changes. Alignment with Government priorities and incremental dialogue provides valuable
weight to immediate and short term policy exigencies while building consensus for broader and
bolder reforms. The incremental dialogue approach essentially helps the Government to identify
and articulate country priorities and as such build the ground in terms of substance and
sequencing for subsequent operations. Strong knowledge base helps to identify priority areas of
reforms as well as specific measures to be implemented. Alignment and incremental dialogue
also helps in designing pragmatic time bound prior actions and the setting realistic targets.
Agreement on the set of results and continued dialogue motivate agencies, but more importantly,
the champions to remain focus on the reform agenda. Going forward, the combination of
developing strong knowledge base to prioritise the areas of reforms and incremental dialogue in
politically-sensitive areas should be maintained. This combination ensures ownership of reforms,
especially at sector level.

84.      Strong coordination with DPs avoids duplication and harmonize results framework.
There has been a positive impact from the highly harmonized policy dialogue across donors
providing budget support. Government‟s capability to take leadership in coordinating
development assistance from the donor community has been instrumental. The ability of the
team to work in close collaboration with DPs resulted in harmonizing results framework through
common policy dialogue with the Government. Close coordination has proven to be an effective
way to support budget planning and execution. Building on technical support across sectors for
capacity building and analytical work by DPs contributed to achievement of the objectives of the
program. Dissemination of ESWs helped to strengthen momentum for reforms and build allies.
For example the dissemination of the ICA 2009 and the Trade and Labor ESW in 2010 brought
together public sector, private sector and the Bank together to reinforce synergy. Going forward,
strong coordination with partners should continue. This will help to avoid duplication and build
allies to accelerate the reform agenda. The M&E framework has to be more realistically designed
and outcomes indicators should be clearly linked to the areas of support in the operation, and
should be re-adjusted in case of major changes.

85.     Flexibility to adjust and respond to Government emerging needs is fundamental.
Government immediate priorities change due to several factors like (i) external shocks, (ii)
justified resistance from affected sectors (possibly due to miscalculation of potential impacts of
reforms undertaken) and (iii) as a way to mitigate political risks. The ability to adapt to such
immediate changes in circumstances and priorities is essential for achievement of the objectives
in the medium term. For instance, the rapid response of the Bank through a DDO in the third
operation, as well as an increase in the value of the loan, helped keep on track the reforms. Also,
one additional operation was added to this series to align to the electoral cycle. Correct timing of
the individual operations helped sustained reform momentum. Each operation in the

                                                43
          programmatic series was aligned to the Government‟s budget cycle and this helped in
          maintaining the reform process on-going as most of the policy changes were announced in the
          budget whereby adoption by cabinet was easier. The timing of one of the operations also
          changed to match the change in budget timeframe which moved the financial year from July-
          June to align with the calendar year. This meant that there was a six month bridging gaps (i.e. a
          financial year of six months) and to sustain the reform momentum, an operation was prepared
          within this time frame.
