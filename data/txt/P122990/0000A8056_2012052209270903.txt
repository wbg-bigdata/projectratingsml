                              PDO Level Results Indicators

                              Progress towards the achievement of the Project development objectives will be measured by the following indicators:

                              1.           Deviation between actual and budgeted expenditure by targeted ministries;
                              2.           Ghost workers (as determined by payroll audits) removed from payroll;
                              3.           Public contracts > FCAF 250 million awarded on competitive basis;
                              4.           Yearly publish reports for Supreme Audit Authority and the State General Inspectorate.

                              The project has three components that are equally funded by IDA and the Republic of Congo:

                              •        Component 1. Increased Capacity of Targeted Ministries to Manage Financial and Human Resources (US$ 19, 8 million, of which IDA:
                              US$ 3.76 million, Gov: US$ 16.04 million): The objective of this component is to provide support to further increase transparency and
                              accountability in financial operations through technical assistance, provision of equipment and training in budget and human resources
                              management, and procurement. It also includes technical support to extend the Rapid Results approach in selected ministries.

                              •          Component 2. Strengthened Capacity to Ensure Public Sector Accountability and Transparency (US$ 3.5 million of which IDA: US$ 0.67
                              million, Gov: US$ 2.83 million): The objective of this component is to support the Independent Governance Observatory, the Governmental Anti-
                              Corruption Commission, the Economic and Financial Commission of Parliament, the Supreme Audit Institution, the State General Inspectorate,
                              Media and selected NGOs by providing technical assistance and training to enhance their capacity to monitor governance and anti-corruption
                              measures.

                              •          Component 3. Monitoring and Evaluation system (US$ 3.0 million of which IDA: US$ 0.57 million, Gov: US$ 2.43 million): The objective
                              of this component is to ensure the effective management and coordination of project implementation.

                              3. Project Description

                                                                                                                                                                     Page 1 of 5
                         The proposed project will finance both the continued implementation of reforms to the PFM system, in particular full implementation of the
                         computerized budget management system, as well as serve as a platform for debate on those reforms highlighted above.

                         Based on close consultations with the Government, the project will have three components: (i) Increased Capacity of Targeted Ministries
                         toManage Public Finance and Human Resources (US$ 19.8 million); (ii) Strengthened Capacity of Accountability Structures (US$ 3.5 million); and
                         (iii) Enhanced Monitoring and Evaluation system (US$ 3.0 million).

                         Component 1: Increased Capacity of Targeted Ministries to Manage Public Finances and Human Resources (US$ 19.8 million)

                         Discussions held in the context of the preparation of the project highlighted three main issues:
                         •           The HRM system currently in place does not provide government a good overview of skills and capacity available to it, which prevents
                         effective deployment of staff. The ‘fichier unique function publique-solde’, which was planned to be completed under the previous Governance
                         project, is not yet fully operational, and the elements that remain to install include the career management system. Completing this work is
                         therefore urgent.
                         •           Management systems and practices in line ministries do not allow for the implementation of results based management approaches,
                         which in turn are critical to ensuring effective planning and management and investment projects
                         •           The effective implementation of the reform programs initiated by Government require a rapid increase in skills in critical professions, in
                         particular in budget management, IT systems, procurement and project management. However, the public service legal and management
                         framework in its current form does not provide the mechanisms permitting government to recruit and develop capacity in a focused and effective
                         manner.
                         The project will provide support to continue PFM reforms, to implement the new Procurement Code, to improve HR management, and to introduce
                         Results Based Management approaches.

                         (a)       Sub Component 1: Continuing PFM reforms (US$ 16.525 million)

                         Activities to be financed under this sub-component are:
                         •           Completing implementation of the computerized budget management system (US$ 14.2 million)?. The new Project will support the
                         operationalization of the Recipient’s computerized budget management system through the: (i) acquisition and installation of required software; (ii)
                         connection of its customs and tax authorities and department-level finance units of its ministries to said system; and (iii) provision of training to the
                         personnel responsible for utilizing said system.

                         •          Supporting critical elements of the implementation of the revised Public Investment Action Plan (US$ 1.5 Million) and MTEF (US$ 1.0
                         Million). The Project will continue strengthening of the Recipient’s public investment management through the: (i) design within the key planning
                         and finance directorates of the Recipient’s ministries responsible, respectively, for finance, planning, transport, trade, agriculture and energy, of
                         information systems and databases and manuals needed for the effective identification and selection, monitoring and evaluation of their
                         investment projects and planning of the recurrent costs thereof; (ii) provision of training in budget planning for relevant personnel of the Recipient
                         in order to facilitate progressive decentralization of public expenditure management; (iii) updating of strategies for the education, health, agriculture
                         and energy sectors; and (iv) updating of macro-economic data for all sectors in order to prepare a suitable medium term expenditure framework.

                         The planned work under this component has benefited from the 2010 IMF AFRITAC study on the public expenditure management system, and will
                         help address key recommendations contained in this study.

                         (b)       Sub-component 2: Support of the implementation of the new procurement law (US$1.3 million)

                         The new Procurement code was adopted in 2009 and the TGCB Project supported its design and the establishment of the institutions charged with
                         the implementation of the Code. While the new code is being implemented, capacity constraints related to its application remain and need to be
                         addressed.

                         This sub-component will finance the following activities:
                         •         Provision of procurement training and technical assistance to relevant personnel of the Recipient (US$ 1 million): This activity is critical
                         to improve the ownership and implementation of the new procurement system. Training will be supported by the Project to familiarize stakeholders
                         with the new procurement system.
                         •         Support the development and the operationalization of a ‘Hotline’ to handle procurement complaints (US$ 0.3 million).

                         (c)        Sub-component 3: Enhanced payroll and personnel management capacity (US$ 1.0 Million)
                         This activity aims to address identified deficiencies in the public service management system, including the existence of ahigh numbers of ghost
                         workers and thus the ineffective use of wage bill resources. It responds to the identified need to strengthenHRM and payroll management
                         processes as noted in the AFRITAC report. Assistance provided will build on the ‘automated payroll system’ which was established under the
                         previous TGCB project.
                         While installation of an integrated payroll and HRM system was largely completed under the previous project, some of the accompanying activities,
                         in particular installation of installed software to permit effective career management and HR records keeping and the training of staff at the Ministry
                         of Public Service, remain to be completed. Work will focus on:
                         •          Completing the civil service master file system and related training (US$ 500,000);
                         •          Training of staff on using new instruments (US$ 500,000).

                         (d)      Sub-component 4: Extending results based management (RBM) approach and practises to additional ministries in order to address
                         budget and program implementation problems (USD 0.8 million)

                         A pilot approach to building Results Based Management practices in the Congolese administration was conducted under the previous Governance
                         project, focusing on the Ministry of Civil Service. The pilot approach was based on the Rapid Results methodology. The initial evaluation of results
                         conducted in June 2011 showed the strong potential of this approach as teams were able to address the concrete issues identified within set
                         timeframes. Considering the political commitment at the highest level to introducing results based management practices in the Republic of Congo,
                         and the experience gained through the pilot, it was decided to scale up this work in the next phase of implementing governance reforms and to
                         extend it to a further six ministries (Planning, Finance, Health, Transport, Energy, Trade, Civil Service, and SME). It was also decided that the

                                                                                                                                                                      Page 2 of 5
                         issues to be addressed using RRA, would be those that critically affect their ability to execute their budgets and investment projects under their
                         responsibility (Activity 1).

                          In a second phase, the experience gained during the Rapid Results Initiative pilots would be used to define and roll out a performance
                         management framework, including the development of an M&E framework linking at all levels within the ministry concerned, performance targets
                         to outputs to be delivered under the ministry’s budget, and linking them to performance targets for units and the design of a capacity building
                         program, and provision of related training.

                         Component 2: Strengthened Capacity of Accountability Structures ($3.5 million)

                         This component has two sub-components:

                         Sub-component 2.1: Supporting the Independent Observatory on Governance and the Anti-Corruption Commission US$ 1.5 million)
                         The project will provide technical assistance and training to enhance the capacity of the Independent Observatory on Governance and the
                         Government Anti-Corruption Commission to monitor governance and anti-corruption measures. Technical assistance will be focused on the two
                         following areas: Budget and Procurement. A training program will be prepared. Further investment in capacity development is required to ensure
                         both institutions fully play their role in the accountability system. The Independent Observatory on Governance is an independent structure created
                         in 2007 to monitor and evaluate progress made by the Government in the implementation of anti-corruption measures. The Anti-Corruption
                         Commission, created in 2004 and restructured in 2007, is responsible for implementation of the Government Anti-corruption policy. Both these
                         structures are funded by the government. The previous Project p rovided capacity building support to both structures, and continued support is
                         required to enhance their internal governance, transparency and effectiveness.

                         Sub-component 2.2: Demand for Good Governance (US$ 2, 0 million)

                         The Project will also provide technical assistance and training to reinforce the capacity of selected national NGOs and media to monitor and
                         evaluate implementation of key public reforms. The capacity building activities to be financed under this sub-component will allow the NGOs to:

                         -            Monitor the governance reforms underway and inform the population of the issues regarding public finance, procurement and other
                         reforms;
                         -           Gather feedback from the population concerning their experience and level of satisfaction regarding the quality of public services, how to
                         implement the reforms and how to improve national development strategies.
                         -           Monitor and analyze implementation of the national budget and how to advocate with the Parliament to ensure the budget reflects local
                         needs and priorities.
                         -           Collaborate with the existing anti-corruption structures to establish an effective coalition to pursue transparency, accountability and
                         integrity in public administration.

                         The national NGOs and the media will be selected based on objective criteria and will prepare action plans. In addition to technical assistance and
                         training, the Project will support them in disseminating the results of their analysis and monitoring of their activities. As the Bank has much less
                         leverage to pressure the Government to continue implementing reforms, such support will be extended to public accountability structures, such as
                         Economic and Finance Committee in Parliament, the Supreme Audit Authority, and the State Inspector General. Selected NGOs and media will,
                         as a condition of receiving the TA and training, be required to (a) prepare proposals for the TA they wish to receive and an action plan for applying

                         the TA they receive to specific activities designed to enhance the monitoring and evaluation of public finances and services and dissemination of
                         the results of the monitoring and evaluation; and (b) enter into agreements with the Recipient undertaking to carry out their action plans.

                         Component 3: Monitoring and Evaluation system (US$ 3.0 million)

                         This component will support the government of Congo in the development and institutionalization of monitoring and evaluation functions and
                         systems at national level and targeted sectors. Congo has no results-based M&E functions built-in as part of the duties and responsibilities of the
                         public administration. Production, management and user of performance information in government decision-making and accountability processes
                         are very week and there is a lack of sufficient, timely and reliable information to monitor budget planning implementation of programs and
                         accountability processes. More specially, the project will support the following activities:

                         •            Design and implementation of a national monitoring and evaluation system: The project will finance (i) the development of a Government
                         evaluation strategy with the necessary policy guidelines for implementation; (ii) preparation of arrays of indicators for economic and finance
                         programs; (iii) design and implementation of an evaluation agenda with the Government ministries. The Ministry of Planning will play a key role as
                         it will also coordinate the development of a M&E system for the PRSP second generation.

                         •           Implementation support to the Project Coordination Unit including the Project Coordinator, a Finance Manager, an accountant, a finance
                         officer, a procurement specialist, internal auditor, and a monitoring & evaluation (M&E) specialist. The project will also provide resources for
                         training in relevant areas for staff of relevant Ministries, as well as resources to recruit consultants with specific expertise as needed.


                         D.        Implementation cost
                         The World Bank’s contribution to the proposed operation will be a small IDA amount
                          (US$ 5 million) with US$ 21,3 million from the Government to move the agenda
                         reform in PFM, Public Procurement and Accountability.

                            E. Institutional arrangements

                         The project will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance as the lead ministry on PFM and procurement reforms. The inter-ministerial steering
                         committee, which will include representatives of both cross-cutting and key spending ministries, will oversee implementation and will be presided
                         by the Head of Cabinet of the Ministry of Finance.

                         The existing FM and Procurement capacity under the Governance Project coordinating unit will be used to handle the fiduciary functions.
                                                                                                                                                               Page 3 of 5
                               Procurement and Financial Management performance of the unit has been either satisfactory or moderately satisfactory for the last two years.
                               However, it is intended to gradually move implementation responsibility to the procurement units in the line ministries involved in the project, in
                               particular the ministries of Finance, Planning and Public Service, as well as the Observatoire and the Governmental Anti-Corruption Commission.
                               This transfer will take place once ceilings decentralizing procurement are increased from their current level. However, major procurement for the IT
                               systems will continue to be handled by the PIU for the duration of the project.
