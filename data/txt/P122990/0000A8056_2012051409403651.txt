                         I.   Project Context
                              Country Context
                              The Republic of Congo remains at the crossroads between what prevailed prior to the HIPC related reforms in the form of a largely
                              unaccountable state where private interest outweighed public interest, to becoming a more accountable and transparent state where decisions
                              are taken to meet shared development goals.

                              Many of the reforms initiated over the last 3 years are becoming irreversible in the sense that their positive impact has been demonstrated
                              (lower cost of investment projects, higher relevance of public investments and the positive impact of oversight and accountability institutions).

                              However, in order to retain this positive trajectory, significant further steps still need to be taken, in particular in reforming the PFM and PIM
                              systems. Providing technical advice on these reforms, as well as leveraging the domestic resources required to finance their implementation are
                              critical contributions at this point in time.

                              The TGCBP project has shown its value as a vehicle for providing such support, but the project ended in June 2011 and cannot be further

                              extended. The design of a follow up or ‘repeater’ project is therefore a critical contribution to the reform process. The new project will finance
                              continued implementation of reforms to the PFM system, in particular the full implementation of the Schema Directeur, as well as serving as a
                              platform for debate on those reform areas highlighted above where a consensus on the way forward has not yet been achieved


                         II. Sectoral and Institutional Context
                              The objective to which the Transparency and Governance Capacity Building Project will contribute is to strengthen the capacity of targeted public
                              sector ministries, agencies and accountability structures for improved management of human and financial resources. The proposed KPIs for the
                              PDO are the following:

                              1.        Deviation between actual and budgeted expenditure by targeted ministries;
                              2.        Ghost workers (as determined by payroll audits) removed from payroll;
                              3.        Public contracts > FCAF 250 million awarded on competitive basis;
                              4.        Yearly publish reports for Supreme Audit Authority and the State General Inspectorate.

                         III. Project Development Objectives
                              To strengthen the capacity of targeted public sector ministries, agencies and accountability structures for improved management of human and
                              financial resources.

                              Project Beneficiaries

                              Direct Project Beneficiaries will include the Ministries of Finance, Planning, Public Service, Health, PME (Small and Medium Scale Enterprises),
                              Trade, Agriculture Transport, Education, and Energy, as well as the General Directorate for Public Works, (DGGT), the Regulatory Authority for
                              Public Tenders (ARMP), General Directorate for Public Contracts (GGCMP), Parliament, Supreme Audit Authority, the State Inspector General,
                              Independent Governance Observatory, Anti-Corruption Commission, Media and selected NGOs. Indirect Project beneficiaries will include the
                              population who can expect to see improved performance in public service delivery.

                              PDO Level Results Indicators

                              Progress towards the achievement of the Project development objectives will be measured by the following indicators:
                             1.        Deviation between actual and budgeted expenditure by targeted ministries;
                             2.        Ghost workers (as determined by payroll audits) removed from payroll;
                             3.        Public contracts > FCAF 250 million awarded on competitive basis;
                             4.        Yearly publish reports for Supreme Audit Authority and the State General Inspectorate.

                             The project has three components that are equally funded by IDA and the Republic of Congo:

                             Based on close consultations with the Government, the project will have three components: (i) Increased Capacity of Targeted Ministries
                             toManage Public Finance and Human Resources (US$ 19.8 million); (ii) Strengthened Capacity of Accountability Structures (US$ 3.5 million);
                             and (iii) Enhanced Monitoring and Evaluation system (US$ 3.0 million).

                             Component 1: Increased Capacity of Targeted Ministries to Manage Public Finances and Human Resources (US$ 19.8 million)
                             Discussions held in the context of the preparation of the project highlighted three main issues:
                             •           The HRM system currently in place does not provide government a good overview of skills and capacity available to it, which prevents
                             effective deployment of staff. The ‘fichier unique function publique-solde’, which was planned to be completed under the previous Governance
                             project, is not yet fully operational, and the elements that remain to install include the career management system. Completing this work is
                             therefore urgent.
                             •           Management systems and practices in line ministries do not allow for the implementation of results based management approaches,
                             which in turn are critical to ensuring effective planning and management and investment projects
                             •           The effective implementation of the reform programs initiated by Government require a rapid increase in skills in critical professions, in
                             particular in budget management, IT systems, procurement and project management. However, the public service legal and management
                             framework in its current form does not provide the mechanisms permitting government to recruit and develop capacity in a focused and effective
                             manner.
                             The project will provide support to continue PFM reforms, to implement the new Procurement Code, to improve HR management, and to
                             introduce Results Based Management approaches.

                             (a)       Sub Component 1: Continuing PFM reforms (US$ 16.7 million)

                             Activities to be financed under this sub-component are:
                             •           Completing implementation of the computerized budget management system (US$ 14.2 million)?. The new Project will support the
                             operationalization of the Recipient’s computerized budget management system through the: (i) acquisition and installation of required software;
                             (ii) connection of its customs and tax authorities and department-level finance units of its ministries to said system; and (iii) provision of training to
                             the personnel responsible for utilizing said system.
                             •           Supporting critical elements of the implementation of the revised Public Investment Action Plan (US$ 1.5 Million) and MTEF (US$ 1.0
                             Million). The Project will continue strengthening of the Recipient’s public investment management through the: (i) design within the key planning
                             and finance directorates of the Recipient’s ministries responsible, respectively, for finance, planning, transport, trade, agriculture and energy, of
                             information systems and databases and manuals needed for the effective identification and selection, monitoring and evaluation of their
                             investment projects and planning of the recurrent costs thereof; (ii) provision of training in budget planning for relevant personnel of the Recipient
                         in order to facilitate progressive decentralization of public expenditure management; (iii) updating of strategies for the education, health,
                         agriculture and energy sectors; and (iv) updating of macro-economic data for all sectors in order to prepare a suitable medium term expenditure
                         framework.

                         The planned work under this component has benefited from the 2010 IMF AFRITAC study on the public expenditure management system, and
                         will help address key recommendations contained in this study.

                         Sub-component 2: Support of the implementation of the new procurement law (US$ 1.3 million)

                         The new Procurement code was adopted in 2009 and the TGCB Project supported its design and the establishment of the institutions charged
                         with the implementation of the Code. While the new code is being implemented, capacity constraints related to its application remain and need to
                         be addressed.

                         This sub-component will finance the following activities:
                         •         Provision of procurement training and technical assistance to relevant personnel of the Recipient (US$ 1 million): This activity is critical
                         to improve the ownership and implementation of the new procurement system. Training will be supported by the Project to familiarize
                         stakeholders with the new procurement system.
                         •         Support the development and the operationalization of a ‘Hotline’ to handle procurement complaints (US$ 0.3 million).

                         Sub-component 3: Enhanced payroll and personnel management capacity (US$ 1.0 Million)

                                    This activity aims to address identified deficiencies in the public service management system, including the existence of a high
                         numbers of ghost workers and thus the ineffective use of wage bill resources. It responds to the identified need to strengthen HRM and payroll
                         management processes as noted in the AFRITAC report. Assistance provided will build on the ‘automated payroll system’ which was established
                         under the previous TGCB project.
                                    While installation of an integrated payroll and HRM system was largely completed under the previous project, some of the
                         accompanying activities, in particular installation of installed software to permit effective career management and HR records keeping and the
                         training of staff at the Ministry of Public Service, remain to be completed. Work will focus on:
                         •          Completing the civil service master file system and related training (US$ 500,000);
                         •          Training of staff on using new instruments (US$ 500,000).
                         Sub-component 4: Extending RBM Approach to address budget and program implementation problems: (USD 0.8 million)
                         A pilot approach to building Results Based Management practices in the Congolese administration was conducted under the previous
                         Governance project, focusing on the Ministry of Civil Service. The pilot approach was based on the Rapid Results methodology. The initial
                         evaluation of results conducted in June 2011 showed the strong potential of this approach as teams were able to address the concrete issues
                         identified within set timeframes. Considering the political commitment at the highest level to introducing results based management practices in
                         the Republic of Congo, and the experience gained through the pilot, it was decided to scale up this work in the next phase of implementing
                         governance reforms and to extend it to a further six ministries (Planning, Finance, Health, Transport, Energy, Trade, Civil Service, and SME). It
                         was also decided that the issues to be addressed using RRA, would be those that critically affect their ability to execute their budgets and
                         investment projects under their responsibility (Activity 1).

                         In a second phase, the experience gained during the Rapid Results Initiative pilots would be used to define and roll out a performance

                         management framework, including the development of an M&E framework linking at all levels within the ministry concerned, performance targets
                         to outputs to be delivered under the ministry’s budget, and linking them to performance targets for units and the design of a capacity building
                         program, and provision of related training.

                         Component 2: Strengthened Capacity of Accountability Structures ($3.5 million)

                         This component has two sub-components:

                         Sub-component 2.1: Supporting the Independent Observatory on Governance and the Anti-Corruption Commission US$ 1.5 million)

                         The project will provide technical assistance and training to enhance the capacity of the Independent Observatory on Governance and the
                         Government Anti-Corruption Commission to monitor governance and anti-corruption measures. Technical assistance will be focused on the two
                         following areas: Budget and Procurement. A training program will be prepared. Further investment in capacity development is required to
                         ensure both institutions fully play their role in the accountability system. The Independent Observatory on Governance is an independent
                         structure created in 2007 to monitor and evaluate progress made by the Government in the implementation of anti-corruption measures. The
                         Anti-Corruption Commission, created in 2004 and restructured in 2007, is responsible for implementation of the Government Anti-corruption
                         policy. Both these structures are funded by the government. The previous Project provided capacity building support to both structures, and
                         continued support is required to enhance their internal governance, transparency and effectiveness.

                         Sub-component 2.2: Demand for Good Governance (US$ 2, 0 million)
                         The Project will also provide technical assistance and training to reinforce the capacity of selected national NGOs to monitor and evaluate
                         implementation of key public reforms. The capacity building activities to be financed under this sub-component will allow the NGOs to:

                         -         Monitor the governance reforms underway and inform the population of the issues regarding public finance, procurement and other
                         reforms;
                         -        Gather feedback from the population concerning their experience and level of satisfaction regarding the quality of public services, how
                         to implement the reforms and how to improve national development strategies.
                         -        Monitor and analyze implementation of the national budget and how to advocate with the Parliament to ensure the budget reflects local
                         needs and priorities.
                         -        Collaborate with the existing anti-corruption structures to establish an effective coalition to pursue transparency, accountability and
                            integrity in public administration.

                            The national NGOs and the media will be selected based on objective criteria and will prepare action plans. In addition to technical assistance
                            and training, the Project will support them in disseminating the results of their analysis and monitoring of their activities. As the Bank has much
                            less leverage to pressure the Government to continue implementing reforms, such support will be extended to public accountability structures,
                            such as Economic and Finance Committee in Parliament, the Supreme Audit Authority, and the State Inspector General. Selected NGOs and
                            media will, as a condition of receiving the TA and training, be required to (a) prepare proposals for the TA they wish to receive and an action plan

                            for applying the TA they receive to specific activities designed to enhance the monitoring and evaluation of public finances and services and
                            dissemination of the results of the monitoring and evaluation; and (b) enter into agreements with the Recipient undertaking to carry out their
                            action plans.

                            Component 3: Monitoring and Evaluation system (US$ 3.0 million)

                            This component will support the government of Congo in the development and institutionalization of monitoring and evaluation functions and
                            systems at national level and targeted sectors. Congo has no results-based M&E functions built-in as part of the duties and responsibilities of the
                            public administration. Production, management and user of performance information in government decision-making and accountability
                            processes are very week and there is a lack of sufficient, timely and reliable information to monitor budget planning implementation of programs
                            and accountability processes. More specially, the project will support the following activities:

                            •           Design and implementation of a national monitoring and evaluation system: The project will finance (i) the development of a
                            Government evaluation strategy with the necessary policy guidelines for implementation; (ii) preparation of arrays of indicators for economic and
                            finance programs; (iii) design and implementation of an evaluation agenda with the Government ministries. The Ministry of Planning will play a
                            key role as it will also coordinate the development of a M&E system for the PRSP second generation.
                            •           Implementation support to the Project Coordination Unit including the Project Coordinator, a Finance Manager, an accountant, a
                            finance officer, a procurement specialist, internal auditor, and a monitoring & evaluation (M&E) specialist. The project will also provide resources
                            for training in relevant areas for staff of relevant Ministries, as well as resources to recruit consultants with specific expertise as needed.

                            The World Bank’s contribution to the proposed operation will be a small IDA amount (US$ 5 million) with US$ 21,3 million from the Government
                            to move the agenda reform in PFM, Public Procurement and Accountability.
