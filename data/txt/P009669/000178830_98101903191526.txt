INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REFORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO IHE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
FROPOSED CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA
FOR A RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to India in an amount equivalent to US$75.0 million on standard
IDA terms for a railway project.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        Since 1949, the Bank has made 40 loans amounting to US$1,111
million and the Association 36 development credits amounting to US$1,571
million (both net of cancellations) to India. Of these amounts, US$498
million has been repaid and US$559   million is still undisbursed.   Two
further credits for agricultural credit in Mysore (US$40 million) and
Gorakhpur fertilizer expansion (US$10 million) have been approved by
the Executive Directors on December 21, 1971 but have not been signed.
The share of agricultural projects in Bank/IDA operations has increased
substantially in the last two years, reflecting the high priority which
the Government accords to agriculture in the current Fourth Five-Year
Plan (1969-74), and agricultural lending is expected to account for a
large share of future Bank Group assistance, although finance of invest-
ments in industry, transport and public utilities will continue to be
important. Support to education and family planning is also planned,
but here the scope for lending is limited. During the remainder of
this fiscal year, I expect to be ready to present for your consider-
ation three agricultural projects, four industrial projects, another
transport project, a power project and a family planning project.
3.        The Bank and the Association have made six loans and four
credits to the Indian Railways (IR) amounting to US$631 million (net
of cancellations) of which about US$125 million has been repaid. The
last credit to IR (US$55 million) was approved in 1969 and has been
fully disbursed. Other Bank Group lending for transportation in India
comprises three loans and one credit for the ports of Calcutta, Madras
and Bombay (US$82 million), one credit for roads (US$60 million) and
one loan for civil aviation (US$5.6 million). In addition, through
the six indastrial imports credits approved between 1964 and 1970,
a total of about US$130 million has been provided to assist local
production of commercial vehicles. A shipping project and a second
highways project are currently under consideration.
4.        A summary statement of loans and credits as of November 30,
1971, is in Annex I. Comments on the status of disbursements of
effective loans and credits were given in my recent Report and Recom-
mendation on a Proposed Loan to the Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation of India Limited (P-988, dated October 13, 1971). There
have been no significant changes since that report.



5.        Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in India totalling
US$42.3 million, of which US$3.3 million has been repaid, US$5.9 million
sold and US$6.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$26.8 million,
US$18.6 million represents loans and US$8.2 million equity. The largest
commitment to date has been US$18.9 million to Zuari Agro-Chemical for
a fertilizer plant in Goa. A summary statement of IFC loans as of
November 30, 1971 is in Annex I.
6.        The proposed project was appraised in March/April 1971 and
negotiations took place in Washington, D.C. in November. The Borrower
was represented at the negotiations by Mr. B. S. D. Baliga, Chairman
of the IR Board, Mr. K. S. Sundara Rajan, Financial Commissioner,
Indian Railways, Mr. A. Choudhury, Director of Planning, Indian Railways
and Mr. S. Guhan, Special Assistant to the Planning Minister.
PART II - THE ECONTOYY
7.        An economic report entitled "Economic Situation and Prospects
of India" (SA-25a), dated May 11, 1971, was distributed to the Executive
Directors on May 24, 1971. A memorandum entitled "India: Major Economic
Issues" (R71-249, dated November 9, 1971) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on November 9, 1971. A country data sheet is attached as
Annex II.
8.        In the period following the recession of 1966-68, the Indian
economy has grown at an annual rate of about 5 percent, largely reflect-
ing the encouraging progress of agriculture. Foodgrain production in
the last crop year reached 108 million tons, which is 8.5 percent above
the level of the preceding year.  This is due in part to substantial
investment in irrigation and also to the increased and more effective use
of current inputs, such as improved seeds, fertilizer and pesticides.
But weather remains an important factor both in agriculture and - because
agriculture contributes nearly half of India's GNP - determining overall
economic growth.
9.        Manufacturing now contributes about 20 percent of GNP.  India's
current Five-Year Plan (1969-74) aims at an overall annual growth of
5.5 percent, and an increase in manufacturing output by about 8 to 10
percent a year in both the organized and the small-scale industrial
sectors. Medium and large-scale industrial production rose by about
7 percent in both 1968 and 1969 and by just over 5 percent in 1970.
The main reasons for this setback appear to have been shortages of raw
materials, especially steel and cotton, and low public investment caused
by restrictive budget policies.  In contrast, small-scale firms seem
to have benefited directly from the advance of agriculture and have made
considerable gains.
10.       The Government has followed strict budgetary and monetary
policies in recent years and net foreign exchange reserves are now just
over one billion dollars. During 1967-71, imports (especially of food)



- 3 -
came down sharply, and in 1970.-71, exports increased by over 8 percent.
As a result, India's trade deficit has decreased from US$1.3 billion
equivalent in FY 1967 to US$130 million equivalent in FY 1971.
11.       A major cause of concern, and an important constraint for the
future, has been the low rate of investment. Net investment was 12 percent
of national income in FY 1970 against nearly 15 percent in FY 1966. Public
sector investment is being held back by lack of funds, for, although sub-
stantial amounts were raised through higher taxation, public savings did
not increase sufficiently to maintain the investment rate in the face of
the sharp decline in net aid receipts, from US$800 million in 1966/67 to
about US$300 million in 1970/71.
12.       Early this year the basis was being laid for substantial expansion
of investment activity, but evonta intervened bafore economic d:vevlop-
ment could benefit from these efforts. From the beginning oI the fiscal year
(April), large numbers of refugees started coming across Indiats Eastern
borders.  By November, the budgetary cost of caring for the refugees this
year was estimated at US$700 million. Toward these costs, the international
community had by early December committed about US$250 million in aid. From
December 3 to 16, there was open conflict in the subcontinent. The direct
and indirect implications of this conflict for economic development in India
cannot yet be assessed definitively. Present indications are, however, that
the development process is continuing without untoward disruptions, and funds
allocated in the budget for development purposes are being provided on
schedule.
13.       The transport sector plays an important role in the Indian
economy. While it accounts for only some 4 percent of GNP, it absorbs
about 30 percent of total national investment. Transport subsidies form
part of the Government's policy of stimulating growth in relatively un-
developed regions, and taxes on petroleum products (which are largely used
in the transport sector) amount to about one-quarter of Central Government
tax revenues. Indian Railways have provided the dominant mode of transport
in past years, carrying about one-half of all passenger and two-thirds of
total goods traffic. The importance of the railways can be seen from the
following statistics: they account for about 1.5 percent of GNP; they
employ some 8 percent of the total labor force in enterprises with more
than 25 employees; they consume about 30 percent of steel, 20 percent of
coal, and 10 percent of high speed diesel fuel used in the entire economy;
in addition to being the most important traffic carrier, they operate large
manufacturing facilities with a total annual output of over Rs. 500 million;
and in the period 1965/69, they accounted for about 50 percent of total
investment in the transport sector.
14.       The pattern of transportation has, however, begun to shift in
recent years, mainly due to an accelerated expansion of the road transport
system. Road traffic has grown fastest in fields such as the movement of
high value general goods, in which railways are at a comparative disadvantage.
These trends may well continue, for in the Fourth Plan the Government has
decreased the share of railways investment to about one-third of the total
allocation for transport. However, the railways will continue to exercise
a near monopoly over other major types of transport service, particularly
heavy freight and bulk goods, and the overall rate of growth of railway
traffic is likely to be of the order of 3 percent per annum for the fore-
seeable future.

PART III - THE PROJECT
15.        A report entitled "Appraisal of an Eleventh Railway Project,
India" (PTR-96a), dated November 30, 1971, is circulated separately.
A Credit and Project Surmary is contained in Annex III.
16.        The project consists of new and on-going works in IR's invest-
ment program for the three years beginning April 1, 1971 (which complete
IR's Fourth Five-Year Plan), and is a continuation of the previous IDA
financed railway project, which covered the first two years of the Plan.
It will enable IR to meet projected increases in freight and passenger
traffic and to continue nodernizing the system and also to reduce
operating costs.
17.        Investments during the three-year period will total Rs. 8.133
billion (Us$i.o84 billion). Of the total investment during the period,
40 percent will cover diesel and electric locomotives and rolling stock,
42 percent in track renewal and line capacity works, 6 percent in line
electrification and the balance in various other works. Almost half of
the funds required (US$522 million equivalent) would be provided from
internally generated funds of the railways. The Government would con-
tribute US$473 million equivalent as capital-at-charge, including the
proceeds of the proposed credit and other foreign borrowing. A small
balance ould be covered by temporary loans from the Government.
18.       The foreign exchange component of the investment program is
estimated at US$170 million equivalent (16 percent of total project
costs), consisting primarily of raw materials and components required
for the manufacture of locemotives and rolling stock. Available
bilateral loans and credits amount to US$28.3 million and a further
US$30 million is in prospect. Including drawings of US$25 million under
the tenth railway credit (162-IN) during April to August 1971, IDA's
total contributlon to the program would be US$100 million, or 59 percent
of total foreign exchange requirements. A balance of US$11.7 million
equivalent would come from the Government's foreign exchange resources.
19.       The proposed credit would be disbursed against imports of
components and materials for the manufacture of locomotives and rolling
stock (US$56 million), imports of equipment and materials for route
improvement works (US$15 million), and miscellaneous workshop and main-
tenance equipment (US$4 million).  Imports financed by the IDA credit
will be procured through international competitive bidding except for a
limited amount for imported components for the assembly of railway equip-
ment under licences and certain items which the railways intend to
procure from particular sources in the interest of essential standardi-
zation. The total amount for these standardized items is estimated at
US$17 million which would remain the upper limit for this component of
the credit, even if funds were to be reallocated among the agrecd categories
of items to be financed out of the credit.



20.       At the time when the project was first scheduled, it was
envisaged that disbursements of the proposed credit would follow
immediately on the previous railway credit, which covered expenditures
made by IR through August 1971. Howqever, there has been some delay in
completion of the appraisal so that some expenditures on items included
under the proposed credit have already been incurred. In the circum-
stances, I propose   that expenditures incurred on and after September 1,
1971, up to US$5.5 million equivalent be covered by the proposed credit.
21.       A detailed economic evaluation of the project as a whole has
not been possible because of the large number of sub-projects involved
and the difficulty of quantifying in a meaningful way the costs and
benefits associated with numerous small items. Evaluation of five large
sub-projects shows rates of return of about 20 percent for the dieseli-
zation program and track doubling of an important railway line, 1.1 per-
cent for a typical example of signalling improvement, and 10 percent for
the modernization of an important marshalling yard. The electrification
of a section of main line, which is part of an on-going program, is
estimated to yield a 6 percent rate of return, but it was not possible
to evaluate satisfactorily a number of important benefits which might
have been included in the analysis.
22.       The Indian Railway system is the second largest under one
management in the world, exceeded in size only by the railways of the
USSR. The total system covers approximately 60,000 route kilometers.
The organization of the railways is complex. The system consists of
nine railway zones, each under a general manager reporting directly to
the Railway Board. Formal jurisdiction over the railways is vested in
the Ministry of Railways of the Central Government. The management of
the railway's operations is sound and the rate of equipment utilization
conpares favorably with other railway systems. The need and opportuni-
ties for improvement in operating efficiency and in quality of service
is recognized by the Railway Board and studies are being made in a
number of directions to this end.
23.       Financial results are satisfactory, with a rate of return on
average capital-at-charge at 4.7 percent in 1969/70 and 4.4 percent in
1970/71. Revenues from freight and passenger traffic have been rising
at an average rate of 6.9 percent per annum from 1966/67 to 1970/71.
However, operating expenses, especially wages, have also risen sharply
in these years; they increased by as much as 9.6 percent in 1966/67
and have since gone up by about 7 percent annually on the average. Thus,
the operating ratio (i.e. operating costs as a percentage of gross
revenues) has risen from 79.5 percent in 1965/66 to 84.4 percent in
1970/71 and net revenues have been insufficient to cover the dividend
which IR is obligated to pay to the Government. The main reasons for
the increase of the operating ratio have been the unexpectedly slow
growth of profitable freight traffic while passenger traffic, part of
which has to be subsidized by other operations, has grown steadily.
Furthermore, IR has not been able to obtain Government agreement to com-
pensate fully for wage and other cost increases through corresponding
rate increases.



2b.       An operating ratio of 80 percent was agreed as an appropriate
target figure for IR's performance under the last railway credit. On
July 1, 1971, IR increased its rates and these adjustments should result
in the operating ratio declining to about 80 percent by the end of IR's
fiscal year 1973, provided that substantial further increases in
salaries and wages, likely in 1972, are covered by further rate adjustments
or economies in operation. In these circumstances, it has been agreed
that the railways would be required to maintain rates and fares at a level
that would generate revenues sufficient to cover, in addition to operating
expenses, the dividend payable to Government on capital-at-charge. The
dividend is at present 5.5 percent on capital contributions received prior
to March 31, 1964 and 6 percent on capital contributions received there-
after.
25.       In assessing IR's financial performance, IR's role in the
economy must be taken into account. IR's dividend to the Government
represents about 3 percent of the Government's total current and capital
receipts. IR also generates sufficient internal resources to finance
about 50 percent of its capital expenditures. More importantly, the
Indian Railways retain a labor force of about 1.35 million; a large
number of these employees are redundant, and the number would be higher
if the railways had a free hand in adopting a higher level of mechani-
zation. In addition to the payroll cost of this labor, the railways have
to provide social services to employees and their families (about seven
million people). At the same time, the railways carry the financial
burden of certain social services which are unremunerative, such as
commuter lines in major cities and a large number of small branch lines.
The cost of these services have been identified and are now being re-
flected in the railway's annual accounts. The question of providing
some degree of compensation to the railwiays for uneconomic services is
expected to be referred to Parliament and some relief is likely.
26.       Investment planning by the railvays has been carried out in
five-year stages and has been concentrated on short-term development.
The proper determination of long-term investment and investment priorities
requires a longer plan horizon which could serve as a framework for the
more specific five-year investment plans. The railways will embark on
the preparation of a fifteen year corporate plan which would be more in
line with the average life of typical railway assets and would moreover
provide a basis for more effective coordination of investments among
different modes of transport. Within the context of the corporate plan
the railways will further refine their traffic forecasting procedures
as well as the techniques employed in the appraisal of major sub-projects.
27.       Related to the issue of investment planning is the question of
transport coordination. This is especially pressing in a transport
system the size of India's and in a situation where pricing and regulation
of services are determined by wider economic goals, such as employment,
generation of public savings and income re-distribution. The Government
is aware of the need for effective transport coordination. A committee



- 7 -
on Transport Policy and Coordination produced a comprehensive report in
1966 wihich led to a variety of measures designed to ensure continuous
adjustments of pricing and planning among different modes of transport.
A number of other bodies have also been appointed at various times to
examine more specific issues such as the effect of taxation on road
transport. However, there is no single minister or other authority
expressly charged with setting policy and resolving conflicts, and as a
result the recormmendations contained in these reports have not been
implemented. Moreover, the fact that competition has increased TNithin
the transport sector, primarily due to the greater use of road transport,
has made critical the need for effective coordination and planning. The
Government has decided to undertake a full review of the transport sector
and the Association will contribute to this review by means of a compre-
hensive sector mission.  It is ex.pected that this review would take
approximately eighteen months and would lead to an understanding between
the Government and the Association on the basic policies to be followed
in the sector as a framewzork for future Bank Group activity in India's
transport sector.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
28.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Association and the
Govermnent of India, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Articie V, Secticn l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of the
Resol;otimn cczicerning the proposed credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
29.       I am satisfied that the proposed developmnent credit will comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOT114ENDATION
30.       I recommiend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
