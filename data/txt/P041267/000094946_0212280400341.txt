3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The project's primary objective as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) was to rehabilitate critical
components of the country's road and civil aviation infrastructure; secondarily, the project sought to
improve institutional capacity in the roads and civil aviation sectors for planning and maintenance of
existing infrastructure assets. The project was designed to address the needs in the country's transport
sector, arising both out of damages suffered in the civil war (May-June 1994) and from neglect of road
maintenance which made it necessary to reconstruct some sections of the road network.
3 2 Revised Objective.
The fundamental objective in the SAR remained unchanged throughout the life of the project. The project
was slightly restructured following the midterm review, by shifting resources from one of the road
rehabilitation projects to cover urgent additional requirements at the Aden Intemational Airport.
3.3 Original Coomponents:
Part A: Roads
Road Rehabilitation of two key roads: (i) Hodeidah-Salif (65 kIn), connecting the new Port of Salif to the
main road network at Hodeidah; and (ii) Am Ayn - Naqabah (100 kIn). the main link between Aden and
Mukalla and carrying all traffic between the eastemn region and the rest of the country.
Equipment, Software and Training, directed at the Yemeni Board for the Management of the Road
Maintenance Fund (YBRMF) to operationalize a system for road maintenance management.
Technical Assistance, involvuig three activities: (i) a study for planning and prioritizing maintenance
needs, including condition assessment of some 2,000 km of the main road network, and the development of
detailed designs for the worst 800 kIn; (ii) technical Assistance to the YBRMF, in implementing its
maintenance program, and (iii) construction supervision, and implementation supervision of the above
sub-components.
Part B: Civil Aviation
Emergency Rehabilitation of the Aden International Airport (AIA), in response to serious damage
incurred during the civil war (May-June 1994), including: (i) AIA Terminal Reconstruction; and (ii) New
Control Tower and Technical Building.
Equipment including: (i) commnunications and navigational aids, with expected co-financing from France;
and (ii) fire fighting vehicle with accessories and spare parts.
Technical Assistance, consisting of: (i) Civil Aviation Strategy and Policy Study, which would review
institutional problems, arising notably from the merging of civil aviation institutions from the North and the
South; and the financial difficulties facing the Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority (CAMA); and
(ii) Technical Assistance for Design and Supervision of works at the Aden International Airport described
above.
3.4 Revised Components
The basic components described above remained the same throughout the project life.  However, two
modifications to the DCA were carried out. The first, in October 1997, responded to a change in
institutional responsibility for the implementation of the works, inventory and design of priority road
improvements, from the Ministry of Construction to the GCRB (at that time the Roads Authority). The
second, in November 1999, involved a reallocation of funds from one of the two road rehabilitation
projects, to the Aden Intemnational Airport. Three additional activities were also taken up with project
funds: (i) design of slope stability, rock fall protection and Wadi Mawr Bridge on the Harad-Huth Road, to
address safety concemns due to falling rock on a road previously financed under the Multi-Modal Transport
- 2 -



Project (Credit 2177-YEM); (ii) Initial design, preparation and start-up of the follow on project, Rural
Aczess Project (RAP); and (iii) Road Sector Management Review, which was agreed upon at Mid-term
review, to better address the institutional, managerial and financial issues in the sector.
3.5 Qualhty at Entry
Quality at entry is considered to be satisfactory, based on thr following factors:
Relevance to CAS. The project supported three major CAS objectives: (i) restoring key economic
infiastructure; and (ii) supporting stabilization through structural reforms; and (iii) improving portfolio
implementation and sustainability. The later two would be addressed by supporting road maintenance and
maaagement institutions that would also promote more efficient use of scarce public resources. The
achievement of independently financed road maintenance operations through user charges would promote
ma ,ro-economic stabilization by reducing the Govemment's budget devoted to financmg road maintenance.
Go vernment Priorities and Commitment. The project was designed in line with stated Government
priorities. This was manifested in two policy letters-one for the Road Sector and one for the Civil Aviation
Sector. However, the institution-strengthening components attempted to chart a new direction for sector
ma iagement through fundamental sector reform, and this brought the client into uncharted waters.
Project Design.  Given the Bank's long history in the sector and ongoing knowledge of the actors, the
unc erlying assumptions for the project design were essentially sound. The objectives as stated in the SAR
are clear and focused. They take into account past Bank efforts in the transport sector going back to 1970,
and pay particular attention to the need for institution and capacity building. The project sought to learn
froin past experience, notably the need for simplicity in design and straightforward procurement
pro ,edures.
Prcject Risk. Given that the primary objective of the project was emergency reconstruction, the major
risks identified in SAR were potential implementation delays and uncertain cofinancing by the French
Government. Procurement delays were definitely encountered, but the project strategy of consolidating
ICE; contracts proved effective, once underway. In retrospect, a major risk was whether the Government
woi ild seriously pursue the sector reforms which had been agreed upon during preparation, and which were
confirmed in the Government's policy letters emitted at that time and included in the SAR.
Regdiness for Implementation. Despite the initial positive assessment of procurement capabilities and
proicurement sessions during the project launch, the implementing agencies, particularly CAMA, had
clearly not fully assimilated Bank guidelines, as evidenced by procurement difficulties resulting in long
delE ys.
Saf.-guard Policies. The project was rated as category B in the SAR. A similar rating would be applied
todiy. The SAR included an abbreviated mitigation and monitoring plan. Although this level of analysis
was considered sufficient at the time, it would be insufficient under current Safeguard Policies, not having
carried out Category B environmental and social assessments for the two known road investments and not
expi icitly addressing the possibility of resettlement or social issues.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4 1 Outconie/achievement of objective.
The achievement of objectives and outputs is judged to be, on balance, satisfactory. The physical
rehabilitation objectives were all met within the credit's time frame. A significant road section (Hodeidah -
Salif road) has been improved and the Aden International Airport is now fully rehabilitated and functional.
The quality of the works in both cases is high. Funding for the other planned road improvement was
secured through the follow-on project (Rural Access Program cofinanced by IDA) and bidding for these
works was underway in October 2002. When co-financing for airport works from the French did not
materialize, the Government stepped in to provide this financing.
On the other hand, the project has not had the intended outcomes in respect of its support for institutional
reform. For the road sector, the Ministry of Public Works and Urban Development (MPPWUD) has
progressively brought the Road Maintenance Fund (YBRMF) and GCRB (government-owned contractor
for road works) closer under its direct control and management. This is contrary to the letter and spirit of
the policy letter and law creating the Road Maintenance Fund. Although a law to raise the fuel levy was
passed by Parliament, it was not implemented as of November 2002. A Road Sector Review Study to
address these issues was deemed unsatisfactory. Similarly, the project has had little or no direct impact on
improving management of the civil aviation sector, since the planned mitial institutional study never took
place. There were also major procurement difficulties with CAMA, although once underway, this
component proceeded well.
While the shortcomings on the institutional side are disappointing, they are weighed agamst the successful
accomplishment of key infrastructure rehabilitation within the original time frame, which was the primary
objective of the project. Even on institutional issues, the project has been instrumental in raising awareness
of the fundamental issues in improved sector management and putting in place some of the institutions and
operational tools for improved planning and maintenance. The Bank has continued its persistent dialogue in
this matter. On its own, CAMA has moved ahead to increase revenues, in compliance with a main Project
covenant, principally through overflight fees, and indications are that CAMA is trying to move toward a
more commercial approach. In view of the fact that the primary objective was rehabilitation, the poor
institutional performance would not seem sufficient to render an unsatisfactory rating for the project as
whole.
4.2 Outputs by components.
Part A: Roads
Road Rehabilitation. This component is rated highly satisfactory. The upgrading of the Hodeidah-Salif
Road was completed with a small delay of two months and within budget. The ICR mission visited the road
in September 2002 and was impressed with the good quality and condition of the road, three months
following the end of the one year defects liability period. The design and tender documents for Am Ayn -
Naqabah Road were prepared under the TRP. As noted, the implementation of works was deferred, so as to
free up funds for urgent runway rehabilitation needs at Aden International Airport. The works will now be
funded under Part B of the Rural Access Project. Reduced cost is due to re-allocation of funds for
unforeseen repairs in the Aden Airport under Part B.
Technical Assistance, Equipment and Training to Yemen Board for Management of the Road
Maintenance Fund (YBRMF). On balance, this component is rated as unsatisfactory. In compliance with
- 4 -



c,ne of the Project covenants, the YBRMF was created in 1995. The TA carried out an institutional review
End assisted in putting in place the basic tools for road network maintenance and management, including a
lunctional Pavement Management System (PMS). The project also provided computer equipment and
i onmal training for GCRB and YBRMF staff. The YBRMF has a cadre of staff who have knowledge and
e xperience in a range of the activities involved with road network maintenance and management. The PMS
i3 capable of generating annual work programs on some 5,000 km of the Main Road Network. Despite
these accomplishments, the YBRMF has lost its status as being independently funded through user fees,
becoming an implementation arm of the Ministry. Consequently, its credibility as an autonomous agency
capable of implementing coherent annual work programs for network management has suffered. In
z ddition, a procurement for eleven weighpads to control axle loads was never completed, due to
disagreements between the YBRMF and the World Bank regarding the award of the contract. The Bank
took issue with the Funds placing what it considered undue weight to minor specification requirements
"BRMF on the other hand, felt these issues, related to delivery requirements, were justified. YBRMF
conducted a stakheholders' workshop to promote compliance with axle load controls on the road network.
D)etailed Design of Priority Improvements. This component is rated as satisfactory. The originally
planned allocation of 800 km was reduced to 595 km, because the initial cost estimates were insufficient.
WVhile some delays were experienced in awarding this contract, once awarded, it proceeded smoothly and
produced a high quality output. Although there was no Bank funding available to implement these projects,
the RMF has proceeded to fund three road sections.
Road Sector Review. This component is rated as unsatisfactory. The consultant's draft report was poorly
vritten and did not clearly specify and address the underlying problems in the existing road sector. While
the participatory approach used by the consultant was good in principle, the senior staff from MPWUD
(learly dominated the process and ended up imposing a solution which would not change very much, but
rather add an additional structure (Roads Policy Board) which would again be dominated by the MPWUD.
1'his approach led to a "wish list" type output, rather than carrying out an objective analysis of the
erformance of the current institutional setup, and working with the stakeholders to recommend operational
improvements to achieve that performance. It is an example of a participatory process gone wrong. The
outcomes are not accepted by other stakeholders, and certainly not by the donor community which is
expected to provide substantial financing for the road sector in the future.
l'art B: Civil Aviation
Emergency Rehabilitation of the Aden International Airport (AIA) and Equipment. This component
is rated as satisfactory. It was essentially delayed by two years, because the borrower did not follow the
Bank procurement regulations as agreed in the DCA, both for the consultant and contractor contracts.
I owever, once the Bank regulations were followed as agreed, work progressed efficiently. Cofinancing by
France never materialized for certain safety equipment, and the CAMA and MOF should be given credit
ibr assuming this cost of about US$ 5.0 million.
Civil Aviation Strategy and Policy Study. The output for this component is rated as unsatisfactory. The
.tudy never got off the ground. It was initially delayed due to the procurement delays associated with the
AIA design consultants and contractor. Then, following a change in Chairman of CAMA, there were
lurther discussions on the terms of reference in September 2000. At that time, the study was planned for
January 2001, but CAMA would carry out an internal policy and institutional assessment m the meantime.
A year later, the RFP was sent out to short-listed consultants, but the tender was never awarded. CAMA
Itow says this study may be taken up by the Arab Fund Sana'a Airport credit.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return*
The IRR was calculated for two traffic growth scenarios, based on projected development of the two ports.
The rates of return were 8 and 11 percent for the two scenarios, yielding a slightly positive NPV at a
discount rate of 10 percent for scenario 2. These results are quite different than the ones found in the SAR.
The divergence is due largely to the huge difference in the traffic volumes estimated for the base year of
1996. In view of the observed counts in 1997 and 2002, the SAR estimates appear over-optimistic.
However, the road investment should not be seen in isolation, but as part of the development of the two
ports at Salif and Ras Issa. Thus, despite the marginal rates of return, the investment can reasonably be
justified as a necessary pre-condition for a wider set of productive and employment-generating investments
in the two ports. See Annex 3 for full analysis.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
N.A.
4.5 Institutional development impact
The project's institutional development impact can be considered moderate. For the roads sector, the
project has established a basic capability to carry out road network management at the YBRMF. However,
this capability has remained underutilized, because the Government has not enacted the law for increased
fuel levy and the tendency to consider the Fund as a financing arm of the MIPWUD's investment program.
As a result, the Fund has not been able to truly implement, test and improve on the methods and programs
introduced by the project. It may be suggested that the Project sowed the seed for sector reform, which
grew somewhat, but certainly not to fruition. However, by establishing a transition stage with a follow on
project, the dialogue has continued, and holds a real possibility for achieving the desired results under the
follow on project. For the civil aviation sector, the rehabilitation of basic infrastructure and installation of
essential safety equipment have rendered the AIA operational. Without this investment, the airport would
have no chance in attracting international flights and becoming a sustained revenue-generating operation. It
is now preparing for an ICAO safety inspection in January 2003, and has nommated an air traffic safety
committee. Without the project investments, the CAMA could not even think of taking these measures. The
project has had little impact on the development of revised strategy and organizational plan for the civil
aviation sector, since the study was never undertaken.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5 I Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency.
The intemational climate for investment and tourism travel was not favorable for Yemen, especially
following the 9/11 events. This has made it more difficult for the Aden Intemational Airport to credibly
attract more traffic and make maximum use of the new facilities. The SDR exchange rate to the US dollar
decreased during the life of the project, from: SDR 1 = US$ 1.5; to: SDR 1 = US$ 1.25, which decreased
available dollar amounts by about 16%.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The borrower's commitment to sector reforms was weak. Although the Parliament met its obligation to pass
a law raising the fuel levy, the law did not account for a rise in the overall fuel price, a technicality which
resulted in the Government not enacting the law until today. In addition, the Government has departed
from the original concept of an autonomous road maintenance agency, by considering RlvIF as an arm of
the Ministry of Public Works, which has also hampered the RMF's ability to play its real role of road
network manager. With respect to the Aden Intemational Airport, the High Tender Board departed from
Bank guidelines, which led to successive delays in the procurement process of about two years. However,
- 6 -



once these were solved, the project works proceeded well and within the project period.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control.
Performance of implementing agencies has been mixed. The PMU/Roads showed generally good
management of the road upgrading, supervision contracts and technical studies. Although the YBRMF
received TA, training and logistical support, it has not been able to successfully translate its latent
-apabilities into a fully operational and independent road maintenance and management organization
Although it lost its autonomy and has unreliable financial resources, ever, it can be argued that the
management could have taken a stronger stand in asserting its independence. Also, YBRMF had difficulties
in successfully completing the procurement of the weigh pads under Bank guidelines. CAMA deviated
From Bank procurement guidelines, which caused considerable delays in the execution of this component.
However, the Government and CAMA should also be given credit for assuming the cost of the safety
.quipment, when the French co-financing did not materialize. With regard to the Strategy and Policy Study,
changes in leadership in CAMA led to a questioning for the need of the study in the first place, and it must
e concluded that the new leadership was simply not interested in domg this study.
5.4 Costs andfinancing
'rhe total amount of the credit has remained the same. A major reallocation was made in November 1999,
Ahich shifted SDR 5 million from one of the road projects to the Aden Airport. As of December 8, 2002,
otal disbursements amounted to SDR 22.4 million which represents 90 percent of the pnncipal loan
umount of SDR 24.7 million. Annex 10 summarizes the modifications and reallocations.
I. Sustainability
i5.1 Rationale for sustainabilhty rating
On balance, the sustainability of the project achievements is likely, due to the fact that the primary
i)bjective, infrastructure, has a good probability of being sustained. The AIA has an autonomous
management structure, its personnel have been trained in equipment operation and the airport is observed to
be operating normally, albeit with limited traffic levels. The Hodeidah - Salif Road will require minimum
maintenance over the next several years, the main routme maintenance requirement being the removal of
;and dunes. In contrast, the secondary, institutional objectives can be said to have a moderate probability of
leing sustained. This is based on the observed poor performance during the project, tempered by the
oontinued dialogue and efforts in this area under the follow on project.
i.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations.
'With respect to civil aviation, there is little need for transition arrangements. The AIA investments will
likely be well-managed, given the airport authority's past track record.  Training occurred for the
iire-fighters, and five CAMA engineers attended training in project management and runway design.
,Uthough there has been weak commitment from CAMA in carrying out the Strategy and Organization
Study, sector reforms may occur through the Arab Fund study and administrative reforms will proceed
iinanced through the European Union.
'With respect to the road sector, transitional activities are naturally flowmg through the Rural Access
Plrogram. The RAP is now financing the study to define the National Road Classification System and the
I lighway Master Plan for the Main and Strategic Road Network. The focus of these studies is to capitalize
on the road network maintenance information generated during the TRP, but as yet underutilized.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending.
The Bank's performance during project preparation was satisfactory. At the time of preparation and
appraisal, the project fit squarely with the Bank's policies and clearly responded to a national need. The
Government was assisted in the preparation activities through a high-level sector dialogue on needed
reforms, and these were articulated in two policy letters. However, later events showed that not all members
of the Government truly embraced these institutional reforms, due partly to changes in leadership and
internal political considerations. The Bank staff built on the experience of the Multi-Modal Transport
Project, which was drawmg to a close, and wisely used that project as a "bridge" to the preparation of
TRP. An early effort was made to ensure that there was a full understanding of Bank procurement
procedures through a project launch workshop. Here too, later events showed that these procedures were
not fully assimilated, which led to some procurement delays.
7.2 Supervision.
The Bank's supervision performance is judged satisfactory. The Bank staff showed flexibility and
understanding in responding to evolving needs, through reallocation of funds and assuring deferred funding
through the follow on project. The implementation arrangements in the DCA were also modified to adapt to
the Government's changing institutional structure in the road sector. The Bank staff have again used this
project as a bridge to the next, which was a good use of leftover resources under the credit. As some
changes in the road sector have diverged from the original policy letter, the Bank staff has engaged the
Government and its personnel in a patient yet persistent sector policy dialogue. It has been suggested that
the Bank could have taken a harder line on these issues, however, the divergence from original
arrangements began well into the project, such that most of the road investments had already been
accomplished, and the Bank had little leverage. For this reason, the Road Sector Management Review was
commiussioned, as a more concrete basis for further reform.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
On balance, the Bank performance was satisfactory.  It proved flexible and responsive to changing
circumstances and it has provided a forum to debate how to improve sector performance, without which
physical investments alone would be wasted. It has sought to provide continuity and build on experience
from one project to the next.

7.4 Preparation -
Performance is rated as satisfactory. The concerned implementing agencies participated in the preparation
of the project, which resulted in the policy letters for the road and civil aviation sectors and a detailed
implementation schedule. The Government diligently moved forward to satisfy the pre-conditions for
negotiations, Board presentation and credit effectiveness.
7.5 Government inzpleinentation performance:
Performance is rated overall as satisfactory, since the primary objective of physical rehabilitation was fully
achieved. However, as noted in sections 4.1 and 4.2, this success is mitigated by an apparent erosion of
commitment to agreed sector reforms and persistent procurement difficulties.
- 8 -



7.6 Iniplementing Agency:
Cverall implementing agency performance is rated as satisfactory, although individual performance is
rr ixed. The PMU/Roads successfully managed the implementation of the rehabilitation works, as well as
ti e additional technical and economic studies. The YBRMF was unable to convert its improved capacity to
fulfill its legal mandate, although it successfully met its obligation to render functional the three axle load
,Aeigh stations and has increased somewhat weigh station coverage over the road network. Although
C AMA experienced serious procurement delays, it was able to successfully supervise the improvements to
ti e Aden International Airport. It did not implement the Strategy and Policy Study, but has moved ahead on
it; own with administrative reform through other projects.
7 7 Overall Borrower performance:
Cverall borrower performance is rated as satisfactory. The mfrastructure components were highly
successful and provide a model for other projects. This success is diminshed by persistent shortcommngs in
p ocurement, and the the lack of commitment to institutional reform. On the other hand, the borrower's
a:,encies seem to appreciate the tools and methods that were established by the project and are well aware
of the need to move forward on establishing a more effective and performance-oriented institutions. This
a vareness and willingness to move forward suggests the project has laid a reasonable foundation for the
n xt project to continue this process.
8. Lessons Learned
Simplified contracting worked. The simplified formula adopted for the AIA, in which the civil works
c ntractor subcontracted the equipment, supervised by a consultant project manager, led to an efficient
inplementation of the project, with relatively limited management requirements and expenses at CAMA. A
s milar approach worked well with the road rehabilitation project, where local consultants and contractors
worked in partnership with international firms.
Address procurement problems early and continuously. Procurement problems plagued this project
f 'om the beginning and caused major delays, especially for the CAMA and YBRFM, despite procurement
vrorkshops during the project launch. It appears that one cannot expect implementing agencies to fully
assimilate the "ins and outs" of World Bank procurement guidelines through initial short courses. One way
to address this problem is to engage a full time procurement specialist in the implementing agency.
'ay more attention to efficiency and effectiveness indicators. While the project design and performance
idicators rightfully addressed sector management issues, they may have been too focused on quantitative
cbjectives for revenue-generation, while not paying enough attention to achieving efficient and effective
riianagement. The indicator on road condition, for example, does not seem to have been closely monitored
during the supervision missions. This tends to encourage the thinking that if we solve the resource problem,
all other problems will be solved. In fact, the current situation shows that both issues are closely
iiitertwined. Through technical assistance to the YBRMF, the project has established the analytical
capacity to carry out a planning, programmung and budgeting exercise, which can provide the basis for
framing the discussion of priorities on the network.
WVords and deeds in sector reform. At the beginning of the project there was cause for optimism in
sector reform. However, conflicts among agencies and changes in leadership brought about delays in
inplementation and departures from the intended original institutional goals. In the face of these changes,
-9-



the Bank and Project staff had little choice but to "hold the line" on previously agreed sector reform issues,
especially with limited leverage. In the Yemeni context, the important lesson is to maintain the dialogue,
with leverage. This is the approach taken in the RAP, where future phases of a major investment program
will be unambiguously contingent on serious road sector reform, with Bank technical assistance. It is
instructive that the Yemeni officials have remarked that they appreciate a willingness by the Bank staff to
listen to their point of view in pursuing the basic improvements in sector management.
Linkages to civil service reform. It has also been noted that true reform of the public sector will depend
on broader efforts to modernize the civil service, and is therefore linked to the Bank-fimded Civil Service
Modernization Project. In respect of the road sector, such efforts should be linked to the redefinition of
responsibilities between the public and private sectors, all within the context of decentralization. This
overall vision of sector management provides a useful framework for staking out a broad path for sector
reform, and the Civil Service Modernization Project could be seen as supporting an evolving process, to be
implemented over the long term and evaluated regularly, in view of actual performance by sector
stakeholders.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementnng agency:
There is a unanimous feeling among government officials that the TRP was a successful endeavor,
particularly in respect of: (i) carrying out emergency rehabilitation of the Aden International Airport, and of
an important road link serving the coastal areas and a two key gateway ports; (ii) establishing a network
maintenance management and planning capability at the YBRMF; and (iii) persevering with the policy
dialogue and sector support in the road sector. CAMA and the Aden Airport Authority are particularly
proud of the accomplishment at AIA and express their gratitude. CAMA also points out that it assumed
the cost of equipment, for which French financing did not materialize. CAMA indicates that the simplified
model of one contractor, who subcontracts equipment suppliers, provides a model for other projects. It
lamented not having received sufficient attention from the Bank's project supervision staff during the last
year of the project.
The PMU/Roads feels that the project was well executed and achievements are "fully sustainable." It rates
the Bank performance as "highly satisfactory." The YBRMF is very satisfied with the technical assistance
and the establishment of the Pavement Management System. While it is appreciative of the TRP in
general, it feels that the Bank was not helpful in its efforts to procure the weighpads. It also feels that in the
last year of the project, communication with Bank supervision missions was reduced.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
Summary of benefits and costs:
An ex-post evaluation of economic benefits of the physical works component of the project was carried out
using the Roads Economic Decision (RED), developed by the World Bank. The RED model is designed to
compensate for the scarcity of reliable data, normally needed for a full-fledged economic evaluation using
the HDM-model. Given data on the road conditions, vehicle fleet characteristics, and vehicle operating
costs, the RED model computes a series of roughness-vehicle operating cost (VOC) relationships by
interpolating polynomial functions of the above characteristics. These functions allow the estimation of
VOC and roughness in the "before project" situation, by entering the known average speed of vehicles on
these roads. Tests were carried out to check the reliability of those functions and the results provided by
the RED model were found be similar to those produced by HDM HI. For the "with project situation", the
road and traffic characteristics were taken from recent surveys. The costs used in the analysis were based
on the actual costs of rehabilitation, including design and supervision.
Main assumptions:
Traffic estimates
A daily traffic count was carried out at five locations along the Al Hodeidah - Al Salif Road for eighteen
hour periods on seven consecutive days, August 18 - 24, 2002. These counting stations are comparable to
counts carried out in August 1997 by the Consulting Engineer CES. The road was divided mto two major
sections: Al Hodeidah - Al Salif section and the Ras Issa spur road.
The following table summarizes the average daily traffic for the two dates, as well as that indicated in the
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR).
Average Daily Traffic(ADT) (Veh/day)
SAR            1997         2002
Car                     151            150          199
Light Bus                2              2            10
Light Truck             352             12           71
Medium Truck            108             28           17
Heavy Truck              46             4            3
Total                   659            196          300
As can be seen, there is a significant difference between the initial estimated traffic levels in the SAR and
subsequent traffic counts. The SAR did not indicate its data source. One possible explanation for these
high estimates is that the SAR estimate may have included construction traffic for the Salif Port, which was
under construction at the time (estimated traffic for trucks were particularly higher).
Comparison of the traffic counts between 1997 and 2002 revealed a 9 percent annual rate of growth. It
should be kept in mind that the road is really an extension of the port facilities at both Salif and Ras Issa.
The Salif Port is not fully developed and development of Ras Issa has not even begun. Therefore, if one
was to consider the road as one part of a series of productive investments, the historical growth in traffic
almost certainly understates potential future growth. Based on this, two scenarios for traffic growth were
assumed:
-14-



,Scenario 1:
[t is assumed that the Ras Issa terminal will be completed within 5 years, after which liquid container
raffic will account for a significant increase in the traffic. This will lead to a growth rate of 15 percent
Ifter 2006.

Jcenario 2:
'Chis scenario assumes that, in addition to the Ras Issa liquid container traffic, there is some diversion of
container traffic from Hodeidah to the Salif port. This would further increase traffic levels, leading to an
mnnual traffic growth rate after 2006 of 25 percent.

U1ser impact (VOC and Time savings):
littachment 1 summarizes the results of the analysis of benefits, quantified in terms of savings in vehicle
cperating costs (VOC) and time. The analysis shows that as a result of the road rehabilitation works, VOC
were reduced in average by 24.2% and travel time by 5% for the year 1997.
P roiect Investment Costs
T'he actual project cost includes the cost of design, supervision and construction. This amounted to US$
E .19 million, or US$126,000/km. The estimated cost in the SAR was US$ 11.5 million.
/nnual Maintenance Costs
F'inancial maintenance costs were estimated at US$ 2,000 per kilometer per year.
N et Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR):
Ihe net present value and internal rates of return were calculated for both traffic scenarios. Financial
benefits and costs were converted to economic values using a conversion factor of 85%. The following
tatble summarizes the results, as well as those presented in the SAR.
ACTUAL RESULTS                 |SAR
Scenario I             Scenario 2     |      Estimate
NPV       US$ -1.175 m   10%     US$1.030m (10%)      US$21.440      10%
IRR              8%                     11%                  38%
- 15 -



The IRR, for the two scenarios, are respectively 8 and 11 percent, yielding a slightly negative NPV in the
first scenario, and positive NPV for scenario 2. These results are quite different than the ones found in the
SAR, which showed an IRR of 38%. The divergence is due largely to the huge difference in the traffic
volumes estimated for the base year of 1996. In view of the observed counts in 1997 and 2002, the SAR
estimates appear over-optimistic.
As noted above, the road mvestment should not be seen in isolation, but as part of the development of the
two ports at Salif and Ras Issa. Thus, despite the marginal rates of return, the investment can reasonably
be justified as a necessary pre-condition for a wider set of productive and employment-generating
investments in the two ports.
Sensitivity analysis-
A sensitivity analysis was carried out, with respect to the main variable, the traffic projections. This
analysis, summarized m the table below, shows that an increase in the traffic growth rate by 25% in the
first scenario would yield a rate of return of 11 percent and 15 percent in scenario 2. A concommitant
decrease in traffic levels would reduce the rates of return to 5 percent and 8 percent in scenarios 1 and 2
respectively.
An assessment of the switching values reveals that the threshold average traffic growth rate to achieve a 10
percent rate of return in scenario I Is 14.2 percent. More complete details are provided in Attachment 2.

- 28 -



Design
The project was designed following intemational standards of highway designs following
AASHTO and BS Guidelines.
Implementation
All objectives were successfully completed.
(2)    Design of Slope Stability and Rock fall Protection works (Group I & II) on Harad-Huth
Road - Addendum (1) to Original Contract
Project Objectives
Harad-Huth Road Project was taken up for construction in September 1991 by the General
Corporation for Roads and Bridges (GCRB), Republic of Yemen (The Contractor) under the
Ministry of Planning & Development (The Employer). The project was funded by the World Bank
as Multi-Mode Transport Project (Credit 2177-YEM).
The main escarpment section mvolving the most difficult activities is at Al-Abbaisah (km 54 to km
57) of the project chainage reckoned from Al-Rad (Junction of Hodeidah-Jizan and Harad-Huth
Road).
Even during the construction stage, severe rock fall and slope stability problems were faced at
Abbaisah escarpment section between km 52+750 and km 67+400
For providing the necessary technical services consisting of detailed study, investigation and
preparation of detailed design for slope stability and rock fall protection works, M/s GCRB
commissioned the services of the Joint Venture consisting of Lowns Berger Intemational Inc.
(LBII), USA and Consulting Engineering Services (India) Limited (CES), the Consultants.
Design
The project was designed following international standards of highway designs following
AASHTO and BS Guidelines.
Implementation
The implementation of the project was taken up from Multi-Mode Transport Project and works on
the project were successfully completed with some delays due to various problems at site.
(3)    Rehabilitation Design of Wadi Mawr Bridge on Harad-Huth Road - Addendum      (2) to
Original Contract
Project Objectives
Wadi Mawr crosses the road alignment at lkn 67+410.5 over which a RCC bridge of 102.9 m
- 29 -



length (7 spans of 14.7 m each) was built. The construction of the bridge was started in May 1995
and was completed m June, 1996 when the bridge was opened to the public. As a result of heavy
floods on 8 March, 1998, major scouring took place on the wadi bed at the bridge location
resulting in complete washing away of RCC floor slab, designed and provided for protection
against scour, in 4 spans out of the 7 spans. The superstructure spans over pier P4 were found to
be visibly settled and more pronounced on the upstream side.
For providing necessary technical services in this respect, the Ministry of Construction, Housing
and Urban Planning (now renamed as Ministry of Public Works and Urban Development)
commissioned the services of Joint Venture consisting of Louis Berger Intemational Inc. (LBII),
USA and Consultmng Engineering Services (India) Limited (CES), the Consultants.
Design
The project was designed following intemational standards of highway designs following
AASHTO and BS Guidelines.
Implementation
The recommendations of the Consultants in respect of the permanent measures have not yet been
taken up.
(4)    Construction Supervision of Hodeidah-Salif Road
Implementation
After receiving 'No Objection' from the World Bank to award the contract to the lowest bidder, the
Ministry notified M/s Makiinsan-Hawk JV acceptance of their bid in the form of 'Letter of
Acceptance'. The Consultants notified the Contractor, M/s Makimsan-Hawk JV to commence the
work vide letter of Commencement.
The Contract for Rehabilitation of Hodeidah-Salif Road was awarded on 20 May 1999 to M/s
Makimsan-Hawk JV for an amount of YR. 1, 130,540,465/- with provision for escalation payment.
The Contractor, M/s Makimsan-Hawk JV completed all the works under the contract on 11 May
2001 within the stipulated contract period of 24 months in compliance with contract specification
and has maintained the road for 365 days (up to 10 May 2002).
This Final Acceptance Report/ Final Project Completion Report has been prepared after Final
Maintenance Inspection to fulfil contractual obligations of MWs LBI-CES Joint Venture with
reference to their Agreement for Consultancy Services with Government of Republic of Yemen.
The Final Project Completion cost as recommended for payment to the Contractor, M/s
Makimsan-Hawk JV is YR.1,091,821,938/-, which is well within the contract amount.
(5)    Review of Design for Rehabilitation of Al Ahmar-An Naqbah Road(115 km)
Project Objectives
The Government of the Republic of Yemen (ROY) has been considering rehabilitation of Al
- 30 -



Ahmar-An Naqbah road, a stretch (approx. 115 km long) of the main Aden-AI Mukallah Trunk
Route for quite some time. In this context, in 1997, a detailed engineering study for widening the
road to 7.0 m and rehabilitating the pavement was got done through Joint Venture Consultants,
Louis Berger International Inc. (LBII) and Consulting Engineering Services (India) Limited (CES).
The project, however, could not be taken up for implementation due to inadequacy of finances.
Since the earlier design is over four years, the government decided to take up the review of the
earlier design through M/s Consulting Engineering Services (India) Private Limited.
Design
The project was designed following international standards of highway designs following
AASHTO and BS Guidelines.
Implementation
The Government has now tied up finances for the construction of the project from Rural Access
Programme (RAP) funded by the World Bank, and wishes to proceed with implementation of the
project.
(6)    Techno-Economic and Detailed Engineering Studies for 595 km of Roads
Project Objectives
The Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning (now Ministry of Public Works and
Urban Development) engaged M/s Wilbur Smith Associates incorporated in USA and M/s
Consulting Engineering Services (India) Limited in a joint association to provide consultancy
services for Techno-Economic and Detailed Engineering Studies for 595 kilometre length of paved
roads in the Republic of Yemen (ROY). The study has the objective of rehabilitating the project

completed.
(7)    Roads Sector Review
Project Objectives
The Roads Sector Review is being carried out on behalf of the Ministry of Public Works and
Urban Development (previously the Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning). It is
funded by the World Bank as part of the 1999 Country Assistance Strategy for Yemen and as such
is closely related to the Transport Rehabilitation Project, which encompasses the Rural Roads
Project.
The purpose of the Roads Sector Review is to establish an agreed long-term strategy for the
development of Roads Section institutional and organisational arrangements to improve the
management of the complete road network throughout Republic of Yemen.
The development of such an agreed strategy for all National and Local roads, responsibility for
which is currently, and will continue to be shared between different Ministries and Administrations,
calls for close consultation and co-operation between them.
Study
The study was conducted involving different Ministries and Administrations who are involved in
the development of the Roads Sector in Yemen. Workshops on Roads Sector Review were carried
out along with technical presentations.
Implementation
The study all along progressed smoothly as per time schedule and all the reports and documents
were submitted as per the reporting requirements of the contract.
(8)    Yemen Rural Access Programme - Pilot Application of Appropriate Rural Road Standards
Project Objectives
The Rural Access Improvement Programme Project initiated by the World Bank aims at alleviating
poverty in the rural areas of Yemen by improving the access of the population to the basic services
they need.
The main objective of the pilot improvement works is to develop appropriate engineering standards
that would meet minimal technical requirements and ensure operational and safe improved roads.

_______  ________________________  Total Road  Length   113.8
The study of these roads will be supported by appropriate engineering economic, social and
environmental studies as described in the Consultants' proposal.
Implementation
The study all along progressed smoothly as per time schedule and all the reports and documents
were submitted as per the reporting requirements of the contract.
(B)    Borrower's Own Performance
Though there was change in authority/agency responsible for project design and implementation
from time to time, there was absolutely no problem in proper monitoring of the project. A
satisfactory progress in implementation of the project has been achieved.
The staff of GCRB and the Ministry of Public Works and Urban Development (earlier MOCHUP)
has developed its skills in the project management during the execution of this project.
The Audit Reports were submitted from time to time to IDA and were found to be of acceptable
quality. The overall performance of the borrower was satisfactory
(C)    Bank's Performance
IDA assisted the Government in preparing this project. During implementation, IDA monitored
and supervised this project closely. IDA's close co-operation with the Government Agencies and
the Project Implementation Unit contributes in resolving issues and ultimately resulted in
successful completion of this project within the date of Credit closure.
(D)    Proposed arrangements for continuing the project activities and sustaining their results
(i)    Hodeidah-Salif Road Project
The benefits from the Hodeidah-Salif project are likely to sustain over a longer term with proper
- 33 -



maintenance of the road stretches for which road maintenance fund and GCRB are taking active
role. The cost recovery programme is fornally in effect to generate financial needs required for
both maintenance and capital expenditure. The road being asphalted shall result in huge indirect
savings from vehicular operating cost and maintenance cost. Also the road would encourage
development of habitations and agriculture/horticulture along the route and serve to spur industrial
development in general. It would also bring to easier access to the essential supplies and services
like food, health and education.
(ii)   Design of Slope Stability and Rock fall Protection works (Group I & II) on Harad-Huth
Road - Addendum (1) to Original Contract
The slope stability and rock fall protection measures adopted at site under Group-II Works shall
overcome the problem of slope stability and falling of rocks in the project area to a great extent but
the saine needs regular maintenance to keep these measures useful in the future years as well.
Apart from thus, the escarpment areas shall also need regular maintenance of the stretch by keeping
the waterways and drains cleaned regularly so as to assure normal flow of water during the heavy
rains which seems to be a common phenomenon in the area.
It will also be necessary to protect the installed arrangements for the slope stability and rock fall
protection measures from damage/theft by the miscreants in the project area. Some acts of
vandalism have already been noticed even during the period when the work was still in progress.
(E)    Performance Indicator that will be used by the Government to continue to track the impact of
the project activities (assessment of outcome and key lesson learnt from the project)
(i)    Hodeidah-Salif Road Project
The Implementation of the project was smooth all along the construction period due to the fact that proper
design & planning was done including project management and cooperation was provided by all
authonties and local people in timely completion of the project well within the contract amount.
Therefore, the main lessons learnt from the project, to make the project successful are:
-      To identify the objectives of the project;
-      Make proper design and planning, involve institution and authorities to have their cooperation, make
social awareness among the people and finally, overall coordination with the beneficiaries and proper project
management.
(ii)   Design of Slope Stability and Rock fall Protection works (Group I & II) on Harad-Huth
Road - Addendum (1) to Original Contract
Smooth traffic flow in the escarpment section.
Reduction in number of road accidents from falling of rocks.

GOVERNMENT'S OWN ASSESSMENT
Road Maintenance Fund Component
Technical Assistance - The Yemen Board for
The Management of the Road Maintenance Fund.
The Technical Assistance related to the road sector has two main areas of focus: the TA for the
Yemen Board for the Management of the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF), training abroad and
Engineering studies to support the Road Sector in general.
The Transport Rehabilitation Project has been implemented to address the needs of the country in
restoring the transport sector damaged during the 1994 civil war and from neglect of road
maintenance.
Law No. 22 /95 and its amendment has established the Road Maintenance Fund to administer the
generated revenue from road user charges, put in place a maintenance plan, budget and
contracting capability to ensifre the restoration of the road network through effective
maintenance.
The Technical Assistance consultancy, signed on December 12, 1996 was awarded to SMEC of
Australia to ensure that objectives for the establishment of the Road Maintenance Fund are
fulfilled.
Objectives:
The objectives of the Technical Assistance were:
*     Develop operating modalities of the Board and RMF in the form of detailed regulations.
*     Prepare action plan with time steps for implementing the RMF and to make the Board and
its Executive Body operational in a short period of time. It also includes steps to expedite high
priority maintenance work in the build up period to make use of the funds already available.
*     Provide support to the Executive Body's technical and administrative units over a period
of two years and provide training of the staff to ensure effective maintenance planning,
programming and budgeting of the fund.
*     Provide support to GCRB and the local road contracting industry to improve their
operations and capacity to develop an effective capability to carry out road maintenance as
required by the RMF and in accordance with the action plan.
Overview of the Project:
Most of the requirements under the TOR have been achieved except the institutional support to
- 35 -



GCRB. It has been decided that this item is deferred until future inputs be actioned under the
recommended Road Sector Review.
The YBRMF is now established and operating in accordance with law No. 22 for 1995 and its
amendment to collect road user charges and truck overloading penalties and use those funds to
finance road maintenance expenditures.
The consultant was mobilized on the 16th Feb. 1996, and staff mobilized as follows:

The consultant undertaken extensive reviews of the YBRMF and its Executive Body as it is to
function under the law. The reports cover the full spectrum for the requirements for the
implementation of the YBRMF to develop a sustainable RMF.
Institutional Review
The consultant undertook institutional review of the YBRMF and RMF and recommended
organizational regulations to support law No. 22 -1995 to cover:
Clarification of the functions and responsibilities of the YBRMF
Institutional and operational principles for the YBRMF
*     Develop corporate plan
*     Roles and responsibilities of other authorities with respect to YBRMF
*     Draft guidelines for program development
*     Review of the Executive Body organization structure
Executive Body
The organization structure of the Executive Body has been prepared to reflect the principle
functions of the YBRMF as decreed under the law as follows:
Develop and approve RMF program and budget
Recommend appropriate increase in RUC
1.    Admimster and mange the fund to cover:
2.    Project review and approval
3.    Quality audit
4.    Program audit
- 36 -



5.    Payment from the RMF for works executed
6.    Train and develop staff
To ensure that the above functions are performed the Executive Body has been developed to
consist of three Directorates reporting to the Director General
*     Finance and Administration
*     Operations and Technical Audit
*     Program and Budget
Road Maintenance Management Systems
Designed to aid decision-making in the management of maintenance and monitoring of the road
network. It also includes the establishment of an approved road classification hierarchy and
purchase of equipment required for data collection for input into the PMS and development of a
simple Routine Maintenance Management System.
Pavement Management System (PMS)
The PMS was established to enable the Fund to determine the optimum treatment to be applied
on each individual road or at network level to make strategic decisions to set standards of
maintenance management and to advise the effect on the network under differing funding
scenario.
Routine Maintenance Management System (RMMS)
A manual RMMS was developed with the primary objective to improve the management of the
routine maintenance to be undertaken by the road authorities and will assist to obtain better value
from the available funds and existing resources for the day to day routine maintenance of the
network.
The RMMS provides:
*     Condition targets and intervention levels for maintenance of the road network as required
by the YBRMF to suit funding constraints
*     Road defect inspection requirements
*     A standard approach to routine maintenance work programming and budgeting
*     Requirements for formalized work practices for routine maintenance activities
*     The means to plan and measure productivity gains
*     The ability to compare the performance of different contractors to measure efficiency,
effectiveness and needs for improved work principles and training
*     The means to quickly identify items costing above expectations
Road Network Classification Hierarchy
In Yemen, there is no formal system for road classification, except for paved roads, gravel roads
- 37 -



and tracks. Also, there are no legislative procedures that control the National importance of the
roads and to which authority responsibility lies for the implementation of maintenance.
Criteria for the selection of roads has been set as detailed below and a list of roads recommended
for declaration as National assets has been prepared.
*     Traffic volume
*     Geographic area and economic activity
*     Significant tourist and recreational generators
*     Road condition and standard
*     Road access between population areas and major towns and cities
*     Current responsible road authority
Management Information System
The Consultant reviewed the computer and system requirements of the YBRMF and
recommended the computer systems and accessories to be procured by the YBRMF to ensure
proper control and performance in the programming, planning and budgeting of the RMF.
The consultant also prepared specifications to enable the YBRMF to invite tenders for computer
systems to cover LAN, PMS, FMS, backup systems and Internet connections.
Financial Management System
The consultant reviewed the current system financial systems being used in the YBRMF and the
government and recommended the installation of an integrated computerized financial
management system for the use by the Fund. It was recommended that the system be introduced
in stages t meet the requirements of the fund and the capacity of the staff to be able to cope with
change to computerization.
Stage 1: Budget records and reports
General ledger and accounting records and reports
Financial management reporting
Stage 2: Payroll calculation and staff records
Stage 3: Stores and inventory
Revenue Collection for RMF
The law No 22 for 1995 defines RMF sources as following:
*     Road user charges
*     Fines imposed by law No.23 for 1994 regarding the weights and dimensions of vehicles
*     Loans and grants donate for road maintenance in accordance with applicable laws
*     All financial allocations stated in the bodies responsible for road maintenance
*     Any other resources allocated for the fund
- 38 -



However, currently, the RMF collects revenues for Road user Charges in the form of gasoline
levies, which is estimated to generate an annual return of YR700-750 million. The law no. 23 for
1994 for axle load control is not currently enforced; and, even if enforced, the effect would have
negligible impact on the amount of revenues to RMF.
There is a need for equity in the current road user charges and if diesel fuel tax is difficult to
impose or politically unacceptable, other methods of imposing a surcharge on commercial vehicles
must be considered. An alternative to such tax is the imposition of a Ton/km tax or heavy vehicle
license fees that equates to a ton/km tax.
Establishment of Road Maintenance Directorate
The passing of law No. 5 of 1998, establishing GCRB as Government contractor left the RMF
without Road Authority. MOCHUP assumed the role of GCRB as Road Authority and the
consultant was requested to prepare a detailed report to cover the requirement for the
establishment of Road M Maintenance Directorate within the MOCHUP. The consultant prepared
a detailed report including the staffing structure and responsibilities.
GCRB Support Program
Mechanical Engineering and equipment support was actioned by mobilizing the Mechamcal
Engineer and Equipment specialist to review the equipment operations of GCRB. The review
revealed that operations of GCRB required a much needed upgrade to improve efficiency in
allocation and stocking of spare parts, equipment utilization and the general running of their plant
mnd equipment operations.
Road Sector Review
The TOR for the Technical Assistance called consultant to develop a TOR for future works to
-nsure sustainability of the RMF.
During the WB mission of 13-20 July 1998, the consultant was requested to identify and prepare
'FOR for future Technical Assistance need in the Road Sector. A detailed report was prepared
detailing the finding of the review submitted to the RMF for consultation and approval by the
.IOCHUP.
The TOR to review the road sector would cover:
Current road sector arrangements
41    Options for road sector reform
Recommendations for road sector reforms
o     Prepare TOR for the establishment and institutional development of a Highway Authority
*     Prepare TOR for complementary institutional strengthening of other road sector
organizations

Compliance with Covenants
Financial Covenants
Since established in 1996, YBRMF auditor's reports covering the financial years ending up to
31st December 1998 have been submitted to the world Bank resident mission.
Other Covenants
Axle load control
Enforcement of law No. 23/1994
YBRMF under the law No.22/1995 has the responsibility to make sure that overloading fines are
collected and are used in an efficient and cost effective manner since overloading of vehicles
increases the cost of maintenance.
The YBRMF has taken the necessary steps to make sure that Law No. 23 for the year 1994
concerning the axle load control in the Rep. of Yemen is enforced. Such steps include the
following:
In April 15, 1999, YBRMF organized a high level workshop to address the importance of
preservation of the road network and the importance of limiting the detrimental effect of vehicle
overloading. The workshop was attended by high level government officials including the Prime
Minister.
A number of issues were discussed during the workshop and included several working papers
prepared by experts from concemed agencies such as the Traffic Department, Ministry of
Transport and the YBRMF. A number of recommendations have been issued and an awareness
campaign has been launched through the media to inform the public about various aspects of the
importance of preserving the National Highway as well as enforcing the law regarding vehicle
overloading.
The YBRMF has taken the initiative, together with the MOCHUP to operate the Weighbridges in
Hodiedah, Harad and Taiz. Operating expenses of those stations are being paid to GCRB out of
YBRMF budget.
The Weighbridges in Hodiedah, Harad and Taiz are now operational and opened 24 hours for
trucks to be weighted and to be informed about their obligations towards the law.
In order to further enforce Law No. 23 for the year 1994 regarding trucks overloading in the Rep.
of Yemen, YBRMF together with MOCHUP and the concemed ministries a number of steps have
been taken. Such steps include the procurement and installation of a number of portable weigh
pads in crossing points such as Harad and Sea Ports namely Aden, Hodiedah and Mukala Sea
- 40 -



'orts.
rhose measures are designed to make sure that overloaded trucks exiting those points are never
allowed to use the highway network and hence eliminating their damage to the road network.
[hose measures are also designed to eliminate time consuming work required by bridge operators
in highly trafficked weighbridges, like Hodiedah, as well as the need to unload excess weight off
Iruck which is considered an impossible task to carried out in such unequipped stations.
It I s therefore suggested that to reduce the effect of overloading the following measures must be
implemented:
. ,   Law No. 23/1994 be amended to include YBRMF representation on all monitoring
omnmittees.
*     Law No. 22/1995 be amended to delegate the responsibility of financing and operating
the weighbridges to YBRMF.
*     Monitoring committees become active to ensure that the requirement of law No.23/1994
are enforced.
*     Purchase several sets of portable weigh pads for use on roads and crossing points where
weigh stations do not exist.
*     Increase awareness among road users and general public on the detrimental effect of
c verloading.

Variation Order-Technical Assistance:
The RMF submitted to IDA mission to Yemen of March 7, 1999 a draft proposal to strengthen
the newly established Pavement Management System unit in order to extend its coverage to
include all paved roads in Yemen. The draft proposal included a short variation order to SMEC
consultancy, includes the establishment of a special management unit within the RMF, staffed with
trained personnel to be responsible for the data collection, entry and analysis. The staff cost for
this specialized unit and the other expenses shouldered for two years through the variation order,
after which the unit will be financed by the YBRMF through the administration budget.

designed to sustain the work of the PMS unit after it was set up and installed by the consultant.
Procurement of Portable Weigh pads
In its effort to control the excessive axle overloading, YBRMF was to procure, install and operate
11 portable weigh pads at various points of border crossings, ports and industrial facilities.
Several offers were received, evaluated and awarded to Jose Hanson, Germany. Due to
misinterpretation of commercial terms in the bidding document, the supplier declined to deliver
the weigh pads.
Training
Funds from TRP were made available to a number of RMF's staff to attend advance training
courses at the University of Birmingham, UK. The courses were very much related to the RMF's
activities and included topics such as Innovations in Road Management and Road Fund
Management and Financing.

CAMA Assessment Report
Transport Rehabilitation Project - Credit 2819
Introduction
The scope of operations, assets and organization of the present CAMA undergone radical changes first as a result of
unification (1990), then as a result of the Gulf cnses (1991) and finally due to the civil war (May-June, 1994) in which
considerable damage were suffered at Aden Intemational Airport (AIA) when many facilities at the airport were hit
including the international terminal, runway and the tower. Thus the losses suffered in the civil war have exacerbated
what was already a difficult situation.
1. Assessment of Project Objective, Design Implementation and Operational Experience
The project was designed to undertake high priority rehabilitation needs that include high economic rate of return
rehabilitation works stemmning from war damages at Aden Intemational Aurport. Priority has been given to those that
result in greatest reduction m economic losses and those, which affect safety.
1.1 Project Objectives and Components
1.1.1  Objective
The project aimed for the rehabilitation of the following areas:
a) Rehabilitation of Aden International Airport:
Reconstruction of Aden International Airport Terminal buildmg:
The AIA terminal, which was constructed m1986, was bombed during the civil war (May-June 1994). The damages
include about 15% of the civil works structures all of the services such as the electrical system, air-conditioning system,
baggage handling system, passenger information system etc. Detailed engineering of construction works was provided
for under the techncal assistance component of the TRP.
b) New control Tower and Technical building:
The old tower and techncal building housing the communication and navaids equipments also suffered considerable
damage during the civil war. Detailed design and bidding documents for the new tower and technical building
including emergency power generation have been prepared under French bilateral assistance, France has expressed its
willingness to finance the equipment and related training, provided the Government arranges for construction of the
tower and the technical building. The TRP financed the civil works, including all building service, so as to provide
complete buildings adequate to receive the equipment. When the French protocol did not materialize, the Government
and CAMA decided to include the communication and Navigational aids equipment as a non optional part of the main
contract in order to execute a complete operational package and to materialize the commitment for cofinancing, since a
firm commitment on financing of the equipment was a disbursement condition for thds part of the TRP.

1.1.3  Assessment
1.1.3.1 Although the project was significantly delayed, the objective has been largely achieved. Aden International
4irport is now fully rehabilitated and functional. Four rapid mtervention vehicles are operative in major
Yemeni airports including AIA. The quality of work is high and the performance in achieving the objective is
,atisfactory.
1.2 Achievement of Objectives and Outputs
1.2.1  Civil Works
1.2.1.1 ]'requalification of Contractors: The prequalification Document, prepared by CAMA, was based on the
S1tandard Prequalification Document of the World Bank to ensure that the bids will be extended only to those
bidders who have adequate capabilities and resources to perform successfully the specialized task of the
Rehabilitation of AIA and related facilities, but the document did not include the rehabilitation of the Runway
or the installation of the navaids equipment. The prequalification Documents were forwarded to IDA for "no
objection" on 07/08/97 and the relevant "no objection" was received on 12/08/97.
1.2.1.2 Irequalificafion Documents were received from 27 Main Contractors. These documents were evaluated in
accordance with the World Bank Guidelines and in terms of the contractors' capabilities to carry out the
r -quired works. Of them, 11 Main Contractors were adjudged as capable and a comprehensive
Irequalification Evaluation Report was sent to IDA on 10/12/97 to seek the necessary "no objection" that
was received on 18/12/97.
1.2.1.3 On 7/1/98, the bidding documents were distnbuted after IDA accorded the no objection to distribute the
bidding documents to the eligible and qualified bidders. The communication and Navaids were included in
t ke bidding documents as an option in order for CAMA to award them separately.
1.2.1.4 C AMA then decided to mclude the communication and Navaids equipment as non-optional part of the main
c)ntract in order to execute a complete operational package and to matenalize the commitment by the
g)vernment for cofinancing. Following the pre-bid meetng, which was held at Aden Int'l Airport on 24/2/98
and attended by the Consultant, CAMA and four interested bidders, Addendum No. 1 was issued. This
Addendum included all relevant "questions and answers", the commumcation and Navaids as non optional
p irt, points raised by IDA on the biddmg documents and matters discussed during the pre-bid meeting related
tc the expected works. IDA accorded its no objection to Addendum No.1 on 8/3/98, the same day the
Addendum was issued.
1.2.1.5 B .cause the condition of Aden Airport Runway 08-26 has deteriorated to such an extent that it could be
jeopardous to the safety of flights, the Govemment of Yemen requested IDA to assist m financing the
R habilitation of the Runway 08-26 from the current credit through a restructuring, and in March'98 during
the visit of IDA mission to Aden, the condition of the runway was discussed by the concerned parties; and a
M OU was signed on 24/3/98 accordingly.
1.2.1.6 D iring the preparation of the bidding documents, the Consultant (NACO) raised the issue of the shortfall in
th rehabilitation of AIA project and related facilities estimated cost. This was of great concern to the
gc vemment, CAMA and IDA. Major steps were taken to address this issue. During the visit of IDA mission
in March '98 discussions were held at top government level in order to resolve the shortfall of the project
budget and to mcorporate the rehabilitation of Aden Airport runway 08-26 m the bidding documents. It was
agreed that the Consultant (NACO) would be requested to submit a reasonable offer to carry out the
"iiLvestigation, study, design and supervision" of the works of AIA runway 08-26 and its drainage system that
mi ght be included in the bidding document as an addendum. (NACO) submitted an offer, but excluding the
supervision of the works, since the execution period will only be known after the study is finalized. The offer
of the Consultant (NACO) was discussed with the concerned authorities and agreed that it will form an
exi ension to the on-going consultants' contract. IDA was requested to accord the necessary "no objection" to
thi additional but essential component as Addendum No.2 which IDA accorded its "no objection" on
25.3/98.
-47 -



1.2.1 7 Following the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) prepared by IDA mission on 24 March 1998 that was
signed by the concemed parties, CAMA have had discussions with MOPD and MOHCUP regarding the
request for reallocation of funds within the Transport Rehab. Credit. It was finally agreed that XDR5.5M
would be requested by MOPD from the IDA Headquarters to be reallocated from Category 1(a) of the Credit
(Civil Works of Part A) to the Category lb and 2b (Civil Works and Consultant) of Part B of the Credit
Agreement. The reallocation request was submitted by MOPD on 9 August 1998, and a final Ammendment to
the Credit Agreement was made on November 7, 1999.
1.2.1.8 Addendum No.2 was issued after obtaining IDA's "no objection" on 25/03/98. The Addendum is related to
the specifications and bill of quantities for the rehabilitation of the runway 08-26.
1.2.1.9 Four main contractors: Dandar of Denmark, Saudi Binladin Group of Saudi Arabia, Italstade of Italy, and
CCC/Arab Contractors of Greece (joint venture), submitted their bids which were opened on 3 May, 1998.
1.2.1.10 With the assistance of the Consultant (NACO), the bids were evaluated by an evaluation committee that were
nominated by the Chairman of CAMA, the committee constituted engineers and experts from CAMA
headquarters, Aden Int'l Airport, and MOPD. The process of evaluation was completed over three weeks
period and the committee accomplished their assignment on 22ud May 1998, and the complete file was
submitted through the respective government channels to the Higher Tender Committee on 31 May, 1998.
1.2.1.11 On 13 July 1998 CAMA submitted the Bid Evaluation Report and recommendations to IDA through the Resident
Mission, Sana'a. IDA responded to the award recommendation on 21 Sept. 1998 copied to CAMA, stating that
IDA was not able to give a "no-objection" to the recommended award due to a disagreement with the evaluation
comnuittee on which was the lowest evaluated bidder. During the penod between September 21, 1998 and April
13, 1999, the award issues were conducted between High Tender Board, MOPD and IDA. On 13 April 1999, the
Government awarded the contract to Italstrade, and IDA on April 19, 1999 acknowledged receiving information
of the award without any objections. Italstrade in a letter dated April 30, 1999 declined to come for contract
negotiations. The government then proposed to award the contract to Saudi Binladin Group, and IDA accorded
"no objection" to this award on May 26, 1999. On May 27, 1999, CAMA sent the Letter of Acceptance to Saudi
Bmladm Group.
1.2.1.12 The contract was negotiated between SBG and CAMA experts from 28 to 31 May, and on 1st June '99 the
Contract was concluded and signed.
1.2.1.13 Following the signature of the Contract of the rehabilitation of AIA with Saudi binladen Group, the contractor
proposed to prepair the taxiway as a temporary runway by recerfacing the taxiway, removing any obsticales
on its sides and installing a temporary runway lights for normal operations in order to rehabilitate the runway
efficiently without causing hindrace to operations and without increase in the contract price. After the
acceptace of CAMA, the works for the taxiway preparation prceeded efficiently and the taxiway was handed
over to AIA as a temporary runway on 2/03/2000.
1.2.1.14 On 22nd May 2001, the contract was completed with a delay of 8 weeks. The delay was caused by custom
clearance formalities and problems faced in delayed shipments by the subcontractors. The 8 weeks delay for
hand-over was accepted by CAMA. Only minor snags were found at the time of preliminary hand-over, these
were completed during the one-year maintenance period including the flight calibration of the Navigational
Aids.
1.2.2 Equipment
1.2.2.1 Two parts of equipment was envisaged:
a) equipment related to Navigational Aids for AIA financed by the government, and
b)  equipment related to safety to Civil Aviation that were procured through IDA fmancing.
1.2.2.2 As stated in Para. 1.2.1.4 the communication and Navaids equipment for AIA were included as non-
optional part of the main contract in order to execute a complete operational package and to materialize
the commitment by the government for co-financing.
1.2.2.3 Dunng April '97, four Rapid Intervention vehicles were contracted from M/s Sides Fire & Rescue
Vehicle Industries of France for a total cost of FF11,453,356/- after obtaining IDA's reallocation Notice
-48 -



on 16/7/97 for XDR750,000/- from the Unallocated Category to Category 3b (Equipment). These
vehicles were procured following the Intemational Bidding Process (ICB). Proper evaluation of the Bids,
necessary "no objection" from IDA, and approval of the Yemem High Tender Board were obtained. The
relevant "no objection" was received on 03/4/97 while the approval of the Yemem High Tender Board
was on 9/4/97. The L/C for this procurement was opened through CBY and the necessary Special
Commitment request was forwarded to IDA on 12/7/97 for direct payment. This was accomplished
following a lengthy procedural course.
1.2 2.4 On 12 July 1998, the Preliminary Hand-over Certificate of the four (4) Rapid Intervention Vehicles was
issued to the Supplier.
1.2.2  Technical Assistance
a) Consultants Services for Design and SuDrvision of AIA Rehabilitation
Task Description
1   Study and Prelimmnary Design of AIA Passenger Terminal Building
2    Detailed Design and Bid Documents
3    Bidding and Contracting
4    Construction Supervision and Commissioning
5   Maintenance Period.
1.2. 3.1 During November '95, before the project became effective, mformation from IDA/World Bank Datacon
regarding consulting firms was obtained. 12 Consulting Finrns were selected and a Letter of Intent for
Consulting Services for the Rehabilitation of Aden Intemational Airport was forwarded to the respective
firns. Ten firns rephed of their mterest for the services required. Out of them six were selected and a
Letter of Invitation together with the prepared Terms of Reference (TOR) was sent to the interested
firms, after obtaining the IDA's "no objection" on July 30 1996.
1.2.:,.2 Following Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS), four firms: Dar Al-Handasah of Lebanon, NACO
of the Netherlands, CES of India, and Cansult of Canada, submitted their Technical and Financial
Proposals. The Technical Proposals were opened on 30/09/96 and were evaluated in terms of their
technical soundness, adequacy and quality of the services to be provided. The Technical Evaluation
Report was forwarded to IDA to seek "no objection" and after receipt of "no objection "on 1/1 1/96;
the financial envelopes were opened on 04/11/96 and evaluated. The complete file was forwarded to the
Higher Tender Board of the Government of Yemen for final award, and the Final Evaluation Report was
sent to IDA/World Bank Mission Office in Sana'a to seek the necessary "no objection".
1 2 3.3 Because the Higher Tender Board had a different view from that of CAMA on the successful bidder,
there was considerable delay in awarding the contract to NACO, for which IDA had accorded its "no
objection" on 0 1/04/97. On 8 June, 1997 the contract was signed with NACO for consulting services
related to the Rehabilitation of Aden International Airport which includes the Rehabilitation of the
Passenger Termmal building, the construction of the Control Tower and Technical Building, the Power
Station, the mstallation of the Communication and Navigational Aids and all related facilities. The
Contract amounts to Dfl.2054845/- plus YR. 16764000/-. Smce then the consultant has been actively
engaged in providing the services according to the agreed work plan.
1.2.3 4 The work plan of the services of the consultant NACO includes the design for the rehabilitation of the
passenger terminal buildmg and its mechanical and electrical facilities, review of the design and Biddmg
documents, that were prepared by "Sofreavia"; a French consultant, related to the control tower,
technical building, power station, comnmunication and navigational aids equipment, assistance in
evaluation of bids, and finally supervision of the related works.
1.2.3.5 It was decided iutially that the civil works would be given to two separate contractors, one for the ready
design and bidding documents for the control tower and the technical building, that require only review
by NACO, and the other for the rehabilitation of the passenger terminal building, the design of which
would be completed in seven months. Meanwhile, the procurement of communication and navaids
equipment and their installation would be contracted separately since cofinancing did not materialize and
they will be financed by the Government.
- 49 -



1.2.3.6 CAMA and IDA then agreed to join all related civil works including electrical and mechanical installations
in one contract and prequalify the contractors accordingly. The prequalification Document was prepared by
CAMA and forwarded to IDA on 07/08/97 and the necessary "no objection" from IDA was obtained on
12/08/97.
b) CAMA Policy and Strategy Study
1.2.3.7 This component was imtially delayed due to the possibility of the contracting process of AIA rehabilitation
being declared miss-procured, in which case IDA would withdraw it's financing. However, CAMA has
moved forward towards more commercial approach and carried out an internal policy and institutional
assessment and it was found out that the funds available under the TRP were insufficient to carry out the
required study. CAMA is expecting that the Arab Funds Sana'a Airport Credit will take up such study.
Moreover CAMA is receiving assistance from the EU under the umbrella of the World Bank
Administrative Reform Project.
1.2.4  Sustainability
1.2.4.1 Seven-Fire Fighting personnel were trained at the premises of the manufacturer M/s Sides of France, as
part of the Contract of the Four Rapid Intervention Vehicles in the use and maintenance of the vehicles.
1.2.4.2 Training also was arranged for five CAMA engineers at the Hague, the Netherlands, m project
management and runway design. Additionally, four engineers were also trained at site during the
Supervision of the Works of AIA by the Consultant (NACO).
1.2.4.3 The conmmunication and navaids package that was forming part of the main contract of AIA
rehabilitation, also mcluded overseas and OJT training. Three CAMA engineers were traind in Germany
in maintenance of navigational aids as well as ten AIA engineers received OJT traming.
1.2.4.4 CAMA has an autonomous management structure, the personnel of AIA have long lasting experience in
airport management and the airport is operating normally, the authority is attempting to generate
increased and sustained revenue sources in a rather difficult investment climate, particularly after the
events of 1 It September.
2. Evaluation of Borrowers own Performance
2.1    The simplified formula adapted by CAMA for the rehabilitation of AIA, in which the civil works contractor
subcontracted the equipment, supervised by a consultant project manager, with a relatively limited PMU
requirements and expenses at CAMA, led to an efficient implementation of the project.
2.2     CAMA was able to successfully supervise the rehabilitation and the improvements of Aden International
Airport with its own resources apart from considerable procurement delays that were expenenced beyond
CAMA's control.
3. Evaluation of Performance of Bank
3.1 The Bank staff showed full flexibility and understanding to CAMA's needs. The requirement of the rehabilitation
of the runway is one of many examples. The Bank staff also shared and paid attention to CAMA's approach,
especially at the early stages of the project. This had considerable effect in the success of the project.
4. Recommendations for Future Operations.
4.1 During the life cycle of the project, it was often noticed that there is no clear mechanism for following -up the
World Bank guidelines by the respective authonties, which led to undue delays especially to those related to
extensive formalities involved in processing the invoices for payments. As an example, at the time of writing thus
report, the contractor's final payment, both from IDA and the Government was not released yet.
