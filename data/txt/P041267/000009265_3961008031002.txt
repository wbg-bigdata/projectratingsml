REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower      Republic of Yemen (ROY)
Beneficiaries   Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning (MOC), and
Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority (CAMA)
Amount         SDR24.7 million (US$37.0 million equivalent)
Terms          Standard with 40-year maturity and 10 years grace
Commitment:  0.5 percent on undisbursed credit balances, beginning 60 days after signing, less any
Fees          waiver
Project     : The project's primary objective is to undertake urgent rehabilitation needs in the
Description    roads and civil aviation sectors; it also seeks to improve the capacity for road
maintenance, and to develop appropriate civil aviation policy. The proposed project
would rehabilitate two badly deteriorated road sections, and reconstruct the terminal
building and construct a new control tower at the Aden International Airport (AIA)
which were damaged during the war. The road sector component (Part-A) of the
project includes: rehabilitation of the Hodeidah-Salif (65 Iam) road leading to the
deepwater port at Salif, and the Am Ayn-Naqabah (100 Iam) section of the Aden -
Mukalla road; establishment of a Road Maintenance Fund (RMF), and through a newly
established Yemen Road Fund Board (YRFB), introduction of systematic maintenance
planning and budgeting for the main road network. The civil aviation component (Part-
B) of the project includes: reconstruction and replacement of all services (air
conditioning, passenger information systems, etc.) of the AIA terminal which suffered
bomb damage during the war in 1994; construction of a control tower; and a Civil
Aviation Policy Study to identify options for developing the institutions in the civil
aviation sector.
Benefits    : The project benefits include: restoration of the Aden International Airport, thereby
contributing to safety and to re-establishing Aden as a center for trade and commerce;
reducing vehicle operating costs on the road sections rehabilitated, for which the
economic rate of return is estimated to be about 40 percent; and securing the
maintenance of the main road network through creation of an assured source of funding
based on road user charges, and of the necessary institutional capacity for effective
maintenance. The project also improves the macro-economic situation by reducing the
burden on the general budget imposed by road maintenance which will be funded
through user charges.
Risks       : Since the project is for emergency reconstruction, its design has been kept simple in
order to minimize implementation delays. A majority of the procurement is effected
through four large ICB contracts. Potential delays in the implementation of the Road
Maintenance Fund is addressed by making enactment of legislation to establish the



ii
Fund and the Yemen Road Fund Board a condition of Board presentation. Delays in
obtaining financing for the AIA control tower equipment is addressed by making
confirmation of this financing by December 31, 1996 a requirement in the Credit
Agreement.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1   The proposed Transport Rehabilitation Project in the Republic of Yemen (ROY), is designed to
address needs in the country's transport sector arising both out of the damages suffered in the recent civil war
(May-June, 1994), and from neglect of road maintenance which now necessitates reconstruction of sections
of the road network. War related emergency reconstruction works to be financed under the project are,
reconstruction of the terminal building and replacement of the control tower at the Aden International Airport,
which were badly damaged in the fighting; the terminal building took a direct hit and has not been in use
since the war. Road rehabilitation works to be financed under the project include two road sections: a 100-
km section of the Shukra-Am Ayn-Naqaba road between Aden and Mukalla which is the main link to the
eastern parts of the country; and the Hodeidah-Salif Road which links the new deepwater port of Salif on the
Red Sea coast to the main road network and to the city of Hodeidah.
1.2   Since the road rehabilitation works to be financed under the Credit have been necessitated by
inadequate maintenance performance in the road sector, the project includes components to assist the
Government in strengthening the road maintenance function in the country. To this end, the project will
assist in the establishment of a Road Maintenance Fund with revenues generated from road user charges, and
in putting in place a maintenance planning, budgeting and contracting capability which, in conjunction with
an assured source of funding, would remove the primary obstacles to effective maintenance of the road
network.
A.    Country Background
1.3   The Republic of Yemen occupies an area of about 530,000 sq. km. of largely mountainous and
desertic terrain in the southwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Of a total population of about 16 million
(1995), about 12 million are concentrated in the northern governorates which cover less than a third of the
land area. There are five distinct geographic regions: the coastal plain along the Red Sea (the Tihama Plain);
the Indian Ocean desertic littoral, with its strategic centers of population such as Aden; the rugged central
and southern highlands, rising to about 2500 m., where the bulk of the population lives; the eastern plateau;
and the Rub Al Khali desert. Only about 3 percent of the land is arable, mainly in the central and southern
highlands where rainfall is highest, in the Tihama plain, and in the wadis (river valleys) of the eastern
plateau.
1.4   Though the overall output of the Yemeni economy has improved recently, the country still faces a
difficult situation. Following a slump in economic activity after the Gulf War, GDP rebounded in 1992.
Growth accelerated in 1993 and 1994, averaging 5.8 percent, primarily due to rapidly expanding oil
production, which increased by 19 and 56 percent in 1993 and 1994. This growth however did not benefit
all segments of the population; unemployment which had averaged 25-30 percent during 1990-93 is estimated
to have risen further in 1994. With a population of about 14 million, per capita GNP is estimated at US$280,
or well below the IDA eligibility cut-off. The country's economic difficulties stem from both internal and
external factors. Internally, unification caused substantial increases in Government expenditures which could
not be covered by non-inflationary means, and also weakened the Government's ability to implement policies



2
to deal with a deteriorating macro-economic situation. Externally, the Gulf crisis led to a drop in financial
inflows - both aid and private remittances, and to a large increase in the labor force, due to the return of
Yemeni workers from Gulf countries. The civil war in 1994 only worsened an already difficult situation.
1.5   The Government's preoccupation with the unification process and the hiatus caused by the hostilities
in 1994, overshadowed efforts to halt the deterioration in public finances. The budget deficit remained very
large, at over 18 percent of GDP in 1992 and 1993, and increased to an estimated 21.5 percent in 1994. The
deficit has customarily been financed through external borrowing and through domestic bank financing.
External financing has declined and now amounts to only 1.5 percent of GDP, and in the absence of a well
developed market for treasury instruments, deficit financing was largely in the form of money creation. As
a result, the parallel market exchange rate for the Yemeni Rial (YR) rapidly depreciated; by March 1995,
while the official rate was YR12/$, it was trading at YR142/$ on the parallel market. Following devaluation
of the official rate to YR50/$ in April 1995, the parallel market rate depreciated a bit further to YR150/$.
1.6   IDA's Country Assistance Strategy for Yemen, being presented to the Board along with this project,
has the following main objectives: (i) support stabilization, structural reforms and social protection measures;
(ii) improve portfolio implementation and the sustainability of past and future investments; and (iii) promote
sustainable natural and human resources development. This project supports and is fully consistent with the
proposed IDA assistance strategy: it would restore key economic infrastructure while improving the
sustainability of transport sector investments by funding maintenance through a system of user charges. It
would also promote macro-economic stabilization by reducing the burden on the Government's budget of
financing road maintenance, the costs of which will now be recovered from road users.
B.    IDA Sector Role and Strategy
1.7   Since 1970, IDA has contributed to the development of ROY's transport system and institutions
through one port and seven highway projects in the former YAR; and an engineering credit, one port and
six highway projects in the former PDRY. In addition, the Multi-Mode Transport Project (Credit 2177-
YEM) which was approved in 1990 after the creation of the unified ROY supported construction of roads,
and technical assistance and equipment for the aviation and ports sectors. The first seven highway projects
in the north (Credits 315-YAR, 558-YAR, 794-YAR, 1267-YAR, 1413-YAR, 1726-YAR and 1848-YAR),
and the engineering credit and the first seven highway projects in the south (Credits 512-YDR, 240-YDR,
560-YDR, 1144-YDR, 1295-YDR, 1617-YDR and 1823-YDR) have been completed.
1.8   Previous IDA highway projects in the north and south, assisted in the establishment and consolidation
of highway agencies. Two public sector construction units were also established to implement road works
due to a lack of domestic capacity in the road construction sector. A Vocational Training Ceniter was also
established under the Third Highway Project in Taiz, as a training facility for all road maintenance staff. In
addition, IDA credits assisted in the preparation of a Highway Master Plan (February 1986), and a Transport
Sector Study (June 1984) which have helped define investment and institutional needs.
1.9   The two completed port projects, have also achieved important physical targets, and the PCR/PPAR
No. 5465 for the port project in the north (Credit 714-YAR) found that the project was instrumental in
expanding port capacity significantly. Similarly, the PCR/PPAR No. 5982 for the Aden Port Rehabilitation
Project in the south (Credit 584-YDR) acknowledges that the project helped to cope with an unforeseen
increase in port traffic in the late 1970's and early 1980's; however, changes in shipping patterns following
the closure of the Suez Canal, and later, competition from other Red Sea ports caused Aden to lose much of
its business in bunkering and ship services. Manpower training in the ports and civil aviation sectors are
being addressed under the ongoing Multi-Mode Transport Project (Credit 2177-YEM).



3
1.10   Since Yemen's primary road network is approaching completion, IDA's transport sector strategy
focusses on: maintenance of existing assets (as in the present project); selective expansion of the road network
providing access to areas with high economic potential; and the upgrading of operational and financial
management. A study now being initiated under a Project Preparation Facility seeks to prioritize maintenance
and rehabilitation needs of the existing road network, and the present project addresses some of the more
pressing institutional and financial needs affecting maintenance of the road network.(')
1.11   The experience with project implementation in Yemen has been mixed, but since the civil war the
remaining project in the sector (Multi-mode Transport project) has been performing well. The monthly
progress of physical works is acceptable, the project is disbursing well, no extension of the closing date seems
necessary at this stage, and there are no problems with the Special Account and Audit Reporting. This is
mainly due to simplicity in project design and straightforward procurement arrangements. The present project
has therefore been designed accordingly with most of the procurement to be accomplished through four large
civil works contracts. Credit covenants have also been designed so that implementation of otherwise
independent project components is not disrupted by defaults on covenants relating to other components.
II. SECTORAL BACKGROUND
2.1    Yemen's transport sector, like most other parts of the economy, is presently comprised of a mix of
the systems which existed in the former PDRY and YAR prior to unification. In the south, the sector was
dominated by centralized planning and public enterprises, while in the north, more traditional forms of
organization have been the norm, with numerous anachronistic practices and distortions. Since unification
the country as a whole has been moving toward more liberalized, market economy based forms of
organization, and this is true in the transport sector also.
A.    The Road Sector
2.2    Over the decade 1980-90, the paved road network in Yemen grew rapidly from about 2,900 kms. to
4,900 kms, and in early 1993, the length of the paved network, including projects under construction stood
at 5,734 luns. Average daily traffic volumes range from around 10,000 ADT (near Sana'a) to just under
1,000 ADT on most of the network, with traffic volumes in the north generally exceeding 2,000 ADT, while
in the south most roads carry less than 2,000 ADT with a few exceptions near Aden and in the Hadramout
valley. Since unification of the country in 1990, traffic growth rates have been around 8 percent per annum,
reflecting increases in the vehicle fleet resulting from the large numbers of vehicles brought into the country
by the returnees after the Gulf crisis, and also increases in trade and transport among various parts of the
newly unified country. Rapid expansion of the road network, which essentially, doubled in the last 15 years,
has caused maintenance of existing roads to be neglected, and deteriorating roads now cause large economic
losses through increased vehicle operating costs, as well as for reconstruction of roads which have
deteriorated to the point of structural failure. Rehabilitation and maintenance of the road network has,
therefore, become an urgent priority in the sector.
2.3    Key issues in the sector include inadequate funding of road maintenance, low cost recovery,
overloading of trucks and high axle loads, and institutional weaknesses in planning. The issues and
As part of the assistance strategy, IDA has also prepared and negotiated the Safir-Hadramout Road
Project supporting a 300 km expansion of the road network to provide better communications between
north-Yemen and the former south (Hadramout). The project is pending confirmation of cofinancing. The
road component of the Transport Rehabilitation Project includes various institutional and transport policy
changes which were agreed during negotiations of the Safir-Hadramout Road Project.

recommnended policy actions are described in Annex 1 and are summarized in Table 2.1 below. In order to
improve cost recovery and maintenance funding, a Road Maintenance Fund is proposed to be set up financed
by a road user surcharge on fuel, and other user charges such as heavy vehicle license fees (see Annex 2).
Administration of the RMF will be by the newly established Yemen Road Fund Board which will be
responsible for planning and administering road maintenance expenditures, and legislation for the
establishment of the RMF and YRFB has been developed and has been reviewed by IDA. Terms of Reference
for technical assistance to be provided to the YRFB for putting in place appropriate planning and control
systems have been developed and were agreed at negotiations. A Letter of Road Sector Strategy and Policy
setting out the Government's policy in the sector has also been provided to IDA (Annex 3).

B.      Civil Aviation
2.4     As in the case of the roads sector, the civil aviation sector comprises a mix of systems that existed,
prior to unification of the country, in the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) of the former PDRY, and in the
Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority (CAMA) of the former YAR. The scope of operations, assets
and organization of the present CAMA, which absorbed CAD at unification, have undergone radical changes
first as a result of unification (1990), more recently due to the Gulf crisis (1991), and finally due to the civil
war (May-June, 1994) in which considerable damage was suffered at the Aden International Airport.
2.5     Following unification in 1990, CAMA became responsible for the combined airspace of the unified
country, and given the vast geographical extent of the former PDRY, this was a considerable expansion in
the airspace controlled by CAMA. It also absorbed a large number of staff of the former CAD whose policy
had been to carry out most works using its own staff, whereas CAMA relied to a far greater extent on
contracting. CAMA also acquired from CAD a completely different mix of equipment, mnuch of it supplied
from eastern bloc sources, which caused difficulties in obtaining spares, inter-operability and maintenance.
The Gulf crisis in 1991 precipitated another major change; up until then Saudi Arabia had been supporting
all air traffic services in the northern Governorates, and controlling the upper airspace from Jeddah. When
relations with Saudi Arabia deteriorated during the Gulf crisis, the Saudis withdrew support, and the entire



S
responsibility, and financial burden, of managing the airspace fell on CAMA. The most recent crisis, further
strained CAMA due to the large losses of equipment and facilities suffered at AIA which had become the
primary base for air traffic services following the withdrawal of Saudi assistance. These events have resulted
in a considerably weakened sector significantly compromising civil aviation safety in the country. The Civil
Aviation National Plan-2005 (CANP-2005), prepared by international consultants under European Union
assistance in 1992 (prior to the most recent crisis), had identified numerous critical deficiencies in the sector,
and the losses suffered in the civil war have now exacerbated what was already a difficult situation. CANP-
2005 undertook an extensive assessment of past air traffic trends and prospects for the future, for the 5
international and 14 domestic airports in the country. Table 2.2 below summarizes the traffic estimates
presented in CANP-2005, with the exception of the data for 1993 and 1994 which were provided by CAMA.
Forecasts made in CANP-2005 expect the relative shares of the major airports to remain relatively stable,
with Aden registering a slightly higher growth rate and doubling its passenger traffic to almost 500,000
passengers by the year 2005. Whereas over the next ten years, passenger traffic in the country as a whole
is projected to grow at between 4 and 5 percent per annum, Aden's traffic is projected to grow at between
5 and 6 percent per annum.

2.6    CAMA is an autonomous agency, under the Minister of Transport. Its ten-member Board of
Directors includes senior managers of CAMA, one representative each from the Ministry of Transport and
the Air Force, and the Chairman of the national airline. The Chairman of CAMA also has executive
responsibility for running CAMA. The Board functions largely as a management committee rather than a
body which exercises oversight over management. CAMA's present organization structure, financial
condition and operations are described in greater detail in Annex 4. Key issues facing CAMA are discussed
briefly below, and a more detailed discussion is in the Annex.
2.7   The most critical issues facing CAMA at present are a lack of trained manpower and their extremely
weak financial situation. The organization expects to lose many senior staff in the next five years when the
staff occupying senior positions retire. Low civil service salaries makes it difficult to recruit and retain
qualified personnel. An experienced CAMA technician earns a third to one half the salary of a similarly
qualified technician working for the national airline, which has a special arrangement allowing much higher
salary scales. CAMA also loses trained technicians to the oil companies working in Yemen, who have a need
for trained electronics technicians. CAMA's two training institutes at Sana'a and Aden, once considered a



6
possible regional training site are now barely functional. CAMA's financial condition is precarious, and
presently its revenues barely suffice to pay for salaries and the agency is dependent on Government subsidies
to cover a bare minimum of operating expenses. It is dependent on donor/Government funding for all its
development expenditures, and even items such as spare parts and paint for marking runways often need to
be funded by donors. The reasons for CAMA's weak financial condition include:
(a)    Low tariffs - a revision of CAMA's tariffs is now under consideration, however, even with
the tariff increase CAMA revenues will recover only two thirds of its expenditures (see Annex 4);
(b)    Overstaffing primarily due to the absorption of large numbers of CAD staff;
(c)    Non-payment or delayed payment by the national carriers who now owe CAMA the
equivalent of a year's worth of CAMA revenues; and
(d)    Loss of significant overflight revenues due to inadequacies in billing and financial systems.
CAMA's income statements for FY93, FY94, and estimates/projections for the years 1995, 2000, 2005 are
in Annex 4. Projections are made for two scenarios - retaining present tariffs and with the increased tariff
now under consideration - and show that even with the increased tariff, CAMA continues to make losses.
2.8   In view of the present incomplete understanding of the constraints and options the civil aviation sector
faces from an institutional development standpoint, it is advisable that, as a first step, an institutional
development strategy and policy study be undertaken and TORs for such a study have been agreed with IDA.
The study would review the current situation, identify options and recommend a course of action with regard
to a number of policy areas such as the role of the private sector, organizational structure, tariff setting and
financing, responsibility for negotiating bilateral air transport agreements, staffing and training, remuneration,
etc., all of which crucially impact on the ability to deliver safe and cost-effective air transport services,
without burdening the government with having to finance large deficits in CAMA's budget. The principles
which would guide the development of Civil Aviation policy have been discussed and are set out in a Letter
of Civil Aviation Policy from the Government to IDA (Annex 5).
III. THE PROJECT
3.1   In selecting the components of the proposed Transport Rehabilitation Project, Government has given
priority to those which result in the greatest reduction in economic losses, i.e., road rehabilitation and
terminal reconstruction at AIA, and to those which affect safety, e.g., the control tower and communications
and navigation equipment for AIA.
A.    Project Objectives
3.2    The project's primary objective is to rehabilitate critical components of the country's road and civil
aviation infrastructure; secondarily, the project seeks to improve institutional capacity in these sectors for
planning and maintenance of existing assets.
B.    Project Description
3.3    As the project involves two separate implementing agencies it has been sub-divided in two parts, one
for each agency, each to be implemented independently of the other. The following summarizes the main
components and a more detailed description is provided in Annex 6.



7
3.4   Part A: Ministry of Construction. Housing & Urban Plng. (MOC) would implement the following:
(1)   Hodeidah-Salif, 65 km Road Rehabilitation (US$10.3 million)(2).
(2)    Am Ayn-Naqabah, 100 km Road Rehabilitation (US$10.0 million).
(3)    Equipment, Software and Training for Maintenance Planning (US$2.0 million).
(4)    Assistance to the newly created Yemen Road Fund Board (US$0.74 million).
(5)    Study for Planning & Prioritizing Road Maintenance Needs and Detailed Design for
Rehabilitation of key highway links (US$1.5 million).
(6)   Implementation and Construction Supervision Consultants (US$1.5 million).
A Project Implementation Unit, supported by supervision consultants, would be established within the
Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning to oversee Part-A of the project. This Project
Implementation Unit will also oversee the establishment and initial operation of the Road Maintenance Fund
and the Yemen Road Fund Board.
3.5   Part B: Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority (CAMA) would implement the following:
(1)    Aden International Airport Terminal Reconstruction (US$7.0 million).
(2)    New Control Tower and Technical Building at AIA (US$6.0 million).
(3)   Communications/Navaids Equipment (US$5.0 million).
(4)    Safety Equipment (US$1.0 million).
(5)    Civil Aviation Strategy and Policy Study (US$0.5 million).
(6)   Implementation, Design and Construction Supervision (US$1.5 million).
A Project Implementation Unit, supported by the designed and construction supervision consultants, would
be established at CAMA headquarters in Sana'a to oversee all components under Part B of the project.
C.    Cost Estimate
3.6   The project cost estimate is prr sented in Table 3.1, and is based on the following:
(a)    The quantities of the road pavement layers are defined by the length and width of the road
and are not subject to inaccuracies. The payments to the contractor are based on theoretical
quantities, and since the pavement cost in road rehabilitation contracts is almost 50 percent or more
of the total cost of the project, a phvsical contingencv of only 5 percent is considered adequate.
2/  These are total base costs including the Goverment's contribution.



8
(b)    Since the reconstruction costs of the AIA terminal is based on a cost estimate (prepared by
the consultants who did the original design) without detailed engineering, a higher physical
contingency of 10 percent has been assumed for the ALA civil works.
(c)    For estimating the price contingency, a three-year implementation for road works and a two-
year implementation for airport civil works, has been assumed.
A price escalation of 2.4 percent per year were discussed and agreed during project preparation.

D.    Financing Plan
3.7   The Ministry of Planning indicated that a GOY contribution of US$3.0 million for the Aden
International Airport component was feasible using the general development budget over a three-year
period. This would amount to 20 percent of the civil works costs. For the Road Component the
Government would provide another US$6.8 million over the two to three year implementation period
for the road works. IDA contribution would be limited to an amount in US$ equivalent to 70
percent of the costs of the road rehabilitation projects. The Ministry of Planning indicated that the
Government of France has expressed interest in financing US$5.0 million equivalent for the
Communications and Navaids Equipment and confirmation of this or another source of financing for
this equipment is to be provided by December 31, 1996. An IDA Credit of US$37.00 million
equivalent would complete the financing needed as shown in Table 3.2.

E.    Project Implementation
3.8   Independent Project Implemen;tion Units, at MOC and CAMA, will oversee implementation of Part-
A and Part-B of the project, respectively. The civil works under Part-A would be carried out under two
separate contracts, one for each of the two roads. The bidding for the road works will take place as soon
as the supervision consultant, who would be responsible for supervising both contracts, has been appointed.
For Part-B, the bidding documents for the control tower and the technical buildings are ready and would be
bid as a package in one contract as soon as the design and supervision consultant has been appointed and has
reviewed the bid documents. The appointed firm will also be assigned the design work and supervision for
reconstruction of the terminal building, and as soon as the documents are ready, the terminal building
reconstruction work can be bid, about 4 months after the first contract for construction of the control tower
has been awarded. An implementation and procurement plan for the project is in Annex 6.

3.9    Design and Bidding Documents.   Detailed design of the road projects has been completed and
bidding documents have been completed by international consultants. The design is, however, based on
relatively old data on the state of road deterioration on the two roads. For this reason and in order to reduce
costs, the supervision consultant would have to review the design and update it before construction works
start. The bidding documents will also be adjusted to comply with the Bank's guidelines for procurement
of works, with minor deviations/adjustments as follows:
(a)    The contract would be denominated in US$ or another currency widely used in international
trade, and for the road contracts the Government would pay 30 percent of the contract price in local
currency using the market rate of exchange 28 days prior to bid opening, foreign contractors may
choose to be paid in a currency other than the US$ at a fixed rate of exchange to the US$.
(b)    The road contracts would provide for price adjustment for bitumen, steel and cement using
international price indices for these materials. For fuel, the price adjustment would be based on
actual price adjustments by the Government in the prices of fuel in Yemen.
(b)    The price adjustment formula would not include changes in the costs of international inputs;
however, since most equipment costs would be incurred at an early stage in the contract, and the
contracts are denominated in US$, international escalation would be relatively predictable, and the
lack of escalation for international labor and equipment would not represent an unmanageable risk
to contractors.
3.10   Detailed design and bidding documents for the construction of the technical building and control tower
for the Aden International Airport have recently been prepared by an international consultant. The documents
assume the contract would be denominated in US$, with 20 percent of the contract price payable in Yemeni
Rials at the market rate of exchange, and include price adjustment provisions for all materials and local labor.
The Government has agreed that minor adjustments would be made to the documents by the supervision
consultant before tendering to make them fully conform with the Bank's guidelines for procurement of works.
3.11   The reconstruction works needed for the terminal building have been surveyed by the international
consulting firm which prepared the original design, and a detailed cost estimate has been prepared. This
includes rehabilitation of the terminal building, replacement of all fittings such as doors and windows, all
partitioning, false ceilings, insulations, air-conditioning, electrical equipment, restaurants, furnishings, and
repair of roof and replacements of facade elements. Similarly, replacement of all of the special equipment
such as check-in counters with scales, conveyor belt on the departure side, telephone system, flight
information display, public address system, etc. has been costed. The design and tender documents have not
been prepared yet, and this would be undertaken by the same supervision consultant engaged for the control
tower/technical building who would also supervise the terminal rehabilitation. The bidding of this consultancy
will be undertaken shortly, and shortlisting of consultants is now in progress.
F.    Procurement
3.12   The project components, their estimated costs, and the procurement arrangements for the elements
to be financed by IDA are summarized in Table 3.3. IDA would finance the civil works, procurement of
safety equipment, design reviews and construction supervision, and other technical assistance elements of the
project. The IDA-financed civil works and equipment would be procured under the Guidelines for
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits. Consulting services financed under the Credit, would be
procured in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the
Bank as Executing Agency.



11
3.13   All civil works contracts would be awarded using ICB procedures, and procurement documentation
and decisions relating to all civil works contracts would be subject to prior review and approval by IDA.
Pre-qualification of contractors would be carried out for all civil works contracts of the project. Contracts
for equipment and materials, not exceeding US$200,000 each, would be procured through international
shopping procedures based on the comparison of three price quotations from at least two countries. The total
aggregate value of such contracts would not exceed US$1.0 million. All contracts exceeding US$200,000
would be subject to prior review and approval by IDA. For consultancy assignments financed by IDA under
the project, there would be prior review for contracts worth $100,000 and above for contracts with consulting
firms and $50,000 and above in the case of contracts with individual consultants. This would result in prior
review of about 90 percent of IDA-financed procurement. During Credit negotiations, agreement would be
reached with the Government on the above procurement arrangements and those set out in Table 3.3.

G.    Disbursements and Audit
3.14   The proposed IDA Credit would be disbursed against the project components as shown in Table 3.4.
Withdrawal applications for contracts valued at more than US$200,000 would be fully documented and
presented in English for disbursements. Disbursement for contracts valued at US$200,000 or less would be
made on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs). Agreement has been reached with the Government
that documentation to support expenditures financed under SOEs or otherwise will be maintained, in English,
by MOC and CAMA. and made available for review by IDA supervision missions, and annual audit reports
of Project Accounts and SOEs will be prepared and submitted in English. by auditors acceptable to IDA
within six months of the end of each fiscal year.



12
3.15   Special Accounts. To facilitate disbursements on smaller contracts, a portion of IDA's share of the
project could be disbursed through two Special Accounts which would be opened at the Central Bank of
Yemen by MOC & CAMA, respectively. In the past, utilization of Special Accounts has been extremely low,
and the substantial funds tied up in Special Accounts has been a source of concern. Therefore, the authorized
allocation for each Special Account would be US$0.5 million, equivalent to about four months of project
expenses, other than for the main civil works contracts, financed under the IDA Credit. Replenishment of
the Special Accounts would follow IDA procedures. The Special Accounts would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The audit report, in English, would be submitted to IDA for review
and approval within six months of the end of each fiscal year. During negotiations, agreement would be
reached on the operation and auditing of the Special Accounts.

3.17   Disbursement Schedule. A schedule of disbursements, based on a projected effectiveness date in
June 1996, is given in Annex 7. It is anticipated that the proposed project will be completed in about 66
months, including a 12 months contractor's maintenance period, from the date of approval by IDA or by
December 31, 2001, and the Closing Date is set for June 30, 2002. Due to the relatively uncomplicated
nature of the works to be financed, the estimated disbursement schedule is shorter than the standard
disbursement profile for transport sector projects.

H.    Project Supervision and Monitoring
3.18   Supervision requirements for the project are shown in Table 3.5. Over the project execution period
this would amount to 12 missions, with one large project inception mission initially, to launch the project.
Project supervision would be based on an agreed set of Project Monitoring and Development Impact
indicators which are presented in Annex 8. The new Resident Mission in Yemen is expected to play an
important role in supervising the project, and about a third of overall supervision inputs will be provided by
staff stationed in the field, who will follow up procurement and implementation progress and assist the
Government in conforming with IDA guidelines and procedures.

I.    Environmental Aspects
3.19   Since the project involves only rehabilitation and maintenance of: (i) existing roads in their original
alignments without significant widening; and (ii) reconstruction of the AIA terminal and replacement of the
control tower, no significant environmental impacts are anticipated. The project is, therefore, rated as an
environmental category - B investment. The Environmental Analysis including a table of proposed mitigation
plans are in Annex 9.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
4.1    This section presents the economic evaluation of the road rehabilitation components (US$28.52
million) of the project. The two road sections to be rehabilitated, Hodeidah-Salif (65 kms) and the Am Ayn-
Naqabah Road (100 Iam) are in extremely poor condition and require reconstruction over a large portion of
their lengths and strengthening (overlays) of the remainder. Sections of the first road have failed so badly
that vehicles can average only 25 to 30 kmph, as compared with normal highway speeds of 80 to 90
kmnph. For the economic evaluation, tbfr Hodeidah-Salif section was divided into two segments: (a) a 7 km
segment that requires strengthening with minor widening and (b) a 58 km segment that requires
reconstruction. Similarly, the Am Ayn-Naqabah section was also divided into two segments: (a) a 40 km
segment that requires reconstruction and (b) a 60 km segment which requires an overlay (strengthening). The
results for each segment were combined to form the economic evaluation of each section and for the overall
project. The details of these evaluations are presented in Annex 10.
4.2    Reconstruction of the bomb damaged terminal building at Aden International Airport (US$8.03
million) has not been subjected to an economic evaluation since this is an unavoidable expenditure for repair
of war damage, and the benefits of this expenditure are expected to be high as it will restore the use of this
expensive terminal facility. Construction of the control tower for the airport (US$6.89 million) is also



14
necessary because the old (and inadequate) tower was damaged in the war and much of the equipment was
lost; a condition for bilateral financing of the equipment is that the Government provide the necessary
buildings and civil structures, and by providing these the project enables the airport to acquire the equipment
needed to restore the safety and efficiency of air traffic control operations. Since it is difficult to quantify
the benefits of constructing the new tower, no economic evaluation has been carried out for this component.
Also, the terminal building works consists of the reconstruction of an existing structure while the control
tower works are dictated by minimum safety standards both of which allow little flexibility in adjusting the
scope of the project. The economic evaluation presented below, therefore pertains to the road rehabilitation
components only.
A.    Evaluation Methodology for the Road Component
4.3    The Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model (HDM-III) developed by the World Bank
was utilized to evaluate the road components of the project. HDM simulates the behavior of a road pavement
under given traffic loads, maintenance strategies and rehabilitation options. It also assesses the costs of
operating various classes of vehicles over the road as the condition of the pavement changes. By evaluating
the road's condition and vehicle operating costs with and without the proposed rehabilitation measures, it is
able to assess the benefits of the rehabilitation. Key elements of such an exercise are assessments of traffic
volumes, existing and projected, for various classes of vehicles, modelling vehicle operating costs and
modelling road deterioration.
4.4    Traffic Projections. Table 1 of Annex 10 presents traffic projections for the two road sections for
a period of 20 years. Traffic growth rates estimated for the 100 km Am Ayn-Naqabah section is 6 percent
annually, and the section now carries 1200 vehicles per day on average. The projected growth rate is based
on observed growth rates for traffic on other sections of the Aden - Mukalla road. On the Hodeidah-Salif
road, traffic is expected to grow at a high rate owing to the construction of the new deepwater port at Salif,
and the growth rate on this section is projected at 8 percent per annum for the first 10 years, and at 5 percent
subsequently; presently the road carries about 660 vehicles per day on average.
4.5    Vehicle Operating Costs. For the with project and without project cases, vehicle operating costs
(per vehicle-kl) were computed, using the HDM-III model, for five classes of vehicles as a function of the
road geometry, vehicle characteristics and the yearly roughness estimated using HDM-III (see Annex 10,
Table 3). These unit vehicle operating costs were used to compute the benefits derived from rehabilitation
of the road.
4.6    Road Deterioration. For each road segment, the yearly road deterioration (roughness) with the
project and without the project was estimated using HDM-III as a function of the estimated traffic, loading,
environment and construction characteristics (see Annex 10, Tables 4A, 4B, 4C and 4D). The HDM-III
model was also used to define the optimal maintenance strategy (operation and timing) after the completion
of construction, e.g., an overlay in yeir 2009.
4.7    Both construction costs and vehicle operating costs were converted to economic costs by eliminating
taxes, duties and subsidies. The distortion due to the difference between the official and parallel market
exchange rates was eliminated by expressing the unit vehicle operating costs in dollar terms, and by also
computing the project costs (construction and future maintenance) in dollars terms (see Annex 10, Table 2).



15
4.8    Benefits. The benefits were obtained by multiplying the traffic by the vehicle operating cost savings,
and comparing the with and without the project cases. It should be noted that no passenger time saving
benefits were counted and therefore the benefits estimates are conservative. Annex 10, Tables 4A to 4D
present the calculation of benefits for each segment, and Table 5A presents the calculation of benefits for each
section, i.e., consolidates the regment evaluations to give the overall evaluation of the road section.
B.    Econonmic Evaluation and Sensitivity Analysis
4.9    The economic evaluation and the sensitivity analysis is shown in Annex 10, Tables 5A to 5D. and
the results are summarized in Table 4.1 below. The expected rate of return for the project is 39.5 percent,
and the sensitivity analysis shows that even with a combined 20 percent increase in costs and a 20 percent
decrease in benefits the economic rate of return for the rehabilitation works is estimated to be 28.8 percent.

4.10   In addition, a switching value analysis was carried out on key parameters: the cost of construction
and the level of traffic. As may be expected for a project with high rates of return, the switching values,
where the NPV turns negative, were found to be high. In the case of construction costs, it was found that
costs would need to increase by a factor of 3.2 to 4.5 (differs by road section) before the project exhibits
negative NPV at a 12 percent discount r-te. Similarly, traffic volumes would need to reduce to between 0.23
to 0.35 of projected levels before the NPV turned negative.
C.    Project Risks
4.11   Since the project is for emergency reconstruction, its design has been kept simple in order to
minimize implementation delays. A majority of the procurement is effected through four large ICB contracts.
Potential delays in the implementation of the Road Maintenance Fund is addressed by making Cabinet
approval of legislation to establish the Fund and the Yemen Road Fund Board a condition of Board
presentation. Potential delays in obtaining financing for the AIA control tower equipment is a risk, and if
financing for this is not confirmed by France by December 31, 1996, the Government has agreed to seek



16
alternative sources of grant financing or to provide the funds needed from its own resources. Since the type
of equipment required can be financed through a number of supplier credits, the risk of delay on this account
is relatively small.
V. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1    At negotiations, agreement was reached on the following:
(a)    Prior to disbursements for any civil works under Part-A of the project, GOY will appoint the
Supervision consultants for the road components of the project (para. 3.8).
(b)    Prior to disbursements for civil works and equipment under Part-B of the project, GOY will take
following actions:
(i)    Select and appoint the Design and Supervision consultants for the reconstruction of the
terminal and construction of the control tower at Aden International Airport (para. 3.8); and
(ii)   Implement tariff increase proposed by CAMA (para. 2.7).
(c)    During implementation of the project, GOY will ensure that:
(i)    The three weigh-bridges at Hodeidah, Mokha and Harad will be put into operation, and axle
load controls will be implemented at each location in a manner satisfactory to IDA by
December 31, 1996 (para. 2.3 and Annex 1);
(ii)   All revenue from road user charges, including fuel surcharge initially set at YR 0.5/litre on
petrol, will be collected and deposited in a Road Maintenance Fund (para. 2.3 and Annex 2);
(iii)   The program of actions set out in the Letter of Road Sector Development Policies and
Actions (para. 2.3 and Annex 3) and the Letter of Civil Aviation Policy (para. 2.8 and Annex
5) will be carried out;
(iv)   Financing of at least US$5.0 million equivalent for control tower equipment at Aden
International Airport would be made available by December 31, 1996 (para. 3.7); and
(v)    Consultants to support the Yemen Road Fund Board and to carry out the Study for Planning
and Prioritizing Road Maintenance Needs (paras.2.3 and 3.4) will be appointed by December
31, 1996.
Based on the above agreements, the proposed project would provide a suitable basis for an IDA Credit to the
Republic of Yemen of SDR24.7 million (US$37.0 million equivalent) with a 40-year maturity including a 10-
year grace period, and a service charge of 0.75 of one percent on the outstanding amount.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
The Road Sector
1.    Over the decade 1980-90, the paved road network in Yemen grew rapidly from about 2,900 kms to
4,900 kms, and in early 1993, the length of the paved network, including projects under construction stood
at 5,734 kms. Average daily traffic volumes range from around 10,000 ADT (near Sana'a) to just under
1,000 ADT on most of the network, with traffic volumes in the north generally exceeding 2,000 ADT, while
in the south most roads carry less than 2,000 ADT with a few exceptions near Aden and in the Hadramout
valley. Since unification of the country in 1990, traffic growth rates have been around 8 percent per annum,
reflecting the increases in the vehicle fleet resulting from the large numbers of vehicles brought into the
country by the returnees after the Gulf crisis, and also the increases in trade and transport among various
parts of the newly unified country. Rapid expansion of the road network, which essentially, doubled in the
last 15 years, has caused maintenance of existing roads to be neglected, and deteriorating roads now cause
large economic losses through increased vehicle operating costs, as well as for reconstruction of roads which
have deteriorated to the point of structural failure. Rehabilitation and maintenance of the road network has,
therefore, become an urgent priority in the sector.
A.    Performance of Road Transport
2.    Available data indicates that road freight transport is growing rapidly since unification of the country
in 1990, with total goods vehicle-km increasing from 5.2 billion in 1991 to over 5.6 billion in 1992. In
passenger transport the picture is mixed - passenger car vehicle-km increased from 4.4 billion in 1991 to 4.7
billion in 1992, but the output of buses, which are operated by the state-owned General Transport
Corporation, has grown only moderately from about 69 million vehicle-km in 1991 to 72 million vehicle-km
in 1992. The growth rates implied by these figures for goods movements and for passenger cars are large
(in the range of 8 to 9% per annum); the former relates to unification of the country and the consequent
increases in transport demand due to trade between the northern and southern governorates, while the latter
appears to be the effect of the returnees from the Gulf countries bringing with them large numbers of
personal vehicles.
3.    Average daily traffic (ADT) volumes range from around 10,000 ADT (near Sana'a) to just under
1,000 ADT on most of the paved road network, with traffic volumes in the north generally exceeding 2,000
ADT, while in the south most roads carry less than 2,000 ADT with a few exceptions near Aden and in the
Hadramout Valley. In 1992, the vehicle fleet is believed to have consisted of about 186,000 cars, 2,500
buses, and 252,000 goods vehicles. Vehicle utilization rates appear to be low particularly for trucks and
buses, and the average annual distance travelled is considerably below full utilization rates: for trucks
average annual distance driven is abou* 22,000 km which is about a fourth of full utilization, and for buses
it is 28,000 km which is about half the full utilization rate.
B.    Public Expenditure in the Road Sector
4.    Over the decade 1980-90, the road network in Yemen grew rapidly from about 2,900 kms to 4,900
kms, and in early 1993 the length of the paved road network, including projects under construction, stood
at 5,734 kms. Major construction and rehabilitation projects in the FY93/94 program included a number
of projects to improve connections between the north and south, such as the proposed Safir-Hadramout road
project, the Harib - Marib road and others. This rapid expansion of the network has caused public
expenditures in the sector to become heavily concentrated on construction of new roads, and maintenance
expenditures have come under increasing pressure. The road sector budgets for 1991, 1992 and 1993 (see

Table 1) show the emphasis placed on new construction versus maintenance. During the last three years
around 80% of the total expenditures (YR 3347 million) have been used for construction of new roads, while
only 8.4% (YR 280 million) have been used for rehabilitation and strengthening of paved roads, and 10.7 %
(YR 358 million) have been used for ordinary maintenance. When converted to constant 1991 prices,
maintenance expenditures show a declining trend. Of the total maintenance allocation, about 65 % is spent
on routine maintenance (mainly salary costs), 20 % on periodic maintenance (re-graveling, resealing of paved
roads), and 15% for road safety and emergencies.

5.     Even these low allocations for maintenance are being used mostly for routine maintenance, and very
little periodic maintenance is undertaken. Paved roads are thus allowed to deteriorate until strengthening
by thick asphalt concrete (AC) overlays or reconstruction is called for. As a result about one third of the
paved road network is rated as being in poor or worse condition, and only half the paved network is rated
"good" or better (see Table 2). The condition of the network imposes very significant costs both due to
increased vehicle operating costs, and due to the need for expensive reconstruction of large sections of the
network. Past neglect of maintenance has created an immediate need to both increase funding of normal
(routine and periodic) maintenance as well as to undertake a stabilization program over the next five to six
years to restore the network to a maintainable condition. It is estimated that maintenance expenditures need
to be increased to between YR 1600 million and YR 1700 million per annum in order to adequately provide
for timely routine and periodic maintenance, and for stabilization of the existing network (see Annex 2 for
details on the stabilization program).

Financing Road Maintenance
6.     Such a considerable increase in maintenance and rehabilitation expenditures, out of the Government's
overall budgetary resources, is especially difficult at present in view of the severe fiscal constraints facing the
Government. Nor is such an increase in funding of the road sector from general revenues desirable, since road
users who will be the beneficiaries of improved maintenance should, on efficiency grounds, be required to pay
for the cost of maintaining road infrastructure. Presently, it is estimated that total resources mobilized in the
road sector (in 1992) from fees, taxes and duties on sector inputs is on the order of YR 1462 million which
is about equal to the total outlays of about YR 1.6 billion. However, much of the revenue sources in the sector
are really contributors to general revenues, eg. import duties on vehicle and spares (63% of road sector
revenues) and should not therefore be considered road user charges. Fuel taxes contribute another 18 percent,
annual vehicle fees, license fees, etc. provide the remaining 20 percent.
7.    Only vehicle license and registration fees can properly be considered road user charges, and these
presently total only YR 300 million. Annual road tax on trucks at YR 350 per ton of capacity and on buses
of YR 50 per seat are clearly not recovering from heavy vehicles the extra cost of infrastructure provision that
they impose. These figures indicate that direct cost recovery from road users is exceedingly low, and increases
in road maintenance financing should simultaneously put in place mechanisms to improve cost recovery in the
sector.
Road User Charges
8.    Previous IDA Credits, 1848-YAR and 1823-YDR, required that road user charges be reviewed, and
the former agreement also called for a review of petroleum pricing. While road user charges have been revised
from time to time, cost recovery in the road sector has not kept pace with road expenditures largely due to the
difficulty of raising significant amounts of resources through instruments such as vehicle license and registration
fees. The problems associated with these instruments has prompted the Government to consider mobilizing
resources for the sector through a surcharge on fuel sales, which is an instrument that has been used
successfully in a number of countries. A road user surcharge (RUS) imposed on fuel sales has a number of
advantages: (a) it is directly related to the extent of road use; (b) the burden is spread over a period of time
and each payment is relatively small thereby avoiding the difficulties associated with collection of large
payments such as an annual road tax; and (c) it does not have any perverse effects such as the safety problems
associated with instruments such as a surcharge on tyres.



Annex 1
Page 4 of 9                                                                                   20
9.    It is expected that based on present fuel consumption levels, the RUS would need to be set at about
YR 1.0 per liter which is about 2 percent of the price of gasoline (YR 50/lt). It should be noted that fuel
prices in Yemen are extremely low (in relation to border prices), and future price increases to bring fuel prices
in line with international prices will reduce the proportionate impact of the RUS on fuel prices. This will hold
true even though the absolute level of the RUS may need to be revised upwards to compensate for declines in
consumption caused by increases in fuel prices.
10.   In discussions with the Ministries of Planning and Finance, recent difficulties encountered in increasing
diesel prices, to which the agricultural sector is particularly sensitive, were highlighted. While the concept of
a fuel surcharge was accepted in principle, it was felt that political considerations would require that the initial
RUS on fuel should be restricted to petrol only, and a surcharge on diesel could be introduced at a later stage.
Since this would exclude heavy vehicles, which are also responsible for most of the road damage, an increase
in heavy vehicle fees would be used in combination with the surcharge on petrol. Further, to ensure that the
legislation does not exclude introduction of a surcharge on diesel in the future, the legislation would exclude
a diesel surcharge in the initial years, but provide for its introduction in the future by specifying the initial
surcharge as YR 0.5/liter for petrol and YR 0.0/liter for diesel.
Road Maintenance Fund
11.   To ensure that improved cost recovery in the road sector does in fact lead to improvements in the
condition of roads, road maintenance budgets need to be protected in relation to new construction budgets
which have been consuming a disproportionate share of expenditures in the sector. Further, unless increases
in road user charges are directly linked to increases in road maintenance expenditures, and a consequent
improvement in the condition of the network, road users would be unwilling to pay the additional charges.
Therefore, Government intends to establish a Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) into which road user charges
collected through vehicle registration and license fees, and the RUS on fuel sales would be deposited.
12.   Based on the YR 0.5/liter RUS on petrol, at present consumption levels, and an increase in heavy
vehicle license fees (for recommended schedule of heavy vehicle fees see Alternative 2, in Table 8 of Annex
2), and remittance of existing vehicle registration and license fees to the RMF, it is expected that the RMF
would receive about YR 1200 million in its initial year of operation. While this is somewhat below the
estimated YR 3200 million needed for the first year of the road network stabilization program, the domestic
road maintenance and rehabilitation capacity available will probably not be able to absorb more than the YR
1200 million likely to be available in the initial years. With respect to foreign exchange needs, MOF indicated
that no allocations of foreign exchange were likely to be available to the RMF, and all inputs would have to
be procured in the local market. Once established and functioning, the RMF could be augmented by
development assistance to finance the foreign exchange component of the stabilization program, and the
legislation establishing the RMF allows for external debt financing of road rehabilitation/reconstruction works.
13.   A technical memorandum (Annex 2) on the establishment of a Road Maintenance Fund financed
through a Road User Surcharge on fuel sales and other road user fees has been prepared in consultation with
the Ministries of Finance, Planning and Construction.  The memorandum  also describes institutional
arrangements for the management of road maintenance programs and expenditures by creating a new
autonomous institution (the Yemen Road Fund Board, paras. 20 and 21) to manage the preservation of the road
network. This would provide the private sector contractors with the opportunity to provide road maintenance
services such as road pavement strengthening and road rehabilitation. Based on this memorandum, Ministry
of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning has prepared a draft law to establish the Road Maintenance Fund
and authorize Road User Surcharges on fuel sales. The draft law incorporates some additional features. In
addition to the surcharge on fuel sales, it authorizes the remittance of vehicle registration and annual license
fees, collected by the Customs Department, and truck overloading penalties, to be collected by the Ministry
of Finance, into the Road Maintenance Fund on a monthly basis.

C.    Institutional Framework
14.   The Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning (MOC) has overall responsibility for
construction and maintenance of all roads in Yemen, except feeder roads (Ministry of Agriculture) and earth
tracks which are maintained by the Ministry of Local Administration. The General Corporation for Roads and
Bridges (GCRB) is organized as an autonomous entity, under MOC, to implement construction and maintenance
activities. GCRB was established after reunification by merging the road administrations of North- and South-
Yemen. However, the Public Corporation for Road Construction (PCRC), which employs most of the staff
of the former road authority in the South, has not yet been merged but discussions on this are underway. The
Ministry is also responsible for the administration of government tenders, which is carried out by a High
Tender Board for all Government procurement above YR 50 million, and for all foreign assisted procurement.
The organization structure of MOC and GCRB for the road sector is shown in Chart I attached.
15.   MOC has about 750 employees, and GCRB has in addition about 3,200 employees, of which more than
2,000 employees work on new construction projects. GCRB staff are part of the civil service, but allowed
more competitive remuneration for skilled technical personnel. For instance, engineers are paid about 40-50
percent more than civil service engineers. Though GCRB depends on the government's budget for the
contracts which fund all its activities, no salaries or overhead costs are funded directly by the Government,
thereby seeking to ensure that GCRB operates like a corporate entity. However, there is little evidence of
financial autonomy; payments to contractors and consultants are made by the Ministry of Finance, and about
50 different signatures are needed for a single payment to be approved. Despite these difficulties, a major
achievement of GCRB has been its effective use of private contractors and consultants while maintaining a force
account capability.
Road Maintenance Organization
16.   The road network under MOC's authority consists of about 5,000 km of paved roads and about 10,000
km of other roads (of which about 2,000 km are gravel roads that receive regular maintenance by GCRB).
Maintenance of paved and gravel roads is undertaken by the Directorate General of Maintenance located within
GCRB. The General Manager for Maintenance is in charge of an organization of about 750 permanent staff
and on average 200-250 laborers on daily wages. The organization contains 9 regular Maintenance Divisions
each headed by a Director. The decentralized divisions are responsible for one or more governorates, and are
located at district centers. Maintenance teams within each division are responsible for geographical sections
of the road network. There are also specialized groups at headquarters level for road safety, traffic survey and
road sign/marking works.
17.    The organizational structure for maintenance appears fragmented with a large number of units
reporting directly to the General Manager with apparently little delegation or decentralization. The department,
while employing around a third of GCRB staff, is only managing 3 percent of the road budget or about US$1.5
million. This amounts to about US$300 per km of paved road. Further, more than half of the funds are used
for salaries, and a large part of the materials and equipment procured are for gravel roads (re-graveling of
about 150 km a year and gravel shoulder repair), and as a result little funds are actually spent on routine and
periodic maintenance of paved roads. Consequently, very little regular maintenance activity is observable on
the paved road network.

Use of Domestic Contractors
18.   GCRB executes road construction by a combination of force account (40%), local contractors (30%),
and international contractors (30%). About half of locally funded road construction works are carried out by
private contractors. Donor funded road projects are in general carried out by private contractors, though in
a few special cases GCRB has been executing the works by force account in agreement with the respective
donors. All new bridge works are carried out by contractors. GCRB also uses smaller local contractors as
sub-contractors in force account works, and about 5 of the 40 percent force account works is carried out by
small domestic contractors, mainly for drainage and smaller concrete works. GCRB uses consultants to
undertake feasibility studies, design, and construction supervision with the only exception that GCRB supervises
itself on force account works that are 100 percent locally financed. Most of the consultants are international
firms. This balanced use of contractors and consultants in construction works is an institutional strength of
GCRB.
Institutional Development Concerns
19.   Despite the many strengths of the Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning and GCRB,
there are a number of problems that need to be addressed.
* GCRB has expressed interest in bidding on IDA-financed projects as an independent contractor.
However, the present close linkage between GCRB and the Ministry, and the lack of financial
autonomy, reduces market discipline to which GCRB operations are subject, and therefore makes
it inappropriate at present for GCRB to bid in competition with the private sector.
* The costs of GCRB's force account operations are distorted by a number of factors which cause
comparisons between GCRB and private contractors to be biased in favor of GCRB. Deficiencies
in costing include, rates for equipment not adequately reflecting replacement costs, and foreign
exchange costs being valued at a much lower official exchange rate. For GCRB to be fully
commercialized, the cost accounting system would have to be reconfigured to allow full cost
accounting and pricing of the works carried out by GCRB.
* There is a tendency to adhere to existing road construction practices, partly due to a lack of
financial inputs to decision-making, but also due to a lack of assessment of institutional
performance. An example is GCRB's reluctance to use double bituminous surface treatment as the
wearing course on low traffic volume roads, although it may be cheaper. Most developed
countries cannot afford such a policy. There are also examples of premature cracking and rutting
on newly constructed pavements, without investigations being initiated to learn from possible
mistakes.
Institutional Restructuring
20.   An option which addresses many of the above problems would be the establishment of a fully
autonomous road agency, with independent funding from road user charges, which is responsible for
preservation of the highway system (see also discussion of Road Maintenance Fund, Annex 2). Such an
agency, referred to here as the Yemen Road Fund Board (YRFB) would not execute any works itself but would
contract for maintenance and rehabilitation works with private contractors and public sector contractors such
as GCRB. The Government would not involve itself in day-to-day management, but would appoint a
commercially oriented Board of Directors with representation also from road users and the road contracting
industry. The YRFB's primary responsibilities would be:
(a)    development of multi-year maintenance and rehabilitation programs and the approval of an
annual program of works;



Annex 1
23                                                                                Page 7of 9
(b)    managing the Road Maintenance Fund and recommending appropriate changes in road user
charges based on properly established funding needs;
(c)    monitoring the condition of the road network; and
(d)    controlling the maintenance and rehabilitation works carried out by private contractors and by
GCRB.
The YRFB would be set up so that public sector contractors are required to compete with each other and with
the private sector, and all payments made would be on the basis of actual works accomplished. By retaining
a commercially oriented construction capability within GCRB, the YRFB would also deter collusion for
contracting services, and retain a capacity to respond to emergencies.
21.   The advantages of such an institutional arrangement are: (a) competitive contracting of all road works
including those carried out by GCRB; (b) GCRB operations can be commercialized; (c) increased motivation
and efficiency of staff through better training and salaries that are competitive with those paid by the private
sector in Yemen; (d) a clearer relationship between road user charges, the quality of roads, and accountability
for road maintenance; and (e) reduced demand on the Government's budget by eliminating present allocations
for road maintenance which would then be entirely financed through road user charges. Implementation of
such changes requires a high level of commitment, and considerable efforts to train staff, and to put in place
new institutional mechanisms and processes, and MOC and the Ministries of Finance and Planning have
expressed their strong support for such an institutional restructuring. Technical assistance to be provided under
the project includes a component to develop new institutional structures and operational procedures for the
Yemen Road Fund Board. The TOR also includes support to commercialize GCRB's operations and develop
the local contracting industry.
D.    Road Transport
22.   Since unification of the country in 1990, a number of anomalies have developed in the road transport
sector owing to incompatibilities between policies in the North and the South prior to unification, and these
have compounded the previous distortions in the sector. In a number of areas such as tariff regulation,
transport industry organization, etc., policies in the North and South sometimes work at cross-purposes, and
create strong distortions and inefficiencies.  Compliance with existing covenants under the various Credit
Agreements entered into with the former YAR and PDRY Governments has also been affected by the changes
following unification.
23.   According to an axle load survey conducted in 1987, there is a very significant axle load problem in
the North. The survey found average rear single axle loads of 20 tons, and average rear tandem axle loads
of 33 tons, while proposed axle load controls would limit these to 13 and 21 tons, respectively. These average
axle loads appear to be high, and are probably due to the surveys being conducted on loaded direction lanes
and near main traffic generating centers such as Hodeidah Port. Nevertheless, it is widely agreed that high
axle loads are a common problem.
24.   Under Credit 2177-YEM it was agreed that GOY would provide the Association, by March 31, 1992,
an analysis of truck overloading, and would implement, by June 30, 1992, a program for enforcing axle load
limits. An analysis of axle loads has been provided to the appraisal mission, and legislation to revise and unify
existing axle load controls of the former YAR and PDRY Governments, together with a Prime Ministerial
Decree on implementing arrangements has been enacted. The legislation limits axle loads to 13 tons for single
axles and 21 tons for tandem axles. Previous credits have also financed the installation of truck weighing
stations at Hodeidah, Mokha and Harad, and these weigh stations have remained unutilized since 1988.
Enforcement of axle load controls need not present any administrative difficulties, since the Ferzah operators

could be instructed to allocate cargo in accordance with the rated capacity of various truck types, thereby
reducing the need for stopping and weighing of loaded trucks and the discharging of excess cargo.  Such
measures will however require that present controls on freight tariffs be removed to allow truck operators to
make a profit on the reduced payloads.
Policy Actions
25.    Table 3 summarizes the issues and actions discussed above on which agreement was reached in the
form of a letter of sector strategy and policy. The Letter of Road Sector Strategy & Policy, discussed and
agreed at negotiation, is attached as Annex 3. During the project, technical assistance to be provided under
agreed Terms of Reference would assist Government in implementing actions set out in the Letter of Road
Sector Strategy and Policy.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
Road Maintenance Fund
I. INTRODUCTION
1.     Road maintenance is a high priority, with economic returns often above 25% or even much higher.
Any rational public expenditure program should therefore give road maintenance a high priority on a
continuing basis. Due to a difficult budget situation it has not been possible to allocate sufficient funds for
routine and periodic road maintenance in Yemen, in spite of the well documented economic benefits of
maintenance operations. This has resulted in a considerable backlog of deferred road maintenance, a problem
which now has to be addressed by much more costly rehabilitation and reconstruction. The recent need to
use IDA credit funds for rehabilitation studies of more than 700 km of existing roads, badly in need of
recurrent and periodic maintenance, and possibly beyond economic repair by the time the studies are finished
and financing arranged, is an example of the effects of the current problem.
II. ROAD CONDITIONS
2.     The quality of a road can be measured in quantitative terms by 'roughness' measures such as the
International Roughness Index (IRI). If not maintained, paved roads deteriorate very rapidly after a certain
stage in their life cycle. The deterioration of unmaintained paved roads follow a typical non-linear path as
shown in Figure 1(') .

During a long initial phase which lasts up to two-thirds of the life cycle, paved roads undergo little visible
deterioration. This stage is followed by a phase of increasing deterioration; first slowly, but then rapidly
accelerating into 'fair condition', which ends within a few years in radical structural failure ('poor condition').
For the unwary, this characteristic of paved roads tends to disguise future maintenance requirements of young
road networks. During the first phase, maintenance needs are minimal, and a paved road can be kept in good
condition by fairly inexpensive routine maintenance. In the subsequent phase of increasing deterioration (into
fair condition), the pavement can be restored to good condition. This can be done by patching and resealing,
or by strengthening the pavement with an overlay. The latter, which is a moderately costly measure, restores
the road's structural strength and riding quality so as to meet traffic requirements for the next several years,
thus starting a new pavement cycle.  With appropriate routine maintenance and timely resealing or
strengthening, a paved road should be kept from deteriorating into poor condition, which requires far more
costly reconstruction. Unfortunately, a large part of the paved road network in Yemen has now entered the
critical life-cycle stage in Figure 1.
Vehicle Operating Costs
3.     Broadly speaking, the total costs of road transport are made up of vehicle operating costs and the
investment and maintenance costs related to provision of road services. Except where traffic is very light,
the vehicle operating costs constitute the major part of total road transport costs. This has important
implications for road management and maintenance. As vehicle operating costs are closely related to road
condition as measured by the 'roughness', the development of road user costs on a paved road will follow
the same non-linear path as in Figure 1. Hence, the costs to the road users increase progressively when the
road is allowed to develop into the critical life-cycle stage. As Vehicle Operating Costs (VOC) constitute such
a large part of total road transport costs, even a small percentage increase in the VOC from rougher roads
is significant, outweighing the cost savings from deferred maintenance. Continued under-financing of mainte-
nance may thus lead to many times its costs in higher vehicle operating costs as well as higher rehabilitation
costs.
Ill. REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
4.     Table 1 provides an overview of the actual maintenance requirements as estimated by MOC compared
to the Government budget allocations for 1994. As can be seen from Table 1, current budget allocations fall
substantially short of actual requirements for a full maintenance program. Total costs of a full maintenance
program are estimated to YR 1286 million/year whereas the overall budget allocation is only YR 347 million
for 1994. Hence, the shortfall is ca. YR 940 million, or about 73%. Routine maintenance of the main roads
will cost YR 106 million per year(2), which may be compared with the present budget allocation of YR 23
million. The need for recurrent maintenance (patching of potholes on paved roads and reshaping of roadway
and ditches on unpaved roads) is estimated to be YR 250 million per year, compared with a budget allocation
of YR 49 million for 1994.
5.     The cost estimates for periodic maintenance are based on the assumption that resurfacing of the total
network is required every fourth year. This may overstate the actual need for resealing which is normally
carried out at intervals of 6-8 years. Hence, the total costs of YR 352.5 million/year for resealing appear to
(2)    This covers the 4,300 km of paved and 1000 km of gravel roads which currently are the responsibilty of GCRB.

be on the high side(3). Based on a six-year standard the total cost of periodic maintenance would amount to
YR 258 million/year, which may be compared with a current budget allocation of YR 75.5 million for 1994.
6.     As shown in Section 2, a large part of the paved roads network is in critical need of
strengthening/overlaying or more comprehensive rehabilitation. Some 187 km of paved roads have been
subject to strengthening or rehabilitation since 1991. There are plans, ongoing works and committed financial
resources available for rehabilitation of another 251 km at a total cost of YR 693 million(4) in 1994, including
the separate budget allocation of YR 200 million provided by the Government for strengthening/overlaying
(see Table 1). In Table 1 a separate allowance of YR 298.5 million was suggested for simple maintenance
of the ruralfeeder roads, just to keep them open. However, no allocation has been made for this in 1994.
Clearly, some resources will also have to be used for emergency repairs or very rudimentary maintenance
of the rural feeder roads, just to assure their passabillity.
Requirements to clear the backlog and preserve the existing paved roads
7.     It is difficult to assess how much resources will be available for rehabilitation and strengthening of
the paved roads in the coming years. Existing plans prepared by the Planning Department in GCRB show
that emphasis is put on new construction rather than rehabilitation and strengthening of existing roads.
According to the current plan, some YR 10 billion can be expected to be used for new construction during
the five-year period 1994-1998, while YR 1.4 billion may be used for rehabilitation and strengthening of the
existing roads('). This will only allow for strengthening of about 160 km of paved road every year, and the
entire network every 27 years(6). This is substantially less than actual requirements to clear the backlog for
urgent rehabilitation works and preserve remaining roads in good condition. At the prevailing traffic levels,
axle loads, maintenance and design standards, one would expect that overlaying of paved roads would nor-
mally be required every 10-12 years. GCRB's own estimates indicate that in order to clear the backlog and
preserve the existing paved roads it would be necessary to carry out rehabilitation of approximately 900 km
and strengthening of another 1000 km during the next 5 years. This is considerably more than the 800 km
allowed for in the existing plans which are based on the recognition that government budgets will be very
tight also in the coming years.
8.     Stabilization of the existing paved roads within a 5 years period would consequently require
rehabilitation and strengthening of an average of 380 km/year during the next 5 years. As GCRB is presently
involved in rehabilitation of the paved roads and has previously carried out overlaying until 1989, and since
the necessary equipment will soon be available for these operations, it is conceivable that GCRB could carry
out a substantial part of the required rehabilitation and strengthening if adequate resources are provided(').
A stabilization program may thus be formulated as shown in Table 2.
(3)    In practice this wiU of course depend on a number of factors, including the number and thickness of layers, climate
conditions, the costs of resealing relative to vehicle operating costs etc., and may differfrom case to case. In
general, however, it seems like most countries rely on less frequent resealing than every 4th year, and the
economics of longer intervals tend to be reconfirmed by simulations with transport economic models.

(local and foreign financing) for ongoing rehabilitation projects from previous years.
(5)    Calculated in constant 1993 prices.
(6)    This is based on GCRBs cost estimate for overlaying carried out by force account.

') Te distribution of works between GCRB and contractors for 1994 is not known.
9.     It should be emphasized that this plan is only an example. The cost estimates may be uncertain, and
the distribution of works between GCRB and contractors may be different. However, Table 2 demonstrates
that considerable resources will have to be allocated to such a program if the existing paved roads network
shall be preserved in good condition. It is assumed that rehabilitation and strengthening of altogether 251
km of the paved roads at a total cost of YR 693 million will be carried out according to the existing plans
in 1994. Altogether the total costs of such a stabilization program would be close to YR 4 billion, or about
YR 780 million/year measured in constant 1993 prices. Due to the substantial financial requirement, the
question may arise as to whether the stabilization program can be carried out over a longer time span, thus
reducing the annual costs during the first years. This would have to be considered carefully, as delaying the
program may substantially increase the costs of rehabilitation and the need for full reconstruction of road
sections.
Funding requirements for a stabilization program and preventive maintenance
10.    Table 3 shows total funding requirements for the stabilization program in Table 2, and preventive
maintenance for the years 1994 - 1998. Annual maintenance costs are based on MOC's estimates in Table
1, except for the periodic maintenance of paved roads where it has been assumed that resealing every 6th year
will be sufficient.  Hence, total funding requirements for preventive maintenance, rehabilitation and
stabilization of the principal road network can be estimated to approximately YR 1,300 - 1,500 million/year
in 1993 prices. Allowing also for the most basic maintenance of the rural feeder roads, total financial
requirements increase to YR 1,600 - 1,800 million/year.

IV. ROAD SECTOR CASH FLOWS
11.   The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the actual financial situation in the road
sector, and to prepare a basis for analyzing possible solutions to the financing problem described in Section
3. Hence, this section looks into the resource availability, financial constraints and current priorities in the
road sector. It also examines existing taxation of road users and their contribution to cover the real economic
costs of the road services, and the extent to which there is a potential for increasing road user charges to
finance rehabilitation and maintenance.
Revenues from the road sector
12.    Table 4 shows the public revenues from the road sector for 1991 and 1992 and a preliminary estimate
for 1993. As can be seen from Table 4, import duties on vehicles and spare parts generally account for some
60% of total road sector revenues. In 1992, total import duties on vehicles and spares amounted to about
YR 924 million.

*) Preliminary estimate.
13.   The second largest component is sales taxes on petrol (YR 0.25/liter), diesel (YR 0.10/liter) and
lubricants (YR 1.225/kg) which generated YR 231 million in revenues in 1992. Contrary to most other
countries, existing fuel taxes in Yemen represent a modest source for public revenues. Being only 4.2% and
3.3% of current pump prices, existing fuel taxes on petrol and diesel must be considered very low compared
with most other countries(8). Moreover, as Yemen is self-sufficient in petroleum products and domestic
petroleum product prices are set independent of international market prices, there are no direct links between
international and domestic fuel prices which can ensure economically efficient pricing. On the contrary, the
prevailing pump prices have remained constant during a long period of high inflation (about 40 percent p.a.
at present), thus declining rapidly in real terms. Converted at the current parallel market rate of YR 60/US$
, the existing pump prices of petrol and diesel amount to USc 10 and USc 5 per liter respectively, which is
much lower than the average export value (f.o.b.) of Yemen's crude oil or refined products. Hence, in effect
there is a substantial element of implicit subsidies in current fuel prices to domestic consumers. Rather than
paying net taxes on diesel and petrol to the Government, which is the normal situation in most countries,
domestic consumers in Yemen enjoy pump prices which are far below the sum of refining costs, distribution
costs and the real economic value (i.e. export parity price) of petroleum which alternatively could be exported
to the international market.
(8)    Subsequent to the preparation of this note, in early 1995, taxes on gasoline were raised substantialy increasing fuel
prices by about 100%.

14.   Annual license fees collected from vehicle owners constitute the third most important source of
revenues. In 1991 and 1992 they were YR 190 and YR 212 million respectively. Based on a total number
of ca. 440,000 registered vehicles in 1992, the average annual license was about YR 480/vehicle (US$
8/vehicle when converted at the market rate). Heavy goods vehicles and buses pay more than cars and pick-
ups; YR 350 per tonne of gross vehicle weight for trucks and YR 50 per seat for buses, compared with YR
400 for private cars. However there is a tremendous problem related to evasion of license fees as many of
the vehicles in Yemen may not actually be registered. This makes annual license fees a somewhat uncertain,
inefficient and unequitable (penalizing honest vehicle owners) source of revenues.
Sources and Uses of Funds, GCRB 1991-1993
15.   Table 5 shows the overall Sources and Uses of Funds statements for GCRB in 1991-1993 prepared
by the Planning and Statistics Department. During the last three years around 80% of the total expenditures
(YR 3347 million) have been used for construction of new roads, while only 8.4% (YR 280 million) have
been used for rehabilitation and strengthening of paved roads, and 10.7% (YR 358 million) have been used
for ordinary maintenance. External financing in terms of loans and grants have accounted for some 25% of
total expenditures when converted to YR at the official exchange rate (YR 121US$ ), while the balance (ca.
75%) has been made up by Government contributions. There are currently no other sources of financing for
the road sector. Most of the new construction has been carried out by contractors (75%), while most of the
rehabilitation and strengthening of paved roads, and all maintenance works, have been carried out by GCRB.

16.   The foreign loans are tied to special new construction and rehabilitation projects and can therefore
generally not be reallocated to maintenance operations. The budget for general maintenance is agreed from
year to year with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and covered by the general budget. It may be noticed that
the original budget allocations for maintenance have proved insufficient every year, and that extra provisions
have been made every year since 1990. From the total road sector budget of YR 7.7 billion for the period
1991-1993, only 4.7% was allocated to preventive maintenance. This is by all means very low and not
compatible with efficient management of the road network.
Development of road maintenance between 1990-1993
17.   From previous discussions it is clear that allocations for preventive maintenance have been insufficient
for a number of years. Actual maintenance and strengthening needs have on the other hand increased rapidly
due to a combination of high age, excessive axle loads and low maintenance in the past, which has resulted
in rapid deterioration of a substantial part of the main road network. There is little evidence, however, that
the actual amount of physical resources spent on maintenance per km road has been increasing. According
to GCRB records, the total amount of patching and resealing of paved roads was 198,400 m2 in 1992,
compared with 226,700 m2 in 1991, and 204,150 m2 in 1990. Only significant increases were in
regravelling of gravel roads which increased by three times from 1990 to 1991, and almost doubled from
1991 to 1992. Although the general inflation has been high during 1991-1993, recalculation of the
maintenance expenditures in constant 1991 prices indicates a significant reduction in maintenance
expenditures (see Table 6).

Roads are not subject to routine or periodic maintenance while they undergo rehabilitation or strengthening.
V. FINANCING REHABILITATION AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE
18.   There are basically four ways to increase the funds for rehabilitation and maintenance. That is:
-     increase Government budget allocations;
-     reallocate resources from new construction of roads;
-     increase external borrowing; and
-     creation of a dedicated road fund based on additional road user charges.
19.   The budget situation is very difficult and can be expected to remain so for sometime. The current
deficit is around YR 35 billion there is tremendous pressure to cut spending and increase revenues. Hence,
there is little room for increased allocations over the ordinary budget. Reallocation of resources from new
construction would clearly be desirable, but may be politically sensitive and prove difficult in practice.

20.   In view of the high financing requirements for a stabilization program, increased external borrowing
would be required in the first years. With the current foreign exchange constraints it is quite clear that
foreign currency allocations for maintenance and rehabilitation will be difficult to obtain from the Central
Bank in the coming years, so that the immediate need for hard currency to pay for foreign contractors and
imported materials/equipment will either have to be covered by purchases in the parallel market or borrowed
abroad. Although external borrowing may be required for rehabilitation works, it cannot be recommended
that maintenance policy be based on loan financing from abroad. The Government will not (and should not)
allow for accrual of an increasing amount of new foreign debt to finance maintenance. Hence, a more
sustainable solution to the financing problem must be found. This raises the question of creating a dedicated
roadfimndforfinancing of rehabilitation and preventive maintenance based on additional road user charges.
Creation of an independent road fund
21.   A dedicated road fund has been established with success in a number of other countries, such as USA,
Japan, Tanzania, Ghana, Mozambique, Colombia and Zaire. It is nornally financed through a system of
additional road user charges or road tolls; typically levied as a fuel surcharge (say 10% - 20% of pump
prices) and special heavy vehicles license fees. Such a fund could enable the authorities to finance the
stabilization program, thus clearing the backlog within 5 (or may be 7) years.
22.   Based on the existing number of registered heavy vehicles and fuel consumption (Table 7), a menu
for different combinations of additional road user charges can be prepared as shown in Table 8. The
additional road user charges can be designed as a traditional two-part tariff, with the license fee as the access
fee, and the fuel surcharge as the user charge. For the purpose of illustration, alternative combinations have
been calculated in Table 8 in order to show the revenue effect. The basic assumptions are provided in Table
7, while the additional license fees applicable to the different vehicle types is provided in Table 8.

Structure of additional road user charges
23.    Basically, it is the heavy vehicles which damage the roads. The heavy vehicle license fee has
therefore been related to the average axle weight (number of equivalent standard axles times a base fee) of
the different vehicles according to the findings in recent axle load surveys. In this way, the heavy vehicle
license fee will be related to the damaging power of the various vehicle categories(9). For the same reason
it may be argued that thefuel surcharge should be levied on diesel only, since this is the fuel utilized by the
heavy vehicles. However, it has been suggested that the fuel surcharge should initially be levied on petrol
only as a significant part (though not more than 30%) of diesel is consumed by the agricultural sector which
is very sensitive to price changes.
24.    Hence, if the Government is willing to consider a system of increased road user charges, it is strongly
recommended that eventually a system consisting of an additional fuel surcharge levied on both diesel and
petrol in combination with an additional heavy vehicle fee be adopted as shown in Table 8. This would
provide the best incentive structure as well as the highest revenue. As an initial step, however, a surcharge
on petrol alone, together with the additional vehicle fees, would provide as much revenues as the Road
Maintenance Fund could absorb in the initial years.
Adjustment mechanism
25.    With the current high level of inflation, annualfunding requirements may increase rapidly in nominal
terms as existing unit costs, input prices and foreign exchange rate are inflated in the next years. It is
emphasized that the alternatives in Table 8 are based on the prevailing price level and rigidities in the
foreign exchange market. An appropriate and flexible adjustment mechanism must therefore be established
so that the additional road user charges can be easily adjusted to reflect inflation or exchange rate
adjustments, or in response to changing demand and priorities. The principles for calculating the user charges
remain the same so that this is only a matter of increasing the fuel surcharge and the base fee for the heavy
vehicle surcharge to reflect a new price level and exchange rate.
Advantages of an independent road fund
26.    With such an independent road fund, road users pay for the services they get from the road network,
just like consumers pay for services from other public utilities, e.g. electricity where the consumers are
charged for electricity supply, rail services where travellers pay rail fares, water supply where consumers have
to pay water charges, etc. Hence, those who benefit from having good roads will also be required to pay for
the maintenance of the roads, a system which corresponds well with established principles of benefit taxation.
27.    By creating an independent road fund, the government's fiscal situation will improve as the system
may replace current budget allocations, the heavy bill of rehabilitating and reconstructing roads later will
be reduced, and most important of all; the steep increase in road user costs which otherwise would occur
due to increased vehicle operating costs can be avoided. Hence, large economic savings will accrue to the
private sector. Moreover, as vehicle operating costs and reconstruction costs have a high foreign exchange
content, creation of a roadfund which allows for increasedfinancing of rehabilitation and maintenance will
have a positive net impact on the Balance of Payments.
(9)    The axk loadfactors used will thus have to be adjusted if new surveys indicate different axle loads, e.g. as a result
of effective enforcement of axle load regulatons. The heavy vehicle license fee can then be adjusted as it always is
calculated as the product of the number of estimated Equivalent Standard Axles per vehicle type times a basic fee
used as a scaling factor. See Table 7 and 8 for details.



Annex 2
36                                                                             Page 11 of 14
28.   Assured and reliable domestic funding can be expected to produce larger matching funds from
international aid, thus enabling an ambitious stabilization program to be carried out. Producing domestic
resources for part of the maintenance and rehabilitation needs is an important condition for securing financing
from international aid agencies. A dedicated road fund allows regular planning and efficient execution of
maintenance. Particularly when maintenance is done by contracts, it is critical to have assurance of funding
in advance, to allow a stable environment for bidding and contract commitments. A Road Maintenance Fund
provides some assurance for funding even when the general budget situation is fragile. The greater certainty
of funding may also enable more effective competitive bidding through short notices and time for preparation
and bigger lots, in stead of small extensions of existing contracts which is the typical solution when funding
is uncertain. This would bring down actual maintenance and rehabilitation costs. For instance, in Ghana this
is believed to have reduced the unit costs for maintenance by some 15% - 20%.(!o) As an idea, road-user
charges dedicated to road maintenance may also appeal to the general public which often might be frustrated
about road conditions, and thereby enable easier acceptance of the road user charges.
VI. ADMINISTRATION OF THE ROAD FUND
29.   Because deterioration of paved roads is so insidious, a road maintenance agency must regularly
monitor the condition of roads so that maintenance will not be delayed beyond the point at which costs rise
steeply. The agency must also monitor the volume and mix of traffic and axle loads to determine priorities
for investment and maintenance. An effective management information system that covers these conditions
as well as the agency's equipment, supplies, and personnel is a basic requirement for efficient planning and
deployment of resources. For maximum economic performance, road maintenance policy should be
coordinated with road design and construction planning, and the life-cycle costs of the roads should be
balanced against the operating costs of the vehicles using them. This coordination requires a good data-base
and a capable staff using sound analytical techniques and tools. Strengthening of the institutional capacity
to carry out annual maintenance planning according to sound economic principles (e.g., based on simulations
with the HDM-III model) will thus be required to efficiently use the proceeds from a Road Fund. Technical
assistance to establish this institutional capacity within a newly established Yemen Highways Board would
be provided by IDA under the proposed project.
Responsibilities and Functions of Yemen Road Fund Board
30.   The Yemen Road Fund Board (YRFB) would be responsible for planning and programming of works,
quality control, and administration of funds, and to discharge these responsibilities would need to be staffed
and empowered to:
(a)    Define and classify the road network to be preserved using RMF funding;
(b)    Manage engineering and economic studies to define multi-year road network stabilization
programs;
(c)    Develop and implement arrangements for undertaking maintenance by contract; and
(d)    Keep adequate financial controls, maintain a Management Information System with
information on vehicle operating cost savings and maintenance expenditures to allow
performance budgeting.

Board of Directors
31.   In other countries, the Board of Directors, typically consists of high ranking representatives appointed
by the Ministries of Finance, Planning, Construction and Transport, and representatives from organizations
which have a genuine interest in good roads, such as the truckers' organization, bus companies' organization,
'chamber of commerce' etc. The composition of the Board should include representatives appointed by the
Ministries of Planning, Finance, Construction and Transport representing the public sector. It was suggested
that the Trucker's Organization and the Chamber of Commerce should appoint one candidate each to
represent the transport industry and the private sector. The Board of Directors of the YRFB would therefore
consist of seven members, including the Managing Director of the YRFB who would also serve as Chairman
of the Board. The main tasks of the Board would be:
(a)    Set and revise the Road Funds objectives;
(b)    Appoint the Managing Director and Department Directors of the Road Fund;
(c)    Monitor and evaluate the performance of the Road Fund;
(d)    Approve major investment decisions requiring external funds (external borrowing);
(e)    Approve award of contracts for works; and
(f)    Recommend adjustments in the fuel surcharge, vehicle registration fees, and annual vehicle
tax.
The Board members would be appointed for three-year terms, and would be eligible for one extension.
Organization
32.   The fund can be organized according to a trustfund model, with YRFB as trustee for the funds, and
the proceeds may be used for contracts with both GCRB, local and foreign contractors. Actually, to limit
the potential for conflict between the planning and control functions and the work execution functions, the
two functions should preferably be separated with the YRFB performing the former, and public and private
contractors being responsible for works execution. The organizational structure of the YRFB would be quite
simple with only three departments: a) Planning, Programming, Budgeting & Finance; b) Contracting of
Works/ Quality Control; and c) Administrative Support, Public Relations, Personnel & Training.
33.   The existing road maintenance organization within GCRB and its facilities would be used by the
YRFB to carry out annual maintenance programs. If GCRB is lacking in capacity, private consultants and
road contractors would be utilized in order to carry out the road network stabilization program. The same
applies for road rehabilitation and reconstruction, where GCRB's construction capability would be utilized
to its practical capacity in competition with the private construction industry.

Technical Operating Procedures
34.    A major reason for establishing the YRFB is to put in place more professional, efficient and effective
technical operating procedures to plan and control the maintenance of the inter-urban national road network.
To achieve this the YRFB would have to establish and operate an appropriate road maintenance management
system. A first step in that process would be a well functioning pavement management system to allow the
remaining life of road pavements to be deternined on a system-wide basis. Some of the elements of a PMS
are: regular road inventories, road condition surveys, road usage data, and the capability to analyze the data.
The capability to establish and maintain such a system would have to be developed as part of the technical
assistance to be provided under the proposed project.
35.    Also needed is a mechanism to ensure that the fuel surcharge can be adjusted both up and down
within a reasonably short time is essential for creating a credible system. The Board of the YRFB would be
mandated to make recommendations on adjustments in the surcharges and fees, which will have to be
approved by the MOF. It is important to hit the right level and to adjust the fuel surcharge carefully during
the initial years so as not to set these too high as this could bring the fund into discredit. It is possible that
it is easier to get acceptance for a stepwise introduction of the fuel surcharge, and that gradual increases
should be allowed for when the Government feel that there is room for it and the system has provided results
in practice. This would also help to ensure that the proceeds can be absorbed and spent accordingly. This
will naturally have to be considered by the authorities, but it is extremely important that the fuel surcharge
can be adjusted in a flexible way. With the current high rate of inflation frequent increases might be
necessary to maintain the value of the fund in real terms.
36.   No counter-signatures for payments should be needed from the MOP or MOF since they would be
represented in the board anyway. The automatic release mechanisms is extremely important to assure an
uninterrupted cash flow and to encourage and get the necessary confidence from private contractors. Violation
of this principle may ultimately cause a cash-flow crisis for road contractors and actually bring down
rehabilitation and maintenance output.
Collection of user charges and initial revenues
37.    A simple arrangement for collection of the road user charges and transferring the proceeds to the
Road Fund account without delays should be established('"). The Yemen State Petroleum Company, which
is the sole distributor and supplier of petroleum fuels in Yemen, collects the existing fuel taxes for the
Govemment, and would also collect the fuel surcharges for the Road Fund which should be deposited directly
into an account in the Central Bank on a monthly basis. In addition, the vehicle fees now collected by
Customs would also be deposited in the Road Fund account. Initially, it is proposed that a YR 0.5/liter
surcharge be put on petrol only, together with a moderate increase in the heavy vehicle fee (Alternative 2 in
Table 8). This should generate about YR 900 million in additional revenues, and together with the existing
collections of about YR 300 million from vehicle registration and license fees, should result in about YR
1200 million being collected in the initial year of the Road Fund operation.
Auditing arrangements
38.    The accrual to and disbursement from the Road Fund's accounts should be subject to an independent
system of auditing and inspection. Good auditing procedures will be required so that there will be no
diversion of funds, and full transparency regarding all aspects of its operations and transactions. If the
(II)    This is extremely important in order to ensure the liquidity and flexibility of the Fund, and to ensure timely
payments to contractors so that the fund can operate in an efficient manner with optimal contract packages, and
wiLl not be brought into discredit due to erratic payment practice.

proceeds from the Road Fund should be diverted into other projects, this would undermine the confidence
in the system, and whatever support that would have been gained from road users might be lost. Annual
auditing can be carried out by a private accountant office in Sana'a.

Re: TRANSPORT RflABILITATION PROJBCT
ROAD SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICIES AND ACTIONS
Sirs,
This is to confirm the Government of Yemen's policy in the
roads sector and its commitment to undertaking actions to enhance
efficiency in the sector. The policy issues that we believe need
to be addressed in the sector are: (a) cost recovery from road
users and increased funding of road maintenance from road user
charges; and (b) truck overloading and lack of controls on
excessive axle loads.
With regard to cost recovery in the roads sector and funding
of road maintenance, it is the Covernment's policy to achieve
full cost recovery through a system of road user charges
implemented  in a phased  manner, ard  to  ensure  that  road
maintenance  is adequately funded.   in the period prior to
achieving full cost recovery, the Government would allocate funds
from the general budgat to cover the short fall in revenues from
road user charges. With respect to the problem of truck
overloading, it is the Government's policy to control axle loads,
and to establish and maintain the necessary facilities to
effectively enforce the axle load regulations-  In furth--ance
of these policies, the Government will undertake the actions set
out below.
A.   Rad Maintenance Fund and Rgad User Surchara.
Upon passage by Parliament of the law establishing the Road
Maintenance Fund (RMH) and the associated Road User Surcharge
(RUS) on fuel sales, the Ministry of Construction will establish

B.   Axle Load Controls
Upon passage by Parliament of the law un.ifyiag axle load
controls of the former Yemen Arab Republic and the former Peoples
Democratic Republic of Yemen, and upon issuance of the Prime
Minister's Decree on enforcement measures, the Ministry of
Construction will undertake implementation of the enforcement
measures specified in the decree. These measures would include
the followiLg:
(a)  Operation of weigh-bridges located at Harad, Hodeidah
and Al Mokha and conduct of axle load surveys;
(b}  Procurement and installation of weigh-bridges at Taiz
on the Sana'a-Taiz Road;
(c)  Agreement with the Tra'fic Police on schedules for
weigh-bridge operation and manning; and
(d)  Agreement with the Ministry of Finance on mechanisms
for the collection of overloading penalties.
We believe that the above measures will effectively counter
the problems which have led to deterioration of the country's
road network.

TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
Civil Aviation Sector
1.    As in the case of the roads sector, the civil aviation sector now comprises a mix of the systems that
existed, prior to unification of the country, in the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) of the former PDRY,
and in the Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority (CAMA) of the former YAR. The scope of
operations, assets and organization of the present CAMA, which absorbed CAD at unification, have
undergone radical changes first as a result of unification (1990), more recently as a result of the Gulf crisis
(1991), and finally due to the civil war (May-June, 1994) in which considerable damages were suffered at
Aden International Airport (AIA).
2.     Following unification in 1990, CAMA became responsible for the combined airspace of the unified
country, and given the vast geographical extent of the former PDRY, this was a considerable expansion in
the airspace controlled by CAMA. It also absorbed a large number of staff of the former CAD whose policy
had been to carry out most works using its own staff, whereas CAMA relied to a far greater extent on
contracting. CAMA also acquired from CAD a completely different mix of equipment, much of it supplied
from eastern bloc sources, which caused difficulties in obtaining spares, inter-operability and maintenance.
The Gulf crisis in 1991 precipitated another major change; up until then Saudi Arabia had been supporting
all air traffic services in the northern Governorates, and controlling the upper airspace from Jeddah. When
relations with Saudi Arabia deteriorated during the Gulf crisis, the Saudis withdrew their support, and the
entire responsibility, and financial burden, of managing the northern airspace fell on CAMA. The most
recent crisis, further strained CAMA due to the large losses of equipment and facilities suffered at AIA
which had become the primary base for air traffic services following the withdrawal of Saudi assistance.
These events have resulted in a considerably weakened sector significantly compromising civil aviation safety
in the country. The Civil Aviation National Plan-2005 (CANP-2005), prepared by international consultants
under European Union assistance in 1992 (prior to the most recent crisis), had identified numerous critical
deficiencies in the sector, and the losses suffered in the civil war have now exacerbated what was already
a difficult situation.
A.    Air Traffic and Forecasts
3.    CANP-2005 undertook an extensive assessment of past air traffic trends and prospects for the future,
for the 5 international and 14 domestic airports in the country. Table 3.1 below summarizes the findings
and forecasts, with the exception of data for 1993 and 1994 which were provided by CAMA. In 1990,
Sana'a handled 52% of total passenger traffic while Aden had 21 %. Results for 1994 were depressed in
general, owing to the civil war, and this was especially true for Aden which suffered a 10% drop in traffic.
Forecasts made in CANP-2005 expect the relative shares of the major airports to remain relatively stable,
with Aden registering a slightly higher growth rate and doubling its passenger traffic to almost 500,000
passengers by the year 2005. Whereas over the next ten years, passenger traffic in the country as a whole
is projected to grow at between 4 and 5% p.a., Aden's traffic is projected to grow at between 5 and 6%
p.a., while Sana'a's is expected to grow at between 3 and 4%. This reflects the expectation that Aden's
development as a regional trade centre will spur growth in air traffic.

* First nine months to Sept. 1994.
B.    Civil Aviation Services
4.    As discussed above air traffic services provided by CAMA have undergone significant changes in
recent years.  The CANP-2005 review  found a number of deficiencies in air traffic services.
Communications equipment was found to have limited coverage, was generally obsolete and lacking spares
(in many cases the spares are no longer obtainable), and had inadequate emergency power supplies at many
locations; at Aden the emergency generator was found to take 30 minutes to start. The situation with regard
to navigational aids (navaids) is similar, for instance, the ILS at Sana'a airport is considered to have a
reliability of about 40 percent; glide slope indicators at Sana'a need adjustment; and at Taiz there are no
approach lights. CANP-2005 prioritization of investment needs placed most of the communications
equipment and navigational aids requirements in the Priority 1 category. Equipment losses suffered at Aden
during the crisis, has increased the urgency for replacement of navigational and communications equipment
at Aden International Airport.
5.    By and large, the CANP-2005 review found airport facilities more satisfactory than was the case for
air traffic services and navaids. Deficiencies identified that merited a Priority 1 rating, were mainly with
regard to runway marking and lighting, and the latter are now being addressed under French bilateral
assistance. In the longer term, runway extensions are recommended for some airports (eg. Sana'a) to
accommodate larger aircraft. At Aden the control tower was found deficient because the civil apron in front
of the terminal is not visible from the tower. Since the CANP-2005 study was completed in 1992, Aden
suffered considerable damage in the recent crisis when many facilities at the airport were hit including the
international terminal, runway and the tower.
C.    CAMA Organization
6.    CAMA is an autonomous agency, under the direct responsibility of the Minister of Transport. Its
ten member Board of Directors includes senior managers of CAMA, one representative each from the
Ministry of Transport and the Air Force, and the Chairman of the national airline. The Chairman of CAMA
has executive responsibility for running CAMA, and is also Chairman of the Board. The Board functions
largely as a management committee rather than as a body which exercises oversight over the management
function.



Annex 4
44                                                                                 Page 3 of 7
7.    CAMA expects to lose many senior staff in the next five years when the staff occupying senior
positions retire. Low civil service salaries makes it difficult for CAMA to recruit and retain qualified
personnel. An experienced CAMA technician earns a third to one half the salary of a similarly qualified
technician working for the national airline, which has a special arrangement allowing much higher salary
scales. CAMA also loses trained technicians to the oil companies working in Yemen, who have a need for
trained electronics technicians. CAMA's two training institutes at Sana'a and Aden, once considered a
possible regional training site, are now barely functional.
D.    CAMA Financial Condition
8.    CAMA's financial condition is precarious, and presently its revenues barely suffice to pay for
salaries and the agency is dependent on Government subsidies to cover a bare minimum of operating
expenses. It is dependent on donor/Government funding for all its development expenditures, and even items
such as spare parts and paint for marking runways often need to be funded by donors. The reasons for
CAMA's weak financial condition include:
(a)    Low tariffs - a revision of CAMA's tariffs is now under consideration, however, even with
the tariff increase CAMA revenues will recover only two thirds of its expenditures;
(b)    Overstaffing primarily due to the absorption of large numbers of CAD staff;
(c)    Non-payment or delayed payment by the national carriers who now owe CAMA the
equivalent of a year's worth of CAMA revenues;
(d)    Loss of significant overflight revenues due to inadequacies in billing and financial systems;
and,
(e)    Arrangements whereby the national carriers pay CAMA only a small portion of ground
services charges.
CAMA's income statements for FY93, FY94, and estimates/projections for the years 1995, 2000, 2005 are
attached. The projections are made for two scenarios - retaining the present tariff and with the increased
tariff now under consideration. Even with the increased tariff, CAMA continues to make losses. It has been
found worldwide, that operating airports can be profitable, and CAMA's failure to recover costs can only
be the result of policy choices made explicitly or by default.
E.    Institutional Development
9.    In view of the present incomplete understanding of the constraints and options the civil aviation
sector faces from an institutional development standpoint, it is advisable that, as a first step, an institutional
development strategy and policy study be undertaken. Such a study would review the current situation,
identify options and recommend a course of action with regard to a number of policy areas such as role of
the private sector, organizational structure, tariff setting and financing, responsibility for negotiating bilateral
air transport agreements, staffing and training, remuneration, etc., all of which crucially impact on the
sector's ability to deliver safe and cost-effective air transport services, without burdening the government
with having to finance large deficits in CAMA's budget. The proposed project therefore includes a
component to finance such a study.

Re;TRANSPORT REHABILITATIlU PROECT
Civil Aviatiob yolicy
Sirs,
1. 'This is to confirm the Government of Yemen's commitment to
undertaking policy actions to correct various distortions and
inefficiencies presently affecting the civil aviation sector in the
country. Key policy issuea identified in the sectors are set out below;
a)   Extremely low cost recovery from users resulting in the Civil
Aviation and Mneteorological Authority (CAMA) recovering only about
35% of its costs from its own revenues and having to rely on
subsidies from the general budget;
b)   Excessive overstaffing of CAHiA. with considrable surplua in
unskilled prsonnel while there is an acute shortage of mechnical
personnel due to the inability of CAIiA to pay competitive salaries
for skilled staff; and
c)   A need to rationalize aviation infrastructure both to reduce
redundant facilities which have resulted from the unification of
the country, as well as to replace obsolete and unserviceable
equipment particularly those affecting the safety of aviation
operations in the country.
In order to address the above issues, the Government wishes to initiate
some actions the need for which are self evident, and to undrzake
studies to indentify options with regard to other areas where it is less
clear what the optimal course of action should be.
2.   It is evident that an intial tatiff increase as requested by CAMA
is needed immediately to reduce the large deficit now being incurred on
account of civil aviation by the Government. This tariff increase will
reduce CAMA's projected deficit for 1996 from about YR2SO million to
about Y1T150 million and improve cost recovery to about 70%. Furrher
tariff increases will be needed but the tariff structure will need to
be fine tuned to take into consideration the commercial situation in
various tariff segments. Such a fine tuning of the tariff structure
will be undertaken within the Civil Aviation Strategy and Policy Study
to be undrtaken urnder the subject credit, and the tariff enhancement
and cost reduction recommendations of the study will be implemented to
achieve full cost rcoe   i      Zition eostr    = _  __   _ _

The timing of thiz traiff increaze and the cost reduction measures will
be agreed during the mid-term review of the project which is scheduled
to occur before december 31,i995.
3.  Further, the Government would like to confirm its commitment to the
following three general principles for the civil aviation sector in
Yemen:
a)  that civil aviation as a sector should not receive any subsidies
from the general budget and that the Civil Aviation and
Mieteorological Authority (CAMA) should finance all operations,
mainrenance and development expenditures from its own revenues; and
b)  commercial activities that generate their own revenues, such as
various terminal operations at airports, should be privatizec.
In implementing the Civil Aviation Strategy and Policy Study. The
Government will seek ways to implement these general principles in
formulating a strategy for civil aviation development in the country.
4.  We believe the above course of action will lead to significant
improvements in the efficiency and safety of civil aviation operations
in the country.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
Project Description
1.    As the project involves two separate implementing agencies it has been sub-divided in two parts,
one for each agency, each to be implemented independently of the other.
2.    Part A: Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning would implement this part,
which includes the following components:
Road Rehabilitation
(a)    Hodeidah - Salif Road (US$10.3 million)('):  A 65 km section of this road which
connects the Port of Salif to the main road network at Hodeidah, is presently in very poor
condition. It was originally constructed as a gravel road with a thin bituminous surface treatment.
Heavy vehicle traffic associated with development of the Port of Salif for bulk cargoes, has caused
the road to deteriorate, and now the road requires reconstruction in parts and an AC overlay of
the remainder, to accommodate the increases in traffic expected with the completion of the major
grain handling port now under construction at Salif. The road also carries bulk traffic generated
by the Yemen Salt & Gypsum Co. which produces or imports about 500,000 tons of gypsum,
cement and salt at its facilities in Salif. Presently, traffic on the road is about 660 vehicles per
day on average.
(b)    Am Ayn - Naqabah Road (US$10.0 million): This component finances rehabilitation
of the northeastern 100 km of this road, with the southern section being rehabilitated by GCRB
with financing from the Government. The road section is in poor condition and will require
reconstruction over a considerable portion of its length and resurfacing/overlays on the remainder.
The road is the main link between Aden and Mukalla and carries all of the traffic between the
eastern region and the rest of the country. Presently, traffic volumes average about 1,200 vehicles
per day.
Road Maintenance Fund/Yemen Road Fund Board
(c)   Institutional Development Technical Assistance to the Yemen Road Fund Board
(US$0.74 million): Technical assistance would be provided to assist the Government in
establishing the new Road Maintenance Fund and the associated technical office to manage the
highway system including road maintenance and the Road Maintenance Fund. This component
would also assist in commercializing GCRB's and PCRC's construction and maintenance
operations by improving its cost accounting system to enable full costing in the execution and
planning of works. This would assist the Government in determining how efficient and
competitive GCRB and PCRC are in relation to the private sector road construction and
maintenance contractors. Draft TOR for this component has been reviewed by IDA.
a     These are total base costs including the Government's contribution.

(d)    Equipment, Software and Installation of a Maintenance Planning, Programming and
Budgeting System (US$2.0 million): The capacity both at the central and govemorate level for
determining maintenance needs based on regular condition surveys of the main road network is
extremely weak. Strengthening this capacity will require equipment such as Bump Integrator,
Falling Weight Deflectometers, Dynamic Cone Penetrometers, etc. It would also require
computers, software and the setting up of the system including associated training to make it
operational. Establishment of such a system will require actions both at the Office of the National
Highways Board and at the local level in the Maintenance Departments in each Govemorate. The
project will finance a contract under which an international firm will provide a comprehensive
package of support, mainly in the form of supply of necessary equipment and associated systems
needed to implement the system. TORs for this consultancy contract has been reviewed by IDA.
(e)    Study for Planning & Prioritizing Maintenance Needs (US$1.5 million): In view of
the poor performance in the area of road maintenance, the Government recently embarked on an
effort to improve planning and implementation of maintenance works for the main road network.
A study of maintenance needs for 2000 km (out of 5000 km of main roads) of "poor" and "fair"
condition roads is to be financed under the project. The study will inventory the existing
condition of the network, prioritized maintenance needs and develop detailed designs for
rehabilitation of the worst 800 kms. Rehabilitation works would be financed by the Road
Maintenance Fund (see above).
(f)   Implementation Supervision Consultants (US$1.5 million): Technical assistancewould
also be provided for construction supervision and supervision of the above project components.
A Project Implementation Unit, supported by the supervision consultants, would be established under the
Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning to oversee the components in Part A of the project.
3.    Part B: Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority would implement Part B, which mainly
comprises emergency reconstruction and technical assistance:
Emergency Rehabilitation of the Aden International Airport
(a)    Aden International Airport Terminal Reconstruction (US$7.0 million): The AIA
Terminal, which was constructed in 1986, was bombed during the civil war (May-June 1994).
The damages include about 15 percent of the civil works structures, all of the services such as the
air conditioning system, electrical system, passenger information system, baggage handling system,
etc. An assessment of the damages made by the international consultants who originally designed
the terminal has estimated the reconstruction costs. Detailed engineering of reconstruction works
is needed and is provided for under the technical assistance component (see below).
(b)    New Control Tower and Technical Building at AIA (US$6.0 million): The existing
tower and technical buildings are old and have been slated for replacement for some time. These
buildings, and the communications/navaids equipment and their repair facilities housed there, also
suffered considerable damage during the civil war. Detailed design and bidding documents for
the new tower and technical building have been prepared under French bilateral assistance, and
France has expressed its willingness to finance the equipment and related training, provided
Government arranges for construction of the tower and technical building. This project would
finance the civil works, including all building services, so as to provide completed buildings
adequate to receive the equipment (worth about US$5.0 million) to be provided under French
bilateral assistance.

Equipment
(c)    Communications and Navaids Equipment (US$5.0 million): The Control Tower and
Technical Building. Cofinancing for this equipment would need to be available by December 31,
1996.
(d)   Fire Fighting Equipment for AIA (US$1.0 million):  The project would include a
component to finance a fire fighting vehicle with accessories and spare parts for the Aden
International Airport to replace equipment that was damaged and lost during the civil war.
Technical Assistance
(e)    Civil Aviation Strategy and Policy Study (US$0.5 million): Since unification of the
country in 1990, the former Civil Aviation Department in the south was merged with the
autonomous Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority in the north. The variances in policies
of these two organizations, as well as their various incompatibilities in respect of physical plant
and equipment, continue to pose difficulties for the management and future development of
CAMA. Additionally, CAMA faces financial difficulties due to over-staffing, low tariff levels and
delays in payment by the national airlines for services provided by CAMA. Under the project an
institutional development component will be financed to review these problems and formulate
appropriate policies. Draft TORs for this component has been reviewed by IDA.
(f)    Technical Assistance for Design and Supervision (US$1.5 million):  Design and
supervision of works would be financed under this TA component.
A Project Implementation Unit, supported by the supervision consultants, would be established at CAMA
headquarters in Sana'a to oversee all components under Part B of the project.

TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
Environmental Analysis and Actions
1.     Since the project comprises of roads rehabilitation works, reconstruction of the Aden Airport terminal
and procurement of equipment, it is not expected to have any major impact on the environment.
Reconstruction of the Aden Airport terminal building and control tower are not expected to have any
significant negative environmental impacts and have therefore been excluded from this environmental
analysis. The road works are rehabilitation and maintenance along existing road alignments and these would
be prepared incorporating environmental considerations at each stage from design to completion. This Annex
sets out the mitigatory measures that would be adopted in the road rehabilitation works.
2.     Road works financed under the project would include drainage improvement, and reconstruction
of base courses and asphalt concrete overlays. Road rehabilitation and periodic maintenance will involve
no realignment (or when they are necessary, realignment will be limited to very small curve correction, or
safety related blackspot treatment). Environmental issues in the road works component mainly concern
indirect impacts. Among the issues to be considered are: drainage, erosion, quarries, sand excavation,
disposal of waste materials, and damaging effects of asphalt mix plants. The magnitude and importance of
negative impacts, together with the improvement of environmental conditions and the traffic safety will
be assessed and specific mitigatory actions carried out during implementation, as set out in the Table below.
Impacts                             Location                            Mitigation measures
Soil erosion                Cleared areas adjacent to road      Replanting of cleared areas
Water pollution from        When crossing soils with limited    Proper storage, handling and
hazardous products used in  filter power or near sensitive      disposal of hazardous products road
works.                      water bodies.                       (including lubricating oils)
Soil contamination with                                          Proper storage, handling and
hazardous products used                                         disposal of hazardous products
Dust emissions during works    Residential areas                Watering.
Vibration due to explosive                                      Controlled use of explosives
Reduction of road users                                          Traffic management for traffic
safety                                                          diversion and construction vehicles
Wastes from old pavement                                        Reuse when feasible otherwise
materials                                                       dispose at appropriate site.
3.     The road works would include the adequate environmental improvements and mitigation measures
as set out in the Table below. Works contracts would include environmental clauses, including financial
guarantees, related to: location of borrow sites; location and management of stockpiling areas and work
depots; location and pollution control of concrete and asphalt plants; location of work camps and worker

4.     TA financed under the project would assist the Yemen Road Fund Board (YRFB) in developing an
action plan to build sufficient capabilities to carry out appropriate environmental impacts analysis for its
programs and projects, and to adopt appropriate environmental guidelines and mitigatory measures for road
works. The objective of the TA in this respect is to assist YRFB creating an environmental unit to prepare
and implement an appropriate environmental management plan for the road sector. Such action would include
environmental training of the YRFB staff.
