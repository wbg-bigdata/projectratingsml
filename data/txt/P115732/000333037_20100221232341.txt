                     to mitigate the social impact o f fiscal consolidation, and the implementation o f
                     the Government's cross sector Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy (ESSNS).
                     With technical input from the World Bank, the Government has developed and
                     approved the ESSNS to finance essential services and benefits delivered by
                     national agencies, and locally by municipal governments. The ESSNS came
                     into legal effect on October 1, 2009.
                     The ESSNS finances and coordinates the efforts o f national and local
                     government agencies to: (1) maintain pre-primary education and child
                     development programs for 5 and 6 year old children; (2) cover the costs o f
                     transporting students from communities where schools have closed to their new
                     places o f instruction; (3) exempt needy households from health service co-
                     payments; and (4) subsidize their pharmaceutical costs; ( 5 ) sustain and improve
                     general practitioner (GP) and primary health care (PHC) services and access; (6)
                     increase the coverage and pay-out period o f unemployment insurance; and ( 7 )
                     increase the coverage and amount o f targeted social assistance benefits
                     administered by local governments. For the growing number o f unemployed
                     who are not covered by unemployment insurance or other social support, the
                     Government has (8) fortified the safety net by rapidly deploying a labor-
                     intensive emergency public-works programs.
Benefits             The proposed operation will help to protect vulnerable groups with emergency
                     safety net support during the economic contraction, and mitigate the social costs
                     o f an ambitious program o f fiscal consolidation while supporting important
                     structural reforms in social sector expenditure programs.
Risks                Risks to the proposed program of lending are high. Risks arise mainly from
                     m ongoing and sharp economic contraction and the size o f the needed fiscal



                                              V
adjustment Latvia has committed itself to make.
Further, unexpected economic contraction could reduce tax revenues,
which would require further fiscal adjustment. The IMF and EC led
program was based on assumptions that the economy would only contract by 5
percent in 2009 but GDP i s estimated to have contracted by 18 percent.
Although the fiscal outlook has become more stable, considerable uncertainty
remains.
The program faces considerable macroeconomic risks that lower the
likelihood o f a quick recovery. The Government i s undertaking a very
ambitious economic adjustment program based on a macroeconomic strategy
that includes severe fiscal consolidation measures and wage cuts under the fixed
exchange rate regime. The severity of the measures may make them difficult to
implement. Also, the much higher government deficits will make it harder to
meet the Maastricht criteria and may delay the program's exit strategy o f Euro
adoption. Deflation may be even deeper than currently projected, which could
also jeopardize Euro adoption. However, the economy may also recover faster
than expected if global growth resumes faster. These risks are mitigated by the
size o f the multilateral financial package, equivalent to 35 percent of GDP, in
support o f the Government's program. In addition, the support of Latvia's
international partners, particularly the EU, represents a key safeguard to the
program. The EU's commitment of 3.1 billion under the international support
package has provided space for implementation of the programmed reforms. I n
a July 27press statement announcing their disbursement o 1.2 billion, the EU
                                                            f
aflrmed that it will continue to work closely with the Latvian authorities and the
IMF to ensure Latvia implements successfully its economic reform program and
repays in a timely manner all loans associated with the international program
to support Latvia. Thus, while the risks are signifcant, continued current
account surpluses, Latvia's strong commitment to the program, expected
improvements in global financing conditions, and E U support provide
safeguards.

The ESSNS may not be sufficient to address the social costs inflicted by the
speed of fiscal adjustment and structural reforms. The fiscal adjustment
Latvia undertook in the second half o f 2009 and i s committed to undertake in
2010 and 201 1 i s substantial and would be difficult even in a non-recession
environment. The sheer size and speed of the adjustment raises the risks of
adverse impact on households. Of particular concern i s the structure o f means
tested minimum income assistance - the most decentralized in the ECA region.
Decentralized provision o f social assistance, particularly in the context of the
extraordinary economic contraction, can lead to gaps in the safety net across
municipalities of different wealth. A key part o the Government's ESSNS is to
                                                f
provide contingent financing for the GMI, as well as to raise the income
threshold for households to qual13 for assistance. These measures, as well as
                f
the deployment o the new Workplaces with Stipend public works program, can
help to contain social costs. I n dialogue with the Bank team the Government
agreed to expand the ESSNS package to include strengthening GP/PHC
services with pub@ health nurses. Implementation and adequacy o ESSNS   f
measures is being monitored on regular basis. Should the ESSNS allocations in
the 201 0 budget prove inadequate, the Government could consider a further
temporary extension o unemployment insurance; a larger deployment o
                        f                                                       f
                                                              f
emergency public works; and increasing the co-financing o GMI. Program
oartners have agreed to provide leeway in fiscal adjustment targets to
accommodate additional safety net measures.

                      The difficulty of structural reforms during a period of severe and
                      prolonged economic recession could trigger a backlash or reversion to past
                      practices. The Government will need to continue explaining why structural
                      reforms are necessary and how these measures will lead to improvements in the
                      medium term. This has proven to be a difficult task in 2008 and 2009 as
                      conditions continued to worsen. Even early in the IMF-led program, there were
                      violent protests against the first changes to the 2009 budget. Although the
                      bottoming out o f Latvia's economic decline has lowered resistance and there i s
                      widespread acceptance o f the measures the Government i s taking, more can be
                      done to increase information and public awareness. The Bank team supports a
                      proactive effort by the Government to explain the needfor fiscal adjustment and
                      the rationale for reform, having participated in several instances, in key
                      discussions with social partners.       The Bank team has engaged local
                                                                       f
                      communications experts to help clarijj the role o the institution in the overall
                      international assistance effort. The Bank encouraged and assisted in the
                                    f                                                   f
                      development o the emergency social safety net to mitigate some o the negative
                      impacts o the fiscal consolidation and economic crisis, and supported the
                                f
                      Government's strategy to be widely publicized.
                      Budget reductions of this speed and breadth are unprecedented in most
                      countries, and the success of structural reforms depends on the quality of
                      implementation in a very difficult political climate. Success requires difficult
                      decisions to be made at the local level, as general elections grow nearer. The
                      Bank will remain engaged through this two-loan program to monitor how
                      structural reforms are being implemented in the education and health sectors, to
                      inform the ongoing process o rationalization, and to adjust the content o the
                                                    f                                           f

               SAFETY NET AND SOCIAL SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM


                                       .
                                      IINTRODUCTION

 1.     The Republic o f Latvia has requested Special Development Policy Lending (SDPL)
support from the World Bank as part o f the package o f emergency assistance agreed
between the Government, t h e International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European
Commission (EC), Nordic and other European countries, to limit and contain the damage
o f a financial crisis and rapid economic contraction. The package o f EUR7.5 billion
(balance-of-payments and budget assistance) which was approved on December 23, 2008
supports a program o f financial sector, fiscal consolidation and structural reforms extending
through March 201 1, The package i s designed to address severe macroeconomic and fiscal
imbalances and financial vulnerabilities that have grown worse in the wake o f the global
economic and financial crisis.

2.     The SDPL assistance from the World Bank i s being delivered in two parallel
programs, one supporting reforms t o strengthen the financial sector, and the other
providing support f o r an emergency safety net and social sector reform. The two program
teams have worked in parallel to ensure the Bank can react to the demands o f the Government
and international partners with speed and flexibility, in a fluid macroeconomic and political
environment. The World Bank's Financial Sector Development Policy Loan o f EUR 200 million
to support financial sector strengthening, was approved by the Board on September 22, 2009,
and was fully disbursed o n November 4,2009.

3.      This i s the f i r s t o f a proposed program o f two loans focused on Safety N e t Support
and Social Sector Reform. The objectives o f the proposed program are: (i) protect       to
vulnerable groups with emergency safety net support during the economic contraction; (ii)       to
mitigate the social costs o f fiscal consolidation; and (iii) ensure structural reforms lay a
                                                                 to
foundation for medium t e r m improvements in the social sectors. Given the deep impact Latvia
has suffered in the wake o f the global crisis, and due to the emergency nature o f this proposed
program, the first operation will focus mainly on the first and second objectives. The second
operation will expand this focus to the third objective.

4.     The financial crisis hit Latvia at a time when the country was particularly
vulnerable, and i t s impact has been felt more deeply than elsewhere in the region the      -
economy i s estimated t o have declined by 18 percent in 2009 and t o further contract by 4


                                               1
percent in 2010. In the years following i t s accession to the EU, Latvia ran up a large current
account deficit, high external debt, and a very high loan to deposit ratio in the financial sector.
Concerns among non-resident and foreign banks about their overexposure resulted in a sharp
slowdown in credit and have led to a significant downturn in domestic economic activity. In
2009, domestic demand contracted more sharply than expected. Given that the Government
intends to continue with efforts to contain the budget deficit, fiscal cuts are expected to lower
GDP further in 2010 (minus 4 percent). GDP growth i s likely to resume in the last two quarters
o f 2010 and in 201 1, when output i s projected to grow again by 2.7 percent.

 5.      Having decided to pursue a strategy of internal adjustment by retaining its
 exchange rate peg to the Euro, the Government undertook a severe and rapid fiscal
 consolidation in 2009, which has been met with stoic resolve by the public. Sharp cuts in
 spending along with increased taxes and direct efforts to lower public sector wages have been
deployed to lower real wages and aggregate demand. In a small, open economy that was already
contracting in the wake o f the global financial and economic crisis, these adjustment measures
have wrought heavy social costs measured in higher unemployment, poverty and inequality.
Despite this, the political environment has remained stable. After street protests in January and
February, the resignation o f the Godmanis Administration on February 26, 2009, and the
instatement o f a new Dombrovskis Government, the public have been, at least on the surface,
resigned to the measures taken. Migration o f Latvians abroad, which accelerated after accession
to the EU in 2004, may have released some o f the social tension from widespread j o b losses but
raises concern for the loss o f skilled labor.' The fast growth o f the economy, with real gains in
GDP o f just under 10 percent per year from 2004 to 2007, means that even with the sudden
contraction o f 2008 and 2009, real GDP i s just back to the level o f 2006. The Government's
attempts to guide the process o f fiscal consolidation with needed structural reforms and to
provide emergency safety net support may also have helped to sustain a social compact o f
support for the adjustment strategy it has chosen. Finally, local elections in June 2009 and
national elections planned for October 2010 have and will provide opportunities for the
electorate to assess and weigh in on the situation. For example, in the June 6, 2009 election,
more than half o f Riga City Council's 60 incumbents failed to win re-election. The previous
mayor's party failed to win any seats, and power shifted to a center-left coalition that vowed to
reduce the size o f the public administration to maintain spending on services. Although social
stability is far from assured, these factors plus the apparent bottoming out o f several economic
indicators in the autumn o f 2009 and the implementation o f the emergency social safety net
beginning on October 1, give rise to hope that the calm in 2009 may continue.

6.      The Government i s committed to structural reforms that will help achieve fiscal
consolidation targets agreed as part of the program with the IMF, EC, Nordic and other
European countries. The most important social sector and public administration measures being
taken are: in the education sector, the introduction o f `tfunds follow the student" financing in the
2009 academic year; and in the health sector, a reduction in the number o f hospital beds, more
effective use o f copayments to control demand for services, and reductions o f excessive costs by
shifting health care toward out-patient and hospital day-care procedures. Additionally, reforms
have been passed that will increase the efficiency o f social protection by eliminating overlapping
benefits and improving the long-term financial sustainability o f old-age pensions and other forms

o f social insurance. Moreover, measures are planned to consolidate and professionalize the
public administration by improving human resource management and increasing transparency in
the management o f state owned enterprises (SOEs). This package o f measures implemented by
the Ministry o f Education and Science (MoES), the Ministry o f Health (MoH), the Ministry of
Welfare (MOW),the Ministry o f Regional Development and Local Government (MoRDLG), and
the State Chancellery and their subordinate agencies, will deliver fiscal savings required as part
o f the program agreed with international partners, as well as contribute to greater efficiency and
efficacy o f social services and public administration in the medium and long term.

7.      T h e proposed program o f W o r l d Bank support will focus on measures designed to
mitigate the social impact o f fiscal consolidation, and on the implementation o f the
Government's cross sector Emergency Social Safety N e t Strategy. As structural reforms are
implemented, the Government i s committed to alleviating the social costs o f the transition to new
financing and service delivery models in the education and health sectors, in order to ensure an
adequate level o f service provision i s maintained across the country. Moreover, in the context o f
the current economic contraction and high levels o f unemployment, this commitment extends to
strengthening the safety net to respond to the immediate needs o f vulnerable households. With
technical input from the World Bank, the Government has developed and approved an
Emergency Social Safety N e t Strategy (ESSNS) to finance essential services and benefits
delivered by national agencies, and locally by municipal governments. The ESSNS came into
legal effect on October 1, 2009.

8.      T h e Emergency Social Safety N e t Strategy underpins fiscal consolidation and
structural reforms by deploying supplementary support to ensure basic social services are
maintained. The strategy finances and coordinates the efforts o f national and local government
agencies to: (1) maintain pre-primary education and child development programs for 5 and 6
year old children; (2) cover the costs o f transporting students from communities where schools
have closed to their new places o f instruction; (3) exempt needy households from health service
co-payments; and (4) subsidize their pharmaceutical costs; (5) sustain and improve general
practitioner (GP) and primary health care (PHC) services and access; (6) increase the coverage
and pay-out period o f unemployment insurance; and (7) increase the coverage and amount o f
targeted social assistance benefits administered by local governments. For the growing number
o f unemployed who are not covered by unemployment insurance or other social support, the
Government has (8) fortified the Emergency Social Safety Net by re-allocating financing from
the European Social Fund (ESF) to expand and rapidly deploy labor-intensive emergency public-
works programs.

9.       T o increase transparency and accountability, the Emergency Social Safety N e t
Strategy includes procedures for and adequate financing to closely monitor i t s
implementation and rigorously evaluate i t s impact. The World Bank team would coordinate
the timing o f i t s assessment o f performance under the first loan in the program with the Republic
o f Latvia State Audit Office's (SAO) possible audit o f the Government's performance in meeting
its targets for the first year o f implementation o f the ESSNS. If the government's performance i s
audited, we will use i t s findings to discuss how to improve performance during the second year
o f program implementation. This i s an important innovation o f the proposed lending program
that complements the Bank's normal program supervision and strengthens Latvia's existing
institutions for greater governance and accountability.

10.    Following its accession into the European Union (EU) in 2004 until 2007,
the Latvian economy experienced rapid economic growth averaging over 10 percent per
year (see Table 1). High economic growth was driven almost entirely by domestic demand,
encouraged by rapid credit growth and large real wage increases. With expectations o f a rapid
catching-up with EU living standards, the country also experienced a consumption and real estate
boom.

11.    Pro-cyclical fiscal policy further fueled the domestic boom. Public expenditure grew
by 80 percent (in real terms) between 2003 and 2007 as the authorities spent cyclically strong tax
revenues. The fiscal balance remained in deficit in most years (except in 2007 when the budget
saw a small surplus o f 0.7 percent o f GDP). Large wage increases in the public sector
contributed both to maintaining a premium over average wages in the private sector, and to

                                                                    4
crowding out fiscal space for productive spending in human and physical capital. Pension
benefits linked to wage growth rose in parallel.

12.     Excessive domestic demand translated into large and widening macroeconomic
imbalances and a build-up o f vulnerabilities (Table 2). Consumer inflation rose from
6.2 percent in 2004 to over 10 percent in 2007. Rapid wage dynamics outstripped productivity
growth undermining Latvia's international competitiveness. The current account deficit widened
from 13 percent o f GDP in 2004 to almost 23 percent o f GDP in 2007.

13.    The expansion o f credit was largely financed by short-term external borrowing
from private banks, resulting in the highest loan to deposit ratio o f the banking sector in
the region (248 percent in 2007). For foreign owned banks, which accounted for 77 percent o f
banking assets at the end o f 2007, their parent institutions (mainly Swedish banks) were the main
source o f financing-and much o f it was extended short-term in that year. B y contrast,
domestically owned banks relied substantially on short-term syndicated loans as well as non-
resident deposits. As a result o f these developments, Latvia's external debt to GDP rose from
90 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 128 percent by 2007, with short term debt rising to over 55 percent
o f GDP in 2007.

14.     The growth in domestic credit resulted in rising household and corporate
indebtedness. The indebtedness o f corporate entities and households more than tripled between
2004 and 2007, exceeding 80 percent o f GDP. The share o f loans to households in total bank
assets rose to 28 percent by end 2007 (equivalent to 40 percent o f GDP, up from 18 percent o f
GDP in 2004). The amount o f outstanding mortgage loans almost doubled each year until mid-
2007.

 15.     By 2008 the need for a macroeconomic correction was increasingly evident.
Domestic credit slowed down sharply as banks became more aware o f rising risks, and growth
slowed down sharply. Unfortunately, wages and fiscal policy failed to adjust in time to
the rapidly deteriorating environment, taking their toll on the competitiveness and fiscal position.
In fact, public spending increased further in 2008 despite the accumulating evidence o f economic
over-heating and worrisome indications o f increased external and financial vulnerability.

16.    Against the background o f the re-pricing o f risk in emerging markets, the currency
peg came under pressure in September 2008. B y November 2008, the Bank o f Latvia's
foreign exchange reserves had fallen by 20 percent to euro 3.4 billion. Latvia was soon after
downgraded by rating agencies and i t s Eurobond spread increased to around 600 basis points,
while the 5-year Credit Default Swap (CDS) spread jumped to around 1,000 basis points in
November 2008.

17.    The global financial crisis thus hit Latvia at a time when the country was highly
vulnerable (Table 2). While the banking sector had entered the crisis with relatively favorable




                                                                    6
financial stability indicatorsY2and while the introduction o f financial support schemes by the
home authorities o f foreign owned banks had helped stabilize the deposit base o f their
subsidiaries, locally owned banks (reliant as they were o n more fragile forms o f finance, as noted
above) came under considerable pressures given the worsened global liquidity conditions in late
2008. Non-resident deposits were particularly affected, with Parex Bank-the largest domestic
bank and the second largest bank in Latvia-losing one quarter o f i t s deposits between end
August and November 2008. By late 2008, it also became increasingly clear that syndicated
lenders would experience growing difficulties in refinancing their loans.

2S(b) The Stabilization Program
 18.    I t i s against this rapidly deteriorating background that, in December 2008,
the Latvian authorities called on international support and agreed to a stabilization
program. The program was supported by the EC, the IMF, EBRD, and the World Bank, and was
complemented by bilateral financial support from Nordic and Central European countries3.
The authorities chose to maintain the exchange rate peg after taking into consideration
the balance sheet effect o f a potential devaluation, and the severe corporate, banking and social
risks that i t s removal would entail. In addition, there were fears o f contagion to neighboring
countries (Latvian devaluation would put pressure on the other Central and Eastern European
countries currency boards, and could trigger severe exchange rates instability in the larger
region). Maintaining the peg was also considered as the best way to facilitate the adoption o f
euro in the medium term-anatural          exit strategy to the existing exchange rate peg. The
stabilization package totaling 7.5 billion (or more than 35 percent o f GDP) thus relied mostly
on financial sector stabilization and strong domestic adjustment policies to achieve internal
devaluation and restore the country's competitiveness-but       at the cost o f a sharp, and likely
protracted, output contraction.

 19.      An immediate priority was to stabilize the banking sector. Financial sector measures
aimed at stemming the loss o f the bank deposit, particularly in the domestically-owned Parex
Bank and to restore confidence in the banking system in the medium term. The government took
over the bank and negotiated a rescheduling o f i t s syndicated loans. In order to reduce deposit
outflows, the authorities also put limits on deposit withdrawals at this bank. In M a y 2009, the
Privatization Agency made an investment o f about LVL 141 million, on behalf o f the state, into
Parex Bank's capital and issued a subordinated loan in the amount o f LVLSO million, bringing
i t s capital adequacy to about 11 percent. EBRD has also made an investment in Parex Bank-
effective September 2009 acquiring 25 percent plus one share. While these measures have
stabilized the bank, a final resolution i s awaiting the conclusion o f a dispute on state aid issues
with the European Commission's (EC) DG on competition policies.

20.    Macroeconomic stabilization, however, proved initially m o r e difficult to achieve as
the economy went into a tailspin. Real GDP fell by more than 18 percent in the first half o f
2009 compared with the 2008 program projection o f a 5 percent decline for the whole 2009.
The main causes were the bursting o f credit and real estate bubbles and a collapse in domestic

  At the end o f 2007, the capital adequacy ratio stood at I 1 percent, the liquidity ratio (liquid assets as a proportion o f liabilities
maturing in 30 days) at more than 55 percent (above the regulatory minimum o f 30 percent), the Return on Assets (ROA) at
2 percent, and the Return on Equity (ROE) at 24 percent.

demand. Moreover, the deeper-than-projected downturn was also due to the worse than
anticipated external environment. Instead o f increasing by 1`/z percent (as envisaged when
the IMF-supported program was approved in late 2008), output growth among Latvia's main
trading partners was revised to a projected decline o f 5 percent in 2009. With the sharp economic
downturn, unemployment rose significantly and reached 16.7 percent in the second quarter o f
2009 up from 6.3 percent year ago. Much o f the poverty and social impacts o f the economic
contraction can be traced to these adverse developments in the labor markets (see Section 2.3).

21.      Therefore, the need for a stronger fiscal correction than initially programmed was
inevitable. The initial spending cut measures, unevenly implemented for most o f the first half o f
2009, proved insufficient in curbing past spending trends in light o f more severe economic
conditions. With revenues plummeting as a result o f the output contraction, the fiscal deficit
initially widened well into double digits (as a percent o f GDP).

22.      I t i s only with the supplemental budget of June 2009 that the authorities managed to
get the fiscal accounts under control. The latter involved additional measures o f
LVL500 million aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit to 13 percent o f GDP. O n the revenue side,
measures amounting to 0.6 percent o f GDP were introduced and included higher excise tax rates,
lowering the threshold o f tax-exempt income, and increases in state revenue from dividends. O n
the expenditure side, the spending reductions amounting to 5.5 percent o f GDP came from
a lower wage bill (reflecting a nominal wage reduction and a fall in public sector employment)
and lower social transfers (including a 10 percent nominal pension cut and a 70 percent reduction
o f pensions for working pension recipient^).^

23.      Given the government's successful implementation of the supplemental budget, it
the fiscal outturn for 2009 i s now estimated to have been better than had been programmed
(at the time o f the supplemental budget) and that the general government deficit may fall to
8percent of GDP (see Table 3). O n the revenue side, tax revenues have been higher than
program projections. The higher than programmed revenues partly reflect the accounting effect
o f the diversion o f second pillar pension fund contributions to the first pillar as a revenue item
(contribution rates will be reverted to the private pillar in phases, but not fully, by January
201 l).5 In addition, revenues from EU transfers have been higher than projected (0.5 percent o f
GDP). O n the spending side, lower spending on capital and untargeted social benefits have
brought down the primary deficit and lower financing costs have reduced interest rate
expenditures in the budget. Also, fiscal space for emergency social safety net spending provided
under the program (1 percent o f GDP) was underutilized (LVL 14 million or 0.1 percent o f
GDP).

  On December 2 1, 2009, the Constitutional Court ruled that the government's decision to reduce pensions was unconstitutional.
The ruling requires the government to (i)   refund the withheld pensions ( L V L 73.7 million) by 2015, and (ii)start to pay pensions
in full from February 1 ( L V L 110.9 million in 2010).
  From 2009 to 2010, the contribution rate to the private pillar was reduced from 8 percent o f a worker's salary to 2 percent. I n
January 2010, the contribution will be raised to 4 percentage points, and in January 201 I to 6 points. After 201 1, contributions to
the private pillar remain at 6 percent. Prior to the amendment, the contribution was to rise to 10 percent in 2011. The
Government believes this temporary infusion i s necessary to (i) avoid deeper cuts cutting pensions in payment; and (ii)to
eliminate the need for transfers to the social insurance budget from general revenues to make up for the fall in contribution
revenue as unemployment rises.

24.     I n 2009, the supplemental budget adjustment o f fiscal expenditures has been
achieved mainly through administrative cuts and less through structural measures.
Administrative cuts were across ministries, including a reduction in the public sector wage bill.
The central government reduced the public sector wage bill significantly by cutting 6,000
workers in the third quarter and applying a 20 percent average cut to the remainder o f i t s work
force. Administrative spending has also been reduced by merging some institutions. Among
positive structural measures there have been those launched in health and education such as
optimizing the number o f hospitals, schools and teachers.

25.     A necessary price and wage correction i s now underway, with inflation falling
rapidly from double digits in 2008 into deflation at the end o f 2009; nominal wages are
following suit. Month-on-month consumer prices have been falling since this past spring. In
November 2009, CPI inflation was down to minus 1 ?4percent year-on-year. Gross wages were
down by 6.4 percent year on year in the third quarter with public sector wages falling faster (13
percent) than those o f the private sector (3.7 percent). As a result o f internal deflation, the real
effective exchange rate (deflated by CPI)6 has depreciated by 5 percent since i t s record level in
March 2009.




6
  Preliminary data suggest that producer price and unit labor cost deflated real effective exchange rate have also depreciated by
around 7 and 11 percent from their peaks, respectively.

26.     T h e sharp decline in economic activity has masked the better than projected
contribution o f net exports to growth (13 percentage points in 2009). Indeed, the external
current account swung into surplus. In the first nine months o f 2009, the current account surplus
reached 7.2 percent o f GDP (annualized) compared to a deficit o f 13 percent a year earlier. This
turnaround reflects an improving income balance due to foreign banks' provisioning for non-
performing loans, but there i s no real capital inflow. However, significant contribution o f the
surplus comes from decreasing foreign trade deficit and the stable positive balance o f services,
both o f which have led to a surplus o f the balance o f goods and services (last recorded in 1994).
After excluding the above mentioned provisioning, the current account i s to remain in surplus o f
around 3 percent o f GDP in 2009.

27.     On the financing side, private capital outflows have been less severe than feared,
reflecting in p a r t the confidence impact o f recent disbursements by the international
lenders. While rollover rates by Nordic banks have been within program parameters, corporate
borrowing has continued to be higher than projected. Furthermore, after dropping by more than
L V L l billion since beginning o f 2008, non-resident deposits have been quite stable since late
M a y 2009. Sizable external official support further shored up the balance o f payments. This
support came essentially in two waves: first, in early 2009 upon the approval o f the stabilization
package and, then, following the supplementary budget o f mid-2009 when the international
lenders approved their next tranches o f financial support. On June 26,2009, the EC approved the
disbursement o f i t s second tranche o f 1.2 billion. Subsequently, on August 27, the IMF
concluded i t s First Review and disbursed the second tranche o f about 200 million. The World
Bank's Financial Sector Development Policy Loan o f 200 million was approved on September
22,2009 and disbursed fully on November 4, 2009.




                                                                    10
28.     The stabilization efforts of the authorities under the Program have so far helped
stabilize financial markets as evidenced by very l o w domestic interest rates, halved CDS
spread, and limited foreign exchange interventions since summer 2009. The State Treasury has
also succeeded in extending maturities o f all one-month T-bills to 6- and 12-month in
the domestic debt market.

2.2. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

29.      The coordinated efforts o f the Government of Latvia appear to be bearing positive
results in stabilizing the economy, but significant macroeconomic adjustment challenges
still lie ahead. Continued fiscal consolidation remains essential given the adjustment strategy
chosen by the Latvian authorities. Key to the success o f internal devaluation i s continuous price
and wage correction in order to regain an effective degree o f competitiveness. Further
stabilization o f the domestic banking sector is critical to restoring i t s soundness and renewing
access to international capital markets. In order to complete the stabilization program, substantial
official financing i s expected to be provided by international and bilateral lenders.

 30.     The 2010 deficit i s programmed to be 8.6 percent of GDP. O n December 1, 2009,
the Parliament (Saeima) approved the 20 10 budget which i s designed to lower Latvia's 20 10
general government deficit by LVLSOO million (4.2 percent o f GDP) as agreed within the revised
 stabilization program in June 2009. The budget includes measures on broadening the revenues
base (2.3 percent o f GDP) and cuts in expenditure (1.9 percent o f GDP). Following on measures
introduced in 2009 to protect the poor, the 20 10 deficit target allows for an additional maximum
 !h percent o f GDP o f social safety net spendin if the authorities deem i t appropriate to ease
social hardship if more severe than expected.' In addition, the 2010 deficit accommodates
the Constitutional Court ruling o f December 21, 2009 that the June pension cuts were
unconstitutional. After consulting the E C and IMF, the government will resume payment o f
pensions in full in February 2010 (around L V L l 10 million, 1 percent o f GDP) and will refund
                                                                     h
the 2009 withheld pensions as a lump sum in April 2010 (around ! percent o f GDP). I t will also
introduce new budgetary measures for 2011 and beyond to claw back the increased pension
spending arising from the court ruling.

3 1.    Despite enormous fiscal consolidation in 2009-10, Latvia's fiscal policy continues to
face unprecedented challenges due to still high fiscal imbalances compared to
the authorities' fiscal target of meeting the Maastricht fiscal criterion in 2012. A sizeable
fiscal adjustment o f around LVL800-900 million' will need to be spread over 201 1 and 2012 in
order to achieve programmed fiscal deficits o f 6.5 percent and 3.6 percent o f GDP, respectively.
The authorities have committed to identifying necessary measures to deliver the above
mentioned targets. I t was also agreed that the authorities will work with the E C and World Bank
on a new public expenditure review in order to identify areas for expenditure savings that will be
sustainable over the medium term. The objective i s to design a menu o f available options for
the next government.



'The need, scope and design o f the social safety net measures will be explored in more details during the next review.
 The amount includes the authorities' commitment to compensate for the increased pension spending arising from the December
2009 Constitutional Court ruling.


                                                              11
32.     The authorities have requested to extend the program till end 2011 and re-phase its
disbursement schedule (see below). This extension, made possible by better than expected
financing conditions in 2009', i s recognition that sustainable macroeconomic adjustment will
take longer than initially programmed. Continued involvement o f the international lenders
beyond the elections in October 2010 should provide assurances to financial markets that
the authorities will continue with consistent and sustainable policies over the medium term.
Access under the Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF will remain unchanged.

33.     The extension of the program will help the medium-term fiscal adjustment and use
the 2009 good performance in support of upcoming government elections in October 2010.
This extension will allow for a continuous focus on medium-term tasks such as designing
sustainable structural fiscal measures, developing a medium-term fiscal framework, etc. I t will
also cover the preparation o f the 2012 budget which i s key to bringing the deficit within
3 percent o f GDP as required by the Maastricht criterion.

34.     With continued fiscal retrenchment, positive GDP growth i s unlikely to resume
quickly. The 20 10 fiscal adjustment will continue to restrain domestic demand. Expected further
job and wage cuts will lower disposable incomes o f households and limited bank lending (due to
over-indebtedness) will keep consumer spending suppressed. Real GDP is projected to fall by
4 percent in 20 10, with domestic demand decreasing by 9 percent (see Table 4).




9
  The NIR target for 2009 will likely be exceeded by a very substantial margin and further accumulation o f reserves i s anticipated
in 2010. Therefore, there i s room for shifting some portion o f the financing access into 201 1.


                                                              12

35.    However, recent gains in competitiveness" and a more favorable global economic
outlook in 2010 are expected to invigorate the tradable sector. Exports are likely to increase
by 1.5 percent in 2010 and imports are anticipated to decline by 10 percent in 2010 given
the continued contraction in domestic demand. As a result, net exports are projected to mitigate
the impact o f falling domestic demand, with a positive contribution (5 percentage points) to real
GDP in 20 10.

36.     O v e r the medium term, recovery to higher and sustainable growth will require
a continued structural adjustment o f the economy towards the tradable sectors. Pre-crisis
growth was heavily dependent on unsustainable developments in non-tradables, particularly in
real estate. Future growth should come more from the tradable sectors. The adjustment o f


IoSince March 2009, the real exchange rate has depreciated by 5 percent, about one-quarter o f which i s due to nominal
appreciation o f trading partners. Also, producer price and unit labor cost deflated real effective exchange rate have depreciated by
7 and 11 percent from their peaks, respectively.


                                                               13
domestic costs required by the stabilization program should not only put the economy on
a stronger footing and strengthen export-based recovery, but should stimulate new investment in
export-oriented industries. Such an adjustment i s likely to remain gradual. The current projection
o f the program expects real GDP to grow around 4 percent annually in 2012-14.

37.     The labor market will continue to bear the brunt o f the adjustment as economic
activity remains depressed. The unemployment rate i s expected to be at about 20percent in
2010, up from 17.5 percent in 2009. In 2010, the average gross monthly wage i s expected to
decline by 10 percent. Such wage correction i s an inevitable part o f the overall stabilization
program. However, it i s associated with risks o f social tensions and political instability.
The latter in turn may undermine efforts o f the authorities and international community if it i s
not accompanied by a well coordinated and an improved social safety net.

38.     Internal price adjustment will continue. Annual average deflation i s expected to reach
a rate o f minus 3.7 percent in 2010 given the continuing negative output gap, falling wages and
contracting domestic demand. The falling prices will provide additional real income to
households, but this i s unlikely to be enough to offset the large fall in wages and social benefits
coming from program adjustments.

39.     Latvia's external imbalances are set to narrow. The subdued domestic and improving
foreign demands, as well as ongoing adjustment o f domestic costs should facilitate export-based
recovery. The current account surplus o f 3 percent o f GDP in 2009 (excluding provisioning by
foreign banks o f their non-performing loans)" i s projected to improve further to around 8.4 and
8.8 percent o f GDP in 2010 and 201 1, respectively, before narrowing later on as recovery
intensifies and growth takes over.

40.     Although Latvia's external vulnerability i s expected to be reduced by the projected
current account surpluses, the balance o f payments will still face contingent risks. Capital
flows remains uncertain. Both foreign-owned and domestically-owned banks will need to repay
to their parents or their maturing syndicated loans, respectively. Non-resident deposits have
stabilized due to continuing restrictions on deposits at Parex Bank, but after their removal, non-
resident deposits will likely decline over time to find their new steady state. Size and speed o f
capital flows will depend on restoring confidence in the banking sector and investment
opportunities, particularly in the tradable sector.

41.    Further consolidation o f the banking sector remains therefore key for the success o f
the program. Following an unprecedented expansion in the pre-crisis period, the banking sector
has been affected by reduction o f output and rising unemployment, and remains under pressure
from increasing overdue loans, liquidity and funding risks. l2Therefore, the authorities have been
working with the international partners on improving financial system conditions (e.g., by
streamlining insolvency procedures and preparing guidelines for out-of-court mortgage



'I 7.7 percent of GDP for 2009 reflected in Table 1 and 4 includes provisioning by foreign banks o f their non-performing loans
which improves the income balance, but there i s no real inflow.
12
   I n October 2009, the non-performing loan ratio reached nearly 15 percent and the provisioning losses totaled 5 percent o f
GDP. In an effort to maintain the system-wide capital adequacy ratio at 13 percent, the banks reduced the level o f lending.
The stock of credit to both households and corporate has fallen by five percent since the beginning o f 2009.


                                                            14
workouts), as well as mitigating the impact o f any future crisis through completing work on
contingency planning, remedial action guidelines, and improved supervision and monitoring.

42.     The completion o f restructuring o f two state-owned banks, namely Mortgage and
Land Bank ("MLB") and Parex Bank i s essential to restore financial stability of
the banking system. MLB has sustained large losses and required two capital injections in 2009
(the second s t i l l to be approved by EC). The intention i s to refocus MLB's activities to
development lending, (SMEs, business start-ups, infrastructure, etc.) and separate non-
performing assets into an independent asset management company. As for Parex Bank,
the Latvian government cannot reorganize or recapitalize i t again until the EC's DG Competition
completes the review o f the first capital injection-as noted earlier. Also, the g~vernment'~ in
cooperation with EBRD intends to prepare a comprehensive plan to handle non-performing and
non-core assets and will submit the plan to the E C by end March 20 10.

43.     There i s strong regional support from the large Nordic banks to ensure adequate
capital and liquidity in their Latvian branches. The 2009 September's coordination meeting
in Stockholm confirmed this support conditional on how nominal GDP evolves and availability
o f sound business opportunities. The willingness o f these banks to make bilateral commitments
in the next stage o f the process remains; however increased lending will likely be affected by
global deleveraging. Nevertheless, the international lenders and the authorities will continue to
seek more detailed and timely commitments from the key Nordic banks. The FCMC/BOL will
monitor these banks' exposure and share information with foreign supervisors and central banks.

44.     With this, the projected external financing requirements o f euro 8.9 billion in 2010
and 2011 (see Table 5) are expected to be fully covered and no additional official funds
would be needed beyond what i s envisaged in the program. Two main developments that
have contributed to lowering the pressure on the external sector as compared to earlier
projections have been larger than anticipated surpluses in the current account and less severe
capital outflows. The later has been mostly due to lower roll-over rates in the financial sector,
moderated nonresident outflows, as well as larger, but less than anticipated resident
accumulation o f foreign assets.

45.     The financing from the IMF and other partners will be re-phased till end 2011
(Table 5). The IMF supports the extension based on the substantial margin o f the N e t
International Reserves target for 2009 and further accumulation o f reserves expected in 2010.
Also, Nordic disbursements in the first and third quarters in 2010 are retained, but in smaller
amounts, while the remaining commitments are postponed for the first and third quarters o f
201 1. Official bilateral and multilateral resources represent about 47 percent (euro 4.2 billion) o f
the total financing needs in 2010-1 1 and as such are a key component o f the funding sources. To
date, 43 percent (euro 3.3 billion) o f the official financial support have already been disbursed.
The EU has affirmed that i t will continue to work closely with the Latvian authorities and
the Fund to ensure that Latvia implements successfully i t s economic reform program and i t s
timely repayment o f all loans associated with the international program to support Latvia.

46.    I n such improved circumstances, the public debt i s projected to increase less than
expected at the time o f the first Financial Sector DPL approved in September 2009 (see
Table 6). Gross public debt i s n o w projected to peak at 69 percent o f GDP in 201 1 compared to
90 percent in 2013 estimated at the First Review o f the SBA in August 2009.'4 While exceeding
the Maastricht threshold, the criterion can s t i l l be met if the debt i s on a downward path.15 Even
with sharper fiscal consolidation assumptions, public debt would only enter a gradual decline at
the beginning o f the next decade. l6

47.    Although gross external debt i s projected to remain high at around 180 percent o f
GDP in 2010, net external debt should reach i t s peak 58 percent o f GDP in 2009. Expected
successive current account surpluses will result in i t s steady decrease. The main source o f
medium-term risk will be the banking sector, which will remain a large external debtor with
gross debt estimated at 67 percent o f GDP in 2014 o f which 39 percent is short-term debt.




 l4 The difference between the Financial Sector DPL estimates and the ones projected during the Second Review o f the SBA i s
due to: (i) lower primary fiscal deficits, (ii)lower bank restructuring costs, (iii)lower interest payments, and (iii)updated
assumptions about deposit build-ups in the BoL.
 15
    The projection includes sizeable government deposits at the BoL. Excluding these deposits, public debt would be below
60 percent o f GDP.
 16
    Figures are based on sharp fiscal consolidation. Specifically, their path towards the Maastricht criterion involves sharp fiscal
consolidation in 2010 and 201 1 with the intent o f meeting the 3 percent target (ESA terms) by 2012. The authorities' proposed
fiscal consolidation path could put additional pressure on output but, if a faster-than-expected recovery were to materialize and
the fiscal adjusts more rapidly, then lower level o f debt-close to the debt Maastricht criterion-could be achievable by 2012.

48.     Stress tests highlight the high degree o f sensitivity o f the debt sustainability. Slower
deficit reduction (for example, due to reform fatigue) would result in government debt ratios
approaching 100 percent o f GDP. Also, more rapid and sustained deflation than envisaged under
the program would lead to higher government debt ratios (although smaller than during the last
review). Overall, the sustainability o f the public debt i s most dependent on the size of
the primary deficit, and the sustainability o f the external debt would be most affected by real
depreciation (see Figure 2). Public debt simulations are relatively less sensitive to a devaluation
and contingent liability or interest rate shock. The external debt i s less sensitive to shocks
originating in lower growth, higher interest rates, or a non interest rate current account shock.

49.    Overall, the current macroeconomic framework i s adequate for the Bank to proceed
with finalizing the proposed SDPL. Indeed, the macroeconomic outlook has improved
noticeably since the previous Bank loan was approved. The second review o f the SBA by the
Fund's Board i s scheduled on February 12, 2010. However, the proposed lending program s t i l l
remains subject to significant economic and political risks. Indeed, achieving real exchange rate
depreciation without nominal exchange rate depreciation will depend critically on continuing
strong domestic adjustment involving sustained wage correction and permanent fiscal
consolidation. Moreover, the current coalition remains fragile.. Parliamentary elections are
expected in early October 20 10, which will increase centrifugal pressures on the coalition
government. The current SDPL would also contribute to mitigating these risks as i t would
support the authorities finance safety net measures that should facilitate the medium-term
structural budgetary reforms. Supporting actions have been designed to increase transparency
and to hold the authorities accountable for implementation o f the package o f measures supported
b y the proposed operation.

2.3. SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE CRISIS AND ECONOMIC CONTRACTION'7

50.     The social impact o f the contraction has and will continue to be deep and
widespread. Bank staff simulations show Latvia i s likely to experience a sharp increase in
poverty, widening o f the poverty gap, and a rise in income inequality as a result o f the financial
crisis and economic contraction. Bank staff simulations show that the percentage o f people in
poverty will have increased from 14.4 in December 2008 to 20.2 a year later." In absolute
terms, there will be more than 130,000 additional poor people in Latvia than in 2008, taking the
total number o f poor people to more than 453,000. The poverty gap, which measures the poverty
deficit o f the entire population, will also increase from 5.9 to 8.3 percent. Finally, income
inequality - among the highest in the region prior to the crisis - will likely rise, with the Gini
coefficient increasing from 39.3 to 41.3 percent.

5 1.    Much o f the expected social impact o f the economic contraction can be traced to the
contraction o f the labor market. With an 18 percent contraction o f GDP in 2009, the sectors
most severely affected have been construction, manufacturing, retail trade; and the hotels and
restaurants sector. This has led to a loss o f more than 126,000 formal jobs, or 1 1.2 percent o f the
workforce. The large contraction in overall employment reflects employment contractions o f 19
percent in trade hotels and restaurants, 16 percent in construction, and 14 percent in
manufacturing. The largest increase in poverty i s observed in the poor region o f Latgale where
the majority o f employed people are likely to have been working in precarious, l o w wage jobs
even prior to the crisis. The impact o f the crisis i s also felt more sharply in households where a
man i s the primary income earner, which to a large extent i s explained by the contraction in the
mostly-male-employing construction sector. Households in which economically active members
have few skills (education levels o f high school or less) suffer relatively more. Finally,
households with children also suffer a greater impact.

52.     Having decided to pursue a strategy o f internal adjustment by retaining its
exchange rate peg to the Euro, the Government undertook a severe and rapid fiscal
consolidation in 2009, which has been met with stoic resolve by the public. Sharp cuts in
spending along with increased taxes and direct efforts to lower public sector wages have been
deployed to lower real wages and aggregate demand. In a small, open economy that was already
contracting in the wake o f the global financial and economic crisis, these adjustment measures
have wrought heavy social costs measured in higher unemployment, poverty and inequality.
Despite this, the political environment has remained remarkably stable. After street protests in
January and February, the resignation o f the Godmanis Administration on February 26, 2009,
and the instatement o f a new Dombrovskis Government, the public has been at least on the
surface resigned to the measures taken. Migration o f Latvians abroad, which accelerated after
accession to the EU in 2004, may have released some o f the social tension from widespread j o b
losses but raises concern for the loss o f skilled 1ab0r.l~ The fast growth o f the economy, with

I s A household i s in poverty if its total household income i s below LVL 90 per capita, or approximately US$6 per person per
day. In Latvia, this line i s known as the "needy" line.
    Migration o f Latvians abroad has become a topic that i s being increasingly discussed in the media as the rate of
unemployment rises. Anecdotal evidence shows that the composition o f migrants i s changing, from single,
working-age people, to families with children. This i s being interpreted in the public discourse as a likely shift in
the nature of migration toward longer stays or even permanent movement abroad. Although no official data exist to

real gains in GDP o f just under 10 percent per year from 2004 to 2007, means that even with the
sudden contraction o f 2008 and 2009, real GDP i s just back to the level o f 2006. The
Government's attempts to guide the process o f fiscal consolidation with needed structural
reforms and to provide emergency safety net support may also have helped to sustain a social
compact o f stoic support for the adjustment strategy it has chosen. Finally, local elections in
June 2009 and national elections planned for October 20 10 have and will provide opportunities
for the electorate to assess and weigh in on the situation. For example, in the June 6, 2009
election, more than half o f Riga City Council's 60 incumbents failed to win re-election. The
previous mayor's party failed to win any seats, and power shifted to a center-left coalition that
vowed to reduce the size o f the public administration to maintain spending on services.
Although social stability i s far from assured, these factors plus the apparent bottoming out o f
several economic indicators in the autumn o f 2009 and the implementation o f the emergency
social safety net beginning on October 1, give rise to hope that the calm in 2009 may continue.

2.4. SOCIAL SECTOR POLICY ISSUES

2.4(a) HeaJth
53.      The structure o f healthcare financing and provision raises costs, with little impact
on health outcomes that remain among the worst in the region. Compared to other Central
and Eastern European countries in 2007, Latvia had fallen behind in implementing i t s health
sector modernization plans. As a result, the Latvian health sector produced a relatively poor
level o f health outcomes at a significantly higher cost. Compared to more efficient health sectors,
Latvia has a greater number o f hospitals and hospitals beds; a high number o f outpatient clinics;
misallocation o f staff across facilities; and an overstaffed MoH and subordinated agencies.
Furthermore, the structure o f health financing creates incentives for provider-induced demand for
specialist and hospital care; and consequently, Latvia has high inpatient admission rates and long
average lengths o f hospital stays.




record international migration, data from the Embassy o f Latvia in the United Kingdom are indicative o f a
hypothesized sharp increase in migration as a result of the economic contraction. The United Kingdom and Ireland
are two destinations within the EU where Latvian nationals can freely move and legally take up employment. From
2004 to 2008, 76,000 Latvians were issued with social insurance registration numbers in Ireland and UK; almost 4
thousand per year have been registered as migrants in other countries o f European Economic Area. After peaking in
2005, the outflow from the Latvian labor force slowed down in 2006-2007, but intensified again with the onset o f
economic crisis in mid-2008 and especially in 2009. In the first half o f 2009 the number o f Latvians migrating to
the UK rose by 46.7 percent on the previous year. The number o f adult Latvian nationals registered in UK in the
first quarter o f 2009 (4.4 thous.) was much higher than in any o f the previous quarters since start o f registration in
2002. In 2009, the number o f Latvian nationals in the UK grew faster than the number registered in the UK's
Worker Registration Scheme, suggesting that the proportion o f migrant workers moving from Latvia with dependent
family members i s growing (M. Hazans , 2009. "Adjustment to the Crisis in the Latvian Labor Market" University
of Latvia, Department o f Economics and Management, mimeo prepared for this program).

54.    A widespread and inefficient hospital network has led to Latvia spending more on
inpatient care than other countries. As recent as 2008, 65 percent o f financing from the
National Health Fund was allocated for inpatient and emergency care. High spending o n services
has crowded out spending for capital and maintenance cost. Investments in high cost medical
technology and multiple and decentralized procurement o f pharmaceuticals are major cost
drivers in the system.

55.     The current provider payment structure creates adverse incentives that have
delayed the implementation of the health sector rationalization plan. Capitation to private
health care providers coupled with a reimbursement system for specialist and inpatient care that
i s for all practical purposes fee-for-service based, create incentives for general practitioners
(GPs) to refer patients to specialists and hospitals where they are kept longer. This situation i s
further exacerbated by calculating tariffs based on capacities instead o f unit costs o f the most
efficient providers. Even for households required to pay co-payments, the exemption o f
emergency care encourages patients to use costly emergency services to leapfrog their GPs and
gain direct access to hospitals and specialist care.

56.     Despite its extensive hospital network and Primary Health Care (PHC), relatively
poor health outcomes point to inefficient treatment. Latvia reports a relatively high
tuberculosis incidence and HIV/AIDS prevalence, a small proportion o f malignant tumors (0.8
percent) identified during preventive care examination indicating substandard quality, and a
burden o f diseases dominated by preventable and l i f e style diseases related to smoking, alcohol
and high blood pressure. Despite overcapacity in maternal and tuberculosis care, infant mortality
and tuberculosis incidence in Latvia are the highest in the region. These health outcomes point to
quality and efficiency issues in treatment patterns in prevention and PHC settings.

 57.    T o improve efficiency and quality in the health sector, the Government could play a
stronger stewardship role. A key to reform i s to advance the implementation o f the sector
rationalization plan and reduce the number o f hospitals, departments and beds to a level
comparable with other small countries and consistent with Latvia's changing population.
Further, analysis o f the productivity o f staff working in health facilities and a functional review
o f the MoH identified needs for downsizing numbers. Greater efficiency and improved
performance can be achieved by supporting rationalization o f hospital and beds with changes in
the provider payment and exemption policies, and selective contracting by the health insurance
fund.

 2.4(b) Education
58.     Latvia's education system i s characterized by high coverage but low efficiency.
Demographic change since the start o f the transition continues to lower efficiency. At the same
time, decentralization and diversification o f financing have led to greater inequality in learning
achievement across municipalities and schools. Competition in the global economy has changed
skill requirements in ways that make many education programs less relevant to today's labor-
market needs.

59.     The main driver o f inefficient spending in the education system i s the cost o f
teaching and non-teaching staff. Until reductions in 2009, education accounted for a relatively
high share o f government spending and GDP in Latvia because staffing/output ratios for both
teaching and non-teaching staff were among the highest in the region. This inefficiency i s a
legacy o f changes that occurred early in the transition. In Latvia, as in most o f the other
transition countries, GDP and public revenues f e l l sharply early in the 1990s. The Government
made a particular effort to protect education programs by allocating a greater share o f public
expenditures to the education sector. This preferential treatment persisted even after the fiscal
crises o f the 1990s passed. The overall education budget as a share o f total government
expenditures remained high by comparison to the OECD countries. The 2007 PER concluded
that education spending would continue to grow and education expenditures would remain high
unless budget financing for education was shifted from financing inputs (teachers) to financing
outputs (students).

60.     Changing the basis for education finance would yield major fiscal advantages,
allowing the education budget to adjust in proportion to the rapid decline in enrolments.
Between 1989 and 2004, the school-age population in Latvia fell by 28.6 percent.20As a result o f
this demographic contraction, enrolments in preschool, primary, and secondary education fell by
over 25 percent between 1990 and 2006. In the 2008/2009 academic year, the pupil-teacher ratio
was l o w and falling: 7.3 on average, down from 9.5 five years previously. At every level o f the
education system (primary, lower secondary, and up er secondary) the Latvian ratio i s among
the four lowest among the 12 new EU member states.' But education budgets did not fall as the
school-age population declined: education budgets financed teachers rather than students, so the
decline in enrolments did not trigger automatic reductions in staff. Indeed, there were (and
remain) strong pressures on the part o f communities and teacher unions to maintain teaching
positions even as enrolments fall.

   These national averages conceal significant variation across Latvia. Pupil-teacher ratio i s somewhat lower in Riga (8.2) than in
other big cities (8.9), but this i s consistent with higher proportion o f secondary pupils in Riga. Riga aside, the pupil-teacher ratios
in statistical regions (Pieriga, Kurzeme, Zemgale, Latgale and Vidzeme) range from 7.7 in Pieriga (where just one out o f six
pupils attends upper secondary school) to 7.2-7.4 i n Zemgale and Kurzeme (about 20% o f pupils are upper secondary ones) to 6.6
i n Latgale and 6.2 in Vidzeme (about 22% pupils are upper secondary).

61.      Spending on an inefficiently high number o f teaching staff reduces fiscal space to
raise the wages o f Latvia's underpaid teachers. Latvia's human resource inefficiencies in the
education sector stem from too many teachers being paid too little. Latvian teachers are
substantially underpaid, compared to their colleagues in other countries and with other
professionals in Latvia. Underpayment o f teachers was a problem even prior to the cuts required
this year. Statutory wages for teachers amounted to only 59 percent o f GDP per capita in 2008.
Even though nominal statutory wages doubled since 2005, as a portion o f per capita GDP, they
varied only slightly between 54 and 59 percent. By way o f comparison, only five countries in
the EU and OECD pay their teachers significantly less than 100 percent o f GDP per capita:
Hungary, Ireland and Norway (where teachers are paid between 66 and 80 percent o f per capita
GDP). Only Estonia pays teachers less than Latvia. Survey data capturing the total income
received by teachers - including income from overtime - raise the earnings indicator to 82
percent o f GDP in 2008. This i s s t i l l very l o w when compared to what professionals with similar
characteristics and qualifications are earning, particularly in the national public administration,
where salaries for comparable workers can be almost double that for teachers. This makes it
difficult to attract the best people to teaching.

62.     F u r t h e r efficiency can b e achieved by integrating and consolidating management o f
vocational schools at the municipal level. The management and financing o f primary
education, secondary general education and secondary vocational education (including the
secondary vocational programs currently managed by the MoES and other line ministries) could
be consolidated at the regional level. Currently, municipalities rightly consider vocational
schools outside their responsibility. Vocational schools could be seen as a community resource
subject to the same value for-money scrutiny as general education schools and other activities
managed by municipalities. If vocational schools are not providing the skills required by local
employers, municipalities could be free to close them or convert them to other uses. Secondary
vocational education programs have higher unit costs than secondary general education, but they
do not necessarily confer better prospects in the labor market. The decision about whether to
finance continuation o f existing vocational programs or whether to convert them to other uses
(including general education or vocational training in other areas) could be taken at the regional
level as part o f the ongoing reflection about how to maximize the efficiency o f the general
education network.

63.     T h e shift to "funds follow the student" financing, and loosening o f centrally imposed
guidelines for how budget allocations to education can b e used, could create strong
incentives for local governments to downsize the teacher workforce a n d retain the best
teachers. Municipalities will be free to reduce teacher needs by merging classes to create larger
classes, by increasing teaching loads, by combining grades into multi-grade classes, and by
bussing teachers to achieve fuller utilization. Schools could be combined in order to reduce
teacher needs and improve quality. Costs could also be reduced and relevance o f education to
local skill needs improved by changing the specializations offered in vocational schools and
providing stronger general education training to the students. To reduce differences in education
quality, the Government would need to strengthen centrally managed actions to monitor student
learning achievement in order to identify schools whose learning achievement falls below
national standards and to carry out educational interventions to bring schools with laggin
performance up to national standards. In i t s recent performance audit o f the education system29
the SA0 expressed concerns about the quality o f education and was critical o f MoES for not
establishing suitable mechanisms for monitoring the quality o f general education.

64.    At the university level, students are selected for budget-financed places purely on
the basis o f performance. Many students who qualify for budget-financed university places
would pursue the same courses even without a budget subsidy. At the same time, many low-
income students who do not qualify for budget-financed places are likely to be deterred by high
fees from pursuing higher education, despite the availability o f student loans. This raises
concerns about the potentially regressive outcome o f university subsidies.

2.4(c) Social Protectio~?~
        Latvia's social welfare system provides cash benefits categorized into three groups:
Social Insurance; State Social Benefits; and income-tested municipal Social Assistance25
(Table 7). State social insurance guarantees people who make contributions compensation for
the loss o f income (income smoothing) in certain situations - such as when a person reaches the
retirement age, becomes unemployed or disabled, loses their main income provider, becomes
sick, has an occupational accident or disease cannot, or takes o f f from work during the pre-natal
and post-natal (maternity) periods. People covered by social insurance (by virtue o f paying
contributions from their earnings) are entitled to the pensions, benefits and compensations to
ensure they can sustain their consumption when they are unable to receive an income due to the
circumstances discussed above. Social insurance in Latvia i s based on two fundamental
principles: (i) amount o f the social insurance payments are directly related to the earned-
                the
income on which the covered individual's social insurance contribution i s calculated; (ii)
financing i s on a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) basis by which the current social insurance benefits are
financed from the contributions o f working people. State social benefts complement the state
social insurance system and provide state support in the form o f cash payments to certain
population groups in vulnerable situations, due to reduction or loss o f income, such as: (i)
                                                                                            people
who are not covered by social insurance or whose insurance contribution record i s not sufficient
to receive social insurance benefits (state social maintenance benefit); and (ii) statutory cases
                                                                                  in
when additional expenditure i s needed but the state social insurance system does not envisage
any protection (e.g., the state family benefit, the child care benefit and the child birth benefit).
The right to receive the state social benefits does not depend on the social insurance
contributions paid. The state social benefit system comprises both, benefits paid on a regular
basis and lump-sum payments.

65.     I n contrast, most forms o f municipally administered social assistance i s designed to
target the poorest families, and awarded according to the results o f an income test. Housing
benefits and the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) transfers are the principal, mandatory
targeted social assistance benefits administered and financed by municipalities. Local authorities
also pay other social assistance benefits on a voluntary basis, as well as one-off, lump sum
emergency benefits to residents who have suffered shocks. Many o f these voluntary benefits and
the emergency benefits are not income tested.

66.    By EU standards, Latvia spends a modest sum on social protection. In 2007 Latvia
spent about 8.4 percent o f GDP on social protection. This i s well below Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia, Romania and even Estonia. Spending on social insurance
pensions makes up the largest share o f social welfare spending in Latvia as in all EU8 countries
- a product o f rapid ageing o f the population. Spending o n non-contributory transfers in Latvia
has been comparable to that o f i t s neighbors. However, spending on the targeted guaranteed
minimum income (GMI) benefit program - Latvia's "last resort" poverty benefit - i s about 0.2
percent o f GDP and has remained the lowest among the countries in Central Europe.

67.    Latvia was the first country in Central and Eastern Europe to restructure its public
pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) pension regime, from a purely defined benefit (DB) structure, to a
non-financial (notional) defined contribution (NDC) plan. The new public plan was implemented
in January 1996. Also as part o f the structural reform a separate pillar o f private mandatory
individual retirement savings accounts was introduced, and began operating in July 200 1.

68.     Although Latvia's pension reform was broadly considered a success, the pension
system remains vulnerable to even small changes in parameters. The retirement age which
reached 62 for men in 2003 and reached the same age for women in 2008, i s s t i l l very l o w by
international standards. In 2002, Latvian men could expect to live 13 more years and women to
live 20 more years on average after retirement. Since 1996, the unisex l i f e expectancy factor
tended to reduce the level o f benefits from the plan. The Government was concerned that rapid
changes in longevity as well as continued economic growth could lower the average pension
benefit relative to average wages. This concern motivated changes in indexing benefits to include
wage growth. From 2002 "Small pensions" (those equal to or less than 3 times the state social
maintenance benefit) have been adjusted by 50 percent o f wage growth in addition to the CPI


                                                              27
 adjustment. Benefits are adjusted to changes in inflation twice a year, and on the second
 adjustment, 50 percent o f growth in wages i s added. The generous indexation mechanism put in
jeopardy the fiscal stability brought by the 1996 reform, motivating the Government's move
 early in 2009 to shift to full inflation indexing. Pension indexation was frozen in 2009 and 2010.
Future pensions will be indexed only by inflation once a year.

69.     With economic decline, revenues to the social insurance special budget have fallen,
and the Government has introduced a temporary diversion of contributions from the
privately managed funded pillar, to sustain pensions paid from the public pillar. An
amendment to the law "On State Pensions" passed by Parliament on April 23, 2009 introduced a
time-bound diversion o f contributions from Latvia's private pension funds, to the N D C pillar.
From January 1, 2009, the contribution rate to the private pillar was reduced from 8 percent o f a
worker's salary to 2 percent. After 201 1, contributions to the private pillar remain at 6 percent.
Prior to the amendment, the contribution was to rise to 10 percent in 201 1. The Government
believes this temporary infusion i s necessary to (i) avoid deeper cuts to pensions in payment; and
(ii)eliminate the need for transfers to the social insurance budget from general revenues to make
up for the fall in contribution revenue as unemployment rises. The diversion enjoys political
support, however, it could be seen in future as a violation o f private property rights and will
weaken other financial contracts.

 70.      Although not a policy supported by the World Bank, the circumstances and nature
 of the diversion of contributions from the funded pillar to the NDC pillar lower the danger
 of reversal o f the 1996 pension reform. The IMF and E C take account o f the infusion o f funds
to the social insurance special budget from the diversion o f contributions from the funded pillar,
but do not recognize it as a revenue or savings measure in their assessment o f the Government's
fiscal performance. The diversion i s treated as "financing" (in that it increases future pension
liabilities), and i s shown as a separate line item in reports o f fiscal performance. The diversion i s
not a measure that any o f the program partners would have advised. In its current form, however,
the diversion has several features that limit i t s negative impact: (i) diversion o f contributions
                                                                           the
i s partial and temporary (which i s clearly spelled out in the amendment to the pension law), and
thus i s not a reversal o f the 1996 structural pension reform; (ii) diversion i s a measure taken
                                                                       the
within the parameters o f the multi-pillar model (not a break with that model); (iii) affiliate's
                                                                                          an
additional contribution to the public pillar i s recognized as such in the N D C formula, retaining
the "individualized" recognition o f contributions; and (iv) the amendment includes a clear "exit
strategy " reverting contributions to the funded pillar, although not to their originally envisioned
level. Furthermore, the diversion has to be considered in the context o f several other difficult
pension reforms that the World Bank has long been arguing for to increase fiscal sustainability,
which the Government took at about the same time, including most importantly, the repeal o f
wage-indexation o f pensions. In the second half o f the proposed program, the Bank team will
continue to work with the Government on further reforms to public pensions, and monitor
implementation o f plans to restore contributions to the fwnded pillar.

71.     Latvia's unemployment insurance plan has been the subject of critical scrutiny for
very low coverage and incentive problems. While the parameters by which the benefit i s
calculated, and the maximum period over which it i s paid, are similar to unemployment
insurance schemes in other countries o f the EUlO (although on the more generous side o f this
comparative scale given that benefits are calculated as a declining share o f average earnings in


                                                28
the j o b lost, as opposed to a declining percentage over the unemployment period o f a flat
amount), estimates made during the recent high-growth period show that the marginal effective
tax on re-employment i s much higher in Latvia, creating an unemployment trap. However, the
more pressing concern given the current dramatic contraction in the economy and sharp rise in
unemployment i s the l o w share o f newly unemployed at any given period that i s eligible for
benefits. In 2008 about half o f applicants for unemployment would be turned away because they
did not meet eligibility criteria.

72.     T u r n i n g to another branch o f social insurance, there has been a worrying increase
in the number o f recipients o f sickness benefits in recent years. Since 1997, the social
insurance budget finances benefits paid in the event o f sickness, maternity and paternity. Since
2001, the number o f social insurance benefits paid to cover sickness has been growing rapidly.
From 2003 to 2005 the number o f recipients o f sickness benefits grew by 32 percent, and was
accompanied by an increase in the average duration o f benefits. The rapid growth o f sickness
benefits i s a cause o f concern for the MOW, and may be indicative o f fraudulent gaming o f the
system. Across the region and elsewhere, sickness benefits are notoriously subject to moral
hazard and third-party-payer problems.

73.     Social insurance and state social benefits reach a majority o f the population.
Coverage and targeting performance indicators are presented in Annex 6, alongside comparative
spending and performance indicators from other countries in the region. Although spending on
social welfare cash benefits has been comparable to spending in Estonia and Lithuania and l o w
relative to spending in other EU8 and EU15 countries, social insurance and state social benefits
reach a large share o f the population (81.5%) and almost all o f the population in the poorest
quintile (99.1 %). N o t surprisingly, most o f the population receiving benefits in Latvia i s paid
state social benefits (mainly family state benefit). In contrast, social assistance paid by municipal
governments covers only 6.1 percent o f the population and 6.2 percent o f the poorest quintile.

74.    F o r Latvia's broad a r r a y o f non-contributory state social benefits, universal access
poses the m a i n risk to fiscal sustainability. Latvia like many countries in the region provides
universal state social benefits, and in particular family allowances. Family state benefits are by
far the largest o f the state social benefits, and are roughly evenly distributed across the
households o f different means (see Annex 6). Keeping family benefits universal i s a social
choice with explicit fiscal implications.26


26 The Government i s considering how to reform the state social benefit system to distribute spending on social
assistance more progressively. As part o f its dialogue with the World Bank, the M O W i s considering reforming the
largest o f its state social benefits, the Family State Benefit (FSB). I t i s important, however, that reform i s not
initiated during the current economic contraction. The Bank team's simulations show that if the FSB i s withdrawn,
the post-crisis poverty rate would jump from 20.4 percent to 22.8 percent in 2009. Survey evidence shows that
about L V L 83 million i s transferred to households in the form o f FSBs. Based on this, the Bank's simulations show
that if the FSB i s replaced by a top up cash transfer, all households with incomes below L V L 50 per capita per
month will qualify. Given that the "needy" poverty line i s L V L 90 per capita per month, replacing the FSBs with a
targeted income transfer that only tops up incomes to L V L 50 per capita per month will have no impact on the
poverty rate. However, the post-crisis poverty gap will decrease substantially from 8.3 to 6.9 percent. This post-
crisis poverty gap i s still marginally above the pre-crisis poverty of 5.9 percent, but represents a very positive impact
on the welfare o f the poorest households. Discussion o f how to reform the FSB will continue during discussion o f
the second proposed SDPL.

75.     Means-tested social assistance, financed and administered by municipal
governments, i s meager. Among the constellation o f non-contributory benefits offered by the
social welfare system, when compared to i t s neighbors, Latvia has the smallest share o f transfers
explicitly designed to target the poorest households. The meager spending on income-targeted
benefits i s apparent in the low coverage indicators (Annex 6), where the main benefit targeted to
the poor, the GMI, has to be grouped with other municipal benefits in order to be captured in
representative household surveys. In 2007 the GMI program was so scant that coverage and
targeting performance cannot be evaluated with survey data. The relatively small volume of last-
resort social assistance reaching poor households could reflect the highly decentralized character
o f Latvia's social assistance programs, which are not only administered but also financed by
municipal governments. This may explain the low incidence o f GMI if poorer municipalities are
less able to provide benefits. If benefits designed to be targeted to the poor are reaching only 17
percent o f households in the poorest quintile, this suggests that these particular programs may
either be under-funded by municipalities, and/or that there i s substantial leakage to non-poor
groups. Regional experience has demonstrated definite gains in targeting accuracy from giving
local governments certain roles and responsibilities in social assistance programs. However
where there has been greatest success, central governments retain responsibility for financing
minimum income guarantees, setting and enforcing targeting criteria, and conducting a quality
assurance role to verify and enforce both standards and efficiency.

 76.     Latvia's active employment assistance (active labor market programs, ALMPs) are
 organized and administered by the State Employment Agency (SEA), a subordinate body
o f the Ministry o f Welfare. All legal residents o f Latvia are eligible for active employment
assistance, as long as they are previously registered as unemployed with SEA. A broad range o f
ALMPs are provided, including vocational training, requalification and qualification
improvement; paid temporary work; activities targeted to the specific groups, such as youth,
disabled people, older workers and mothers reentering the labor market after maternity leave;
programs to help business start-ups and self-employment; and apprenticeship^.^^ Employment
provided through Latvia's ALMPs usually has to conform to labor legislation and pay at least the
legal minimum wage. The Government's budget allocations to ALMPs administered by the SEA
are boosted with financial support from the EU's European Social Fund (ESF). In the 2007 -
2013 EC budget planning period, LVL 154 million (EUR 219.7 million) was allocated to
activities in the social welfare sector (that is, under the domain o f the MOW), and 92 percent,of
this came from the ESF specifically. The majority o f ESF financing - LVL 129.5 million (81.5
percent) - i s allocated to ALMPs. The largest ALMP, by budget allocation, i s "promotion o f
employment in the regions" (LVL 34 million), which financed public works administered by
local authorities. This i s followed closely in budget size by training programs for job seekers
(LVL 33.6 million), administered by local offices o f the SEA.

2.5. POLICY ISSUES IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION

77.     Public administration in Latvia i s widely considered too costly and lacking in
transparency. Latvia's public administration has been criticized for unnecessarily high staffing
levels, salaries and unjustified expenditures on the one hand, and for deficient establishment
control over business activities and l o w quality on the other. Compensation o f state employees as
a percentage o f GDP has risen from 10 percent in 2000 to 12 percent in 2008 (i.e. from LVL 503
million in 2000 to LVL 1,947 million in 2008).** There are also governance problems, such as
opaque hiring and appointment processes for the management boards o f SOEs.

78.      These features undermine the public's confidence in the State. A well-functioning
human resource system i s imperative to a state-of-the art public administration. In the current
economic environment, however, with declining budgets, tighter fiscal space and staffing cuts, it
i s particularly crucial to maintain incentives and accountability within the civil service. A
further decline in the quality o f human resources in the civil service in Latvia will make it
especially difficult to establish a depoliticized and professional public administration in years to
come.

79.    The executive government system i s an overly complicated structure of ministries,
agencies, administrative entities, inspections units, and services. The current system o f civil
service management i s more centralized than international practice would advise. A large
number o f executive bodies have sprung up during a recent period o f rapid growth. While the
economy was rapidly growing and the state budget increased proportionally, the public
administration lost track o f cost efficiency. In the years o f economic boom public sector
agencies and SOEs paid little attention to the efficiency o f resource management.

80.      The current legal framework for management and governance of SOEs could result
in added opportunities for corruption. The law still allows SOEs to create subsidiary
companies which are not subjected to the restrictions and supervision procedures that the capital
companies themselves have to comply with. As a result, in individual state capital companies
there i s a complex and opaque network o f subsidiaries which create opportunities for the use o f
state resources in private interests and for evading public procurement. Another serious issue i s
the opaque selection o f SOEs management boards. This issue has been partly addressed by the
Saeima which imposed certain restrictions on the boards o f small and medium sized SOEs.
However, the members o f many SOE boards are s t i l l selected and remunerated in a non-
transparent manner. The current economic situation provides natural incentives to increase the
level o f accountability in the operations o f SOEs in order to reduce opportunities for corruption.

                     111. THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORM PROGRAM

3.1. FISCAL CONSOLIDATION

8 1.   The Government has passed budget consolidation measures that bring the deficit to
the IMF/EC program targets. On the 4th o f June 2009, Latvia's Parliament passed a second
supplementary budget for 2009. The Government's program yielded total savings in 2009 o f


 EUROSTAT Government Finance Statistics, Summary Table 2/2009.


                                               31
LVL 500 million, or 4 percent o f GDP. Additional revenue and spending measures in the 2010
budget are expected to yield a further LVL 500 million savings. Because, measures included in
the rapid fiscal consolidation would have had a regressive impact, the Government prepared at
the same time a set o f mitigating measures in an Emergency Social Safety N e t (see section 3.4).

 82.      Despite the severity and speed of adjustment, the Government i s trying to navigate
 the process o f fiscal consolidation with specific structural reform objectives. The Cabinet o f
 Ministers is committed to implementing fiscal consolidation through sound, structural reforms.
 In the social sectors, the most important measures are: in education, the introduction o f `ffunds
follow the student" per-capita financing in the 2009 academic year (which began in September
 2009), and the consolidation o f vocational schools under the management o f municipal
 governments; and in the health sector, a reduction in the number o f hospital beds, more effective
 use o f copayments to control demand for services, and reductions in excessive costs by shifting
 health care toward out-patient and hospital day-care procedures. Additionally, reforms have
 been passed that will increase the efficiency o f social protection by eliminating overlapping non-
 contributory benefits, improving the long-term financial sustainability o f old-age pensions and
 other forms o f social insurance, and increasing spending on targeted social assistance.
 Moreover, measures are planned to consolidate and professionalize public administration, by
 reducing the number o f central government ministries, improving human resource management,
 and increasing transparency in the management o f state owned enterprises (SOEs). This package
 o f measures will deliver fiscal savings required as part o f the program agreed with international
partners, as well as contribute to greater efficiency and efficacy o f social services and public
 administration in the medium term.

3.2. CRISIS-INDUCED EXPENDITURE CUTS AND STRUCTURAL REFORMS IN
THE SOCIAL SECTORS

3.2(a) Health
83.     I n the health sector, structural reforms delivering fiscal adjustment aim to improve
administrative capacity and transparency, and to rationalize the provision of care. Public
expenditure on health rose from 3.0 percent o f GDP in 2000 to a high o f 3.8 percent o f GDP in
2007. I t fell to 3.6 percent in 2008 - corresponding to LVL 576 million. The 2010 budget i s
predicated on a contribution equal to 3.6 percent o f GDP, or LVL 432 million, and i s expected to
                                                         ,*'
remain at 3.4 percent o f GDP through 20 11 The 25 percent cut from 2008 to 20 10 has put the
health budget back to where it was in approximately 2006 in real terms. The cuts took place
precipitously during 2009 as the M o H attempted to cope with the economic situation. The
Ministry's objective in trying to manage within this spending cap i s to restructure health services
fundamentally, in order to change the cost structure so that i t s lower level o f funding contributes
more effectively to improved population-based health outcomes.




*' draft budget for 2010 has a figure o f LVL398 million for health; the exact amount i s subject to change.

84.      The M o H i s protecting primary care, services f o r children and pregnant mothers,
emergency hospital services, subsidies for covered pharmaceuticals,and medical education.
To support these priorities it has cut financing for inpatient care, specialist services, high-cost
tests, and elective surgery. I t i s trying to substitute for inpatient services to the extent possible
through increased use o f outpatient surgery and alternatives to overnight hospital stays. I t has
raised patient copayments substantially. B y the mid-2009, the M o H was working with 56
percent o f i t s original 2009 budget. It maintained GP/PHC services at approximately 83 percent
o f the original allocation, only by cutting hospital and specialist services to about 43 percent of
the original amount. It w i l l continue at these much reduced levels in 2010 and 2011. The key
features o f the Government's structural reforms are:

             Streamlined MoH: The Government has substantially reorganized the Ministry and i t s
             affiliated agencies. Overall, there were 5,462 employees in the M o H and i t s agencies in
             January 2009. B y September 15, 2009 employment had been cut at the Ministry and i t s
             agencies from 1,038 to 570 employees (at the ministry alone - from 155 to 93
             emp~oees).~~
             Reductions in infrastructure: Within the budget envelope for 2010, public financing o f
             medical services w i l l be LVL 366 million, down from LVL 385 million in the
             supplemental budget o f June 2009.31 Key actions taken to maintain funding for i t s
             priorities include the following:

30 Overallspending on administration for the M o H and its agencies will fall from LVL32.1 million in 2009 based on the June
supplemental budget to LVL7.88 million i n 2010, based on the current budget proposal, a decline o f 53 percent.
31 In 2008 medical services were financed at LVL514 million; the total in 2010 i s 30 percent lower.



                                                                      33
                o Hospitals; Elimination o f 1,862 hospital beds by January 1, 2010. Based on a
                  stock o f 17,200 beds on January 1, 2009, this i s an 11 percent reduction. The
                  M o H plans to close another 1,335 hospital beds in 2010 and 3,23 1 beds in 201 1.
                  If it succeeds, it will have closed 37 percent o f i t s beds by the end o f 2011,
                  leaving 10,777 beds, or about 475 per 100,000 people (down from 757 in 2007).
                  Latvia had originally planned to meet this goal in 2015 although with little
                  prospect o f success given the political support for small municipal hospitals; the
                  crisis has increased the probability o f success and allowed the ministry to attempt
                  to reach the goal four years earlier than originally proposed. 32 33 Success in
                  reducing hospital infrastructure will allow Latvia to reallocate funds to primary
                  care, specialist outpatient services, pharmaceuticals, and public health activities.
                o Emergency Services: Maintain full coverage o f emergency medical services but
                  eliminate redundancies by creating a unified service out o f the 39 municipality-
                  based institutions that exist today. Merging these services will be completed by
                  July 1, 2010; i t includes careful reductions in the number o f hospitals providing
                  24-hour emergency services to minimize increased travel time.34
     0    Better use ofcopayments:"       There i s a cap o f LVL400 per year on the total copayments
          by a patient for all services, but this i s not automatic - the patient must apply for it. From
          the standpoint o f the public budget, the main benefit from increased copayments i s a
          reduction in use - which means the cost goes to zero for the insurer - but o f course it also
          benefits marginally by shifting more o f the cost to the patient when a service i s used.
          Effective February 1, 2009, with the first wave o f budget cuts, copayments were
          substantially increased across the board. The last increase in copayments had been in
          2005. B the end o f the first month, there were immediate decreases in use o f all
          services.76
          Reducing costs to the insurance agency: In M a y 2009 there was a second round o f cuts
          required to achieve LVL500 million in savings for the whole government in the 2009
          supplemental budget. The total amount to be cut from the health budget was about

32 When the reduction i s complete, Latvia will have about the same bed coverage as Poland, but still about a third more beds per
capita than the United Kingdom.
33 Many o f the closed beds would be programmed for different purposes, such as long term care or day surgery, but would not be
used for inpatient care. About 59 percent o f medical care spending in 2008 went to inpatient services and 35 percent to general
and specialist outpatient services. By 201 1 the MoH goal i s to equalize inpatient and outpatient spending at about 46 percent
each, which would still leave inpatient spending well above the OECD average o f about 34 percent. I n other words, while the
closure o f hospitals and reduction in beds i s severe, there i s such a large excess supply today that there will still be a need for
further adjustments after the crisis ends.
34 There i s considerable room for rationalization, as Latvia has triple the number o f hospitals per capita rendering
emergency services as do Hungary and Slovenia, for example, and five times the coverage in the Netherlands.
35 Copayments are collected by the provider and retained at the point o f service. Tariffs paid to providers for their services are
unchanged by copayments; they simply offset subsidies from the insurance fund.
36 Outpatients: The copayment for an outpatient visit to a family doctor was doubled to LVL1. Specialist copayments rose from
LVL2 to LVL5. Charges for diagnostic tests were raised as well, with the final cost ranging from LVL2 for a simple X-ray to
LVL25 for an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).
Inpatients: For inpatient visits, the cost to the patient more than doubled. Each day in the hospital now costs LVL12. Up to
LVL30 can be charged for surgery. There i s a cap o f LVL250 per event.
Other: Other reductions included specific changes that affected outlays by the insurance system, such as new rules on financing
consultations in hospitals, the maximum amount the insurance system would pay for endoprosthetic devices (such as hip
replacements), elimination o f inpatient payments for psychiatric patients who could be managed in social care facilities, shifting
cases to day beds, and so on.

          and 201 1. For a brief period in June, i t appeared that these cuts would be halved, but
          when the supplemental budget appeared, the original cuts were reinstated.
                o Exemptions: The M o H eliminated the long copayment exemption l i s t (ranging
                  from pregnant women to politically repressed persons to Chernobyl victims to TB
                  patients, and so on) and replacing it with an exemption for children under 18 and
                  for households certified as needy (see discussion o f ESSNS).
                o Negative List: Latvia does not have a "positive list" benefits package; rather, it
                  has a negative l i s t o f services not financed by the insurance system. A number of
                  services were put on the negative l i s t in the second round o f cuts to reduce or
                  eliminate the State                  Some "direct access specialist^"^^ are s t i l l covered,
                  and emergency services remain free to everyone.
                o Change i n medical practice to less expensive approaches. These changes include
                  the use o f less expensive antiretroviral drugs to treat AIDS patients, shifting
                  second stage rehabilitation to outpatient care, shifting radiation therapy and
                  cardiology services to a few central hospitals, and shifting chemotherapy and
                  other inpatient services to day services, as appropriate.
          Reducing volume: By far the largest single contributor to cost savings i s a reduction in
          the volume to be financed through contracts between the insurance agency and providers.
          A total o f LVL 103 million is to be saved in each o f 20 10 and 201 1.39

3.2(b) Education
85.    I n the education sector, structural reforms guiding the fiscal consolidation are
designed to achieve greater administrative efficiency. Expenditure reductions in the 2009
supplemental budget and sustained in 2010 and 201 1, through reduced spending and increased
teaching loads, reductions in teaching and non-teaching staff, consolidation o f institutions and
reduced outlays for materials, equipment and services.




'' These include high-cost, low-use services such as elective endoprosthetic devices (a further limitation beyond that in the
section on copayments above), positron emission tomography, and advanced diagnostics such as magnetic resonance imaging
(for which the copayment increased to 50 percent o f the cost). Specialist outpatient consultations were moved to the negative list
and into the private market. If the exempt have a prescription from a GP they would s t i l l be covered. Everyone else pays 100
percent o f the market price.
   Patients have direct access to specialists (without a prescription from their GP) for mental illness, TB, STIs, diabetes, cancer,
!?ecology,     child dentists, and for emergencies.
   For institutions, the volume reductions translate into reduced employment, capacity utilization, and so on. I t also creates the
opportunity to consolidate services, leading to the reductions in beds and excess capacity discussed above. The negative result
for patients i s that the public sector now finances only primary care and outpatient services, subsidized pharmaceuticals, medical
and dental services for those under 18, and emergency/acute inpatient care. People who are sick (or get sick), with either
physical or mental problems that can put them in a hospital, continue to get care. However, all elective inpatient services have
been stopped and specialist services for the average Latvian must be paid for directly.

86.    The cornerstone o f the Government's reforms in the sector i s the shift away from
financing inputs, toward a " j h d s foZZow the student", per-capita financing model at the
primary and secondary education levels, which i s complemented with the transfer o f greater
responsibility over the allocation o f education budgets to local authorities. The key features o f
the Government's education sector reforms are:

       Introduction o per-studentjinancing for primary and secondary schools, started in the
                      f
       2009 academic year (from September 2009), i s achieving the objectives o f budget
       savings, more efficient deployment o f teaching staff, and rationalization o f the school
       network. Latvia's education system has excess capacity o f school places and, especially,
       teachers. The problem o f overcapacity i s getting worse as the school-age population
       continues to shrink. The flexibility that comes through the per-student financing formula
       and lifting class-size and other constraints as part o f the reform provides an opportunity
       for municipalities to better manage their schools. However, flexibility under the new
       policy also poses a risk. Some municipalities may avoid the hard choices o f right-sizing
       and maintain existing schools and teachers, causing a sharp fall in teachers' earnings.
       Sustained declines in teacher earnings could threaten education outcomes by loss o f the
       most competent teachers, failure to attract competent teachers in the future, and reducing
       the motivation o f teachers who remain in the profession. There has been a major
       reduction in the total budget for teacher salaries in 2009 and 2010. In the first round o f
       implementation prior to the start o f the 2009 school year, municipalities have moved
       aggressively under the new policy to reduce the number o f teachers and consolidate
       classes and schools. These measures absorb much o f the excess capacity that
       characterized the system prior to the reform. In some cases, they may have gone too far,

         imposing strains on education delivery that could threaten education quality: Some urban
         governments report excessive class sizes and classroom crowding - especially, at the
         secondary level; some small localities - especially, those with minority-language
         instruction - report that they have few options for school and class consolidation and thus
         are finding it difficult to maintain programs with the resources that they receive under
         the new financing formula.
                  Reduced Teacher Numbers: The number o f full-time teacher positions in primary
                  and general secondary schools was reduced by 35 percent at the start o f the
                  2009/2010 school year, from 38,309 in the prior school year to 24,858. This very
                  sharp cutback led to a more-than 50 percent increase in the gross studendteacher
                  ratio4' -- from 6.2 in 2008/2009 to 9.5 in 2009/2010.
                  Rationalization o the school network: Compared with the start o f the 2008 school
                                   f
                  year, by September 1 2009, municipalities had closed 54 o f the 948 primary and
                  general secondary schools in the country and consolidated a much larger
                  percentage o f classes in primary and general secondary schools;41 eliminated
                  13,45 1 budget teacher ositions; dismissed 6,871 teachers; and reduced payments
                  for overtime teaching.4 r
                  Teacher earnings: Teacher earnings f e l l sharply in September, 2009 due to the
                  reduction o f the basic salary for a 21-hour workload from LVL 345 to LVL 255,
                  the reduced number o f paid overtime hours for teaching, and the suspension o f
                  payments for extra teaching-related work. These led to a 49 percent decline in
                  average teacher earnings - from LVL 552 per month to LVL 281 per month.43
                  Sustainability and mitigation measures: The sharp decline in teacher earnings
                  raises questions o f sustainability. For the immediate future, the MoES has
                  proposed and the Cabinet o f Ministers has agreed to mitigate risks to
                  sustainability by raising the value o f the transfer to municipalities for salaries by
                  37 percent starting January 1, 2010.44 Under the new financing system,
                  municipalities can choose how to allocate these funds. This action restores
                  funding available for teachers' salaries to i t s level at the start o f the 2008/2009
                  school year. In the medium term, MoES would like to further increase teachers'
                  base salary in the context o f a new full-time concept o f teaching in which teacher
                  compensation would be based on teaching outcomes (including student learning

40
   This figure i s based on full-time teachers, and includes teachers who are working at schools in non-teaching
functions.
41
   Statistics on the exact number of consolidated classes are currently being compiled from informationprovided by
local governments.
42
   Prior to the reform, teachers were paid on average 36 percent more than their base salary for overtime teaching
beyond the 2 1 lessons per week which comprise a standard teaching load. As o f September, 2009, average
payments for overtime teaching have been reduced to less than 10 percent o f base salary. Reducing the number of
hours of paid overtime teaching helped reduce the need for dismissing teachers.
43 These figures reflect the decline in payments to teachers from the state budget. Some local governments in urban
areas were able to reduce the impact o f this reduction by using local revenues to supplement teacher salaries and to
continue some payments for teaching-related work.
44
   Under the new policy o f decentralized school management with per-student financing, this will take the form o f a
37 percent increase in the per-student transfer to local governments for provision o f primary and general secondary
schooling.

       achievement) rather than teaching inputs (hours spent on teaching and various
       teaching-related tasks. The analytical and advisory assistance which i s to be
       provided under the Program w i l l help develop this new, output-based concept of
       the teaching profession.
Reorganization o vocational secondary schools. The Government i s implementing a
                  f
new policy o f scaling down vocational education while strengthening the schools that
remain in operation. I t i s moving towards consolidating management o f vocational
secondary and general secondary education which aims to bring vocational secondary
education under the same financing and management process under which municipalities
plan and deliver general secondary education. This change could help ensure that
decisions affecting the use o f vocational schools are subject to the same value-for-money
assessment that i s meant to guide municipalities' decisions in managing general
education schools.
   o   MoES has reorganized 9 vocational secondary schools, and reduced the level o f
       financing per student. The Ministry i s planning further changes which are
       designed to improve the efficiency and job relevance o f vocational education.
       Among these i s the conversion o f 14 vocational secondary schools into multi-
       purpose regional competence centers. However, more fundamental changes in the
       process for financing and managing vocational schools are needed in order to
       achieve longer-term improvements in cost-effectiveness and labor-market
       relevance o f vocational education programs.
More extensive use o means-testing in allocating university studentfinancing. Budget
                      f
outlays on higher education have been reduced by 50% -- from an actual budget
allocation o f LVL 8 1 million in 2008 and planned allocation o f LVL 83.9 million in 2009
to LVL 42.3 million for 2010. These savings have been achieved mainly through a sharp
reduction in financing per student university places - from LVL 3,124 in 2008 to LVL
 1,866 in 2009. The allocation per student will decline further in the 2010 budget, to
approximately LVL 1,500. As explained previously, many students who qualify for
budget-financed university places would pursue the same courses even without a budget
subsidy. At the same time, many low-income students who do not qualify for budget-
financed places are deterred by high fees from pursuing higher education. MoES i s
improving the equity o f spending on higher education by including household income
among the criteria for budget financed places and strengthening targeting o f scholarships
to low-income applicants.

   o The budget reductions to date have led to increased teaching loads, larger class
     sizes, and consolidated management across and within higher education
     institutions and higher education programs.
   o   To improve equity o f access to higher education, budget-financed places are now
       being awarded on the basis o f social need as well as student achievement. Means-
       based targeting o f scholarships i s being strengthened: 88% o f scholarships in
       Rezekne University and 50% o f scholarships in Daugavpils University this year
       were awarded on the basis o f low household income and other social criteria
       rather than performance.

 3.2(c) Social Protection
87.     I n social protection, the Government's structural reforms are designed to help
restore the long term financial solvency of social insurance and state social benefit
programs. Building on the achievement o f Latvia's structural pension reform in 1996, and
consolidating overlapping social insurance and state social benefits, reforms will help reverse the
rapid growth o f spending in recent years; and stabilize and reorient expenditure to prepare the
safety net to meet the increasing needs o f households in the wake o f the economic contraction.

 Notes: 1. For 2009 and 2010 data are budgeted amounts, rather than actual expenditure. 2. The large drop in State Social Benefit
   (SSB) spending in 2008 also reflects the transfer o f a benefit category to the State Social Insurance (SSI) budget - "parental
 benefits" paid to households making national insurance contributions were paid from the S S I budget starting in 2008. The same
              benefit category paid to households who do not make contributions, i s still paid from the SSB budget.

88.    To achieve the fiscal consolidation targets, the Government's key social protection
reforms are:

                Reduction o early retirement pensions from 80 to 50 percent o f the normal retirement
                           f
                pension benefit, effective 1 July 2009.
                Suspension o pension indexing in 2009 and 2010, and elimination o future wage-
                              f                                                        f
                indexing o pension benefits. In 2009, pensions were not indexed at all. In 2010
                           f
                indexation i s also frozen. After 2010 retirement benefits will be indexed to inflation
                only. MOWestimates reforming pension indexing saved LVL 13.5 million in 2009 and
                will generate considerable savings over a 20 year horizon.45
                Pension cuts. The 2009 supplemental budget cut old age and service pensions by 10
                percent and those o f working recipients by 70 percent. The pension benefit cuts are
                temporary, effective 1 July 2009 until 31 December 2012 and subject to review every 6

45 MOWprojections show indexation reform yields annual savings o f 0.2% o f GDP in 2010 and 201 1, which gradually increase
to 0.4% o f GDP in 2018 and to 0.7% o f GDP in 2030.


                                                                                                   39
         months. In December 2009, however, Latvia's Constitutional Court declared these cuts
         "unconstitutional". The Government i s planning to restore full payment o f pensions from
         1 February 20 10.46 47
         Temporary diversion o contributions from the funded pension pillar. From 2009 to
                                  f
         2010, the contribution rate to the funded pension pillar was reduced from 8 percent o f a
         worker's salary to 2 percent. In January 2011, the contribution will be raised to 4
         percent, and in January 2012 to 6 percent. After 201 1, contributions to the private pillar
         remain at 6 percent. Prior to the amendment, the contribution was to rise to 10
         percentage points in 2011. The Government believes this temporary infusion i s
         necessary to (i)  avoid cuts to pensions in payment; and (ii) eliminate the need for
                                                                        to
         transfers to the social insurance budget from general revenues to make up for the fall in
         contribution revenue as unemployment rises (see section 2.4(c)).
         Reduction in sickness and work injury benefits. The maximum period o f sickness and
         work injury benefit has been reduced from 52 to 26 weeks. M O Westimates the reduction
         in sickness benefits saved LVL 3.9 million in 2009 (with projected annual savings o f
         0.1% o f GDP to 2030) and that reduced work injury benefits saved LVL 0.04 million
         (with negligible further projected annual savings).
         Reduction in parental benefits o working parents by 50 percent in 2009 and
                                               f
         elimination o f these benefits for working parents for children born May 3, 2010 (from
         this date, benefits w i l l be limited to children unemployed parents). This measure
         effectively eliminates overlapping benefits paid as state social insurance and State Social
         Benefits (Le. the same need covered by both parts o f the system), and has led to savings
         o f LVL 2.85 million in 2009.
         Proposed increase o the retirement age, from the current 62, to 65, in annual increases
                               f
         o f 6 months, starting in January 2016. The M O W expects this increase to save 0.1
         percent o f GDP in 2016, for the savings to rise to 1.3 percent o f GDP in 2022, and then to
         stabilize at 0.5 percent o f GDP in 2030.48

   Prior to the court's ruling, Bank staff advised against the differentiated treatment o f pensions o f retired and
working people. The deeper cut in the pensions o f working recipients was unlikely to have the expected fiscal
 impact. There i s no good apriori rationale for treating the pensions o f working people differently from those o f
people who are economically inactive. Indeed, given the rate at which Latvia's population i s aging, and the
importance o f encouraging longer working lives, the measure would have imposed an economic cost. In the short
run, the differentiated cut in pensions creates strong incentives for older people to withdraw from the labor market
that could substantially reduce the savings expected from this measure. Experience from other countries suggests
that the labor market participation o f older workers i s precarious: once they withdraw they are slow to return. Many
could simply switch from formal to informal employment, reducing contribution revenue to the system.
Discouraging older people from working will be detrimental and raise the cost o f labor unnecessarily, particularly as
the economy starts to recover. Treating working pensioners differently i s also more likely to create a political
constituency to challenge the constitutionality o f the measure.
47 The Bank team's simulations showed that this cut would have raised the post-crisis poverty rate from 20.2 to 2 1.4
percent o f the population. I t also would have lead to a small increase in the poverty gap and the Gini coefficient.
However, a crucial assumption o f the simulation i s that active pension beneficiaries do not leave the labor force.
Given the large cut in the pensions o f working pensioners, the more likely outcome would have been that recipients
would leave the labor force to receive their full pension, albeit 10 percent less than before the policy change.
48 The Bank team and its program partners are discussing with M O Wwhether the starting date for the phased
retirement age increase can be brought forward. During preparation of the first loan in the proposed program, the

3.3. FISCAL CONSOLIDATION AND THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM
PROGRAM

89.     The Government's reform of public administration focuses on strengthening
information management, streamlining core activities, and improving the operational
efficiency and transparency of SOEs. The Government's objective is to consolidate functions
in order to arrive at a leaner public sector - possibly up to 30 percent smaller than today - as well
as to move toward a professional, de-politicized, motivated and integrated civil service. In the
past year, the Government has attempted to address high staffing, and by January 1, 2010, aims
to have a total number o f personnel in central government bodies less than or equal to the
corresponding numbers in central government offices o f Estonia and Lithuania. From the start o f
2010 the number o f staff employed in central offices o f government ministries will be reduced
by 30.37 percent as compared to July 1, 2008.

90.     The reforms so far however are mostly linked to the consolidation o f personnel
management, internal audit and accounting functions and tasks in the central offices. This has
led to a reduction o f expenditures (Le. improving the coherence o f programs), the reduction o f
the use o f different I T platforms, and reduction o f redundant and duplicative activities. The key
features o f the Government's reforms are:

    0    Civil service wage decreases. A first round o f wage reductions took place in January
         2009. Wages were reduced using a sliding scale: salaries below LVL 300 a month were
         cut 15 percent, and the reductions increased in percentage terms for higher paid staff
         corresponding to staff grades and levels.49 A second round was passed with the 2009
         supplemental budget in the summer o f 2009. Since August 2009 there has been a 34
         percent decrease in public sector remuneration and a 33 percent decrease in wages and
         salaries.
         Reduction in government agencies.           The Government i s also eliminating and
         redistributing administrative functions. Since the start o f 2009, there has been a 50
         percent reduction in the number o f agencies and a 30 percent reduction o f staff.50 To
         help inform the consolidation o f government agencies, a functional classification o f all
         administrative functions o f the budget has been developed, which lists the financial
         burden for each function in all budget institutions. The functions are also rated by state
                                                                                                  '
         institutions, unions and social partners and civil society on their r e l e ~ a n c e . ~During

World Bank's Pension Reform Options Simulation Toolkit has been calibrated to compare simulations with the
MOWmodel. This discussion will be central in preparation of the second loan, although the authorities have pointed
out the difficulty o f legislating a retirement age increase close to general elections in October 2010.
49 Regulation 955 on remuneration will be amended to reflect this change. This second round of public sector salary
cuts differs from the first round effective in January 2009, which was an overall decrease of 15 percent that budget
institutions received for wages. Which staff receivedthose cuts and at what levels was l e f t to the discretion o f
management of those institutions.
5o Structural changes include abolishing ministries' daily management o f particular entities (e.g. museums, schools,
sport facilities, libraries) while delegating daily management functions to local governments or other public bodies
(e.g. universities). Other structural measures include consolidating support functions by creating specialized service
centers for accounting, budget planning, internal audit, information and document management (as in Estonia), as
well as redistributing functions among ministries, reducing duplications and concentrating similar functions under
one ministry.

                                            f
          planning functions. M o F has taken measures to instill basic discipline in the budget
          regarding information availability and accessibility o f establishment control data (civil
          service numbers and statistics) and wages and rernunerati~n.'~ M o F is n o w collecting
                                                                            The
          this critical information on a monthly basis from state budget institutions, where
          previously the data were only collected once every six months. The Ministry manages
          both the civil service database as well as i t s own database on remuneration, and inputs
          information as it i s sent by budget institutions. A draft law (pending Cabinet o f Ministers
          approval)54 will mandate that the two databases administered by M o F be merged, and
          will require state budget institutions to input the information themselves on: (i)number o f
          employees; (ii)   remuneration; and (iii)    wages directly into the system which can be
          monitored by MoF.
          Curtailing discretionary salary arrangements. The Government has taken measures in
          the past year to address flexible salary allocations which were determined in a
          discretionary manner. So called "management contracts'' which were salary awards
          based on performance were initially introduced to retain qualified civil servants in the
          system, but ultimately were used on a discretionary basis and awarded by the head o f the
          institution, in many cases not linked at all to performance. Following a long-standing
          recommendation by international organizations the Government abolished these
          management contracts.

          Governments efforts include establishing criteria for the maximum remuneration for SOE
          management; establishing procedures to determine turnover, the balance and number o f
          SOE staff; establishing professional criteria and selection procedures for SOE board
          members, and initiating a review o f current board members against these criteria.


3.4. THE EMERGENCY SOCIAL SAFETY STRATEGY

91.     Underpinning structural reforms, the Government has passed an Emergency Social
Safety Net Strategy. This will ensure critical social services are maintained and the impact o f
the economic contraction on households i s cushioned as structural reforms are carried out. The
strategy finances and coordinates the efforts o f national and local government agencies to: (1)
maintain pre-primary education and child development programs for 5 and 6 year old children;
(2) cover the costs o f transporting students from communities where schools have closed to their
new places o f instruction; (3) exempt needy households from health service co-payments; and

52 The intention o f this approach is, to the extent possible, to depoliticize the process o f consolidation by providing as much
objective information and international benchmarking as possible. As an example o f the outcomes o f this process, the Ministry
o f Foreign Affairs considerably reduced its expenditures as it closed down several o f its embassies..
53
    Total remuneration for public administration workers includes monthly base wages/salaries, supplements and bonuses
according to the budget expenditure classification. Remuneration also includes employer taxes, state mandated social insurance
contributions, allowances, as well as compensation for health, life and accident insurance.

benefits administered by local governments. For the growing number o f unemployed who are
not covered by unemployment insurance or other social support, the Government has (8) fortified
the Emergency Social Safety Net by expanding and rapidly deploying labor-intensive emergency
public-works programs.

3.5. GOVERNMENT'S CONSULTATION

92.     The Government has made significant efforts to consult with stakeholders affected
by the fiscal consolidation, but more could be done to improve the public's understanding
of the need for reform. Each line minister has held discussions with stakeholder groups.
According to Latvian law, reform proposals have been published in draft online, and social
partners have been invited to participate in policy debates. Discussions between the teachers
unions and the Ministry o f Education and Science have been particularly heated, with unions
calling repeatedly for the resignation o f the Minister. The Prime Minister has required all
ministries to publish budget amendments on their web pages. The Bank team has accompanied
government consultations with non-government organizations representing constituents affected
by the fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. In addition to the teacher unions, the
Government has consulted with the Union o f Medical Professionals, the Hospital Owners
Association, and the Local Government Association.

93.     Consultation discussions have been difficult but frank, given the extraordinary
macroeconomic context in which social sector and public administration reforms are
taking place. There is broad understanding o f the circumstances that lead to Latvia's economic
contraction. However, there i s s t i l l widespread misinformation about the rationale behind and
objectives o f reforms. Each group i s insistent on minimizing the burden o f the fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms on their particular constituency. The Government and the
Bank team have explained the rationale behind and expected medium term benefits that will arise
from reforms. At the same time, the team has drawn valuable input on how best to target safety
net support to cushion the impact o f structural reforms o n vulnerable households.

94.     T o increase public information and transparency, the proposed operations include
key actions to publicize the activities and performance of the Government. For the first
operation in the program, a critical prior action i s that the Government publishes i t s Emergency
Social Safety Net Strategy on the internet and in the local media. This action i s key to help
increase the level o f public awareness o f the measures the Government i s taking to lower the
social costs o f fiscal consolidation and the economic crisis. For the proposed second operation,
the Bank task team i s partnering with the State Audit Office o f the Republic o f Latvia to conduct
an audit o f implementation o f structural reforms and the Emergency Social Safety N e t Strategy,
as a complement to the Bank's own program supervision responsibilities. As with all o f SAO's
reports, the audit report will also be published on the internet.

               IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

95.    This i s the first o f a proposed program of two SDPLs focused on Safety Net Support
and Social Sector Reform. The Bank program i s an integral part o f the international rescue
package o f the IMF, EC, EBRD, Nordic countries, and other lenders. The total rescue package
amounts to 7.5 billion, o f which the Bank's share i s 400 million. The Financial Sector loan
was for 200 million. The proposed first SDPL operation in the Safety N e t Support and Social
Sector Reform program represents 100 million. The second SDPL would be for the last 100
million o f World Bank support. The IMF operation was approved on December 23,2008 and the
EC operation on January 20, 2009. The Bank team has collaborated very closely with the Fund
and EC teams, and discussed complementarities and mutually supportive measures.

4.1. LINK TO COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

96.     Latvia joined the World Bank in 1992, and graduated from Bank financing in 2007.
As a borrowing member, i t received analytical and advisory support and loans totaling U S 4 1 6
million for 19 operations that have supported Government actions to implement structural
reforms, improve public finance management, modernize the welfare system and the health,
education, and infrastructure sectors, and reduce pollution in the Baltic Sea. The last Country
Assistance Strategy for 2002-2005 was launched during the period when Latvia's overriding
objective was to prepare for accession to the European Union-a goal which was achieved in
May 2004. The Government o f Latvia requested the Bank to support priority areas which were
not covered by the EU's acquis communautaire. As a result, the CAS focused on assisting
Latvia's efforts to improve productivity growth, public sector reform, development outside the
capital, and social sector reform. The six lending projects under this CAS closed with
satisfactory outcomes. Upon graduating from Bank financing, Latvia became a donor to the
International Development Agency (IDA) o f the World Bank Group during the 15th
replenishment o f IDA.

97.     Since graduation from the World Bank, Latvia has made full use o f the limited free
technical assistance and entered into a technical cooperation agreement on a fee-for-service
basis in the area of climate change. The Bank provided technical assistance to the Government
to help promote development in lagging rural regions, manage public finances strategically
through medium-term budgeting, and develop a public-private partnership framework. A t the
request o f the MoF, a Public Expenditure Review (PER) was conducted jointly with the IMF in
2007. The recommendations from this review are informing the social sector reforms being
undertaken by the government today, and technical assistance i s being provided to update the
PER to inform possible further measures in the second part o f the lending program. Finally,
under the fee for service agreement on climate change, the Bank supported the Ministry o f
Environment's efforts to implement a pilot greening program financed by revenues from
international emissions trading.

98.     The global financial crisis led to an exceptional request by the Government of
Latvia for renewed access to World Bank lending resources. The proposed program o f
operations i s consistent with the Bank's Articles o f Agreement. Pursuant to Article 111, Section 4
(ii), Bank may make loans to any member country, subject to Board approval, if"[it] is
     the
satisJied that in the prevailing market conditions the borrower would be unable otherwise to


                                               44
obtain the loan under conditions which in the opinion o the Bank are reasonable for the
                                                             f
borrower." In this case, the Bank i s satisfied that, in the prevailing market conditions, Latvia
would have been unable to otherwise borrow under reasonable terms, as confirmed by the very
high prevailing CDS rates for Latvia since the beginning o f the crisis. The crisis has exposed
underlying macro-vulnerabilities, and the deep economic contraction that followed l e f t Latvia
with significant borrowing needs and constrained access to external financing on reasonable
terms.

4.2. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

99.     Prior to graduating from World Bank borrowing, the Government of Latvia
maintained an active series of projects with the Bank. The proposed program draws heavily
from the Bank's earlier portfolio o f investment, technical assistance, and adjustment operations
as well as AAA. Structural reforms to social protection in the 1990s were supported with
resources from the Latvia Welfare Reform Project, which closed with a highly satisfactory rating
in 2003. The objective o f the project was to support the development o f a more efficient and
effective social welfare system. The Latvia Health Reform Project - approved in 1998 and which
closed in 2001 with a satisfactory outcome - supported Government implementation o f a health
services restructuring strategy. The Education Improvement Project helped to increase capacity
within the Latvian education sector for continuous improvement o f education outcomes by
strengthening the management o f both resource and inputs and the learning process. The project
was approved in 1999 and closed in 2004 with a satisfactory rating. Finally, an ongoing process
o f public sector modernization and improvements in service delivery in Latvia has been
supported with World Bank adjustment operations. In 2000 the first Programmatic Structural
Adjustment Loan and in 2002 the Second Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan, supported
reforms in the areas o f public sector management, human resources management, and
privatization and regulation o f public utilities, and private business, respectively.

 100. However, the investments made during this period failed to be fully exploited after
Latvia acceded to EU membership, leaving a legacy of pending reforms that has been taken
up in the proposed program. With World Bank assistance the Government invested heavily in
the design o f technically difficult reforms in the social sectors, the development o f strategies for
rationalizing service provision, and achieving greater efficiency in public administration. In
several cases, however, these plans were set aside during Latvia's years o f high growth, as the
fiscal constraint required to create a political consensus in favor o f their implementation was
loosened. A lesson that could be drawn from this experience is that continued engagement i s
important to sustain the Government's reform efforts, even when the relationship between Latvia
and the World Bank has moved beyond borrowing.

 101. As part o f the current international program of support for Latvia the Bank
approved a Financial Sector Development Policy Loan on September 22, 2009. The
Financial Sector DPL, which disbursed on November 4, 2009, supports a comprehensive
financial sector reform program, including: short t e r m measures aimed to contain the financial
sector crisis, and long term structural reforms aimed to enhance the resilience o f the system to
future potential shocks. The short term crisis management measures include measures to
strengthen the banking sector's solvency and liquidity, as well as measures to facilitate the
renegotiations o f corporate and mortgage debts with the objective to avoid the closure o f viable


                                                45
f i r m s and the foreclosure o f residential properties wherever possible. The long t e r m structural
reforms include strengthening critical banking sector regulations, including asset quality and
capital adequacy regulation, strengthening prudential supervision, especially through the
adoption o f a Prompt Remedial Action Plan by the supervisory authority, and conducting a
consumer protection review.

4.3. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

102. As rapidly growing macroeconomic imbalances began to become apparent, the
Government asked the IMF and World Bank to conduct a public expenditure review
(PER) in the summer of 2007, which has served as the analytical foundations of the
Government's program. The review examined public investment and outcomes in the social
sectors and public administration, and identified a number o f critical structural reforms. The
sector analytical background presented in this document draws heavily from the 2007 PER. The
report was discussed extensively in the Government during 2008. The MoF and the line
ministries have for the most part modeled their structural reforms on the recommendations o f the
2007 PER.

             V. THE PROPOSED SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

5.1. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES

 103. The Safety Net Support and Social Sector Reform Program focuses on measures to
mitigate the social cost of fiscal consolidation, ensure a robust safety net for households
affected by the crisis, and opportunities to improve public administration. This i s the first
o f a proposed program o f two loans focused on Safety N e t Support and medium term social
sector expenditure reform. The objectives o f the proposed program are: (i) protect vulnerable
                                                                               to
groups with emergency safety net support during the economic contraction; (ii) mitigate the
                                                                                     to
social costs o f fiscal consolidation; and (iii) ensure structural reforms lay a foundation for
                                                 to
medium term improvements in the social sectors. Given the deep impact Latvia has suffered in
the wake o f the global crisis, and due to the emergency nature o f this proposed program, the first
operation will focus mainly on the first and second objectives. The second operation will expand
this focus to the third objective.

104. The proposed operation will focus on measures designed to mitigate the social
impact of fiscal consolidation, and the implementation of the Government's cross sector
Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy. As structural reforms are implemented, the
Government i s also committed to alleviating the social costs o f the transition to new financing
and service delivery models in the education and health sectors, in order to ensure an adequate
level o f service provision i s maintained across the country. Moreover, in the context o f the
current economic contraction and high levels o f unemployment, this commitment extends to
strengthening the safety net to respond to the immediate needs o f vulnerable households. The
Government has developed and approved an Emergency Social Safety N e t Strategy (ESSNS) to
finance essential services and benefits delivered by national agencies, and locally by municipal
governments. The ESSNS came into legal effect on October 1,2009.




                                                46
 105. The Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy underpins fiscal consolidation and
structural reforms by deploying supplementary support to ensure basic social services are
maintained. The strategy finances and coordinates the efforts o f national and local government
agencies to: (1) maintain pre-primary education and child development programs for 5 and 6
year old children; (2) cover the costs o f transporting students from communities where schools
have closed to their new places o f instruction; (3) exempt needy households from health service
co-payments; and (4) subsidize their pharmaceutical costs; (5) sustain and improve general
practitioner (GP) and primary health care (PHC) services and access; (6) increase the coverage
and pay-out period o f unemployment insurance; and (7) increase the coverage and amount o f
targeted social assistance benefits administered by local governments. For the growing number
o f unemployed who are not covered by unemployment insurance or other social support, the
Government has (8) fortified the safety net by re-allocating financing from the European Social
Fund (ESF) to expand and rapidly deploy labor-intensive, emergency public-works programs.55

5.2. MEASURES SUPPORTED BY THE FIRST SDPL & INDICATIVE TRIGGERS FOR
THE SECOND (see Annex 2: Policy Matrix)

106. The Bank's program supports deployment of emergency safety net measures and
critical reforms to strengthen Latvia's social sectors. The first loan in the program i s
designed to ensure adequate emergency safety net financing for education and health services,
and social protection programs to mitigate the impact on households o f fiscal adjustment and the
economic contraction. The Government has taken specific actions to monitor the performance o f
national and local agencies as they implement the ESSNS to ensure the strategy is responding to
household needs. Furthermore, the program i s designed to increase public awareness,
transparency and accountability o f Government measures in the social sectors.

       The Borrower's Cabinet of Ministers approved an                           National and local government agencies are satisfactorily
       Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy for the period from                  implementing Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy
       October 1,2009 through December 31,2011 on September                      (according to details in each section below), maintaining
       8,2009 (Protocol No. 56,788).                                             adequate financing in 2010 and 201 1.

                                                                                 Regional Development and Local Government.
       The Borrower has provided adequate resources for and put in
       place a performance monitoring and impact evaluation plan,                An independent audit of the Government's performance in
       making use of existing monitoring mechanisms, administrative              implementingthe Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy

107. I n the health sector, the Government will strengthen GP and PHC services, provide
supplementary financial protection, and maintain services for needy households. The 30
percent reduction in spending for health services accomplished in one year and n o w expected to
persist for at least two more years allows Latvia to make needed structural changes in i t s


5s Being an ESF financed program, the new emergency public works must comply with certain legal requirements -
it needs to be implemented, monitored, audited and evaluated within the legal framework o f the Structural Funds
management - in accordance with Council Regulation No 1083/2006, Council Regulation No 1081/2006 and the
Commission ImplementingRegulation N o 1828/2006.


                                                                47
spending. But the policy response to this precipitous decline in public funding has put
households at greater risk financially and - with access to care more problematic - at greater risk
to health as well. Latvia already in 2005 had the highest out-of-pocket spending in the EU, with
39 percent o f health spending coming directly from households. In developing i t s safety net
program, the M o H sought to attenuate both types o f risk for the most vulnerable while at the
same time using the safety net program to support needed medium t e r m structural changes in i t s
budget. For the MoH, these programs add back approximately L V L 2 4 million (out o f LVLISO
cut from 2008 spending) focused primarily on needy households. The key prior actions for the
first loan, and triggers for the second loan are:

      households with per-capita income less than half the
      minimum wage, at adequate levels, to finance: (a) an
      exemption from co-payments for general practitioner,
      outpatient, specialist, and inpatient services; (b) an
      exemption from pharmaceutical charges above LVL 50 per
      year per person; and (e) an exemption from the cost of
      overnight hotel stays in hospitals, home care for those with
      serious diseases and day-care centers for those with mental
      diseases.




 108. I n the education sector, the operation will support measures to sustain critical
services as the new per-capita financing model i s implemented. The main elements o f the
ESSNS in the sector are the safeguarding o f financing for pre-primary programs for 5 and 6 year
old children. International evidence consistently shows that pre-school education performs a
vital role in improving the learning opportunities for children at risk. The Government's
decision in 2005 to make preschool education free and mandatory for five-and-six-year-old
children was a positive development in terms o f long-term learning outcomes. The mandatory
pre-primary program has strong effect in equalizing preschool attendance across income groups.
Analysis suggests that the subsidy o f pre-school provision has had a strong impact across the
country and across income groups that could otherwise be at risk. Further, the proposed lending
operation supports the provision o f transportation subsidies for students who need to travel to a
new place o f instruction due to the consolidation o f the school network, and protection for
means-based aid to university students. The key prior actions for the first loan, and triggers for
the second loan are:




                                                               48

             The Borrower allocated i n the 2010 budget funds to cover             In the 201 1 budget, the Borrower has allocated adequate
             the cost of transportation of students whose schools have             financing to cover the cost of transporting students whose
             closed to replacement schools                                         schools have closed to replacement schools.

             The Borrower added into the Regulation of the Cabinet
             of Ministers No. 740, dated August 24,2004 social
             considerations, in addition to merit, to the awarding of
             state support to students i n higher education by issuing a
             Regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers No.511 dated June
             2, 2009.56



 109. I n social protection, the operation w i l l support reforms to increase coverage o f
social assistance, and better target spending to the most vulnerable households. Early in
2009, the Government extended the pay-out period o f unemployment insurance benefits, and
adjusted eligibility criteria to ensure that a larger portion o f workers at risk o f losing jobs were
covered by the social insurance system. For the unemployed not covered by unemployment
insurance, the Government has reallocated ESF financing to support emergency public works
programs, designed to be self targeting (see box on the Workplaces with Stipend public works
program). Furthermore, the Government increased the level o f the GMI, raising the size o f
benefits paid and the number o f vulnerable households who can receive benefits. To ensure that
local governments have sufficient resources to cover the rising demand for targeted social
assistance benefits, the Government put in place financing guarantees to supplement municipal
spending on GMI. In the second phase o f the operation, most o f the measures supported in the
social protection sector, will ensure that the needs o f poorer households continue to be met, and
that resources are available to deploy additional assistance for people suffering losses from the
economic contraction. Further measures are planned to strengthen contributory and non-
contributory social protection in the longer term..        Key prior actions for each phase o f the
Bank's support are:

             The Borrower enacted an amendment to the Law "On                      The contribution rate to the funded pension pillar has been

          Box 1. Latvia's New Workplaces with Stipend (WWS) Emergency Public Works Program
            The design and roll-out o f the new Workplaces with'stipend (WWS) public works program has been
  impressive. The design meets or exceeds international best practice for income support programs with a work
 requirement. Individuals who have lost their job but are not covered by unemployment insurance are eligible to
 apply. Each of Latvia's regions i s assigned a specific number of program places according to the number of
 likely unemployed not covered by unemployment insurance in that region.
            Participants have to work full time, are employed in labor-intensivetasks, and receive a monthly
 stipend o f L V L 100, 5 5 percent o f the legal minimum wage. A low benefit rate has been shown internationally
 to achieve the goal o f "self targeting", i.e. attracting low skilled unemployed people, which makes the programs
 more effective at reaching those who need support the most and are able to work. Further, by requiring daily,
 full-time commitment to work, the program keeps participants active without impinging their incentives to
 continue looking for employment. Finally, market employers respond positively to the discipline and
 responsibility demonstrated by an individual's past participation in this sort o f program.
            At the start o f November 2009, there were more than 16,000 work places registered in the SEASand
 almost 14,000 people were participating in the WWS. The target o f 17,000 WWS participants for 2009 i s very
 likely to be reached. Furthermore, municipalities expect the number of work places to increase in the spring,
 summer and autumn of 20 10. Although not a firm estimate, it i s expected that a further 10,000 work places can
 be created by municipalities under the existing guidelines of the program in 2010 bringing the total number of
 work places to 27,000, which would mean spending all the resources currently allocated to the program from
 the ESF. Notably, about 10 percent of those who entered the program have already left for other job
 placements. About 2400 unemployed people who sought to join the program turned down the opportunity to
 participate. This could be evidence that the "self targeting" features o f the program are working.
           The program has been over-subscribed. About 26,000 people are waiting for workplaces. But as time
 passes and both the national and local authorities get practice at implementingthe program, the cues will
 diminish. Local governments have been sharing experiences o f the type of work they have managed to create
 that fits within the rules o f the current design, particularly as the onset o f winter limits the type o f labor
 intensive work that can be created.
           However, controversies continue over allowing municipal-owned agencies and businesses to take
 advantage of the free labor supplied by this program. Allowing state and municipal-owned enterprises to take
 in WWS participants would create strong budget incentives for these employers to dismiss workers to whom
 they pay the minimum wage. If the program automatically wilts as economic conditions improve - both
 because workers abandon it for better jobs and because no constituency has been built up to try to keep the free
 labor - this will be a mark of success. If hospitals or municipalities lobby to keep the program because they
 need the work done, then they will have failed in designing the program only to complete one-off activities that
 are not needed for everyday operation o f an existing program. This program i s adequately funded for 2010 in
 the ESSNS.
         For the longer term, the Government i s carrying out an important reform of ALMPs by increasing
 competition among training providers and the quality o f training received by introducing vouchers into the
 employment training program.

5.1. ANALYTICAL AND ADVISORY ASSISTANCE

110.     The proposed lending program i s accompanied with technical assistance to the
Government in social sector and public administration reform. The Bank has limited
technical assistance resources, which are being deployed according to the following strategic
priorities (in order): to provide the technical input needed (i) design and implement their
                                                                   to
ESSNS; (ii)to monitor and (where appropriate) evaluate the impact o f ESSNS measures; and
(iii) evaluate the state o f the public expenditure program in 20 10 in light o f the extraordinary
     to
adjustments that have taken place in 2009 and to assist the Government in making strategic
decisions as further adjustments will be required in 20 10 and 20 11.

111. Consistent with the strategic priorities above, a program o f analytical work will be
conducted by the World Bank team that could identify further structural reforms.
Technical assistance during the preparation o f the proposed first SDPL has focused o n design
and implementation o f the ESSNS. In the interim between the two lending operations, the Bank
task team will continue to provide technical assistance to help the Government monitor and
evaluate i t s safety net response, and to update the 2007 PER o f the social sector and public
administration. This investment o f technical assistance could identify further structural measures
to improve efficiency and efficacy for possible inclusion in the second policy loan.

6.1. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

d.l(a) Impact o f the economic contraction
112.    Latvia will experience a sharp increase in poverty, widening o f the poverty gap, and
a rise in income inequality as a result o f the financial crisis and economic contraction. In
order to motivate urgent formulation o f an Emergency Social Safety N e t Strategy, the Bank team
conducted simulation anal sis o f the likely increase in unemployment and poverty in the wake o f
the economic contraction,' Starting from the expected 18 percent contraction in GDP (affecting
mainly trade, hotels and restaurants, construction and manufacturing) and 11.2 percent
contraction o f employment (concentrated in the same sectors) the percentage o f people in
poverty will increase from 14.4 to 20.2.60 61 In absolute terms, there will be more than 130,000
additional poor people in Latvia than in 2008, taking the total number o f poor people to more
than 453,000. The poverty gap, which measures the poverty deficit o f the entire population, will
also increase from 5.9 to 8.3 percent. Finally, income inequality - among the highest in the
region prior to the crisis - will rise, with the Gini coefficient increasing from 39.3 to 41.3
percent.

113. There are substantial differences in the impact o f the contraction across regions and
specific population groups. Bank staff simulations show that the largest increase in poverty i s
observed in the poor region o f Latgale where the majority o f employed people are likely to have
been working in precarious, l o w wage jobs even prior to the crisis. The impact o f the crisis i s
also felt more sharply in households where a man i s the primary income earner, which to a large
extent i s explained by the contraction in the mostly-male-employing construction sector.
Households in which economically active members have few skills (education levels o f high
school or less) suffer relatively more. Finally, households with children also suffer a greater
impact.




59 Analysis of the distributional impact of the economic crisis on households in Latvia was based on household survey data
(Latvian EU-SILC 2006 database) and focused on the impact o f the growth slowdown through labor markets. The impacts
quantified are direct short-run impacts, and hence they do not take into account the general equilibrium effects.
6o A household i s in poverty if i t s total household income i s below L V L 90 per capita, or approximately US$6 per person per
day. In Latvia, this line i s known as the "needy" line.
6' Since the mid 1990s, Latvia has not used an absolute poverty line, and since accession to the EU, use of the Leaken measure of
poverty (households at or below 60% o f median income) has become widespread. However, only two income thresholds have
policy consequences: the "needy" threshold, used in the simulation, entitles households in some municipalities to supplementary
social assistance and - since passage o f the Government's ESSNS - total exemption from health copayments; the guaranteed
minimum income line entitles households across the country to the Guaranteed Minimum Income supplement and more recently
to housing benefits.

62(b) Poverty and social impacts o f ESSNS measures
114. Bank staff simulations indicate that the measures supported by the proposed SDPL
will mitigate the worsening effects from the global economic crisis on poor and vulnerable
people. Despite the adverse external factors surrounding this operation, the policies supported
by the proposed SSDPL have been designed to protect the funding o f basic needs and services
for l o w income segments o f the population and to boost expenditure on programs targeted to
people affected by the crisis. Bank staff concludes that the components o f the ESSNS will
mitigate the impacts o f the crisis for poor and vulnerable people and that no adverse
distributional impacts are likely. The simulations for poverty and social impacts these measures
are summarized below.63

 115. Simulation I: Increasing the eligibility threshold at which GMI is provided. This
reform has two impacts. First, it will lead to higher coverage and second it will lead to higher
transfer to poor households and in doing so, lower the poverty gap. At the end o f 2007, the GMI
threshold was LVL 28 per person per month. However, at the beginning on 2008, the threshold
was increased to LVL 37 per person per month and then in October, 2009 the threshold was
increased again to LVL 40. If targeting were perfect, then the increase in the threshold will lead
to 21,000 new GMI beneficiaries. Because the GMI eligibility threshold i s s t i l l below the
"needy" poverty line the team has used for these simulations (90 LVL per capita per month,
approximately equivalent to the Leaken measure), there will be no change in the poverty rate.
However, with the decrease in the poverty gap there i s a reduction in household deprivation.

 1 16. Simulation 2: Increasing household incomes o unemployed people either through
                                                            f
augmented unemployment benefits or the provision o public works. Unemployed people are
                                                          f
disproportionately represented among the poor in Latvia. Improving their welfare without
affecting incentives to seek regular work i s crucial. In this regard, the Government has taken 2
steps. First, the Government increased the duration during which unemployment benefits are
paid to 9 months, where a payment o f 45 LVL (a quarter o f the minimum wage) i s made for
either 3 or 6 months depending on whether the unemployed person receives unemployment
insurance benefits for 6 or 3 months respectively. Second, the Government began a public works
program that pays 100 LVL per month (the minimum wage i s 180 LVL per month) to
participants. Both o f these measures increase the incomes o f households. In the aftermath o f the
crisis, if no unemployment benefits are paid, poverty rises dramatically to 23.1 percent. Under
the 2008 rules o f the unemployment insurance plan, the typical newly unemployed person
received a benefit o f about 28 percent o f hidher pre-layoff income. With no changes to the plan,
the expected poverty in the wake o f the contraction i s 20.2 as reported above. However, if that
amount o f the average post job-loss benefit were to increase to 40 or 50 percent (either through
the more generous parameters passed early in 2009, or with the stipend from public works), then
aggregate poverty in the wake o f the contraction i s reduced to 19.1 or 18.1 percent, respectively.
Neither o f the measures i s likely to have a significant impact on incentives to rejoin the formal
labor force when the labor market starts to recover, because the unemployment benefit top-up i s
l o w and because the public works stipend i s lower than the minimum wage.

 117. Measures included in the ESSNS, supported by the proposed SDPL, are likely to
have longer term, positive social impact, particularly the protection o f financing for pre-
primary education for 5 and 6 year old children. International evidence consistently shows
that pre-school education performs a vital role in improving learning opportunities for children
from low-income and poor households. The Government's decision in 2005 to make preschool
education free and mandatory for five-and-six-year-old children was a positive development in
terms o f long-term learning outcomes. Evidence suggests that the implicit subsidy o f
Government provided, mandatory pre-primary programs has had a strong impact across the
country and across income groups. In the figure below the l e f t panel shows that the program has
had a fairly strong effect in equalizing preschool attendance across income groups. The poorest
fifth (Ql) approximately matches the richest fifth (Q5) in attendance. The right panel shows that
attendance i s distributed across the country, with Riga barely matching i t s share o f the
population with preschool attendance. These data suggest that the program o f public subsidies i s
raising preschool attendance. The economic literature suggests that these programs have a strong
impact on the later success o f children in school. In the absence of today's earmarked subsidy

for this program, some municipalities - the richer ones - will certainly be able to continue
financing it, but poorer children and poorer localities will have great difficulty maintaining
participation.

 118. The health sector measures included in the ESSNS will substantially lower
household financial vulnerability to the cost of treatment, and encourage wider-spread
access to health care. The closure o f hospital beds and medical facilities increases health risks
and the burden on primary care services, which will be under pressure by patients to solve more
problems for households. In addition, with more people in poverty and losing employment,
medical care will become less accessible financially. However, each person in Latvia has a
family doctor, and funding has been protected for this service. By adding funding in the ESSNS
package for an additional public health nurse (with specific responsibility to lengthen operating
hours and ensure that all patients receive preventive care and screenings and see their GP at least
once during the year) the Government will ameliorate the stress that will be put on health
outcomes and demonstrate a commitment to the part o f the health system that people will use
regularly. This short-term investment through the ESSNS puts the M O H in the position over the
longer t e r m to continue strengthening primary care by absorbing these costs in i t s regular budget
when the economy begins to expand again.

119. Needy households are exempt from copayments, which will lower the burden of out
of pocket payments substantially. Beginning October 1, 2009, this exemption was put into
effect. Instead o f having to pay first, and then apply for a partial refund from the municipal
social assistance office, anyone in Latvia certified as needy can now go to her family doctor and
receive care free o f charge, with the insurance system paying the copayment. With referrals
from their GP, other services are treated in the same way. In addition, pharmaceutical charges
for covered drugs will be financed fully once the patient has paid LVL12.5 each quarter (or
L V L 5 0 for the year, whichever happens first). This measure i s a complement to the previous one
- trying to get the needy households in particular to use their GPs - and will shift i t s exemption
policy ultimately to a means-testing approach in place o f the current "social group" approach.


                                                      56
The measure i s likely to eliminate variations across localities in assistance and creates an
incentive for the poor to seek care - exactly what i s needed if the health system i s to contribute to
better outcomes.

 120. Needy households will continue to receive the care they need in health facilities, free
of charge. The chronic poor in modern economies i s a group heavily populated by those who
suffer physical or mental disabilities that put them in need o f long-term care and support o f the
state. An effort to manage the care o f these patients outside an institutionalized setting, as Latvia
plans to do through this policy shift, thus directly benefits one o f the poorest segments o f the
population. However, a sudden shift away from inpatient services for these patients creates risks
that they will be prematurely removed from institutions; that alternative services will not be
developed in a timely manner; and that the public and the medical establishment will oppose new
approaches because they are introduced recklessly. Shifts to home and day care must happen
now, though, because the funding i s simply not available to follow existing antiquated and
uneconomic inpatient-based practices. This element o f the ESSNS allows the M o H to target new
services to needy clients and to assure that the severely constrained resources for inpatient care
are available for people who really need to be treated on an inpatient basis. This i s a first step in
a long-term plan to de-institutionalize people who, because o f the historical legacy, continue to
be in residential care when they would be better o f f more integrated into normal social settings.

6.3. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

 121. The specific policies supported by the proposed development policy loan are not
likely to have significant effects on Latvia's environment, forests, and other natural
resources. Unanticipated and unintended risks o f adverse effects to the environment and natural
resources are likely to be minor. Latvia has adequate environmental controls in place. Latvia's
environmental legislation and regulation i s reinforced by EU environmental directives, including
the EU's guidelines on adoption o f environmental assessments at the planning and programming
level (June 2001) and the EU's Environmental Liabilities Directive setting out liability for
damage to properties and natural resources (April 2007).

6.4. IMPLEMENTATION MONITORING AND EVALUATION

122. The Bank will work closely with the MoF and sector Ministries to monitor and
assess reform progress and impacts during the course of the program. Monitoring o f
implementation and evaluation where possible will be supported by the various Ministries as
well as budgetary, legislative and economic data provided by the authorities and verified in
official disclosures, directives and regulations. The Ministry o f Regional Development and
Local Government (MoRDLG) has formal responsibility for monitoring implementation o f the
ESSNS, and for submitting regular reports to the Cabinet o f Ministers on progress. Baseline and
updated data are provided by the respective specialized agencies for the pertinent functions and
tracked according to the indicators and outcome measures as shown in the Monitoring and
Results Framework (see Annex 3).

123. The State Audit Office o f the Republic o f Latvia (SAO) may choose to evaluate the
government's performance in implementing the emergency social safety net supported by
the proposed loan. The State Audit Office reports independently to Parliament and i s a key


                                                57
institution for public sector accountability. Given the complex nature o f structural reforms and
emergency assistance supported by the proposed program o f development policy lending, the
Bank team has continuously shared information with the State Audit Office to encourage an
interest by it in monitoring the Government's performance. If it decides to audit this program, i t s
findings will be included the Bank's dialogue with the Government.

6.5. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

65(a) Public Financial Management System and Budgetary Resources
 124. The most recent World Bank diagnostic work was conducted in 2007 and focused on
selected sectors of public expenditure. Latvia joined the European Union in 2004 and
graduated from World Bank financial assistance in 2007. As such, the most recent diagnosis was
the 2007 PER. This analytical work was complemented for the purpose o f this development
policy loan with ongoing monitoring by the World Bank o f Public Financial Management (PFM)
reforms and previous diagnostic work conducted by other external organizations.

125. Overall, the Latvian PFM system i s supported by a well established legal and
institutional framework. Over the recent years Latvia has introduced a series o f PFM reforms
and enhancements. The most significant reforms were the phased introduction o f program and
performance based budgeting, a medium term expenditure framework, capacity building at the
State Audit Office, and implementation o f the web based IT system supporting budget planning
and execution. These reforms have resulted in a stronger PFM system characterized by
centralized cash management within a single treasury account structure, a web-based on line
reporting system updated twice per month, timely preparation and audit o f government financial
statements and strong audit capacity at the State Audit Office (supported by private sector sworn
auditors) involved in auditing the Bank o f Latvia and local governments.

 126. I n spite of these major accomplishments, there are a few areas where further
improvement i s needed. These include: the budgetary framework exposed to economic
downturn due to lack o f clear procedures on budget cuts, insufficient implementation o f
medium-term planning and performance budgeting (in practice performance indicators focus on
outputs rather than outcomes, budget execution i s s t i l l monitored on the basis o f budget
appropriations, there i s tendency to use incremental budgeting), inadequate budgetary
expenditures monitoring and enforcement especially at the local government level, deficiencies
in accounting at the ministerial and local government level resulting in negative audit opinions,
fragmentation o f the budget into "base" and "special" (earmarked for special purposes) budgets,
insufficient accountability framework o f the sector ministries related to the overall performance
o f the sector (including also quality o f the delivery o f the services by the local governments).



127. Based on the above status o f PFM in Latvia, the fiduciary risk associated with the
proposed program of operations i s low.

6.5(6) Foreign ExchangeEnvironment
128. The Bank of Latvia (BoL) i s a member of the European System of Central Banks,
and its legal independence i s granted by the Law on the Bank of Latvia. The main objective

                                               58
o f the Bank o f Latvia i s maintaining price stability in Latvia and the primary tasks include
management o f foreign currency and gold reserves. The B o L acts also as advisor to the
Parliament and the Government with regard to the monetary policy, following ECB practice. The
B o L does not engage in any commercial activity, and i t s operations related to the execution o f i t s
tasks are mainly financed from income from the management o f foreign currency and gold
reserves. The Parliament has supervisory role over the BoL.

129. The IMF completed a Safeguards Assessment of the BoL in July 2009 and the
World Bank reviewed external audit reports of the central bank. The B o L financial
management and operations are transparently disclosed and presented on its website. The B o L
annual financial statements are regularly audited by the audit commission, whose members are
approved by the Auditor General o f the Republic o f Latvia, and the most recent audit reports, for
2006-08 have unqualified audit opinions.

6.6. DISBURSEMENT, AUDITING AND PROCUREMENT

 130. The proposed lending program will follow the World Bank's disbursement
procedures for development policy lending. Loan proceeds from the first operation in the
proposed program will be disbursed in one tranche to the foreign currency account at the BoL.
Disbursement will be made upon Borrower meeting prior actions and declaration o f loan
effectiveness and submission o f a withdrawal application to the IBRD. At the request o f the
MoF, the IBRD will deposit the proceeds o f the loan into the deposit account at the B o L which
forms part o f the country's official foreign exchange reserves. The Borrower shall ensure that
upon the deposit o f the Loan into said account, an equivalent amount i s credited in local
currency64 to the Single Treasury Account also kept in the B o L and that i s available to finance
budgeted expenditures. Disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases, thus no
procurement requirements will be necessary. The Government shall maintain accounts and
records with respect to the deposit o f loan proceeds in the BoL. If the loan proceeds are used for
ineligible purposes as defined in the loan agreement, IBRD will require the Borrower to refund
the amount directly to IBRD

 13 1. N o additional fiduciary arrangements will be required. The Bank will not require an
audit o f the deposit account, but will require the Government to provide a confirmation to the
Bank in the form o f an official letter from the Ministry o f Finance on the amounts deposited in
the foreign currency account and credited to the budget management system (Single Treasury
Account) within 30 days o f receiving the funds.

                                     VII. R I S K S AND RISK MITIGATION


132. Risks to the proposed program of lending are high. Risks arise mainly from an
ongoing and sharp economic contraction and the size o f the needed fiscal adjustment Latvia has
committed itself to make.



64TheBank can also agree that the proceeds o f the loan will remain in loan currency (EUR), which should be reflected in the final
version o f the project document.


                                                             59
133. Further, unexpected economic contraction could reduce tax revenues, requiring
further fiscal adjustment. The IMF and E C led program was based on assumptions that the
economy would only contract by 5 percent in 2009 but GDP i s estimated to have contracted by
18 percent. Although the fiscal outlook has become more stable, considerable uncertainty
remains.

  134. T h e program faces considerable macroeconomic risks that lower the likelihood of a
 quick recovery. The Government is undertaking a very ambitious economic adjustment
 program based on a macroeconomic strategy that includes severe fiscal consolidation measures
 and wage cuts under the fixed exchange rate regime. The severity o f the measures may make
 them difficult to implement. Also, the much higher government deficits will make it harder to
 meet the Maastricht criteria and may delay the program's exit strategy o f Euro adoption.
 Deflation may be even deeper than currently projected, which could also jeopardize Euro
 adoption. However, the economy may also recover faster than expected if global growth
 resumes faster. These risks are mitigated by the size o f the multilateral financial package,
 equivalent to 35 percent o f GDP, in support o f the Government's program. In addition, the
 support o f Latvia's international partners, particularly the EU, represents a key safeguard to the
 program. The EU's commitment o f 3.1 billion under the international support package has
 provided space for implementation o f the programmed reforms. I n a July 27 press statement
 announcing their disbursement o 1.2 billion, the E U afirmed that it will continue to work
                                    f
 closely with the Latvian authorities and the IMF to ensure Latvia implements successfully its
 economic reform program and repays in a timely manner all loans associated with the
 international program to support Latvia. Thus, while the risks are significant, continued current
 account surpluses, Latvia 's strong commitment to the program, expected improvements in global
financing conditions, and E U support provide safeguards.

 135. T h e ESSNS may not b e sufficient to address the social costs inflicted by the speed o f
fiscal adjustment and structural reforms. The fiscal adjustment Latvia undertook in the
second half o f 2009 and i s committed to undertake in 2010 and 201 1 i s substantial and would be
difficult even in a non-recession environment. The sheer size and speed o f the adjustment raises
the risks o f adverse impact on households. O f particular concern i s the structure o f means tested
minimum income assistance - the most decentralized in the E C A region. Decentralized
provision o f social assistance, particularly in the context o f the extraordinary economic
contraction, can lead to gaps in the safety net across municipalities o f different wealth. A key
part o the Government's ESSNS is to provide contingent financing for the GMI, as well as to
       f
raise the income threshold for households to qualifi for assistance. These measures, as well as
the deployment o the new Workplaces with Stipend public works program, can help to contain
                    f
social costs. I n dialogue with the Bank team the Government agreed to expand the ESSNS
package to include strengthening GP/PHC services with public health nurses. Implementation
and adequacy o ESSNS measures is being monitored on regular basis. Should the ESSNS
                  f
allocations in the 2010 budget prove inadequate, the Government could consider a further
temporary extension o unemployment insurance: a larger deployment o emergency public
                        f                                                      f
works: and increasing the co-financing o GMI. Program partners have agreed to provide
                                           f
leeway in fiscal adjustment targets to accommodate additional safety net measures.

136. T h e difficulty o f structural reforms during a period o f severe and prolonged
economic recession could trigger a backlash o r reversion to past practices. The Government


                                               60
 will need to continue explaining why structural reforms are necessary and h o w these measures
 will lead to improvements in the medium term. This has proven to be a difficult task in 2008 and
 2009 as conditions continued to worsen. Even early in the IMF-led program, there were violent
 protests against the first changes to the 2009 budget. Although the bottoming out o f Latvia's
 economic decline has lowered resistance and there i s widespread stoic acceptance o f the
 measures the Government i s taking, more can be done to increase information and public
 awareness. The Bank team supports a proactive effort by the Government to explain the needfor
fiscal adjustment and the rationale for reform, having participated in several instances, in key
 discussions with social partners. The Bank team has engaged local communications experts to
 help clariJL the role o the institutions in the overall international assistance effort. The Bank
                        f
 encouraged and assisted in the development o the emergency social safety net to mitigate some
                                                 f
 o the negative impacts o the JiscaI consolidation and economic crisis, and supported the
  f                          f
 Government's strategy to be widely publicized.

 137. Budget reductions o f this speed and breadth are unprecedented in most countries, and the
success o f structural reforms depends on the quality o f implementation in a very difficult
political climate. Success requires difficult decisions to be made at the local level, as general
elections grow nearer. The Bank w i l l remain engaged through this two-loan program to monitor
how structural reforms are being implemented in the education and health sectors, to inform the
ongoing process o rationalization, and to adjust the content o the proposed lending program as
                  f                                           f
implementation issues arise.

 Dear Mr. Zoeflick,

 During 2000-2007 the economy of the Republic of Latvia experienced one of
 the fastest rates of growth in Europe, which led to a s h q improvemat in
 living standard!, but has been accompanied by rising imbalances. Growth,
 which averaged 9 percent between 2000-2007, was mainly driven by private
 consumption and investment in real estate and other ncan-tradable sectors,
 Rapid public expmditwc gmwth added to demand and overbeating during this
 period, while wage growth above praductivity improvements exerted upward
 pr~.essure consumer price inflation and eroded the national competitjveness.

 The international financial crisis h s further affected the stability o f the
 national eoonomy. The availabiiity af external finance has fallen sharply, due
 to global dcvefopmcnts wd downgrades to the sovereign credit rating o f the

50% co-financing o f municipal resources spent for the G M bcncfits; however,
local governments should finance from their resources the remaining 50% of

Scrcial safety net activith in the health domain

Prior to October 1,2009 patients who had bcm p n t c d thc nccdy person status
{ccrtificatioti isvucd by Ihe lwd g o v m m t ) paid 50% ofpatient payment for
health care. Therefore, needy persons had limited access tu health care s m i c e s
due to financial reasons. Introduction of patient payment compensation
mccchanisms made it possible for pcrwns who have bcen granted Ihe needy
person status to receive n i x e s v health care. Within the scope o f expanded

will be used for solving o f the c h i l h n transportation issue. At the same time,
the purchase of busses for school children transportation is foreseen also in the
Strategy taking into account thdt the transportation issue using Swiss financial
assislance will be solved partly. It should be noted that allacated financing
within the Strategy could b re-distributed from purchase o f busses to covering
                            e
of subsidies for transportation or ticket compensation in cases subsidies for
transpanattion are mare advmtageous than the purchase of busses.

       ANNEX 5: LATVIA'S MULTI-PILLAR RETIREMENT SECURITY SYSTEM

 1.     Latvia was the first country in Central and Eastern Europe to restructure its public
pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) pension regime, from a purely defined benefit (DB) structure, to a
non-financial (notional) defined contribution (NDC) plan. The new public plan was implemented
in January 1996. Although not funded, the benefits paid under a non-financial N D C retirement
savings plan are calculated based on an affiliated worker's accumulation o f "notional" capital
(the individually accounted accumulation o f contributions to the lan) and a notional rate o f
return, which in Latvia's case i s tied to the contribution wage          Simultaneously, a phased
increase in the minimum retirement age for men and women was introduced, which converged at
62 in 2008. One o f the merits o f an N D C structure - like a funded defined contribution plan - i s
that by tying benefits to contributions, it provides workers with an incentive to work longer,
since their benefits are linked to how much they "accumulate" and the returns earned on their
notional capital. Thus workers are able, and indeed encouraged, to work and contribute past the
minimum retirement age as upon retiring, a worker's notional annuity i s calculated by dividing
his notional capital by his remaining l i f e expectancy.

2.      Also as part of the structural reform o f social insurance for old age, disability and
survivor coverage in the 1990s, a separate pillar o f private mandatory individual
retirement savings accounts was introduced, and began operating in July 2001. The new
funded accounts were made mandatory for any worker under 30 at that time, and all new entrants
to the formal labor force. Since 2001 a small share o f workers' social insurance contributions to
the N D C plan (about 2 percentage points) has been diverted to the individual retirement
accounts. This share has been increasing slowly (in 2008, it was equal to 8 percentage points).

3.      Latvia's structural pension reform was considered a success from the perspective of
an affiliated individual and his household. Estimates o f gross replacement rates (Table AS. 1)
and net replacement rates (Table A.5.2)"' indicate that a Latvian worker o f average earnings
who participates in the system could expect a higher retirement benefit than a similar worker in
Estonia and Lithuania, and even in Poland. The expected benefit from the Latvian system was
actually higher than the regional average. And unlike other mixed-plan systems in the region
and elsewhere in the world, in Latvia, a worker can choose to add his financial savings to his
notional savings upon retiring in order to increase his benefit from the N D C plan, or purchase a
private annuity.




`loThus, the rate o f return earned during the accumulation period (when a worker i s paying into the plan) reflects (a)
growth in productivity and the wage rate; (b) changes in fertility; (c) the net migration o f working age individuals;
and (d) the gradual formalization o f the economy.
   N e t replacement rates take into account the taxes and social security contributions that individuals
have t o pay while working but also in retirement.

4.     Although Latvia's pension reform was broadly considered a success, the pension
system remains vulnerable to even small changes in parameters. Latvia's pension reform
brought long t e r m financial stability to the old age, survivor and disability programs o f the social
insurance system (Palmer, et al, 2006). However, this financial stability was fragile and
vulnerable to even small changes in the parameters o f the plan (such as the contribution rate,
indexation mechanism, and the minimum age o f retirement) and how contributions to and rights
acquired under the pre-reform plan are recognized. l2              *

`I2 The method o f calculation o f a worker's notional annuity has two important fiscal policy implications. Upon
retiring, a worker's notional annuity i s calculated by dividing his notional capital by his remaining l i f e expectancy.
There are two important points to note with this estimation, which both have potential fiscal consequences. First, a
unisex estimate i s made which overestimates the remaining expected years o f l i f e for men and underestimates the
remaining lifespan of women. Second, the l i f e expectancy estimate i s made annually for each cohort of retirees from
the plan, and as such captures the longevity gains reflected in population ageing.


                                                          82
5.       Due to rising unisex life expectancy factor used to calculate NDC annuity and the
resulting gradual reduction o f benefits there was a move toward indexing benefits to wage
growth. The retirement age which reached 62 for men in 2003 and reached the same age for
women in 2008, but i s s t i l l very low by international standards. In 2002, Latvian men could
expect to live 13 more years and women to live 20 more years on average after retirement. Since
 1996, the unisex l i f e expectancy factor used to calculate the N D C annuity has increased from
 18.25 years to 19.17 years in 2004, which tended to reduce the level o f benefits from the plan.
The Government was concerned that rapid changes in longevity as well as continued economic
growth could lower the average pension benefit relative to average wages. This concern
motivated changes in indexing benefits to include wage growth. Until 2002, indexation o f
benefits was based solely on the consumer price index (CPI). From 2002 "Small pensions"
(those equal to or less than 3 times the state social benefit) have been adjusted by 50 percent o f
wage growth in addition to the CPI adjustment. Benefits are adjusted to changes in inflation
twice a year, and on the second adjustment, 50% o f growth in wages i s added. The Government
planned to extend this wage adjustment in addition to the CPI to all pension benefits (old age,
survivor and disability benefits) in 2O15.ll3 According to the new policies indexation o f pensions
has frozen in 2009 and 2010 and further pensions w i l l be indexed by pure CPI.

6.     The generous indexation mechanism put in jeopardy the fiscal stability brought by
the 1996 reform. During the period o f high wage growth from 2004 - 2007 the mixed indexing
regime put at risk the fiscal stability brought by the 1996 reform, particularly given the growing
share o f funds going to private individual accounts. The 2007 PER concluded that significant
medium and long-term savings for the social insurance special budget would arise from
abandoning the policy o f adjusting benefits to wage growth.

7.       With economic decline, revenues to the social insurance special budget have fallen,
and the Government has introduced a temporary diversion o f contributions from the
privately managed funded pillar, to sustain pensions paid from the public pillar. In the first
half o f 2009, as the economy contracted, revenue to the social insurance special budget declined
sharply. An amendment to the law "On State Pensions" passed by Parliament on April 23, 2009
introduced a time- bound diversion o f contributions from Latvia's private pension funds, to the
N D C pillar. From 2009 to 2010, the contribution rate to the private pillar was reduced from 8
percent o f a worker's salary to 2 percent. In January 201 1, the contribution w i l l be raised to 4
percentage points, and in January 2012 to 6 percent. After 201 1, contributions to the private
pillar remain at 6 percent. Prior to the amendment, the contribution was to rise to 10 percentage
points in 201 1. The Government believes this temporary infusion i s necessary to (i)          avoid
cutting pensions in payment; and (ii) eliminate the need for transfers to the social insurance
                                        to

 `I3The Government sought to avoid a sharp decline in pension benefits relative to the wages o f the working
population during sustained period o f high economic growth, to prevent pensions from looking meager relative to
wages, thereby avoiding a political back-lash and lead to calls for even more populous measures. However, from a
purely economic perspective, the mixed indexation i s excessive. The adjustment to a contributor's notional capital
during working l i f e i s sufficient to help him smooth consumption (the first function o f any old-age income security
system), and adequately captures his contribution to the economy and whatever externalities that arise from that
contribution. Further underpinning this growth in notional capital, i s the security o f the safety net benefit to keep
him out o f poverty (the second function), and the diversified returns earned from the private investment o f savings in
a worker's funded individual account. In most PAYGO pension plans like Latvia's NDC, although the salary base
from which the annuity i s calculated i s indexed to wage growth, once an affiliate retires, benefits are usually only
indexed to inflation, or to a combination o f inflation and wage growth.

budget from general revenues to make up for the fall in contribution revenue as unemployment
rises. The diversion enjoys political support. However, it could be seen in future as a violation
of private property rights and will weaken other financial contracts.

8.      Although extreme, the Government's action i s a change within the parameters of
the multi-pillar pension model, and with the right measures, the damage to the system can
be mitigated. In assessing the amendment, it is important to note the N D C structure o f Latvia's
pay-as-you-go pillar. Strictly speaking, these additional contributions to the public pillar will
add to participants' "notional capital" accumulation and translate into higher pensions when
currently working affiliates retire. The amendment requires that the N D C rules be applied to the
diverted contributions. Assuming that public administration i s as good a custodial service as
private administration, then the loss to the affiliate at the time they retire, i s the difference
between the N D C notional rate o f return (which is currently negative) and the financial rate o f
return had these savings been invested in securities (which i s also negative). From an affiliated
workers' perspective, the difference depends on the extent to which the risk to the rights acquired
by workers under the N D C rules o f the public pillar are greatedless than the property rights o f
holding financial assets (mostly publicly issued debt). However, the infusion from this measure
relies on the same source o f revenues - worker contributions - and so i s also vulnerable to
increasing unemployment. It also increases the future liabilities o f the social insurance special
budget, raising the risk to the financial sustainability o f public pension provision.

9.      An additional weakness o f the NDC plan which threatened the long-term financial
stability of publicly financed pensions even before the crisis i s the lack of a pension reserve
fund. Outside observers have been calling for such a fund to safeguard the PAYGO structure o f
the N D C plan since i t s inception. While pensions are financed out o f a special social insurance
budget that accounts for workers' contributions (as well as the government's responsibilities to
pensioners under the pre-reform regime), any surpluses are simply deposited in a special account
at the Treasury, and are not earning as high nor as diversified a return as they would if they were
invested on the international capital market. This i s a problem, as prior to the crisis Latvia was
enjoying a demographic yield from a surge in childbirth in the 1 9 8 0 ~ ~ the annual surpluses
                                                                              and
from additional worker contributions were not being used optimally to help underpin the N D C
plan's long t e r m finances. Without a reserve fund, the risks o f the financial stability o f the public
pension scheme were growing even before the downturn.
