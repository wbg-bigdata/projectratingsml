F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The objectives of the DPL series were to: (i) protect vulnerable groups with emergency
safety net support during the economic contraction; (ii) mitigate the social costs of fiscal
consolidation; and (iii) ensure that structural reforms lay a foundation for medium-term
improvements in the social sectors.

Given the deep impact Latvia has suffered in the wake of the global crisis, and due to the
emergency nature of this program, the first operation focused mainly on the first and
second objectives. The second operation expanded this focus to the third objective,
seeking to support the structural reform program that the Latvian Government put in
place for the social sectors.

  The target was initially to provide additional public health nurses only for rural GPs, but with
amendments to regulations No. 1046 on August 3, 2010, it became possible to also extend extra public
health nurses also to urban GPs. In total, there were 1,376 rural and urban GPs at end-2011.

                                      Executive Summary

After graduating from World Bank financing in 2007, Latvia exceptionally requested renewed
access to lending resources in 2009 to deal with the impacts of a severe economic crisis. An
important component of the World Bank’s support was a SDPL series of two operations that
supported policy actions related to protecting the most vulnerable, within the framework of a
structural reform program that underpinned the fiscal adjustment in education and health. The
performance of these two operations is reviewed in this document.

A critical area of focus was the implementation of an Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy
(ESSNS) to finance essential services and benefits. The ESSNS was designed not only to protect
the poorest and those that had lost their jobs from the crisis, but also to mitigate the adverse
impacts of the cuts in government spending. Measures included the maintenance of resources for
pre-primary education; transportation of children from closed schools to their new schools;
coverage of health services and pharmaceuticals for poor households; improved services and
access to GP and primary health care services; increased coverage and pay-out period for
unemployment insurance; and increased coverage and adequacy of targeted social assistance
benefits. The ESSNS also put in place an emergency public works program designed to provide
support for individuals who had lost their job, but were not eligible for unemployment insurance
benefits.
The SDPL series also assisted the Government to ensure that fiscal adjustment in the social
sectors was underpinned by a longer-term structural reform agenda. In education, the government
embarked on a ―funds follow the student‖ financing reform in the education sector to increase
efficiency and education quality in light of the shrinking school-age population. The switch to
this form of financing creates incentives to increase the low teacher-pupil ratio in Latvia and
decrease school infrastructure. In the health sector, reforms aimed at improving administrative
capacity, while substituting expensive inpatient services to the extent possible through increased
use of outpatient surgery and alternatives to overnight hospital stays. Primary health care services
were protected.

The overall rating of performance is satisfactory for both SDPL operations. This rating reflects
the high relevance of the development objective, the design, and the progress with regard to
implementation and the achievement of the program objective. All planned policy actions were
implemented, although one measure was postponed by one year and another one was reversed by
the Constitutional Court. The operation was well designed with a comprehensive set of prior
policy actions covering the three social sectors: health, education, and social protection. All the
PDO indicators reached or exceeded their set targets. However, many intermediary outcomes
were not met, mostly because the set targets were overambitious, often due to a lack of available
baseline data for new services being rolled out by the Government. Implementation by the
Government, particularly in the area of health, was strong. Of particular note was the
Government’s efforts to put in place their own monitoring and evaluation tools, including a
regular and transparent reporting to the public on the implementation of the ESSNS, the carrying
out of an audit by the State Audit Office of measures supported by the SDPL, and the impact
evaluation carried out for the emergency public works WWS program.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Context at appraisal of SDPL1
1.     After EU accession in 2004, the Latvian economy experienced rapid economic
growth, driven partly by expansionary macroeconomic policies. Average growth stayed
above ten percent over 2004-2007 and was almost entirely driven by a domestic demand boom.
Large real wage increases, pro-cyclical fiscal policy, capital inflows, and a rapid credit expansion
fueled domestic demand. However, labor shortages and out-migration to EU15 countries soon
pushed up nominal wages, causing a rapid deterioration in external competitiveness.
2.      The overheating pressures led to the development of large macroeconomic
imbalances. The rapid growth of public expenditures—increasing by 90 percent in real terms
between 2003 and 2008—resulted in a widening of the cyclically-adjusted fiscal deficit to 6.2
percent of GDP in 2008. At the same time, vibrant domestic demand brought consumer price
inflation up to 18 percent in the first half of 2008, while competitiveness deteriorated rapidly. As
a result, the external current account deficit widened from nine percent in mid-2004 to almost 25
percent of GDP in mid-2007. The fixed exchange rate peg with the Euro facilitated foreign
borrowing by the financial sector. By the end of 2007, this had driven external debts to 128
percent of GDP. The inflow of capital fuelled rapid credit expansion and a real estate bubble.
3.      This combination of credit and housing bubbles made the Latvian economy very
vulnerable to the global financial crisis in late 2008. Markets became concerned over the
sustainability of the peg, and the likelihood that contingent financial sector liabilities had to be
absorbed by the Government. Latvia’s Eurobond spread widened rapidly and Latvia was
downgraded by all three rating agencies. Private bank deposits fell by 19 percent between end-
August 2008 and end-September 2009, precipitated by the run on mostly non-resident deposits in
the Parex Bank. Deposit withdrawals and declining international reserves put substantial pressure
on the exchange rate peg arrangement. As a result, Latvia approached the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the European Commission (EC) for emergency financial support in November
2008. The financial turmoil resulted in a collapse of the real economy in late 2008; GDP fell by
4.2 percent in 2008 and 18.0 percent in 2009.
4.     The Latvian government responded to the crisis with a reform program supported
by the EC, international financial institutions, and bilateral donors. As the Government
decided to maintain the fixed exchange rate peg with the Euro, a strong internal adjustment was
needed to ensure long-term external stability. This adjustment was done through cuts in both
public and private sector nominal wages and a substantial fiscal consolidation. The stabilization
program required large external financing from international financial institutions, with a
package of EUR 7.5 billion agreed in December 2008 and provided by the EC, the IMF, the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Bank, and

                                                 1
bilaterally through support from several Nordic and Central European countries. The
stabilization program aimed to contain the growing public debt, while also enabling Latvia to
meet the Maastricht criteria in future years. 11 The World Bank agreed to support Latvia’s
stabilization program with EUR 400 million in funding. As Latvia is a graduated country, the
exceptional access to IBRD resources was provided on non-standard lending terms, through a
Special Development Policy Loan (SDPL). Apart from the Safety Net and Social Sector Reform
Program DPL series, the World Bank provided a Financial Sector Development Policy Loan of
EUR 200 million to support financial sector strengthening in 2009.
5.      Expenditure cuts dominated the fiscal adjustment, accounting for more than three-
quarters of the fiscal savings. Public spending was cut by 14 percent of GDP during 2009-2010
as compared to projected fiscal outcomes prior to the program. This allowed the fiscal deficit to
fall from 9.8 percent of GDP in 2009 to 8.2 percent of GDP in 2010. The social sectors—namely
education and health—contributed substantially to the consolidation effort: from 2008 to 2010
the health budget was cut by 25 percent and the education budget was cut by 48 percent. At the
same time, social insurance spending continued to rise sharply (by 17 percent) in 2009 driven by
increases in pensions, before being somewhat reduced by 3.5 percent in 2010.12
6.       Despite the severity and speed of the adjustment, the Government took advantage of
the fiscal consolidation to undertake structural reforms in the social sectors. In all social
sectors, the main medium- and long-term challenge in Latvia is adapting to a decreasing and
aging population. The population in Latvia has fallen by 5.6 percent since 2000 and is expected
to fall by a further 19 percent by 2060.13 At the same time, the population is getting significantly
older. This demographic shift is having and will continue to have significant fiscal and design
implications for social sector policy.
7.     In education, the challenge is to adapt the school infrastructure to the shrinking
student population. Per capita financing was introduced in the education sector in the 2009
academic year and the network of vocational schools was consolidated under the management of
municipal governments in order to adjust to the marked decline in the student population in the
past decade. This led to the closing of 12 percent of primary and secondary schools.
8.      In health care, the challenge is to adapt to an aging population and reduce the gaps
in health outcomes in Latvia compared to pre-2004 EU member states. The difference in
mortality rates for men from heart disease and strokes in Latvia are particularly striking.
Therefore, during the crisis the Government worked not only to gain fiscal savings in the health
sector, but also to re-orient spending toward out-patient and hospital day-care procedures. To do
this, the sector began to correct the overprovision of hospital beds in order to free resources to

protect essential preventive and outpatient care provision. The result was a 19 percent reduction
in hospital beds (amounting to 3,200 beds) from 2008 to 2010. Co-payments for services were
increased to control demand, and excessive costs were reduced by shifting health care toward
out-patient and hospital day-care procedures. At the same time, out-patient and GP services were
relatively protected from budget cuts.
9.      The social consequences of the economic contraction in Latvia were deep and most
severe among the poorest households, making specific interventions targeted to the most
vulnerable necessary. According to Household Budget Survey data, the percentage of people
below the needy line increased from 13.9 percent in 2008 to 22.5 percent in 2009 and 24 percent
in 2010 due to the GDP and employment contraction.14 15 Unemployment almost tripled during
the crisis, rising sharply from seven percent on average over 2007-2008 to 20.1 percent in the
last quarter of 2009. Moreover, the lower-skilled segment of the labor force suffered
disproportionately from the deterioration in labor market conditions. The hardest hit groups were
workers with a basic education or less who experienced a 40 percent employment reduction
between the beginning of 2007 and early 2010. Employment also fell sharply among workers
with upper secondary school only—by 21 percent from 2007 to 2010. In contrast, workers with
higher education benefitted from an increase in employment during the same period.
10.     To mitigate the effects of the crisis on the most vulnerable, while supporting
measures to improve efficiency in the social sectors, the Government put in place an
Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy (ESSNS) in September 2009. 16 This strategy was
supported by international donors supporting Latvia’s crisis response, including the World Bank
through the Special Development Policy Loan (SDPL) series. The EU-IMF program included an
adjustor that allowed for additional fiscal spending on social safety nets, as defined under the
World Bank SDPL series or Government of Latvia Strategy (of, for example, up to LVL 35
million per quarter, or about one percent of GDP per annum, in 2010). The World Bank assisted
the Government in its preparation of the ESSNS and in assessing public expenditure
consolidation and structural reform options through the preparation of a Public Expenditure
Review (PER) in 2010. The World Bank then contributed financing for the social safety net and
social sector reforms through a program of two SDPL operations, amounting to a total of EUR
200 million.

   A household is defined as ―needy‖ if its per capita income (before WWS stipend) is less than 90 LVL per month.
Latvia has no official poverty line but the LVL 90 per capita per month is known as the ―needy‖ line.
15
   The number of people living below the needy line of 90 LVL a month estimated using Household Budget Survey
data is higher than the official certified needy figure. From estimates using Household Budget Survey data, it
appears that only around 39.1 percent of people with income levels that make them eligible for needy status were
certified in 2011.
16
   The Strategy was adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers on September 8, 2009.

Context at appraisal of SDPL2
11.     Economic activity picked up in the second half of 2010. An expansion in exports,
recovering domestic demand, lower Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads, lower interest rates and
extended maturities in the domestic debt market showed that stabilization was under way in
2010. This economic recovery was projected to continue in 2011. In the first quarter of 2011,
real GDP projections (about 3.3 percent for 2011 and 4 percent for 2012 and 2013) were
supported by improved consumer confidence, forecasts of higher corporate profitability, and the
ongoing recovery of Latvia’s trading partners. Unemployment was also seen to be declining,
albeit slowly. While unemployment was on average slowly falling, there had not been a recovery
in employment for the population with basic education or less. Furthermore, the situation of the
most vulnerable in society had been worsening, with the number of people defined as needy and
the number of GMI participants steadily increasing throughout 2010. Real income per capita
continued to decline: after falling by 17.7 percent in 2009, average real disposable income per
capita decreased by another 2.1 percent in 2010. The drop in the incomes of the bottom quintile
was larger than average.
12.     Latvia moved toward meeting medium-term fiscal targets with the continued
consolidation included in the 2011 budget. In addition to the 2011 budget adopted at the end of
2010, the Parliament passed a supplementary budget on April 2011. These budgets included
fiscal consolidation measures totaling around LVL350 million or 2.6 percent of the 2010 GDP,
to keep the fiscal deficit 17 below 4.5 percent of GDP in 2011, with the aim of meeting the
Maastricht criterion of a fiscal deficit below three percent of GDP in 2012. The consolidation
program included several revenue generating measures, accounting for 1.8 percent of GDP.18 It
also included a decrease in expenditure through reduced staff and wage costs in the public
administration and cuts in the health, education, defense, social programs, and railway sectors.
Temporary measures to achieve these goals were also put in place, such as a diversion of second
pillar pension contributions. The Government demonstrated its commitment to the continued
implementation of the ESSNS by securing 0.6 percent of GDP to finance it.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives and Key Indicators
13.     The Program Development Objectives (PDO) of the SDPL series were to: (i) protect
vulnerable groups with emergency safety net support during the economic contraction; (ii)
mitigate the social costs of fiscal consolidation; and (iii) ensure that structural reforms lay a
foundation for medium-term improvements in the social sectors. Given the deep impact of the
global crisis on Latvia and due to the emergency nature of this program, the first operation
focused mainly on the first and second objectives. The second operation expanded the focus to

  The revenue measures included increases in VAT rates, employee social security contributions, taxation of
vehicles, real estate taxes, excise duties, and new fees.

14.     The monitoring and results framework included numerous indicators to follow the
implementation of the SDPL series.19 The overall 11 Project Outcome Indicators presented in
Table 1 are a representative selection of the full set of indicators and are used as proxies for the
full Prior Actions.

1.3 Revised Program Development Objectives and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification
15.     No revisions were made to the original PDO. Some changes affected the Key Indicators,
such as the one-year delay in the increase of the funded pension pillar contribution rate (see
section 2.2 for details).

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program
16.    The SDPL series supported a large social sector reform program, including policy
measures in four main policy areas in line with the PDO and outcome indicators mentioned
above, to:
        Support the deployment of emergency social safety net measures to mitigate the impact
         of the fiscal adjustment and the economic contraction on households, by: (i) ensuring
         adequate emergency safety net financing for education and health services, and social
         protection programs; and (ii) increasing public awareness, transparency, and
         accountability of government measures in the social sectors;
        Strengthen the financing of social protection by: (i) restoring sustainable funding of
         second pillar pensions through an increased contribution rate; (ii) lengthening eligibility
         for unemployment insurance; (iii) securing adequate financing of the GMI benefit from
         the State budget 20 ; and (iv) providing work for the unemployed not entitled to
         unemployment insurance in the emergency public works WWS program;
        Improve the coverage, effectiveness, and efficiency of health care by: (i) introducing for
         the first time a safety net to ensure access to health care, including pharmaceuticals, for
         the needy; and (ii) strengthening primary care services and substituting for expensive and
         inappropriate inpatient stays by increasing use of outpatient surgery and alternatives to
         overnight hospital stays via changes in reimbursement policies. These measures indeed
         allowed closure of overnight hospitals, including in Riga; and
        Maintain access to education, by (i) providing a State subsidy to maintain an adequate
         level of local government financing for preschool programs for five- and six-year-old
         children, (ii) providing transportation to another school for students whose schools have
         closed; and (iii) improving the targeting of higher education state support to students
         from lower income backgrounds. It is to be noted that these measures accompanied the
         implementation of per capita financing in general education.


19
   These indicators were given in Annex 4 of the SDPL1 program document and in Annex 8 of the SDPL2 program
document.
20
   Additional funds for GMI allowed both improving the coverage and raising the level of benefits.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance
19.     The SDPL programmatic series of two operations followed the single-operation Financial
Sector DPL approved on September 22, 2009 for EUR 200 million. Together, these three DPLs
represented the World Bank’s contribution of EUR 400 million of the EUR 7.5 billion
international crisis-response package of the IMF, EC, EBRD, Nordic and Central European
countries. The World Bank team collaborated closely with the IMF and European Commission
(EC) teams, and agreed on complementarities and mutually-supportive measures.
20.    In the summer of 2007, the Government asked the World Bank to conduct a Public
Expenditure Review (PER) for the social sectors. This assessment served as an analytical input
for the Government’s ESSNS program, revisions to the 2009 budget, and formulation of the
2010 budget. It examined public investment and outcomes in the social sectors and public
administration, and identified a number of critical structural reforms. In September 2010, the
World Bank updated the 2007 PER and examined options for fiscal consolidation and structural
reforms in health, education, social protection, and public administration. The results of the PER
process were shared with the Government during numerous visits to Latvia from March to
December 2010, with the aim of informing the budget formulation process. This technical
analysis formed the basis for the policy actions supported under the second SDPL operation.

Note: (*) The loan was fully disbursed in Euros (100 million). As the Euro-USD exchange rate varied from approval
to disbursement, the actual disbursed amount in USD was lower than initially expected.


21.    In addition to the 2010 PER, the SDPL lending program was accompanied by a thorough
technical assistance program covering the social sector and public administration reform (see
Annex 5 for a description). The World Bank provided advisory support to the Government on: (i)



                                                        7
the design and implementation of the ESSNS, and (ii) monitoring and evaluation of the impact of
ESSNS measures, including help to design the evaluation program for the WWS program.
22.    To support the Government’s program, the SDPL series set out ten policy actions to be
undertaken prior to the first loan and eight additional policy actions triggering the second loan.
Table 2 provides an overview of the SDPL series. Annex 3 contains the full policy matrix as
presented at the SDPL2 Board Presentation, with outcome indicators and goals specified.
23.     All SDPL1 Prior Actions were met before the Board presentation in March 2010. The
first SDPL was subsequently fully disbursed on September 27, 2010 and the loan closed on its
original closing date of December 31, 2010.
24.     All prior conditions for the second SDPL were met on time and the second SDPL was
fully disbursed on December 20, 2011 as described in Annex 4. The second loan closed on its
original closing date of December 31, 2011.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Content of the program
25.     By design, the SDPL series was ambitious enough to cover all social sectors, allowing the
program to address the adverse impacts of either the crisis or the fiscal consolidation. Within
each sector, the measures promoted by the SDPL series also covered several sub-sectors: (i)
social assistance, activation policies, pensions and other social insurance in social protection, (ii)
outpatient, inpatient and pharmaceuticals in the health sector and (iii) from pre-school to
university in the education sector.

Ownership of the reforms by the Government
26.      The need for an emergency safety net was signaled by the World Bank team during its
initial visit, based on a review of existing programs and the fast-developing realization that the
severity of the economic crisis was fast outstripping anyone’s predictions. However, the program
was owned from the start by the Government, which designed the ESSNS through an inter-
ministerial task force chaired by the Ministry of Finance. Not all the measures undertaken by the
ESSNS were supported by the SDPL series as the strategy itself was wider in coverage. Besides
social protection, health, and education, it also encompassed measures in the housing and
transportation sectors. Moreover, the Government disclosed extensive information to the public
on the implementation of the ESSNS, in addition to the indicators agreed under the World Bank-
supported program. This showed the Government’s commitment to the objective of assisting the
poor and vulnerable at a time of severe economic stress. Furthermore, the extension of elements
of the ESSNS beyond the end of the World Bank-supported program (see section 2.4) is
testimony of the Latvian Government’s ownership of the reforms.
27.    The SDPL series benefited from the continuity of the Government from program
conception to implementation. Prime Minister Dombrovskis remained in power, although as a

                                                  8
head of different coalitions of parties, from March 2009 to date, despite parliamentary elections
(in October 2010 and September 2011). This brought continuity in the Government’s
commitment to the SDPL series. The ministries of Finance, Welfare, Health, and Education and
Science did see their management change following each election; fortunately, these changes did
not materially affect the performance of the reforms.

Sound and timely background analysis and policy dialogue
28.    As noted earlier, the program benefitted from timely and extensive social sector analyses
and PERs available at the time of the crisis. This enabled the Government to put in place targeted
and efficient measures in a short time period. The ESSNS was designed, approved, and put in
place within six months, from June to November 2009.
29.     The SDPL series also benefited from continuous policy dialogue between World Bank
staff and the Government. This allowed for improvement of the content of the second SDPL,
especially in the health sector, from what was envisioned during the preparation of the first loan,
within a limited timeframe.

Policy reversal
30.     The implementation of the reform on scholarships in higher education was discontinued
in the third quarter of 2011. An amendment to the Cabinet Regulation on scholarships was
passed on June 2, 2009 (No. 511), adding social considerations, in addition to merit, as a
criterion for awarding State support to students in higher education. This policy action was a
prior condition to be met for the first SDPL. This measure had positive consequences as the
share of eligible students receiving stipends based on social considerations exceeded
expectations, reaching 60 percent during 2010 and the first semester of 2011, far above the
baseline of 39 percent in 2009. However, this legislation was overruled by the Constitutional
Court of Latvia on August 9, 2011. According to the ruling, stipends should be allocated first on
the basis of academic achievement; social considerations only apply as a secondary criterion, to
allocate stipends among students of equal academic achievement. The implementation of the
reform was therefore halted in the second half of 2011 in compliance with the Constitutional
Court ruling.

Cooperation with other partners of Latvia
31.    The commitment of the Government to pursue the reforms was helped by the support of
the EC, the IMF, and bilateral donors. Coordination among lenders allowed the country to
dedicate a substantial share of its budget to the ESSNS in a time of high fiscal pressures. The
EU-IMF stabilization program strongly backed these temporary measures and included an
adjustor to fiscal targets allowing for additional safety net spending if necessary. The Bank team
provided economic expertise during the 2009, 2010, and 2011 budget cycles and through the
PER in 2010 that supplemented the macroeconomic focus of the other lenders and of the
government during the crisis. The Bank’s engagement was considered a necessity by these

                                                9
partners on social sector expenditure issues that went well beyond the safety net supported by the
Bank’s loans.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization
32.    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and implementation arrangements were continuous
and contributed to reform implementation, the achievement of the development objectives, and
the improvement of the ESSNS.

Design
33.     The indicators chosen to monitor the outcomes were adequate, covering all three social
sectors and the three PDOs in detail. The fact that many intermediate indicators were not or only
partially achieved, while the outcome indicators were achieved, suggests that they were not good
indicators of interim progress towards the PDIs. Perhaps unique in this operation, and reflecting
an effort by the team to depend on normal Borrower systems to the degree possible in
implementing the agreements, the Bank team sought guidance from the State Audit Office of the
Republic of Latvia (SAO) to specify the indicators and the PDOs in such a way that they would
lend themselves to normal auditing procedures by the Government.

Implementation
34.     Procedures and adequate financing were incorporated into the ESSNS to allow close
monitoring of its implementation and evaluation of its impact. The Government regularly
monitored around 35 indicators pertaining to the ESSNS, which they then updated and published
every quarter on the internet. 21 Baseline and updated data were provided by the respective
specialized agencies for the pertinent functions and tracked according to the indicators and
outcome measures.
35.    Moreover, the SAO, which reports independently to Parliament and is a key institution
for public sector accountability, evaluated the Government’s performance in implementing the
ESSNS under SDPL1, with the auditor’s report being made available to the Government prior to
the end of the first year of implementation of the program.22 This report was also used by the
Bank team appraising SDPL2 in its discussions with each ministry and the Ministry of Finance,
and the team reviewed with the SAO the results of the audit in detail. The fundamental problem
found by the audit was that the legal process for the certification of needy people was not
adequately followed by local authorities and that benefits were paid to non-eligible households.

This shortcoming affected both the social assistance and health portions of the program; although
the leakage was relatively small, the audit revealed simple ways public records could have been
used by local authorities to verify eligibility. Overall, 24 recommendations were formulated by
the SAO, consisting of three categories, namely: (i) changes to regulations/legal acts; (ii)
improvements in monitoring and internal control systems; and (iii) recommendations regarding
measures under the ESSNS that expired on December 31, 2011. As part of the normal audit
process, each government agency was required to file a response to the audit and an action plan
to correct the deficiencies within one year of the report, or in this case, October 2011. These
action plans are monitored by the SAO. The audit of the ESSNS was widely disseminated by the
SAO, including being made publicly-available on the internet. Action plans with the relevant
ministries were actually agreed prior to publication, so the action plans by the ministries were in
place prior to appraisal of the second loan. The audit made extensive use of country databases
and information to cross-check the implementation of the ESSNS at the national and municipal
levels against the stated policies and aims of the program. It used the data collected through the
program to assess the targeting of social assistance and identify leakages. All necessary
amendments to regulations were implemented. Regarding the system of controls, the Ministry of
Welfare improved the system of checks and balances applied to GMI monitoring and provided
training seminars to social workers of local authorities. The Ministry produced a report on the
follow-up implementation of the SAO’s recommendations. However, no assessment has yet been
undertaken by the SAO of the implementation of the program subsequent to October 2011.
36.     The Government carried out an impact evaluation of the emergency public works WWS
program with technical assistance from the World Bank. The evaluation was based on a unique
household survey administered to 3,000 households (9,054 respondents, including 2,309 WWS
participants and 1,016 persons from the waiting list) conducted between December 2010 and
March 2011. An evaluation of the WWS intervention based on the survey data was done by the
World Bank (see Ajwad, Azam, and Ferré, 2012) and also by local researchers Latvijas
Lauksaimniecības un Meža Zin?tņu Akadēmija (Latvian Academy of Agricultural and Forestry
Sciences, 2011)23. The World Bank evaluation found that the WWS self-targeting mechanism
worked well, with most WWS beneficiaries belonging to the bottom 40 percent of the
income/welfare distribution (poor and vulnerable), with the income quintile two highly
represented. Similarly, the evaluation found that administration and implementation of the
program were satisfactory, with payments being made accurately and on time. The WWS
program had long waiting lists and large numbers of workers re-registered. This demonstrates

that people valued the WWS program and also that the program was too small given the
devastating impact of the crisis. In addition, most program beneficiaries had positive views about
the program administration and implementation. The Government showed strong ownership of
the impact evaluation and conducted a peer learning event with 10 other EU countries, Croatia,
and Norway on April 26-27, 2012 to discuss the lessons from the emergency public works
program and share the results of the evaluation.

Utilization
37.    The audit and its use by the Government represent best practice in the use of country
systems to monitor and evaluate a World Bank-supported program, and to use the information to
improve implementation and results. Given the complex nature of structural reforms and
emergency assistance supported by the SDPL program, it would have been impossible for the
World Bank team to conduct such a comprehensive and thorough fiduciary assessment of
performance of the various systems involved down to the local government level. By
coordinating with the SAO and involving that office at the design stage of the loan, both the
Government of Latvia and the Bank benefited from having a timely, on-the-ground assessment
of program implementation after the first year of the program. Having action plans in each
ministry in place prior to the second year immeasurably improved confidence on all sides that
program implementation would be improved in the second year.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation
38.     The ESSNS was initially foreseen to be effective from October 1, 2009 (Cabinet of
Ministers adopted the Strategy on September 8, 2009) until December 31, 2011. The
continuation of some strategy measures into 2012 was discussed in the Cabinet of Ministers’
meetings on November 4 and 8, 2011. The decision was made to continue implementing the
measures related to social assistance, health, and transportation. Consequently, only three
measures supported by the SDPL series were stopped on December 2011: (i) the state financing
for the transportation of students from closed to new schools, which was taken over by local
governments; (ii) the emergency public works WWS program, which was replaced by a smaller
program that built on the findings of the WWS evaluation; and (iii) the measure providing for
social conditions in addition to merit as criteria for eligibility of stipends in higher education
(overruled by the Constitutional Court). Further continuation of the Strategy measures in 2013
are to be discussed in July 2012 during the preparation process of the State Budget for 2013.
39.     After the closing of the SDPL series, the Ministry of Welfare expressed interest in
engaging the World Bank to carry out an evaluation of the employment and social protection
situation in Latvia, especially with respect to the situation of the long-term unemployed and the
inactive. The commitment of the Ministry is underlined by the fact that this activity is a Fee-
Based Service (FBS). The study will analyze the unemployment, tax, and benefit systems to
support the re-integration of the long-run unemployed into the labor market, with a focus on: (i)
the evolution of the Latvian labor market emerging from the crisis; (ii) profiles of people with no

                                                12
or limited labor-market attachment; (iii) expenditure and performance of welfare benefits and
employment in Latvia; (iv) financial incentives of the tax and benefit system in Latvia; (v) the
impact of employment policies; (vi) other countries’ experiences in linking social benefit
programs to employment activation measures; and (vii) options for the design of income and
work support measures to promote labor force participation, whilst providing adequate social
protection. The Cabinet of Ministers met on April 3, 2012 and approved the FBS terms of
reference and the Legal Agreement was signed on May 25, 2012. This work will assist the
Government in motivating future reforms. It could also inform the 2013 budget planning.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of objectives
40.    As Latvia graduated from World Bank financing in 2007, the last Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) expired in 2005 and was focused on accession to the EU, an objective that was
reached in 2004. The SDPL series drew, however, from a series of successful projects with the
World Bank undertaken in the social sectors prior to graduating. 24 Moreover, a PER was
prepared by the World Bank in 2007 at the request of the Ministry of Finance and updated in
2010, helping to put in place a swift program to respond to the crisis.
41.     The objectives of the SDPL were, and still are, highly relevant to Latvia’s social sector
reform program (see paragraph 13 for a description of the PDOs). The three objectives were in
line with the policy actions of the Government’s stabilization program signed on December 19,
2008 with the EU, the IMF, and bilateral and multilateral donors.
42.     The SDPL series supported the protection of vulnerable groups with emergency
safety net support during the economic contraction. Given the severity of the economic crisis,
its deep social consequences on the labor force and the fact that low-skilled workers were the
most affected, the interventions supported by the programmatic SDPL series to protect the
vulnerable groups were appropriate and timely. The crisis induced a sharp increase in
unemployment: the unemployment rate more than tripled in two years, from 5.4 percent in late
2007 to 20.1 percent in late 2009. But the safety nets in place at the time of the crisis were not
adequate: (i) the coverage of unemployment insurance was around 40 percent of the newly
unemployed in 2008; (ii) the coverage of last resort social assistance program was small (22.8
percent of those certified as needy were receiving the GMI in 2008); and (iii) its adequacy was

  The Latvia Welfare Reform Project (P035807) that supported structural reforms in social protection during the
1990s closed with a highly satisfactory rating in 2003. The Latvia Health Reform Project (P058520) closed in 2001
with a satisfactory rating and the Education Improvement Project (P049172) closed in 2004 with a satisfactory
rating.


                                                       13
low, as the GMI benefit was set to 27 LVL per month per person in 2008, 25 representing less
than 15 percent of median per capita monthly income. The first SDPL objective was therefore
highly relevant.
43.     The SDPL series assisted in mitigating the social costs of fiscal consolidation. As the
Government introduced large cuts in social spending to contain the public deficit, the SDPL
series was relevant to minimize potential adverse effects and maintain access to public services,
especially for the poorest households, while improving efficiency in the social sectors. Fiscal
pressure on the budget was high, with a public deficit reaching 7.5 percent in 2008 and 7.8
percent, leading to fiscal consolidation. Efficiency of spending was low, both in the health sector
and the education sector, suggesting that the social sectors could not be spared from that
consolidation. Real spending decreased by 20.8 percent between 2008 and 2009 in health26, 21.7
percent in education,27 and 8.9 percent in social assistance28. In the context of crisis, the ESSNS
was highly relevant to protect the most vulnerable households from this severe contraction in
public spending and the second objective of the series was highly relevant.
44.     The SDPL series sought to support reforms that lay a foundation for medium-term
improvements in the social sectors. The project documentation clearly suggests that this
objective focuses on structural reforms that might improve social spending efficiency, although
its formulation was rather generic. Efficiency of social spending was an issue prior to the crisis.
The education system contained an excessive number of teaching staff, schools were numerous
and small, while the quality of education as measured by the Program for International Student
Assessment (PISA) remained well below EU average. The structure of health care financing
raised costs, with little impact on health outcomes that were among the worst in the region. And,
as previously mentioned, the coverage and adequacy of social assistance programs remained
meager, with spending on the last resort poverty benefit only about 0.2 percent of GDP, one of
the lowest shares of spending among the countries in the EU. The third objective was therefore
highly relevant as improvement in the social sectors was needed.

Relevance of design and implementation
45.    The design of the SDPL series was also relevant. The loans were based on a
comprehensive set of analytical studies including an evaluation of the likely poverty and social
impacts due to the impact of the crisis on the labor market, reviews of revenue and public
expenditure, and technical notes on international best practice (see Annex 5). This informed the
Government and the team in selecting the key areas where significant efficiency gains could be

   The GMI benefit was increased to 37 LVL per month per person in 2009 and from October 2009 was set to 40
LVL per adult and 45 LVL per child.

achieved in a short time frame. Initial triggers for the second loan and prior actions were
designed accordingly.
46.     The program was designed as two successive operations because the overall program was
ambitious and included measures that would require some time to be adequately implemented,
and it covered three budget cycles, including the supplemental budget in 2009, the 2010 budget,
and the 2011 budget. Splitting the program assured that the Bank team would be appraising the
program as the budgets were developed and approved, which also coincided with high-profile
IMF and EC discussions with the government. The first SDPL focused especially on the
mitigation of the crisis and the fiscal consolidation, as those objectives needed to be addressed in
the short term. Then one year later, the second operation continued to support emergency crisis
measures and built on the measures of the first operation focusing on medium-term
improvements, particularly in the health sector.
47.     The indicators chosen were proxies for the prior actions, selected from the larger set of
indicators in the results framework. Overall, the indicators chosen to measure the achievement of
the PDOs were relevant as they covered the three objectives in each of the three sub-sectors.
However, the targets set for several intermediary outcomes were ambitious, given how the
potential number of beneficiaries emerged and they did not provide for an accurate assessment of
progress towards the PDIs.
48.     Each of the three parts of the PDO was covered by at least one policy action in each
subsector, as seen in Table 3. First, transfers to poor households during the crisis were monitored
in the areas of social protection, health, and education. Second, the main mitigation measures,
that guaranteed a minimal level of spending in the three social subsectors, were directly captured
by the indicators. Third, the remaining indicators describe the medium-term reforms, namely the
enhanced transparency in the implementation of reforms, the shift from inpatient to preventive
and outpatient care in the health sector, and the measures taken to accompany the
implementation of the per capita financing in education.
49.     A majority of the Development Objective indicators chosen were output indicators
covering the three subsectors. In health, the number of the GPs with an extra nurse and the
number of subsidized health visits are clear outputs of the program. In education, pre-school
enrollment rates, travel time to the school, the share of students receiving assistance for
transportation and through stipends are also quantitative outputs of the program. In social
protection, beneficiaries of the extension of the unemployment benefit duration or the WWS
program are also outputs of the program.
50.    The remaining indicators were process-oriented and allowed monitoring the adequacy of
the funding of the program as well as evaluation of the strategy.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory

PDO (i): Protection of the vulnerable households during the crisis
51.     The efficacy of the SDPL series in the achievement of the first objective is
substantial. Protection of poor households during the crisis has been achieved through targeted
interventions in health, education, and social protection. As displayed in Table 4, the targets set
for the performance indicators were mostly met and in some cases exceeded.

52.     In health: The social safety nets deployed allowed not only the protection of the poor
from budget cuts but also improvements to both their financial protection and their access to
care. Indeed, the number of subsidized outpatient visits increased by 89 percent from 2009 to
2011. At the same time, the number of inpatient subsidized visits decreased by 6 percent from
2009 to 2011. This reduction in inpatient care was more than compensated for by the provision
of subsidized hotel accommodation for hospital patients and 222,683 subsidized home care visits
in 2011. The access to mental care for the needy was also largely expanded as the number of
visits increased nine fold. Moreover, during the program, around 20,000 needy patients also
benefited from free medicines.30
53.     In education: The reform of stipends in tertiary education improved significantly the
equity of aid to students, as the share of stipends attributed to social considerations grew from 39
percent in 2009 to 60 percent in 2011. This measure resulted in additional monetary support
targeted to poor students. However, as this reform was overruled by the Constitutional Court, its
impact has not been sustained.
54.     In social protection, three distinct interventions were set up to mitigate the effects of the
crisis on households. First, the duration of the unemployment insurance was extended; second, a


29
   The rate of coverage can be computed either as (i) the monthly average number of GMI beneficiaries divided by
the monthly number of needy people; or (ii) the total distinct number of GMI beneficiaries throughout the year
divided by the total distinct number of people certified as needy during the same year. The first method is consistent
with the way the targets were set out in the two program documents for the SDPL series, where targets were set out
on a quarterly basis. The second method gives a better account of the number of people who benefitted from the
program at some point during the year. Although the indicators for the rate of coverage calculated by both methods
differ, both indicators remain below the expected target of 50 percent.
30
   The number of patients who benefitted from fully free medicines varied from one quarter to another, from 22,000
in the second quarter of 2011 to 17,000 in the last quarter of the same year.

public works program, the WWS, was implemented under the ESSNS; and third, the state co-
financing for social assistance benefits was introduced. However, the percentage of newly-
registered unemployed eligible for unemployment insurance benefit remained below the target of
60 percent. This target was too ambitious given the severity of the crisis and the dramatic
increase in unemployment that ensued.
55.     According to the evaluation undertaken by the World Bank, the public works program
WWS implemented under the ESSNS was successful31: (i) targeting performance was good as
most WWS beneficiaries were poor and vulnerable people; (ii) administration and
implementation were satisfactory as payments were accurate and on time, supervision was good
and beneficiaries rated the program positively; and (iii) the program performed as a safety net by
mitigating the impact of income shocks and protecting households from adopting harmful coping
strategies. It was also a substitute for other safety nets. However, the scale of WWS was small
relative to the demand, as between 20,000 and 30,000 persons were on the waiting list, compared
with the 82,000 workplaces created from 2010 to 2011.

56.     Despite a very rapid growth in GMI benefits—beneficiary numbers increased three-
fold over 2009-2011—the program never reached the target of covering 50 percent of needy
people (see Figure 1). The eligibility threshold for the GMI program was too low to allow the
target of 50 percent coverage of the needy to be reached. The needy line was set at 90 LVL per

month per person, while the GMI eligibility threshold was much lower at 40 LVL per adult and
45 LVL per child per month. The share of the needy with incomes low enough to qualify for
GMI was smaller than the 50 percent of the needy target set in the SDPL program. Therefore,
meeting the 50 percent target would have required a much more precipitous drop in incomes of
the poorest segment of the population than occurred.
57.     However, according to municipal level data, the spatial inequity of GMI spending
across municipalities narrowed following the introduction of the SDPL series. As displayed
in Table 5, the average GMI spending per needy person at the municipal level increased by 78
percent between 2010 and 2009, and increased further by about 26 percent in 2011. At the same
time, inequalities between municipalities, as measured by the standard deviation of the average
GMI spending by needy person decreased drastically in relative terms. Finally, the negative
correlation between the share of the needy in the total population and average GMI spending by
needy person dropped from 2009 to 2011, when co-financing from the state budget was in place.
This negative correlation illustrates that in municipalities with larger needy populations,
spending per needy person is lower. The fact that the negative correlation diminished shows that
the co-financing of GMI spending by the central government was effective in equalizing GMI
spending for potential beneficiaries across municipalities over a period when local government
budgets were constrained.

PDO (ii): Mitigation of the impacts of fiscal consolidation
58.     The efficacy of the SDPL series in the achievement of the second objective is
substantial. The targets were met for the performance indicators (see Table 6), and the program
managed to preserve an adequate funding level targeted on the vulnerable and poor households,
despite large cuts in the budgets of all the social sectors.

59.     In order to mitigate the effects of the fiscal consolidation in the social sectors, the SDPL
series aimed first at guaranteeing adequate funding for the implementation of the ESSNS.
Overall, the budget allocated for the ESSNS was adequate both in 2010 and 2011 (see Table 7).
The actual spending for the ESSNS increased by 34 percent compared to the spending planned in
the initial budget in 2010: the planned spending was LVL 56.3 million and the actual spending
increased to LVL 77.3 million. The fiscal consolidation process was difficult, particularly during
the 2010 discussions on the 2011 budget cuts. In the version of the 2011 budget, which was sent
to Parliament in November 2010, the plan was to cut resources for the WWS program and state
co-financing for the GMI program by about 40 percent overall in 2011. The World Bank team
advocated for a larger budget allocation for the strategy. Following discussions with the EU,
IMF, and World Bank, the Latvian Government decided to maintain the social safety net
spending at 2010 levels in 2011. For GMI, it was possible to make the 2011 budget modification
prior to the final passing of the Budget Law 2011 by the Saeima in December 2010. The WWS


                                                       21
funding contained in the 2011 budget was later supplemented by additional resources from the
European Social Fund (ESF) in 2011.32
60.    Actual state budget spending for the ESSNS measures in 2011 was about 100 percent of
the 2010 executed budget. Spending on the health safety net increased by 28 percent in nominal
terms in 2011 compared to 2010. Funding was cut for the transportation of students due to lower
than expected demand and the WWS program funding was reduced by 30 percent. Given the
continued high demand for the WWS program, it would have been desirable to increase or
maintain funding in 2011 at 2010 levels. However, given the considerable fiscal consolidation
pressures, the Government kept to their plan of winding down the program in 2011.

61.     In health: The Government introduced substantial cuts in the health sector (see Table 8).
However, spending cuts have been focused strategically on the least efficient areas, such as
inpatient spending (fell by 50 percent in real terms), while critical services (such as emergency
care which rose by one percent in real terms), were spared. About seven percent of the total
health expenditure was directed toward putting in place the social safety net (amounting to 30
million LVL in 2011), which focused on needy and low income households.




32
  The funding of the WWS from the state budget was cut by 45 percent compared to 2010 in the Budget Law 2011
passed by the Saeima in December 2010. This was supplemented by additional resources from European Social
Fund (ESF) in 2011. Following the passing of the 2011 Budget Law, the Government requested a reallocation of
LVL 5 million of ESF resources into the WWS program. The EU accepted the proposal in March 2011 and the
Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal on April 12, 2011.

62.     In education: Public education funding was reduced as part of the fiscal adjustment that
followed the crisis (see Table 9). Total government spending on education fell by 36 percent in
nominal terms and 38 percent in real terms from 2008 to 2010. 33 Although nominal spending
grew by one percent in 2011, it continued to shrink in real terms by three percent. Rapidly
declining enrollment since 2008 compensated to some extent for this fall in funding. However,
the per student allocation still decreased in real terms by about 20 percent in general education,
30 percent in pre-school education, and 51 percent in higher education.

63.    In 2005, the Government made pre-school for five- and six-year-olds free and
compulsory. However, local governments are responsible for education spending. Because of the
tight budget constraints faced by local authorities, the Government sought to ensure that the
funding of pre-primary school should be secured for five- and six-year-old children. This
measure was effective and enrollment rates for both five- and six- year olds remained stable in
2010 and 2011. By guaranteeing two years of pre-school, this measure prevented an entire cohort
from being less prepared for school. However, funding should be improved in the medium run to
improve overall access of children to pre-school, including three- and four-year-old children. The

64.    To accommodate the per capita financing reform, which led to a reduction in the number
of schools by 128 from 2008 to 2009, the Government subsidized transportation for the children
from closed schools. These transportation measures exceeded their targets in spite of a reduced
budget, reaching almost universal coverage or 97 percent of the children whose school closed.
65.     Total spending in social protection continued to grow quickly following the onset of the
economic crisis in Latvia (see Table 10). Old age spending, including pensions, accounted for
most of the growth. The rise in pensions was driven by the high notional interest rates applied to
pensions reflecting the lagged growth of the wage and benefit bill of the insured population, and
also by pre-crisis discretionary policy measures. Unemployment benefits also grew; pushed up
both by massive unemployment and the extension of the benefits coverage under the ESSNS.
Other categories such as sickness and family were reduced. Spending on GMI and WWS
emergency public works programs rose substantially over the period. GMI spending increased in
116 out of 117 municipalities between 2009 and 2011. Moreover, total social assistance spending
at the local level increased by 70 percent between 2009 and 2011 (see Figure 2). The state co-
financing of 50 percent of GMI and 20 percent of housing benefits was effective in preserving
local governments’ social assistance spending.

66.    Measures taken under the ESSNS mitigated the impact of the fiscal consolidation on
the poorest households. That the large increase in GMI spending occurred in the context of
substantial fiscal pressures to consolidate municipal budgets was a result of the provision of 50
percent co-financing by the central government. Additional funds for GMI were used to increase
the amount of the benefits and also to expand coverage, which increased from 22.8 percent in
2008 to 45.6 percent in 2011(if measured as the share of the people classified as needy who
received GMI at some point during 2011).

67.     Despite a limited budget, the SDPL series managed to support structural reforms that are
very likely to induce solid improvements in the medium-term in all three sectors. In addition, the
monitoring and evaluation process put in place for the ESSNS enhanced the independence and
the transparency of the governmental administrations involved.
68.     In health, the Government seized the opportunity of the fiscal consolidation to undertake
a major reform of the health care system, improving efficiency through a large shift from
inpatient to outpatient services (see Table 11). Between 2008 and 2010, half of the contracted
hospitals were either closed or their inpatient contract cancelled, thus being converted into daily
care centers. This allowed a reduction in the number of hospital beds by 28 percent during the
same period. The Government also improved the quality of the medical personnel by replacing
those with secondary education with nurses with higher education and assigned to primary care.
This allowed reinforcement of the general practices and improvement in their coverage through
an extension of their opening hours and by deploying a family physician advisory telephone
service. This service has been operating from May 1, 2011 from 7 p.m. to 8 a.m. on weekdays
and around the clock during weekends and holidays. This service has been receiving around
2,000 calls a month since its creation, but its usage increased to 5,913 calls a month by March
2012 after a public awareness campaign was carried out at the beginning of 2012. It is designed
to provide medical advice when general practitioner offices are closed, preventing unnecessary
hospital visits and providing good primary care advice during off hours.

69.     The health reforms were accompanied by an improvement in self-reported health status
following the onset of the crisis (see Figure 3). In addition, the infant mortality rate dropped from
8.7 to 5.7 per thousand live births between 2007 and 2010, a 65 percent drop; and the crude
death rate dropped from 14.5 to 13.4 per thousand even while hospitalizations dropped from 234

to 170 per thousand. This progress coincided with the reforms supported by SDPL series.
Although we cannot attribute cause and effect, despite the safety net for the poor and the
intended improvements to emergency services, it should be noted that there were strong fears in
2008-09 that the shift of emphasis from inpatient to outpatient care was an extremely risky
reform and would result in many additional deaths.

70.     In education, the margin for efficiency improvement was large on the eve of the crisis.
Latvia did not undertake major reforms to compensate for its rapidly declining student
population and unit costs grew by 38 percent in real terms between 2000 and 2009. Therefore,
efficiency was very low prior to the crisis with too many teaching staff and small schools.34 The
implementation of the per capita financing system allowed a reduction in the number of schools
by 124 in general education (a 13 percent decrease) and as a result of optimization by nine in
vocational education (a 10 percent decrease) between 2009 and 2011. The number of schools
continued its decline, although at a slower pace in 2012 in general education as the number of
schools decreased by four. In 2010/2011 the number of vocational education institutions has
been reduced from 54 to 38.
71.     The measures taken under the ESSNS to ensure transportation of students whose school
had closed to new schools prevented this rapid school consolidation from having an adverse
effect on access. Indeed, enrollment rates in general schools did not decrease from 2008 to 2011.
Moreover, the overall quality of education did not suffer, as average test scores tended to be
higher in 2009-2011 than before the crisis for grades 3 and 6, and similar for grade 9 (see Figure
4).35 In grade 12, the results clearly improved in language, but deteriorated in mathematics. At
the same time, inequalities in school performance neither grew nor declined. Moreover,
according to a statistics produced by the MoES, pupils’ performance in the schools that were
reorganized between 2009 and 2011 was maintained overall.36




34
   Pupil teacher ratios were as low as 10.1 in the secondary level.
35
   All students are tested in grades 3, 6, 9 and 12 in the Latvian language and Mathematics every year.
36
   These statistics give a comparison of average mathematics performance in ninth grade in a random selection of
half the schools that were reorganized between 2009 and 2011.

72.     In social protection, the diversion of the second pillar fund contributions to finance the
first pillar commitments reduced the long-term sustainability of the pensions system. From
January 2009, the contribution rate to the private pillar was reduced from eight percent of a
worker’s salary to two percent and diverted to fund the current social insurance budget. This
allowed for the partial closing of an unexpected funding gap in the pay-as-you-go system.
Indeed, following strict pension benefit calculation rules, newly-assigned pensions were growing
even after the growth in pension contribution revenues had turned negative. This further added to
pension spending in the short and medium term. While the second pillar contribution rate of
eight percent was consistent with economic prospects before the crisis, the rate was not
affordable following the onset of the crisis.
73.     Initially, in the first SDPL the Government committed to increase the second pillar
pension contribution rate to six percent on January 1, 2012. A six percent contribution rate, even
though less ambitious than the eight percent in existence prior to the crisis, was still considered
sizable and in line with what some of the other Eastern European countries have in place. But in
2010, the economic crisis was much deeper than expected. Therefore, in the second SDPL the
Government shifted its commitment to increase the contribution rate to six percent by one year to
January 1, 2013. Postponing this measure by one year was not unreasonable given the funding
gap in the pay-as-you-go system to be financed in the short-term. The drawback of this approach
was that it may have eroded some credibility in the Government's commitment to individual
pension savings accounts.
74.   The SAO report illustrated that the rapid expansion of spending on GMI benefits was
accompanied by problems in implementation regarding the targeting and the administration of

                                                                                            29
social assistance.37 The implementation of the action plan in response to the recommendations of
the SAO may have positive impacts on the efficiency of social assistance spending in the near
future. In addition, during this period, there remained a shortfall in the certification of those
eligible for ―needy‖ status by local governments. The percentage of persons eligible for needy
status that have been certified as needy has remained below the target of 50 percent.
75.     Finally, the process used for monitoring and evaluation has fostered government
transparency in implementing the policies supported by the SDPL series. First, an independent
audit of the ESSNS was completed on October 2011 by the SAO and published on the Internet.
The report underlined several weaknesses surrounding the targeting of social assistance. The
SAO’s recommendations led the Ministry of Welfare and other involved governmental agencies
to agree on an action plan that has been since implemented (see paragraph 35). Second, the
ESSNS has been monitored on a quarterly basis and the indicators tracked have been published
on the Internet, ensuring transparency on the implementation and results of the strategy.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
76.    The overall rating is satisfactory for both SDPLs. The rating reflects the high
relevance of the development objective, the relevance of the design and implementation and the
achievement of the program objective. All planned policy actions were implemented, although
one measure was postponed by one year and another one was reversed by the Constitutional
Court. The operation was well designed with a comprehensive set of prior policy actions
covering the three social sectors: health, education, and social protection. All the PDO
indicators reached or exceeded their set targets, although many intermediary outcomes were
not met as the targets set by the Government were overambitious given the brief time between
startup of the ESSNS and measurement of targets. Finally, the operation occurred in a
constrained fiscal environment, but still the Government honored its commitment to the ESSNS.
77.     Outcomes in the social sectors have continued to improve during the programs. In
Social Protection, first, the share of needy people in the total population remained consistently
below expectations, reaching 12.8 percent in 2011 compared to 7.9 percent in 2009. Second,
self-reported health status continued improving during 2010 for both males and females. Third,
neither enrollment nor performance dropped in the education sector, in spite of severe spending
and inputs adjustment. These positive trends underline that the program was protecting the
population, especially the most vulnerable households, from the effects of the economic
downturn and the fiscal consolidation.
78.    The targets set for the overall implementation were fully met on time, enabling: (i) an
adequate funding of the strategy, (ii) full transparency during implementation, and (iii) an


37
  The SAO’s evaluation identified three problems: (i) qualifying criteria not sufficiently clear, (ii) an incorrect
application of those criteria by the municipal social assistance offices, and (iii) insufficient or inadequate controls.


                                                          30
independent and relevant evaluation that led to improvements in the program. The extension of
most of the measures after the end of the World Bank’s financial support to the program is
further proof of the effectiveness and relevance of the ESSNS.
79.     In health, the results of the key PDO indicators exceeded the targets set. The number of
subsidized visits for: (i) inpatient, (ii) outpatient, (iii) home care, and (iv) mental care were
significantly higher than the targets set for 2010 and 2011. Moreover, at the closure of the SDPL,
the number of GP practices benefitting from an additional public health nurse reached 93 percent
of the target, providing 465 additional nurses to mitigate the negative risks of cutbacks to
inpatient care. The number of patients receiving 100 percent reimbursement of medicinal
products or medicines charges exceeded what was expected in 2011, with almost a half more
patients receiving reimbursements compared to targets (30,267 patients received reimbursements
versus the target of 22,000). One gap was that no day care centers were built although two
should have been according to the results framework. Demand for subsidized places in hotels for
hospital patients did not materialize as expected and so the target set for both 2010 and 2011
were missed. As noted in the Government’s response to this ICR, the Government will stop the
subsidy for hotel patients in 2012 and increase availability of day care and home care to provide
a more appropriate solution for these patients (such as dialysis patients or oncology patients that
previously had inpatient stays for their regular therapy), so it continues to execute the underlying
strategy. However, the number of needy patients who benefitted from home care and mental care
respectively exceeded the target set by 340 percent and 80 percent. This is evidence of the
Ministry of Health’s efficiency and being able to provide the needed care without additional
infrastructure. The overall health outcomes continued improving during the implementation of
the reform while inputs in the sector were drastically reduced and real spending was cut by 25
percent between 2008 and 2011. This shows that the SDPL series clearly had a very positive
impact on efficiency. Eventually, the numerous hospital38 closures represent a strong step toward
a medium-term rationalization of the health system. In the health sector, the program
achieved the three PDO objectives beyond expectations and is therefore rated Highly
Satisfactory.
80.     In education, all indicators met or exceeded their targets. However, because of a
Constitutional Court ruling, the measure promoting social diversity among beneficiaries of
higher education stipends was terminated. Although its temporary implementation led to some
short term gains for students of low socioeconomic background, this measure did not lay the
foundations for improvement in the medium-run. The indicators monitored showed that
enrollment of the five and six year olds did not suffer from the cut in funding. Finally, measures
taken for the transportation of students whose schools have closed were very successful and



38
  In most of the cases, the hospitals were not shut down but their operating contract was modified to make them
operate only on a daily basis as outpatient centers.


                                                      31
exceeded their targets in reducing excessive travel time. The outcomes in education are rated
Satisfactory.
81.     In social protection, all four key PDO indicators were met: (i) the extension of the
duration of unemployment benefits by nine months benefited more than 22 percent 39 of the
unemployment insurance beneficiaries, but the share of beneficiaries declined progressively; (ii)
the temporary diversion of the second pillar pension was halted; (iii) the State funded half of the
spending for the GMI; and (iv) the results exceeded the targets set for the public works program.
The evaluation of the public works WWS program showed that this measure was very effective
at mitigating economic shocks. Together with the extension of unemployment benefits and the
increase of the GMI, this measure allowed poverty to be contained during a very severe crisis
and in a tight fiscal environment as social assistance spending decreased by 6.8 percent between
2008 and 2010. The increase of the second pillar contribution and the implementation of the
action plan to better target the benefits to the needy constituted a solid step for the rationalization
of social protection in the medium run. However, as the coverage of both unemployment
insurance and GMI did not reach the set targets, outcomes in social protection are rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
82.     The operation was clearly intended to benefit the poor directly in terms of mitigating the
impacts on the poorest households from the economic crisis and the fiscal adjustment that
followed. The program increased the direct monetary support to the poorest households through
(i) a 70 percent increase of social assistance spending at the local level from 2009 to 2011, (ii)
more targeted direct transfers to the needy households due to GMI spending multiplied in real
terms more than threefold from 2009 to 2011, (iii) the extension of the duration of
unemployment benefits by nine months, and (iv) the provision of public works to those
unemployed who were not eligible for benefits.
83.     In the area of health care, the program clearly increased the financial coverage of the
poorest households. The strengthening of primary care allowed the subsidies coverage to be
extended to outpatient services. The exemption of low-income households from any health
copayments substantially reduced the financial burden of health care. As a result of the new
Ministry of Health direct subsidies system to the care providers and pharmacies, low-income
households did not need to pay upfront for care and benefited from free services. Under the
previous system they had to pay first, then seek reimbursement from local authorities. In
addition, the switch from in-patient toward more out-patient visits is likely to have contributed to
better health outcomes by expanding preventive care.



39
     The target of 22 percent was met except throughout 2010-2011 except in the last quarter of 2011.


                                                           32
84.    In the education sector, the program interventions were clearly targeted to the poorest and
most vulnerable and therefore were able to mitigate the impact of school and fiscal
consolidation.
85.     The project design did not incorporate or intend to have specific impacts on gender,
environment or social development. Government data did not disaggregate the impact by gender.
Simulations made by World Bank staff showed that the impact of the crisis may have been
similar on both males and females.40
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
86.     The SDPL series had a positive impact on the Latvian institutional environment, by
laying the foundations for medium-term change. The intense policy dialogue supported by
several technical assistance outputs that accompanied the SDPL series helped institutional
strengthening, especially by: (i) clarifying and improving the efficiency of the social assistance
administration at the local level,41 (ii) supporting the creation of a centrally operated health care
safety net for the needy, (iii) supporting local authorities in organizing transport for the students.
Furthermore, the program promoted transparency of the Government’s institutions in the
implementation of reforms, through (i) regular monitoring of the Safety Net Strategy and the
quarterly release of the monitoring indicators to the general public on the internet and (ii) an
independent audit of the ESSNS by the SAO, whose results were also disclosed on the internet.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
Macroeconomic risk:
89.     The macroeconomic risk is moderate. The economic recovery was faster and stronger
than initially expected. Real GDP growth has been positive and accelerating since the second
half of 2010. The authorities’ commitment to maintaining the exchange rate peg to the Euro
involved achieving substantial wage and price cuts combined with a growth in productivity with
the aim of improving competitiveness and reducing external imbalances. This entailed costs in
terms of increased unemployment, which reached a peak of 20.7 percent in 2010. As the

   Thanks for instance to the numerous recommendations of the SAO about the way municipalities determine the
eligibility of needy households to social assistance.

economy recovers, unemployment has been decreasing, albeit slowly, and it still remains high at
above 14 percent at end-December 2011. Inflation has fallen from previous peaks and is
expected to continue to decline as international food and energy prices fall further. The large
fiscal adjustment is expected to result in a 2012 fiscal deficit of 2.1 percent of GDP (ESA95),
below the fiscal deficit ceiling of three percent according to Maastricht criteria. The financial
sector has strengthened as indicated by an improvement in prudential indicators for the banking
sector. Deposits are now above pre-crisis levels.
90.     The EU-IMF stabilization program concluded at end-2011. The Government of Latvia
successfully completed the Fifth Review under the Stand-By Arrangement and the financing
assurances review on December 21, 2011. The IMF Staff Report concluded that Latvia’s
program had achieved many of its objectives given that international reserves had recovered to
pre-crisis levels, the exchange rate peg was maintained, the financial sector strengthened,
competitiveness improved, and a large fiscal consolidation achieved bringing the country on
track to meet the Maastricht fiscal criterion in 2012.42 However, IMF staff noted the cost of the
adjustment in terms of high unemployment and poverty, and cautioned on a number of
unresolved vulnerabilities, namely the increased external debt ratio entailing short-term
financing requirements and the high share of non-performing loans in the banking sector that will
continue to constrain credit availability and domestic demand.
91.      The improvement of economic conditions has been reflected in ratings upgrades and
facilitated the placement of a Eurobond in June 2011. In 2012, Latvia received a further upgrade
to investment grade from all three credit rating agencies. Nevertheless, the worsening global
outlook is likely to impact adversely on growth in 2012 and the euro area debt crisis may
constrain the availability of funding from international capital markets.

Political risk:
92.     The political risk is moderate. Although the Prime Minister Dombrovskis’s party, Unity,
lost seats in the Parliament in the September 2011 elections, the Prime Minister formed a
coalition with the Reform Party and National Alliance and remains in power for a third term.
This has helped ensure the continuity of the fiscal and structural reforms, including those
undertaken in the social sectors.

Government ownership/commitment risk:
93.   The risk is moderate. Throughout the crisis and the reform program that followed, the
Government exhibited strong ownership and a commitment to reforms. Although examples from

other countries are not favorable,43 the Government has shown its commitment to reverse the
decrease of the contribution rate to the second pillar pensions at the beginning of 2013. Finally,
the Government’s continued collaboration with the World Bank on how to combat long-term
unemployment and labor market inactivity is an additional sign that they are willing to build on
short-term measures taken in response to the crisis and build on these measures to put in place
sustainable reforms.
94.      However, the Government does face a considerable challenge in continuing with
structural reforms, particularly as the fiscal situation eases and political pressures for spending
increases emerge. The country managed to implement large reforms in a short time, but the
structural reforms to be tackled in the coming years remain large in health, education, and social
protection. In the health sector, the country has achieved a major shift to a better mix of inpatient
and outpatient services while also lowering costs as a consequence. The potential gains from this
strategy are far from exhausted. However, as the hospitals that were closed or converted into day
care centers remain under the management of local authorities, there is still a risk that such
facilities might be reopened or reconverted back to inpatient care centers in the future, especially
if economic growth were to accelerate. The school network consolidation that was achieved
during the crisis remains insufficient to compensate for the past decline in student population.
Further adjustment will be needed as the enrolled population will continue to shrink in the
coming decades. To these quantitative changes there is a need to further develop and improve
both pre-primary and higher education. In both these areas, education spending remains critical,
not only to foster growth in the long-term, but also to attract and retain the young workers that
the country need to finance its social system. Public spending in higher education remains very
low in Latvia, as per student spending represents only 58 percent of what the older EU member
states spend. 44 Finally, it is to be noted that the diversion of the funded pillar contributions to the
public scheme, even temporarily, is likely to result in lower pensions for future retirees.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
95.    The performance of both project teams during identification, preparation, and appraisal is
rated satisfactory. First, the SDPL series supports the Government’s Employment and Social
Safety Net Strategy, approved on October 1, 2009. The SDPL was been accompanied by an
extensive and timely technical assistance program to help the Government in the design and
monitoring of the ESSNS. The components of the SDPL series were designed in accordance with

the findings of a very detailed PER undertaken by the World Bank in 2007 and updated in 2010,
which examined options for fiscal consolidation and structural reforms in the social sectors and
public administration. The design of the SDPL series also benefitted from the collaboration with
the EC, the IMF, and other international donors allowing the policy actions to be aligned with the
reform program covering the financial sector supported by the Government’s partners.
Moreover, the SDPL series supplemented a Financial Sector DPL that was disbursed by the
World Bank in 2010 to support the financial stabilization of the country after the 2008-2009
crisis. In addition, the World Bank team has accompanied government consultations with non-
government organizations representing constituents affected by the fiscal consolidation and
structural reforms.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
96.     The operation was well supervised. Both operations were delivered on time, all prior
actions were met allowing the second SDPL to start quickly and both disbursements occurred
within the year. The two operations were also closed on schedule, at the end of fiscal years 2010
for the first loan and 2011 for the second.
97.     The two SDPL series teams consisted of social sector economists, most of whom
participated in the design and supervision of both SDPLs, which guaranteed consistency across
the two phases of the program. Additionally, team members were involved in the update of the
social sectors PER so that the supervision of the program benefited from their up to date
knowledge of the details of expenditure in each sector. The dialogue with the Government during
the program was continuous, allowing adjustments to the programs in response to the rapid
changes in the economic prospects of Latvia from 2009 through 2011. The quality of the
technical capacity of the World Bank team has been acknowledged by the Government, which
now wishes to continue receiving technical assistance from the World Bank team on a FBS, in
order to motivate reforms to policies targeted at the long-term unemployed and inactive in
Latvia.
98.    In addition, both teams were dedicated to liaison and collaboration with the IMF and the
EC to ensure the communication consistency with the Government, to adjust the design of the
program to the structural reforms that were supported by the other donors, and to share data and
evaluations on the implementation of the SDPL series.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
99.     Overall, the World Bank team was well prepared and provided timely and relevant policy
advice under the operations. The program benefitted from the expertise of the team, allowing the
design, implementation, and monitoring of relevant and quantifiable results.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

                                               36
100. Performance of the Borrower during the preparation phase was satisfactory. Government
bodies involved in the SDPL series included the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Welfare,
Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Transportation, and the
Ministry of Regional Development and Local Government. 45 Other government agencies
participating were the Local Governments Association and state limited liability company ―The
Road Transport Administration‖, which were all involved in the SDPL series dialogue from the
beginning.
101. The preparation and implementation of the SDPL series was facilitated by the strong
commitment of the Government to push for reforms in the social sector. The ownership of the
Government was a key factor of the success of the SDPL series from the start. Although the
sector ministers changed during the program, the continuity of commitment to the program was
ensured as the current Prime Minister remained in office throughout the program.
102. The Government also consulted with a large number of non-governmental organizations
and civil society organizations on the content and implementation of the reforms. It is to be noted
that the Government ensured transparency around the design and implementation of the ESSNS,
first, by allowing the SAO to perform an independent audit of the Strategy, and second, by
closely monitoring the results of the program and disclosing the related information to the public
on the internet on a quarterly basis. All line ministries also published budget, strategy and
monitoring documents on their webpage as well as details of consultations with stakeholders.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

   Implementing Agency         Performance                                    Comments
1. Ministry of Finance          Satisfactory     The Ministry of Finance was in charge of the overall funding and
                                                 the coordination of the SDPL series. All operations and prior
                                                 conditions were met on time, and adequate and timely funding
                                                 was allocated to the ESSNS.
2. Ministry of Welfare          Satisfactory     The Ministry of Welfare was responsible for the implementation
                                                 of the Social Protection measures, along with the local
                                                 authorities. All measures were implemented in time.
                                                 It also had responsibility for monitoring the implementation of
                                                 the ESSNS starting January 1, 2011. This monitoring was highly
                                                 satisfactory.
3. Ministry of Education and    Satisfactory     The Ministry of Education and Science implemented enormous
Science                                          changes, such as per capita financing and creating incentives for
                                                 localities to make tough allocation decisions in education, against
                                                 strong opposition. However, consolidation of the school network
                                                 has slowed down after this upfront adjustment. The role of the
                                                 Ministry in the implementation of the education measures was
                                                 limited as the local authorities are in charge of managing the
                                                 funds for pre-primary education. The transportation measures to

                                           Development). The Ministry of Education and Science was in
                                           charge of managing the ESSNS funds put aside to improve the
                                           curriculum and materials for pre-primary and primary schools.
4. Ministry of Health         Highly       The Ministry was responsible for the implementation of the
                            Satisfactory   measures in the health sector. Among all of the ministries, it was
                                           quickest to respond to the opportunity for structural reforms and
                                           considered the safety net an integral part of its reform program.
                                           Once the reforms were agreed, it also pursued them relentlessly
                                           and effectively. Initially surprised by the slow take-up of the
                                           program, the Ministry reacted fast by reallocating available funds
                                           along the way to pro-poor measures such as dropping the
                                           deductible for covered pharmaceuticals or by fully covering the
                                           cost of hospital treatment (not just the co-payments) for the poor.
                                           As is clear in the response of the government to this ICR, the
                                           MOH continues to develop the programs initiated during this
                                           crisis period because they were part of a larger strategy.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
103. The Government owned the reform agenda from the start through playing a leading role
in the design of the Social Sector Strategy. It managed to implement politically sensitive reforms,
such as the consolidation of the schools and hospitals networks, in a tough economic
environment.

6. Lessons Learned
104. Prioritizing and making trade-offs in social sector spending enabled the
Government to take advantage of the need for consolidation to improve the long-term
efficiency of public services. Although the government implemented across-the-board cuts in
2009, it also took the opportunity to target structural reforms with the high efficiency gains over
the longer term, particularly in education and health. It also developed a successful set of
emergency safety net measures that staved off disaster for the most vulnerable members of

                                                 38
society and gave the government experience in how such countercyclical programs can operate.
These choices may have been necessitated by the depth of the crisis and a national consensus
around the necessity to prepare for the adoption of the Euro, but the safety net may also have
contributed to the government’s ability to maintain the consensus and to be reelected to office
midway through the crisis. As social spending was relatively low as a share of GDP in Latvia,
with coverage gaps in education, health, and social protection prior to the crisis, large cuts in
these sectors were extremely risky. Nevertheless, improving the quality of expenditure and
developing the safety net allowed some of the worst gaps to be reduced despite the lower
spending.
105. Regular reviews of spending and outcomes in the social sectors enabled the program
to be tailored and implemented very rapidly. In Latvia, the comprehensive spending review
undertaken jointly by the World Bank and IMF allowed the Government to rapidly design a
relevant program to respond to the crisis. An important lesson from Latvia was that investing in
economic and social data analysis in good times and on a regular basis is all the more relevant in
a time of crisis, especially given that the cost of such practice remains low.
106. The World Bank’s support through the SDPL series provided a framework for the
Government’s policy reforms in the social sectors during a time of deep fiscal cuts. While
the financial resources from the SDPL series were utilized by the Government, other available
international and bilateral financing resources were not drawn upon. Hence, the Government did
not face a large financing gap on the fiscal side and, in this regard, the SDPL series played a
limited role in assisting the Government. The value of the SDPL series was the World Bank
engagement it entailed in providing technical assistance on implementing the emergency safety
net measures and in placing fiscal cuts and emergency measures in the context of the wider
structural reform agenda in education, health, and social protection.
107. Reforming social insurance, especially pensions, during a crisis is very difficult. The
reform experience in Latvia has shown that pension expenditures exhibit very high inertia in
times of recessions and even extremely reform-minded governments are not able to quickly
reduce spending on such programs. Pension spending actually increased by 27 percent in real
terms over 2008-2010. Although the Constitutional Court ruling about the pension reform was
very specific and related to the lack of consultation on allowing cuts in pensions, the
Government did not pursue their proposed reform.
108. Reforming the social sectors during good times creates fiscal space to react during
economic downturns. Contrary to Latvia, some countries among the EU12 started earlier to
implement policies aiming at counteracting the demographic decline, which is large and certain:
per capita financing and school consolidation in education, improved targeting of social
assistance, increased retirement age, hospital consolidation and increased focus on primary care
provision, among others. Taking early steps: (i) allows limiting the cuts needed when a crisis
occurs as poorly targeted social insurance expenditure can boom during economic contraction,
(ii) accelerates fiscal consolidation as structural reforms consume time and political capital

                                               39
before actually providing fiscal savings, (iii) provides fiscal space through deficit and debt
reduction allowing for counter-cyclical policy through discretionary policies, and (iv) prevents
massive lay-offs of public workers at a time of crisis when increased unemployment would
command the exact opposite policy.
109. Budget rules should take into account economic cycles. It is important to consider the
trajectory of social protection expenditures—particularly unemployment benefits and social
safety net support programs—across the economic cycle in designing fiscal rules and buffer-
stock savings mechanisms.
110. Targets should not be overly-ambitious in projects designed during a period of high
uncertainty. That certain intermediate targets were not met in health and social assistance
suggests that the targets were overambitious given the fiscal space and the pace of
implementation of health reforms. These targets were based on tentative projections, which
happened to be too optimistic as often baseline data was not available. Setting such specific
targets at the beginning of the program was risky given the context of large uncertainty as: (i) the
project was implemented in the midst of a severe economic crisis which triggered a larger than
expected fiscal contraction; and (ii) interventions were both new and never piloted before or
involved the large scaling up from small programs. In such an environment, the targets for the
outputs should have been defined as absolute figures, not as ratios, and using more conservative
projections.

Annex 2. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and Comments


General Comments
The Safety Net and Social Sector Reform Program First Development Policy Loan (hereinafter -
First Social DPL) entered into force on March 12, 2010. The Safety Net and Social Sector
Reform Program Second Development Policy Loan (hereinafter - Second Social DPL) entered
into force on June 17, 2011. Both were part of an international financial support package of EUR
7.5 billion.
Their objectives were to protect vulnerable groups with emergency safety net support during the
economic contraction and fiscal consolidation measures and to ensure that structural reforms lay
a foundation for medium-term improvements in the social sector. In this regard, the Government
approved the Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy, which came into the force on October 1,
2009.
The reforms were implemented by the Ministry of Finance (MoF), the Ministry of Welfare
(MoW), the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES), the Ministry of Health (MoH), the
Ministry of Transport (MoT), the Ministry of Regional Development and Local Governments
(MoRDLG), which was restructured in the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional
Development (MoEPRD) on January 1, 2011, as well as the Local Governments Association and
the state limited liability company ―The Road Transport Administration‖.
Activities to strengthen the social safety nets
To deal with rising unemployment and a deteriorated social situation, the Government of the
Republic of Latvia in its meeting on September 8, 2009 approved a Social Safety Net Strategy
(hereinafter – the Strategy). Its purpose was to develop a batch of safety net measures to mitigate
adverse effects resulting from: (1) the financial and economic crisis and (2) the structural reforms
realized. We were committed to implement the social safety net activities into four areas:
welfare, education, health and transportation. The Strategy was to begin on October 1, 2009 and
to end on December 31, 2011, but could be extended if: (1) the situation in the social sector was
to worsen by the end of 2011 or (2) the context in which the Strategy was implemented was to
change considerably. The extension of the Strategy measures in 2012 was discussed by the
Cabinet of Ministers in early November 2011, who decided to pursue the implementation of the
measures in welfare, health and transportation. A further extension of the Strategy measures in
2013 will be discussed during the preparation process of the State Budget for 2013.
Social safety net activities in the welfare domain
   - Municipal social assistance
The GMI level was increased as of October 1, 2009, setting its level at LVL 45 per child and
LVL 40 per adult per month. Moreover, in 2010, the criteria of eligibility of the status of needy
person were change and some restrictions were removed.


                                                  43
The number of persons certified as needy increased from 176.1 thousands (7.8% of the
population) in 2009 to 282.1 thousands (12.5% of pop.) in 2010 but decreased to 265.3 48
thousands (12.8% of pop.) in 2011. The total number of GMI benefit receivers increased from
62.8 thousands (2.8% of total population) in 2009 to 120.6 thousands (5.4% of total population)
in 2010 and after- decreased to 121.8 thousands (5.9% of total population) in 2011. Although it
was forecasted that the number of needy persons and GMI receivers will continue to increase in
2011, reports from municipalities show that those statistics started decreasing in 2011.
As local government revenue seemed still insufficient to finance GMI and housing benefits, the
state co-financed 50% of the GMI benefits and 20% of the housing benefit from 2009 until the
end of 2011. As a result, the municipal spending for social assistance increased 49 from 31.1
million LVL in 2008 up to 45.4 million LVL in 2010 and to 52.7 million LVL in 2011. The
government decided to prolong the state co-financing of the GMI until the end of 2012 and of the
housing benefit until the end of April 2012.
To improve social assistance targeting and reduce poverty traps, the Ministry of Welfare has
started working on a comprehensive reform of social assistance and social support system which
will come into force in 2013.
       -   Unemployment insurance
From July 1, 2009 the period during which unemployment benefits were paid was extended to
nine month on a temporary basis. In addition, for persons with less than 20 years of insurance
record, unemployment benefit was set to a fixed amount equalling 45 LVL per month. In 2010
extended unemployment benefit were granted and paid to 17,008 persons in average per month
or 28.2% from the total number of unemployment benefit receivers. This percentage decreased to
22% in 2011. This decrease was influenced by the overall decrease of unemployment benefit
receivers among the total number of registered unemployed persons.
In 2010 the average duration of unemployment benefit payment was 5.32 months, which is
approximately 60% from the period of unemployment benefit payment prescribed in the
legislation, i.e. 9 months. This represents an increase by 0.88 months from 2009. In 2011 this
duration decreased to 4.82 months (54% of the maximum legal). The extension of the
unemployment benefit payment period ceased at the end of 2011.
       -   Workplace with Stipend Emergency Public Works (WWS) program
        The Workplaces with Stipend program (WWS) has been managed by the State
Employment Agency (SEA) and implemented by municipalities that were responsible for
creating the workplaces. The stipend amounted to LVL 100 per month, although in the second
half of 2011, in order to ensure a gradual transition to long-term measures and lower a financial
attractiveness of the measure, the amount of the stipend was reduced till 80 LVL, thus

48
     The 2011 data are estimates.
49
     The source of data is the Annual statistical reports of municipality.


                                                             44
motivating the unemployed to search for a job and return to the labour market or to decide to
take part in other active labour market measures. In total, 74,037 unemployed people took part in
the WWS program during its implementation while 122,937 participations positions were created
(45% of the beneficiaries participated more than once). 21.6% of all the participants were able to
find a job within 6 months after leaving the WWS program.
A new public works program has been launched taking into account the results of the impact
evaluation of the WWS program. Its main features are: non-commercial lower qualified activities
(state and municipal enterprises exempted from participation), the allowance is 100 LVL net per
month, the non-allowance costs have to be covered by municipalities (including equipment,
materials), two days per month (allowance not suspended) can be used for active job-search (if
afterwards evidence is submitted of this) or short courses organized by the State Employment
Agency. The general target mechanism is self-selecting (first-come first-served); municipalities
have the right to set clear and non-discriminatory priority criteria if necessary, the maximum
participation period is 4 months.
With work creation remaining slow, in the private sector, especially for lower qualified jobs,
priority will be given to improved and better targeted wage subsidy programs in the private
sector to reduce the risks of replacement of existing employees and to channel the available
resources to those most in need of assistance rather than to those who can find a new job without
or with little assistance from the State Employment Agency. Wage subsidy schemes are under
review. Matching and profiling activities of unemployed will be further developed at the SEA.
Discussions are in progress to assess the needs and possibilities of organizing services to assist
the inactive who cannot participate because of dependants, regional mobility or alcohol and drug
addiction.
   -   Second Pillar Pension Policy
The Government has completed a concept paper on the long-run sustainability of social security
forming the basis for a comprehensive pension reform. The Government reiterates its
commitment to restore the contribution rate to the second pillar pension to 6% by 2013, if the
budgetary situation improves as planned.
Social safety net activities in education
As of September 1, 2009, local governments did not have the resources to ensure pre-school
education for five- and six-year-old children, the state covered through the strategy the cost of
such mandatory free of charge pre-school education. Pre-school attendance rates have been
maintained over the crisis, equalling 94% for five-year-old children and 97% for six-year-old
children at the end of 2011.
Simultaneously, efficient per capita financing reforms allowed reducing the financial burden.
The financing has also been provided for the on-going improvement of the curriculum for pupils
of age five to ten years. The Ministry of Education and Science has continued reforms that lead
to efficiency and quality gains in education system and provided sufficient state subsidy for pre-
school education in 2012.

                                               45
Education system reform has led to school network optimization. During the period from 2009 to
2011, 77 schools were confirmed to be closed, 130 were reorganized and 14 new schools were
founded. According to the data received from the Ministry of Education and Science in
2011/2012 school year 31 schools were closed or reorganized.
To mitigate the effects of school closure, each local government has evaluated the possibilities
and costs of transporting students to schools. Four different methods have been used to assist in
the transportation of children: (1) purchase of school buses; (2) compensation of fares in public
transportation, (3) compensation of transportation expenditure of local governments, or (4)
purchase of transportation services from private providers. 209 school busses were purchased
and delivered to 88 local governments.
In 2010, 76% of students from reorganized and closed schools received transportation assistance,
but this proportion increased to 88% in the 4th Quarter of 2010 and reached 91% in 2011. The
time spent travelling to and from school exceeded 60 minutes (one way) for only 0.46% of the
students in 2010 and 0.38% in 2011. From 2012 transportation of relocated is financed from the
local government budget.
The government added into the regulation of Cabinet of Ministers No. 740 related to the
awarding of student’s stipends, social considerations, in addition to merit by issuing the
Regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 511 dated June 2, 2009. In accordance with the
Constitutional court decision on August 9, 2011 the regulation on stipends was amended to
prescribe that if two or more students have equivalent academic performance, the stipend first
shall be granted to the persons who conforms to certain criteria, taking into account person`s
social, family and financial situation.
Social safety net activities in health
Prior to October 1, 2009 patients who were certified as needy paid only 50% of the patient co-
payments for health care visits. In 2010, needy patients were exempted from co-payments and
from the second semester of 2010 payments were expanded to cover the entire cost of the
provided service and not uniquely the co-payment. The full subsidies for the needy patients in
outpatient and inpatient health care will remain in effect in 2012. These measures will be
financed from the general health care budget.
From February 3, 2010, the 50 LVL co-payments for medicine and medical devices have also
been lifted for the patients whose per capita income did not exceed 120 LVL. In 2011 those
compensations benefitted 30,267 patients. This measure is effective in 2012.
Starting from January 1, 2012 expenses for hotel-type beds in hospitals will not be covered for
needy and low-income persons anymore. Instead, free home care services are expanded: the
chronically ill patients are treated at home, thus decreasing the need for in-patient and emergency
care.
Community-based mental health care has been developed in day care centers. This allows a more
efficient use of resources by reducing the need of inpatient services and by taking care of patients

with mental disability closer to their living place ensures their integration in the society and
decreases stigmatization.
To alleviate the workload of general practitioners that resulted from the shift from in-patient to
out-patient medical care, additional nurses have been hired covering approximately half of the
primary health care practices. From the second semester of 2010, nurses were recruited for
family doctors’ practices in cities as well.
In 2010, a physician advisory telephone service was developed, to connect patients to a doctor
after working hours and on weekends. This method extends the access to primary care services
24 hours a day across the country at a low cost. It is aimed at the chronically ill and emergency
situation. Implementation started in the second quarter of 2011.
Mental health care in day centers, home care, the additional nurses in family doctor’s practice
and the physician advisory telephone service will be financed beyond 2011.
Social safety net activities in the transportation domain
The Regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 872 ―Regulations on Passenger Categories to
which Reduced Tariffs are Extended when Using Public Transport Services in the Rout Network‖
determines the categories of passengers, who have right to use public transport free of charge
along regional intercity, regional local and urban routes. The said categories of persons are: (a)
children of preschool age, (b) orphans and children without parental care, (c) first and second
group of disabled persons, children with disabilities and persons who accompany first group
disabled persons or disabled children, (d) politically repressed persons and members of National
resistance movement.
The Law on Disability defines that disabled persons with serious disabilities have the right to use
free of charge all types of public transport in the territory of Latvia, except taxi services, aviation
transport and transport of inland waterways.
The passenger categories that are foreseen in the regulation do not pay for tickets in the public
transport and they can utilise the said benefit by presenting special identity cards. The providers
of the public transportation in accordance with the normative acts that regulate public transport
services are entitled to claim the incurred losses from providing the aforementioned service from
the state budget. Compensation of the said losses is foreseen as one of the activities of the
strengthened social safety net for 2010 and 2011 to foster free movement of the said socially
vulnerable groups of people.
Road Transport Administration has summarized the information about passengers carried free of
charge in regional intercity, regional local and urban routes and caused losses to public transport
service providers in the year of 2011. The total sum of losses is calculated according to real
losses monitoring the number of voyages of all the categories of passengers with fare reliefs in
public transport. The total amount of financing assigned in the Strategy to public transport


                                                  47
service providers was 10.8 million LVL in 2011 and it covered 98 per cent of losses to public
transport service providers in regional intercity, regional local and in urban route network.
The largest group of passengers carried with fare reliefs in public transport was disabled persons
of the first and second group of disability (60 per cent). According to statistics the number of
voyages of disabled persons increased. In 2011 the number of passengers carried has increased
for 3 per cent in regional intercity and regional local traffic, but in city traffic increase was 16 per
cent in comparison to year 2010. Explanation is that in first half-year of 2010 there was not in
place precise passenger registration in republic city transport.

Monitoring and implementation of the social safety net activities
The Government of the Republic of Latvia designated the Ministry of Regional Development
and Local Governments as the institution responsible for monitoring of the Strategy
implementation. Due to the reorganization of central government ministries the Ministry of
Welfare was responsible for the supervision and co-ordination of the Strategy implementation
starting from January 1, 2011. Monitoring reports were submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers
every quarter.
The responsible institutions carried out the assessment of the Strategy’s activities and the
proposals concerning the Strategy measures continuation in 2012. This evaluation was discussed
in the meeting of Cabinet of Ministers on November 2011.
The Government of the Republic of Latvia highly appreciated the help and support of the World
Bank in mitigating the impact of the financial and economic crisis and the structural reforms on
the most vulnerable part of society.
We are very happy that in June 2010 we have been honoured by the award from the World Bank
for achieving outstanding results in improving lives of people in Europe and Central Asia.
