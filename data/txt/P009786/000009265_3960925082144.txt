MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on India
Madhva Pradesh Major Irriaation Proiect (Credit 1177-IN)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on India -
Madhya Pradesh Major Irrigation Project (Credit 1 1 77-IN)" prepared by the FAO/CP and the
South Asia Regional Office, with Part II contributed by the Borrower. The Report provides
an accurate account of project implementation. Benefits and operational costs, however,
deserve close scrutiny.
The project did not succeed in collapsing the time needed to complete major
irrigation structures as well as minor distributaries. In the absence of special institutional
arrangements the physical objectives were reached over ten years, instead of the five
years originally provided for. Accordingly, the PCR reestimates the rate of return at 1 5
percent, instead of 21 percent estimated at appraisal. The revised estimate may,
however, be optimistic. It hinges on effective operation and maintenance and on the
replication, over a wide area, of higher yields than estimated at appraisal. Follow-up action
is needed to secure adequate maintenance funding and effective support services.
On balance, the project is rated as satisfactory and sustainability as uncertain.
An audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
MADHYA PRADESH MAJOR IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Credit 1177-IN)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Madhya Pradesh Irrigation Project for
which an IDA Credit of SDR195.2 million (Credit 1177-IN) was approved in September 1981. The
credit closed on June 30, 1991, four years behind schedule. The final disbursement from the credit was
made on October 28, 1991. The undisbursed balance of SDR29.7 million (US$40.6 million equivalent)
was cancelled. All US$ amounts presented in this report are expressed as US$ equivalent.
Parts I (Project Review from the Bank's Perspective) and III (Statistical Information) were
prepared by an FAO/CP project completion mission which visited India in November/December 1991.
In March 1992, the Government of Madhya Pradesh was requested to comment on Parts I and III and
to prepare Part II (Project Review from the Borrower's Perspective).  The two Chief Engineers
responsible for executing the two major project components have commented on Parts I and III, but this
is the only content of Part II that has been received.
The preparation of this PCR was based inter alia on the Staff Appraisal Report, the legal
documents, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, internal Bank
memoranda, relevant Bank reports on the sector, and discussions with the Borrower's project staff and
the Bank's project staff in the New Delhi Office.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
MADHYA PRADESH MAJOR IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Credit 1177-IN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectivea
1.    The objectives of the project (which is a five-year time slice of a 20-year program
superimposed on elderly existing run-of-river schemes) were to complete the planned and partly
built reservoirs in Mahanadi Reservoir Project and Hasdeo Bango Project, and to extend and
modernize the irrigation conveyance system to meet optimal water requirements and enhance
efficiency of operation for mainly paddy cultivation.
Implementation Experience
2.    The project implementation closely followed the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) with
regard to components, but some of the components were increased in content during implemen-
tation. Due to the depreciation in the value of the rupee in terms of the US dollar and the Special
Drawing Rights (SDR), expenditure in rupees corresponded to less in dollars and SDR than
estimated in the SAR. In order to use some of the excess credit made available by the
depreciation, the scope of the project was changed to increase the area to be remodelled to
213,000 ha from the original 154,000 ha. The most critical deviation between planned and actual
implementation was the failure to develop the main canal system in tandem with the minor
canalization. The Government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP) also had difficulty in posting
sufficient staff to the project (a risk identified at appraisal), and of retaining senior engineers in
their posts. The project has taken ten years to nearly fulfill the original five-year program. As of
28 October 1991 (the date of final disbursement), about 85% of the original credit amount of
SDR195.2 million had been disbursed. The undisbursed balance of SDR 29.7 million was
cancelled.
Results
3.    The project achieved most of its objectives in terms of components built. However, it is
too early to judge properly the improvement of operation and maintenance and hence the benefits
in terms of increased yield. These benefits only started in the Mahanadi Reservoir Project in
1986/87 and in the Hasdeo Bango Dam Project in 1990/91. However, farming research and
monitoring have indicated that higher yields are being obtained than estimated in the SAR.1 The
results of the delays in project implementation reduced the economic rate of return (ERR) from
the appraisal estimate of 21% to 15%. This variation is smaller than might have been expected,
due to yield levels being slightly higher than estimated at appraisal.
4.    At full development, the annual production of food crops is estimated to increase by
1,254,000 tons of paddy (SAR 975,000 tons), 237,000 tons of other grains (SAR 184,000
tons), 1,071,000 tons of sugarcane (SAR 1,071,000 tons) and about 41,000 tons of groundnut.
Net farm incomes are estimated to increase by about 160% due to the project.

Agriculture University.

Sustainability
5.    Given efficient continuing operation and maintenance (O&M), the benefits generated by
the project's irrigation components are likely to increase and then be maintained during the
economic life of the project. However, the sustainability of the project will be greatly in jeopardy
unless two conditions are fulfilled: sufficient funds, based on actual requirements, are made
available for O&M;2 and the unlined sub-chak field canals are kept operational.
6.    Also, a gradual decline in the efficiency and conditions of canal lining over the years is
inevitable and it is anticipated that, even with effective O&M, most of the lining will require
replacement in about 40 years time.
Findings and Lessons Learned
7.    Findings. The project, viewed overall, was reasonably well prepared. The project
concept was sound and the roles and responsibilities of the main agencies concerned were clearly
defined and understood. The project has met its implementation targets, although with significant
delays. With only a limited proportion of developed area now switched from 'protective'
irrigation to the more efficient demand driven basis (Mahanadi Reservoir Project 4,700 ha,
Hasdeo Bango Project 9,000 ha), it is difficult to estimate project benefits in terms of output.
However, on the basis of the small areas which have been switched, the future looks most
promising and, if adequate funding is available for efficient continuing operation and
maintenance, the benefits generated by the project should be maintained throughout its economic
life.
8.    Lessons Learned. The main lessons of experience for the Bank are: (a) consulting
contracts should be in a final state for signature prior to credit effectiveness; (b) all significant
designs for the first two years construction should be complete by appraisal; (c) assurances of
counterpart funding and resource availability should be closely examined to avoid eventual
problems which cause implementation delays; (d) the ability of an engineering organization as in
India to integrate all aspects of an irrigation project, so as to obtain optimally phased development
of productive irnigation, is doubtful when the project document has optimistic construction targets
and the project organization has to abide by public sector regulations; and (e) realistic budgets
must be provided for O&M, if an irrigation project is to be sustainable. As for the Borrower, the
main lesson is that every effort should be made to ensure continuity of senior staff to maintain a
cohesive 'project team'.
2     At present, an average of Rs.80/ha/year is expended on O&M. Project engineers
at the Mahanadi Reservoir Project and the Hasdeo Bango Dam Project consider effective O&M
for sustainable operation requires Rs. 150/ha/year. However, O&M funding allocation should be
based on actual requirements.

2. Background
2.1   The development objectives of the Government of India (GOI) at the time of project
formulation included major emphasis on irrigation, energy and infrastructure. Investment in
irrigation had, by this time, switched from concentration on main and branch canal conveyance
with minor distribution being left to farmers, to projects which acknowledged the need for
integrated major canal irrigation with the development of minor canalization and associated
command area development. Such funding supported improved efficiency in system operation to
ensure reliable supplies of water to farmers -- a prerequisite for efficient irrigation and economic
projects.
2.2   Organization of irrigation commands at minor canal level had become, in many cases, the
responsibility of Command Area Development Authorities (CADA). A main function of CADA
was to coordinate activities of the State Agriculture and Irrigation Departments. Experience in the
1970s had shown that: (a) more emphasis was required on improving the efficiency and
reliability of the canal system from source to irrigation outlet; (b) Government should accept
greater responsibility for supplying water to an outlet close to individual landholding, to assist in
construction of water courses conveying water to each field; (c) development of this
micro-distribution system should proceed in blocks, in tandem with main supply works, to allow
benefit to be obtained as soon as possible during the implementation process. These concepts
were used in the project design.
3. Project Objectives and Description
3.1   The main objective of the project was to increase agricultural output (primarily paddy) by
improving the quantity, reliability and timeliness of irrigation supplies to areas which were
already receiving supplementary irrigation from run-of-river supplies. The project essentially



2
consisted of changing from 'protective' to 'productive'" irrigation in two on-going run-of-river
projects, the Mahanadi Reservoir Project (MRP) and the Hasdeo Bango Project (HBP), together
with provision for the planning and design of another, as yet unirrigated area (Arpa), and
provision of a state-wide network of hydrological stations.
3.2   The original project financed a five-year slice of these two on-going irrigation
development schemes, and also provided for the preparation of the Arpa Scheme. The main
objectives of the project were to complete the planned storage reservoirs required to fully develop
the available water resources and to serve the target commands, and to extend and modernize the
conveyance system to meet peak water requirements and enhance efficiency of operation. The
project involved the construction of Hasdeo Bango and Sondur Dams; a new diversion barrage
at Rudri; improvements to three existing dams (Murumsilli, Dudhawa and Sikasar) and to
Hasdeo Barrage; the extension and modernization of irrigation over 69,000 ha in the Mahanadi
Reservoir Project and 85,000 ha in the Hasdeo Bango Project, including minor drainage works;
pilot construction of sub-chak channels and field drains; construction and improvement of
all-weather rural roads; detailed planning of the Arpa Scheme; farming systems research; a
state-wide network of hydrometeorological stations, technical assistance; and monitoring and
evaluation.
3.3   The project was restructured in 1990 to allow full utilization of credit savings by
increasing the size of some components and by increasing disbursement percentage under
Category I (Civil Works) of Schedule 1 of the Development Credit Agreement from 60% to
80%. The expansion of the Mahanadi Reservoir sub-project consisted of: (i) full completion of
the new Rudri Barrage; (ii) additional construction and/or lining of feeder and branch canals; and
(iii) increase in the unlined micro and rural irrigation networks by about 10% from 69,000 ha in
the original project target to about 76,000 ha. All these additional works are encompassed within
the original command of the Mahanadi Reservoir Project scheme and they are important to the
overall project objectives.
3.4   The expansion of the Hasdeo Bango sub-project consisted of: (i) enhancing the level of
completion of Hasdeo Bango Dam from 62% to 96%; (ii) completing the construction of 50 km
of the Left Bank Canal with an additional unlined channel length of 18 km; (iii) completing
construction of key branch canals; (iv) constructing associated distribution and micro networks,
which will bring into irrigation about 52,000 ha of additional agricultural land in the area that is
contiguous to the project command and part of the next time slice of the overall Hasdeo Bango
Project scheme; and (v) extending rural road networks by 58 km.
3.5   The total project costs were estimated at appraisal to be Rs.3,513.6 million, equivalent to
US$439.2 million. An IDA credit of SDR195.2 million (US$220 million equivalent) was to
finance about 50% of the project cost, including all the foreign exchange component, estimated at
US$63 million. Overall responsibility for project implementation was with the Chief Secretary in
the Government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP). Execution of the works was the responsibility of
the Chief Engineer for the Mahanadi Reservoir Project and the Chief Engineer for the Hasdeo
Bango Project under the coordination of the Engineer-in-Chief, Madhya Pradesh.
I     'Protective' irrigation is the provision of irrigation water to supplement rainfall
during drought periods during the kharif paddy season, and prevent disastrous failures.
'Productive' irrigation is the provision of irrigation water to ensure that crops receive the correct
amount of moisture to ensure high yields.

4. Project Design and Organization
4.1   The project was originally formulated in the 1970s by the technical departments of GOMP
and cleared by the Central Water Commission (CWC) of GOI. Bank involvement started in May
1979 when Water and Power Consultancy Services (WAPCOS) was hired by GOMP to prepare
a feasibility study to Bank standards. Appraisal was based upon this feasibility study which
addressed the main shortcomings of the original GOMP proposal (underestimation of crop water
requirements, overestimation of system efficiency, insufficient regulation and incomplete
provision for distributary systems). Sondur and Hasdeo Bango dams were under construction at
the time of appraisal to designs which had been reviewed by the Bank and which were to be
checked by the Dam Panel. Detailed project preparation had been completed for the feeder, and
main and branch canals to be built in the first year of implementation. For dams, provision was
made for a Dam Review Panel (national experts) to undertake periodic and comprehensive
reviews of the plans, designs and construction of dams and related structures. The project design
was conceptually simple and clear but technically complicated because the Mahanadi Reservoir
Project relied upon the eventual combined use of six storage reservoirs. The design and project
objectives were well understood by all directly concerned, though some parts of the micro
network design were the subject of differing views. The project contained one main innovative
feature - lined sub-minors and field channels in a predominantly rice growing area. It is most
unusual to line canals in rice growing areas where irrigation water is traditionally passed from
field to field, instead of using water courses to distribute to individual fields. The rationale for
this innovative feature was well explained in the SAR but is still the subject of debate.2 The scope
and scale of the project were appropriate to the circumstances. However, the inclusion of the
hydrological network on a state-wide basis, although perhaps desirable for future projects, would
have been more relevant for this project if restricted to the catchments contributing to the
Mahanadi Reservoir and Hasdeo Bango Schemes and the Arpa proposal.
4.2   The project, viewed overall, was reasonably well prepared. The project concept was
good and most components were clearly explained. The program for carrying out the
investigation, design, tender and implementation aspects of engineering works was too
optimistic and did not reflect the problems, already known at time of preparing the Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR), of slow tender and evaluation processes which affect not only civil
engineering contracts but also appointment of consultants to carry out the design work prior to
drafting contracts. In addition, the implementation arrangements in the SAR did not
acknowledge the short construction season (about five months per year for work for the irrigation
infrastructure).
4.3   The timing of the project was appropriate with regard to government policies at the time
(para 2.1). The SAR acknowledged the large staff increases necessary for the project -- 231
extra Irrigation Department engineers required in Year 1, increasing to 405 extra in Year 3 -- and
also acknowledged that a heavy burden would be placed on existing Irrigation Department staff.3
However, the SAR did not explain how 231 engineers were to be productively absorbed into the
project system in the first year, nor the effects that this might have on other state projects, nor the
2     "Tail-end" farmers interviewed supported the field channel design and stated that
the design had ensured timely supplies of water. Engineers doubted the sustainability of the
system at field level.

effect of other World Bank-funded projects in the same state upon availability of engineers.
4.4   The roles and responsibilities of the main agencies concerned were clearly defined and
understood. In general, these were validated under implementation conditions, although there
were problems with the roads caused mainly by the desire of the Irrigation Department to have
roads built by the Ayacut Department and not by Public Works Department.
4.5    The successes of the project are that so much was built and that, in most cases, major
structures have been designed and built without serious problems. In the area of small-scale
infrastructure, the lined canals within chak areas seem to have been most successful although the
issue of their utility is still a matter of debate (para 4. 1). These successes were assisted by the
SAR which specified technical assistance by national consulting firms. The areas of less success
were indicated by the delay and failure to establish a block-by-block development sequence. This
resulted in delays in obtaining benefits from the project. The aspects of project design and
organization leading to these failures were: the implementation schedule was too optimistic; a
lack of appreciation of the slow decision making process; an unrealistic assumption of the
availability of trained engineers; and a failure to appreciate the effect of natural disasters upon
local funds and resources and the need to allow for this in planning.
5. Project Implementation
5.1    Overall, the project has met most of its implementation targets. However, this could be
achieved only following four one-year extensions, thereby prolonging the total project period to
about nine years, compared to the originally planned period of about five years. Initial delays,
budget constraints and a declining value of the rupee against the US dollar/SDR, affected
disbursements and by June 1987, i.e. at the end of the originally planned implementation period,
disbursements stood at about 55% of the SAR estimate. The credit disbursements increased over
the next four years and by October 28, 1991 (the date of final disbursement), the disbursements
totalled US$195.4 million or 89% of the original credit amount of US$220 million (85% in terms
of SDR). As already noted (paras 3.3 and 3.4), the scope of the project was enlarged to cover an
area of 213,000 ha, with micro irrigation and distribution networks as against the original target
of 154,000 ha. Total project costs are now estimated at Rs.6,372.34 million (US$477.0
million), vis-a-vis an SAR estimate of Rs.3,513.6 million (US$439.2 million).
5.2   The most critical deviation between planned and actual project implementation was the
failure to develop the main canal system in tandem with the minor canalization. The connection
between main and minor canalization was planned in the SAR and was the way in which the
project could be expected to generate benefits at an early stage. In the SAR,4 benefits were
estimated to begin in Year 3. In fact, no benefits have occurred until Year 6, resulting in a lower
reestimated economic rate of return (ERR) than the appraisal estimate. The failure to synchronize
construction of main and minor canals simultaneously was caused by delays in the design for
major structures, delays in awarding contracts, under-performing and defaulting contractors, and
lack of continuity of senior engineers. Given the design and time scale of the project as outlined
in the SAR, it is difficult to envisage how these problems could have been avoided. They might,
however, have been reduced if GOMP had realized that the movement of senior staff would have
deleterious effects on project continuity and staff supervision and accountability, if staff and
working resources had been built up more rapidly, and if timely appointment of design
consultants was ensured.

5
5.3    Of the three main project risks identil'ied in the SAR,s one became a reality: GOMP
having difficulty in posting sufficient staff to the project. This did, in f'act, prove a great problem
in the early years and throughout the project there was dil1iculty in retaining scenior enlginieers in
their posts. The SAR expectation was that the use of consulltants would reduce the risk, and to
some extent this was the case. However, the consultanits themselves had stafl'filng problems
during the early years of the project. Natural and man-made disasters at state an(d sub-state level
affected progress of the project due to curtailmenit of local fuind allocationis to the pro.ject. These
included droughts in 1981, 1986, 1987 and 1988 and the leak ol toxic gas trom Union Carbide
Works in Bhopal in 1984. Furthermore, tlhere was an unrieasonlable delay in awardinig contracts
for consultancies and contractors.
5.4    During implementation, the Sondur Dam and Hasdeo Bango Dam reservoil areas came
under submergence. The actual number of families to be resettled was 302 for the Sondur Dam
and 2,716 for the Hasdeo Bango Dam, much morc tlhan the appraisal estimaltes of 190 and 1,400
families respectively. This variance was mainly due to a large number of "encroacher" f'amilies
that were not officially listed in the revenue land iecords. Initially, GOMP was slow to react to
Bank's requirement to formulate and implemeint a proper resettlemenit plan. However, at
completion, the situation was a good dceal belter tlhan miglht have beeni expected.
5.5    As a result of experience gainied at the Sondul Dam, and the growing realization that the
Bank was not going to overlook the problems, GOMP's resettlemenit and relhabilitation progr-am
at the Hasdeo Bango Dam was better organized. The issue of' cash compensation disparity arose,
but this was rectified by making extra ex-gratia payments to the al'fected families, especially those
moved during the earlier stages of the program's implementation. The PCR mission visited two
resettlement sites. Both were incomplete with regard to services, hut a major parlt of the work
had been done. Not many people were seeni, but those met and interviewed seemed to be
reasonably content.
6. Project Results
6. 1   The project has been, by and large, successflul in aclievinig most of its physical targets
albeit with significant delays. The first beniel'its from the Malhanadi Reservoir Pro ject were in
1986/87 and from  the Hasdeo Bango Project in 1990/91. It is expected that output of
agricultural produce will increase year by year as the remaininlg bottlenecks in water supply are
removed, and farmers transfer to higher yielding crops and cropping practices. There are
reassuring indications that GOMP will press foorward with the remaining works necessary to
complete the entire schemes. Thus, the project should achieve its main objective of increasing
agricultural output.
6.2    Appraisal economic results were based upon the assumptionl that thle project-funded
works would be completed in five years. In actual fact, the time takeni to carry out most of the
works is ten years, with benefits lagging more tlhan predicted. As a result, tlle economic results
estimated at appraisal have had to be lowered, par-ticuLlar-ly as the completioni date for the whole
project is now expected to be the Year 2005 instead of 1996. The ERR for the project is
5      Staff Appraisal Report, Para. 6.07. Risks were (1) slow construction of sub-
minors; (2) irrigation of summer paddy might be peimitted; (3) stafl'f recruitment difficulties.



6
reestimated at 15%, as against the appraisal estimate ol' 21%.6 This variation is smaller than
might have been expected due to yield levels being slightly higher than estimated at appraisal.
However, it should be noted that at present only about 10% of the irrigable command area has
been actually developed. The re-estimated ERR is based on benefit build-up resulting from only a
projected phased expansion of the developed area (Annex 1, Tables 4 and 5) and should,
therefore, be considered indicative. At full development, the annual production7 is estimated to
increase by 1,254,000 tons of paddy (SAR 975,000 tons), 237,000 tons of other grains (SAR
184,000 tons), 1,071,000 tons of sugarcanie (SAR  1,(071,()000 tons) and about 41,000 of
groundnut. Net far-m incomes are estimated to increase by about 160%(I dLC to the project.
6.3    The implementation of the project has made a number of positive contributions in
secondary benefits and hence the development of the project area and to the resources of the
province. These are: secure and increased supplies of water to industry and for urban use;
human resource development, in particular training and practical experience in the development of
inigated agriculture; improvement in the physical environment, including provision of reservoirs
as a social, nutritional and recreational resource; and multiplier effect of the project resulting in an
undoubted increase in goods and services available in local towns, witlh a conresponding increase
in local economic well being.
7. Proiect Sustainability
7.1    Given efficient continuing operation and maintenance, the benefits generated by the
irrigation components are likely to increase and then be maintained durinig the economic life of the
project. Most of the main structures (dams, batrages, regulators, etc.) are likely to last more than
100 years, if adequately maintained. The shorter life items, unless well maintained, are the minor
canalization earthwork (particularly sub-chak channels) (1(0-15 years) and all canal lining works
(20-40 years). Unless sufficient money is expended upon maintenance, canal lining will break up
and become fragmented - which has in fact happened to distlibutaries lined about 30 years ago,
only vestiges of which are now visible. The sub-chak and unlined chak channels are at risk fiom
lack of maintenance because these channels have been built with flarmers' agreement but without
purchasing the land from them. There is a danger that illegal outlets at the head of these channels
will be built and the channels then fall into disuse and gradually disappear.
7.2   The risks of project performance deteriorating with time can be reduced by: ensuring that
the beneficiaries pay the full cost of operation and maintenance (O&M); adequate funding of
O&M;8 adequate staffing and training of project operation staff; enhanced awareness campaigns
to emphasize the usefulness of sub-chak channels; and ftormation of effective farmers' users
association to take over responsibility for O&M. In essence, the sustainability of the project will
6     The costs of and benefits arising from municipal and industlial water supply
component were excluded in the SAR analysis but have been included in the PCR analysis (see
para. 1 1 of Annex 1).
7     Based on yield estimates presenited in Annex 1, Table SA.
8     At present, an average of Rs.80/ha/year is expended on O&M. Pro'ject engineers
at the Mahanadi Reservoir and Hasdeo Bango Projects consider effective O&M for sustainable
operation requires Rs.150/ha/year. However, O&M funding allocation should be based on actual
requirements.

be greatly in jeopardy unless sufficient funds are made available foir operation and maintenance.
Fund allocation for O&M should be based on actual requirements and not on some outdated
standard parameter. In addition, it is also important that the unlined sub-chak field canals built
under the project-supported pilot program covering 15,5(X) ha are well maintained so as to permit
a proper evaluation of their peifoimance. If perfoimance of the pilot project is found beneficial,
their adoption should be encouraged in other areas of the command.
8. Bank's Performance
8.1    Appraisal was on the whole well done, with a conceptually excellelnt project, slightly
marred by excessive optimism about speed of delivery of designs, contract award, resources and
hence achieving the required construction targets. The Bank's performance throughout the project
cycle was competent and professional. Bank staff obtained a well thought out project from
GOMP preparation and improved it at appraisal. Supervision was timely, thoughtful and tactful
yet generally effective. Less emphasis on purely engineering supervision in early missions and
the addition of an institutions specialist might have helped to mitigate later problems with contract
adjudication and award. However, the Bank was responsive to mission staffing and soon
provided a more mixed team for supervision.
8.2   The main lessons of expeilence that may be relevant to the Bank are:
consulting contracts should be in a linal state lor signlature pi-ior to credit
effectiveness;
all significant designs for construction during the first two years of the project
period should be complete by appraisal;
assurances of counterpart funding and resourcc availability should be closely
examined to avoid eventual problems wlhich cause implementation delays;
full consideration should be giveni to the ability of the project organization to
integrate all aspects of irrigationi development and its requirement to work under
public sector regulations wlhen f'ixing constructioni targets, so that undue optimism
is avoided; and
realistic budgetary allocations for O&M, even al'fte closure of the project period,
are essential if an illrigation pr'oject is to be sustainable.
9. Borrower's Performance
9.1   The BolTower made a genuine effort to meet the SAR targets in terms of finance and other
resources, and tried hard to accelerate the development of tihe sclheme. Progress was not as rapid
as projected in the SAR because of the implementation problems of budget allocation, staffing
and letting of contracts (para 4.5). As a result of the lack of progress on tlhese problems, almost
all aspects of the project were delayed beyond their target dates. Botlh the Mahaniadi Reservoir
and the Hasdeo Bango projects sufl'ered firom chaniges ol' Chief Enginieers at critical periods.
Frequent changing of senior staff resulled in lack of coordiniation, resettlemelnt delays, and
reduced accountability.
9.2    During the preparation process, the Borrower was lhelpl'ul and enhllusiastic, and
cooperated fully with the Bank. However, the planned rate of development (154,000 ha in a



8
30-month effective working period) was too optimistic, and provided a good example of the
common dichotomy between what is seen as possible when arranging project tinancing and what
is actually possible from a construction view-point. Througlhout implementation, GOMP
endeavoured to build the schemes according to the principles of the SAR. Bank supervision
missions' suggestions were, when possible, acted upon, although ofteni with considerable delay.
The standard of construction was, in general, acceptable9 though some problems were caused by
using quite small contractors for relatively large works. Overall, the most serious effect of
GOMP's performance during implementation was the failure to obtain phased canalization/block
development, and with this a consequenlt delay in obtaining benel'its.
9.3   In the Mahanadi Reservoir Project sclheme, delays in completion of Rudri barrage and
cross regulating structuLes interf'ered with the phased developmenit plan, as did the delay in
construction of five in-line syphons on the riglht bank main canal in the Hasdeo Bango Project.
These were essential to enable increased water flows to the iriiigationl area, and three were still
incomplete in December 1991. Project management was seriously al'fected by fiequent changes
of senior personnel. This seems to have happened due to the pressuLe resultinig t'rom the need in
India to not only supervise new construction bhut also service the increasinig demand for
operation, maintenance and relhabilitation of projects executed durinig the large expansion of
irrigation which has taken place. Absence ol' contilluity in and the consequellt lack ol firm project
management, was probably one of the major causes of excessive delays in awardinig contracts,
and of the lack of planning and drive to obtain ear-ly beiiel'its by proceedinig onl a block-by-block
basis.
9.4    Lessons of experience tor both GOI anid GOM4P are:
projects should have realistic conlstrullctioIn pIrogr-amils;
every effort should be made to ensure continuity of' senior stal'f to maintain a
cohesive 'project team';
major design work should be complete belore the credit becomes efl'ective and
an angemenlts for consultinig work should he at a liinal stage ol' completioni; and
procedures t'oi teniderinlg, adjudication and letting ol' conltracts shoulld be
reviewed.
10. Project Relationship
10.1  The relationship between the Bank and GOI/GOMP was cordial and mutually respectfiul.
Supervision provided a number of criticisms ot tihe Borrower's perlfor-manice, some of which
might have developed strained relationis, but the use ol- reasonied discussion and the mature
attitude of the Borrower obtained reasonable results without rallcourl.
9     Some reservationis about the conlstlrLctioll ol' the Hasdeo Bango Dam have been
expressed in a separate note "Hasdeo Bango Darn, Note on Seepage Rates andl Action Required",
Investment Center, FAO, Rome, Januar y 1992.

11. Consulting Services
11.1  Consultants played a substantial role in project procedures. They were used to assist
planning, programming and preparation of the next time slice, and for the survey and design of
the irrigation and drainage system below distributary canal head regulators. The consulting
services, although useful in the long-term, took a long time to arrange and then commenced work
slowly because of staff shortages. In India, if there is a shortage of engineers in the public
service, there may also be a shortage of engineers in the quasi-government consulting services,
such as were employed on this project. This suggests the need that the consultants should be
made to provide a performance bond to guarantee adequacy of staffing.
11.2  The Dam Review Panel operated successfully and ensured a reasonable degree of safety
for the existing dams by means of up-to-date hydrological analysis. This resulted in heightening,
strengthening and better spillway arTangements. The design of Hasdeo-Bango Dam was slightly
changed to provide concrete cover on its upstream face. A recent review has raised the problem
of possible seepage at this dam.'0 GOMP has been informed of the problem and they refeiTed the
matter to the Dam Safety Panel established under the project. If actions at-e required, the problem
will be tackled under the ongoing Dam Safety Project (Cr. 2241-IN/Ln.3325-(IN).
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.1  The SAR provided a satisfactoiy fi-amework for the Bank and the Borrower and the
provisions of the legal agreements wet-e generally observed (Part 111/7).

Comments:
Delayed implementation and slow disbursements at the beginning of the project
resulted in a four year-extension of the credit closing date to June 1991,
to enable extended scope of project works to be completed and to draw down as
far as possible funds available in the credit. The final disbursement was made
on October 28, 1991.

Date of Finat Disbursement:    October 28, 1]991
I July to 30 June.
3/ Though project 5-year time stice started from 1 July 1981, it became effective from 16 April 1982.
Source:  Uorld Bank, New Delhi. Monthly Disbursement Performance Reports.
4/ As of September 1990, the disbursement rate for civil works has been increased from 60 to 80X.
6/ As at 28 October 1991 (SOR 165.5 million).
6/ Percentages based on credit total in SOR (SDR195.2 million).
Comments:
The disbursement schedule was revised in an attempt to use all the credit, about 85% of which has now been disbursed. The undisbursed balance as
at 280ctober 1991 amounts to US$40.3 million. Although the original amount of the credit was US$220 million equivalent, because of exchange rate
movements of the SDR vis-A-vis the US Dollar, the revised estimate of the credit is now US$235.6 million.

FOOTNOTES
IX   Includes 33% of works completed prior to IDA time slice.
2/   Includes 10 km completed to 6/81.
3/   Revised time slice target including proposed additional work up to June 1991.
4/   Improvements to following dams: Murumsilli, Dudhawa, Sikasar.
6/   On average, 50% of the works in progress can be considered as completed.
6/   Additional Branch canal proposed.
7/   Includes Abhanpur Lift Canal System.
S/   Updated figures after Survey.
9/   Out of a total target of 76,000 ha, the survey has been done for 54,000 ha and it is
established that out of 54,000 ha, only 11,500 ha require drainage.
IO/ Original SAR programme (priority-I, 262.5 km programme virtually completed).
II/  For the three structures under progress, nearly 50% of the works can be considered
completed, which results in a completion rate of 70%.
12/   Work of all structures is in progress, which would constitute 30% of completion.
13/   Lining for Right Bypass canal not yet started.
14/   Additional Branch Canal proposed.
151   Out of 85,000 ha, actual area requiring drainage is 45,000 ha.
16/   Refers to dam construction only.
17/  126 ha of private land acquired during 1977/78 (prior to time slice) are included in
3,031 ha.
18/   A further 259 families shall be resettled by June 1992, before filling the reservoir to full
level. Award of all 57 villages out of 58 passed for payment for a total of Rs88.8
million, out of which Rs87.7 million have been paid.
Comments:
The SAR did not give quantities for lining for each main and branch canal and did not quote
the number of structures to be built. The revised implementation schedule included
additional works to be carried out under the project. In MRP, construction works of Rudri
Barrage was increased by 3%, lining of feeder and branch canals increased by 27 km, one
additional branch canal (Baloda Bazar Branch Canal) included, and the canal distribution
system in the 40 ha blocks was extended by 7,300 ha. In HBP, dam construction was
increased by 34%, the length of unlined branch canals increased by a total of 87 km and
additional lining of 7 km was proposed (Akaltara Branch canal). Further, the canal
distribution system down to 40 ha blocks and in the 40 ha blocks was increased by 52,000 ha
and 30,000 ha respectively.

Revised project costs were first based on expenditure reported up to 31 March 1985. These were tentative and have been revised during project progress. During the
last supervision mission in 1990, additional works, to be financed out of credit savings, have been included in the project and the disbursement rate for civil works was
increased from 60% to 80% (effective I September 1990).

Comments
The undisbursed balance as at 28 October 1991 amounts to USt40.3 million. Although the
original amount of the credit was USS220 million equivalent (SDR = 195.2 million), because
of exchange rate movements of the SDR vis-&-vis the USS, the final estimate of the credit is
now USt235.6 million.

Comments
The increase in net farm incomes for MRP and HB schemes would range from 102% to 320%
and average about 160%. This decrease is caused by the PCR mission assuming a higher pre-
project yield for irrigated paddy (2 tons/ha as against 1.6 tons/ha). In addition to these direct
benefits, the project would generate indirect benefits through a series of multiplier employment
and income effects that would not be confined to the project area.

(CREDIT 1177-IN)
ANNEX I. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
1.        An accurate re-evaluation of the economic impact of the project can be made
only after the project is completed and its results have been monitored. Since in this
case this was not possible, the economic impact has been measured by the mission purely
on the basis of the economic rate of return (ERR) for which sufficient cost data were
available; however, the data to measure the related economic benefits could only be
derived from the partially developed command areas. The ERR was applied over the
overall investment for the scheme construction programme and not over the time-slice
only. To ensure a relatively sound comparison, the ERR estimate has been, as much as
possible, aligned with the one used in the SAR.
Assumptions
2.        Economic rates of return (ERRs) have been calculated using December 1991
constant prices over a period of 50 years. Economic prices of traded commodities, such
as rice, wheat, maize, groundnuts, sugarcane and agricultural inputs have been derived
from the World Bank-projected world market prices, expressed in 1991 currency
value,11 with appropriate adjustments for freight, handling and processing (Table 2 of
this annex). Import parity prices have been used for agricultural inputs. For foodgrains,
average of import and export parity prices have been used, as India is becoming self-
sufficient in foodgrains. Trade statistics indicate that India imports or exports foodgrains,
depending on the size of the annual harvests.
3.        For non-traded commodities, a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.8 2/
has been used to convert financial prices into economic prices. Prices are presented in
Table 1.
Economic Costs
4.        All costs of the project have been included in the analysis, adjusted by the
relevant conversion factors.3 Costs incurred before 1991 have been adjusted using GDP
deflators (see Table 3) to reflect costs in 1991.

INDIA. Madhya Pmdesh Major lription Projct
Annex 1: Economic and Financial Analysis
5.         Construction costs, equipment and material costs have been adjusted by the
construction conversion factor of 0.80. As the foreign exchange component is negligible,
an SCF of 0.8 has been applied to all other project costs. Operation and maintenance
costs have been included for the incremental irrigable area at a rate of Rs8O/ha up to
1990/91, and at Rsl5O/ha as from 1991/92, to take into account the increased
maintenance need of project works. Since operation and maintenance involves mostly
employment of unskilled or semi-skilled labour, the unskilled labour conversion factor
of 0.67 was applied. Costs of land acquisition have been assumed to be equal to their
opportunity cost, i.e. the value of production foregone without the project. Resettlement
costs have been valued at their financial cost multiplied by the construction conversion
factor. A shadow price for agricultural labour has been applied at 67% of its financial
cost. The economic value of draft animal work of Rs35/day (one pair of bullocks with
an operator) was derived from the current market rate of Rs5O/day.
Incremental Benefits
6.         The economic benefits have been estimated on the basis of incremental
production of crops (net of on-farm production costs), generated from increased
irrigation intensity and changes in cropping patterns. Benefit build-up is a result of the
assumed phasing of areas to come under irrigation each year (see Tables 4 and 5).
Average annual irrigated areas in terms of 'without' and 'With project' situation can be
summarized as follows:

Crop Budgets
7.         The assumptions on yields, farm input requirements and cropping patterns
for the 'with' as well as 'without' project situation were based on direct information from
the field. Project yields represent an estimate of the average yield which can be expected
under assured water supply in an average year, assuming satisfactory supporting services.
It has been assumed that production on rainfed areas which have remained rainfed until
full development, or after creation of the irrigation potential, has not increased due to
the project. Thus, the comparison is limited to newly irrigated areas and what these
same areas produced under previous rainfed conditions. No changes in yields and
cropping pattern are assumed for the 'future without' situation. The areas under the

4/ From 'protectii' irription to ptroductive irription.
Cropping Intensity
8.              At full development, total cropping intensity would reach 175% in MRP and
170%Y in HBP.
9.              In the MRP area, the build-up rates for the kharif and rabi crops in the
'future without project' condition would be similar to those made for the 'with project'
situation (kharif - paddy irrigated : 100%; irrigated rabi crops: 35%). With the
operation of Pairi High Dam, sufficient storage water would be made available, on a



34
INDLA Madhya Prah Major Imiption Projc
Annex 1: Economic and Fianal Analysis
regular basis, to irrigated rabi crops. In the HBP, with the completion of Hasdeo Bango
Dam by June 1992, sufficient storage water would become available for rabi and the
introduction of summer and perennial crops (kharif - paddy irrigated: 92%; irrigated rabi
crops: 50%; summer crops: 20%; perennials: 8%).  Full irrigation development is
expected to occur in Year 2003 in the HBP and in Year 2006 in the MRP.
Incremental Production
10.        The aggregate of incremental production is based on crop budgets on a
hectare basis. At full development, incremental agricultural production 1/ for both
projects would be of the order of 1,254,000 tons of paddy, 237,000 tons of wheat and
maize, 83,000 tons of gram/pulses, 267,000 tons of horticultural produce, 1,071,000 tons
of sugarcane and 41,000 tons of groundnuts. Agricultural development at full production
is shown in para 19 of this annex.
Other Benefits
11.       In addition to increased agricultural production, the project would provide
for industrial water supplies for the thermal power stations and other industrial users at
Korba, for a steel plant at Bhilai and for municipal water requirements of Raipur and
Bhilai towns. At full development, total water supply 21 from the MRP was estimated at
440 Mm3 p.a., and from the HBP at 540 Mm3 p.a.. Water for industrial use would be
supplied at a financial cost of Rs282,500/Mm3 (Rs8,000/Mft3) and for domestic use at
Rs42,300/Mm3 (Rsl,200/Mft3). These benefits have been included in the economic
analysis, applying an SCF of 0.8.3/
12.        From 1992 onwards, fish production would be introduced in both projects.
However, these benefits, though estimated, have been excluded from project analysis.
1/ Based on yield estimates presented in Table 5A.
2/ Industrial and domestic.
3/ The SAR in its analysis had excluded both the costs of and benefits arising from the municipal and
industrial water supply (M&I) component. The SAR had allocated about 85% of all investment costs
of water resources development to the irrigation component. In the PCR analysis, the costs of and
benefits arising from M&I component have been included. The estimate of benefits arising from M&I
component is based on actual revenues received by HBP and MRP.

Annex 1: Economic and Financial Analysis
Economic Rate of Return
13.       Based on the above assumptions, ERRs have been estimated for the two sub-
projects (Tables 6 and 7) and for the whole project. Discounting costs and benefits over
a 50-year period, the estimated ERRs for the two projects at full development are as
follows:
ERR (%)
MRP                      14.9
HBP                      15.4
Whole project            15.2
These results reflect the phasing of the benefits which depend: (i) on the assumed build-
up of command areas developed, and (ii) on the expected adoption of the new improved
technical packages.
14.       The above ERRs are less than those calculated at appraisal (20% for MRP,
22% for HBP and 21% for the overall project). This reduction in the ERR is mainly due
to increased project costs and the delay in project implementation, resulting in deferred
accrual of benefits. These foregoing results, which can still be considered satisfactory,
are partly due to: (i) higher yield estimates for irrigated paddy than at appraisal; (ii)
increased prices of the project's major produce, rice; and (iii) the assumptions made for
high value crops requiring less water in the HB project and rabi irrigation in the MRP
project. However, it should be borne in mind, that the project is in principle not even
half way completed as far as the agricultural development is concerned: only 10% of the
irrigable command area has been fully developed. The development projection includes
therefore still a large element of uncertain estimates.
Sensitivity Analysis
15.       To measure the impact of possible changes in the economic environrent on
the project's stream of benefits and costs, several sensitivity tests were performed. One
test was to estimate the change in ERR for the overall project, against a range of
changes in the key assumption. The result of this test is as follows:

Benefits down by 50%                      6.8%
Benefits lag by 3 years                   11.4%
16.         One of the major uncertainties in the maintenance of the irrigation system
from now until the end of project life, would be the use of water for rabi irrigation.
Assuming that there would be no rabi irrigation in MRP and a 50% reduction in
irrigated rabi benefits in the HBP, the ERRs would be reduced to 11.7% in MRP and
13% in HBP.
B. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
17.         To assess the impact of the project on the farmers, four models of partial
farm budget based on two hectares have been prepared:

18.            Due to the project, the net farm  income in the presently irrigated area of the
MRP would increase about 102% from Rs6,658 to Rs13,416, and of the HBP about
120% from Rs7,290 to Rsl6,000. This result is slightly lower than was expected in the
SAR, which is caused by the PCR mission assuming a higher pre-project yield for
irrigated paddy (2 tons/ha as against 1.6 tons/ha 'present without project' and 1.8
tons/ha 'future without project'). In the new irrigated areas, net farm income would
range from 190% in the MRP to 320% in the HBP. The overall net farm increase would
be of the order of 160%.
19.            The expected annual increase in agricultural production at full development
would be as follows:
