INDIA
MADHYA PRADESH MAJOR IRRIGATION PROJECT
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.01      The State of Madhya Pradesh (MP), located in central India, is the
largest State in the country. Because of the large inter-annual and intra-
seasonal rainfall fluctuation, and the small percentage area under irrigation
in the State, agricultural production varies widely. At present, only 14% of
MP's water resources are developed. The Government of MP (GOMP) gives high
priority to irrigation development and has allocated about 30% of the Sixth
State Plan expenditure to this sector.
1.02      The Government of India (GOI) has requested IDA assistance for a
five-year (1981/82-1985/86) time slice development of three major irrigation
schemes in the Mahanadi river basin (Map IBRD 15146R). These schemes are
located in the predominantly rice growing Chattisgarh region of eastern MP
and will serve about 702,000 ha at full development (in 15-20 years). The
IDA-assisted project would modernize and extend irrigation facilities over
about 629,000 ha in the two major schemes 1/, Mahanadi Reservoir Project (MRP)
and Hasdeo-Bango (HB) which are already partly developed. It would also
assist with the planning and design of the Arpa Scheme (about 73,000 ha).
Agriculture and Irrigation in India
1.03      India has a population of about 680 M which is growing at an annual
rate of about 1.9%. Since 1960, per capita income grew at an annual rate of
1.4% and reached US$190 in 1979/80. Although the average per capita income
has increased and access to public services has improved, in general, there
has been little change in the incomes of the vast masses of urban and rural
poor, who comprise about 50% of the total population. Accordingly, GOI's
development plans give priority to alleviating poverty and creating employ-
ment, especially in rural areas.
1.04      Agriculture is the dominant sector of the Indian economy and con-
tributes about 40% of GNP. It engages about 70% of the labor force and pro-
vides the base for about 55% of India's exports. During the last decade, GOI
has devoted considerable attention to agriculture in its development plans.
To support agricultural growth, GOI has: (i) accelerated irrigation develop-
ment through modernization of existing schemes and constructions of new
schemes; and (ii) improved agricultural supporting services to optimize the
use of land and water resources.
1/   This includes about 34,000 ha under the MRP scheme which will also be
developed (starting about 1991) in Pairi Command, and which constitutes
a self-contained irrigation area.



-2-
1.05      Irrigation was given the highest priority from the beginning of the
planning era in 1950. Some 52.6 M ha were developed by 1979/80, about 58% of
which is from surface sources and 42% from groundwater. Irrigated areas are
almost four times as productive as rainfed areas and they account for about
60% of all agricultural output in India. More significantly the expansion
of irrigation facilities and the productivity growth on irrigated lands have
together accounted for at least three-quarters of agricultural growth since
1960.
1.06      The area developed for irrigation is expected to grow to 66.2 M ha
by the end of 1985/86, of which 56% will be from surface sources and 44% from
groundwater sources. 1/ With little idle land left for cultivation, limited
increase is expected in the net sown area in the future and the main increase
in agricultural production will need to come from double cropping and from
improvements in water management and in the use of agricultural inputs. In
most completed projects the actual irrigated areas are less than planned and
yields have been much lower than the original forecast. GOI and the State
Governments are aware of the challenge and are seeking solutions to the dual
problem of low irrigation intensities and poor yields. Solutions involve
improved efficiency of the physical system, more flexible and imaginative water
management practices and improvements in the supply of agricultural inputs
(credit, extension, etc.).
1.07      The projects of the early 1960s typically involved a storage or
diversion dam and main conveyance system only, leaving distribution of water
from the project outlets to the efforts of the farmers. As some of these
outlets served areas in excess of 100 ha, conveyance of water to the farmgate
necessitated the construction of minor channel networks that were sometimes
several kilometers long. In most projects, farmers were unable to finance or
organize construction of the minor channels without outside assistance, which
was only rarely available. The long delays between water availability in the
main conveyance system and its use by farmers made these irrigation projects
a marginal investment.
1.08      In the early 1970s, the concept of the Command Area Development
Authority (CADA) evolved. Its objective was to coordinate the activities of
the Irrigation and Agriculture Departments and to assist farmers in obtaining
institutional credit for the construction of the minor systems and levelling
and bunding of their fields. Undoubtedly, there have been benefits from this
effort; but the results have been less than expected. Further analysis of
the reasons for the gap between the irrigation potential created and actual
utilization as well as lower irrigated cropping intensities and yields than
forecast indicates that: (i) more emphasis is needed on improving the effi-
ciency and reliability of the conveyance system from the water source to the
irrigation outlets; and (ii) Government should assume responsibility for
conveying water much closer to farmgate. Only when the farmer is fully
confident of his water supply will he undertake investments in modern inputs
to make full use of water supplied. These concepts were used in the design
of irrigation networks and improved agricultural procedures have been adopted
for the proposed project.

The State of Madhya Pradesh 1/
1.09      Salient Features.  The State of Madhya Pradesh covers an area of
about 44.3 M ha which constitute 13.5% of the total area of India. Its popu-
lation of about 52 M (1980) is predominantly rural (84%) and is growing at
about 2.6% per annum. Population density of 94 persons per km is about 60%
of the national average. With about 20% of the population being tribal, the
State of MP has the largest concentration of tribal people in India. The
labor participation rate is about 37% of the total population with cultivators
and agricultural laborers accounting for 80% of the labor force. The average
farm size is about 3.6 ha. Small and marginal farmers (owning less than 2 ha)
operate over 50% of the holdings but control less than 10% of the cultivable
land.
1.10      Education and health standards are low.  Literacy rate is only
22% compared to the all-India rate of 29%, and the ratios of medical doctors
and health centers to population are well below the national average. Only
17% of the villages are electrified. Road and railway networks are inadequate
for supporting the development of available natural resources (minerals, fuel,
timber, iron ore, etc.) and for transporting the inputs and outputs of a more
modern agriculture.
1.11      The Economy.  Agriculture is the dominant sector in the State's
economy and accounts for 57% of the State Net Domestic Product (NDP). Between
1970/71 and 1977/78, there was virtually no growth in the agricultural sector
compared to 3.4% for India. During the same period, the industrial sector
grew at 6.2% per annum compared with 11% for India but it accounts for less
than 20% of NDP and its effect on the overall growth rate was small. Growth
in the other sectors, accounting for 23% of NDP, was insignificant. Because
of the poor performance of all sectors, except for the industrial sector, the
State NDP from 1970/71 to 1977/78 grew at an annual rate of 1.8% which during
the same period, is only 25% of the growth rate for India (7.2%). In this
time, per capita income in the State declined by 0.9% per annum, compared to
a 1.1% growth in the national average. In 1977/78, the per capita income was
estimated at Rs 896, about three-quarter of the national average.
1.12      Agricultural Performance.  The net sown area in 1977/78 amounted
to 18.8 M ha (84% of cultivable area in the State), mostly single-cropped
during the monsoon (kharif) season or planted to crops in the dry (rabi)
season on stored soil moisture following a monsoon fallow. At present, only
11% of the total cropped area is irrigated. Between 1970/71 and 1978/79, the
production of foodgrains increased at the rate of 0.5% p.a. mostly due to
small increases in areas sown. Production levels for other crops in MP
have remained almost constant. Due to variability in rainfall, yield levels
of all crops have fluctuated widely year by year, but with no significant
trend upward for any major crop with the exception of wheat, where yields
have increased at a rate of about 2.9% p.a. since about 1970/71.
1.13      Yields of most major food ctops in MP are significantly below
India's already low average. The discrepancy is most marked in the two major

foodgrains, rice and wheat for which the Indian average is roughly 50% higher
than the MP yields. This reflects the relatively high proportion of rainfed
agriculture and unimproved varieties of wheat and rice and low consumption of
fertilizers, at one-fourth of the national average. Yields of coarse grains
(jowar, maize, bajra and barley) are more in line with all-India averages, but
oilseed yields are very low, at 60% of the India average.
1.14      Fertilizer use in MP, although it has recently accelerated, averaged
about 7.4 kg nutrient per ha in 1977/78 (of which 70% of the annual consumption
is distributed in the rabi season) which can be compared with the All-India
consumption rate of 17.1 kg/ha in 1975/76. In the project area, the 1977/78
consumption rates were 10.2 kg/ha and 7.3 kg/ha in Raipur and Bilaspur Dis-
tricts respectively.
1.15      IrrigatiRn Development.  MP has vast water resourses, estimated
at 243.8 billion m'.  At present, only about 34.3 billion m or 14% of the
surface water and the groundwater is utilized.  Despite the availability of
rich water resources and the fact that within MP are the catchments of all
eleven of the major rivers l/ of central India, only 11% of the net cropped
area (about 2.2 M ha) in the State is irrigated, compared to the national
average of about 26%. Of the 2.2 M ha of net irrigated area, about half is
from canals (Government schemes) and half from wells (largely private):

Canals                         0.97                      45.0
Wells                           0.86                     40.0

Total                          2.15                     100.0
About one third of the canal irrigation is under major schemes (over 10,000
ha), about one third under medium schemes (2,000-10,000 ha), and about one
third under minor schemes (below 2,000 ha). Irrigation is almost exclusively
limited to one season (kharif); less than 5% of the irrigated area receives
water supplies in both seasons.
1.16      The State accords a high priority to irrigation as a means of
raising both agricultural production and the incomes of the rural poor. The
share of irrigation in total plan expenditures rose from 20% during the Second
Five-Year Plan (1956/57-1960/61) to 30% in the Sixth Five Year Plan (1979/80-
1984/85). Between 1956/57 to 1978/79, the increase in irrigation potential
created was about 6% p.a. (Table T-1). However, actual utilization has fallen
well below the potential created, ranging between 59% to 77%. The main rea-
sons for this poor performance are:
1/   The Mahanadi, Mahi, Narmada, Tapi, Chambal and Betwa, major tributaries
of the Yamuna; the Son, a major tributary of the Ganga; and the Wainganga,
Indravati, Sabati and Pench, major tributaries of the Godavari (see Map
IBRD 15146).

(a)  Inadequate conveyance system.  In many cases, dams have been
built and water stored, but distribution systems were left
incomplete with outlet command areas (chaks) ranging from
40 ha to over 100 ha. Because of this lag in the construc-
tion of the minor distribution systems, the water was pre-
empted at the head of the system after water had become
available in the larger canals. This, combined with the
ability of influential groups to monopolize water, has
resulted in large areas--especially at the tailend of the
commands--being left unirrigated.
(b)  Over optimistic design assumptions on crop water require-
ments and conveyance and irrigation losses, which have not
been monitored under actual field conditions. This has led
to a significant overestimation of the area that can be
irrigated with the water available leaving a substantial
gap between the areas for which canals were built and the
areas which actually received water on a regular basis.
Previous Bank Group Operations in Madhya Pradesh
1.17      The Bank Group has contributed to the development of MP's agricul-
tural sector through five previous IDA credits. However, its involvement in
irrigation has been small compared with the Bank Group contribution to irri-
gation in some other States in India until the recently approved MP Medium
Irrigation Project (US$140.0 M credit of March 26, 1981, Cr. 1108-IN). The
HP Agricultural Credit Project (US$33.0 M credit of June 8, 1973, Cr. 391-IN)
was designed to expand and improve the credit facilities available to farmers
throughout the State. The MP Dairy Project (US$16.4 M credit of December 18,
1974, Cr. 522-IN) is supporting dairy development organized along the lines
of the successful Amul dairy cooperative set up in neighboring Gujarat State.
Farmer response has been excellent and the Government is under considerable
producer pressure to speed up the establishment of dairy cooperatives through-
out the State. The Chambal (MP) Command Area Development Project (US$24.0 M
credit of June 20, 1975, Cr. 652-IN) was designed to improve the efficiency of
water utilization in the command area of the Chambal Project in MP and bring
additional areas under irrigation. This project started slowly, but is now
about to be completed. The major constraint was the slow acceptance by the
farmer of on-farm development which was meant to be carried out (and paid for)
by the farmers themselves with agricultural credit sources available to them
from the proceeds of the Credit. 1/ The MP Forestry Technical Assistance
1/   The'reduction of the outlet command size from some 40 ha to about 8 ha
in MP, as is now the policy elsewhere in India also, has meanwhile
eliminated part of the problem with the construction of the minor canal
system which conveys water to the farmgates. Originally this was to be
a major part of the on-farm works, but as this part of the canal system
was not on the property of individual farmers, they were reluctant to
finance the works from credit. The system is now constructed by the
Government from budget funds.

Project (US$4.0 M credit of February 26, 1976, Cr. 609-IN) provided the funds
for a feasibility study, completed in November 1979, for the establishment of
a saw-wood mill and a pulp factory based on the forest resources of southeas-
tern MP. The MP Agricultural Extension and Research Project (US$10.0 M credit
of June 1, 1977, Cr. 712-IN) was designed to strengthen agricultural support-
ing services, particularly extension and research. Staff shortages, espe-
cially in supervisory and managerial posts, have delayed implementation of the
extension component, but results in areas where regular extension visits are
being made attest to the potential effectiveness of the extension system under
the project. Phase II of MP Agricultural Extension Project (Cr. 3308-IN) of
April 1981 covers the districts not included in the previous credit. MP is
also benefitting from two all-India ARDC line of credit projects, (the ARDC II
and III Projects, Credits 715-IN and 947-IN, respectively) which provide insti-
tutional credit for minor irrigation development, and other on-farm improve-
ments in physical infrastructure and farm equipment. The National Agricultural
Research Project (Cr 855-IN) in addition supports the MP Agricultural University.
II. THE PROJECT AREAS AND PRESENT DEVELOPMENT
Location
2.01      The two major on-going irrigation schemes--Mahanadi Reservoir (MRP),
and hasdeo Bango (hB)--are located in in Raipur, Bilaspur, Durg and Raigarh
Districts of the Chattisgarh region (Map IBRD 15146R) in the Southeastern
part of MP. General scheme area characteristics are shown in Table T-2.
2.02      The MRP scheme area (Map IBRD 15149R) lies almost entirely in the
Raipur District with a very small areas in the Durg and Bastar Districts. The
Mahanadi River forms the eastern boundary and the Rivers Kharun and Seonath,
the western and northern boundaries, the latter joining the Mahanadi River in
the northeastern corner of the scheme area.
2.03      The HB scheme area (Map IBRD 15148R) lies in Bilaspur and Raigarh
Districts and is bounded by Lilagar River and the existing Khurang tank to
the west, by the Mahanadi River to the south and HIand River to the east.
The scheme area is served from Hasdeo Barrage located near Korba town.
Climate
2.04      The project area 1/ has a sub-tropical monsoon climate characterized
by wet, hot summers and relatively warm, dry winters (Table T-3). Annual
rainfall in the region averages about 1,100 mm varying from 698 mm to 2,010
mm. Mean annual rainfall in IRP Scheme is 1,206 mm and in HB Scheme 1,386 mm.
The monsoon season (kharif) extends from late June to early October and
accounts for over 95% of the annual rainfall with two-thirds of the precipi-
tation occurring in July and August. Intervals between the on-set and reced-
ing of the monsoon varies considerably and monsoon duration is between 70 and
1/   The project area includes the command of  ERP, HB and Arpa schemes.



135 days with an average monsoon duration of some 100 days. Dry spells during
the monsoon generally last between three and ten days but can extend occasion-
ally to three weeks. The winter season (November to February) is relatively
warm and short with mean temperatures of 200 C between December and March,
followed by very hot and dry weather in May and June (400 C).  Temperatures
during the winter months in HB scheme are slightly lower than in MRP scheme
making them more favorable for rabi crops.
Topography and Soils (Table T-2)
2.05      Topography.  The project area is generally flat with slopes of less
than 1% over about half the scheme areas and from 1% to 3% in the remainder.
In general, micro-topography is determined by small rivers and natural drainage
ways. Most of the area has been bunded and land-shaped for rice cultivation.
The MRP command area lies at an elevation of 240-320 meters, with gently
undulating topography. Natural drainage is provided by numerous streams
draining into the Mahanadi and Seonath Rivers. The command area has fairly
good cross-slopes and is not likely to develop any extensive waterlogging with
increased irrigation use. The HB command area has also gently undulating
topography getting flatter as one approaches the Mahanadi River.   Natural
drainage is provided by five tributaries of the Mahanadi River and by some
important drainage ways (nallas).
2.06      Soils.  Detailed soil surveys have been completed over most of the
areas (Table T-2). The heavy texture and low permeability of the predominantly
clay loam soils are well suited for rice cultivation during the monsoon season.
In the MRP command, soils are derived from shales, limestone and sandstones
and are red-yellow latosols. The proportion of sandy loams and clay loams is
about 15% and 85%, respectively. In the HB command, soils are derived from
sandstones, shales, limestones and quartzite gneiss. Except for small areas
of eroded gravelly soils on the ridges (5%), they are deep to very deep and
vary in texture from sandy loam (15%) to sandy clay loam (17%), clay loam
(28%), and clay (31%).
Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.07      The average farm size in the project area is about 2.0 ha, ranging
from 1.6 ha in HB scheme to 2.3 ha in MRP scheme. Some 95% of the holdings
are wholly-owned and self-operated and the remainder partly owned and rented.
Distribution of holdings in each scheme is approximately as follows:
MRP        HB
Size - Class       No.  Area  No.  Area

Population and Labor Force
2.08      Population in the project area is estimated at 1.3 million consist-
ing of about 270,000 households. The labor force constitutes about 31% of
the total population with cultivators and agricultural laborers accounting
for about 58% and 34% of the labor force, respectively. The remaining 8%
are employed in industry, construction and mining (Table T-2).
Present Irrigation Development (Supplementary Data Volume (SDV), Annex 5)
2.09      MRP Scheme.  The development of the scheme commenced about the 1920s.
At present, it receives water from a complex of storage dams, carrier (feeder)
canals and diversion weirs linking various tributaries of the Mahanadi River
(Chart C-l). The river has an average annual flow of about 1,788 Mm3 at
the Ravishankar Sagar dam, the principal storage reservoir of the scheme
(SDV, Annex 8). Water from this dam also supplements supplies to the adjacent
Tandula system through a link canal for irrigation, municipal and industrial
uses. At full development, the MRP scheme will provide irrigation to about
374,000 ha. 1/
2.10      The MRP scheme was originally designed as a run-of-the-river diver-
sion scheme to irrigate about 85,000 ha. The primary objective at that time
was to provide "protective" irrigation to safeguard against disastrous failures
of kharif paddy crops. As the demand for irrigation increased, supplementary
storage reservoirs were added, the system underwent frequent remodelling
and the areas commanded gradually increased over the years. Currently, the
scheme provides water to about 224,000 ha. 1/ This expansion in area was
accompanied by a gradual reduction in the water supplied per ha irrigated at
the main canal headworks from about 7,000 m3/ha originally to about 3,000
m3/ha in the early 1970s. In 1977/78, when the Dudhawa reservoir (284
Mm3) was first filled to full capacity, the allocation again increased to
about 4,600 m3/ha irrigated. In 1979, construction started on the Adbanpur
Lift Irrigation Scheme serving about 13,000 ha within the command boundaries
of the existing MRP scheme (Map IBRD 15149R).
2.11      In spite of the increasing demand for irrigation water for new crop
varieties, "protective" irrigation is still in practice to this day. The
water supplied in the kharif season is inadequate in quantity and unreliable.
A comparison between the water supplied and the calculated water demand for
the years 1974 to 1979 (Table T-4) shows very considerable water supply defi-
ciencies due both to insufficient canal capacities and storage for the areas
commanded. During the critical period of flowering and grain setting (from
mid-September to the end of October), the releases ranged from 25% of the
requirements in 1974 to 66% in 1977.  Sometimes, water has been released
because of inadequate operational control, and canals run more or less con-
tinuougly even when there is no demand because of adequate rainfall; this
causes water wastage and drainage problems.
1/   This includes about 34,000 ha under the existing Pairi Irrigation Project
which will be operated as part of the MRP scheme after the completion of
the Pairi Dam and Pairi Link canal (see Chart C-1).



-9-
2.12      In 1978/79, Ravishankar Dam (767 Mm3) was commissioned but the
full impact of this additional storage cannot be fully reflected in present
production levels in the MRP command area while the canal capacity constraints
remain. However, before the industrial demand builds up and the existing
irrigation system served by Mahanadi Main Canal is enlarged, modernized and
extended, the additional storage should have a considerable effect on produc-
tion. This was taken into account in the economic analysis (see para 5.05).
Account has also been taken of storage available in Raviskankar reservoir and
the expected build up in industrial demand in estimating the increase in rabi
cultivation in the MRP command area.
2.13      Seepage losses in the conveyance system are about 4.5-6 cumecs/Mm2
(15-20 cusecs per M ft2), which is substantially higher than the design
assumptions of 1.8-2.4 cumecs/Mm2 (6-8 cusecs per M ft2) which were used for
establishing conveyance efficiencies for the project (SDV, Annex 13). There
are also no adequate control structures to regulate the flow. Once irrigation
starts, the system generally runs continuously with little change in the
regime except occasionally to stop the flow after very heavy rainfalls. The
ungated outlet pipes are easily tampered with and they do not provide constant
flows to the areas served. The outlets serve commands (chaks) which vary in
size from 40 ha to over 200 ha. Below these outlets, water distribution is
from field-to-field. Because of the unreliability of irrigation supplies both
in timing and quantity, farmers with holdings near the head of the "chaks"
retain excessive amounts of water and delay releases to farmers lower down the
chak. The outlet studies (SDV, Annex 6) have shown delays of up to a month
between headreach farmers receiving water and those farmers located at the
tail of the chak.
2.14      The existing design assumptions, standard of construction and opera-
tional procedures result in very serious water deficiencies for farmers near
the tail end of the systems. Even in the best years of water availability,
these "tailenders" do not receive a reliable and adequate water supply. As
a result, their agricultural production is very much less than those at the
head reaches. A number of outlet studies in the MRP scheme area were carried
out as part of project preparation in the 1979 and 1980 kharif seasons; the
results in 1979 (a severe drought year) indicate that some farmers at the head
of the system and near the outlets obtained paddy yields as high as 3.8 ton/ha
compared to as little as 0.3 ton/ha at the tailend of the main conveyance
network and farthest away from the project outlet (Table T-5). In 1980 (a
heavy rainfall year), distribution of crop yields showed a similar pattern
with yields of 2.6 tons/ha at the head of the system compared to 1.1 tons/ha
at the tail.
2.15      H1B Scheme.  This scheme was also originally designed as a run-
of-the-river diversion scheme. The Hasdeo Barrage was completed in 1967
together with a short length of the left bank main canal to provide cooling
water to the thermal power station at Korba. The right bank main canal and
the Janjgir branch canal, completed in 1976, provide irrigation to an area
of some 45,000 ha. The Akaltara branch canal, presently under construction,
could when completed, serve about 72,000 ha. Upstream of the Hasdeo Barrage,
the Bango dam is in the early stages of construction. When completed it will
provide the needed regulated flows to the irrigation scheme, to the Korba
thermal stations, and to other industrial users. Work is in progress on



- 10 -
extending the left bank main canal to serve three new branch canals. At full
development, the HB scheme will provide irrigation to about 255,000 ha.
2.16      Tne operation of the HB scheme began in 1977.  Until the Bango dam
is substanitially completed (1986), irrigation will be from the run-of-the-river
to present "protective irrigation" standards 1/ and will serve the existing
irrigated area and those that will be developed under the project. The exist-
ing irrigation system in HB scheme suffers similar design and construction
deficiencies and water supply and distribution constraints as MRP scheme (para
2.11).
2.17      Existing Implementation Constraints in Irrigation Development.  The
inherent deficiencies in the existing irrigation schemes are not only due to
the "outdated" planning and design concept but also to the inadequate imple-
mentation capacity in the Irrigation Department (ID). Existing irrigation
staff are trained to plan, design and construct schemes in accordance with
"protective" irrigation standards. Existing manpower is insufficient to design
and implement the large investments proposed in the project area. In parti-
cular, serious constraints exist in the planning and design of the distribu-
tion system (below main and branch canals) since most of the staff concentrate
on the design and construction of dams, main and branch canals and major struc-
tures. Furthermore, as construction and operation responsibilities are not
separated, operation and maintenance of the canal networks receive insufficient
attention from irrigation staff particularly as present financial provisions
for 5&M are limited (about US$4.6 per irrigated ha for MRP command area). In
view of the present staffing constraints and the change from "protective" to a
more intensive irrigation in MRP and RB schemes, the ID will require technical
assistance in planning, implementation and management of the schemes.
2.18      Groundwater.  The important aquifers in the project area are in
zones with carbonate rocks, shales and alluvium. Groundwater levels typically
are from 4-6 m below the surface. Most of the groundwater developed at
present is from dug-wells and dug-cum-bored wells. The quality of groundwater
is generally good. A preliminary groundwater balance in the scheme areas,
assuming extraction of groundwater remains at present levels, indicates that
the unexploited balances for MRP and HB schemes are about 570 Mm3 and 360 Mm3
or 94% and 97% of net recharge, respectively. 2/
2.19      Wells.  In the project area, wells have been dug principally for
domestic use. Well water is also used to cultivate early kharif and summer
paddy and some wheat and vegetables in the rabi season. About 8% of the
dug-wells in MRP and 34% in HB scheme areas have been energized. It is
expected that the current programs of groundwater development both by the AD
for dug-wells and the ID for tubewells will lead to a considerable increase
in groundwater use.
1/   Better control of the system will result in some improvement in crop
yields but as the timeliness of irrigation cannot be changed without
storage, a change to transplanted HYV paddy is not possible until the
Bango dam is operative.

2.20      Tanks.  There are large numbers of village tanks in the MRP and
HB scheme areas, principally used for domestic purposes. Larger tanks are
operated by the Irrigation Department and some have connections to the exist-
ing irrigation systems. Small village tanks are controlled by the Revenue
Department.
Present Agricultural Development
2.21      Agriculture in MRP and HB scheme areas is dominated by rice cultiva-
tion which occupies about 95% of the cropped area in the kharif season, with
follow-on crops of pulses and some linseed in rabi. Irrigated rabi crops
such as wheat and vegetables are grown on a small scale with water supplied
from wells and tanks. Most rabi crops are sown by broadcasting seed into the
standing paddy crop about two weeks before harvest to make use of residual
moisture in the soil. Present cropping patterns are summarized in Table T-17
and a detailed description of crops is provided in SDV, Annex 6.
2.22      Rice Cultivation.  About 10% and 5% of the rice crop is transplanted
in MRP and HB scheme areas, respectively, from seedlings grown in nurseries.
Transplanting is done only where timely supply of water is assured with the
nurseries either sown with the onset of the monsoon or from water supplied
from wells and tanks. The remaining rice area is cultivated by the tradi-
tional "biasi" method where paddy seeds are broadcast after a few good showers
confirm the arrival of monsoon, usually about the second half of June. From
three to six weeks later, the fields are cross plowed and planked to form a
rudimentary puddle to reduce excessive plant population and destroy some weeds.
This operation is followed by hand weeding and filling the gaps to obtain an
even crop stand. After these operations, paddy fields are filled with water
to about 15-20 cm depth and left submerged till the crops mature. Further
weedings during this period are usually performed and then fields are drained
and the paddy harvested. Under this traditional cropping practice, crop
failures are mainly due to inadequate rainfall or irrigation supplies in
September and October. However delays in the onset of the monsoon or early
breaks in the monsoon can cause delays in the "biasi" operation which results
in severe yield reductions.
2.23      Present Rice Yields.  Crop cutting experiments carried out in the
MRP scheme show that under traditional "biasi" practices, irrigation will only
increase yields on the average by 0.4 tons/ha, irrespective of the varieties
grown. With transplanting and use of high-yielding varieties (HYV), paddy
yields increase on average by about 1.0 ton/ha compared to local varieties
under irrigation and about 1.3 tons/ha compared to rainfed HYVs grown under
"biasi." Average present yields of paddy are:

2.24      In spite of the demonstrated superiority of transplanting HYVs under
irrigation, most cultivators have not changed from traditional cropping prac-
tices because of unreliable water supplies. For early transplanting, assured
water is required at the onset of the monsoon and this can only be supplied
from reservoir storage carried over from the previous monsoon. Present
storage is insufficient to provide this water. If farmers rely on monsoon
rainfall in the transplanting operation, undue delays may result in serious
reduction of crop yields. Since both the MRP and hB schemes are at present
designed to supplement rainfall, water is released in large quantities only in
September and October. The small area of rice under transplanted HYVs in both
scheme areas is generally supplied from wells or tanks.
Agricultural Supporting Services
2.25      Agricultural Research.  The Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya
Agricultural University (JNKVV) is responsible for agricultural research in
the project area. Six agricultural colleges under the University in different
regions of the State are under the control of the University and are located
at Jabalpur, Raipur, Indore, Gwalior, Rewa and Sehore. They act as regional
research stations and, in association with 16 research substations, provide
coverage of all the main agricultural zones of the State. Under the Madhya
Pradesh Agricultural Extension and Research Project, five college stations
(Jabalpur, Indore, Gwalior, Rewa and Sehore) are being developed as regional
research stations along with seven substations. These stations cover the
major agroclimatic variations found in these project districts and concentrate
on applied and adaptive research to provide practical answers to farmers'
problems. Efforts made to decentralize research under the Agricultural
Extension and Research Project have started producing results. Coordination
between research and extension has improved considerably in terms of mutual
exchange of information for formulation of seasonal programs, training of
extension staff by research workers, and frequency of field visits by research
workers to discuss problems with farmers and extension staff.
2.26      The Raipur College of Agriculture lies within the MRP command and
also maintains a research farm at Bilaspur, near to HB command area. The
Raipur College station is being developed as a regional center under the
IDA-assisted National Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 855-IN). The Raipur
College recently assumed responsibility for the GOHP-supported Rice Research
Institute (RRI) at Labandi in the MRP project area which is also a center for
the ICAR All-India coordinated Rice Research Program. The RRI was established
in 1922 and initially concentrated on selection and development of improved
rice varieties adapted to conditions in the region. Little attention has so
far been paid to better water management and to the introduction of rabi
crops. Research on fruit crops including bananas and on sugarcane is being
done at Bilaspur.
2.27      Agricultural Extension.  The T&V system of extension was introduced
in the Chambal MP command area in 1976 and later expanded to 15 districts
throughout the State under the MP Agricultural Extension and Research Project
(Cr. 712-IN). The extension program has given good results. Under the
recently approved Phase II Extension Project (Report No. 3308-IN), the whole



- 13 -
State will be covered by 1982/83. Bilaspur District (which includes the
HB command) was brought under the T&V system of extension in 1979. Raipur
District (which includes most of the MRP command) has been included in the
first phase of the Phase II Extension Project. Because of the large size
of Raipur District, it has been sub-divided into two extension districts,
each under a Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA). Within the scheme areas,
special attention will need to be paid to training farmers in efficient water
management and in nursery techniques for transplanted rice.
2.28      Agricultural Inputs.  To be fully effective, extension staff should
not be involved in coordinating input supplies and credit requirements, nor
associated with the administrative and regulatory duties. To handle these
tasks, under the Phase II extension project, a separate unit consisting of
one senior AEO and three VLW would be located in each development block and
linked directly with the district DDA. There would also be a Cooperative
Extension Officer (CEO) in each subdivision to ensure coordination with credit
and input organizations and for quick processing of loan applications. One
Supply Officer of the status of Assistant DA would be provided at the district
level to be responsible for regulatory functions and input arrangements. This
additional staff would free DDAs for frequent field visits so necessary to
review extension operations effectively.
2.29      Production of improved seed in the scheme areas has centered on
four State seed multiplication farms in Raipur district and four in Bilaspur
district which produce certified seed. Three farms of the Agricultural
University also produce foundation and certified seed. Under the Sixth Plan,
the AD will set up one additional farm of 250 ha near Kukda Weir in the Pairi
Irrigation Project command of Raipur district (Map IBRD 15149k). The AD has
also organized Seed Growers Cooperative Societies, each with about 20 members
who produce "truthfully labelled" rice seed which is procured by the District
Marketing Officer (DMO). Certified seed is distributed through the State
Marketing Corporation (MARKED). However quantities of quality seed are
insufficient and a State Seed and Farm Corporation has recently been set
up to gradually take over the farms from the AD and to contract farmers to
produce quality seeds. An independent State Seed Certification Agency has
also been set up and existing seed testing laboratories are being strengthened.
2.30      Distribution of fertilizers is undertaken mainly by MARKED, a public
undertaking which arranges for the required supplies from the manufacturers
as well as from the central pool to dispatch supplies direct to District
headquarters. The District Marketing Officer (DMO) sells fertilizer on credit
to branches of the Central Cooperative Bank at block level. On payment to the
bank, supplies are released to village level primary cooperative societies who
distribute fertilizer to farmers. About 60% of fertilizer is sold through the
cooperative sector with the remainder supplied through licensed private dealers.
In spite of the wide distribution network, farmers in many districts have
difficulty in obtaining timely supplies of fertilizers. One of the major
constraints in popularizing use of fertilizers has been reluctance of coopera-
tives to procure stocks from suppliers in advance of the sowing season for fear
of increasing losses due to uncertain sales and long storage. To help overcome
this problem, GOMP proposes to subsidize transport and storage of fertilizers
(with provision of Rs 22.5 M during the Sixth Plan period). The present level
of demand in the project area is low; 10 kg of nutrient per ha of crop in
Raipur district and 7 kg per ha in Bilaspur district.



- 14 -
2.31      Marketing of pest control chemicals is handled by the Agro Indus-
tries Development Corporation and a network of private dealers. During the
Sixth Plan, GOMP proposes to encourage pest control measures by offering
advantageous storage charges on agro-chemicals and to increase the stock
of spraying equipment held by the Department of Agriculture.
2_32      Foodgrain storage capacity is being increased in both scheme areas.
Uader a European Economic Community (EEC) assisted program started in 1979,
additional storage capacity is to be constructed in the MRP and HB scheme
areas. Arrangements for foodgrain storage capacity is adequate for develop-
ment proposed under the project.
2a33      Bullocks are the main source of farm power.  The relatively small
size of holdings and of individual paddy fields are not conducive to mechani-
zation.  Frequent shortages of diesel fuel also make farmers reluctant to
invest in expensive machinery. Farmers will continue to rely on available
bullock power which averages one pair per 2.4 ha in MRP and 4.0 ha in HB
command areas. Mechanical threshers are becoming popular with the extension
of electrification,
2.34      Credit.  The organization of institutional credit to farmers follows
the usual pattern in India. The cooperative banks provide short (up to one
year) and medium term credit (one to five years) to farmers through primary
cooperative societies. The societies are organized on a three-tier basis with
the State Cooperative Bank at State level, District Cooperative Banks (DC) at
District level (two DCBs in the project area) and Primary Credit Societies
(PCS) at village level. There are 860 PCSs in the project area. Long-term
loans (over five year term) are available to farmers through the Land Develop-
ment Banking system. Credit is also available through the Commercial Banks
(68 and 50 branches in Raipur and Bilaspur Districts, respectively) and the
Regional Rural Banks (17 in Raipur District and 26 in Bilaspur District).
Small Farmers' Development Agency (SFDA) programs are operated in both Dis-
tricts serving about 63,000 participants.
2935      Marketing of agricultural produce is less developed in MP than in
many other States. During the Sixth Plan period, a regulated market, or at
least a market yard, is planned for every community development block. In the
project area, the MRP scheme is served by 9 regulated markets and 8 sub-markets
of which the most important are at Raipur, Navapara, Dhamtari and Bhatapara.
The HB scheme is served by eight regulated markets and sub-markets, the most
important being at Akaltara, Champa, Mungeli and Shakti. The present marketing
facilities are considered to be adequate for the project.
2.36      Processing.  Raipur district has about 130 rice mills of which only
about one third are utilized in average production years. Eighteen mills in
the cooperative sector are of the modern type equipped with rubber rollers.
in addition, there is adequate capacity in villages to process paddy for local
consumption. Bilaspur district also has a considerable excess of capacity
with about 120 rice mills of which 16 are in the cooperative sector. There
are five bran extraction plants in or close to the project area and other
facilities include flour, oil, and pulse mills which can handle existing pro-
duction. Processing facilities, with on-going expansion plans, are adequate
for the project period.

III. THE PROJECT
Project Formulation and Objectives
3.01      The project was formulated in the 1970s by the technical departments
of GOMP and was reviewed and cleared at that time by the Central Water Commis-
sion (CWC) of GOI. Bank involvement started in May 1979 when WAPCOS 1/ were
retained by GOMP to prepare a Feasibility Report for the project on their
behalf (to Bank standards). It quickly became evident that considerable
updating and revision to designs would be necessary if the project objectives
set by GOMP were to be fulfilled and the sunk investments in the project area
were to be fully utilized. The main shortcomings in the original COMP proposal
were that crop water requirements were under-estimated, system efficiencies
were too optimistic, insufficient regulation was provided, and the distribu-
tion system was incomplete. There was also little consideration for the need
for complementary investments in development areas such as village roads,
farming system research and water management.
3.02      Following the revision of the original GOMP project concepts, both
MRP and HB schemes will now be designed for more modern irrigation service
which should result in a gradual transformation from the traditional broadcast
method of planting kharif paddy (biasi) to the transplanting of HYV (see para
2.22). Most of the varieties introduced under the project are expected to
be of short duration (120-135 days). This change is expected to about double
the present crop yields with transplanted HMY's expected to cover about 70%
of the area at full development.
3.03      The priorities for use of reservoir water in the two schemes have
been set by GOMP. Priority would be given to industrial and urban supplies;
water available in the reservoirs for irrigation use would then be allocated
to mature the late kharif paddy if the monsoon ends early with adequate water
being set aside for early transplanting of paddy in the following kharif sea-
son. Residual water quantities in the reservoirs at the end of the rainy
season which have not been allocated to industrial and urban users would be
allocated for rabi crops. This would mean that the rabi area which can be
irrigated annually would vary with the amount and distribution of rainfall
from year to year. Storage water available for rabi irrigation in MRP command
will be less than in the HB command. As rainfall is also somewhat higher in
the HB command and more storage per area developed will be available; thus a
higher percentage of early transplanted paddy will be possible in HB command,
together with more rabi cropping and the growing of some perennials and hot
weather crops.
3.04      The pattern of water use in the areas already under irrigation
in the MRP and HB schemes is clearly influenced by the distribution of land
holdings. Larger farmers normally have their holdings at the head reaches of
the distribution system, with heavier concentration of small and poor farmers
1/   Water and Power Consultancy Services, an undertaking of the Government
of India.



- 16 -
at the tailends where water supply is unreliable and insufficient. The con-
veyance systems to be constructed under the project would be designed so that
water could be supplied in a timely and reliable manner to all areas of the
command. The canal system down to the 40 ha outlets would be lined except
where such lining is found to be unnecessary, in order to reduce conveyance
losses, the time of transmission of flow and to facilitate the operation of
the surplus. The canal systems would be provided with sufficient cross-
regulators and measuring weirs to enable effective water distribution to be
made. Conveyance of water between the 40 ha outlets and the 8 ha turnouts
will continue in earthen ditches until such time as the benefit of lining
these sub-minor channels can be confirmed for the range of physical conditions
throughout the project areas. 1/
3.05      The project will be designed to:
(a)  complete planned storage reservoirs needed to fully develop
available water resources and serve the projected command areas;
(b)  enlarge canal capacities to meet peak water requirements
and provide sufficient control structures so that the canal
systems can respond adequately and efficiently to the
changing seasonal and annual water demands;
(c)  reduce existing outlet commands to serve about 40 ha;
(d)  line all feeder, main and branch canals.  Distributaries
and minors which bring water down to outlets serving an
area of some 40 ha each would also be lined except where
found unnecessary as a result of tests and observations
that would indicate that lining would be uneconomical in
these reaches (e.g. solid rock, impervious soils, etc.);
(e)  extend the conveyance system beyond the 40 ha outlet down
to turnouts serving about 8 ha; and
(f)  improve the implementation and management capabilities
of the executing agencies (Irrigation Department).
Agreement has been reached with GOMP that it would implement the project
works in accordance with the agreed planning criteria, design and construction
standards and operational procedures acceptable to IDA.
3.06      To promote better water use at the farm level, the project also
supports research activities and a program for construction of channels and
on-farm development below the 8 ha turnouts (para 3.26). Monitoring and
evaluation will be introduced to provide continuous feedback to project
designers and operating personnel.
3.07      The schemes would take about 15 to 20 years to develop fully.  At
present, uncertainties still exist in estimating (i) the actual conveyance
1/   A comprehensive program for lining these small channels has been included
in the project so that their performance and farmer response can be
monitored and evaluated.



- 17 -
and operational efficiencies achievable with the new design standards and
operational procedures; (ii) crop water requirements with respect to the
contribution of effective rainfall and the practicality of spreading crop
planting dates; and (iii) the changes that farmers would introduce in the
design cropping patterns, as a result of a more reliable and timely water
supply. To reduce these uncertainties, a flexible approach to project design
has been adopted. Construction of the main canal networks would be carried
out in stages with initial canal capacities based on water requirements cal-
culated from the estimated future cropping patterns but allowing for the
projected gradual increase in the areas irrigated. However, the structures
along the canals would be designed to allow passage of larger flows. 1/ In
the future, if necessary, the channel design is such that the canals can be
enlarged at relatively low cost to carry larger peak flows (SDV, Annex 9).
Water Supply and Demand (SDV, Annex 7)
3.08      The water supply for the MRP and HB schemes is obtained from river
flows which are regulated by a complex of storage reservoirs and feeder canals
in the upper Mahanadi River basin. The water balance studies are based on a
30-year rainfall and streamflow correlations. They take into account upstream
irrigation use, domestic and industrial water demand, effective rainfall,
reservoir inflows, evaporation and spills, and estimated irrigation demands
in the command areas. Crop water requirements have been calculated in accor-
dance with FAO Publication No. 24 utilizing the modified Penman method of
estimating potential evapotranspiration and relating to the projected cropping
patterns. Reservoir operation studies were conducted to establish monthly
shortages which would be likely to occur over a 30-year period. For the MRP
scheme, the reservoir studies indicate that serious water shortages in the
kharif season at full development (Table T-6) that would adversely affect
paddy yields in about 5 out of 30 years. For the HB scheme, the water balance
indicates serious shortages for only one year out of 30 years for the kharif
paddy crop (Table T-7).
3.09      Groundwater and small surface tanks could have an important role to
play in the development of the schemes. In particular, groundwater and tank
water could supply rice nurseries before project canals are opened for kharif
irrigation. It is also expected that groundwater will play an increasingly
important role for rabi and hot weather irrigation and provide good quality
village water supplies.
Project Scope
3.10      The project would finance a five-year time slice of an on-going
development program. Construction works would be limited to the MRP and
HB schemes which at full development in 15 to 20 years would serve about
374,000 2/ and 255,000 ha, respectively. Detailed planning and design work

on Pairi Dam together with some works required for additional
improvements on three existing dams (Murumsilli, Dudhawa and
Sikasar). Construction of a new diversion weir at Rudri serv-
ing Mahanadi Main Canal; construction of about 46 km of feeder
canals; remodelling of about 49 km of main canal; blocks dev-
elopment of about 69,000 ha of canal distribution system down
to 40 ha outlets with unlined sub-minors to 8 ha turnouts

(h)  monitoring and evaluation.
Detailed Description
3.12      Dams and Weirs (Table T-8).  In the MRP Scheme, construction activi-
ties on the partially completed Sondur Dai which is at present about 32%
complete. The dam will store some 180 Mm and comprises earth embankments,
a masonry non-overflow and spillway section.  The original design allowed for
four radial gates on the spillway crest. Recent design flood calculations
indicated the need for a fifth gate which has been installed. Preliminary
works Iould commence on the Pairi Dam designed for a reservoir storage of some
420 Mm . Additional design work will be carried out and resettlement from the
rSservoir area would be planned. A new weir with diversion capacity of 375
m /sec will be constructed upstream of the existing Rudri weir for diverting
river flows into the enlarged Mahanadi Main Canal. Parapet walls will be
constricted to increase the freeboard on Murumsilli jam (storage capacity
162 M4m ) and on Dudhawa dam (storage capacity 284 Mm ). Works on the



- 20 -
existing Sikasar dam would include rehabilitation work of the spillway section;
in addition r dial gates are being installed to increase storage volume from
136 to 266 Mm . Also a parapet wall will be constructed to improve dam safety
by increasing the freeboard.
3.13      In the HB Scheme, construction activities would continue on the
Bango Dam.  About 8% of construction 3is already complete.  The dam will ha;e
a storage capacity of about 3,050 Mm and comprises a masonry main section
(698 m in length) and three earth saddle dams with a combined crest length of
1,990 m. Provision would be made for penstocks to serve three power units
each of 40 M1W.
3.14      Dam Safety.  Improvements in the design and construction methods of
the dams have been recommended by GOI and IDA to GOMP and will be implemented.
Existing dams within the scheme areas have been found adequate subject to minor
modifications (see SDV, Annex 8). To ensure the safety of the dams submitted
for financing under the project, a panel of experts 1/ has been constituted by
GOMP with qualifications, experience and terms of reference acceptable to IDA.
Agreements have been reached with GOMP that it would (i) maintain a Dam Review
Panel which has been set up with qualifications, experience and terms of refer-
ence acceptable to IDA; (ii) the panel would review the plans and designs of
the dams and their associated structures, and would conduct periodic reviews,
during design and construction, to examine whether any new grounds for making
changes in the design of the dam have become apparent; (iii) after construc-
tion, have the dams and related structures submitted for financing under
the project, periodically inspected to determine any deficiencies that might
endanger their safety, and (iv) propose appropriate inspection arrangements
for IDA review not less than one year before the expected completion of each
dam.
3.15      The Panel's role is not to be viewed as one of assisting or guiding
the ID, since responsibility for proper design and construction, including
quality control, rests with GOMP. Rather, it should be considered as a review
body of technical experts whose judgement and opinions on particular actions
by the project administration would carry considerable weight in the evalua-
tion of proposed actions.
3.16      MRP Feeder Canals (Table T-9).  Feeder canals would be designed to
a capacity required to efficiently operate the parent reservoirs (Chart C-l).
The canals would be lined to reduce losses and to provide a cost effective
cross section. Adequate control structures would be provided to enable direct
command areas to be served. Bridges and cross drainage structures would be
constructed along the alignment of the canals. The feeder canals to be
constructed under the project would include:
(a) Completion of Sondur Feeder Canal to enable storage from
Sondur reservoir to be passed to Dudhawa reservoir for use
1/   Terms of reference for the Dam Safety Panel are given in Annex 2(b).



- 21 -
in MRP command area through Ravishankar Reservoir; the
canal would be 15 km in length and pass about 28 M /sec.
(b)  Completion of Mahanadi/Tandula Feeder Canal to link
Ravishankar Dam with the Tandula canal system and pass
supplies to industrial users (Bhilai Steel Works) and
domestic users (Raipur and Bhilai towns).  Th   canal
would be 42 km in length and carry about 20 M /sec.
(c)  Preliminary works on the Pairi Feeder Canal to enable trans-
fer of storage from Pairi reservoir to Rudri diversion weir
for use in the Mahanadi Main Canal System.
3.17      Main and Branch Canals.  In the MRP scheme, the project would remodel
and line about 49 km of the main canal. A flexible approach of staged con-
struction would be adopted for channels with capacities above 40 m3/sec.
During the first stage development, canals would be constructed with capacities
related to about 280 m3/sec diversion at the head 1/ of the Mahanadi Main
Canal. The main canal is designed so that it can be enlarged in the future
to about 375 m3/sec. Improved control and adequate escapes enables encroach-
ment on the lined freeboard of the canals for short periods of peak demand.
For channels with a carrying capacity less than about 40 M3/sec, encroach-
ment on the lined freeboard would accommodate peak discharges for the fully
developed project. All structures would be designed to pass discharges
related to 375 m3/sec at the head regulator of the Mahanadi Main Canal.
3.18       In the HB scheme, the project would remodel and line about 97 km
of main and branch canals on the right bank and construct about 16 km on the
left bank. Canals would be designed for the equivalent of about 117 m3/sec
at the main canal head diversion on the right bank and about 138 m3/sec at
the main canal head of the left bank. 2/
3.19      All main and branch canals in the project would be lined to:  (i)
reduce seepage losses particularly during the rabi seasons; (ii) to reduce
maintenance needs; and (iii) to improve operational efficiency. In addition,
lining of canals will reduce the channel section compared to earthen channel
of the same discharge capacity resulting in cost saving of structures, land
acquisition and earthworks. The type of lining used for main and branch
canals would depend on channel capacity, availability of materials and the
construction methods most appropriate to the site. Generally, the lining
would be of 75 mm thick "in situ" concrete (1:3:6) both for bed and side
slopes laid on 100 gauge polythene sheets. Selected "murrum" backfill would
be provided if the channel alignment passes through soils with swelling
properties.
I/   Equivalent to about 0.9 1/sec/ha at the head diversion of the Mahanadi
Main Canal for the command area of 340,000 ha.
2/   This is equivalent to about 1.0 1/sec/ha at the main canal head diversion
for 117,000 ha of the right bank command and 138,000 ha of the left bank
command.

3.20      Canal Distribution Systems.  The irrigation systems below branch
canals consist of distributary canals, minors and sub-minors. Typically, a
distributary canal commands an area of about 2,000 ha. A distributary conveys
water to minors, each serving on average 200-250 ha. Areas served by a minor
would be sub-divided into outlet commands ("chaks") of about 40 ha. Water
from a minor would be supplied to these chaks through gated outlet structures.
Sub-minors would convey water from the 40 ha outlets to turnouts commanding
about 8 ha. The development of the distribution system would be on a block-
by-block I/ basis with each block constructed so that it is fully operational
on completion. In the first time slice of five years, about 69,000 ha would
be fully developed in the ikP scheme and 85,000 ha in the RB scheme. Detailed
design criteria for the canal distribution systems is given in the SDV,
Annex 9.
3.21      Distributaries and minors would be lined (see 3.05(d)) . Generally
the channel sides would be lined with precast concrete slabs 5 cms thick laid
on a 20 mm cement-mortar bed over a thin polythene sheet; joints would be
filled with 1:4 cement-sand mortar. The channel bed would be in-situ con-
crete. Field testing of various types of lining would continue throughout
the project period and specifications would be modified if improvements are
necessary or a more cost effective design proves to be practical. Since the
benefits of lining sub-minors in paddy areas have not been confirmed, the
program of lining sub-minors would initially be limited to about 8,000 ha
under the project so that design specifications, costs and benefits of this
program can be evaluated (see para 3.33). The program would be undertaken
where lining of sub-minors is likely to be most beneficial (such as the
Abdanpur Lift Irrigation Scheme) and to demonstrate the component as widely
as possible throughout both MRP and HB scheme areas.
3.22       Drainage.  Main drainage exist in the form of natural waterways.
However, minor drainage channels from the terraced paddy fields are required
to remove expeditiously excess rainfall during the monsoon season. Drainage
ditches would have capacities of about 10 1/sec/ha. Link drains would be
provided where necessary to remove the water to nearest drainage ways. Under
the project, minor drainage would be provided for completed irrigation blocks
(154,000 ha). Bridges and culverts would be provided to maintain access.
3.23      Canal Structures (Table T-9).  Most of the canal structures in the
existing irrigated areas, except for some major drainage structures, bridges
and culverts, have reached the end of their useful life, or have been designed
to standards which do not enable the regulation required for the efficient
distribution of water. Also the substantial increase in peak canal discharge
and change in canal cross sections will make most structures unsuitable for
further service.  Concurrent with the canal modernization and lining programs,
all canals would be provided with (i) modern flow regulating structures; (ii)
drops and bridges; (iii) escapes; and (iv) sufficient flow measuring devices.
Design criteria are summarized in SDV, Annex 9.
I/   "Block-by-block" development would be undertaken concurrently with the
major works program so that in each irrigation block, all the infrastruc-
ture down to the 8 ha turnouts would be completed before work commences
on a new block.



- 23
3.24      Road Networks.  The project would improve and extend about 672 km of
rural roads to provide adequate access for farmers, transport of agricultural
inputs and for marketing of produce. A detailed description of road planning
criteria and design standards is given in SDV, Annex 10.
3.25      The roads would be planned to enable:  (i) all parts of the command
area to be brought within about 3 km of an all-weather road; and (ii) all
villages with 1,500 or more population to be linked by all-weather roads to
existing main road systems. Project roads would be designed and constructed
as all-weather roads in accordance with Indian koads Congress (IRC) standards
and specifications. Pavements would be of waterbound macadam construction
with the addition of a 20 mm pre-mix bitumen carpet and a seal coat on selec-
ted sections of the roads.  The right-of-way would normally be 25 m but this
may be reduced in cultivated areas to some 15 m. The minimum formation would
be 7.5 m with pavement widths of 5.5 m and 3.5 m, respectively, for double and
single lane roads.
3.26      Sub-chak Channels.  The project would provide for the construction
of channels from the turnouts serving the 8 ha sub-chaks to individual farms
or to 2 ha borders where individual holdings are small and also for construc-
tion of drains as required.   The program, covering about 13,500 ha in the
MRP scheme and about 2,000 ha in HB scheme will evaluate and demonstrate the
benefits of delivering irrigation supplies to indiv:idual farms in the kharif
and rabi seasons.
3.27      Farming Systems Research (SDV, Annex 11).  In the past, research
on irrigated agriculture in the Chattisgarh region has concentrated mainly
on development and testing of new rice varieties for rainfed conditions and
for existing project conditions where water is supplied to suit a broadcasted
paddy crop. Only limited attention has been given to better farm practices
for the future. The project provides for a program of adaptive research to
be conducted principally on farmers fields, to identify and demonstrate new
cultural techniques and practices. The program is similar to that devised
by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). Two field sites (each
covering at least a 40 ha area) would be established in both MRP and RB scheme
areas.
3.28      Statewide Hydrological Network (SDV, Annex 13).  Funds are included
under the project to establish a statewide network of recording rain gauges,
stream gauging and silt recording stations. Emphasis will be given to con-
verting existing stage recording stations which have obsolete measurement
procedures into modern stations which can accurately measure run-off and
record flow rates. Sediment determinations would be made at selected key
stations. Each existing station or new site would be provided with either
a cable way, or a boat (if a highway bridge is not available) and modern
equipment will be installed for measuring and recording stream discharge.
A Directorate for Hydrometeorology would be established in the Irrigation
Department to analyze and process hydrological data and provide technical
assistance and supervision to field personnel operating the stations. In
addition to equipment and construction costs, financing would be provided
for incremental staff necessary to implement the network at the State level
and in four river basin headquarters.



- 24 -
Arpa Scheme Preparation
3.29      The project would provide finance to undertake the additional
surveys and investigations of the Arpa scheme so that detailed scheme prepara-
tion can be completed. The works would include survey and investigation of
the main dam site and major structures on the main canals. In addition, the
scheme command area would be surveyed and detailed irrigation layouts prepared
to the same standards as MRP and HB schemes. Apart from preliminary works,
such as access roads to the dam site, implementation of the Arpa scheme is
not scheduled within the time-slice financed under the project.
Operation and Maintenance Facilities
3.30      The project would provide a modern communication network for the
reservoirs and irrigation systems in both MRP and hB schemes. Equipment would
include radio communications and telemetering to connect all reservoirs, main
control points on the distribution system and the management centers. Equip-
ment and vehicles for efficient operation and effective maintenance of the
schemes would also be provided. Buildings would be constructed for use during
the construction stage and located so that they can be handed over to O&M
staff when construction works are completed. Funds for the O&M facilities are
included in the civil works costs of MRP and _B schemes, respectively, since
equipment and buildings will be used during the construction stage and handed
over to management units as works are commissioned. Detailed lists of equip-
ment are given in SDV, Annex 14.
3.31      Technical Assistance (Annex 2).  In its Sixth Plan, GOHP has com-
mitted itself to a significant increase in irrigation investments, consistent
with the priorities in both State and National Plans. These commitments
include the Medium Irrigation Project as well as the large inter-State
projects--particularly in the Narmada Basin--which is also likely to be
IDA-financed. This situation, combined with the fact that the Project
Preparation and Monitoring (PPM) Cells in the ID and AD are in their infancy,
will place a heavy burden on existing ID staff and may delay project imple-
mentation. Experience in MP as well as elsewhere in India has also indicated
that constraints in implementation generally occur in the completion of the
distribution system networks. In addition, the Irrigation Department (ID) is
at present seriously understaffed and the newly recruited irrigation engineers
will not have adequate experience to plan, design and supervise construction
of the project to the more modern standards required (see para 2.17). There-
fore, the project will finance the employment of locally recruited Indian
consultants from both the public and the private sector as follows:
(a) General Consultants would assist the ID in the planning of
the works; drawing up the yearly implementation programs;
in data collection; evaluation for the planning and design
of subsequent phases of project implementation (second
timeslice). They will also assist the ID in evaluating
how the groundwater potential in the project area can be
developed, advise the ID on operation and maintenance of
the systems, and assist in the preparation of O&M manuals.



- 25 -
(b) The ID would contract with engineering firms to undertake
the survey work and the planning and design of the irriga-
tion and drainage systems below distributary canal head
regulators to be constructed in the irrigation blocks under
MRP and HB schemes (154,000 ha).
Detailed Terms of Reference for the General Consultants and engineering firms
are given in Annex 2 and the estimated costs are summarized in Table 7, Annex
4(a). Agreements has been reached with GOMP that it would retain engineering
consultants with terms of reference, experience and qualifications acceptable
to IDA to: (i) provide general planning assistance to the Irrigation Depart-
ment as described in Annex 2; and (ii) undertake on a contract basis the
survey, planning and design of the canal distribution systems and minor
drainage serving about 154,000 ha in the command areas of MRP and HB schemes.
3.32      The MP Medium Irrigation Project (Cr. 1108-IN) has provided funds
for a component which will represent the first stage of training for the
management of irrigation projects in MP and could provide the basis for the
establishment of a large-scale training institute at a later date. Funds have
been provided under MP Major Irrigation Project for: (i) classroom courses
particularly for the additional staff which will have to be recruited or
trained to enable the implementation schedule to be met in a timely manner
(see para 4.06); (ii) field visits to operating projects in MP, other States,
and, for senior management and specialists, overseas; and (iii) for workshops/
seminars run by specialists/consultants so that the benefit of improved
design, monitoring and evaluation of completed works and management techniques
can be shared as widely as possible. The General Consultants (para 3.31)
would assist and advise the ID on training requirements of the project.
3.33      Monitoring and Evaluation (SDV, Annex 12).  The project would
provide funds for equipment, vehicles and staff for project monitoring and
evaluation and also for special studies using consultants and services from
universities and research institutions in India. A detailed description of
the activities is given in para 4.13.
Status of Project Preparation
3.34      Major works under the project including dams, diversion weirs and
the channel and structures of main canals are designed as individual works.
Detailed designs of works below branch canal head regulators are made using
type 1/ designs for channels and structures adapted to suit actual site con-
ditions. Once the block command areas are surveyed, irrigation and drainage
layouts can be decided on topographic considerations, and detailed designs
can be prepared using the type designs. The ID has prepared the type designs
necessary for project implementation, based on design principles and criteria
formulated by their Project Preparation Consultants.  The type designs to
be used under the project have been reviewed and approved by IDA. Sufficient
1/   A type design of a channel or structure is such that for a range of canal
capacities, the design can be used throughout the project command areas
with only minor modifications.



- 26 -
sample irrigation and drainage layouts have been prepared to estimate project
costs. The ID has made provisions acceptable to IDA to ensure that detailed
designs will be available in a timely manner to meet the project implementa-
tion schedule.
3.35      Of the major works, Sondur and Bango dams are under construction
to designs which have been reviewed by IDA and will be checked out by the Dam
Safety Panel. Detailed project preparation has been completed for the feeder,
main and branch canals to be undertaken in the first year of the project (upto
June 30, 1982). Of the major works, only Rudri weir (MRP scheme) is at a
preliminary design stage but construction of this structure is not scheduled
to commence until about January 1983. The ID expects to complete the detailed
design of Rudri weir by harch 1982 for review by IDA. About 12,000 ha of block
development would be constructed under the project during the first year in
areas where irrigation layouts have been prepared and earthworks and structures
are under construction. Designs of this on-going construction program have
been modified to conform to project design criteria. The additional survey
required to finalize the layouts of the irrigation systems below the 40 ha
outlet will be completed by December 1981. The works below the 40 ha outlet
would be implemented under small piecework or rate contracts (see para 3.40)
during the first year of construction.
Implementation Schedule (Chart C-2)
3.36      The project would be implemented over five years from July 1, 1981
to June 30, 1986. The main construction season is from September to May,
although certain activities, particularly on major works, can continue through-
out the monsoon season. Provisional schedules of individual works to be
implemented in the first year of construction are given in SDV, Annex 14.
3.37      In the past, utilization of water has been slow and inequitable
after the completion of the main conveyance system. This was because the
minor distribution system was not constructed fully or concurrently with water
being available in the main and branch canals. In many cases, when minor
systems were built, they were planned, designed and constructed to low stand-
ards, without adequate survey work and with insufficient attention to the
quality of service that the minor irrigation system should provide. As a
result water does not reach the lower ends of the system and the "tailender"
problem resulted. Similar problems occur within the individual chaks (40 ha
to 200 ha) throughout the irrigation systems. Under the project, the distri-
bution system would be remodelled and constructed on a block-by-block basis
concurrently with completion of the main system. Once construction of the
minor system is completed, water can be delivered to the 8 ha turnouts within
the blocks in a reliable and timely manner. Construction work would be
scheduled with a minimum interruption of water deliveries to existing irri-
gation systems. Farmers will be informed of canal closures at least one crop
season ahead to enable them to make suitable adjustments in their cropping
patterns.
3.38      The road construction program would be concentrated in the areas
where irrigation blocks are to be developed (154,000 ha). Upgrading of
existing roads would be decided after a detailed survey of their condition.



- 27 -
Since this data is not complete, appropriate surveys and investigations would
be undertaken in the first year of the project and the road program would be
reviewed on an annual basis.
Cost Estimates
3.39      The total project cost, over the five-year time-slice, is estimated
at US$439 M including taxes and duties which are insignificant. This includes
a foreign exchange component of about US$63 M or 14% of project cost. The
provision for physical contingencies range between 7% and 20% depending on
the status of designs and average at 11% for all civil works. Engineering,
design and administration is estimated at about 12% of the civil works cost
and include costs of engineering services retained by the ID for survey,
planning and design (para 3.31). Detailed costs of all civil works and
equipment have been updated to reflect July 1981 contract prices. Expected
price increases during the project period are taken as 9.5% in 1981, 8.5%
in 1982 and 7.5% thereafter. Cost estimates are given in Tables T-10 through
T-13, detailed in Annex 4 and summarized below:

Financing
3040      The proposed IDA credit of US$220 M would finance the foreign exchange
component (US$63 M or about 14% of total project cost) and about 42% of local



- 28 -
cost. All expenditures would be met from GOMP's development budget which
includes a GOI contribution. The credit would be made to GOI on standard
terms. An assurance would be sought from GOI that it would make the proceeds
of the credit available to GOMP on GOI's standard terms and arrangements for
development assistance to the States. Agreements have been reached with
GOMP, that: (i) sufficient resources (in particular scarce materials such
as cement and steel) would be provided to execute the project in accordance
with the implementation schedule (Chart C-2) and the project schedule of
expenditures; and (ii) it would complete the MRP and HB schemes as soon as
technically and financially feasible after the credit has been disbursed.
Procurement (SDV, Annex 14)
3.41      Civil works financed under the project would cost approximately
US$322 million, excluding engineering and administration. Of this, about
US$94 M or 29% of the civil works, would be let through International Compe-
titive Bidding contracts (ICB), and about US$151 M (or 47%) would be let
through Local Competitive Bidding contracts (LCB), and the remaining US$77 M4
(or 24%) would be let under piecework contracts or be carried out by GOMP's
departmental forces. All ICB and LCB contracts, approximately US$245 million
(or 76%) of the civil works, would be let on the basis of standardized docu-
ments and procedures recently developed by GOI's Central Water Commission and
approved by the Bank Group. Works in excess of US$1.0 M would be subject to
IDA's pre-action procurement review, 80% by value of the civil works, with
the remaining subject to IDA post-review.
(a) ICB Contracts for Major Dam and MIain Canal Works (US$94 M).
Works for dams and main canals in excess of US$6 M per con-
tract would be let on the basis of ICB in accordance with
the Bank Group's procurement guidelines. To encourage the
participation of larger contractors, similar works would
be packaged where practical for bidding. However, to gain
the interest of smaller contractors, the bid package would
be designed also to allow bidding for all or any part of the
works. Indian contractors would be entitled to a 7.5% pre-
ference for the purpose of bid evaluation. Tender documents
would specify this preference and the manner of its applica
tion.
(b) LCB Contracts (US$142 M). These works would be individually
small (less than US$6 M per contract), scattered over a
large area, and carried out intermittently as determined
by weather conditions and agricultural activities. They
would therefore not be suitable for international tendering.
(c)  On-Going Contracts (US$9 M).  Six civil works contracts have
been let between December 1980 when the project was appraised
and July 1, 1981 when the five-year time-slice covered by
the project was expected to start. These contracts were not
suitable for ICB for the same reasons as described above and
were let after LCB on the basis of CWC's standardized procedures



- 29 -
and guidelines. An estimated USS9  M worth oE works is out-
standing under such contracts. Works outstanding after
July 1, 1981 under such on-going contracts would be eligible
for financing from the proposed credit.
(d)  Non-ICB/LCB Works (US$77 M).  These works would also be
individually small and scattered, and their implementation
would be governed by weather and agricultural conditions.
Because of these and other technical constraints, there
would be a general lack of interest from contractors located
outside the areas covered by the project. These works would
therefore be impractical for ICB or LCB tendering; most of
them would instead be carried out under small piece-work
or rate contracts. When required by safety or quality con-
siderations or when the quantities of work are difficult
to estimate in advance, small works may be implemented by
GONP's departmental forces. Works executed departmentally
or on the basis of piece-work or rate contracts would be
limited to an aggregate of 25% of the civil works included
in the project.
3.42      Equipment, Instruments and Vehicles (Table T-13) to be financed
under the project would cost approximately US$18 M excluding price contin-
gencies.  All heavy equipment with an estimated cost of US$9 M, equivalent
to 50% of the value of all equipment, instruments and vehicles included in
the project, would be procured through ICB procedures A preference limited
to 15%, or the prevailing customs duty if lower, would be extended to local
manufacturers in the evaluation of bids. The equipment, instruments and
vehicles would be grouped to promote efficiency and attract competition;
however, bids will also be accepted on individual schedules to attract small
manufacturers. The balance (US$9 i1) comprising light equipment, instruments
and vehicles, would be procured locally in order that they could benefit from
existing servicing and spare parts supply facilities. These units would be
assigned throughout the project so accessability of spare parts and prompt
service is essential. There is adequate domestic competition and prices are
reasonable. Standardized procedures and bidding documents developed by CWC
and approved by IDA would also be used for the equipment, materials and
supplies.
Disbursements
3.43      Disbursements would be made for:  (i) 100% of the foreign expendi-
tures for directly imported equipment; (ii) 100% for locally manufactured
goods procured ex-factory; (iii) 70% for other locally procured goods; (iv)
100% of expenditure for farming systems research, technical services, the
statewide hydrologic network and monitoring and evaluation; and (v) 60% of
expenditures for civil works. Disbursements for force account work and for
payments of less than Rs .300,000 under civil works contracts and Rs 150,000
for equipment, instruments and vehicles would be made against certificates of
expenditures, itemized by sub-project. Documentation for these works would



- 30 -
be retained by GOMP and made available for inspection by IDA during review
missions. Full documentation would be required for all other disbursements.
The estimated schedule of expenditure, the semi-annual disbursement schedule
and the proposed allocaton of the proceeds of the credit are presented in
Tables T-14 to T-16. It is expected that disbursements would be completed
by June 1987.
Accounts and Audits
3.44      The project would be subject to normal Government control and audit-
ing procedures which are satisfactory. A resident Audit Officer, representing
the State Accountant General (AG) would audit the project accounts. Although
continuous and annual audits are carried out in a timely manner, the finaliza-
tion is a lengthy process of the Statutory Audit Report presented to the
Legislature. It would be essential therefore to have interim certified state-
ments of account. Such statements certified by the AG or his designee supported
by an itemized account and a summary of the expenditures would be submitted to
IDA as soon as possible after the end of each fiscal year. Agreements have
been reached with GOMP that it would: (i) maintain separate accounts on proj-
ect expenditures (accounts would be maintained for each scheme); (ii) ensure
that these accounts would be audited annually by the AG and the resulting
interim statements of account would be submitted to IDA as soon as possible
but not later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year; (iii) make
complete accounts and financial statements available for inspection during IDA
review missions; and (iv) ensure that sufficient auditing staff would be made
available for this purpose.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
General
4.01      Implementation would be the responsibility of the following GOMP
agencies: the Irrigation Department (ID) for irrigation components down
to the 8 ha turnouts, the resettlement from reservoir areas (together with
the Rehabilitation Department), and the statewide hydrologic network; the
Agriculture Department (AD) for the sub-chak channels below the 8 ha turnouts;
the Department of Public Works (PWD) for the project roads, and the Agriculture
University for the farming systems research component. Coordination between
agencies would be by the Command Area Development Authorities (CADA).
The Irrigation Department (ID)
4.02      Existing Organization.  The ID in Madhya Pradesh is responsible
for the planning, survey, design, construction, operation and maintenance of
surface water irrigation and drainage works down to the 8 ha turnouts. The
Secretary of Irrigation is the administrative head of the ID at the State level
and is assisted by an Engineer-in-Chief (EC) and 16 Chief Engineers (CEs) who
each report directly to the Secretary of Irrigation (Organization Chart C-3).
The ID's organization is flexible and adjusted according to the work program.
At present, 16 Chief Engineers have regional and/or functional responsibili-
ties as follows:



- 31 -
(a) Four regional CEs for planning, design, construction and
O&M of all major and medium projects within their river
basin administrative areas;
(b) Six project CEs for design, construction and O&M of selec-
ted major projects (one of the four is responsible for HB
scheme and one for MRP scheme);
(c) One CE for surveys, planning and investigations of all major
projects up to the "project report" (i.e., the feasibility)
stage;
(d) Three CEs the Narmada Valley Development;
(e) One CE for groundwater and lift irrigation projects; and
(f) One CE for electrical and mechanical units and heavy
construction machinery.
4e03      Each project CE has several circles, each headed by a Superintending
Engineer (SE). A SE is responsible for three to five Divisions, each of
which is headed by Executive Engineers (EEs). A Division in turn consists of
three to five sub-divisions which are under the control of Assistant Engineers
(AEs).
4.04      Designs of most dams and major canal structures (major cross-drainage
works, etc.) are done in the offices of the project CEs, with some support
from the Central Designs Organization (CDO) of the ID. More complicated dam
designs such as the Bango Dam are done by the Central Water Commission (CWC)
of GOI. Design units in the offices of the CEs carry out general layout and
typical structure designs which are then supplied to circle and divisional
offices. The design units at the SE level and in the divisions carry out
individual structure or canal designs based on standard type designs. Although
the detailed designs of dams and major structures in the irrigation systems
are carried out in accordance with sound engineering practices, there is con-
siderable room for improvement in the design of the miinor distribution systems.
4.05      Proposed Organization for the Project.  To :implement the proposed
improvements in planning, design, construction and operation, the ID will be
strengthened. In each of the two schemes, MRP and HB, the following additional
units would be established:
(a) A new Planning and Design Unit at the SE level to work with
the General Consultants (see para 3.31) on the survey, layout
and design of the distribution system of the irrigation blocks;
(b) A Quality Control Unit headed by a SE to check the quality
of construction and to ensure that site testing of construc-
tion materials and works are systematically carried out; and



- 32 -
(c) A Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (PME) headed
by a SE to monitor project implementation, and to undertake
experimental and research programs on design standards,
work procedures, etc.. (see para 4.14).
Agreements have been reached with GOMP that it would establish by December 31,
1981 in the CE's offices of both MRP and HB schemes, the following additional
units: (i) a Planning and Design Unit; (ii) a Quality Control Unit; and (iii)
a Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, each unit with staffing patterns
acceptable to IDA.
4.06      Staffing Requirements.  The works of MRP, and HB schemes are pre-
sently being executed by two CEs, assisted by 6 SEs, 17 EEs and 64 AEs, with
supporting staff. However, the two CEs are also in charge of schemes outside
the project area. Based on the implementation schedule and workload norms
fixed by GOMP, yearwise staff requirements for the project would be:
Category   Existing    1981/82  1982/83  1983/84  1984/85  1985/86
CE           2            2         2        3         3        3
SE           7           16        16       21        21       21
EE          33           80        80      108       108      108
AE         137          312       312      452       452      452
The above table shows the substantial expansion which must take place within
the ID in order to complete the project works on time. An agreement has been
reached with GOMP that it would provide sufficient staff for the execution
of the project in accordance with the implementation schedule agreed with IDA.
The Agriculture Department (AD)
4.07      The AD would be responsible for construction of sub-chak channels
(para 3.26) under the project. The program would include construction of
channels and drains below the 8 ha turnouts and would be a continuation and
expansion of the existing pilot projects which have been carried out in
Bilaspur district. The AD would also be responsible for advising individual
farmers with respect to on-farm works, and providing extension service and
farm inputs (paras 2.28-2.36).
The Public Works Department (PWD)
4.08      The PWD would be responsible for the design, supervision and main-
tenance of the roads component. All project road works would be executed by
existing PWD Road Circles, each headed by an SE. The existing staff would be
strengthened as necessary (to be reviewed in year one of the project) with
additional staff for audit control, work planning, monitoring and training,
and maintenance. Maintenance would also be the responsibility of the PWD for
all roads constructed or improved under the project.



- 33 -
Agricultural University
4.09      The Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya (JNKVV) Agricultural
University would be responsible for the farming systems research component
(para 3.27) under the project. The program would be coordinated through the
CAD and focus on the proposed changes in cultural practices. The project will
provide timely and reliable supplies for both kharif and rabi crops and this
will call for the development of new farming systems. The research will be
done mainly by experimenting on farmers' fields in order to observe and
evaluate the acceptance of proposed improvements.
Command Area Development Authorities (CADA)
4.10      Existing Organization.  At the State level, policy decisions are
made by: (i) a Cabinet sub-committee comprised of the Chief Minister and the
Ministers of Finance, Agriculture and Revenue with the Agricultural Production
Commissioner (APC) as Secretar.y; and (ii) a state-level Coordination Committee
headed by the APC. In order to strengthen this latter Committee, GOMP created
in December 1980, a CAD cell headed by a Special Secretary Agriculture (Addi-
tional APC) with some 50% of the costs borne by GOI. This cell is in charge
of planning, monitoring and evaluating CAD programs in all major irrigation
projects in the State and has multi-disciplinary staff including Irrigation
Engineers, Agriculturalists and Economists/Statisticians.
4.11      At the project level, four CADAs have so far been established
throughout the State. Chambal and Tawa were established in 1974 and Barna-
Halali and Hasdeo-Kharung-Manyani in 1980. At present, each CADA has only a
small core staff which coordinates activities of the various GOMP departments
operating in the various irrigation command areas. Funding for the operations
are included in the specific budgets of the concerned Departments (Revenue,
Irrigation, Agriculture, Public Works, Cooperatives and Forestry). The local
heads of these departments form a CAD Management Board chaired by the Commis-
sioner of the Division. GOMP intends to set up six CADAs in major projects
which have already been largely completed.
4.12      Organization in the Project Area.  In the project area, a CADA com-
menced functioning in 1980 with headquarters at Bilaspur and is responsible
for HB scheme and the two nearby completed schemes. The Divisional Commis-
sioner is chairman of the CADA and is assisted by a full-time Project Admini-
strator with supporting staff. GOMP intends to set up a CADA for MRP scheme
area in 1981. Under the project, the CADAs would also be responsible for some
aspects of the monitoring and evaluation (paras 4.13-4.17).
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.13      A strong monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system would be essential
to ensure a reliable assessment of project progress, for undertaking studies
and investigations required for project implementation, and for assessment of
project results. Data generated through M&E activities would also be essen-
tial for the preparation of future development phases. M&E activities would
be conducted at two main levels: (i) the ID as the main implementing agency;
and (ii) the CADAs established in MRP and HB scheme areas.



- 34 -
4.14      M&E at ID Level.  The emphasis of M&E activities at ID level would
be as follows:
(a) Technical Aspects: project implementation, technical perform-
ance, design standards, specifications and cost effectiveness,
alternative canal lining techniques including lining of minors,
from the 40 ha outlet to 8 ha turnout, channel design standards
including freeboard; and labor intensive construction methods;
(b) System Water Management, from reservoir to 40 ha outlet; and
(c) Routine monitoring of operation and maintenance of the reser-
voir and irrigation systems.
Responsibility for M&E activities would be with the PME (para 4.05). To imple-
ment this program the ID would set up a Performance Monitoring and Evaluation
Unit in each project headquarters (Raipur and Bilaspur) under the CEs (para
4.04). Assistance would be obtained from Universities or other agencies
especially for the design of study programs and data analysis.
4.15      Water management studies would be undertaken in several areas (about
2,000-3,000 ha) within tRP and HB schemes such that sufficient data can be
collected to reflect typical farmer response in both kharif and rabi seasons
and be sufficient to analyze on a sound statistical basis. Subjects to be
investigated would include: (i) the economics of lining sub-minors (from the
40 ha outlet to the 8 ha turnout); (ii) organization of water distribution at
40 ha outlet level; (iii) the effects of variation in the timing and reliabi-
lity of water supply on farming practices; and (iv) factors affecting water
requirement of paddy and other project crops.
4.16      M&E at CADA Level.  Progress of project implementation would be
followed through periodical reports prepared by the departments/agencies
implementing the various project components. Monitoring and evaluation of
project benefits at farm level would be carried out by making better use of
data which is being regularly collected in on-going crop-cutting surveys; these
surveys which are conducted annually, primarily for estimating crop production
and yields, would be improved to provide the additional data required.
4.17      A monitoring and evaluation unit would be established in each CADA
(para 4.11) for these purposes. To ensure the timely analysis of the data
collected, some computerization of data processing would be necessary and has
been provided for in the cost estimates.
4.18      Use of Consultants and Universities for M&E.  Consultants would be
used to improve crop cutting surveys, for introduction of computerized data
analysis, preparation of computer programs and improvement of the reporting
system. For sophisticated multi-variate data analyses, participation of
universities and research institutions would be sought, especially the
Ravishankar University at Raipur. Provisions have been made under the project
to finance research programs conducted by senior post-graduate students and
university staff on specialized subjects which could benefit the project or
assist in preparation of future irrigation projects.



- 35 -
4.19      An agreement has been reached with GONP that it would establish by
December 31, 1981, in each CADA, a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Unit with
staffing patterns agreed by IDA.
Resettlement (SDV, Annex 8)
4.20      In the past, GOMP's procedures for resettlement from reservoirs
administered by the ID have been "ad hoc" and improvised. GOMP has recognized
that these procedures are unsatisfactory and, faced with the prospect of large
new reservoir projects, has established a clear-cut policy for the rehabilita-
tion and resettlement of persons whose lands come under submergence in irri-
gation projects. Draft legislation, which would codify the new practices, is
currently pending before the State legislature. The overriding objectives of
the new policy are: (a) to ensure fair compensation and continued livelihood
to the displaced persons; (b) to elicit in the newly settled communities a
participating response of both displaced and host populations for minimizing
hardships and rebuilding viable communities; and (c) to promote further eco-
nomic and social development in the new communities. Replacement land is
being offered on the basis of the previous holding size. Wherever required,
schools, public buildings, roads, water supply, etc., will be provided.
Transport of families to the new sites with all their household belongings
is being offered. The Government appoints District Resettlement offices to
organize this work. Rehabilitation Committees, constituted under the chair-
manship of Divisional Commissioners and comprising elected representatives
from the affected areas, advise on all resettlement matters. The Department
of Rehabilitation headed by a Secretary, has overall responsibility.
4.21      During the implementation period of the project, two reservoir areas
would come under submergence: (i) the Sondur dam, due to be completed in 1984,
would submerge about 300 ha of cultivated land, which would involve some 190
families, and (ii) the Bango dam would, starting from 1986, submerge about
5,520 ha of cultivated land presently occupied by about 1,400 families.
4.22      For the purpose of resettlement of families displaced from areas
submerged under the project, GOMP has given assurances that it would: (i)
not less than two years before causing submergence of any land covered by the
project, formulate a resettlement plan, including an implementation schedule
agreed with the IDA; and (ii) as part of this resettlement plan, ensure that
displaced families are offered land suitable for cultivation. Families, whose
land had been under irrigation, will be given preference in the allocation
of irrigated land in the new areas.
Operation and Maintenance of the Irrigation Systems
4.23      In the kharif season, supplementary irrigation would be provided
to make up water shortages. Each distributary will be operated as a unit and
allowance made for localized rainfall variations. At peak demand periods, all
canals would run at full design discharge; at other times, main and branch
canals would be operated on a varying discharge basis with distributary systems
rotated to reflect the local area demand. Below the 40 ha outlet, the entire
flow would be supplied to each 8 ha turnout in turn on a time rotation basis



36 -
with time of flow proportional to the cultivable command area of the turnout.
The turn would define the water right of the farmers within the 8 ha unit
with respect to quantity and time of their collective turn in the rotational
cycle. Distribution below the 8 ha unit for the kharif crop would follow
the present field-to-field practice of irrigating rice except in the areas
benefiting from sub-chak channels (para 3.26).
4.24      At present, there is very limited rabi irrigation (only in the MRP
command area) and this tends to be concentrated near the head of the irrigation
system. Under the schemes, both MRP and HB commands would provide rabi irri-
gation and some perennial water supplies would be available in the HB command
area. Each year, the rabi irrigated area will vary depending on water retained
in storage from the previous monsoon, after demands for industrial and domestic
use and the carryover storage required to start the kharif rice in the follow-
ing year have been allocated from the available supply. Each farmer would be
notified of his water allocation early enough to plan for the rabi crop and
told when the supply would be made available to him. The allocation would
be based on: (i) availability of water at the end of the monsoon season;
(ii) crop water requirements for the distributary under which the farmer is
located; (iii) the size of his holdings; and (iv) the soil conditions.
4.25      At present, there are no completed works in MP designed to the
project standards which are operational. Consequently, GOMP has not finalized
requirements of staffing, equipment and facilities to ensure efficient opera-
tion and preventative maintenance of the project works. However, the project
does provide for those equipment and facilities (see para 3.30) which need
to be supplied during the time slice; it also provides for a comprehensive
management study once sufficient works are completed for project O&M require-
ments to be finalized (see Annex 2). Agreements have been reached with GOMP
that it would: (i) undertake a detailed management study to establish rules,
procedures and requirements for the effective operation and preventative
maintenance of the project schemes; and (ii) prepare the terms of reference
of such a study by March 31, 1983 to be reviewed by IDA. In addition, an
agreement has been reached with GOMP that it would promptly inform IDA of the
annual financial and other allocations made for the operation and maintenance,
separately for each of the MRP and HB schemes.
V. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND COST RECOVERY
General
5.01      The project would support a five-year time-slice of an on-going
development program that would command about 595,000 ha I/ at full development.
The "present" and "future with project" situations in terms of average annual
irrigated areas for MRP and HB schemes can be summarized as follows:
1/   Additional 34,000 ha in Pairi Command (MRP scheme) constitutes a self-
contained irrigation area. Rehabilitation of the area would commence
in about 1991.

/a   Including Pairi Irrigation Project.
The project would substantially increase agricultural production through
increased irrigated area and crop yields, resulting in higher and more regular
rural incomes and employment opportunities. Investments financed under the
project would also provide for industrial water supplies for the thermal power
stations and other industrial users at Korba, for a steel plant at Bhilai
and for municipal water requirements of Raipur and Bhilai towns.
Agricultural Production
5.02      The present and projected future cropping patterns for MRP and HB
schemes are given in Table T-17. Present agricultural practices are reviewed
in paras 2.21 to 2.24 and reflect uncertain rainfall and unreliable irriga-
tion water supply. Average paddy yields at present are low (about 1.4 tons/ha)
and cultivation is virtually limited to the kharif season. The climatic risk
factor is the principal constraint in farmers' use of modern high yielding
varieties which require relatively costly inputs of labor, seed, fertilizer
and chemicals. The project would result in substantial changes of the present
production techniques especially in the kharif season. The main transforma-
tion would be from the traditional broadcast method of planting kharif paddy
(biasi), to the transplanting of short duration (120-135 days) HYV paddy.
5.03      In the MRP scheme area the extent of rabi cultivation would depend
on water stored in the reservoirs by the end of the monsoon season which will
vary with the amount and distribution of rainfall from year to year. The
percentage of rabi irrigation will therefore vary from nil to about 33% in
the low monsoon years to exceed 60% in good monsoon years and should average
about 35%. The amount of water available for rabi cultivation can be made
known to farmers only at the end of the kharif season. The uncertainty
regarding the scope of rabi cultivation would be minimized through careful
water storage management and good agricultural extension service. Rabi
cropping patterns most suitable under such conditions would be developed
through the farming systems research activities (para 3.27) and should result
in development of optimal rabi cropping patterns before water for sizable rabi
irrigated areas becomes available in the 1990s.
5.04      In the HB scheme, more storage would be available per ha of area
commanded and the average rainfall is slightly higher than in the MRP area.
Consequently, a higher percentage of early transplanted paddy would be pos-
sible and the area for rabi cropping would be higher than in MRP. Perennial
crops (sugarcane and bananas) can also be grown reusing water supplies which
are primarily used for cooling thermal power stations and given on a priority



- 38 -
basis to industrial users. Water would also be available for some hot weather
crops (groundnut, maize and summer mung).
5.05      Expected Future Development Without Project.  The existing irrigated
area in MRP scheme averages about 224,000 ha per annum. Completion of Dudhawa
reservoir (first filled to full capacity in 1978) and Ravishankar (1979)
reservoir have not yet been fully reflected in present crop production. For
the purposes of project analysis, it has been assumed that with an adequate
level of irrigation system management about 70,000 ha of the present irrigated
area can be transformed to the "future" cropping pattern in the kharif season.
The capacity of the existing main and branch canals and the amount of water
available would compensate for existing system inefficiencies and enable such
cropping transitions to take place. In addition, it has been assumed that
about 24,000 ha of the existing area can be put to the "future" rabi cropping
pattern (Table T-17) using surplus storage water immediately available to the
MRP scheme area. In the case of HB scheme, it has been assumed that neither
the cropping patterns nor crop yields would change from the present situation
until Bango Dam is substantially complete (1986) because without storage, the
transition to early transplanted kharif paddy cannot take place and water
would not be available for rabi or perennial crops. Allowance has also been
made for existing rainfed areas which are cultivated and will be lost under
the project through submergence in reservoir areas or as land required to
construct new irrigation works. The assumptions regarding the agricultural
transition from the present to "future with project" situation are given in
Annex 3.
5.06      The expected average annual increase in agricultural production
resulting from works under the time-slice forming this project and for the
whole project at full development are detailed in Table T-18 and summarized
below. It has been assumed that in each irrigation block developed under the
project, full crop production level would be reached 5-7 years after commence-
ment of water delivery.

Market Prospects and Prices
5.07      As indicated, paddy is the principal crop in the project area.
Because the area is already a major exporter of rice, most of the incremental



- 39 -
production is likely to be be exported. The quality of the rice produced in
the region is high making it suitable for export abroad. According to Bank
projections, India will quite possibly be a net exporter of foodgrains in the
near future. 1/ The project area could therefore become a major exporter of
rice to foreign markets. In the State and the project area, there is an ade-
quate system for marketing, storage and processing of agricultural produce
with a capacity which exceeds present requirements (see para 2.32) which
should be able to absorb without difficulties the increases in production
expected to accrue over a 15 year development period. To facilitate a quick
transition to export oriented production of rice when the need arises, the
project would finance a study of the steps required within MP to achieve such
a change. The study would examine topics such as testing of export varieties,
processing and marketing. The study would be conducted by a University or
research institution using funds provided under the M&E component. 2/
5.08      Paddy Prices.  The level of producer paddy prices could effect pro-
duction level and the rate of transition to improved farming techniques. The
projections made for this project indicate a considerable gap between the
(higher) prices which could be realized through exportation of rice and the
domestic price level (Table T-19).  Although the level of domestic prices
would be sufficient to induce farmers to adopt the improved agricultural
technology required to achieve the production and productivity levels assumed
under the project, it is clear that higher prices for exportable rice if
passed on to the farmers could accelerate such transition. On the other hand,
higher prices of rice would effect consumers and slow the process of agricul-
tural diversification. It would be desirable, therefore, to reassess the
pricing policy for paddy if export of rice from the project becomes signifi-
cant.
Farm Incomes
5.09      The poor distribution and high variability of rainfall and the
unreliable water supply in the irrigated areas are the major constraints to
agricultural production. The general pattern observed is that large farmers
normally occupy the head reaches of the distribution system, while the pro-
portion of small and poor farmers increases towards the tail ends where water
supply becomes limited and is more unreliable. Provision of timely, reliable
and equitable supplementary irrigation during the kharif season and making
water available for the rabi and hot weather seasons will have significant
income distribution effects (see para 2.14).
5.10      The effect of project activities on farm incomes was estimated
through an analysis of farm budgets for typical 2.0 ha farm units for the MRP
1/   Economic Situation and Prospects of India, Report No. 3401-IN, April 15,
1981.
2/   It would be desirable to also have a country-level study of the problems
associated with export of rice such as: (i) the variability of world
prices; (ii) the thin international market for rice; and (iii) the fact
that some Indian varieties may not be easily marketed internationally.

existing reservoir storage works (see para 5.05).
The increase in net farm incomes for MRP and HB schemes would range from
125% to 310% and average about 206%. In addition to these direct effects,
the project would generate indirect benefits through a series of multiplier
employment and income effects that would not be confined only to the project
area. These, however, are difficult to estimate and were not included in this
analysis.
Impact on Rural Poverty
5.11      The project would significantly reduce the incidence of poverty in
the command areas. This is demonstrated in the following table which compares
the percentage of farm families with incomes below the poverty line with and
without the project. The estimates have been derived using the distribution
of farm sizes and estimates or net farm income per ha and can be summarized as
follows:

/a   The estimated absolute poverty line is Rs 780 per annum (in
1981 prices).



- 41 -
This analysis indicates that the anticipated increase in return per irrigated
ha at full development stage would raise net income of most farm families
above the poverty line.
5.12      Income levels of landless laborers in the scheme areas are generally
lower than incomes of small farmers. The effects of the project on incomes of
rural landless are difficult to forecast but would be substantial, particularly
as the demand for farm labor increases. Experience in similar projects indi-
cates that the number of employment days of an average landless worker would
increase by more than 50% as a result of the intensifications of agricultural
production which accompanies the introduction of reliable irrigation services.
The income of hired laborers would also increase as a result of higher wages
paid in irrigated farming which are about 25% higher than those paid for
rainfed farming operations (presently about Rs 4.30 per day compared with
Rs 3.40 per day).
Cost Recovery
5.13      Water and Water-Related Charges.  Current water rates vary from
Rs 25/ha for kharif foodgrain (other than paddy) to Rs 100/ha for sugarcane
and perennial tree crops and are Rs 60/ha for paddy (Table T-24). For the
present cropping pattern in MRP and HB schemes, the annual water charge would
averages about Rs 45/ha of net CCA. In addition, a cess of Rs 12/ha is levied
on the total CCA and a tax is levied on land under commercial crops at Rs 10/ha
for sugarcane and tobacco and Rs 5/ha for cotton and groundnut. The Irrigation
Act 1/ provides for collection of a betterment levy from farmers benefitting
from irrigation, amounting to 3% per annum of development cost per ha in the
first five years and 4.5% in the next ten years. However, there have been
legal complications in its enforcement and GOMP is not collecting the levy.
Water for industrial and domestic purposes is charged on a volumetric basis
(Table T-24).
5.14      Other Agricultural Taxes. 2/  Since incomes in the agricultural sec-
tor are much lower than in the manufacturing and service sectors, the annual
rate of agricultural taxation (mainly land revenue) is relatively modest
amounting to about Rs 15-20 per ha. More important, from a revenue point of
view, is the agricultural sales tax which is levied on agricultural produce at
the following rates:
Crop                   Rate
Foodgrains                3%
Pulses                    5%

5.15      Present Level of Cost Recovery.  Water rates for surface irrigation
are uniform throi7hout the State. Although low compared with other States,
the direct charges (water rate, cess and land revenue) as a percentage of the
incremental net income, averages 54% for MRP scheme and 34% for HB scheme.
On a percentage basis, the average rent realized under the present level of
irrigation services in the project area amount to 45% for MRP scheme and 23%
for HB scheme (Table T-25). As in most other irrigation projects in India,
irrigation benefits in the project area are negatively correlated with the
distance from the head reach. 1/ The incremental net income and rent from
irrigation accrued to "tail enders" who usually belong to the poorest segments
of the farming population is much lower than the average and the present
charges already impose a heavy burden on them. Largely as a result of the
poor irrigation service, the recovery rate of water charges in the State is
low and during the last 5 years ranged from 23% to 59% with about 25% of the
arrears collected each year. GOMP plans to increase the water rates consider-
ably. However, it would be difficult to make farmers pay higher charges before
irrigation benefits increase considerably and their distribution becomes more
reliable and equitable.
5.16      The Potential for Increased Recovery.  It is anticipated that at
full development stage, the average net income per irrigated ha of (AA will
increase from the present level of Rs 1,140 to Rs 4,770 and the average rent
per ha of CCA will increase from Rs 120 to Rs 2,540. Additionally, the improved
design standards will result in a more reliable and equitable water supply and
therefore reduce the differences in net returns between "head" and "tail"
fields. Consequently there will be a considerable potential for increasing
irrigation charges. However, because at present the water rates are uniform
throughout the State irrespective of irrigation service provided (para 5.13),
their current level must be within the repayment capability of those farmers
realizing the lowest irrigation benefits (mostly tail enders in traditionally
designed projects). It is therefore unlikely that GOMP would be able to
realize the increased potential for revenue from higher water rates in the
more modern irrigation projects unless the principle of "Statewide uniform
rates" is amended, This could be done by introducing a charge system consist-
ing of two or more tiers with higher water rates in projects like MP Medium,
MP Major and any future irrigaticn projects designed to similar standards.
There are precedents to such a tier system in India. A "two tier" charge
system for irrigation already exists in many Indian States where the water
rates for irrigation from public tubewells are considerably higher than those
for gravity canal irrigation projects; the higher rates recognize the larger
investment and operational costs of supplying water from public tubewells.
5.17      Timing Considerations.  The optimal timing for raising water charges
has to be carefully assessed. A premature increase (i.e. before most of the
farmers realize the incremental benefits) might be undesirable for several
1/   Results from the "outlet studies" indicate that the yield of kharif paddy
in fields located at "tail-end" as a percentage of the yield obtained at
"head reach" could be as low as 8% in an extreme drought year (1979) and
42% in a year with good rainfall (1980).



- 43 -
reasons: (i) it may discourage farmers, especially tail-enders from using
water, thus reducing irrigation benefits from the society viewpoint and further
aggravating income inequities; (ii) it may be offset by lower recovery per-
centages and high administrative costs; and (iii) large increases in irrigation
charges during project implementation might reduce farmers' cooperation and
delay the attainment of full development stage (para 6.07 (a)). On the other
hand, the negative aspects of "late" increase would be relatively small:
(i) the effect on government finance would be small since revenue from irriga-
tion charges in MP accounts for only about 1% of the total State revenue; and
(ii) farmers would most likely use a considerable part of the "recoverable"
rent to increase investment in other agricultural inputs generating a rate of
return not lower than that realized through government financed investments.
It would be difficult to raise the water rates exactly on time concurrently
with completed development programs and it is likely that any change in water
charges will take place either "too early" or "late" for most of the benefi-
ciaries. It appears from the above that the cost to the society of a "too
early" increase would considerably exceed the cost of a "late" one. It is
also unlikely that it would be feasible to introduce a differential charge
system (para 5.16) before sizable areas throughout the State, designed to
improved irrigation standards, are commissioned, successfully operated and
irrigated areas are realizing potential project benefits. The completed areas
throughout the State would have to be substantial enough to warrant the legal
and institutional changes required to set up the new charge system.
5.18      Conclusions.  The discussion above leads to the conclusion that the
appropriate time to initiate substantial changes in the water charge system
would be several years after the start of the MP Major project. Until then
the level of charges can be expected to remain unchanged in real terms. As
the method of water allocation and charge would have a considerable effect
on the economic efficiency of water use at farm level, the implication of
alternative methods should be carefully assessed before changes can be
recommended.
5.19      Consequently, a large number of studies and investigations would
be required before proposals for improvements to the present charge system
can be prepared. These would include studies of legal aspects of various
methods of recovery (e.g. betterment levy) and factors effecting recovery
of irrigation charges and estimates of the incremental net income and rent
accruing to farmers in modern irrigation projects. Such studies should be
conducted throughout the State over a number of years.
5.20      Under the Madhya Pradesh Medium Irrigation Project (Cr. 1108-IN),
GOMP has undertaken to review the water and water-related charges in the
State. Guidelines for such a review and for long term studies and investi-
gations of water and water related charges are given in Annex 12, SDV,
Appendix 2. Agreements have been reached with GOMP that on the basis of
these studies it would : (i) review the water and water-related charges in
the State by December 31, 1983; and (ii) after paying due regard to IDA's
comments, and as soon as possible, implement a system of charges that would
ensure recovery of annual O&M costs and, to the extent possible, cost of
infrastructure investments. In establishing the level of charges, due con-
sideration would be given to the incentives and payment capacity of farmers.

j.21      Cost and Rent Recovery Under the Project.  The assumptions made for
estimating cost and rent recovery are given in Annex 3. Under these assump-
tions the rent recovery indexes would amount to 30% and 34% for MRP and RB
schemes, respectively. Full recovery of the resources invested in the project
over a period of 50 years at 12% per annum would require an average annual
recovery of about Rs 700 per ha of CCA. The average annual recovery through
water related charges and agricultural taxes is estimated at Rs 230 per ha
cf CCA. The Cost Recovery Index (average for MRP and RB schemes) would
i,erefor. amount to about 33% 'Table T-26).
5.22      The estimates of cost and rent recovery do not take into account
the incremental government revenue from other indirect taxes resulting from
the incremental value added which is generated by the project 1/ and from
the export of rice. The latter category is important because most of the
incremental rice production would be directly or indirectly exported. The
difference between the average financial price paid to producers and finan-
cial price which would be realized through export (Table T-19) is estimated at
about Rs 650/ton of paddy or about Rs 900/ha (average for tIRP and HB schemes)
at full development. If present export arrangements remain unchanged such
surplus would largely remain with the exporting agencies (GOI through the Food
Corporation of India and GOMP). It could be regarded as a "quasi" export tax
and if added to the cost recovery calculations would raise the Cost Recovery
Index to about 70% (average for the MRP and HB schemes).
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIF'ICATION
Project Impact
6.01      The overall direct project impact 2/ in terms of agricultural
production, rural employment generated and of farm families benefitting
at full development is summarized below:
1/   It should be noted that this represents only part of GOI's and GOMP's
incremental revenue resulting from the operation. The reason is that
increased agricultural incomes would generate growth in the non-
agricultural sectors of the State's economy and the implicit taxation
on these sectors are significantly higher than on agriculture. Thus,
the total cost recovery from the direct and indirect benefits of the
operation would be considerably higher.
2/   Estimates of project impact (including employment) are for the whole
project at the full development stage. The percentage of these resulting
from the time-slice financed under the project only is estimated at about
25% of full project impact.

/a   Defined as the sum of gross farm incomes minus cash inputs (excluding
labor).
Employment Effects
6.02      A considerable increase in employment would be generated by project
construction works and by increase in agricultural production. It is estimated
that the number of unskilled labor employed daily in construction work over the
next 15-20 years would amount to 120,000 full time jobs. The provision of new
irrigation areas and the improvement of existing sy.stems would increase direct
employment considerably. At full development stage, the increased demand for
labor for agricultural production resulting from the project would amount to
about 50 M mandays per annum (equivalent to about 208,000 full time jobs). It
is estimated that about two thirds of the demand would be supplied by hired
labor, the majority of which consists of landless workers (para 5.12). The
projected increase in value added in agriculture would be some Rs 1,500 M. The
development would also generate additional income and employment in local non-
farming sectors such as marketing, transport and processing estimated at about
47,000 full-time jobs. Thus, the operation would substantially decrease the
high level of unemployment and underemployment in the scheme areas.
Economic Analysis
6.03    - Basic Assumptions.  The assumptions for the analysis are detailed in
Annex 3. The economic prices of major agricultural outputs (Table T-19) were
derived from projected 1990 world market prices expressed in 1981 currency
values. Bank projections (para 5.07) indicate that India may well become a
net exporter of foodgrains in the near future. Consequently, estimates of
the economic price of paddy are based on the assumption that the incremental
production of that crop would be directly or indirectly exported out of India.



- 46 -
If India continues to be a net importer of rice, the economic price of paddy
would be about 4% higher than the price assumed in the project analysis.
Agricultural wages were based on the weighted average of seasonal wage rates
for irrigated and rainfed areas. Assessment of future yields for the "with"
as well as the "without" project situation, was based on surveys in project
areas, on yield statistics and on direct information in the field. The cost
and benefit streams for MRP and RB schemes (Table T-27, and T-28, respectively)
have been adjusted by appropriate conversion factors to bring them to a
comparable world market price basis.
6.04      Economic Rate of Return (ERR).  The ERR was calculated for the full
development stage of both schemes and not for the time-slice financed under
the project since works financed under this timeslice are closely related
to those which would be financed under follow-up phases. Implementation
schedules and costs and benefits to full development were based on careful
assessment of GOMP's implementation capability. Sunk costs were accounted
for in the analysis. Discounting cost and benefit streams over 50 years, the
ERR is estimated at 20% for MRP scheme, 22% for HB scheme and 21% (weighted
average) for the two schemes combined.
6.05      Economics of Canal Lining.  Lining of the distribution system down
to the 40 ha outlet level is an essential component of this project. GOMP
is committed to spreading the irrigation benefits over a large area and its
decision to line was made after examination of several design alternatives
which were analyzed by WAPCOS. This analysis has shown that the cost per
ha of CCA of expanding irrigation services through lining would be lower than
providing irrigation from other sources. The ERR of lining in the MRP and HB
scheme areas ranged from 19% to 36%. The incremental benefits were largely
based on those generated by the reduction of seepage losses. However, there
will be substantial other benefits from lining which cannot be adequately
quantified. These include: (i) the greater flexibility of operating a lined
system particularly in view of the need to serve small and varying crop areas
in the rabi season and to provide water for early kharif nurseries; (ii) the
greater reliability of water supply; (iii) the possibility to spread irriga-
tion benefits equitably and over a large area; and (iv) the relative cost
advantage of reduction in channel cross section when a canal is lined.
Detailed analysis is given in SDV, Annex 9.
6.06      Sensitivity Analysis.  Sensitivity analysis was conducted to deter-
mine the effect of deviations from the main assumptions on the economic
viability of the project. The measure of sensitivity used, the 'switching
value' is the value of the variable tested which would reduce the present
value of the project's net incremental benefits discounted at 12% (the esti-
mated opportunity cost of capital) to zero. The results are summarized in
the following table:

Changes in other parameters, such as particular values of conversion factors,
economic wages, and O&M cost, had no significant effect on the ERR.
Project Risk
6.07      The results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that only large
deviations from the basic project assumptions would make it economically
unviable. However, the net benefits and/or the equity of their distribution
could be affected in the following events:
(a)  Farmers may be slower than anticipated in providing per-
mission to construct sub-minors along field boundaries.
However, experience with construction of sub-minors for
the outlet studies shows that the response of most of the
farmers should be positive. In order to minimize potential
difficulties, the project would start construction of
sub-minors in those areas where farmers favor such works.
These areas would then demonstrate the considerable benefits
accruing to farmers and facilitate cooperation with the
project.



- 48 -
(b)  GOAP could give-in :o pressure by influenf al farmers and
permit the growing of summer paddy, 1/ which consumes large
quantities of water and generates low benefits per unit of
water. This could: (i) slow down the implementation pro-
gram; (ii) create inequities in the distribution of rabi
irrigation and considerably reduce rabi benefits; (iii)
create pressure to reduce the storage of water for early
kharif irrigation; and (iv) intensify the incidence of pests.
ROMP is aware of the need to con4 rol summer paddy cultt atiop.
Agreements have been reached with GOMP that it would: (i)
not change the implementation schedule in order to provide
canal irrigation for summer paddy during the construction
period; and (ii) award the lowest priority to allocation of
irrigation water for summer crops.
(c) GOMP could have difficulties in recruitment of the staff
required for implementing the project. These would be con-
siderably reduced as a result of GOMP decision to involve
the private sector in design work and to retain General
Consultants.
Although the risk of GOMP not proceeding with project works after completion
of this time slice was considered in the sensitivity analysis (Annex 3), it
is regarded minimal for the following reasons: (i) GOMP is fully committed
to development of the project area; (ii) with the works completed under the
project becoming 'sunk cost', the economic viability of the remaining works
will be high; and (iii) GOMP has agreed at negotiations that "the MRP and HB
schemes shall be completed as soon as technically feasible after the Credit
has been fully disbursed". It is therefore expected that if future financial
constraints should arise and result in a reduction in the State's overall
irrigation development program, GOMP will give a clear priority to the imple-
mentation of follow-up phases of this project until its completion. Thus,
the project risks do not exceed those associated with irrigation projects of
similar size in India.
Environmental Effects
6.08      The main water-related diseases in Madhya Pradesh are malaria and
typhoid. The construction of drainage facilities and the lining of canals in
the project would tend to reduce areas of stagnating water which are suitable
breeding ground for mosquitoes. Thus, the project would have no adverse
environmental effects.
VII. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      An agreement has been reached with GOI that:
(a) it would make the proceeds of the credit available to GOMP

M & I - Municipal and Iodustrial Users.
f/ The water balances and reservoir operation illustrates what would have happened In the direct cojasand area of Mahanadi Main Canal (319,000 ha) during the
period 1949 to 1975 if MRP scheme had been fully developed in 1949 thus enabling a historical record of river inflows and rainfall to be used.
2/ Ravishankar and Dudhawa are operated as one reservoir; Murumailli Reservoir is held in reserve to meet Municipal and Industrial (M&I) shortages.
3/ Based on 60 cumec capacity.
4/ The MU1 demand is the coamitment made by the ID to M&I users; irrigation demand represeeots an system water requirements estimated from the full development
cropping patterns; crop water requirements and system losses as detailed in Annex 7.
5/ These shortages can be met in most years by drawing on Hurumsilli Reservoir. There is some oversatement of shortages as the 376.6 Mm3 assumes an
upstream depletion of 70.6 Mm3 which would be less in shortage years.
6/  muramsilli Reservoir can be used in most years to reduce shortages in June and July because of inadequate water in carry over storage  usually following
a heavy kharif shortage year or from a delay in the onset of the monsoon. The July shortages can also be eliminated or at least significantly reduced by
delaying the first irrigation beyond July I or by stretching out the transplanting and 'biasi' operations  on into August.  Shortages alao occur in some
years from planting too much rabi.

It   The water balances and reservoir operation illustrates what would have happened during the period 1949 to 1975 if HB scheme had been fully developed in 1949
thus enablintg a historical record of river inflows and rainfall to be used.
21 Stream floyw measured at Naedeo Barrage.
3/   The 14&  demand is the commaitment mady by the IDI to 6141 users; irrigation demand represents on system vater requirements estimated from the foil development
cropping patterns; crop water requirements and system losses as detailed in Annex 7.
4/   The Municipal and Industrial (M&I) water shortages vould he offset by curtailing kharif irrigation or by requiring some recycling or other economoics in water
uae.  The year 1966 is the only critical period and this occurs because 1965 is an extremely low runoff year.  The year 1968 had less runoff than 1965 but
the occurrence -f two extremely dry years back-to-back is more isevere and is normally uneconomical to design to.

2/ Assumed family equivalent of five and a half persons.
3/ Risk Equivalent - Expected gross value of production x famers' risk aversion factor x
coefficient of variation of yields. The risk aversion factor is assumed as 2.0. in the
situation without project and 1.5 in the situation with project. The coefficient of ield
variation has been assumed as 20% in presently rainfed areas and 15% in presently Irrigated
areas in the without project situation and a uniform rate of 10% has been assumed in the with
project situation.
4/ The reward for management and entrepreneurship is primarily a premium for the special skills
that farm management requires. Consequently, it has been assumed that the "management fee"
is equal to 10Z of the net returns.
5/ Project rent relates to the incremental land developed under the project that can achieve full project benefits.
6/ At present the implicit land rent in irrigated areas is about Rs/ha 180 and about Rs/ha 60 in rainfed areas, i.e.
- the rent due to irrigation is Rs/ha 120.

MADHYA PRADESH MAJOR IRRIGATION PROJECT
Terms of Reference for Locally Recruited Consultants
Background
1.        The original project proposals were prepared by the Irrigation
Department (ID) in the early 1970s. They followed the traditional planning
and design concepts of the period in India after independence. In particular,
crop water requirements were underestimated, and project agricultural objec-
tives needed to be clarified in more detail. GOMP in 1978 retained WAPCOS 1/
to produce a Feasibility Report (FR) which was completed in August 1980. The
report incorporated many new ideas and concepts for the planning, design and
management of the proposed irrigation systems which are novel in MP and now
need to be translated into practice. In addition, the ID will require a
substantial increase in implementation capacity at all staff levels both for
planning, design and construction if the proposed implementation programs are
to be achieved.
2.        Under the circumstances, GOMP has agreed that advisory services
of outside Consultant firms would be sought with respect to the following:
(a) General Consultants to advise the ID in translating the
concepts of the WAPCOS Feasibility Report into detailed
planning and design procedures, in testing alternative design
solutions, and establishing least cost solutions for meeting
the performance criteria established for the system layouts.
The ID also requires. advice on improved operation and main-
tenance procedures so that the irrigation systems can be
managed efficiently; and
(b)  Engineering Consultants to carry out the detailed survey and
design of the irrigation systems below the distributary head
regulators down to the 8 ha turnouts.
General Consultants
3.        GOMP would retain the services of a public or private sector consul-
tant firm experienced in planning, design and implementation of modern irriga-
tion schemes. In addition to technical expertise, the Consultants would need
to be familiar with practices and procedures of State Irrigation Departments
and with a number of IDA-assisted projects in India. The consultants would:

Conditions of Employment
4.        The General Consultants would be responsible to the Engineer-in-
Chief through the CEs directly responsible for the project works and would
function only in an advisory role. The consultants would establish a project
office in Raipur with adequate technical staff supported by Senior Staff from
their Head Office. The initial agreement would be for three years subject to
satisfactory performance; this would be extended by mutual agreement until
GOMP professional staff with the requisite experience can continue the program
without further assistance. Charges for technical assistance would be 100%
reimbursable under the project together with any costs for facilities and
service required by the Consultants so that they can function effectively.
5.        The Advisory Unit would consist of three Senior Engineers exper-
ienced in lined irrigation system planning and implementation and an irriga-
tion system management expert. GOMP would provide the services of a Senior
Agriculturalist and a Senior Project Economist to work with the proposed
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit. In addition, experts in groundwater, irriga-
tion law, irrigated agriculture and hydrology would be provided by the Consul-
tants on short term basis as required. By December 31, 1982, the ID assisted
by the Consultants, will produce a comprehensive implementation manual (to be
reviewed by IDA) which updates or replaces present statewide technical cri-
teria to be used for works in the project area. The report would also iden-
tify areas which might make the project more cost effective or efficient. The
report would be printed in sufficient copies so that all technical staff could
be provided with a copy.
6.        The ID would provide sufficient transportation equipment and faci-
lities for the General Consultants to function efficiently and such provisions
would revert to the ID at the termination of the consultancy. The ID would
also provide necessary support staff to assist the General Consultants to
fulfill their obligations. The provisional cost estimates of the General
Consultancy are given in Annex 4A, Table 7.
Engineering Consultants
7.        The ID would retain the services of outside public or private firms
of Engineering Consultants for the survey, planning, and design of the canal
distribution systems and minor drainage systems serving the areas to be
"block developed" under the project (about 154,000 ha) in the command areas
of MRP and HB schemes. The works would be let as contracts covering an
irrigation block (or number of blocks) serving about 5,000 ha. Contracts
would be let through GOMP's LCB procedures and restricted to engineering firms
which have been prequalified by IDA in terms of experience and qualifications.
The general terms of reference would include:
(a) production of 1:4,000/1:2,000 scale maps with (a) spot levels
and (b) contours suitable for use as a basis for canal system

ways, and any other features relevant to the project works.
One set of maps would show at least one spot level in each
rice paddy; a second set of maps would show general contours
to 30 cms interval to represent the natural ground profile
before the rice field terracing and the cadestral informa-
tion avaiiable frola village ma, s;
(b) preparation of preliminary irrigation system layouts from
distributary head regulators down to 40 ha outlets together
with the alignments of sub-minor channels down to 8 ha turnout
and alignment of minor drainage. These layouts would comply
with the general design principles, assumptions and criteria
outlined in SDV, Annex 9 and detailed in the Feasibility
Reports of MP Major Irrigation Project 1/ as amended from
time to time by the ID. In particular, the boundaries of
the 40 ha outlet command and the sub-chak commands (about 8
ha) would be selected to comply with the minor canalization
design principles outlined in Appendix 2 of SDV, Annex 9.
The preliminary layouts would be the least cost solution
able to fulfill the technical and operational objectives of
the project irrigation schemes;

Assumptions for Economic Analysis
Prices
1.        General.  The economic prices of major traded agricultural outputs
were derived from the IBRD projected 1990 world market prices expressed in
1981 currency value with appropriate adjustments for freight, handlIng and
processing. The projected economic prices for non-traded foodgrains are
derived by applying a foodgrain conversion factor (FCF) to the financial
price (para 4). Non-traded goods and services were brought to a common basis
with the traded ones through the use of conversion factors (explained in the
following paras). A standard exchange rate of US$1 to Rs 8.00 was used to
convert prices expressed in US dollars to local currency values. The assump-
tions behind the estimates are described below.
2.        Standard Conversion Factor (SCF).  The costs and benefits of the
project are evaluated at world market prices, in order to measure correctly
what India's net economic benefits from the project. However, many of the
costs are for items that are not traded on the world market. Tariffs and
trade restrictions introduce a distortion in the price relationship between
traded goods--valued at world markets--and non-traded goods--valued at local
prices. In order to make them comparable, an SCF is applied to the price of
non-traded goods. In the absence of trade restrictions, the SCF can be
approximately calculated using the formula:
SCF  =          + M
X +S  + M + T
x        m
where  X  = export value (f.o.b.);
M = import value (c.i.f.);
Sx = subsidies on exports;
T = taxes and duties on imports.
m
For the period since 1970, this calculation gives a SCF of 0.86. However,
since this estimate does not take into consideration quantitative restric-
tions on trade, it provides only an upper limit for the SCF. The Indian
Planning Commission recommends for the evaluation of industrial projects,
the use of conversion factors for foreign exchange and for untraded goods
that implicitly give a SCF of aout 0.75. Because of the approximate nature
of this estimate, a SCF of 0.8 has been used in the economic analysis.
Specific conversion factors were calculated for construction costs and non-
traded foodgrains (see below).



-94-
ANNEX 3
Page 2
3.        Construction Conversion Factor (CCF).  The schemes would be con-
structed using a mixture of equipment, skilled and unskilled labor. For the
economic analysis, the CCF was estimated as follows:
(a)  Traded Component:  This component includes capital-intensive
works which require imported materials. Hence the conversion
factor is 1.00 and it is estimated that about 21% of the con-
struction costs fall under this category.
(b)  Non-Traded Component:  This component includes work that
require skilled labor and locally manufactured materials.
The SCF of 0.80 is used as the conversion factor for these
works. About 45% of the construction costs are included
in this category.
(c)  Unskilled Labor:  A ratio of economic to financial wages
similar to the one assumed for agricultural labor (67%) has
been assumed for unskilled construction labor. It is esti-
mated that unskilled labor constitutes about 34% of the
construction costs.
Conversion Factor      Weight
Traded Items                       1.00              0.21
Non-traded Items                   0.80              0.45

4.        Foodgrains Conversion Factor (FCF).  The economic prices for trpied
goods such as rice, wheat, cotton, groundnuts, and sugarcane were based on
their border prices at the standard exchange rate. The domestic cost compo-
nents (i.e., local transport and marketing charges) were adjusted by the SOF
of 0.80. The economic prices for non-traded foodgrains (maize and pulses were
assumed to be non-traded) were derived by applying the FCF to their projected
financial prices. The FCF was estimated using the following formula:
FCF       (Q rice x PE rice) + (Q wheat x PE wheat) = 1.215
(Q rice x PF rice) + (Q wheat x PF wheat)
where:  Q:   Madhya Pradesh Production
PE:   Economic Price
PF:   Financial Price
The projected financial prices for various crops are based on the estimated
historical price trends 1/ in Madhya Pradesh.

S.        The Price of Paddy.  Paddy is the principal crop in the project area.
Its economic price has considerable effect on project benefits and has been
thoroughly investigated. Because the project area is already a major exporter
of rice, it has been assumed that the incremental production would be exported.
Bank projections indicate that in the 1990s India is likely to be a net
exporter of foodgrains. 1/ Consequently, the economic price of paddy is based
on the assumptions that incremental rice production would be exported out of
India. However, the exportable surplus would be a small proportion of the
total production, may not materialize in drought years, and would depend on
India achieving the assumed rate of agricultural growth. If the incremental
production would not be exported outside India (directly or indirectly) the
economic price would be about 4% higher. The effect on the ERR is discussed
in para 18. Detailed calculations are given in Table 1.
Prices of Agricultural Inputs
6.        Fertilizers have been valued at the projected world market price.
Pesticides and insecticides have been assumed to be traded; to make allow-
ance for taxes and subsidies and the total cost of transport and marketing,
a conversion factor of 0.95 has been applied to their financial prices.
The economic price of seed and miscellaneous charges has been assumed to
approximate the financial price. The economic price of a bullock/day was
derived from the rental price for one pair with an operator per day, adjusted
by the SCF. A summary of economic prices is presented in the main report,
Table T-19.
Agricultural Wages
7.        Wage rates in the project area vary seasonally from Rs 2 to 5 per
man-day for rainfed agriculture, and from Rs 3 to 6 per man-day for irrigated
agriculture activities. Seasonal variations were averaged out by adopting
seasonally weighted daily wage rates:
Employment                 Employment
Rainfed     Period       Irrigated      Period
(Rs/man-day) (months)      (Rs/man-day) (months)
Slack season              2.0          3              3.0           3
Intermediate season       3.5          7              4.0           6
Peak season               5.0          2              6.0           3
Average (year)      3.4                         4.3
Economic wage rates were derived from the financial ones assuming that for
the slack and peak period, the financial wage is a good approximation for
the shadow wage (reservation wage), and that only during the intermediate
season the financial wage overstates the opportunity cost of labor by some
40%. To the weighted average shadow wage rates derived, the SCF (0.8) was
applied, resulting in economic wages of Rs 2.2 and Ks 3.0 for the rainfed

and irrigated areas, respectively. When compared to financial wage rates,
this is equivalent to an unskilled labor conversion factor of about 0.67.
Benefits
8.        Crop Budgets.  Assessment of future yields, "with" as well as
"without" project, was based on (i) farm surveys in the project areas; (ii)
yield statistics; and (iii) direct information in the field. Project yields
represent an estimate of the average yield which can be expected under assured
and timely water-supply conditions in an average year, assuming satisfactory
supporting services, especially extension. The "without" project yield
estimates were based on present agricultural practices adjusted upwards by
about 15% to take account of past productivity trends.
9.        Cropping Patterns.  The "future without project" cropping patterns
were estimated on the basis of the present situation in the project area with
an allowance for storage reservoir works recently completed in MKP scheme for
which the benefits are in the process of building up (see para 10). Projected
"future with project" cropping patterns are based on assumptions about farmers'
behavior under conditions of water delivery systems that functions effectively.
These assumptions were tested and confirmed by results derived from linear
programming models which were also used to estimate farmers' behavior. "Pre-
sent" and "future with project" crop patterns are detailed in SDV, Annex 6.
10.       Build-up Rates.  The gradual transition from the present subsistence
agriculture to modern agricultural practices (as a result of an assured and
timely water supply) was estimated to take five years in areas already irri-
gated and seven years in cultivated areas which are presently rainfed.
11.       Future Without Project.  The existing irrigated area in MRP scheme
averages about 224,000 ha per annum. Completion of Dudhawa (1978) and
Ravishankar (1979) reservoirs have not yet been reflected in present crop
production. For the project analysis, it has been assumed that in 70,000 ha
of the present irrigated area the transition to the "future with project"
cropping pattern in the kharif season can take place without the additional
investments under this project. There is sufficient capacity in the existing
main canal and water availability to compensate for existing system ineffi-
ciencies and thus enable this cropping transition to take place. In addition,
it has been assumed that about 24,000 ha of the existing irrigated area can be
put to the future rabi cropping pattern (Table T-17, main report) using sur-
plus storage water immediately available to the MRP scheme area. The build
up rate for the kharif and rabi crops in the "future without project" condi-
tion would be similar to those made for the "with project" situation. For the
project analysis in the HB scheme, it has been assumed that there will be no
change in cropping patterns or crop yields from the present situation until
construction of Bango Dam is substantially complete (1986). Without storage,
the transition to early planted kharif paddy cannot take place and that there
will be no water available for rabi or perennial crops.
12.       Rate of Development.  The implementation schedule of block develop-
ment by year, for MRP and HB schemes, is given in Tables 2 and 3 of this
Annex.  The tables show whether block irrigated areas developed under the



-97.                        ANNEX 3
Page 5
project are from present rainfed areas or areas served by the existing irriga-
tion systems. The tables also show those areas which (i) at present can be
served to "future with project" water supply standards using water available
from completed reservoirs; and (ii) would be developed under the project (hb
scheme) but cannot generate project benefits until Bango Dam is complete.
Costs
13.       Costs to Irrigation Users.  All investment costs in the development
of water resources to serve irrigation and the municipal and industrial water
supply (M&I) components were divided in proportion to the average annual
volume of water allocated. Thus, about 85% of the cost of the Sondur and
Pairi Dams, Sondur, Mahanadi and Pairi feeder canals, as well as 85% of the
Bango Dam were allocated to the irrigation component while the remainder was
allocated to the M&I components and therefore excluded from the cost streams.
14.       Irrigation Component.  Capital cost estimates based on July 1981
market prices and proposed implementation schedules were adjusted by the CCF;
they exclude sunk costs (the benefits from sunk costs are largely incorporated
in the 'without project' estimates) and price contingencies.
15.       Land Acquisition and Resettlement Costs.  There are three elements
of direct financial land acquisition costs to the project: (i) resettlement
costs for property lost to submergence in the reservoir areas (4,250 and 1,400
families in MRP and HB schemes, respectively); (ii) compensation costs for
areas submerged when reservoirs constructed under the project are commissioned
(about 300 ha, 3,606 ha and 5,520 ha in Sondur, Pairi and Bango reservoirs,
respectively); and (iii) the compensation costs for land acquired so that the
canal distribution systems can be constructed (about 7,500 ha and 10,500 ha in
MRP and HB schemes, respectively).
16.       It is assumed that all cultivated land lost to cultivation as a
result of the project is and would remain rainfed. The net CCA of the rainfed
area has been taken as 5% larger than the net CCA which can be irrigated after
completion of the canal distribution systems. Land acquired for the distribu-
tion systems is assumed to be lost to rainfed cultivation from the year that
the project works are constructed. Cultivated land submerged in reservoir
areas is assumed to be lost to cultivation as follows: half in the year prior
to completion of the dam, and totally in the year of completion. The schedule
of land to be acquired for project works and the economic cost of land acqui-
sition are detailed in Table 4 of this Annex.
17.       The economic cost of resettlement is calculated by multiplying the
financial cost by the construction conversion factor (CCF). Where the cost
of land acquisition is concerned, the real cost to society is the opportunity
cost; that is, the production foregone by the submersion of the land in the
reservoirs and the loss of lands acquired for the construction of the distri-
bution system. The per ha value of production in the "future without project"
situation was taken to represent this opportunity cost and was deducted from
the benefit stream.

ANNEX 3

18.       Operation and Maintenance Costs.  At present, the financial costs
of O&M are estimated at about Rs 70/ha for the existing irrigated areas
although provisions average only about Rs 36 per ha. It is estimated that
about Rs 100/ha would be needed to assure proper O&M. O&M involves mostly the
employment of unskilled or semiskilled labor and therefore the unskilled labor
conversion factor of 0.67 was applied.
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Net Present Value
19.       The economic cost of all civil works, equipment, land acquisition
and resettlement, administration and engineering, operation and maintenance
costs have been included in the derivation of the ERR. Discounting costs
and benefits over a 50 year period, the estimated ERR and the net present
value at 10% and 12% interest rate for the two schemes at full development are
as follows:
ERR   Net Present Value
(Rs M)
10%     12%
MRP Scheme                   20    2,641   1,532
HB Scheme                   22    3,389   2,085
WUhole Project              21    2,515   1,834
Sensitivity Analysis
20.       Several tests were performed to evaluate the sensitivity of the
assumptions made in the economic analysis (see para 6.07, main volume).
Additional details are presented below.
a.   Price of Paddy (see para 5).  If India would remain a net
importer of rice the economic price would be about 4% higher
than assumed in the base calculation, and the ERR would rise
to about 21% and 23% for MRP and HB schemes, respectively.
b.   Cost Allocation.  To examine the sensitivity of the ERR to
the assumed cost allocation, the water allocated to the
Municipal and Industrial (M&I) users was evaluated at the
opportunity cost of that water in agriculture. The oppor-
tunity cost of wat r was estimatel by a linear programming
model at Rs 0.51/m  and Rs 0.33/m  at the reservoirs for
MRP and HB Schemes, respectively. The ERR using this alter-
native approach would be 21% and 22% for MRP and HB Schemes,
respectively.
c.   Implementation Schedules.  The effect of construction delays
would result in higher overall project costs and would slow
down the transition process to future benefits in the
project areas. Construction delays could result due to
shortages of construction materials which are in limited
supply. In the last five years, only 63% of the cement



-99-
ANNEX 3
Page 7
requirements of MP irrigation schemes have been met. Con-
struction delays could result in a temporary surplus of
water in the initial years which might create pressure to
allow cultivation of "summer season" paddy (cultivated from
liarch to June). If the development program would be
delayed by 5 years, the ERR would decline to 19% for MRP
scheme and 20% for RB scheme.
d.   Rabi Benefits.  The rainfall pattern in the project area is
highly variable both annually and seasonally. In some years,
no rabi crops could be grown in the MKP command because rabi
cropping would receive the lowest priority in water supply.
An extreme case of permanent shortage was analyzed by
assuming that no rabi irrigation would be possible in the
MRP scheme in any year. The ERR would then be reduced to
18%. A 50% reduction in rabi benefits in HB scheme, would
reduce the EER to 20%.
e.   Budgetary Constraints I.  The implications of serious budgetary
constraints beyond the five year time slice were tested for
both MRP and HB schemes. The elimination of Pairi Dam and
Pairi Link Canal in the MRP scheme would reduce the irrigated
area by about: 9,100 ha directly served by the Pairi Dam,
reduce water supply, and limit the operational flexibility
in the rest of the irrigation system. The EKR would decrease
to 17%. The elimination of Sakti (34,430 ha) and Kharsia
(63,400 ha) branch canal commands in the HB scheme with start
of construction scheduled under the project for 1987/88 and
1988/89 respectively would reduce the ERR to 18%. 1/
f.   Budgetary Constraints II.  The unlikely possibility of term-
inating development beyond the five year time slice was tested
for both schemes.  In this event all works would be discon-
tinued with only 69,000 ha in MRP scheme and 85,000 ha in
HB scheme fully developed. The ERR would decrease to 14% and
16% for MRP and HB schemes respectively.
Cost and Rent Recovery
21.       Estimates of cost and rent recoveries used in this report (Table
T-25 and T-26) were based on the following assumptions: (i) water related
charges would remain unchanged (in real terms) in the next 10 years; (ii)
the charges would be gradually raised from year 11 until they reach 30% of
the incremental project rent in year 22; (iii) the increment for indirect
cost recovery per ha from taxes on agricultural production would reach about
1/   Assuming that irrigation intensity in the rest of HB scheme would not
change.



-100-
ANNEX 3
Page 8
Rs 100 at full development; (iv) O&M costs would amount to Rs 100/ha; and
(v) cost and revenue streams are discounted at 12% per annum over 50 years.
Under these assumptions the rent recovery indexes would amount to 30% and
34% for MRP and HB schemes, respectively. Full recovery of the resources
invested in the project over a period of 50 years at 12% per annum would
require an average annual recovery of about Rs 700 per ha of CCA. The
average annual recovery through water related charges and agricultural taxes
is estimated at Rs 230 per ha of CCA. The Cost Recovery Index (average for
MRP and HB schemes) would therefore amount to about 33% (Table T-26).

1/ A build-up rate of agricultural production for each commissioned irrigation block was assumed to take 5 years in presently
irrigated areas and 7 years in areab presently rainfed,
2/ Includes 34,000 ha of Pairi Command.
3/ In the 'without' project situation, storage water from Ravishankar Dam (completed in 1979) would provide irrigation for
about 70,000 ha to the project standards without additional investment.
