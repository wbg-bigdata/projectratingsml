THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
Loan/Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:       People's Republic of China.
Beneficiary:    Miniptry of Railways (MR).
Amount:         Bank loan:  US$160.0 million equivalent.
IDA credit: SDR 63.0 million (US$70.0 million equivalent).
Terms:          Bank Loan:  20 years including 5 years of grace at standard
variable interest rate.
IDA Credit: standard.
ProJect
Description:  This will be the Bank Group's third involvement in the railway
subsector. The proposed project would support the Government's
objectives of increasing railway capacity and improving its
operations and efficiency. It would also further develop MR's
technical and managerial capabilities and oontribute to the
overall economic growth of the country. The project will con-
sist of five components: (a) upgrading and electrification of
the 456 km single track line between Chongqing in Sichuan pro-
vince and Guiyang in Guizhou province; (b) upgrading and elec-
trification of the 704 km single track line between Yingtan in
Jiangxi province and Xiamen in Fujian province; (e) increasing
the capacity of the Xi'an Railway Signalling Factory, which is
a part of the China Railway Signal and Communication Company,
and improving the quality of its production; (d) introducing
mechanized track maintenance on a pilot project basis by pro-
viding equipment, technical assistance and training; and (e)
supporting the continuation of the Traffic Costing study, ini-
tiated under the First Railway Project (Loan 2394-CHA). The
electrification works involve proven technology that is already
in wide use in China and elsewhere in the world; technological
risks are therefore small. Similerly, the modernization of the
Xi'an factory carries little risk, since it will include the
participation of an established foreign manufacturer. The
Ministry of Railways has successfully completed similar pro-
jects for a number of years; risks from inadequate project
implementation and operation are therefore negligible. There-
fore, the risk is low that the benefits of the project would
fall substantially short of projections.

I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
1.01      The structure of China's economy, which for three decades emphasized
heavy industry at the expense of light industry and the service sector, is
still inherently "transport intensive," despite recent reforms of the sectoral
priorities. Chinese policy statements repeatedly identify transportation and
energy shortages as the two most critical bottlenecks in the eoonomy. Coal is
at the heart of both problems, beoause coal is simultaneously the most impor-
tant source of energy and the largest user of transport capacity. This dual
problem with coal is exacerbated by China's high level of energy consumption
per unit of GDP (about two and a half times that of other LDCs). However, the
need to ship large volumes of coal is not the sole cause of the transportation
bottleneck.
1.02      The rapid growth of China's economy in recent years has naturally
entailed a growing demand for the shipment of commodities of all sorts, and for
passenger travel as well. Efforts to reduce waste within the transport system
(for example by eliminating cross hauling of the same eommodity, increasing the
processing of raw materials before shipment, and increasing the intensity of
road and waterway utilization) are certainly desirable.  More fundamentally,
however, the Government's str-ategy for solving transportation shortages will
have to rely on an expansion of the system's capacity, primarily by increasing
the productivity of existing facilities wherever possible, and secondarily by
building new faoilities where needed.
1.03      Freight Traffic.  Domestic freight transported in 1984 reached 1,131
billion ton-km (tkm), more than a 15-fold increase since 1952, or an average
annual growth rate of almost 9%, systematically higher than the growth of do-
mestic product. By the year 2000, domestic freight traffic could be in the
range of 3,000 billion tkm, or nearly three times the 1984 level. The modal
split has moved toward a more balanced use of modes, but the railways still
handle 64% of the traffi versus 82% in 1952; this predominance is expected to
continue for quite some time.
1.04      Passenger traffic reached 362 billion passenger-km (pkm) in 1984, a
14.6-fold increase since 1952 and an average annu&l growth rate of almost 9%.
Since 1978, growth has averaged 13% p.a. This illustrates the potential demand
for travel as income grows. It is likely that this growth would have been even
more rapid if it had not been oonstrained by the limited capacity, particularly
of the railways, to offer more passenger services. The modal split has shifted
more rapidly than for freight, and the railways now handle 56% of the traffic
versus over 80% in 1952. Despite the rapid growth of passenger traffic in
recent years, the mobility of people in China is still much lower than in coun-
tries of comparable income levels. By the turn of the century, passenger traf-
fic may well reach about 1,500 billion pkm per year or about four times current
levels.



-2-
1.05      Investments.  Over the period 1953-84, some X 136 billion, or 14% of
all new investments under central government control, went to transport (Table
1.1). In comparison with other oountries, annual levels of transport investment
appear somewhat on the low side, a factor contributing to make transport a
bottleneck to economic development. For example, by 1983, 30 million tons of
coal had accumulated in Shanxi for lack of transport, and some of this stock-
piled coal was destroyed by spontaneous combustion. Despite a recent policy of
curtailing production to match available transport, the volume of coal stock-
piled in Shanxi increased during 1984. Rural areas are short of transport, both
for agriculture and for local enterprises. In the ports, lack of proper han-
dling facilities is hampering trade of bulk commodities such as fertilizers,
cement and grain. In the forthcoming decades, a much larger investL_-t effort
will be needed in transport if these bottlenecks are to be overcome.
1.06      Port traffic has grown rapidly since 1976, reflecting the economic
opening of China to foreign trade. Annual growth has averaged 11.3%. Domestic
coastal shipping and inland water transport also increased substantially. As a
result, ports became congested despite commendable efforts to achieve high pro-
ductivity. A major effort to modernize ports started in the early 1970s and
continues with particular emphasis on container and bulk terminals, the latter
mainly for coal. The Bank Group's first transport operation in China was the
Three Ports Project (Loan 2207-CHA, 1982), which includes container terminals
at Huangpu, Shanghai, and Tianjin, and a coal berth at Huangpu. A second port
project, which will provide eleven additional berths at Tianjin, is now being
considered for Bank financing.
1.07      The highway network comprised about 915,000 km in 1983, of which
about 180,000 km were asphalt paved, about 510,000 km were gravel or sand
paved, and the remainder were earth roads. Despite impressive expansion of the
road network since 1949, when only some 80,000 km of roads suitable for motor
-ehicles existed, the roads in China today are inadequate because: (a) pavement
strength and quality are poor; (b) there are many thousand kilometers of ex-
tremely rough macadam surfaced roads with traffic in excess of 300 average
daily traffic (ADT); (c) congestion is severe near cities, due to mixed slow
and fast moving traffic; and (d) there are gaps of about 4,000 km on major
national roads linking large cities and provincial capitals. The road network
and road transport in China today can therefore be characterized as under-
developed. Road maintenance, however, is well organized and currently absorbs
much of the attention and resources of the provincial and other local road
authorities.
1.08      Except for western China, the highway network is still very much a
system of feeder roacs to the railways. Nevertheless, motor traffic has grown
at a very high overall annual average of 15% on the national highways since
1978. The Bank's First Highway Project (Loan 2539-CHA/Credit 1594-CHA, 1985)
involves the construction or improvement of about 290 km of national roads and
about 1,400 km of rural roads.
1.09      Transport Issues and Objectives in the 1980s.  The transport system
has been severely taxed by the recent economic development, and capacity con-
straints are evident in all modes. At present, railway transport is a greater
constraint on energy supplies than coal mine development. Recently initiated



-3-
projects of line electrification and new line construction are addressing the
problem although it will take several years to alleviate bottlenecks between
major mining areas and coastal cities. Improved freight car technology and
other operational improvements could also contribute to capacity increases.
China will also need to expand substantially its port and waterway facilities
for domestic and foreign trade. But the most serious transport need is for dra-
matically expanded road transport, especially in rural areas where increased
specialization has created an urgent demand for better farm-to-market transport
services. It is widely recognized in China that road transport should and will
play a larger role in the future. Yet there seems to be no strategic plan to
bring this about. There is a need for more efficient trucks of both larger and
smaller size, as well as for more and better roads to handle the traffic.
Potential sources of financing for road development, such as road user charges,
need to be investigated as they could generate sufficient funds for an acceler-
ated construction and betterment p-ogram as well as contributing to an econom-
ically appropriate division of traffic between modes. Considerable efficiency
gains could be made in the entire transport system through better intermodal
coordination, which has thus far been impeded by the vertical and self-
contained organization of transport and other sectoral agencies. Through con-
tainer transport from origin to destination is still the exception. Changes in
policy, pricing and management of the system are needed to maximize the bene-
fits of intermodal transport. To support all the development referred to above,
staff development and training will be an important objective in the sector.
II. THE RAILWAY SUBSECTOR
Oroaization
2.01      The principal agency in the subsector is the Ministry of Railways
(MR), with a staff of some 3.1 million, which administers a nationwide, inter-
connected system of 52,000 route-km. Other railroads are administered by the
Ministries of Coal Industry, Forestry, and Communications for uses associated
with their own operat.Zons, and by provincial governments for limited services
within their own jurisdictions. The Chinese system is the fifth largest and
carries the second highest freight and passengc' traffic in the world.
2.02      Four Vice-Ministers and a Chief Engineer support the Minister of
Railways in administering 19 bureaus concerned with speeific functional aspects
of MR's work, and 13 regional administrations which are responsible for opera-
tions. MR's organization chart is at Annex 1. The regional administrations are
organized in the form of State-owned enterprises, which are self-accounting,
have authority over their own retained earnings, and have contractual capacity
and the right to hire and fire staff. Each administration is headed by a gener-
al manager, and is typically divided into a number of subadministrations, each
of which controls the basic units (stations, workshops, etc.) that are respon-
sible for day-to-day operations within its territory.
2.03      MR also controls a number of factories, which together provide the
greater part of MR's requirements of locomotives, passenger and freight cars,
ties, fishplates, etc., and nine construction companies which carry out most of



-4-
the civil works. Design, engineering and architectural services are also car-
ried out "in house" by a number of specialist bureaus. Signalling and communi-
cation facilities are the responsibility of the China Railway Signal and Com-
munications Compar.y (CRSCC), a State-owned enterprise under the directio-. of
MR. CRSCC will be a beneficiary of part of the proposed loan and credit, and is
further described at para. 3.11.
Education and Research
2.04      In coordination with the State Education Commission, MR operates 11
universities, 20 staff colleges for in-service training, and more than 2,000
schools with 100,000 teachers and staff. Eight of the universities provide
technical courses, two provide medical courses, and one is a teacher training
oollege. Itost of them now offer graduate programs. For high school graduates
unable to enter university, MR operates more than 60 vocational schools which
train locomotive drivers and other operations staff; MRt's other schools provide
primary and secondary education for an enrollment now exceeding one million.
Graduates of MR's schools proceed exclusively to employment in MR, but grad-
uates of MR's universities may be employed elsewhere.
2.05      The Ministry also operates the ten research institutes which comprise
the China Academy of Railway Sciences. Mostly, the institutes are concerned
with applied research and acceptance tests on new products procured locally and
abroad, but the institutes also provide instruction av Masters and Doctorate
levels.
Planning and Investment
2.06      On the basis of national production plans and origin/destination
tables for key products and of its own observation of passenger movement pat-
terns, MR develops five-year traffic forecasts by principal routes throughout
its network. At the regional administration level, these forecasts are trans-
lated into traffic density patterns and compared with existing line capacities.
From these comparisons are derived the railway's requirements in motive power
and rolling stock and in route capacity enhancement. Production sehedules and
work programs are developed for MR's own factories and construction companies,
and the total investment plan is submitted to the State Planning Commission
(SPC) for approval; SPC may indicate the need for some adjustment, and further
iterations of some on all of the process may be required, but finally a total
plan is evolved which is consistent (and integral) with the national five-year
plan. From this plan, various subsidiary plans are derived, including a man-
power development plan and a schedule of material requirements (in particular,
rails and other steel products) from external suppliers. At present, however, a
financial plan does not form part of the package.
2.07      In the 1981-85 Sixth Five-Year Plan (FYP), after falling to
1 1.4 billion in 1981 during a period of budgetary stringency, railway invest-
ments were increased to 1 2.6 billion in 1982, X 4.2 billion in 1983, and V 6.4
billion in 1984 (Table 1.1). The 1983 amount represented over half the total
investment in transport of 1 7.2 billion, but was still far short of the level



-5-
which would be needed to alleviate bottlenec a. The Seventh FYP (1986-1990),
now in preparation, will focus on upgrading existing facilities; the antici-
pated traffic growth (paras. 2.13 and 2.14) will be carried primarily by the
existing system. Nevertheless, expenditore levels are expected to be at least
equal to those of the Sixth FYP.
Budgets. Accounts and Audit
2.08      The expense of MR's bureaus forms part of the central Government bud-
get, and is not recovered from railway revenues. Operating costs of the region-
al administrations are controlled by annual budgets compiled at subadministra-
tion level. Accounting is likewise focused at the subadministration level, al-
though some basic procedures such as cash collection and disbursement are
decentralized tc the operating units. Consolidation of budgets and financial
statements is routinely oarried out only up to the administration level; con-
solidation at the overall system level (all administrations combined) is gen-
erally confined to income statement items (para. 5.01). The accounting system
is double entry, on the accrual basis, and accounting rules and procedures are
uniform between administrations. China applies a dual system of depreciation
comprising a basic provision of 3% and an additional "provision for major
repairs" of 3.5% of historic value of fixed assets. The Government is conscious
of the distorting effect of this handling of depreciation on enterprises' true
earnings position. Therefore, it decided on April 26, 1985, to switch to a
straight line depreciation system taking into coUasideration the anticipated
lifetime of assets. The date for application of the new system to MR has not
yet been decided.
2.09      In common with all ministries whose responsibility includes the su-
pervision of enterprises, MR contains an Audit Bureau, whose principal func-
tions are to monitor compliance with accounting rules and to evaluate the effi-
ciency of operations. MR's Audit Buxreau was established as recently as 1985,
and its procedures are being developed with a pilot administration. The Indus-
trial Transport Bureau of the State Audit Agency (SAA) also carries out test
audits of parts of MR's operations selected randomly. In particular, SAA will
audit the accounts of subadministrations which are beneficiaries of Bank loans
and IDA credits. At negotiations, it was agreed that the project accounts and
the financial statements of (i) the Chongqing, Guiyang and Fuzhou railway sub-
administrations; and (ii) the Xi'an Railway Signalling Factory will be audited
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank Group, and audit reports will be
sent to the Bank Group for review not later than six months after the end of
each fiscal year.
Railway Facilities and Rolling Stock
2.10      China's railway network more than doubled in size between 1949 and
1984, from 21,800 to 51,700 route-km.  The network now includes 9,700 route-km
of double track and 3,100 route-km of electrified track. Further double track-
ing and electrification works are in progress as present line capacity is in-
sufficient to meet traffic demands. The rail network is served by a fleet of
11,100 locomotives, 291,000 freight cars and 19,600 passenger coaches. At pre-



- 6 -
sent, 68% of tractive power is still steam, 28% is diesel and 4% is electric.
Rolling stock includes large numbers of older wagons and coaches, many in poor
condition and with high operational and maintenance costs. Traffic growth has
outstripped production of new units and the fleet is far from adequate (for
detailed data on the railway system, see Table 2.1).
Operations
2.11      Despite the limitations of network and rolling stock, rail operations
utilize track and equipment intensively and efficiently (Table 2.1). Freight
traffic density averages 15.0 million net tkm per route-km which is the highest
freight density in the world after the Soviet Union, and 50% higher than
freight density in the United States. China's passenger traffic density of 4.2
million passenger-km per route-km is also the second highest in the world, thi&
time after India. Passenger traffic density in the Soviet Union is roughly the
same as in China. Despite this heavy traffic density, track and other fixed
installations are carefully maintained, although the labor-intensive methods
now used are rapidly becoming inadequate for the maintenanee of trunk lines and
will soon become inadequate elsewhere under the traffic planned for the future.
2.12      Scope for utilizing track and equipment even more efficiently is
mostly limited to lengthening trains (freight4car turnaround time is already
extremely quick and it would be difficult to improve upon the present average
of 3.4 days). The average train now has 35 cars as 75% of passing loops are
only 650 meters long. Most of the remaining 25% of loops are 850 meters long,
which allows 50-car trains to run in some regions. A program is under way to
extend passing loops in more regions.
Traffic
2.13      Freight traffic on the railways has grown from about 100 million tons
in 1950 to 1.2 billion tons in 1984. Because of an increase in the average
length of haul, traffic volume in tkm has grown even faster, from 39.4 billion
in 1950 to 533.2 billion in 1978, averaging 10% p.a. Since 1978, growth has
slowed to around 4.5% p.a., but was again 9% in 1984.  Three quarters of all
freight traffie involves ten important basic commodities (including coal, iron
and steel products, grain and construction materials), and the shortage of
freight capacity has emerged as one of the key constraints on economic growth
(Tables 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4). The Seventh FYP envisions an annual growth rate of
6%, leading to a freight traffic of 1.7 billion tons by 1990.
2.14      In 1950, the railways carried about 150 million passengers; in 1984,
they carried 1,123 million (Table 2.5). The growth of passenger traffic has
been particularly rapid since 1978 -- that is, since the introduction of major
economic reforms. In just the six years from 1978 to 1984, passenger traffic
increased from 109.1 to 204.3 billion pkm, an average of 11% p.a.  This rapid
growth shows the high priority afforded to personal travel out of the extra
income generated by the economic reforms. Yet the mobility of people in China
is still low. Average per capita travel in India is about 800 pkm p.a., much
more than China's average of about 300 pkm p.a. This low mobility is partly due



- 7 -
to a shortage of transport infrastructure: there is an acute shortage of pas-
senger coaches, and on crowded lines passenger trains compete for space with
freight trains. The Seventh FYP envisions an annual growth rate of 6%, leading
to a ridership of 1.6 billion passengers by 1990.
Tariffs
2.15      In common with other sectors, the railways have changed their tariffs
very little since the early 1950s. Freight rates were inereased in late '983
for the first time since 1967, at which time they had been reduced, but passen-
ger rates, however, remained at the 1967 level. The 1983 freight rate reform
doubled the minimum chargeable distance to 100 km, and increased rates for 75%
of the commodities (including coal, cement, oil and fertilizers) by 23% on
average. As of end May 1985, the average freight haul of about 572 km yielded
an average gross revenue of Fen 1.68 per tkm, 57% above avevage operating
costs. The average passenger journey was 169 km, and this yielded a gross reve-
nue of Fen 1.78 per pkm, 65% above operating costs. To further discourage short
haul traffic, the Government introduced the following rate increases effective
June 1, 1985: (a) 36.8% for less than 100 km passenger trips; (b) 50% for
monthly suburban season tickets; and (c) I 4.00 per ton for freight transport
up to 200 km. It is too early to assess the effect of these rate changes on
MR's finaneial results.
Government Objectives and the Role of the Bank Group
2.16      The Sixth Five-Year Plan (1981-1985) allocated Y 27.5 billion, 16.2%
of total investments, to the transport sector. Of this, I 17.3 billion was for
investment in railways. These resources have facilitated considerable develop-
ment of the railway network, but not enough to keep pace with China's rapid
economic growth. If China is to achieve its goa. of quadrupling the %ross value
of industrial and agricultural outrut by the year 2000, the railway's expansion
and modernization must be accelerated. The Bank Group's strategy for the sub-
sector is to support this acceleration of railway expansion and the improvement
of operational efficiency. It will, in addition, assist MR in modernizing its
technical and management capabilities. The first part of the strategy is thus
to be responsive to the immediate material needs of China's railway system as
they arise; the second part is to help better equip the subsector with the
expertise it needs to tuanage the future development of the railway system.
2.17      The first project (Loan 2394-CHA, April 1984, presently being imple-
mented on sce1'dule) contained components to alleviate bottlenecks on two key
routes, and to increase locomotive production; the second (Loan 2540-CHA,
August 1985, Just entering implementation) focussed on further route capacity
improvements and the expansion of passenger coach manufacture. The presen4 pro-
ject will continue the provision of enhanced route capacity -- in this case
aimed at improving the flow of mining and agricultural products -- and will
provide both hardware and software to increase and modernize the manufacture of
signalling and switching equipment. Updated technology in track maintenance
will also be introduced.



-8-
2.18      On the software side, the first project initiated the design of a
traffic costing system, and a study team from MR has now examined railway cost-
ing systems in Europe and in the USA and has reported on its main oonolusioms
and recommendations. The second stage (supported partly from the first loan and
partly from the present one, para. 3.18) will complete system specification and
implement it on a pilot basis. The second railway project provided for the
startup of a major management information system study, which is just getting
under way in selected areas of MR. In the context of ongoing project work, the
Bank Group has also begun a dialogue with MR on aspects of total system plan-
ning and control, and will shortly present a seminar (with the assistance of
senior railway executives from U.K.) to demonstrate approaches to system man-
agement better tailored to MR's needs in the new era of economic reforms
(paras. 5.06 and 5.07). By such means, the Bank Group hopes, through the
instrumentality of future projects, to be of assistance to China's railway sub-
sector in its organizational development as well as in its system expansion.
III. THE PROJECT
A. ProJect Origin and Objectives
3.01      In January 1985, the Government requested Bank Group assistance in
financing urgently needed investments in the railway subsector. The objectives
of the proposed project would be to increase transport capacity on the Chong-
qing-Guiyang and Yingtan-Xiamen lines, to modernize and increase the production
capacity of the Xi'an Railway Signalling Factory, to improve the maintenance
of permanent way on heavy-traffic lines, and to support the continuation of the
Traffic Costing Study initiated under the First Railway Project. The proposed
project was prepared by the Government and was appraised in June/July 1985.
This project will make a direct contribution to the Government's overall plan
for increasing railway capacity to support sustained economic development.
B. Projeot Description
3.02      The proposed project would be the third step in the Bank Group's
long-term lending strategy (para. 2.17). The project oonsists of five compo-
nents designed to:
(a) provide much-needed additional capacity on the 456 km Chongqing-
Guiyang line, which supports vital mining and agricultural activities
in southwest China;
(b) provide urgently-needed additional capacity on the 704 km Yingtan-
Xiamen line, which is the major link between the Special Economic
Zone at Xiamen and the interior of China and carries important coal
and timber traffic;
(c) improve technolo3y and increase production at the Xi'an Railway
Signalling Factory, thereby providing essential equipment for the
upgrading of traffic control and safety throughout China;



- 9 -
(d) provide better maintenance for permanent way on lines with heavy
traffic density, where traditional labor-intensive methods prove
inadequate; and
(e) proceed with the traffic costing study started under the First
Railway Project, Loan 2394-CHA (April 1984).
(a) Chongoing-Guoiang Line Upgrading and Electrification
3.03      The Ministry of Railways proposes to upgrade and electrify the 456 km
single-track line from Chongqing in Sichuan province to Guiyang in Guizhou pro-
vince, most of which runs through difficult mountainous terrain. On the most
difficult section (the 16? km between Ganshui and Nangongshan) the 1984 traffic
of 5.14 million tons in the heavy (northbound) direction, plus six daily pairs
of passenger trains, was already in excess of normal operating capacity and was
achieved only by extraordinary efforts. Traffic on the remaining sections is
also approaching capacity. The ruling gradient on most of the route is 1.25%,
but there are two more difficult sections: the 32 km from Mengdu to Liangfengya
(2.2%) and the 69 km from Gelaoba to Jiuchang (2.0%). An additional major pro-
blem is posed by a four-km long tunnel in the central section of the line,
where the diesel locomotives overheat, especially in summer. Because of the
difficult terrain, double tracking or realignment would be far more expensive
than electrification. Electricity will be provided primarily by the 630 MW
hydro project at Wujiang, and secondarily by two thermal generating stations at
Chongqing and Guiyang.
3.04      U2gradint.  To achieve required capacity, sidings will be extended
from 750 m to 850 m on the Chongqing-Ganshui section and from 550 m to 750 m on
the Ganshui-Guiyang section. In addition, the track will be upgraded through:
replacement of 43 kg/u rails with 50 kg/m rails on the last 27 km equipped with
light rails; improvements to embankments, culverts and bridass; and increased
clearance, waterproofing and improved drainage of tunnels. Communications and
signalling would also be improved by replacement of the open wire system with
cables, possibly fiber optics, and installation of cab signals and automatic
train stop. The signalling component will include replacing board signals with
colored lights and replacing manually-controlled switches with remote-controlled
power switches.
3.05      Electrification.  The railway will be electrified in 25 kV, 50 Hz,
with booster transformers. The overhead catenary system will be a simple trol-
ley wire except for the Luohuang-Xiaba section (41 km), outside Chongqing,
where a messenger wire system will be used. A steel/aluminum contact wire with
a 215 sq mm section will be used on the main line; in sidings, the section will
be 173 8q =m.
3.06      There will be eight substations, four 20 MVA, two 15 MVA, and two
31.5 MVA, all with a standby transformer. The primary voltage will be 110 kV,
the secondary voltage 27.5 kV; all substations will be remote controlled. The
power system is shown on Map IBRD 19175.



_10 -
(b) Yingtan-Xiamen Line Upffading and Electrification
3.07      The 704 km single-track line from Yingtan in Jiangxi province to Xia-
men on the coast in Fujian province was built to low gradient and curve stand-
ards in the 1950s. The line's limited capacity has three causes: steep gra-
dients, lengthy sections without passing loops, and heavy curvature. The ruling
gradient for most of the line is 1.2%, but is exceeded in two sections: 44 km
from Zixi to Guangze (2.0%) and 51 km from Yong'an to Chengkou (2.2i). More
serious is the problem of long sections that have no passing loops, which oc-
curs because the line snakes its way through a series of narrow river valleys,
with a steep slope on one side and water on the other. Finally, there is the
problem of severe curvature: of the T04 km, curves occupy 372 km (54%), and
curves with a radius of 300 m or less occupy 193 im (28%).
3.08      Upgrading.  Line upgrading will consist of extension of a few remain-
ing short crossing loops from 450 m to 650 m, construction of new freight
yards, undercutting of ballast in tunnels to increase clearance, waterproofing
and drainage improvements in tunnels, replacement of overhead oommunication
wires by cables (possibly fiber optics), installation of radio communication
between locomotive drivers and train dispatchers, and installation of automatic
train stop; centralized traffic control (CTC) is also being considered but no
decision has been made yet on this.
3.09      Electrification.  The railway will be electrified at a voltage of
25 kV, 50 Hz, with booster transformers. The overhead catenary system will be a
simple trolley wire except in double-heading sections in the mountains (95 km)
where a messenger wire system will be used.
3.10      The line will have a total of 17 substations (5 of 31.5 MVA and 12 of
20 MVA, each with a standby transformer), with an average distance of about
40 km between the stations. The substations will have a primary voltage of 110
kV and a secondary voltage of 27.5 kV. The primary side will be protected by an
oil minimum circuit breaker and the secondary side by a vacuum circuit breaker.
All stations will be remote controlled. The estimated power required is about
95 MW and energy consumption is expected to be about 525 GWh per year. In the
beginning, power will be supplied by the existing integrated grid but in the
near term it will come primarily from two new hydro stations, both now under
construction:  300 MW at Shaxikou and 1,400 MW at Shuikou (Map IBRD 19174).
(c) Xi'an Railway Signalling Factory
3.11      The Xi'an factory is part of the China Railway Signal and Communica-
tions Company (CRSCC), a State-owned enterprise under the supervision of MR.
CRSCC was formed in 1980 from what had previously been a bureau of MR. Its
facilities comprise four signalling factories, three communications factories,
and two cable factories. It employs 16,000 workers, of which 2,000 are techni-
cians. Its primary responsibility is to meet the requirements of MR, which are
set down in the form of delivery schedules at six month intervals, and this
activity typically absorbs upward of 80% of its production, for which prices
are set on a cost-plus basis. The remainder is sold to local railway systems
and to the other ministries with railroad operations (para. 2.01). Besides



_ 11 -
being a supplier to MR, CRSCC also acts as its technical adviser and construc-
tion supervisor on signalling matters. These activities are organized in a
subordinate R & D company (Beijing Railway Automation, Survey and Development
Company) and three construction companies, all of which have undertaken pro-
jects overseas as well as in China.
3.12      The Xi'an Railway Signalling Factory (XRSF) is the largest and most
diversified of the four factories that produce signalling and electrical
equipment. It has about 3,200 employees, including 335 technical personnel.
Among its products are relays, switch machines, other signal parts, control
panels for diesel locomotives, and locomotive radiators.
3.13      System-wide, MR uses about 2,000,000 relays of the AX type manufac-
tured at XRSF. The AX relay has several shortcomings, which affect its relia-
bility in the field; its current life expectancy is one million cycles or about
15 years.  The Xi'an factory produced about 110,000 relays in 1984, near its
capacity limits, but is being asked to produce 220,000 in 1988, and 300,000 in
1990, of whioh only about 30,000 are for replacement and the rest are for new
installations. Yet, with the current life expectancy, replacements alone should
require about 133,000 relays per year. The proposed modernization of the fac-
tory would increase output to 300,000 relays p.a.
3.14      The model ZD6 switch machine, of which XRSF can produce about 6,000
per year, was designed for use with 43 kg rail and is too weak for handling 50
kg rail, especially in cold weather. The ZD6 sometimes fails in service, creat-
ing the risk of derailment. Since MR plans to upgrade its high density routes
to 60 kg (and eventually 70 kg) rail, a stronger, safer model is needed. The
Seventh Five Year Plan (1986-90) calls for XRSF to produce 12,000 switch ma-
chines per year in 1990, either the ZD6 or preferably an improved model, and
this target is far beyond the factory's current capabilities.
3.15      The factory needs better equipment and facilities as well as tech-
nical assistance and training. In May-June 1985, the Bank Group helped organize
a study tour for representatives of the Xi'an factory and CRSCC (para. 3.11).
The group visited six major suppliers of railway signalling equipment in four
developed countries. After this visit, CRSCC deeided to enter into a technical
assistance contract (not financed by the Bank Group) with an American supplier,
General Railway Signal (GRS) of Rochester, N.Y. The contraot includes techno-
logy transfer to the Xitan factory, technical assistance by GRS experts second-
ed to XRSF, and training of factory staff. Specifically, GRS will assist CRSCC
to modernize the Xilan factory, increase its capacity, and improve both the
design and the quality of the relays and switch machines produced. The Bank
Group's contribution will be to finance machine tools, handling equipment, and
other production and management aids.
(d) Maintenance of Permanent Way
3.16      Track maintenance has traditionally been carried out. manually in Chi-
na, although a few primitive mechanical devices are used for some operations.
The quality of the work performed by hand is not adequate, therefore the track
does not stay in good condition very long; regular maintenance must be repeated



- 12 -
at rather short intervals. In addition, there is a need to redo up to 60% of
the levelling adjustments right after they are completed, because the results
are not satisfactory. Traffic is increasing on many lines and the track dete-
riorates faster while time for track maintenance becomes shorter: manual main-
tenance is a slow process, no longer adequate for providing the track quality
and safety needed for present and future traffic levels. To prevent accidents,
slow orders are increasingly imposed, reducing line capacity at a time when
more capacity is badly needed. Better track maintenance methods are clearly
required and MR has now decided to mechanize some operations such as tamping,
levelling, lining, ballast cleaning and ballast regulating.
3.17      The proposed project will assist MR in determining the types and
numbers of mechanical equipment best suited to the Chinese conditions of heavy
traffic, short intervals between trains, and low wage levels. Equally important
is the design of a track maintenance program, the organization of track mainte-
nance teams, the adjustments needed in train operations to allow the use of
heavy on-track machinery, and the training of staff in operating atid maintain-
ing the new equipment. The proposed project will therefore, in addition to
providing financing for hardware, focus heavily on the important matter of
staff training (Annex 2 and Table 3.8).
(e) Traffic Costing Study
3.18      This study was initiated under the First Railway Project (Loan 2394-
CHA, April 1984). The study is progressing well and on schedule; the first
stage -- a study tour for MR officials to expose them to current costing sys-
tems in the U.S. and in Europe -- has been completed. The second stage will
comprise the specificatior of the system to be adopted by MR, and pilot system
implementation and training. Since this stage will not be completed by Decem-
ber 31, 1987, the loan closing date for the first project, the proposed loan
and credit will include funds (about US$300,000) to finance the foreign costs
of the study after that date. During negotiations, it was agreed that the Bor-
rower shall continue to carry out the study according to the terms of reference
and timetable agreed with the Bank under the First Railway Project, Loan
2394-CHA, and according to arrangements acceptable to the Bank Group under this
project.
Technical Assistance and Training
3.19      Training of staff in new technology and management is included in the
various components above. The corresponding technical assistance and training
program totals 333 man-months, of which 261 man-months are for training Chinese
staff abroad and 72 man-months are for technical assistance by foreign experts
in China. During negotiations, it was agreed that the program will be carried
out according to the outline and timetable given in Annex 2.



- 13 -
Cost Estimates and Financing
3.20      Detailed designs are completed for all project works. Quantities were
derived from final engineering, and unit prices are based on current world mar-
ket prices for equipment to be imported. The cost of equipment and materials to
be procured locally and not to be financed by the Bank Group was estimated on
the basis of current domestic prices. The estimated project cost, expressed in
January 1986 prices and including training and contingencies is about US$577.5
million, of which US$29t.0 million represents direct and indirect foreign ex-
change costs. Cost estimates are given in Tables 3.1 to 3.4 and are summarized
on p.14. The Government has requested a loan and a credit totaling US$230.0
million which would cover about 77% of the estimated foreign exchange cost. The
Government will finanoe other materials, equipment and oonstruction costs from
its own resources.
3.21      An average of 7.4% physical contingencies was included in estimated
project costs. Annual price escalation rates were applied to local and foreign
costs in accordance with Bank Group guidelines, as follows: 7.0% in 1986 and
1987, 7.5% in 1988, 7.7% in 1989, 7.6% in 1990, and 4.5% in 1991. The January
1986 exchange rate of Y 3.20 to the US dollar was used for the calculation of
the foreign exchange costs. The total cost of consultants to assist MR in track
electrification works and track maintenance mechanization is estimated at about
US$0.4 million. In addition, US$1.2 million will be earmarked for training MR
personnel abroad in track electrification works, signalling equipment techno-
logy and manufacture, and mechanized track maintenance (Annex 2); US$300,000
will be allocated to the continuation of the costing study.
3.22      The proposed Bank loan and IDA credit would finance:
(a) for the Chongqing-Guiyang and Yingtan-Xiamen lines upgrading and
electrification: rails, other steel products, timber and cement,
transformers, copper wire, insulators, power and signalling cables,
design and construction equipment, technical assistance and training;
(b)  for the Xi'an Railway Signalling Factory: machine tools and other
equipment needed to increase production to the required levels,
technical assistance and training;
(c)  for the maintenance of permanent way: the foreign exchange cost of
imported equipment, technical assistance, and training; and
(d)  for the Costing Study: the foreign exchange component of the con-
tinuation of the study beyond the Closing Date of Loan 2394-CHA.
A list of items to be financed by the proposed loan and credit
is given in Tables 3.5 to 3.9. A sumnmry breakdown of the project costs
(in January 1986 prices) and of the proposed loan and credit is shown in
Section E page 15.

D. Project ImDlementation
3.23      Upgrading and electrification of the Chongqing-Guiyang and Yingtan-
Xiamen lines will be carried out by the railways' own forces. This is common
practice with work on lines with heavy traffic. The Ministry of Railways is
well equipped and has experience in this type of work. In this case, the Second
and Fourth Design and Construction Bureaus will be responsible for track, eta-
tion and yard upgrading and the Electrification and Automation Bureau for in-
stalling electrification equipment. Implementation of the other components of
the project will be carried out by MR with the help of competent consultants
(para. 3.15). The expected implementation schedule is shown in Tables 3.10 to
3.12. The project is expected to be completed by December 1992, and the Closing
Date of the proposed loan and credit would then be June 30, 1993.
E. Procurement
3.24       Procurement of materials and equipment for electrification works and
of equipment for the XRSF will be subject to international competitive bidding
(ICB) in accordance with Bank Group guidelines for procurement, except for a
number of small items worth less than US$150,000 per order and totalling less
than US$4.0 million, which would be purchased on the basis of quotations re-
ceived from at least three potential suppliers. All bid packages valued at over
US$500,000 will be subject to the Bank Group's prior review of procurement doc-
umentation. In bid evaluation, Chinese manufacturers will be allowed a prefer-
ential margin of 15% of the CIF cost of competing imports. or the relevant pre-
vailing level of customs duties, whichever is lower.
3.25      For items not financed by the Bank Group, Government procurement pro-
cedures will apply. Such items comprise civil works, various local materials,
and miscellaneous equipment. The civil works involved in this project are not
suitable for ICB. They include a large number of small corcrete foundations for
the catenary masts all along the lines to be electrified, and clearance adjust-
ments on a few bridges; these works have to be carried out under heavy traffic.
Other civil works include lengthening crossing loops by 200 m each and minor
modifications to existing workshops at XRSF. Delivery of major materials such
as rails, other steel and cement is independently arranged by the owner and
supplied to the construction bureaus. In this case, such mater0als are to be
procured through ICB and financed by the Bank loan and IDA credit.

Note: Figures in parenthesis are the respective amounts
to be financed by the Bank Group.
F. Disbursement
3.26      Disbursement of the proposed loan and credit would be as follows:
(a) 100% foreign expenditures of the CIF cost of imported equipment and
materials; and
(b) 100% local expenditures of the ex-factory cost of locally procured
equipment and materials;
(c) 100% of the cost of technical assistance and training.
3.27      Domestic transport from port or factory would not be eligible for
Bank Group financing. Any savings under the loan and credit would be cancelled
unless otherwise agreed with the Dank Group. Disbursements against training and
contracts for goods and services valued at less than US$200,000 each would be
made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). To facilitate disburse-
ments for these items, a Special Account will be established with an initial
deposit of US dollars equivalent to SDR 900,000 representing about four months
of expected expenditures. Replenishments to the Special Acoount would be made
quarterly or whenever the Special Aocount is drawn down by 50% of its initial
deposit, whichever occurs first* Documentation supporting the SOEs will not be
submitted to the Bank Group but will be kept in the project office in Beijing
and made available for review by the Bank Group's supervision missions.



- I7 -
3.28      An estimated sohedule of disbursements is given in Table 3.13, where
a comparison is made with the Bank-wide profile for railway projects. Disburse-
ments are expected to be very similar to the standard profile. The schedule is
based on the assumption that the proposed loan and credit would become effect-
ive by September 30, 1986.
G. Environment
3.29      No negative impact on the environment is anticipated from the pro-
ject. The electrification of the 1,160 km of lines between Chongqing and
Guiyang (currently steam and diesel operated), and between Yingtan and Xiamen
(currently steam operated) will significantly reduce pollution in the area.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits
4.01      This project will make a airect contribution to the Government's
overall plan for providing the increased rail transport capacity that is essen-
tial for sustained growth of the economy. In particular, the project will sig-
nificantly improve transport capacity in the southwestern provinces of Sichuan
and Guizhou and the southeastern provinces of Fujian and Jiangxi, all four of
which rank below the median in terms of provinoial per capita incomes. Under
electrification, the Chongqing-Guiyang and Yingtan-Xiamen lines will carry
increased tonnages of coal, minerals, timber, iron and steel, grain, and other
key commodities, without having to curtail their essential passenger traffio.
The modernization of production of switch machines and relays at the Xi'an
Railway Signalling Factory and a pilot project in track maintenance will intro-
duce significant technological changes enabling capacity increases throughout
the syster. without large new infrastructure investments. Project benefits will
thus be well spread throughout the economy.
4.02      For this analysis, all inputs and outputs were evaluated in constant
1986 economic prices. As far as practicable, taxes were excluded from financial
prioes. Virtually all of the imported materials and equipment to be used in the
project will enter the country duty free. For traded goods, CIF prices of im-
ports and FOB prices of exports were used in estimating the cost of materials
and equipment, with due adjustment for the cost of inland transportation. The
official exchange rate was used to convert foreign currency figures to Renmin-
bi. A conversion factor of 0.5 was applied for unskilled labor oosts, while the
shadow wage rate was oalculated at tour times the actual wage for highly quali-
fied technical and supervisory staff.
B. Chonacing-Guiyang Line URarading and Electrification
4.03      After electrification, capacity north of Ganshui will be about 20
million tons p.a. (plus projected passenger traffic), while capacity south of



- l8a
Ganshui will be about 12 million tons p.a. Traffic levels in 1995 are projected
to be 13 million tons north of Ganshui and 8 mill4.on tons to the south of that
point, plus eight pairs of passenger trains daily. Coal, iron ore, iron and
steel products, and phosphate fertilizers are the key commodities moving north,
while grain and manufactured goods are especially important in the southbound
traffic.
4,04      The benefits are in terms of value added for the diverse commodities
that will be shipped on the line when additional capacity is available. Bene-
fits are measured as an average of the value added per ton of eoal and the
value added per ton of phosphate fertilizer, since these are the two major com-
modities transported on the line. Each ton of coal (a traded good) is projected
to be worth about US$50 FOB Shanghai in 1990, r-ising to US$59/ton in 2000 and
constant thereafter (all in constant 1986 US dollars). The combined production,
transport and handling costs between Guizhou and Shanghai are estimiated at
US$15 per ton. Thus, the value added per ton of coal is about US$35 in 1990,
rising to US$44 in 2000 and constant thereafter.  Each ton of triple superphos-
phate (TSP), also a traded good, is projected to be worth about US$204 at the
farmgate in north China in 1990, rising to US$219 in 1995 and constant there-
after (again, all in constant 1986 dollars). The combined production, trans-
port, and handling qosts of bringing Guizhou TSP to the farmgate in north China
are estimated at US$193 per ton. Thus, the value added per ton of TSP is about
US$11 in 1990, rising to US$26 in 1995 and constant thereafter. The Bank Group
is currently considering a phosphate project at Wengfu in Guizhou province;
increased capacity on the Chongqing-Guiyang railway will be essential to its
viability. For further details, see Annex 3.
4.05      Apart from the cost of the project itself, the cost streams also in-
clude the necessary complementary investments in coal mines, electrical power
supply, and locomotives and rolling stock. In the case of TSP, however, the
production costs already include the capitalized cost of mine development, and
therefore it would be double counting to include this cost again. The economic
rate of return (ERR) of this entire package of complementary investments is 23%
with a 25-year period for benefits (for details, see Annex 3 and Table 4.1).
Some of these investments have a life expectancy well beyond 25 years, but
benefits beyond the 25th year increase the rate of return only marginally.
4.06      A proposed realignment was surveyed in 1981 but was eventually re-
Je2ted as uneconomical; improved traction on the existing route is a more cost
effective solution to the capacity problem. As for the choice between electric
and diesel locomotives, a detailed comparison at economic prices (Annex 3)
shows that electric traction is strongly preferred, since it provides both
lower investment costs and lower operating costs.
C. Yingtan-Xiamen Line Uparading and Electrification
4.07      In 1983, the three sections between Yingtan and Yong'an, which to-
gether total 408 km (58%) of the line, were already operating at full capacity,
with maximum traffic of about 5.9 million tons p.a. in the heavy direction
(toward Xiamen). Estimated capacity of these sections after electrifioation
will be 15.4 million tons p.a., plus ten pairs of passenger trains daily.



- 19 -
Projected traffic in 1991 is nearly 10 million tons p.a. Coal and timber are
especially important commodities.
4.08      For this railway, too, the benefits of increased capacity are in
terms of value added for the diverse commodities that will be shipped. In the
recent traffic pattern, coal and timber have been particularly important (and
both have substantial potential for expansion) but containerized traffic moving
through the port at Xiamen may also become important. Benefits are measured as
an average of the value added per ton of coal and the value added per ton of
timber.  Value added for coal is measured as described in para. 4.04, except
that the combined costs of produotion, transport, and handling between Fujian
and Shanghai are estimated at US$13. Thus, the value added per ton of coal is
about US$37 in 1990, rising to US$46 in 2000 and constant thereafter. For tim-
ber, also a traded good, eaoh ton is projected to be worth about US$178 on site
in southeast China in 1985, rising to US$200 in 1995 and averaging US$214
thereafter. Harvesting cotts are estimated at about US$37 per ton, so the value
added per ton of logs is US$141 in 1985, US$163 in 1995, and US$177 thereafter.
For further details, see Annex 4.
4.09      Apart from the cost of the project itself, the cost streams also
include the necessary complementary investments in coal mines, forest develop-
ment, electrical power supply, and locomotives and rolling stock. The ERR for
this complete set of investments, including the electrification of the railway,
is 33% with a 25-year period for benefits (details in Annex 4 and Table 4.2).
4 10      Two proposed realignments have been surveyed but rejected due to
their high cost. A proposed new railway, running from Xiangtang to Longyan, has
been estimated to be even more expensive. Thus, improved traction on the exist-
ing route represents the most cost-effective solution to the eapacity probleu.
As for the choice between domestic diesels, imported diesels, and electrics,
electrification quickly emerges as the preferred solution as soon as invest-
ments and operating ca-ts are treated in terms of economic prices (Annex 4).
D. Xi'an Railway Signallina Factory
4.11      The planned expansion of railway traffic in China, both through the
building of new lines and -- more importantly -- through the increase of traf-
fic density on existing lines, will require an increased supply of track compo-
nents, of which switch machines and relays are important examples. The project
will help MR's factory at Xi'an to increase both the quality and the quantity
of its output, with switch -achines increasing from 6,000 to 12,000 p.a. and
relays from 110,00 to 300,000 p.a. The benefit of this production increase
derives from the foreign exchange saved by avoiding the need to import (see
details in Annex 5).
4.12      As shown in Table 4.3, the ERR to the proposed investment at XRSF is
68%. This high rate of return reflects two factors: the high oost of imported
components, and the generic advantage of relatively small, high-priority in-
vestments in a well-managed existing factory.



- 20 -
E. Maintenance of Permanent Way
4.13      The cost of inadequate traok maintenance is not highly visible. Aver-
age train speeds are gradually reduced as slow orders are imposed, and the
system's annual traffic capacity is reduced correspondingly. The loss, then, is
the value added of the freight that oannot be shipped because of capacity re-
strictions. Mission estimates suggest that an investm3nt of US$20 million, or
about X 64 million, would suffice to finance a pilot project under which track
maintenance would be improved on 4,000 km of the most heavily used routes,
where average traffic densities are at least 30 million tons p.a. and where
line capacity becomes critical. If better maintenance permits an average traf.
fic increase of only 1%, which is almost imperceptible, this translates into an
extra 1.2 billion tkm p.a. on the routes improved. A ton of coal, with a value
added of about 1 112 (US$35) and moving about 500 km, implies a value added per
ton-km of about Fen 22 which, when multiplied by 1.2 billion tkm, suggests a
benefit of V 264 million annually on an initial investment of 1 64 million.
These calculations are extremely rough, but they do suggest that the rate of
return to mechanized track maintenance on congested high density routes can be
very attractive, even in China where wages are low.
F. Overall Evaluation and Risks
4.14      Overall economic evaluation shows that implementation of all project
components is well justified and should proceed without delay. Even if an ex-
penditure of US$20 million is included in project costs for the mechanization
of track maintenance but no benefit is ascribed to ',is component, the overall
ERR is estimated at 30%. The electrification works involve proven technology
that is already in wide use in China and elsewhere in the world: technological
risks are therefore small. Similarly, the modernization of the Xitan factory
carries little risk, since it will include the participation of an established
foreign manufacturer. The Ministry of Railways has successfully completed simi-
lar projects for a number of years; risks from inadequate project Implementa-
tion and operation are therefore negligible. The constraints placed on China's
development by transportation bottlenecks insure that this seotor will continue
to receive Government attention and priority. The evident success of the recent
economic reforms, and the rapid growth of transportation demand that has accom-
panied the reforms, suggest that rail traffic is likely to grow as projected,
or even faster, so the risk is low that the benefits of the project would fall
substantially short of projections. Sensitivity analysis for the various pro-
ject components is shown in Annexes 3, 4, and 5. In no case does the ERR for
any component fall below 17%.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Financial Performance: MR
5.01      Since consolidated financial statements are not routinely compiled in
MR (para. 2.08), the financial results of railway operations can be only incom-
pletely evaluated. In particular, consolidated balance sheets are not available
for recent years, and hence it is not possible to establish with certainty such
values as capital employed, assets in use, or working capital, nor to compute
any performanoe measures related to those values. However, consolidated income
statements are available, since they are prepared in connection with the reve-
nue distribution system and to establish MR's income tax liability. Those for
the last four years are set out in Table 5.1 and summarized below:
----      - I million -----------
19281     1982     1483      1984
Revenue f1                            9,637    10,457   11,809   15,087
Operating expenses                    7,002      7,322    7,899    9,178
Operating profit                      2.635      3.135    3,910    5t.9.09
Other income/(expense)                  (419)     (358)    (424)    (506)
Profit before tax                     2,216      2.777    3,486    5,403
Income taxes and profit remitted      1,836      2,308    2,667    3,736
Retained earnings                       380        469      819    1.667
Operating ratio                           73        70        67       61
/1 net of sales tax.
5.02      The above results need to be interpreted with some caution, in parti-
cular with respect to the value of operating expenses. The costs of MR's cen-
tral bureaus are not included (para. 2.08); and provisions for major repairs
and depreciation may be understated since a number of completed projects have
not yet been oapitalized in the administrations' books. However, even with
these provisos, the results indicate a satisfactory growth of profits. While
profit growth was driven chiefly by the volume of traffic, careful control
of operating costs also contributed; unit oosts per traffic unit remained
virtually constant throughout the period. Freight revenues also benefited
from the tariff increases effected in late 1983 (para. 2.15).
Financial Arrgngements
5.03      Until recently, most of the net earnings of MR were remitted to the
State and formed part of the State's budgetary revenue. Retentions of profit



- 22 -
were permitted only for a small number of leu -ly defined purposes. MR obtained
all its funding for capital expenditure from the State in the form of grants
although the amount of funds so obtained was in no way related to the amount of
profits remitted. Investment authorization was conveyed to MR on a project-by-
project basis by SPC according to their assessment of overall national priori-
ties.
5.04      In 1983, a flat rate income tax at 55% was introduced.  For a transi-
tional period of three years, MR will continue to remit a further - virtually
fixed - amount of profit to the State. In 1986, this remission will be replaced
by a supplementary tax (the adjustment tax) on incremental profits above those
of the basis year 1985. Given the continuing growth of pre-tax profits, the
effect of these rather complicated arrangements will be to leave an increasing
proportion in the hands of MR. However, use of these funds is still restricted
to the purposes previously sanctioned for retained earnings, principally bonus-
es, welfare, and R & D; they are not yet available for capital expenditure. For
that, MR will continue to obtain funding from the State, but henceforward in
the form of loans through the Peoples' Construction Bank of China. The expected
terms are 3.6% over 20 years.
Future Financial Performanee: MR
5.05      At the present time, so many elements of MR's financial affairs are
in the process of change that it would not be sensible to attempt to quantify
future results. In the context of national reconsideration of the role of
prices in the economy, a number of MR's costs -- especially fuel and energy --
are liable to change; tax policies are in a process of evolution; and financing
mechanisms are being radically altered. In suoh changing circumstances, MR
could derive considerable benefit from enhanced procedures for planning and
control. Well developed techniques of project financial evaluation and invest-
ment planning are already in place (para. 2.06), and budgetary control is used
effectively to manage costs of operations (paras. 2.08 and 5.02). The Ministry
of Railways has recently sought Bank Group assistance in improving its manage-
ment information and costing systems, and measures to address these needs are
already in the process of implementation under the First and Second Railway
Projects. But the management process lacks the framework of an overall corpo-
rate plan -- and especially a financial plan -- to coordinate the individual
short and medium term planning mechanisms and focus the systems of control.
5.06      Until very recently, State systems of control made it unnecessary for
MR to think of itself in corporate terms, as shown by the lack of consolidated
financial statements (para. 2.08). New responsibilities increasingly require
the operational administrations of MR to be in a position collectively to:
(a) relate operational results to their new debt service obligations
(para. 5.04);
(b) evaluate the longer term effect of the intended policy of 100% debt
financing for capital expenditure (para. 5.04);



- 23 -
(o) assume control of increasing amounts of retained earnings (even
though their use is not yet fully discretionary - para. 5.04); and
(d) formulate and recommend tariff policies for services in a period when
costs may become more volatile than hitherto.
5.07      Such concepts have already been addressed in the context of the
broadening dialogue between the Bank Group and MR on financial and management
matters, and will shortly form the subject of a presentation to MR managers by
Bank Group staff and consultants (para. 2.18). The adoption by MR of suitable
financial planning procedures is a condition precedent to the formulation of
appropriate financial objectives and performance criteria, and none such are
therefore proposed for the present project. These are, in any event, sensitive
areas in which progress can be expected only gradually.
The Administrations
5.08      The administration is the highest level at which financial statements
are routinely prepared in MR. As a State-owned enterprise (para. 2.02), each
administration is self-accounting and administers its own retained earnings.
However, the extent to which each is able to control its own financial results
is clearly limited. Revenue is pooled as it is collected, and redistributed by
MR to the administrations in proportion to the volume of traffic they handle,
times a coefficient taking into account local factors such as type of motive
power and topography. Each administration is thus effectively able to influence
profit in the short term only through control of costs - though in this they
appear to have been quite effective (para. 5.02). In the longer term, capital
projects which augment the traffic capacity of individual routes will have a
profit effect on the administrations in whose territory the routes are looated.
Forecasts were made of the impact of the two electrification components on the
results of the Chengdu and Shanghai administrations, as summarized below.
ChongginW-Guiyang and Yingtan-Xiamen Line Upgrading and Electrification
5.09      The financial implications of these two project components have been
assessed by: (a) comparing operating costs and revenues in the first year of
electric traction with those of the present mode (the "with project" versus the
"without project" cases); and then (b) calculating the cash flow rate of return
on project investments over 25 years. The return on the investments oomprises
the savings on operating costs and the profit on the additional sales made pos-
sible by project implementation. Annex 6 describes the assumptions and methodo-
logy used for this analysis.
5.10      Chon2Ming-GuiYang.  Table 5.2 summarizes actual 1984 and projected
1991 and 1995 gross operating costs and revenues of the line In total and per
traffic unit. Further details are in the Project File. Because of the line's
difficult terrain and the use of expensive diesel traction, often in multiple
units, operating costs were about 60% above the network average in 1984 and



- 24 -
will remain well above this average even after electrification. Thus, the line
income statement currently shows a small operating loss (V 8.4 million) which
is, however, negligible when compared with overall network operating profits
(V 5,400 million). In 1991, "with project" unit costs are expected to be about
8% below "without project" costs, even though only 40% of the electrified
line's capacity will be used in that year. Unit costs will decrease further
with increased capacity utilization and the line is expeoted to break even by
the end of the century. Table 5.3 shows that the project is expeoted to gener-
ate a 7% discounted cash flow rate of return over 25 years, based on present
traffic, cost and tariff projections.
5.11      Yingtan-Xiamen. Table 5.4 summarizes "without project" and "with pro-
ject" line cost and revenue projections, actual for 1984 and as projeoted for
1993 and 1997. 'urther details are in the Project File. The 1984 line operating
cost of Fen 1.01 per traffic unit was very close to the network average, des-
pite the line's relatively difficult terrain, due to the exclusive use of cheap
steam traction and to the spread of the line's fixed operating costs and over-
heads. Due to the same factors, "with project" unit costs, although declining
with increasing utilization of the electrified line, are expected to remain
higher than the "without project" costs. The profitability of the additional
traffic made possible by the project is partly offset by this increase in unit
costs. As a result, the discounted cash flow rate of return the project is ex-
pected to generate is only 3% (Table 5.5).
5.12      Such financial rAturns do not prejudice the railways' overall profit-
ability, since they are insignificant in relation to total earnings. Neither is
the project justification called into question, since the economic rate of
return is very high. The significance of the results is that they suggest the
desirability of considering regional tariff supplements where local unit costs
differ significantly from the system average. This would represent a radical
departure from previous principles of rate fixing and may not be acceptable at
this stage. The ongoing traffic costing study will provide MR with the first
opportunity to review the adequacy of its rate structure.
The China Railway Signal and Communications Company (CRSCC)
5.13      CRSCC is the beneficiary of the third component of the proposed loan
and credit. The financial results of CRSCC are not consolidated with those of
the administrations summarized in para. 5.01. Hence, a separate analysis has
been made for this component to assess its impact on the financial performance
of the Xi'an factory, the production unit of CRSCC in which the project invest-
ments will be made. The factory is a self-accounting profit center and is one
of the "basic enterprise" units which together form CRSCC.
5.14      The project will finance the purchase of modern machine tools and
equipment to replace the existing obsolete ones which have been producing poor
quality products. Specifically, the quality of relays and switch machines is to
be improved and annual production increased from 110,000 to 300,000 for relays
and from 6,000 to 12,000 for switch machines in 1990, the year when the project
takes full effect. Furthermore, unit Costs of these two products will decrease
as a result of better production equipment and economies of scale. In financial

terms, the return on investment in new plant and machinery - represented by the
gross profit on the incremental sales and the inoremental profit on existing
sales - is 12%. The effect on the factory's results (assuming the mix of pro-
ducts remains unchanged) will be to yield a pre-tax rate of return of 28% in
1990. Although this is below the 1984 result (36%), the apparent decline is not
significant; 1984 was an exceptional year. The proportion of relays and switch
maohines in the factory's sales will remain fairly oonstant at about 30%, but
because of their reduced unit oosts, these products will contribute a signi-
ficantly higher proportion of total gross profit. Detailed calculations are
available in the Project File. Key figures are as follows:

Project Capital Costs
1.        Direct and indirect project costs are summarized in Table 4.1.  The
development of a conversion factor for the project capital costs is shown
below. The conversion factors applied to particular categories are based on the
data presented in the "Economic Analysis of Aluminum Milling in Shanghai" (the
EAAMS study). The resultant overall conversion factor, which has been applied
to direct project costs, is 1.19.

Complementary Capital Costs
2.        The proposed project will require complementary investments of sev-
eral types. Most directly, a high-voltage supply line will be needed to connect
the project with the regional power grid, and additional locomotives and rol-
ling stock will be needed to handle the increase in traffic. In addition, in-
vestments will be needed to expand the production of coal and other commodi-
ties to be carried. These linked investments are measured as follows:



-29 -                              ANNEX 3
Page 2
(a) High-Voltase Supply Line. This connection, which will be financed
by MR but built by the Ministry of Power, is estimated to cost Y 31.53 million.
The conversion factor is 1.21, under the assumption that about half the cost
will be construction (EAAMS conversion factor 1.08) and the other half equip-
ment (EAAMS conversion factor 1.34).  Construction is assumed to take four
years.
(b) Locomotives and Cars. The train load will be 3,500 gross tons on
the Chongqing-Ganshui section which has maximum gradients of 0.6%, and 2,100
gross tons on the Ganshui-Guiyang section with gradients up to 2.2%, The Chong-
qing-Ganshui section will require a tractive effort of 420 kilo-Newtons (kN);
parts of the Ganshui-Guiyang section with 2.2% gradienta will require 633 kN.
The SS#1 electric locomotives will be used overall, in double heading where
required. The price of a SS#1 is V 1.25 million (V 2.5 million in mountainous
terrain). The equivalent set of diesel locomotives would cost V 5.85 million.
Projected 1991 traffic levels will require 69 SS#1 locomotives, re-
placing the existing fleet of 66 diesel and 27 steam locomotives. Using the
EAAMS conversion factor of 1.34, the economic cost of the new locomotives can
be calculated as follows (with the diesels assumed to be 50% depreciated and
with no residual value assigned to steam locomotives):
Financial                  Economic
Unit Price       Total        Ratio          Total
No.        (X)          (V mln)                    (V mln)
electric locos       69      1,250,000        86.3          1.34        115.6
less diesels        66         725,000        47.9          1.34         64.1
net amount                                    38.4                       51.5
In Table 4.1, this investment is phased in over four years to allow
for supply constraints. The additional investment in rolling stock shown is for
the locomotives, freight cars, and passenger coaches needed in future years to
accommodate projected traffic increases.
(c) Coal Mine Development Costs. The cost of completely new mine de-
velopment has been estimated at US$56/ton for the Bank Coal Project (Loan
2501-CHA, May 1985). For the proposed project, the additional coal to be trans-
ported will come in about equal parts from (i) existing mines that could readi-
ly produce more coal when transport becomes available and (ii) new mines and
existing mines to be expanded. Therefore, development costs per ton of annual
capacity have been taken at half the cost of developing completely new mines.
Mine development expenditures are assumed to be spread equally over the five
years prior to production increments, according to the traffic pattern shown in
Table 4.1.

ANNEX 3

ProJect Benefits
3.        Coal Traffic.  The Chongqing-Guiyang line carries a diversified traf-
fic of passengers and freight, the latter including coal, phosphate fertil-
izers, iron ore, iron and steel products, grain, and manufactures. Coal, which
accounted for 22% of the tkm hauled in the heavy (northbound) direction in
1984, is the most important commodity by volume, followed by phosphate fertil-
izer with 12%. The price of coal FOB Shanghai is estimated to be US$50 per ton
in 1990, rising to US$59 in 2000 and constant thereafter (all in constant 1986
prices). These prices are based on Bank forecasts of thermal coal prices FOB
Hampton Roads, adjusted downward by US$5 per ton to allow for possiblo lower
quality of Chinese coal. Handling costs per ton are estimated at V 5 for load-
ing at Shanghai, V 15 for shipping costs on the Yangtze River, X 3 for loading
at Chongqing, and X 5 for railroad shipping from mine mouth to Chongqing. Oper-
ating costs of coal mines are estimated at V 21 per ton, based on data from the
Bank's Coal Project. Thus, at an exchange rate of V 3.2 to the US dollar, the
value added per ton of coal is about Y 160 minus (5 4 15 + 3 + 5 + 21) = V 111
in 1990, rising to V 140 in 2000 and constant thereafter.
4.        Phosphate Fertilizers.  In 1962, chemical fertilizer use averaged
about five kg per hectare; by 1983, average application rates had risen to
about 149 kg/ha. Although crop yields have increased substantially as a result,
further improvements are still possible, but they are hampered by an over-
reliance on nitrogen fertilizers. In 1983, China's nitrogen/phosphate applica-
tion was approximately 1:0.2, whereas its soils are estimated to require a ra-
tio of about 1:0.7 for optimal yields. Although Guizhou and Yunnan provinces
have very rich deposits of phosphate rock, serious transportation bottlenecks
in the region have impeded the development of this domestic mining industry. As
a result, recent efforts to solve the nitrogen imbalance have led to sharply
increased imports of phosphate fertilizers (about US$400 million in 1983). The
Bank is currently considering a major phosphate mining project in China, in-
cluding the Wengfu deposit in Guizhou. Initially, the Wengfu mine will have an
output of 3.5 to 4.5 million tpy, while eventual output could reach 10 to 15
million tpy. Expanded rail capacity on the Guiyang-Chongqing route will be
essential to the viability of this project.
5.        The net economic contribution of an extra ton of domestically pro-
duced phosphate fertilizer can be estimated in the following fashion. The world
price of triple superphosphate (TSP), CIF China, is estimated by Bank commodity
specialists at about US$187 per ton in 1990 (in constant 1986 prices), rising
to US$202 in 1995 and constant thereafter. At an exchange rate of 3.2, this is
equal to X 598 in 1990 and V 646 in 1995. Adding transport and handling
expenses of V 53 per ton, as estimated by the Bank's agricultural economists,
yields a farmgate price of V 651 per ton of imported TSP in 1990, rising to
V 699 in 1995 and thereafter. Bank mining specialists estimate that an inte-
grated fertilizer plant at Wengfu could produee TSP for an economic oost
(including a 15% retdrn to capital) of US$184 per ton, or V 589 at an exchange
rate of 3.2. Assuming an average distance of about 1,500 km from mine to farm,
and a cost of two fen per tkm, rail shipment would cost about V 30 per ton.
Thus, the farmgate price for TSP from Wengfu would be about V 619 per ton. The
difference between this price and the price of imported TSP measures the net
economic benefit of a ton of domestically produced TSP.

6.        Passenger Traffic.  The Chongqing-Guiyang route carries a substantial
level of passenger traffic, which is important both economically and socially
in this rather isolated region. Despite recent increases in short-distance rail
fares, which will encourage some shift of traffic to highway modes, the passen-
ger traffic on this railway is projected to grow at about 6% p.a., while
freight traffic is projected to grow at about 4%. The data shown in Table 4.1,
which cover traffic only in the heavy (nortnbound) direction, are derived from
the pkm and tkm figures of Table 5.3, with an adjustment for the fact that
backhaul traffic on freight is about 60%, while return passenger traffic is
virtually 100%. Because there is some rationing of both freight and passenger
services, it is not possible to use relative prices to measure the consumer's
marginal rate of substitution with precision. However, as a first approxima-
tion, the marginal rate of substitution has been taken to be 1.0, because
average tariffs per tkm and pkm are roughly equal. It is on this basis that
Table 4.1 shows total incremental traffic as the unweighted sum of passenger
and freight data.
Economic Rate of Return
7.        If the line's incremental capacity is assumed to be used entirely for
the carriage of coal, and if mine development costs, value added, and net
benefits are calculated accordingly, the ERR can be estimated at 26%. Alterna-
tively, if the capacity is used entirely to carry TSP, and costs and benefits
are calculated accordingly, the ERR is about 20%. In reality, the line will
carry a more complex mixture of traffic, which will undoubtedly vary through
time as circumstances change. However, since coal and phosphate fertilizer are
likely to be the two most important commodities in incremental traffic, and
since it can be presumed that other traffic will be permitted to displace these
commodities only if it is of equal urgency, the economic rate of return can be
estimated by dividing incremental capacity equally between coal and TSP, as has
been done in Table 4.1.  This yields an ERR of 23%.

10% Decrease                 27
Least Cost Studies
9.        Some modest improvements to the line's permanent way are economically
viable. Specifically, some of the stations south of Ganshui are only 750 m 'ong
and will be increased to a uniform 850 m, while additional crossing tracks will
also be added at some stations. Adding a few intermediate crossing loops would
provide a slight capacity increase, but this would be a difficult and costly
undertaking, since all suitable locations have already been used, and even some
existing stations are substandard in terms of gradients and curvature. A pro-
posed realignment was surveyed in 1981 but was eventually rejected as not
economically justified.
10.       Even with double heading (and the assistance of a third pusher loco-
motive at the steepest gradients), the domestic diesels now used have largely
reached their capacity limits. Another alternative to electrification would be
to equip the line with imported diesels, which are more powerful than the looal
models. At projected 1991 traffic levels, this would require about 141 imported
locomotives, at a cost of about US$1.25 million each, or 1 4.0 million at an
exchange rate of 3.2. Thus, netting off the savings from the local diesels re-
leased, as in para. 2 (b), the total net cost of the imported fleet would be
about Y 500 million. The corresponding economic cost of electrification would
be X 52 million for locomotives, as shown in para. 2 (b), plus the following
costs for fixed installations: 1 114 million for electrification works, I 33
million for the signalling and communications improvements required by eleetri-

fication, and Y 35 million for tunnel improvements. Thus, in total, capital
cost of electrification at Y 234 million is less than half that of the imported
diesels.
11.       Furthermore, electrification affords substantial savings in operating
costs, especially for locomotive maintenance and energy consumption. At the
traffic level of 10.4 billion gross CTK projected for 1991, maintenance Costs
on the 141 imported diesels will be about Y 9.8 million p.a., while maintenance
costs on the 69 electric locomotives and on the fixed installations will be
only about 1 2.5 million p.a., yielding annual savings of about 17T million.
Savings on fuel are even more dramatic; MR estimates that on this route the
imported diesels would use 38 kg of fuel per 10,000 CTK, while the electrics
will use 140 KWH per 10,000 CTK. At a world price of US$251 per ton, and a 3.2
exchange rate, diesel fuel for the 1991 traffic level will have an economic
cost of 1 32 million p.a.
12.       The Sichuan-Guizhou-Yunnan region in which the project line is
located is a mountainous area with substantial existing hydro power production
and with enormous potential for future development of hydro power generation.
The regional power grid is not connected to other areas of China, and Govern-
ment policy is to continue this self-reliance, because of the high cost of
building long-distance transmission lines. Thus, over the project benefit years
of 1991-2015, it is expected that electricity supplies will be adequate, and
will come from hydro stations during most of the time. During peak hours, how-
ever, the grid will also draw from thermal stations. In these circumstances,
the appropriate shadow price for electricity is less than the long-run marginal
cost of thermal production, which has been estimated at 11.3 fen per KWH. At a
shadow price of 10 fen per KWH, the 150 million KWH required by the projected
1991 traffic will cost 1 15 million.
13.       Thus, in 1991, annual savings in operating costs from electrification
will be 1 7 million on maintenance plus 1 17 million on energy.   Furthermore,
the savings will increase as traffic grows. It is illuminating to note that, if
the minimum acceptable ERR is taken as 12%, then electrification is justified
for any price of electricity up to about 56 fen per KWH, other factors held
constant.

Project Capital Costs
1.        Direct and indirect project costs are summarized in Table 4.2.  The
development of a conversion factor for the project capital costs is shown be-
low. The conversion factors applied to particular categories are based on the
data presented in the "Economic Analysis of Aluminum Hilling in Shanghai" (the
EAAMS study). The resultant overall conversion factor, which has been applied
to direct project costs, is 1.06.

Complementary Capital Costs
2.        The proposed project will require complementary investments of sev-
eral types. Most directly, a high-voltage supply line will be needed to connect
the project with the regional power grid, and additional looomotives and rol-
ling stock will be needed to handle the increase in traffic. In addition, in-
vestments will be needed to expand the production of coal and other commodi-
ties to be carried. 'rnese linked investments are measured as follows:



-35-                            ANNEX 4
Page 2
(a) High-Voltage Supply Line. This connection, which will be financed
by MR but built by the Ministry of Power, is estimated to cost X 87.22 million.
The conversion factor is 1.21, under the assumption that about half the Cost
will be construction (EAAMS conver-sion factor 1.08) and the other half equip-
ment (EAAMS conversion factor 1.34). Construction is assumed to take four
years.
(b)  Locomotives and Cars. The SS#4 locomotive (6,400 kw or 8,700 hp)
to be used provides a tractive effort of 380 kN at a continuous speed of 43
km/h. This is sufficient on most of the line exept in mountainous sections.
There, the train load of 2,700 gross tons will require a tractive effort of
about 700 kN, which would be provided by two locomotives (theoretically 1.8).
The SS#4 locomotive is made of two units, designed to operate in tandem and
therefore with a cab at only one end of each unit.
Locally made diesels are not powerful enough for the required train
load. The heaviest diesel unit available on the world market (3,750 hp) has a
tractive effort of 360 kN at a continuous speed of 25 km/h. For a speed of
43 km/h, the same diesel will give 213 kN, so that four units would be needed
per train load for the same line capacity. High powered imported diesels are
much more expensive than domestic electrics. Four such diesels would cost a
total of US$5.0 million, about US$330 per hp, against US$1.3 million for two
domestic electrics or US$75 per hp. Locomotive investments would be 3.8 times
higher with diesels than with electrics. Operating costs are also substantially
lower with electric locomotives and electrification is therefore the least cost
solution.
Projected 1991 traffic levels will require 113 SS#4 units, replacing
the existing fleet which is entirely steam. Using the EAAMS conversion factor
of 1.34, the economic cost of the new locomotives can be calculated as follows
(with no residual value assigned to the steam locomotives):
Financial                  Economic
Unit Price        Total       Ratio          Total
No.        (I)          (V mln)                     (V mln)

In Table 4.2, this investment is phased in over four years to allow
for supply oonstraints. The additional investment in rolling stock shown is for
the locomotives, fraight cars, and passenger coaches needed in future years to
acoommodate projected traffic increases.

(a) Coal Mine Development Costs. The cost of completely new mine de-
velopment has been estimated at US$56/ton for the Bank Coal Project. For the
proposed project, the additional coal to be transported will come in about
equal parts from (i) existing mines that could readily produce more coal when
transport becomes available and (ii) new mines and existing mines to be expand-
ed. Therefore, development costs per ton of annual capacity have been taken at
half the coat of developing completely new mines. Mine development expenditures
are assumed to be spread equally over the five years prior to production incre-
ments, according to the traffic pattern shown in Table 4.2.
(d) Forest Development Costs. Data developed for the Bank Forestry
Development Project indicate that development costs (including roads, equip-
ment, and the planting, tending, and fertilizing of the forest)-are about X 716
per ton of logs produced annually. In Table 4.2, these costs are spread equally
over the four years prior to production increments.
Project Benefits
3.        Coal Traffic.  The Yingtan-Xiamen line carries a diversified traffic
of passengers and freight, the latter including coal, timber, minerals, iron
and steel products, grain, and manufactures. Coal, which accounted for 32% of
the tkm ha4led in the heavy direction in 1983, is the most important commodity
by volume. The price of coal FOB Shanghai is estimated to be US$50 per ton in
1990, rising to US$59 in the year 2000 and constant thereafter (all in constant
1986 prices). These prices are based on Bank forecasts of thermal coal prices
FOB Hampton Roads, adjusted downward by US$5 per ton to allow for possible
lower quality of Chinese coal. Handling costs per ton are estimated at V 5 for
loading at Shanghai, Y 5 for coastal shipping, V 3 for loading at Xiamen, and
V 7 for railroad shipping from mine mouth to Xiamen. Operating costs of coal
mines are estimated at V 21 per ton, based on data from the Bank's Coal Pro-
ject. Thus, at an exchange rate of V 3.2 to the US dollar, the value added per
ton of coal is about V 160 minus (5 + 5 + 3 + 7 + 21) V Y 119 in 1990, rising
to V 148 in 2000 and constant thereafter.
4.        Timber Traffic.  Annual per capita consumption of forest products in
China is still quite low, although it has been increasing in recent years.
Expected income gains will almost certainly result in continued rapid growth in
demand for forest products, larger imports, and an increasing drain on foreign
exchange unless steps are taken to improve the utilization of indigenous
forests. More than 60% of China's standing volume of timber is mature forest,
while at the same time accessible areas suffer from over-harvesting. Inadequate
transportation is one of the main explanations of this paradox. In Fujian
province, forest resources are very rich, covering 48% of the land area, yet
the province has contributed only about 7% of national output of timber in
recent years, compared to Heilongjiang's 32% and Jilin's 12%.
5.        According to the data gathered for the Bank's Forestry Development
Project, the economic price of logs on site in southeast China, as derived from
projected world prices, will rise from V 569/ton in 1985 to V 640 in 1995, and
will then average V 686 over the succeeding decade. Harvesting costs will run
about V 119/ton. The difference between the harvesting costs and the economic



37 -
ANNEX 4
Page 4
price measures the net economic benefit of a ton of domestically produced
timber.
6.        Passenger Traffic.  The Yingtan-Xiamen route carries a substantial
level of passenger traffic, which is important both economically and socially
to the rather isolated interior region of Fujian and Jiangxi provinces. Despite
reoent increases in short-distance rail fares, which will encourage some shift
of traffic to highway modes, the passenger traffic on this railway is projected
to grow at about 7% p.a. until the turn of the century, while freight traffic
is projected to grow at about 6% during the same period. At these growth rates,
traffic will once again encounter capacity constraints at about the year 2000.
Although these growth rates are quite high, they seem plausible in light of the
rapid development that is oecurring in Fujian gelaerally and in the Special Eco-
nomio Zone at Xiamen more particularly. The data shown in Table 4.2, which
cover traffic only in the heavy (southbound) direction, are derived from the
pkm and tkm figures of Table 5.5, with an adjustuieit for the fact that backhaul
traffic on freight is about 60%, while return passenger traffic is virtually
100%. Bec4use there is some rationing of both freight and passenger services,
it is not possible to use relative prices to measure the consumer's marginal
rate of substitution with precision. However, as a first approximation, the
marginal rate of substitution has been taken to be 1.0, because average tariffs
per tkm and pkm are roughly equal.  It is on this basis that Table 4.2 shows
total incremental traffic as the unweighted sum of pt:ssenger and freight data.
Economic Rate of Return
7.        If the line's incremental capacity Is assumed to be used entirely for
the carriage of coal, and if mine development costs, value added, and net
benefits are calculated accordingly, the ERR can be estimated at 23%. Alterna-
tively, if the capacity is used entirely to carry timber, and costs and bene-
fits are calculated accordingly, the ERR is about 38%. In reality, the line
will carry a more comp.lex mixture of traffic, which will undoubtedly vary
through time as circumstances change. However, since coal and timber are likely
to be the two most impori;ant commodities in incremental traffic, and since it
can be presumed that other traffic will be permitted to displace these commo-
dities only if it is of equal urgency, the economic rate of return can be
estimated by dividing incremental capacity equally between coal and logs, as
has been done in Table 4.2. This yields an ERR of 33%.

Least Cost Studies
9.        Some modest improvements to the line's permanent way are economically
viable and are being undertaken. For example, some of the stations are only
450 m lorg and will be increased to a uniform 650 m, wh4le additional crossing
tracks will also be added at some stations. However, all the sites on which
passing loops can be built at reasonable cost are already being utilized. A
proposed realignment was surveyed in 1983, but it was found that 40% of the
existing track would have to be abandoned, making the realignment prohibitively
expensive. A second alternative that was considered was to realign only about
71 km of track at the two bottleneck sections, to reduce their ruling gradients
to the 1.2% standard of the rest of the line. At current prices, however, this
would cost about 1 535 million, for a relatively small capacity increase, and
is therefore not cost effective. Yet a third alternative that was considered
was to build an entirely new 474 km railway between Xiangtang and Longyan, at a
cost of about Y 3,331 million. This latter project may indeed need to be built
one day, despite its great cost, but for now the electrification of the
Yingtan-Xiamen line provides a lower cost solution to the capacity probleme
10.       Ai present, all the locomotives on this line are steam.  Extra
capacity could be provided by replacing them by domestic diesels, imported
diesels, or electrics. By contrast to the Chongqing-Guiyang line, where the
six-axle Shaoshan 1 will be used, this line will require the new eight-axle
Shaoshan 4, with its two-axle bogies better adapted to run on the extremely

tight curvature here. The projected traffic will require 246 domestic diesels,
235 imported diesels, or 113 electrics. The investment cost of these
alternatives is compared in the table below.

11.       Since operating costs are lower with electric than with diesel trac-
tion, it is clear from this tabulation that the SS4 is a better economic choice
than the imported diesel. Furthermore, although the initial investment is lower
with domestic diesels, this saving is quickly offset by higher operating costs.
Specifically, at projected 1991 traffic levels, annual locomotive operating
costs (not including depreciation) are about V 44 million with electrics and
I 100 million with t1he Chinese diesels, measured in economic prices. These
calculations assume an economic price of 12 fen per KWH for electricity and
US$ 251 per ton for diesel fuel. If the investment is spread equally over five
years and the savings accrue for 25 years, the ERR to the incremental invest-
ment in electrification is 28%.

Project Benefits
2.        China's railways require a substantial number of switch machines and
signalling relays each year, both to replace existing ones as they wear out and
to provide for the expansion of the system's traffic capacity. In 1984, China
produced 440,000 such relays (110,000 at Xi'an) and 11,000 switch machines
(6,000 at Xi'an). These production levels are very close to the capacity of
existing factories and MR estimates that, by the early 1990s, about 16,900
switch machines will be needed annually. Each switch machine requires about 45
relays, so the annual demand for relays will be about 761,000 units. After
modernization, the Xi'an factory will produce 300,000 relays and 12,000 switch
machines p.a. Modernization will begin with the Xi'an factory because it is the
only enterprise that manufactures both products. What is learned at Xi'an will
then be passed along to the other factories at Shenyang, Tianjin, and Tianshui.

ANNEX 5
Page 2
3.        If domestic production of switch machines and relays is not expanded
to meet the growing demand of China's railways, the shortfall will have to be
made good through imports. The CIF price of an imported switoh machine of simi-
lar characteristics is X 3,840, while the domestic cost of production is cur-
rently V 729; after the factory is modernized, it will be around V 577. Adjust-
ing the domestic cost by the EAAMS factor of 1.34 yields an economic cost of V
773. Thus, each extra switch machine produced in China saves X 3,067 of re-
sources. Similarly, the CIF price of an imported relay is V 256, while the
local economic cost is currently V 36, and will be V 30 after factory moderni-
zation. Thus, each extra relay produced in China saves V 226. These savings
represent the main benefit of the proposed investment in the Xi'an factory.
Economic Rate of Return
4.        As shown in Table 4.3, the ERR is estimated at 68%.
Sensitivity Analysis
5.        The main risks are that annual production levels will fall short of
projected quantities, that unit costs of production will be higher than predio-
ted, or that the upgrading of the factory will take longer than anticipated,
thereby delaying the benefits. The sensitivity of the ERR to these factors has
been tested as follows:

THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
Chongqing-Gui anB and Yingtan-Xiamen Electrification
Incremental Finanoial Analyses and Internal Rates of Return
Assumptions and Methodology
1.        Bse Year.  The base year for the analysis is the first year of full
operation of project investments. The attached Tables 1 (Chongqing-Guiyang) and
2 (Yingtan-Xiamen) show detailed calculations of fixed assets and related major
repairs and depreciation provisions.  Howeve-, depreciation charges related to
project investments are dot included in ope ating costs used for the analysis
since the capital column of this analysis acludes the full cost of these in-
vestments. Traffic projections and proje . investment costs are presented in
Tables 3 and 4. Details are available ir the Project File.
2.         "Without project" and "with project" cost calculations are based
on actual 1984 statistical and accounting data of the Chongqing, Guiyang and
Fuzhou subadministrations, allocated to the project lines. These data were then
updated to match the "without project" and "with project" traffic and costs and
revenue variations anticipated for the first year of full electric traction
operation. Staff, materials and service costs are in constant 1984 terms,
increased by 3% p.a. to reflect anticipated real cost increases. Energy cost
variations are based on estimates prepared by the responsible railway admin-
istrations, based on principles agreed with the appraisal mission.
3.        The incremental sales revenue was based on 1984 after-tax network
average unit revenues of Fen 1.43/tkm and Fen 1.51/pkm. These revenues,
increased in line with unit cost variations (in real terms) to calculate base
year's unit revenues, were applied to the additional traffic made possible by
project investments.
4.        Succeeding years.  The following assumptions and calculation methods
were applied:
Traffic:          Yingtan-Xiamen Line: Actual traffic for 1984 was 2.34 billion
phm and 6.63 billion tkm. Without project, growth is project-
ed at 3.4% for passengers and 5.1S for freight, reaching the
present eapacity at 3.15 billion pkm and 10.41 billion tkm in
1993. With project, growth rate will be 7.6% for passengers
and 7% for freight until 1993, then 6.9% for passengers and
5% for freight until the line reaches its new capacity in the
year 2000.



- 43 -
ANNEX 6
Page 2
Chongqing-Gulyang Line: Actual traffic for 1984 was 1.2 bil-
lion pkm and 4.6 billion tkm. Without project, growth rate
wi'll be 5.3% for passengers and 1.2% for freight until 1991,
when the line reaches its present capacity of 1.72 billion
pkm and 5.0 billion tkm. With Drojeot, growth will aceelerate
at 6.5% for passengers and 3.9% for freight until the line
reaches its new capacity in 2015.
Investments:      infrastructure: base year value of line fixed assets esti-
mated to increase by 1% p.a.
motive Rower and rolling stock: following calculations of
annual increases in numbers and values required for meeting
anticipated demand, as shown in Table 3 for Chongqing-
Guiyang and Table 4 for Yingtan-Xiamen.
Operating costs: "without" and "with" project:"
- 30% of base year costs fixed, 70% variable.
- fixed costs of each suoceeding year increased by 1%.
- variable costs growing in proportion to traffic.
Sales revenues:   base year unit revenues increased in proportion to annual
increases in operating costs applied to additional-traffic
made possible by project investments.
5.        Net benefits.  They consist of the incremental revenue generated
by the incremental traffic net of (a) project investment costs and (b) the
variation between "with" and "without" operating costs.
