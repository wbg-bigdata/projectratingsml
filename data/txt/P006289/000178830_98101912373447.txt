BRAZIL
APPRAISAL OF COPESUL PETROCHEMICAL PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Brazilian Government has requested Bank financing for the COPESUL
Raw Materials and Utilities Plant (the Project), which will form the core of
the country's third petrochemical complex (the Complex), to be located near
Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul (IBRD Map 13334). The Project will be 51%
owned by Petrobras Quimica S.A. (PETROQUISA), a subsidiary of the state oil
company PETROBRAS, and 49% by FIBASE, a subsidiary of the government-owned
Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico (BNDE). The proposed Bank loan
of US$85 million equivalent would cover approximately 10% of total estimated
financing requirements of US$836 million, and about 29% of total foreign ex-
change needs estimated at US$296 million. Remaining debt financing would be
provided by BNDE, US$242 million; the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB),
US$112 million; a syndicate of French banks, through a tied credit of about
US$22 million; and other commercial credits and loans totalling about US$41
million.
1.02      The Project will produce approximately 1.25 million tons per year
(tpy) of petroleum derivatives including primarily such basic petrochemical
raw materials as ethylene, propylene, butadiene and benzene for supply,
along with utilities, to at least seven second-generation (or "downstream")
units that will produce plastics and synthetic rubber. Private investors
will control or participate in all of the downstream units, whose output
is primarily for use by the domestic third-generation (or "transformation")
industries which will supply a large range of final products primarily to
industry, construction, agriculture and food-processing sectors. More than
half of the output of the Complex is expected to be absorbed by the South
region by 1985. The Project would create 1,400 jobs directly and indirectly
create up to 15,000 jobs in the second and in the more labor-intensive third
generation industries.
1.03      By financing the Project, the Bank would also encourage the private
sponsors of the downstream units to start implementing their projects which
are on a later schedule. It would substantially reduce the main risk - un-
certainty about timely availability of COPESUL's products - perceived by
them for the successful implementation of the entire complex.
1.04      The implementation of the Complex is in line with Government poli-
cies of (i) decentralizing industry away from the congested Center-South re-
gion while promoting regional development, and (ii) improving the country's
long-term balance of payments prospects through large-scale import substi-
tution in a number of key industries. The country will attain approximate
self-sufficiency in most petrochemicals with the Third Complex which, at
full operation, is expected to produce net foreign exchange savings of about
US$510 million per year (1977 prices), or about 12% of Brazil's projected
current account deficit by 1985.
1.05      The Project was identified in January 1977, and appraised in
September/October 1977 by Messrs. Don Brown, Jean-Francois Rischard and
Ramon Beteta of the Industrial Projects Department, accompanied by Mr. Jacobo
Stempel of IDB. The market aspects of the Complex were reviewed by a mission
consisting of Messrs. Rischard and Bastl (consultant) in July/August, 1977.

II. THE PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY SECTOR
2.01      Since the Project is the first of its kind to be considered for
financing by the Bank, a brief general discussion on petrochemicals is
presented below before the review of the Brazilian petrochemical sector.
A.   Petrochemical Industry - General Background
2.02      The petrochemical industry includes the basic raw materials, in-
termediates and final products manufactured from crude oil or natural gas
feedstocks. These feedstocks currently account for more than 90% of the
world's output of organic chemicals, against only 50% twenty years ago.
Plastic materials, synthetic fibers and synthetic rubber are the final
products produced in largest volume; industrial chemicals such as methanol,
solvents, carbon black, pesticides, detergents, plasticizers, dyestuffs
and pharmaceutics are produced in smaller volume. (Production of ammonia
and nitrogenous fertilizers is generally considered as a separate industry.)
2.03      Products derived from petrochemical sources are now used to meet
most basic needs--clothing, shelter, transportation, storage and conservation,
medicine and even food--and have often surpassed the amounts of available
natural products. The potential for further penetration by petrochemicals
as substitutes or complements to other products is very large. In many
developing countries, there will be growing pressures to increase the area
of land used for food production rather than to produce raw material crops
such as timber, fibers and drug ingredients. Furthermore, preliminary stud-
ies show that the production of products such as steel, glass, aluminum and
natural products might use as much energy drawn from non-renewable resources
as the production of competing petrochemical products. Based on its increas-
ingly important role, the petrochemical industry is expected to consume 8 to
9% of the world's available oil and gas resources by 1985 against less than
5% in 1970.
2.04      World demand projections for principal petrochemical products are:
a/
World Demand   Projections for Major Petrochemicals
(millions of metric tons)
Year                    Annual
Products                 1975   1980   1985   1990       Growth rate
Plastics                  45.0   73.0  100.0   125.0          7.0%
Man-Made Fibers            8.1   11.2   15.3    20.0          6.2%
Synthetic Rubbers          4.9    6.8    8.7    10.5         5.2%
a/   Excluding USSR, Eastern Europe and People's Republic of China.



-3-
2.05      Just as ammonia is regarded as the major basic raw material for
fertilizer production, ethylene is considered as the most important petro-
chemical building block. During the past fifteen years, world production
of ethylene has increased at an annual rate of 16%, from 3.3 million tpy in
1960 to about 30 million tpy in 1975.   Ethylene is now used to produce 30%
of all petrochemicals. World ethylene demand is conservatively estimated to
grow at an average annual rate of 7 to 8% to about 60 million tons by 1985,
as it further improves its position as the primary raw material for organic
chemicals. To meet this twofold increase, and allowing for plant closures,
about 70 new economic-sized ethylene plants will be required during 1976-
1985.
2.06      Ethylene is made from a variety of petroleum-based feedstocks in-
cluding ethane, propane, refinery gas, naphtha, gas oil, and residual oils.
Preferred feedstocks are ethane and propane, but with growing shortages of
natural gas and rising gas prices, ethylene producers are increasingly turn-
ing to such raw materials as naphtha and gas oil. Naphtha- or gas oil-based
ethylene plants are about 30% more expensive than ethane-based ones for an
equivalent amount of ethylene, but result in additional saleable co-prod-
ucts. The production of these co-products in relation to ethylene depends
on the feedstock and is roughly the following:
Co-Product Yields for Different Feedstocks
(In percent of ethylene produced)
Ethane     Naphtha      Gas Oil
Ethylene                       100         100          100
Propylene                        4          38           54
Butadiene                        2            7          16
Benzene                          1            6          23
Others a/                       24         140          192
a/   Toluene, xylenes, pyrolisis gasoline, etc.
2.07      The production of co-products greatly complicates the production
and pricing economics and policies regarding ethylene, its related hydro-
carbons and other derivatives. In the case of naphtha and gas oil feed, the
quantity and proportions of ethylene and co-products can be furthermore modi-
fied by changing the cracking severity, i.e. the conditions of temperature,
pressure and residence time under which the thermal breakdown of the feed-
stock takes place. Higher severity cracking results in additional ethylene
at the expense of such co-products as BTX (benzene, toluene, xylenes) and
by-product gasoline. This flexibility permits a better adjustment of the
production mix to emerging demand patterns.
2.08      Fibers, synthetic rubber, and plastics are the main users of ethyl-
ene, propylene, butadiene and benzene. In 1974, polyethylene-based plastics
accounted for about 41% of world ethylene consumption, followed by ethylene



- 4 -
oxide (solvents, detergents) and ethylene glycols (intermediate to polyester
fibers and plastics and antifreeze) for about 19%, polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
plastics for about 14%, and styrene (for polystyrene plastics and synthetic
rubber) for about 8%.
2.09      Recent ;-:rld production of plastics is distributed as follows,
showing the predominance of the five major thermoplastics:
World Plastic Production in 1974 - By Weight
Product                          Percent        Raw Material
Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE)                29            Ethylene
High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE)               12            Ethylene
Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)                       27            Ethylene
Polypropylene (PP)                              8            Propylene
Polystyrene (PS)                               14       Ethylene, Benzene
Major Thermoplastics                     90
Nylon, acrylics, polyester, etc.               10            Various
Total Plastics                          100
2.10      Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) can be converted to goods for in-
dustrial, agricultural and consumer uses by all methods suitable for thermo-
plastics, i.e. injection molding, blow molding and extrusion. Major appli-
cations are bags for food, fertilizers, cement, milk and other commodities.
Large and expanding markets exist for canal, reservoir and silo lining, irri-
gation and drainage piping, as well as for mulching, whereby soils are cov-
ered with LDPE film to promote plant growth. Wires and cables, bottles and
household articles are other important products made from LDPE.
2.11      High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is much tougher and harder than
LDPE and is used mainly for industrial packaging (e.g. containers, crates,
bottles), industrial components and parts, heavy duty monofilament yarn and
household supplies. Polypropylene (PP) has about the same characteristics
and applications of HDPE, plus additional uses for heavy duty bags, long
shelf-life food bags, sheets, conduits and parts.
2.12      Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), the second most important thermoplastic,
is also easy to mold and extrude, has a broad range of strength and hardness,
and is used mostly in pipes and fittings, hoses, wire and cable, flooring,
footwear, and other industrial and consumer uses. Polystyrene (PS) is used
for insulation, packaging, construction material, and industrial parts and
appliances. Its monomer, styrene, is also used in the production of various
synthetic rubbers, and mostly styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR). These rubbers
account for 90% of butadiene consumption. About 60% of SBR is used in manu-
facture of tires.



- 5 -
2.13      The petrochemical industry is reaching maturity in many indus-
trialized countries, after a rapid growth during the past two decades.
In developing countries, where most of the potential for increased petro-
chemical production is still untapped, a continued rapid expansion of the
industry is expected. By 1990, developing countries could account for about
one-fourth of the production of ethylene, compared with only 10% in 1975.
2.14      The value added to a barrel of crude oil is seven to eight times
larger as a petrochemical feedstock than as a refined fuel product. Thus
the petrochemical industry is an important key to improving many developing
countries' severely deteriorated balance of payment prospects after the oil
crisis. Development of a petrochemical industry can also have far-reaching
effects on employment, industrial development in related and equipment sup-
plying industries, and local research and engineering capabilities. For
developing countries with small domestic markets, the only economic option
in the petrochemical field is to produce final products such as plastic goods
and synthetic fibers from imported raw materials and intermediates. However,
some larger countries, such as Brazil, with large internal markets for petro-
chemicals, have scope for basic ethylene production with large-scale import
substitution effects. Availability of domestic hydrocarbon resources, though
desirable, is not essential to the economic viability of a petrochemical
complex.
B.   Petrochemical Industry in Brazil
2.15      Industry has played a central role in the rapid growth of the
Brazilian economy in the recent past. During 1967 to 1976, real industrial
output increased at an average annual rate of 12.3%. Its growth dropped to
4% in 1975 due to balance of payments constraints, but recovered in 1976 to
10%. The most dynamic element in Brazil's industrial expansion has been the
production of consumer durables and capital goods, which grew at an annual
rate of 18% between 1967 and 1976. The slowest growing subsector has been
the traditional consumer goods sector. Production of intermediate goods
(chemicals, fertilizers, paper(, rubber, semi-finished metals), which account
for 42% of industrial output, has also increased at a good pace, averaging
12% a year since 1967. Increased production of these intermediate goods
has, however, not kept pace with domestic demand and imports are still sig-
nificant, having reached US$3.4 billion in 1976 (excluding petroleum), or
29% of total imports. There is, therefore, substantial opportunity for
import substitution in this subsector of the industry.
2.16      Within this subsector, the chemical industry has grown at an aver-
age rate of 13.5%, increasing its share of industrial output from 15% in 1967
to about 18% in 1976. This achievement is largely due to the petrochemical
industry which has grown at about 19% annually over the same period.
2.17      The Brazilian petrochemical industry initially evolved around the
PETROBRAS refinery in Cubatao, near Sao Paulo. 1/ The first plant to start
1/   The Brazilian Petrochemical Industry is described in "A Industria
Petroquimica Brasileira 1976" (Project File, reference A).



-6-
operations was a nitrogenous fertilizer plant in 1958 using gases produced
by the refinery. After the refinery was modified to produce ethylene and
propylene, a number of privately sponsored petrochemical plants developed.
The main basis for the Sao Paulo Complex was however the commissioning, in
1972, of the Petroquimica Uniao (of which PETROQUISA is now the majority
shareholder) ethylene cracker with a capacity of about 940,000 tpy or petro-
chemical raw materials and intermediates, of which 310,000 tpy is ethylene.
2.18      By 1976, total investment in the Sao Paulo Complex, including down-
stream plants involving about 50 companies, amounted to some US$2 billion.
Some 35 major products are manufactured at the Complex, for either direct
sales or for conversion into other products at the Complex. These products
include solvents, synthetic rubber, detergents, plastics such as polyethylene
and PVC, and nylon for textiles. Annual foreign exchange savings due to the
Complex amounted to about US$600 million in 1976. Nevertheless, the Sao
Paulo petrochemical output is still far short of national demand and Brazil's
petrochemical imports in 1976 totalled US$1.1 billion (or about 8% of total
imports). In the early seventies, the Government developed plans for addi-
tional petrochemical capacity aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in most
petrochemicals by the early 1980s.
2.19      After some consideration of expansion of the Sao Paulo Complex,
the Government decided to build a Second Complex in the State of Bahia, to
(i) decentralize industry away from the congested Sao Paulo area, (ii) foster
regional development; and (iii) encourage competition in the petrochemical
industry. It also represented the first effort by Brazil to obtain all
the advantages of economies of scale in petrochemical production, through
an integrated economic-sized complex planned in advance.
2.20      The Second -- or so-called Bahia -- Complex comprises 30 projects
under construction or recently completed, and is expected to come on stream
fully in mid- to late 1978. The raw materials plant (COPENE) will primarily
use naphtha and gas oil from a nearby PETROBRAS refinery. Its total capacity
will be about 900,000 tpy, out of which 385,000 tpy is ethylene. Invest-
ments in the complex will total about US$2.7 billion.
2.21      The Bahia Complex, following the Government's new investment policies
in the petrochemical sector, incorporates a tripartite ownership scheme, where-
by the raw materials center, COPENE, is fully owned by state-owned enterprises
(with PETROQUISA as the majority shareholder), while the equity of the down-
stream companies is divided between private Brazilian enterprises, PETROQUISA
representing State enterprise, and private foreign capital, which usually
provides the know-how. This system is designed to maintain Brazilian Govern-
ment influence over the overall project, while insuring that the capital
of the downstream units is not only under Brazilian, but also under private
control, so as to stimulate capital inflows and technology transfer.
2.22      In the development of the petrochemical industry in Brazil, there
has also been a gradual change in the strategy used to acquire technology.
Whereas in the First Complex in Sao-Paulo, many firms acquired know-how



-7-
through the payment of royalties for an indefinite period, almost all the
firms involved in the Bahia Complex are paying for technology over periods
generally not exceeding five years, and thus acquiring it in perpetuity;
furthermore most firms supplying the technology are participating as share-
holders. New policies stressing the full absorption of technology by the
Brazilian engineering and equipment building industries, with the objective
of transferring it in turn, will be applied to the Third Complex described
below.
C.   Bank Group Involvement in the Petrochemical Sector
2.23      The core of the Third Petrochemical Complex -- the COPESUL Raw
Materials and Utilities Plant -- would be financed by the proposed loan and
represents the first involvement of the Bank in this sector. However, IFC has
had substantial experience in the Brazilian petrochemical sector, extending
over more than ten years. Its investments include Petroquimica Uniao (138
BR), Poliolefinas (162 BR), Oxiteno (190 BR) and Capuava Carbonos Industrias
(294 BR) in the Sao Paulo petrochemical Complex and Oxiteno Nordeste (314
BR) in the Bahia Complex. In the Third Complex, IFC's efforts are being
directed to assure adequate off-take capacity to coincide with COPESUL's
commissioning. IFC has met with the sponsors of every major second genera-
tion unit (para 5.18). Its proposal for an investment in the POLIOLEFINAS
downstream project (para 5.19) may be presented to the Executive Directors
at about the same time as the proposed Bank loan. Active discussions are
being held with the sponsors of two of the next most advanced downstream
units, with a view to possible IFC investments in early FY79 (paras 5.22 and
5.23). Because of their importance to COPESUL and to the Complex, the Bank
and IFC are collaborating closely to help timely start-up of the downstream
units. The Bank has also been asked to consider a second petrochemical loan
to assist in covering gaps that are expected to remain in the financing of the
foreign exchange costs of the remaining units.
III. THE RIO GRANDE DO SUL PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX
A.   History and Scope
3.01      In 1975, the Government decided that capacity for petrochemicals
should be further expanded through a Third Complex in the State of Rio Grande
do Sul, in line with the above-outlined policies of seeking petrochemical
self-sufficiency by the early 1980s, promoting regional development and de-
centralizing industry. Annex 3 describes the main components of the Complex.
3.02      Compared with the Bahia Complex, the Third Complex has a larger
capacity but fewer downstream units. Its core consists of the COPESUL Raw
Materials and Utilities Plant (the Project), which will primarily produce
some 0.8 million tons per year of basic raw materials such as ethylene,
propylene, butadiene and benzene for supply, along with steam and other



- 8 -
utilities to at least seven downstream (or "second generation") units which
are to produce low-density polyethylene (LDPE); high-density polyethylene
(HDPE); polyvinyl-chloride (PVC); polypropylene (PP); styrene and poly-
styrene (PS) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR). These products will then
in turn serve as input materials in so-called transformation (or "third
generation") industries manufacturing a wide variety of products such as
bags, containers, bottles, construction materials, film, sheet, industrial
parts, household articles, automotive parts, footwear, etc. The inter-
relationship between the core unit (the Project) and the second and third
generation plants as well as their capacities and principal products are
shown on the following page.
3.03      While the third generation plants can, in principle, be located
away from the second generation plants due to ease of transportation of
plastics, the core unit and the second generation plants must be physically
close to each other.  This is because the main output of the core unit, such
as COPESUL's ethylene and propylene, are gases that cannot economically be
shipped over long distances.  Moreover the production of the core unit must
be fully coordinated with that of the downstream units, since its output
has no alternative uses and cannot be stored in any significant quantities.
Hence, the market, production and other aspects of the proposed Project must
be viewed together with those of the downstream units.
3.04      Government, i.e. Conselho de Desenvolvimento Industrial (CDI)
approval has been granted for the COPESUL core plant and for the seven units
depicted in the graph below. Three other smaller projects (acrylates, poly-
alcohols and specialty rubber) are under consideration, and other downstream
and transformation units will be added over time. The COPESUL plant has the
flexibility of changing the mix of petrochemical raw materials produced to
provide for a wide range of requirements of the downstream units (para 6.03).
All except one of the main (seven) downstream units are planned to begin
operations at the same time as COPESUL in early 1982, or during 1982 (para
5.26).
B.   Location
3.05      The Complex will be located in a new industrial estate of 13,000
hectares, about 30 km from Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul (IBRD Map 13334)
and 25 km from the PETROBRAS REFAP refinery; the Complex could not be located
closer to the refinery due to the non-availability of land. COPESUL and the
second generation plants will initially occupy 1,800 hectares; the remainder
of the site will host third generation and related industries as they develop.
The site is close to important highways and is bounded by two railway lines
(EF-290 and EF-116), the Cai River (which flows into the nearby Jacui River)
and main power transmission lines. At full capacity operation, the power
needs of the Complex will amount to 130 MW, or about 10% of the load pro-
jected for the State of Rio Grande do Sul in 1981. Coal for utilities is
available from nearby fields. The site thus has a good access to rail, road
and river transportation, as well as water, coal and power supply.

3.06      As with the Bahia Complex (para 2.19), there has been some debate
around the Government's decision on the location of the Third Complex, specifi-
cally as to whether an expansion of the Sao Paulo Complex would not be a more
economical solution than the construction of a grass roots complex in the
South. The Sao Paulo location would, a priori, imply lower direct capital
expenditures but would most likely result in higher overall costs if all
infrastructure and social costs associated with locating the complex in the
Sao Paulo area, with the already overtaxed infrastructure, severe congestion
and pollution problems, were allocated to the costs of the complex. 1/ Fur-
thermore, an analysis of transportation costs undertaken by IDB 2/ shows that
the final prices of products from the Third Complex delivered in the Sao Paulo
area will be substantially the same as if it had been located near Sao Paulo.
The Government's decision to locate the Third Complex at the proposed site
appears reasonable and justified.
IV. MARKET AND MARKETING
A.  Historical Petrochemical Market Development
4.01      The following table summarizes data in Annex 4-1 for the major
petrochemical raw material, ethylene, and for the five major thermoplastics
(low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride,
polystyrene and polypropylene) and SBR, which together account for more than
85% of ethylene consumption in Brazil:
11 Congestion and public services such as roads, transportation, water and
sewerage systems and pollution control are serious problems in Sao Paulo.
The Bank is currently considering a sewage treatment and industrial pol-
lution control project for Sao Paulo.

such is not traded in any significant amount (para 3.03).
4.02      Despite a slower growth rate since 1973, the Brazilian consumption
of petrochemicals has grown at a quick pace compared to developed countries
(in part due to a smaller starting base). Demand for ethylene-based products
was primarily met by imports (about 90% in 1971) until the commissioning of
the Sao Paulo ethylene plant in 1972 (para 2.17). Since then, an average of
about 36% of ethylene-based petrochemicals consumed (expressed in ethylene
content) have been imported. The import ratio is 60%, 46%, 51% and 69% for
propylene, butadiene, benzene and xylene-based products respectively. The
total import bill for petrochemicals has, however, kept growing, adding to
the large cost of imported oil (US$3.2 billion in 1976) since the sharp in-
crease in oil prices in 1973 and 1974.

4.03      Despite substantial and growing imports of petrochemicals, the
petrochemical transformation industry (primarily thermoplastics) currently
shows average capacity utilization rates of only 60-65%. The Bank's review
of this industry 1/ shows that this is partly the result of a pause in the
growth of demand following measures taken by the Government during 1975/76
to restrain aggregate demand in the economy. More important, though, is
the chronic repressed demand effect resulting from constant shortages of
locally produced petrochemicals and from Government efforts to discourage
imports. Imports are penalized, through high tariffs and a costly import
deposit system 2/ raising the cost of some imported petrochemicals up to
150-200% of international prices. The net result is that transformation
industries cannot afford to pay for these imports and are forced to operate
below optimum levels even though the market would justify higher production,
thus leaving an element of latent demand unsatisfied.
4.04      The following table summarizes the Bank's estimate of end-use pat-
tern of the five major thermoplastics in 1976:
1/   Brazil - Review of the Petrochemical Industry, Sept. 1977, E. Bastl,
Consultant (Project File, reference C). The remainder of this section
is based on data contained in this document.
2/   Briefly, the import deposit system requires a one year cash deposit for
100% of import value with no interest and monetary correction and the
effects of the deposit system are excluded from any price increase
permitted by the Interministerial Price Council (CIP).

4.05      The two dominant plastics are low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which account together for about two-thirds of the
total. The consumption levels of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and poly-
styrene (PS) are much smaller due to their more limited range of applications.
The consumption of polypropylene (PP) is still low due to the absence of domes-
tic production.
4.06      Although the five major thermoplastics cover most of the range
of usual applications (paras 2.10 to 2.12) in Brazil, their use is still
heavily concentrated in packaging (41%) and construction (19%), reflecting
the relatively early stage of development of the market. Packaging appli-
cations include a large variety of bags, used primarily for the conserva-
tion and transportation of grain, sugar, meat, milk, processed food, fer-
tilizers, asbestos, cement and other materials, besides commercial packaging,
and containers, crates and bottles. With long distances to markets and the
variety of food production and processing activities in Brazil, the various
forms of plastic packaging, with their versatility of shape and resistance,
light weight and good conservation properties, find large outlets, despite
the competition of often lower-priced paper and natural fiber bags or wood
containers. The recurrent shortage of glass bottles and jars has also been
an important factor. Virtually all the plastic applications listed under
construction are in pipes and fittings for water, sewerage, agricultural
irrigation and drainage, and electrical conduits. These products are gen-
erally manufactured (mostly from PVC) by larger, more sophisticated plants
than is the case for most packaging goods.
4.07      Applications in agriculture (besides pipes and bags) are at the
early stage of their development and comprise films and sheets for silo, canal
and reservoir lining, and storage. The main industrial applications are in



- 14 -
wires and cables, electrical and industrial parts, housings and boxes, as well
as sheet and film for various uses. Automotive uses include battery casings
and engine and body parts. Household and other applications include upholstery,
carpeting, appliances and housewares, and luggage. Brazil's large production
of footwear also creates a good market for soles and heels, primarily from PVC.
Most of the applications in which plastics are supplementing other materials,
like paper and leather, are considered technically necessary and economically
justified.
4.08      The usage pattern for SBR in Brazil is similar to that of other
countries with tires accounting for about two-thirds of consumption. The
average SBR content of tires in Brazil is still somewhat higher than in Europe
and the U.S. Major non-tire uses are conveyor belts and parts for automobiles.
B.   Projected Petrochemical Demand
4.09      The market for petrochemicals is difficult to assess due to the mul-
tiplicity of products and factors affecting their demand. To overcome this
difficulty, it is common to forecast future demand for groups of petrochemi-
cals, such as thermoplastics and synthetic rubber, generally through statis-
tical (econometric) models linking their per capita consumption to per capita
income or other key macro variables, and then to estimate derived demand either
for a few basic raw materials or generally only for ethylene. Because such
models rely on only one or a few explanatory variables and assume a contin-
uation of relationships observed in the past, they can provide only prelimi-
nary benchmarks. The Bank's most likely forecast is, therefore, derived from
a product-by-product analysis of the Brazilian end-use markets for thermoplas-
tics and SBR, based on numerous field interviews (Project File, reference C).
In addition, to test the adequacy of the timing of the Third Complex under
adverse conditions, the Bank also developed a worst case forecast based on
international petrochemical consumption data in the period immediately fol-
lowing the oil crisis.
4.10      The Bank's most likely market forecast for the five major thermo-
plastics on the basis of the product-by-product end-use analysis is given
below:

1982-85 (projected)(
a/   The Bank's field review covers the period 1976-82 and pro-
jections for 1985 assume the continuation of the growth
rate projected for that period. After commissioning of
the Third Complex in 1982, average plastic prices will
drop as local production replaces penalized imports and,
as a result, demand is expected to grow faster than in
the preceding period; the above extrapolation is therefore
judged conservative.
4.11      The overall annual growth rate for thermoplastics demand for the
period 1976-82 is estimated at 13%. Amongst the individual thermoplastics
polypropylene, as a versatile and cost-effective material, is expected to
continue to be the fastest growing thermoplastic (22% annual growth) in all
major end-use categories. Its price performance advantage in the packaging
field as woven or non-woven bags will enable it to score gains over the other
plastics, primarily LDPE and increase its share of total plastics market from
about 8% in 1976 to about 13% in 1982. The second fastest growing plastic,
HDPE, (17.5% annual growth) is expected to make strong advances mainly in the
construction sector in the form of easily installed, flexible large diameter
pipes for sewerage and other uses. HDPE will also increasingly be used for
automobile parts and, as a result, account for 14% of total plastics consump-
tion in 1982. Polypropylene and HDPE are thus expected to account for more
than one-fourth of thermoplastics consumption by 1982, against about one-fifth
at present. The share of polystyrene (growing at 13.1% annually) is expected
to remain at about its present level (13%).
4.12      Despite slower than average growth, LDPE and PVC will still hold
about 60% of the thermoplastics market by 1982, against two-thirds in 1976.
LDPE's overall growth of 10.6% annually is likely to be achieved, despite



- 16 -
strong competition from polypropylene in bags, through increased applica-
tion in agriculture, including irrigation and storage. It should also in-
crease its share in the container field where it can be mixed with HDPE to
produce less costly crates and boxes. PVC is expected to grow somewhat
faster (11.4% annually), mainly as piping material in construction and water
supply.
4.13      The table below gives a breakdown of projected demand of these
major thermoplastics by major end-uses in 1982. Packaging goods (39% of
total consumption of thermoplastics) and construction materials (22%) are
expected to remain the two largest end-uses of plastics, followed by house--
hold articles (15%) and industrial applications (8%):

4.14      Compared to thermoplastics, demand for SBR, the only other major
ethylene consumer, is expected to grow at a slower rate. It is estimated
that SBR consumption will grow by about 8% annually during 1976-82, against
18% annually over the last decade, due to a gradual reduction in the average
SBR content of tires and slower growth of automobile production. Total SBR
consumption should increase from 130,000 tons in 1976, to 215,000 tons in 1982
and 260,000 tons in 1985.
4.15      This SBR demand growth when combined with the forecast thermoplas-
tics demand, results in a derived ethylene demand of about 1.2 million tons
in 1982 and 1.8 million tons in 1985 or an average annual growth of 13.4%.
This rate is close to the rate of growth projected for the 1977-85 period by



- 17 -
an econometric model developed by IDB. 1/ Therefore, the above projections
are considered acceptable as a most likely forecast of derived ethylene
demand, to be used in assessing the timing of the Complex (para 4.17).
4.16      However, to determine the sensitivity of the timing of the proposed
Complex to the demand estimates, a "worst case" forecast has been developed
to analyze the implications of a continuation of (or later relapse into)
the more sluggish consumption trend observed in most countries in the years
immediately following the oil crisis. The "worst case" forecast is based on
an econometric model that links per capita thermoplastic consumption and
income data based on observation in 40 countries during 1974, 1975 and 1976
only, a period when thermoplastic consumption growth suddenly slowed down due
to the effects of the oil crisis and the general recession which followed.
As such, it is an intentionally pessimistic forecast; one of its main fea-
tures is its weak exponential growth, which means that its variance with
regard to the best estimate forecast becomes greater in the later years,
as shown below. 2/

plans of the three petrochemical complexes. The demand for ethylene would

- 18 -
exceed domestic supply by about 645,000 tons if the most likely market fore-
cast were to materialize and if the Third Complex reaches full capacity pro-
duction in 1985 as planned. In this most likely case, there would also be
no need for exporting ethylene-based products from Brazil in any significant
amount. However, if the "worst case" forecast were to apply, a maximum tem-
porary surplus of about 100,000 tons of ethylene-based products (expressed
in ethylene content) would emerge in 1983 (10% of national capacity), with
the surplus disappearing after 1985. Even if this situation were to develop,
which is unlikely, it should not pose a serious problem, in view of the pos-
sibility of exporting part of the Brazilian thermoplastics production (para
4.19). Therefore, timing of the Third Complex appears acceptable from the
market point of view. However, the above analysis indicates a balanced de-
mand supply situation in the mid-1980's if the demand develops slower than
projected and therefore the need for the Brazilian Government to make a more
detailed market assessment before approving further investments in petrochemi-
cals for the next decade. The petrochemical market and pricing study which
is proposed below (para 4.23) should place a strong emphasis on this issue,
particularly because the Bank and IDB demand forecasts are substantially lower
than current Government forecasts (see Annex 4-2).
4.18      Although the above aggregate ethylene demand and supply balance
analysis shows that the timing of the Complex is adequate overall, Bank staff
have also analyzed the market situation at the level of each downstream unit
(and product) included in the Complex. Annex 4-3 contains detailed projec-
tions of demand and supply for each thermoplastic and SBR, which are sum-
marized below.

4.19      The surplus shown for polystyrene is based on the assumption that
all the trains of the polystyrene plant envisaged for the Third Complex would
be built together with the other downstream plants. It is, however, likely
that one train will be commissioned first and that the others will follow
over time as demand builds up (para 5.25). (This does not affect the sched-
ule of the styrene unit itself, which is also expected to produce propylene
oxide and glycols.) The surplus shown above for SBR could also be reduced
if one of the existing units, COPERBO, indeed phases down, as currently en-
visaged, its operation by 20,000 to 30,000 tpy. Temporary surpluses might



- 19 -
also be possible for LDPE, mainly in the second year of operation (i.e.
1983). But this small surplus should not pose any serious problem, since
it is likely that Brazil will continue to export part of its LDPE produc-
tion to non-producing Latin American countries.
D.   Regional Market
4.20      The South region (Rio Grande do Sul - the state in which the Project
is located - Parana, Santa Catarina) accounts for only 7% of Brazil's total
area, 18% of its population and national income, but for a much more substan-
tial part of its total agricultural and livestock output. A large number of
food processing, fertilizers and other agricultural input production activi-
ties are located in the region. As a consequence, there is a large potential
for plastic applications mainly as film and sheet for packaging, and various
agricultural uses. Construction, another important plastics market, has grown
faster in the South than the national average, and so has the market for pipes
and fittings, wires and cables, and other construction materials. Brazil's
largest maker of PVC pipes is located in the region. A growing share of the
national production of tires, footwear, appliances, and various other indus-
trial goods using plastic and rubber materials, also originates in the South.
As a result, the regional demand for plastics and rubber has historically
grown faster than the Brazilian average. Production of the local transfor-
mation industry, which now accounts for about 20% of the country's thermo-
plastic production, has grown 36% a year on average from 1970 to 1975. The
growth of the regional thermoplastics market is expected to continue in the
future, as most consuming sectors continue to expand, albeit at a lower rate
than in the preceding period. The consumption of thermoplastics in the region
is conservatively forecast to grow from the estimated 130,000 tons in 1976 to
between 370,000 and 450,000 tpy in 1985, which represents between 57% and 70%
of the capacity of the six downstream thermoplastics units in the Third
Complex. Most of the remaining production is likely to be sold in the Sao
Paulo area, which will continue to remain deficit in thermoplastics supply.
The Third Complex is not expected to face any major disadvantage compared to
the Sao Paulo Complex in this market, due to the relatively low transportation
cost of the plastics (para 3.06).
4.21      The market for the downstream units depends, in addition to the
overall demand and supply considerations mentioned above, on the ability of
the local transformation industry to install sufficient production capacity
to match the production of the Complex.  This offtake is greatly facilitated
if a substantial share of the consuming transformation industries is located
near a petrochemical complex. A number of factors indicate that due to its
location, the Third Complex is in a relatively enviable position with re-
gard to the transformation industries, particularly in comparison with the
Bahia Complex in the North-Eastern region. The transformation industry in
the South has already had a remarkable growth record since 1970 (para 4.20),
despite the absence of local raw materials, and under a sales tax system
that favors its Sao Paulo competitors. With the availability of in-State
raw material supply after the commissioning of the Complex, local trans-
formers would no longer face this disadvantage. With more than half of its



- 20 -
thermoplastic output likely to be absorbed by the local market by 1985, the
local transformation industry, which is backed by dynamic local and partly
foreign entrepreneurship and has access to financing from local groups and
regional banks, should quickly expand around or nearby the Complex. These
developments will be facilitated by a manpower training program sponsored by
the National Vocational Institute, the local industry, and the Rio Grande
do Sul State, and the earmarking of a large part of the industrial estate
surrounding the Complex for transformation units (para. 3.05).
E.   Pricing Policy in the Petrochemical Sector
4.22      The present Government pricing policy for the petrochemical in-
dustry, like in most other basic industries, is to limit prices to a level
which will allow efficient producers a 23.8% before tax (equivalent to about
16% after tax) return on investment. The price ceiling is initially set by
the Interministerial Price Council (CIP) for each individual producer after
carefully reviewing their cost structures, at 80% capacity utilization rate.
These prices are readjusted as the producer stabilizes operations above 80%
utilization factor, to provide the above return at the new lower cost struc-
ture. This policy, which is currently applicable to both raw material and
downstream products, can result in different prices being allowed for the
same product to producers with different cost structures. The prices paid
by different consumers are generally roughly equalized through a physical
allocation process, under which each major consumer takes an agreed propor-
tion of its needs from producers with different prices.
4.23      This policy is adequate in the present situation where only one
petrochemical complex is in operation, and where the demand for petrochemi-
cals by far outstrips the domestic supply capabilities. With the commission-
ing of the Bahia Complex in mid-1978 and later of the Third Complex some four
years later, both of which would have capital costs much higher than the ex-
isting Sao Paulo Complex, the entire petrochemical pricing philosophy will
however have to be rethought. 1/ Since similar issues arise in other sub-sec-
tors of the industry, the Government, which is aware of the importance and
complexity of the problem, intends to undertake a general review of its in-
dustrial pricing policies. Pending the completion of such review, whose
timing and duration is still largely undetermined, the Bank has obtained the
following assurances from the Government: (i) a special study of the petro-
chemical pricing policies will be undertaken and following the recommenda-
tion made above (para 4.17), the related issue of market development will
be included in the scope of the study; and (ii) the Bank will be furnished
with the results of the study, which would be completed by December 1979,
and will be able to comment on its terms of reference and recommendations.
F.   Marketing of Project Output and Timely Completion of Downstream Projects
4.24      The major raw materials to be produced by COPESUL, ethylene and
propylene, are gases which are not usable as such and cannot be economically
transported over long distances. COPESUL will, therefore, be dependent on
1/   This issue is further discussed under paras 8.03 and 8.04 in connection
with the price assumptions for the financial analysis of the Project.



- 21 -
the downstream units (paras 3.03 and 3.04) for its sales. Ideally, to mini-
mize its market risk, COPESUL should sign firm offtake and supply contracts
with the already approved downstream projects, whose total ethylene require-
ments amount to more than 95% of COPESUL's ethylene output (para 8.02). But,
due to the shorter construction schedule of most downstream projects (para
5.26) most of tlvv2 projects are not as far advanced as the COPESUL Project.
Also, because of the difficulty of determining long-range prices at this
stage (para 4.23), it is unreasonable to expect that COPESUL and the down-
stream units could agree on the prices to be used in such contracts until
sometime before the beginning of commercial operations. However, it is pos-
sible to secure offtake and supply agreements, as letters of intent, at this
stage and COPESUL has been asked to obtain, and has obtained, letters of in-
tent, satisfactory to the Bank, from the sponsors of the downstream projects
expressing their intentions to take agreed quantities of COPESUL products on
a mutually agreed time schedule.
4.25      The above expressions of intent on offtake and supply by themselves
would not give a sufficient assurance on COPESUL sales unless satisfactory
assurances regarding the timely implementation of the downstream units are
also forthcoming. in this respect, the commitments entered into by the down-
stream project sponsors in securing the CDI approval (para 3.04) are not suf-
ficient either, since the only penalty for not fulfilling their obligations
is a loss of the investment incentives (primarily custom duty exemption on
imported equipment) granted by CDI. COPESUL has therefore drafted a Technical
Cooperation and Financial Agreement between itself, the downstream companies,
and the main sponsors of the Complex (paras 5.02 to 5.12) which confirms each
entity's role and commitment to the timely and successful implementation of
the Rio Grande do Sul Complex. This Agreement was signed by all the parties
on December 18, 1977 (Project File, Reference E). It contains in particular
a generally worded commitment by the sponsors of the downstream companies
to implement their projects according to a schedule compatible with COPESUL's,
and to exchange information and consult with the latter about the progress
of their respective projects. Both so as to substantiate this commitment
and to provide for better monitoring of the progress of the downstream proj-
ects, the above letters of intent also contain, besides the intended schedule
and build-up of raw material offtake by each downstream project, a detailed
timetable of the steps to be taken in implementing each project, including
those related to the securing of financing and the finalization of the cor-
porate structure.
4.26      COPESUL has transmitted the above letters of intent, along with
their attached time schedules, to the Bank, and has agreed to keep the Bank
informed about the progress of the downstream projects in addition to its
normal project reporting requirements (para 8.16). In case it became apparent
that the sponsors of one of the approved downstream projects are unable to
implement their project in accordance with the envisaged time schedule, the
following agreements have been reached during negotiations: (i) PETROQUISA
(paras 5.04 to 5.07) and FIBASE (paras 5.09 and 5.10), two of the main sponsors
and promoters of the Complex, will make adequate arrangements to ensure that the
construction of such project is carried out on a time schedule satisfactory



- 22 -
to the Bank; and (ii) the Government will not only guarantee the performance
of PETROQUISA's and FIBASE's obligation, but will also take on its own behalf
appropriate actions to ensure that the construction of the downstream projects
approved by CDI (para 3.04) is carried out in accordance with the deadline
accepted by their sponsors for purposes of obtaining the CDI approval.
4.27      Based on the above-mentioned letters of intent and agreements
reached, and with the agreements and arrangements regarding the financing
of the downstream projects and the coordination of their implementation men-
tioned in Chapter V, it is believed that satisfactory assurances have been
obtained with respect to the marketing of Project output.
V. SPONSORS OF THE COMPLEX AND OF THE COMPANY (COPESUL)
5.01      This chapter describes the sponsorship of the Complex and of COPESUL,
the Company that is to execute the Project for which Bank financing is pro-
posed. It also briefly describes the extent of the financial obligations
which the principal sponsors will have in helping to finance the Complex
relative to their other financial obligations. The already approved down-
stream projects are then described in some detail, aLong with their tentative
financing plans. Finally, at the end of the Chapter, the coordination of the
implementation of the various parts of the Complex is discussed.
A.   The Main Sponsors of the Complex
5.02      The general ownership scheme of the Third Complex follows the tri-
partite model implemented in the Second (Bahia) Complex (para 2.21). The
COPESUL core plant will be owned by the Government through PETROQUISA (51%
of equity) and BNDE's equity arm FIBASE (49%), and most of its debt financ-
ing will come from BNDE (paras 5.13 and 7.03). The control of the downstream
units will as a rule be both privately and Brazilian held, with foreign
minority partners usually providing the know-how. To make this possible, BNDE
will debt-finance 60% of the cost of each downstream project (unless other
lenders are present, in which case this percentage would decrease accordingly)
and, through purchases of non-voting shares through its subsidiary FIBASE,
help Brazilian private investors, including local Southern groups, participate
in or control the downstream units. Based on this outline, the tentative
financing plan for the Complex can be summarized as follows:

a/   This table summarizes the financing plan of COPESUL, described in detail
in Chapter VII, and the provisional financing plans of the downstream
projects, which are described in more detail in paras 5.17 to 5.25.
Due to their early stage, the downstream projects' financing plans are
still tentative and are those drawn up as of the end of 1977 (para 5.18).
5.03      BNDE (and its subsidiary FIBASE) is thus the primary financier of
the Complex. Together they will provide about 45% of the estimated US$1.4
billion total financing required (in constant 1977 dollars) 1/ for the Com-
plex. 2/ Against this, PETROQUISA will only provide about 13% overall, with
more than three-fourths of its total contribution representing its participa-
tion in COPESUL's equity.
1/   Except as otherwise indicated, all figures in this chapter are in constant
1977 US dollars and thus exclude price escalation. As a rough order of
magnitude, current dollar figures are expected to be 20% higher.
2/   This amount does not include the PETROBRAS refinery expansion (para
6.05) which will cost about US$370 million in constant 1977 dollars,
nor the cost of infrastructure for the Complex and the industrial estate
surrounding it estimated at US$250 million in constant 1977 dollars
(para 6.08).



- 24 -
5.04      PETROQUISA (and its subsidiary COPESUL) is however the primary pro-
moter of the Complex from the standpoint of providing management, technical
expertise and coordination of the many aspects critical in organizing and
implementing such a large facility. A wholly-owned subsidiary of the state
oil company PETROBRAS, PETROQUISA was created in 1967 to supply the petro-
chemical industry in Brazil with basic petrochemical materials at competitive
prices. It establishes or participates in large-scale petrochemical (and
ammonia) plants in association with private and other public sector investors,
and currently operates through a group of 25 firms which include eight sub-
sidiary firms in which it is a majority shareholder and 17 associated firms
in which it has minority interest.
5.05      Historical financial statements of PETROQUISA are shown in Annex 5-1.
Its total assets increased by 60% between 1974-76 and amounted to US$356 mil-
lion equivalent on December 31, 1976. The main assets include investments
in subsidiaries and affiliates, which represented 51% of total assets at the
end of 1976, and the fixed assets of its own plants (19% of the total). The
bulk of the funds to finance this expansion of fixed assets came from capital
stock from PETROBRAS and from loans obtained from BNDE and a foreign bank.
The company's net profit rose from zero in 1974 to US$28 million in 1976,
almost entirely due to a ninefold increase in dividends received from sub-
sidiary companies. PETROQUISA's 1976 sales were US$155 million equivalent
and its 1977 total investment budget was US$73 million.
5.06      PETROQUISA will participate in the Rio Grande do Sul Petrochemical
Complex both as the majority shareholder of COPESUL and as a residual, and in
any case minority, shareholder in some of the downstream units, and its
total contribution to the Complex (all as equity) is estimated at about US$185
million (in constant 1977 dollars). The level of PETROQUISA's financial
participation in the downstream units, however, is still tentative, although
the congressional approvals required before it is allowed to have an equity
participation in the predominantly privately held units have been granted in
December 1977.
5.07      PETROQUISA's corporate policy is to become a holding company and in.
the long term to retain control only over such raw material units as COPESUL.
Following this policy, during 1977, PETROQUISA divested itself of its fertil-
izer operations. Once PETROQUISA operates only as a holding company, its
profits will be derived exclusively from dividends. PETROQUISA's projected
sources of funds (mostly consisting of internally generated cash) for 1977-81,
show that its financial position is sound, and that it should have no signifi-
cant problem in meeting its financial disbursements for the Complex, whose
relative importance within PETROQUISA overall investment budget is shown
below:

of its fertilizer companies.
b/   In 1980 and 1981, the COPESUL project is the only major capital project
currently planned by PETROQUISA, besides its limited participation in
some of the downstream units of the Third Complex.
5.08      BNDE (Banc. Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico) was created in
1952 as a federal agency to develop key economic sectors. BNDE has since
become one of the Government's most important agency for assisting industrial
development. In 1971, it was transformed into a government-owned public en-
terprise, having been granted greater financial and administrative autonomy.
BNDE's resources as of December 31, 1976 consisted primarily of its equity of
US$2.5 billion equivalent, domestic borrowings of US$4.6 billion, and foreign
borrowings of US$700 million. The two national social funds, the Program for
Social Integration (PIS) and the Program for Creation of Public Servants'
Patrimony (PASEP), which BNDE has administered for the Government since 1973,
have been, and will continue to be, the mainstay of BNDE's resoures. BNDE
forecasts that receipts from these sources will increase to around US$1.5
billion equivalent annually by 1979. BNDE funds also include annual Govern-
ment budgetary grants, which eventually are incorporated into its capital.
BNDE foresees no problem in meeting its financial commitments for the Com-
plex (totalling about US$490 million), since its yearly disbursements for
the Complex are not expected to exceed 3% of its forecasted yearly invest-
ment budgets as indicated in the following table:

- 26 -
5.09      BNDE will also participate in the financing of the Complex through
its subsidiary FIBASE (Insumos Basicos S.A. Financiamento e Participacoes)
as minority shareholder (49%) of COPESUL and in some downstream projects.
FIBASE's total investment in the Rio Grande do Sul Complex, including its
equity participation in COPESUL is estimated at about US$150 million,
thereby increasing BNDE's total participation in the Complex to US$640
million in constant 1977 dollars (para 5.08). FIBASE was created in 1974
to provide equity financing for medium to large Brazilian industrial enter-
prises -- a type of financing which is difficult to obtain in Brazil. FIBASE
will act primarily as a promoter of local equity financing for the Third Com-
plex, by setting up joint ventures with private investors. In this role,
FIBASE's basic function will be to cover part of the local equity financing
which is not available from private sources, including local Southern groups,
through the purchase of non-voting shares (para 5.02). FIBASE plans to later
sell its shares to private Brazilian investors as private investment funds
become available.
5.10      FIBASE is currently a shareholder in 38 firms, including COPESUL.
The funds available to FIBASE have come almost entirely from BNDE, primarily
as capital contributions and to a lesser extent as loans. FIBASE's histori-
cal financial statements are presented in Annex 5-2. Financial projections
prepared by FIBASE for 1977-79 indicate that the principal source of ftmds
will continue to be capital contributions from BNDE and that the financial
position of the company will remain sound. FIBASE should have no problem
in meeting its financial disbursements for the Complex since they are well
within its investment budget, as shown below, and are covered by BNDE's total
budget (para. 5.08).

since FIBASE had no budget forecasts beyond 1979 as of the time of
appraisal.
5.11      The infrastructure for the Complex (paras 6.08) and for the surround-
ing industrial estate will be implemented under the responsibility of CONPETRO,
an agency of the Rio Grande do Sul State. Its investment budget amounts to
about US$250 million in constant 1977 dollars and will be financed for 20% by



- 27 -
the National Housing Bank (BNH), for 30% through the National Plan for
Sanitation (PLANASA) in conjunction with the State agency in charge of
sanitation (CORSAN), for 35% through the State budget, and for 15% by other,
as yet unidentified, financing sources.
5.12      The Rio Grande do Sul Petrochemical Complex is a large iL^'estment
and can only be successfully implemented with the full financial support of
the above-mentioned Government-owned institutions sponsoring the facility.
Although, as shown above, the Complex's fund requirements are a relatively
small and manageable proportion of the total forecasted investment budgets
of the principal sponsoring institutions, the timely and adequate provision
of funds is critical to the successful implementation of the Complex. The
following agreements have therefore been reached: (i) PETROQUISA and FIBASE
will make adequate arrangements, including the provision of back-up equity
financing, to ensure that the downstream projects will be implemented on a
time schedule satisfactory to the Bank (para 4.26); (ii) BNDE, and PETROBRAS
(as PETROQUISA's main shareholder) will assure the provision of funds to the
downstream projects following their normal financing procedures, and (iii)
the State of Rio Grande do Sul, and the Federal Government, will provide,
or cause to be provided, such funds as are needed to complete the infra-
structure required for the Complex in a timely fashion. These agreements
are in addition to the agreements reached regarding the provision of funds
to the Borrower (COPESUL) by its financial sponsors, and the guaranteeing
of the latters' obligations by the Government or the Guarantor (paras 7.04
and 7.05).
B. Companhia Petroquimica do Sul - COPESUL
5.13      COPESUL, the project sponsor, which will own and operate the
Project, was established on June 8, 1976, with a subscribed capital of
US$810,000 (Cr$10 million) equivalent. The objective of the Company is
to coordinate the development of Rio Grande do Sul Petrochemical Complex,
and specifically to build and operate its Raw Materials and Utilities Plant.
The share capital of COPESUL was subscribed and paid in by PETROQUISA (51%
of equity) and by FIBASE (49% of equity). Since the proposed Project will
be COPESUL's first operation, its equity financing will be entirely provided
in the form of capital contributions to COPESUL by PETROQUISA and FIBASE.
These shareholders will also guarantee all the obligations assumed by COPESUL
(para 8.15).
5.14      COPESUL is administered by a Board of Directors which is elected
by the shareholders. The Board of Directors in turn elects the President
and the Director-Superintendent, who are jointly directly responsible for
the day-to-day operations of COPESUL. COPESUL's organization chart is shown
in Annex 5-3. As of September 1977, COPESUL had a total staff of 170, of
whom 51 were its own regular staff and the rest on assignment from PETROBRAS,
PETROQUISA and COPENE. By early 1978, when project implementation will start
in earnest, COPESUL will increase its staffing to about 275 professional and
administrative staff.



- 28 -
5.15      Brazil's Second Petrochemical Complex was also implemented under
the general sponsorship of PETROQUISA and its main raw material plant is
owned by one of its subsidiaries - COPENE-Petroquimica do Nordeste S.A.
(para 2.21). During the implementation of this complex, PETROQUISA has
developed substantial experience in project management. This valuable expe-
rience will be made fully available to COPESUL. Once COPENE starts commer-
cial operations in mid-1978 (it is expected to be completed generally in
line with its cost and time budgets), PETROQUISA will transfer its project
personnel to COPESUL. With the assurance of this support, COPESUL is consi-
dered capable of satisfactorily managing the implementation of the Project.
5.16      The balance sheet statement of COPESUL as of December 31, 1976
(unaudited) is summarized below:
COPESUL - Balance Sheet at December 31, 1977
(thousands of US dollars equivalent)
ASSETS                                                 LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL
Cash and negotiable securities              3.7    Accounts payable             5.0
Bearer securities and others                0.2    Long-term liabilities        5.1
Land, equipment, etc.                      16.4    Capital                     10.2
Total                           20.3                                 20.3
The principal asset at that time was land acquired for establishment of the
Third Petrochemical Complex. The capital stock was totally subscribed and
paid in.
C.   The Downstream Units
5.17      All downstreams units have prepared feasibility and marketing studies
mostly in collaboration with their technology suppliers as part of the proce-
dure to obtain the required Government (CDI) approvals (paras 3.04 and 4.25).
All units will be based on commercially proven technology and several have
signed agreements to purchase technology. Four of the already approved units
will be using the same technology as the parent companies' other plants in
Brazil. In these cases the technology supplier was selected taking into
consideration the appropriateness of the technology and the experience the
parent company has had with their plants. The other companies selected their
technology from among several international contenders. The selection was
based on the technical and economic evaluations of the technology, product
mix and the Brazilian market. The approach adopted in designing and pro-
moting downstream plants is considered reasonable.
5.18      The tentative financing plans of the downstream projects are sum-
marized in the following table. Each project is expected to be financed 40%
through equity and 60% through debt financing. The main equity contributions



- 29 -
will be made by private Brazilian companies, many of whom already operate
in the same or in a related field, and who are usually the project organizers.
The Government wishes that local Southern groups participate to the largest
possible extent in the equity financing. Both the national and Southern
partners appear keen in principle to move ahead with their investments,
whose rates of rcrz.rn, calculated on the basis of prevailing prices, they
judge attractive. However, in view of the uncertainty surrounding future
pricing policies in the petrochemical subsector (paras 4.22 and 4.23), and
to ensure that private investors will retain their interest in implementing
their respective projects at the earliest, the Government has agreed not to
take any action with respect to product prices which may prevent the down-
stream companies, operating efficiently, from earning a reasonable return on
their investment (para 8.13). Most debt financing for the downstream projects
will be provided by BNDE (paras 5.02, 5.08 and 5.12) and the remainder, which
is mostly in foreign exchange, will be provided by IFC (para 2.23 and paras
5.19, 5.22 and 5.23) and by other lenders, including possibly the Bank
(para 2.23).
5.19      POLIOLEFINAS is a petrochemical company which started producing
LDPE in 1972 in Rio de Janeiro. In 1977 it sold 99,800 tpy of LDPE in
Brazil and exported 6,300 tpy to Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay and Bolivia.
POLIOLEFINAS plans to set up a 115,000 tpy LDPE plant in the Third Complex
as an addition to its existing facilities. The project is estimated to cost
US$90 million (constant 1977 dollars). POLIOLEFINAS's internal cash genera-
tion is sufficient to provide all the equity needed for this project. The
company is however seeking a participation from Southern investors (primarily
the MAGUEFA group) in line with the Government's objective of having local
investors participate in the Complex if possible. One solution being consi-
dered is setting the project up as a subsidiary with MAGUEFA or other local
investors participating in the subsidiary. Debt financing will be provided by
BNDE and possibly by IFC, which is considering loan financing of US$40 million
(in current dollars), of which US$30 million would be sold to participants.
5.20      PETROFLEX, a subsidiary of PETROQUISA, plans to set up a new 80,000
tpy SBR plant in the Complex as a subsidiary of its own. PETROFLEX started
producing SBR in 1976 and currently sells about 165,000 tpy. The project has
estimated cost of US$75 million (in constant 1977 dollars). GUS LIVONIENS
MACIEL LIMITADAS (GLM), a holding company in Porto Alegre, is expected to
set up a joint venture with FIBASE in which GLM will have a majority share
and which in turn will provide about a third of the equity of the project.
All debt financing will be covered by BNDE.
5.21      POLITENO plans to set up its 100,000 tpy LDPE plant as a subsid-
iary, using the technology and experience acquired with their Bahia plant.
The project is estimated to cost US$91 million (in 1977 dollars). The funds
that the present company will have available to invest are dependent on the
cash generation of their Bahia plant which is not likely to reach commercial
operation until mid- 1978. It is expected that the Rio Grande do Sul LDPE
unit sponsored by POLITENO will therefore be commissioned about six months
after the other units and COPESUL. Apart from internal cash generation,

equity financing is expected to be provided by POLITENO's major shareholders,
by the Southern APLUB group, and by FIBASE and PETROQUISA. BNDE and FINEP
are to provide debt financing.
5.22      POLISUL is a company that has been established by IPIRANGA with
Hoechst do Brazil and PETROQUISA to construct and operate a 60,000 tpy HDPE
plant in the Complex. IPIRANGA is a large company which started out in
the oil industry and now also has investments in the fertilizer and food
processing industries, among others. For this project, IPIRANGA may form
a 60%-40% joint venture with FIBASE, to finance its 40% equity participa-
tion. PETROQUISA is tentatively considering a 20% equity participation.
IFC may also participate. Hoechst do Brazil will finance a large part of
foreign equipment and will receive for this and for the sale of the tech-
nology, a 40% equity participation. Hoechst (FRG) will arrange foreign debt
financing. Besides supply the technology, Hoechst do Brazil will also supply
its marketing know-how and will be responsible for the sale of the first three
years of production. For other debt financing, POLISUL will rely on BNDE
and possibly IFC.
5.23      PETROPAR, together with Hercules (US) and PETROQUISA, plans to
establish a new company to construct and operate a 50,000 tpy polypropylene
plant in the Complex. This plant is projected to be expanded to 100,000 tpy
of polypropylene after 1985. PETROPAR now operates in the petroleum sector
and its shareholders are OLVEBRA (50%), an investment and food processing
group, and MFM (50%), a Southern pension fund. The project may include a
pilot plant for technological and market development research which is ex-
pected to cost US$10 million and would be financed by FINEP. HERCULES will
supply the technology and will be responsible for the initial operation of
the project and the pilot plant. This project will have a captive market
for 50% of its production. IFC might also participate in this project.
5.24      PETROPAR also has CDI approval for a 240,000 tpy MVC/PVC plant
which was planned together with PETROQUISA and a foreign partner. The proj-
ect's scope is now being revised and will possibly consist of a 240,000 tpy
MVC plant and a 150,000 tpy PVC plant (to be expanded after 1985). It is
also currently being restructured since the original foreign partner has now
decided to provide only the know-how without participating in the equity.
PETROPAR has currently contacted two possible alternative partners. In view
of this, it is expected that the MVC/PVC unit will come on stream six months
later than most the other downstream units.
5.25      OXITENO plans to set up a 125,000 tpy styrene plant as a subsid-
iary. The plant, which is scheduled to come on stream in July 1983, would
also produce about 55,000 tpy of propylene oxide and glycols, and the company
is also evaluating the possibility of a supplementary project to produce
polyalcohols. Part of the styrene output of the above plant will be used
by a related polystyrene unit to be included in the Complex under the spon-
sorship of PETROAPLUB. Although the total capacity envisaged for this plant
is 60,000 tpy of PS, it is likely that initially only one 20,000 tpy train
will be installed as early as 1979, thus becoming the first unit to be com-
missioned within the Complex. The overall financing scheme for the styrene/
polystyrene plant group, worth US$165 million in constant 1977 dollars, is
still very tentative.



- 32 -
D.   Implementation and Coordination of the Complex
5.26      The general implementation schedule for the Complex is shown in
Annex 5-4. All except one of the main seven downstream units are expected to
come on stream substantially at the same time as COPESUL in early 1982, or
during 1982.  Preliminary negotiation for financing has started for all the
downstream projects, but since their implementation schedule is more than
one year shorter than COPESUL's, they are still at the early stages of their
implementation programs.
5.27      COPESUL, with the assistance of PETROQUISA, will assume the coor-
dinating role for the entire Petrochemical Complex. COPESUL will coordinate
all technical aspects of the Complex and PETROQUISA will coordinate progress
in arranging financing, Government approvals, establishing a satisfactory cor-
porate structure for downstream units and overall manpower training. During
the implementation of the Second Complex, COPENE, also with the assistance
of PETROQUISA, successfully performed similar coordination responsibilities.
Therefore, the contemplated arrangements are considered satisfactory. Con-
firmation of the coirdination responsibilities of PETROQUISA and COPESUL has
been obtained. Furthermore, to facilitate the smooth implementation of all
the parts of the Complex, the Federal and State Governments have agreed to
promptly issue the authorization and approvals required for the construction
and operation of all the facilities included in the Complex.
VI. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Scope
6.01      The proposed Project consists of the COPESUL Raw Materials and
Utilities Plant, which will form the core of the Third Petrochemical Com-
plex described in Chapter III and around which the second, and some of the
later third generation industries will be established.
6.02      The COPESUL project includes, (i) the raw materials plant which
will primarily furnish ethylene, propylene, butadiene and benzene to the
downstream units, and (ii) the utilities plant designed to supply not only
the raw materials plant, but also the downstream units with steam and
treated water. The subunits of the raw materials plant are shown on the
flow-sheet in Annex 6-1. 1/
6.03      The main subunit is the naphtha (or ethylene) cracker, where ethyl-
ene and its co-products (para 2.06) are formed through the cracking of naphtha
at very high temperatures in the presence of water vapor. It includes facili-
ties for the separation of ethylene, propylene and other petroleum-based de-
rivatives in a complex series of steps including compression, refrigeration,
fractionation and heat recovery. The cracker will have flexibility to pro-
duce a range of product mixes by modifying the degree of cracking severity
1/ Details on these subunits are contained in the COPESUL Petrochemical
Project Feasibility Study. (Project File, reference F)

(para 2.07), with no significant change in raw materials consumption. The
process employed is a modern, economic scale design, based on commercially
proven technology. The Project's capacity is shown below.

a/   Returned to refinery or used as fuel.  Some propylene containing im-
purities will also be returned with LPG.
6.04      The amount of ethylene produced can vary between 420,000 and
472,000 tpy. The currently envisaged downstream units would consume about
420,000 tpy by 1985 (Annex 6-2) initially and production can easily be in-
creased. Other downstream projects are under consideration or could be
added in the future (para 3.04). Therefore the flexibility incorporated
into COPESUL plant's design is desirable and adequate.
B.   Raw Materials, Utilities and Infrastructure
6.05      The main raw material for the COPESUL project is straight-run
naphtha to be supplied via a pipeline of about 25 km from the PETROBRAS
REFAP refinery. The refinery is currently being expanded to meet the re-
quirements of COPESUL (1.5 million tpy of naphtha), and those of other users
in the South region. COPESUL will produce liquified petroleum gas (LPG),
pyrolysis gasoline and by-products which will be returned to REFAP via a
pipeline or used internally as fuel. PETROBRAS will also have a facility
to deliver naphtha from a nearby (150 km) marine terminal through a pipe-
line system that also provides crude oil to the refinery. The naphtha
supply and the by-product arrangements are considered satisfactory, and
assurances have been obtained from PETROBRAS that the Project will have
satisfactory access to its petroleum product requirements.
6.06      COPESUL's utilities plant includes steam production, water treat-
ment, nitrogen production, and power generation and distribution facilities.
Steam for the raw materials plant and for the downstream units will be produced
by three large boilers using low grade coal (47 to 50% ash content) from
nearby mines. The boilers will also have the provision of using fuel oil if
coal is in short supply. The private coal mines, which will be the primary



- 34 -
suppliers, are to be expanded to provide the requirements of COPESUL and of
other users. A State coal company could also provide back-up coal supplies.
Ample reserves exist throughout the State, with little alternative uses.
COPESUL has been requested, and has agreed, to coordinate closely with the
coal supply project. Agreement has been reached with the State of Rio Grande
do Sul that it will ensure that adequate back-up supplies of coal will be made
available for the efficient operation of the Project if the supply of coal
from private sources were to fall short of requirements.
6.07      COPESUL will have water intakes at the nearby Cai river and water
treatment and demineralization facilities for utility and process requirements
are included in the Project. Cooling water will be circulated in a conven-
tional manner in cooling towers to minimize water intake and subsequent
effluent problems (para 6.20). COPESUL will install two 15 MW turbogenerators
which will provide power for critical operations (18 MW out of 24 MW total
demand) which cannot tolerate any disturbance in power supply. The remaining
power needs will be met by supplies from the national grid. The State of Rio
Grande do Sul has agreed to ensure that adequate supplies of power will be
made available as required for the full utilization of the facilities included
in the Complex.
6.08      Other infrastructure facilities include primarily sewage treatment
(para 6.21), a river jetty (to be shared with PETROBRAS and downstream compa-
nies) and road and rail extensions to the site. While decisions on these
facilities are not immediately needed generally due to shorter implementation
periods, assurances have appeared to be needed that adequate planning and
management will be available to start implementations of all of these projects
to complete them in time. The State has agreed to cause CONPETRO, the State
agency in charge of coordinating infrastructure projects, to complete the
infrastructure required for the Complex on a time schedule agreeable to the
Bank. It seems however unlikely that CONPETRO will be able to perform en-
tirely without any outside assistance. COPESUL has therefore already agreed
with CONPETRO to provide the required level of assistance in infrastructure
projects and to actually take on implementation if they were to fall behind
schedule. Confirmation of COPESUL's and also PETROQUISA's role in that
respect has been obtained from the State. With PETROQUISA and COPESUL assum-
ing the general coordinating responsibilities outlined under para 5.27,
overall implementation procedures are considered adequate.
C.   Engineering
6.09      COPESUL has contracted with a consortium of two foreign engineering
firms - Compagnie Francaise d'Etudes de Construction (Technip), France and
Kinetics Technology International (KTI), Netherlands - and two Brazilian
engineering firms - PROMON and MONTREAL - for engineering services related to
the design, installation and start-up of the COPESUL Project. 1/ Technip will
1/   The basic engineering contract and technology transfer subproject (para
6.15) have already been financed by the Interamerican Development Bank,
see IDB Report, Project on Technology and Engineering Services for the
Petrochemical Industry (Project File, reference B).



- 35 -
be the prime contractor in the consortium and KTI will supply basic technology
and the ethylene furnace design. The contract will cover complete basic de-
sign and detail engineering work for all the production units and auxiliary
services needed to implement the COPESUL project. These services will include
(i) the selection, procurement, inspection of equipment; (ii) planning and
schedule control; (iii) supervision of the construction, installation and
assembly and (iv) supervision of initial operation of all industrial units.
The engineering services will be provided concurrently with the technology
transfer subproject (para 6.15) and Technip will have prime responsibility
for both. The technical data for COPESUL will be used in the training
activities of the technology subproject, but the two projects are independent
of each other.
6.10      Technip is an engineering design and construction company specializ-
ing in chemical and petrochemical technology, with worldwide project experience.
KTI specializes in furnace design. It is a former subsidiary of Selas Corpo-
ration (US), one of the world's largest suppliers of furnaces for chemical
processing, including ethylene and ammonia plants. The combined experience of
Technip/KTI for ethylene plants is 15 units of which 11 are in operation and
9 are units with capacity in excess of 300,000 tpy and a technology similar
to the COPESUL project. The Technip/KTI consortium is thus considered well
qualified to design and implement the Project.
6.11      The basic engineering will comprise all information necessary for
preparation of the final detailed designs, including process flow charts,
layouts, material and heat balances, water supply, steam and electric energy
balances, pipe and instrument diagrams, plans, specifications of equipment
and materials, specifications of instruments and of flows of residual gases
and liquid waste, as required for each of the following main subunits of
COPESUL and the related services: (i) ethylene section (pyrolysis and
butadiene extraction); (ii) aromatics section; (iii) internal systems for
generation and distribution of utilities; (iv) external systems for stor-
age, shipping facilities and utilities systems; (v) effluent control.
6.12      The project also includes several complementary processing steps
involving additional licensing of technology. These processes have already
been selected after analysis of several competing bids. The processes and
the firms are: (i) extraction of butadiene - Nippon-Zeon (Japan); (ii)
hydrogenation of pyrolysis gasoline - IFP (France); (iii) aromatics extrac-
tion - UOP (USA); (iv) toluene dealkylation - HRI (USA). These licensing
arrangements are directly with COPESUL (or PETROBRAS) and include all basic
engineering.
6.13      The final detailed designs for all of the facilities required for
COPESUL will be prepared by PROMON and MONTREAL, two local engineering firms
under the direct supervision of Technip. The subcontractors for the detailed
engineering will be responsible to Technip, which in turn will be responsible
to COPESUL. The detailed engineering will comprise civil, structural, mechani-
cal and electrical engineering, implementation, planning and other services
for establishment of the units producing the petrochemical raw materials,
support and off-sites systems, auxiliary services, storage systems and in-
terconnections, as well as the other systems required for the operation of
COPESUL.



- 36 -
6.14      Technip will provide competent technical personnel to coordinate
and supervise the detailed engineering work that will be performed in Brazil
by the subcontractors. This supervision will be carried out mainly through
staff of COPESUL. Technip will also perform on-site supervision of all
activities related to the construction, as well as control of costs, budget
and schedules during construction.
D.   Technology Transfer
6.15      A major element in the Technip/KTI contract is the transfer of tech-
nology to Brazil for the design, construction and operation of complete ethyl-
ene plants, in addition to the COPESUL Project itself (paras 2.22 and 6.09).
Technip/KTI will provide to the PETROBRAS group (including COPESUL), PETROQUISA,
as well as the local engineering companies, the following technology transfer
services: (i) training of PETROBRAS and engineering company personnel, (ii)
transfer of all technical documentation, (iii) design of experimental units,
(iv) technical advisory services. This program will permit the several
Brazilian companies to acquire ethylene technology fully through experience
and to adapt it to local conditions. As a result, the Brazilian technical
teams are expected to acquire the capability to design ethylene plants and
integrated petrochemical complexes and increase the level of Brazilian supply
in subsequent projects, and the potential to sell the technology outside
Brazil.
6.16      The technology for production of petrochemical raw materials, and
the basic engineering for the ethylene plant, will be transferred principally
to Centro de Pesquisas e Desenvolvimento (CENPES), PETROBRAS' research and
development center. CENPES has modern and well-equipped laboratories and
auxiliary facilities for research and development, located adjacent to the
Rio de Janeiro Federal University and to other research centers. At present
CENPES has staff of 750, and its research and development work serves the
entire PETROBRAS system. Research is conducted chiefly in the following
areas: (i) exploration and production of petroleum; (ii) petroleum refining;
(iii) petrochemicals and polymers; and (iv) product development.
E.   Project Management and Schedule
6.17      The Project will be implemented by COPESUL using its own staff
plus experienced personnel seconded on long term assignment from PETROBRAS,
PETROQUISA and COPENE (para 5.14). The Technical Director and the Procure-
ment Manager, both highly experienced and capable, will manage and coordinate
all engineering and procurement. International and local procurement services
will be obtained from Technip/KTI and PROMON/MONTREAL, respectively. Civil
works, construction and erection will be the responsibility of the COPESUL
Project Manager, who has just joined COPESUL after successfully completing
an assignment as Deputy Project Manager of COPENE in the Second Petrochemical
Complex. Technip will provide construction supervision personnel (para
6.14) to work under the management of COPESUL. Construction and erection will
be subcontracted to local firms in the South as well as firms from Sao Paulo
and Bahia with previous petrochemical plant construction experience.



- 37 -
6.18      Administration and financial planning will be handled from Rio de
Janeiro by the Financial Director, who has adequate financial and banking
experience. The COPESUL project team is also involved in training (para.
6.24) and general coordination for the Complex (paras 5.27 and 6.08). Most of
the staff will continue with the Project during commissioning and commercial
operations, with construction and engineering task forces being phased out at
later stages of project execution and put in charge of operations or replaced
by operations staff according to a well-prepared project administration and
planning system. Arrangements for project management and staff training
are thus satisfactory and a smooth transition to the operating phase is
expected.
6.19      The COPESUL project is complex and is expected to require 48 months
from the start of detailed engineering for implementing both the raw materials
and the utilities plant. A detailed project implementation schedule for the
Project is shown in Annex 6-3. Engineering work started in May 1977, and clear-
ing work on the site in September 1977. The COPENE project was implemented in
about the same construction time. Since a significant part of COPESUL staff
has had experience under the latter project, and with the faster equipment
deliveries now offered by suppliers, the prospects of achieving the project
schedule and start commercial operations in January 1982 are judged good.
F.   Environment
6.20      COPESUL has proposed to set environmental standards for the entire
Complex similar to the design parameters established for the Bahia Petro-
Chemical Complex, which are generally in line with standards currently used
in most developed countries.   Each unit (or company) included in the Complex
will be responsible for primary water, solid and air effluent control including
chemical or physical removal of pollutants particular to each process unit
to levels conforming with relevant federal and state codes. A centrali2ed
effluent treatment unit under COPESUL will handle secondary water treatment,
including oil removal and a biological degrading and neutralization system
prior to discharge of water to the adjacent Rio Cai, for all the units included
in the Complex. COPESUL has agreed to ensure that the execution and operation
of the Project will be carried out with due regard to ecological and environ-
mental factors, and in accordance with the pollution control laws of the
Federal and State Governments.
6.21      A major problem in effluent control, however, is the lack of specific
State standards and the apparent weak State-level administrative system to
establish such standards. 1/ COPESUL has taken the lead in establishing
adequate standards based on design parameters followed in the Bahia Complex
but cannot proceed with actual design until the standards are officially
agreed upon. Adequate assurances have therefore been obtained from the State
Governments that official effluent standards will be established by September
30, 1978.
1/   General Federal standards exist and are adequate, but can be rendered
tighter or more specific by the State authorities.

6.22      The Project includes adequate provisions regarding safety and health
standards in the processing and treating of the various chemicals and fuels
to be used within the Complex and the Project.
G.   Employment and Training of Operating Staff
6.23      The Project will provide direct employment for about 1,400 people,
most of whom are professional or skilled craftsmen. The staff will be re-
cruited in the South primarily from Porto Alegre as well as transferred
from PETROBRAS, PETROQUISA and COPENE. Downstream units will require addi-
tional direct employment of about 4,000 people. The several companies in
the Complex are likely to be competing for the limited number of highly
qualified personnel available, and PETROQUISA will, therefore, coordinate
employment and training procedures for the entire Complex, as part of its
overall coordination functions (para 5.27).
6.24      The Project sponsors, and their engineering consultants, have re-
cognized, and adequately addressed, the necessity to staff the Complex with
highly skilled and experienced staff, and the relative shortage of skilled
manpower. PETROBRAS and PETROQUISA/COPESUL have an excellent, well-established
training program to provide the necessary skilled personnel. The program
includes scholarships for university training for engineering and management,
training in technical schools, on-the-job training in existing Brazilian
facilities, training in similar international companies and with the engineer-
ing companies. Under the technology transfer sub-project, Technip will also
provide training facilities for specialist operating staff. For key manage-
ment positions, experienced and qualified staff are transferred (and promoted)
from existing similar operations. Local authorities, in this case primarily
the University of Porto Alegre, are given a major role in training, including
recruiting and use (and upgrading) of local technical and engineering schools.
The training needs of the Project and the Complex are expected to be satisfac-
torily met.
VII. PROJECT COST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A.   Capital Costs
7.01      Total financing requirements of the Project, including working
capital and interest during construction, are estimated at US$836.0 million,
of which foreign exchange needs amount to US$295.7 million equivalent.
Details are shown in Annex 7-1 and summarized below:

insurance.
c/   Includes US$69.0 million of indirect foreign exchange, estimated at
25% of local equipment plus 15% of civil works and buildings.
7.02      Land and site improvement costs, licenses and basic engineering
costs are based on fixed price contracts, and estimates include no contin-
gencies for these items; for detailed engineering, which is largely on a
cost plus basis, physical and price contingencies are included. Equipment
and materials costs have been conservatively estimated based on detailed data
from the COPENE project, from Technip/KTI, and on quotes from Brazilian equip-
ment manufacturers, taking the 50/50 split between locally reserved and inter-
national procurement into account (para 7.10). After 10% physical contingen-
cies, the constant dollar estimate for equipment, materials and services is
judged satisfactory, although somewhat conservative for certain items. For
civil works and building costs, extra physical contingencies (about 15%)
have been added; they are reasonable at this stage of project preparation.
Escalation is estimated at 7.5% for 1977/78, 7.5% for 1978/79 and 7% there-
after for equipment and materials, and other items, except for fixed price
contracts already awarded for licenses and basic engineering; and 9% for
1977/78, 9% for 1978/79 and 8% thereafter for civil works and buildings.
This estimated international price escalation rate was used for both local
and foreign purchases of equipment (expressed in US$) on the assumption that



- 40 -
differences in the international and domestic inflation rates will be ac-
counted for by adjustments in the exchange rate. Such adjustments are the
current Government policy, which is expected to continue. The Project has
been exempted from custom duties on imported equipment and materials. The
working capital estimate is based on COPESUL's specifications for storage
capacities and inventories, which are adequate, and on normal payment terms
of 30 days for both accounts payable and receivable. Financial charges
during construction, at US$79 million, appears high in absolute terms but
are in line with total project costs and the four-year construction schedule.
The total project cost estimates, which after appropriate adjustments are
consistent with the expected final costs of the COPENE project, are considered
reasonable.

- 41 -
7.04      Equity financing, equivalent to 40% of total financing required,
will be provided by PETROQUISA (51%) and FIBASE (49%), with the understand-
ing that the private companies sponsoring the downstream plants may at any
time purchase shares from FIBASE. PETROQUISA and FIBASE have agreed to
provide adequate and timely equity funds to complete the Project.
7.05      The major debt financing source is BNDE (29% of financing require-
ments) with a loan in local currency of US$241.7 million equivalent, at 6%
annual interest after monetary correction. The BNDE Loan Agreement was signed
in December 1976 and provided for a relatively short repayment period of 10
years including a 4.5 years grace period (repayment was to start in mid-1981,
before commercial operation). These repayment terms lead to an unacceptable
debt service coverage ratio for COPESUL. COPESUL has been requested to rene-
gotiate the loan to provide: (i) a repayment period giving an acceptable debt
service coverage ratio to COPESUL; (ii) that the grace period of the loan be
extended to 5.5 years, and BNDE has agreed. In addition, the timely and
adequate provision of BNDE funds and all other financing required by COPESUL,
including any financing needed to cover cost overruns on terms satisfactory to
the Bank, will be guaranteed by the Government.
7.06      IDB will provide two loans totalling US$111.7 million, or 13%
of project financing. The first IDB Loan Agreement was signed in October
1977 (Project File, Reference B), to cover US$16.2 million in foreign engi-
neering and licensing costs. The second IDB loan, directly to COPESUL, is
scheduled to be presented to the IDB Board at about the same time as the
proposed Bank loan, and is expected to amount to US$95.5 million. It would
have a repayment period of 15.5 years including 4.5 years of grace, plus an
annual interest of 7.5%. It would finance 85% of the boiler system of the
utilities plant.
7.07      The proposed World Bank loan of US$85 million also to be made
directly to COPESUL will cover about 10% of total project financing require-
ments and 29% of foreign costs. It will primarily cover equipment and mate-
rials for COPESUL's raw materials plant, procured from a list agreed with the
Bank, as well as 15% of the boiler system (jointly with IDB). The loan would
be made directly to COPESUL, at 10% annual interest, including a guarantee fee
to the Government of 2.5%. The proposed repayment period would be 15 years
including 3 years of grace. The foreign exchange risk on the Bank loan (as
on the IDB loans and commercial credits), will be borne by the Company.
7.08      The remaining imported equipment and materials, totalling about
US$35 million, will be procured (using international shopping) taking into
consideration offers of financing as well as the technical and economic merits
of the proposals. A syndicate of French banks led by Credit Lyonnais has
offered a tied credit line with attractive terms (8.6% interest, 14.5 years
repayment including 4 years of grace), provided a minimum level (US$22 mil-
lion) of orders to the French industry is attained. French suppliers are
expected to win about US$25 million in orders after international shopping.
Since the credit line would finance only 85% of the contract values, about ~



- 42 -
US$22 million of the French credit is expected to be used. The downpayments
on French supplies and the remaining equipment to be procured using the above
outlined international shopping procedure would be financed by commercial
loans (normal suppliers' credits and Eurocurrency loans). The commercial
loans would also finance foreign exchange items not covered by the other
sources (such as part of engineering and licensing costs, preoperatiiig costs,
and interest during construction). Tentative offers have already been made
by at least two sources. However, since such financing is not needed in
significant amounts during 1978 and would carry   shorter repayment terms,
COPESUL may not finalize these loans before the proposed Bank loan becomes
effective. Therefore, agreement has been obtained from COPESUL that it will
take the measures required to obtain, not later than June 30, 1979, commercial
loans in such aggregate amount (currently estimated at US$32 to 33 million
equivalent) as should be required for purposes of the Project and on terms and
condition acceptable to the Bank. In addition, general assurances have been
obtained from the Government as the Guarantor that additional foreign exchange
financing, on terms satisfactory to the Bank, will be arranged in case the
French credit line cannot be economically used to the extent assumed above.
7.09      In drawing up its financing plan, COPESUL has tried to maximize the
use of bilateral and multilateral financing sources open to Brazil, with due
consideration for the need to assure a satisfactory debt service coverage and
sound financial structure, and to minimize costs through competitive procure-
ment. The resulting financing plan is somewhat complex and difficult to
administer, but is judged to achieve its goals in a satisfactory manner.
C.   Procurement
7.10      COPESUL has reached an agreement with CACEX, the Brazilian agency
on equipment imports, which provides for an overall 50/50 split of equipment
and materials between locally reserved items and items procured from inter-
national sources. The reserve list was structured to minimize project cost
penalties and includes items that the domestic equipment manufacturing in-
dustry has the capability to supply without serious delivery or performance
problems. Normal Brazilian procurement policies would have resulted in an
overall 70 to 80% national reserve list, with a cost penalty exceeding US$50
million. The agreement between COPESUL and CACEX is considered satisfactory.
7.11      Procurement arrangements have been agreed with COPESUL, and reviewed
with IDB with respect to the boiler system, which will be jointly financed
(para. 7.07). Items other than interest during construction to be financed
from Bank funds will be awarded following ICB procedures in accordance with
the Bank's Procurement Guidelines, allowing for a 15% margin of preference
to local suppliers (the import duty rate for equipment is greater than 40%).
Procurement based on bids or quotations from a reasonable number of suppliers
would however be allowed (i) for imported items costing less than US$200,000
each up to an aggregate amount of US$11 million and (ii) for imported critical
and highly specialized items up to an aggregate amount of US$9 million; these
items are described separately in the list of goods to be financed from Bank
funds and are not judged suitable for full ICB based on a number of time,
expense and technical considerations reviewed with COPESUL's technical staff.



- 43-
To avoid a costly 2-4 months delay, 1/ procurement action has started on
long delivery items critical to the timely completion of the Project.
An estimated US$20 million in contracts for equipment and material to
be financed by the Bank are expected to be committed by March 31, 1978.
These contracts would involve down payments after February 1, 1978 of
an estimated US$4 million. To assist in timely project completion it
is recommended that these levels of advance contracting and retroactive
payments, on items included in the list of goods to be financed by the
Bank, be eligible for disbursements from the Bank loan.
D.   Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
7.12      The allocation of the proposed loan would be as follows:
Allocation of Bank Loan
(US$ million)
Amount           Disbursement
1.   Boiler System for Utilities Plant    13.0    15% of foreign expenditures
2.   Equipment and Materials for            53.0    100% of foreign expenditures
Raw Materials Plant                              or 100% of ex-factory cost
of local supply
3.   Interest During Construction           11.0    Amounts due
4.   Unallocated                             8.0
Total                             85.0
7.13      COPESUL is a newly formed corporate entity and will not generate any
funds on its own until commercial operations start in 1982. A total of US$79
million of financial charges during construction, out of which about US$39
million is in foreign exchange, will have to be paid during the construction
period, placing a large burden on the Company. Since the financing plan is
already complex (paras. 7.03 and 7.09), it is highly desirable that various
lending sources also provide financing for interest during construction on
their respective loans. It is therefore recommended that the proposed Bank
loan include financing of interest during construction (on the Bank loan)
estimated at US$11 million. IDB considers financing such interest on its
own loan.
7.14      It is expected that 80% of the Bank loan will be disbursed against
foreign exchange expenditures. However, it should be noted that all foreign
financing sources together will only cover 88% of total direct and indirect
foreign exchange requirements of the Project. The Bank loan is expected to
be fully disbursed by the end of June 30, 1982. Any funds remaining undis-
bursed at that time will be cancelled. A disbursement schedule is given in
Annex 7-3.
1/   Delays for COPESUL would delay the entire Complex and would carry a high
cost to the economy by postponing the large foreign exchange savings
expected (para 9.08).

VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Revenue and Operating Cost Estimates
8.01      Due to the difficulties in estimating future inflation rates in
Brazil, the financial projections are expressed in current US dollars, in-
stead of cruzeiros; using an assumed international inflation rate of 7.5% per
annum until 1979 and 7.0% thereafter. This approach assumes that any dif-
ference between domestic and international inflation is taken care of by
appropriate exchange rate adjustments, which has generally been the case in
the past. The detailed assumptions made and the results of the financial
analysis of the Project are given in Annex 8-1 and summarized below.
8.02      It is assumed that the Project will start commercial production in
January, 1982, and that capacity utilization will increase from 50% during
the first year of operations to 100% during the fourth year (1985) and there-
after. (Annex 6-2 contains the detailed assumptions, including those pertain-
ing to the commissioning and operating levels of the downstream units, which
lead to the above production build-up for the Project). The Project will also
produce and sell most of the utilities the downstream units require, such as
steam and water. The production buildup of various products and utilities is
assumed to be proportional to the overall capacity utilization of the plant.
8.03      Petrochemical price ceilings are fixed by the CIP based on each
petrochemical unit's actual cost structure to allow petrochemical companies
an after tax return on investment of about 16% (para 4.22). In case this
formula was applied to COPESUL, its sales prices would have to be approxi-
mately 40% higher than those currently allowed to Sao Paulo's Petroquimica
Uniao which was built before 1972. Similar problems arise for COPENE, which
will start to operate in mid-1978. As mentioned in para 4.23, the Govern-
ment intends to review its pricing policy for the petrochemical and other
subsectors, and it is difficult to predict its outcome in view of the com-
plexity of the problem. In the meantime, an adjustment in the price of
COPENE's naphtha feedstock has reportedly been proposed to enable it to
charge prices similar to Petroquimica Uniao. Since the output of the Second
and Third Complexes will almost entirely substitute for imports of final or
intermediate petrochemicals which are currently highly penalized through
import duties and deposits (para 4.03), there is however significant room
for an increase in the general price level of the local production of such
products without affecting the development of the petrochemical market. The
assumption that the core plants of the new Complexes will also be able to
charge higher prices for the basic raw materials which they will produce is
consistent with this view, and is therefore believed to be more reasonable -
beyond the short run - than that of a continued naphtha subsidy policy de-
signed to enable these plants to keep the prices of such products on a parity
with Petroquimica Uniao's prevailing prices. This is particularly so taking
into account that from a public finance point of view, the burden of such
subsidies would combine itself to the loss of substantial duty revenues
on imported petrochemicals.



- 45 -
8.04      Since it is probable that CIP's pricing policies and parameters
will be modified as part of the Government's review of the pricing system,
and for the purposes of the financial analysis of the COPESUL Project, it
is conservatively assumed that, when it will start commercial production
in 1982, COPESUL wlll be able to charge prices only 20% above Petroquimica
Uniao's prevailing prices (in real terms). This figure has been merely
retained as a conservative working assumption, and the Government has agreed
that it would not take, or permit to be taken, any action with respect to
the prices of the products of COPESUL which would preclude the Company,
operating efficiently, from earning a reasonable return on investment (para
8.12). Detailed product price and revenue data for the Project are shown in
Annex 8-2.
8.05      The price of naphtha is fixed by the CNP (National Petroleum Coun-
cil) and the Ministry of Finance. Since all petrochemical prices are directly
or indirectly pegged to the price of naphtha, naphtha prices are only changed
after a careful study of the petrochemical industry. The Brazilian naphtha
price is currently US$120/ton, about the same as the international naphtha
price. It is expectEd that the Government will continue to adjust the naphtha
price to account for the domestic inflation, and changes in the international
naphtha price. For this analysis it has therefore been assumed that domestic
naphtha prices paid by COPESUL will remain in line with international prices.
8.06      Coal, the other major input needed by the Project, will be obtained
from coal mines located nearby (para. 6.06). Coal prices are fixed by the
Government at a highly subsidized rate to promote its use. The current coal
production costs at these mines are estimated at US$14.1/ton at mine head and
US$19.2/ton at COPESUL's plant site, compared to the expected subsidized
price of US$9.2/ton delivered. This latter price is used in the base case of
the financial analysis, since the Government is expected to continue to
encourage, through low coal prices, the use of domestic energy resources to
reduce Brazil's reliance on imported oil, and sensitivity analysis was con-
ducted on the coal price.
B.   Financial Projections
8.07      The detailed projected income, balance sheet, and sources and uses
of funds statements for the Project are shown in Annexes 8-3, 8-4, and 8-5

8.08      Net sales are expected to increase from about US$320 million in
1982 to US$780 million in 1985, when the full capacity utilization is ex-
pected to be reached for the first full year; of this principle product
sales will account for about 95% and utilities and other services for about
5%. Naphtha and coal, depreciation and other costs (including labor) account
for 64%, 23% and 13%, respectively of the estimated total annual operating
costs.
8.09      The Project is expected to show a low first year profit due to the
low level of operations and the high interest expense. From the second year
of operations the Project will demonstrate a steady growth of profit after
taxes from US$75 million (14.8% of net sales) in 1983 to US$163 million (21.0%
of net sales) in 1985. The profitability will further increase thereafter
with declining interest payments.  In 1982, the profit and cash breakeven
capacity utilization are calculated at 47% and 24% respectively.
8.10      The Company's debt service payments will reach a peak of US$104
million (20% of net sales) in 1983. Even with this large debt service and
conservative price assumptions (para. 8.04) the Company is projected to show
a satisfactory debt service coverage in all years, with a minimum ratio of 1.6
in the first year of operation (1982). The Project would also maintain a
satisfactory liquidity situation with a minimum liquidity ratio of 1.0 in
1982. Finally, the debt equity ratio will steadily improve from its 54/46
level in 1982, even if the benefit from the revaluation of equity (Annex
8-1) over the years is disregarded.

C.   Financial Rate of Return
8.11      The financial rates of return of the Project in constant terms are
calculated at 15% after taxes and 18% before taxes. Financial cash flows
used to calculate these returns are given in Annex 8-6 and results of sensi-
tivity tests on the financial rate of return are summarized in the table
below. The return is most sensitive to changes in the sales prices and least
sensitive to changes in the capital costs.

D.   Major Risks
8.12      COPESUL will face some financial risks because the prices of its
main raw materials and for all of its products are subject to Government
policies and regulations, and thus outside COPESUL's control. Since the
profitability of COPESUL is strongly affected by these prices (para 8.11),
assurances have been obtained from the Government that it will not take any
measures which would prevent the Company from covering its costs, servicing
its debts and earning a reasonable return on investment under efficient
operations (para 8.04).
8.13      The major risk faced by the Project concerns the implementation
of the main downstreams units, since the timely start up of these units
units and efficient marketing of their products is critical to its success.
In case one or more of these units were delayed substantially beyond their
current schedule, COPESUL, since it has no alternative marketing opportuni-
ties (paras 3.03 and 4.24), would have to operate at a lower than expected
capacity for some time. Due to its low breakeven point (para. 8.09) the
Company is unlikely to face serious financial difficulties under such an
eventuality, even though its profitability would be reduced. Sensitivity
analysis on COPESUL's cash-flow indicates that a six months delay in the
start-up of all the main downstream units would reduce COPESUL's debt ser-
vice 1982 coverage ratio to 1.0. A one-year delay of all the downstream
units would give COPESUL a negative cash flow for 1982 in the order of US$50
million. This risk will be substantially reduced by the Government's agree-
ment to permit price levels that will give reasonable profit levels to the
private investors to retain their interest in implementing their projects



- 48 -
at the earliest and by the assurances obtained from the Government and the
main sponsors of the Complex regarding back-up financing and implementation
arrangements in case private parties are unable to proceed with their proj-
ects as planned (paras 4.26, 5.12 and 5.18). Similarly, the coordinating
role of PETROQUISA/COPESUL (para 5.27) will help minimize potential delays
in the completion of the Complex.
8.14      The Project is, however, not expected to face major management
related risks since PETROBRAS and PETROQUISA have previous experience in
executing similar projects such as the COPENE raw materials plant and since
already experienced staff will be transferred or seconded to the Project
(paras 6.17 to 6.19). Neither does it appear likely that major engineering
and technological risks will arise as the engineering contractors are inter-
nationally recognized and are using proven technology. The local engineering
firms are also experienced due to their previous involvement in COPENE. Thus,
the risks associated with the Project are considered acceptable.
F.   Financial Covenants and Reporting Requirements
8.15      COPESUL has agreed to follow prudent financial practices and to
respect the following financial covenants: (i) maintain a debt/equity ratio
of 70/30 or better until completion and of 60/40 or better thereafter; (ii)
maintain on the date of completion and thereafter a liquidity ratio 1/ of at
least 1.0:1; (iii) not incur any debt if as a result thereof, its debt service
coverage ratio would fall below 1.5; and (iv) continue to have its accounts
audited in time by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. PETROQUISA
and FIBASE, as shareholders of COPESUL, have agreed to provide such funds as
are needed by COPESUL to meet these ratios at Project completion.
8.16      COPESUL has agreed to submit monthly progress reports to the Bank
covering Project costs, progress, procurement status, and cash-flow forecasts,
as well as the overall progress of the Complex, including infrastructure and
downstream projects (para 4.26). Financial statements will be made available
to the Bank on a quarterly basis, and audited annual statements will be made
available no later than four months after the end of the fiscal year audited.
IX. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Costs and Benefits
9.01      In economic terms, the Project is justified as the core raw mate-
rials plant for the Third Complex. However, it is difficult to determine
1/   For a project like COPESUL whose main products cannot be stored in
significant amounts, the liquidity ratio (i.e. current assets exclud-
ing inventories over current liabilities) is a more appropriate indi-
cator than the current ratio.



- 49 -
meaningful international prices for the main output of the Project, ethyl-
ene and propylene, since, due to their gaseous nature, they are not com-
monly traded internationally and are normally used captively (as in the
present case) or transported short distances over a pipeline grid, with
transfer prices varying with a number of factors. Therefore, a Complex-
wide economic analysis, including downstream units, has been made.
9.02      For the economic analysis of the Complex, whose output will essen-
tially substitute for imports, costs and benefits are divided into tradeable
and non-tradeable items and are valued at their respective world market and
domestic prices. The economic rate of return has been calculated using a
shadow exchange rate 25% higher than the official rate to reflect distor-
tions caused by import tariffs, export taxes and subsidies, as well as other
forms of import restrictions and export incentives. The costs and benefits
during the assumed operating life of the Complex--conservatively set at 12
years--are expressed in constant mid-1977 US dollars.
9.03      Capital co3ts for the downstream projects were obtained from their
respective feasibility studies, after deduction of import duties and local
taxes on equipment and other items. Only part of the cost of the infra-
structure projects, which will be implemented together with the Complex,
was debited to the Complex. This is justified because a large portion
of the infrastructure will serve the entire industrial estate hosting other
industries besides the Complex (para 3.05), and some of the jetty and port
facilities would be shared by PETROBRAS and other users (para 6.08). Based
on this allocation, US$150 million out of a total of US$250 million were
conservatively debited to the Complex as its share of infrastructure.
9.04      The prices for the products of the downstream units, mainly ther-
moplastics and SBR, have been based on detailed economic analyses for each
product under different plant locations in the world, and world demand and
supply balance data obtained from specialized consultants. The long-run prices
derived from these data are in most instances close to current European list
prices, and somewhat higher than actual current US and world trading prices.
With the expected oil and gas price deregulations, and the US petrochemical
producers turning from ethane feedstock to the heavier feedstocks already
used by European producers (para 2.06), European price levels are considered
more representative in the long-run than current US prices. Since the prod-
ucts of the Complex will substitute for imports, a freight and insurance
differential was applied, ranging from 5 to 19% depending on the product, and
based on historical Brazilian data.
9.05      With the downstream units receiving most of their raw material
requirements from COPESUL 1/, the single most important input to the Complex
is naphtha. The naphtha price was taken as the FOB international price of
US$120/ton. The international price is considered representative of the
1/   Except for the MVC/PVC unit which will receive ethylene dichloride
from the Northeast, plus ethylene from COPESUL.



- 50 -
price at which it will be produced by the REFAP refinery, whose size and
up-to-date processes make it fully competitive by international standards.
Another important input to the Complex is the coal to be used by COPESUL to
produce steam for itself and all the downstream units. The value of this
low-grade coal, which cannot be economically shipped over long distances due
to its high ash content, was taken to be the actual extraction, preparation
and handling costs, based on data submitted by the coal company and super-
vising federal agencies. The economic price for coal is thus calculated at
US$17/ton after shadow-pricing (para 9.02), which is 185% of the financial
price after subsidy (para 8.06). Economic prices and costs for the main
inputs and outputs of the Complex are given in Annex 9-1.
B.   Economic Rate of Return
9.06      Under the assumptions outlined above, the economic rate of return
for the Complex, including COPESUL and the seven already approved downstream
projects, is calculated at 19.5% (Annex 9-2). The same sensitivity tests
were carried out for the economic analysis as for the financial analysis and
are summarized below:
COPESUL - Sensitivity Texts on Economic Rate of Return
(in %)
Base Case                                              19.5
Capital Costs up 10%                                   17.8
Capital Costs down 10%                                 21.5
Operating Costs up 10%                                 18.0
Operating Costs down 10%                               21.0
Capacity Utilization down 10%                          17.2
Delay of Completion (1 year)                           16.7
Product prices down 10%                                15.5
Product prices up 10%                                  23.0
9.07      The economic rate of return shows a high sensitivity to changes
in product prices and to a lesser degree to changes in operating (primarily
naphtha) and capital costs. Using the official instead of the shadow foreign
exchange rate the base return would be 15%. The satisfactory economic return
of the Complex reflects the advantages of large-scale and integrated facili-
ties, coordinated implementation, and the high degree of operating efficiency
expected.
C.   Other Benefits
9.08      In 1976, Brazil imported US$3.2 billion of crude oil, and US$1.1
billion of petrochemicals (paras 2.18 and 4.02). Only 5% of the crude oil is
currently used to make petrochemicals. After the Second and Third Complexes
are commissioned, this proportion will increase to about 7%, while petro-
chemical imports will have been substantially reduced. Net annual foreign
exchange earnings and savings for the Rio Grande do Sul Complex (once
operating at full capacity) are estimated at US$510 million at 1977 prices,
or about 12% of Brazil's projected current account deficit by 1985.



- 51 -
9.09      Compared to the 1,400 jobs created by COPESUL, about 4,000 will
be created in the second generation plants, and between 10,000 and 12,000
additional jobs at the more labor-intensive third generation level. The
construction of the Complex will employ about 20,000 people, mostly from
the South region, at the peak time. The construction of the Complex, which
implies a large step increase in the investment rate of the South region,
will also have significant effects on the region's development through the
stimulation of related and supplying industries, training and migration.
The technology transfer for COPESUL (para 6.15) and the downstream units
will permit the full absorption of the technology by the Brazilian engineer-
ing and equipment building industries, and will permit greater levels of
Brazilian supply in future projects both in Brazil and abroad.
X. AGREEMENTS
10.01     The following assurances and agreements have been obtained from
the parties concerned:
10.02     From the Federal Government that it will:
(i) cause a special study of petrochemical pricing and
market development to be prepared, furnish the Bank
with its results upon its completion by December 1979,
and afford the Bank an opportunity to comment on its
terms of reference and recommendations (para 4.23);

the timely completion of the infrastructure required
for the Complex (para 5.12);
(iv) not take, or permit to be taken, any action with
regard to the prices of the products of (a) the
Borrower (COPESUL) which would preclude the Bor-
rower, operating efficiently, from covering all
its costs, service its debt, and earn a reasonable
return on investment (paras 8.04 and 8.12), and
(b) the downstream companies which would preclude
these companies, operating efficiently, from earning
a reasonable return on investment (paras 5.18 and
8.13);
(v) promptly issue all authorizations and approvals
required for the construction and operation of all
the facilities included in the Complex (para 5.27);



- 52 -
(vi)  ensure that funds, including those needed to cover
cost overruns on terms satisfactory to the Bank,
will be made available for the timely completion
of the Project (para 7.05);
(vii) guarantee the performance of the obligations of the
Shareholders and of the Borrower (see paras 10.04
and 10.05).
10.03     From the Rio Grande do Sul State Government that it will:
(i)  ensure that funds will be provided as needed for
the timely completion of the infrastructure required
for the Complex (para 5.12);
(ii)  promptly issue all authorizations and approvals
required for the construction and operation of all
the facilities included in the Complex (para 5.27).
(iii) ensure that adequate back-up supplies of coal will be made
available for the efficient operation of the Project
if the supply of coal from private sources were to
fall short of requirements (para 6.06);
(iv)  ensure that adequate supplies of power will be made
available as required for the full utilization of
the facilities included in the Complex (para 6.07);
(v)  cause CONPETRO to complete the infrastructure re-
quired for Complex on a time schedule satisfactory
to the Bank and permit COPESUL and PETROQUISA to
assist CONPETRO if necessary (para 6.08);
(vi)  ensure that adequate effluent standards will be
established by September 30, 1978 (para 6.21);
10.04     From COPESUL's Shareholders (PETROQUISA and FIBASE and their
parent companies PETROBRAS and BNDE) that:
(i)  in case the sponsors of one of the downstream proj-
ects are unable to implement their project in accord-
ance with the planned schedule, PETROQUISA and FIBASE
will make adequate arrangements to ensure that the
construction of such project is carried out according
to a time schedule satisfactory to the Bank (paras
4.26 and 5.12);
(ii)  BNDE and PETROBRAS will assure the provision of
funds to the downstream projects following their
normal financing procedures (para 5.12);



- 53 -
(iii) PETROQUISA will assure adequate coordination of
the implementation of the different parts of the
Complex (para 5.27);
(iv) PETROBRAS will ensure an adequate supply of raw
mat.'.dls to COPESUL (para 6.05);
(v) PETROQUISA and FIBASE will assure the provision of
timely and adequate funds to the Borrower to enable
the Borrower (a) to complete the Project (para 7.04),
and (b) to obtain on the date of its completion a
debt/equity ratio of 60/40 or better and a liquidity
ratio of 1.0:1 or better (para 8.15).
10.05     From the Borrower (COPESUL) that it will:
(i) keep the Bank informed about the progress of the
downstream and infrastructure in addition to its
normal reporting requirements (paras 4.26 and
8.16);
(ii) assure adequate coordination of the implementation
of the different parts of the Complex (para 5.27);
(iii) ensure that the execution and operation of the Proj-
ect are carried out with due regard to ecological
and environmental factors, and in accordance with
the pollution control laws of the Federal Government
and the State (para 6.20);
(iv) take the measures required to obtain, not later
than June 30, 1979, commercial loans in such
aggregate amount (currently estimated at US$32
to 33 million equivalent) as shall be required
for purposes of the Project and on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank (para 7.08);
(v) maintain on the date of completion and thereafter a
liquidity ratio of 1.0:1 or better; maintain a debt/
equity ratio of 70/30 or better before completion
and of 60/40 or better on the date of completion
and thereafter; not incur any debt if as a result
thereof, its debt service coverage ratio would fall
below 1.5:1; and have its accounts audited by an
independent auditor (para 8.15).
10.06     Based on the agreements and assurances listed above, the Project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$85 million equivalent, to be made to
COPESUL, for 15 years, including three years of grace at the Bank's pre-
vailing interest rate, to which a fee payable to the Government would be
added, increasing the cost to COPESUL to 10%.

a) demand forecast based on Bank consultant's review (Project File, reference C)
b)  Above PS supply projections assume that all the trains of the PS unit of the Third Complex will be commissioned
together with Lhe other plants of the Complex.  It is however more likely that one 20,000 tpy train will be
commissioned first and be followed over time by the other trains, as demand builds up (paras 4.19 and 5.25).
c) COPERBO might actually have phased down its production by 1982.

a/ At medium severity level (para 6.03).  The financial and economic analyses are based on this case.  This
is a conservative assumption, since after COPESUL switches to high severity cracking, about 2% points will
be added to its profitability.
b/ The POLIOLEFINAS unit is expected to be able to produce up to 130% of its design capacity. The above build-up
is in line with IFC projections.
c/ Other users include at least three smaller projects presently under development (para 3.04). It is believed
that these three units will use 15-20,000 tpy of ethylene. Since under the assumptions made above for the
main projects only 10,000 tpy of ethylene would be available to "other users" by 1985, it is likely that
COPESUL would have to switch to higher severity cracking no later than 1985.
d/ Based on start of commercial production in these units in July 1982, i.e. six months after the other main down-  z
stream projects (paras 5.21 and 5.24)                                                                                    x
e/ Based on start of commercial production in this unit i.n July 1983. i.e. eighteen months after the other main
downstream projects (para 5.25).

ANNEX 8-1
BRAZIL-COPESUL PETROCHEMICAL PROJECT
MAIN ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
A.          Inflation Accounting
1.     Brazil has been forced to cope with considerable rates of
inflation over the past two decades. In 1964 it promulgated a system of
'monetary corrections and flexible exchange rates' to obtain better control
over rising inflation rates. The 'Brazilian Model' worked satisfactorily
until the oil crisis provoked a sudden push of imported inflation in early
1974 which let inflation rates rise up to a level of about 40% p.a.
2.     To avoid unnecessary distortions as a result of an uncertain
development of Brazil's inflation and to facilitate comparisons with other
similar projects it was decided to express all financial projections in current
US Dollars. Assuming that the policy of the Government taken in the past to
adjusting the foreign exchange value of the Cruzeiro according to the difference
of domestic and international inflation rates will continue, the following
international inflation rates were applied in the financial analysis:
Year              Price Escalation Factor (%)
1977-78                        7.5
1978-79                        7.5
.1979-80 and thereafter        7.0
3.     Since the formulation of the monetary correction system in
1964, a series of laws and decrees were introduced regulating the use of the
monetary correction factors in the financial statements of companies. The
regulations - especially for income tax purposes - change from time to t{Te.
For the purpose of the financial projections the latest accounting rules-
were applied, with the difference that instead of the domestic 'Aonetary
correction factor' the international inflation rate as 'indexing factor'
was used.
1/ Corporation Law - Law No. 6404 of December 15, 1976



ANNEX 8-1
Page 2
4.     According to Brazil's accounting principles, fixed assets -/
as well as local long-term loans are subject to monetary adjustments and are
indexed respectively. The difference between the reevaluation of fixed
assets and of the local long-term loans is added to equity to restore the
balance between the asset and liability side.   Because this difference (or
reevaluation surplus) is added to equity, the debt/equity ratio improves
faster than retained earnings alone would imply. Since the financial projec-
tions are expressed in current US$ there is no need to consider adjustments
reflecting increases of principle repayments for foreign loans due to changes
in the exchange rate. In accordance with the present accounting procedures
applied by PETROBRAS, no provisions for indexation of working capital are made.
B.        Revenues
6.     The assumptions made with respect to the overall production
build-up for the Project are contained in Annex 6-2i/ and the resulting
production volume and revenues are shown in Annex 8-2. As explained in the
main text of this Report (para.8.4), and pending the revision.of the
Country's petrochemical pricing policy, it was assumed that the ex-plant
prices for COPESUL are 120% of PETROQUIMICA UNIAO's mid 1977 ex-plant prices
inflated by the factors presented in paragraph 2 of this Annex.
7.     COPESUL will also generate revenues from the sale of
utilities such as low, medium and high pressure steam and treated process
water as well as from its coproducts such as LPG, pyrolysis residues and
gasoline which it will sell back to the Alberto Pasqualini Refinery. These
coproducts and the utilities will be sold on cost plus allocated overhead basis.,
C.        Operating Cost
8.     All the operating costs are calculated on the basis of pre-
vailing 1977 prices. The resulting operating costs are then escalated by
the international inflation index to the respective year when they enter the
projected income statement.
9.     The prices of feedstock and naphtha ex-pipeline or ex-
distribution terminal used in the financial analysis are based on the latest
information given by the CNP and CIP.
10.     The price for electrical power varies slightly with the
amount of consumption, since part of the power costs are charged on a fixed
monthly basis independently of the amount of consumed KWHs. Based on the
demand forecast for electrical power at1OO% capacity utilization, the price
per KWH amounts to US$ 0.025.
1/ For reasons of simplification, a reevaluation of total fixed assets at
every year end is assumed whereas Brazil's accounting rules allow only
the application of indexation starting with the year following the acquisition.
2/ The capacity utilization levels are determined on the basis of 100% utiliza-
tion over 330 days, leaving 35 days for scheduled maintenance.



ANNEX 8-1
Page 3
11.    The water will be pumped from the Cai River which is
located right beside the plant site. The cost of water is included in
the cost of electric power.
12.    No transportation costs are considered since all
COPESUL's products will be bought over the fence either by the downstream
units which are located within the same petrochemical complex or by the
Alberto Pasqualini Refinery which is also close by.
13.    The project's annual depreciation -/in terms of 1977
prices is calculated as per the following table:
