A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
1.1. This Project is a country program within the context of the US$500 million Multi-Country HIV/AIDS
Program for the Africa Region (MAP) approved by the Board on September 12, 2000. Reference is made
to Section A. Program Purpose and Development Objective of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program
(MAP) Project Appraisal Document (Report No. 20727-AFR). Only key features are highlighted below
which are relevant to the situation of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in The Gambia and the Gambia
Multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS Rapid Response Project (HARRP).
1.2. The Gambia fully meets the criteria for MAP eligibility. In line with the goals of the MAP, the
overarching purpose of this HIV/AIDS Rapid Response Project (HARRP) is to assist the Government of
The Gambia stem a rapid growth of human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) infection which causes the
acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The project will help organize a preemptive response to the
growing lV/AIDS epidemic through a multi-sectoral approach by: (a) maintaining the current low levels
of the epidemic; (b) reducing its spread and mitigating its effects; and (c) increasing access to prevention
services as well as care and support for those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS. The overall project is
premised on the development and expansion of local responses to the epidemic.
1.3. In collaboration with other members of the International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa (IPAA),
the project will help step up, organize, and mainstream the response against HIV/AIDS, sexually
transmitted infections (STIs) and TB, which are important risk co-factors in the early stages of an
lUV/AIDS epidemic. This will be achieved through the provision of HIV/AIDS prevention and care
services at all levels (national, regional, and local) as well as in a number of sectors. The emphasis of the
project will be placed on the prevention among youth, a group that is particularly vulnerable to WV/AIDS
and that represents a large segment of the Gambian population.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
2.1 While a more detailed list of indicators appears in the Logical Framework, the project will contribute to
the achievement of three key targets indicating progress against the goal of slowing the transmission of HV
in The Gambia:
(1)   Increasing the percentage of 15 to 24 year olds with access to HIV/AIDS Informnation, Education
& Communication (IEC) & services;
(2)    Stagnant and low rate of prevalence of WV arnong 15 to 24 year olds; and
(3)    Stagnant and low rate of prevalence of WHV among pregnant women.
2.2. The following constitute the summary indicators for outputs, process, and impact of the program:
A. Output Indicators
I .    At least 50% of population reached through IEC/BCC programs on WV/AIDS.
2.    At least 5 key line Departments are implementing agreed action plans.
3.    The number of sentinel surveillance sites will have increased by 2 in Project Year I and to a total
of 8 by the end of the project.
4.    Disbursements for the Community and Civil Society Initiatives (CCSI) will have reached at least
75% of planned levels.
-2 -



5.    Access to treatment for STIs, TB, and other opportunistic infections available in at least 20% of
health facilities by end of the project.
B. Process Indicators
6.    The National AIDS Council (NAC) fully functioning and formal National HIV/AIDS Strategy and
Plan of Action adopted.
7.    All seven Divisional HIV/AIDS Committees and Municipality equivalents start implementation of
Project activities by the end of Project Year 2
8.    Voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services incorporated into antenatal, TB, and STI
services in 50% of Western Division by the end of Year I and in 50% of health facilities in the other
divisions by Year 5.
C. Impact Indicators
9.    At least 90% of the population (aged 15-49) aware of HIV/AIDS transmission modes and means
of prevention by end of project
10. Use of condom at last sexual contact among young people (aged 15-24) will have increased by 40% by
the end of the project.
I11. Prevalence rates of HIV and STI contained to present levels.
2.3. The project will be tracking the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS through the Health Information System
currently under development and separately, the monitoring of HARRP activities.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: The Gambia (Report No. 18361 GM)              Date of latest CAS discussion:
September 10, 1998
1.1. In the mid-i 990s the HIV/AIDS epidemic was still in its early stages in the Gambia; however the 1998
CAS did mention the need for HIV/AIDS prevention. The CAS also addressed the threat of the sexually
transmitted diseases or infections (STI), which are an important co-factor in the early stages of the spread
of an HIV/AIDS epidemic. The CAS stressed the importance of addressing major public health concems
through preventive rather than curative measures. The instrument that was envisioned in the CAS to tackle
the issue of HIV/AIDS prevention (and its linkage to reproductive health outcomes) was a Population
Policy LIL. Initial preparatory work for the Population Policy LIL operation has been subsequently
subsumed into this larger HIV/AIDS Rapid Response Project. The preemptive nature of this HIV/AIDS
project and its objective to both organize and increase the response against the HIV/AIDS epidemic are
well in line with the overall social and human capital development strategy that is spelled out in the CAS.
Moreover, the proposed operation is fully consistent with the overarching objective of Bank Group
assistance, which is to achieve a sustainable reduction in poverty. Both in the context of the Poverty
Reduction Strategy and HIPC preparations currently underway, HIVIAIDS and reproductive health are
being taken into account (see IDA R2000/221, HIPC Decision Point Document).
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Main Epidemiological Issues
2.1 HIV was first diagnosed in The Gambia in 1986. In 1988 the first sero-prevalence survey was
undertaken and found a consolidated HIV prevalence of 1.8% among adults (people 15 years old and
above), consisting of 1.7% HIV-2 infection and 0.1% HIV-1 infection. This survey was repeated in 1991 at
which time survey data showed an increase of HIV-I infection from 0.1% to 0.5%, whereas HIV-2
- 3 -



infection was stable at 1.7%. From 1993 to 1995, a study undertaken among antenatal mothers showed
similar prevalence rates. Additionally, specific studies of a very high risk group, commercial sex workers
(CSW), reflected a similar trend. While HIV-2 remained relatively stable among CSWs at 2.1%, HIV-l
infection increased in this group from 2.1% in 1989 to 8.1% in 1993. Unfortunately there are no prevalence
data available from 1995 to 1999. However, indirect indicators show a steady increase in the number of
HIV cases as well as an increase in HIV prevalence among blood donors (reaching a consolidated level of
3.5% for HIV-I and HIV-2 in one center in 1999). The predominant means of HIV transmission in The
Gambia is heterosexual. The extent of mother-to-child transmission, contaminated blood products, needle
sharing, and from men having sex with men, is not known.
2.2 Since the beginning of 2000, a sentinel surveillance system has been put in place. The first results show
that HIV-2 continues to be stable at 1.7% of adults, but MIV-1 has now overtaken HIV-2, and HIV-1 has
increased to a level of 1.8%, resulting in a total consolidated HIV prevalence of 3.5% among adults. Thus
on the basis of the most current and reliable data in The Gambia there has been an absolute increase in the
IIV prevalence from 1.7% to 3.5%, representing a doubling in the level of HIV-I and HIV-2 infections
over the past 5 years. What is even of greater concern is that the HIV-1 rate has gone from 0.5% to 1.8%
in the last ten years with indications that the rate of increase has accelerated during the most recent
five-year period. An important co-factor of the HIV prevalence, namely the rate of sexually transmitted
infections (STIs), is very high in The Gambia. A rapid STI assessment conducted in 1994 showed that one
in three pregnant women had signs of an STI, reflecting a high prevalence of these infections not only in
women but also among their husbands/partners. This high level of STIs will also undoubtedly accelerate
the HIV/AIDS epidemic (Condom use and availability have been erratic, with 1997 survey data estimating
that about 5.2 million condoms were available that year, in country, from all sources). Furthermore, the
future trends in the number of cases of tuberculosis (TB) is also increasing and will echo the increase in
HIV-1 prevalence, as has been the case in other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In sum, these factors
indicate that The Gambia has now entered the stage of an exponential increase of HIV-1 infection, one
which is more easily transmissible and damages the immune system faster. The conclusion is that the
country is on the verge of transitioning to a high prevalence country unless preventive actions are taken
quickly.
Government's Initial Response to HIV/AIIDS
2.3. Although aware the HIV/AIDS epidemic had the potential to wipe out hard-won progress made in
improving social indicators in past decades, Gambian Governments did not initially aggressively combat
the virus because of competing demands, concerns about religious leader attitudes, and concerns about
undermining the tourism industry. The Gambia's response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic began modestly in
1986 when the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Social Welfare established the National AIDS Control
Program within the ministry. In 1987, the Cabinet approved the establishment of an advisory body, the
National AIDS Committee, comprised solely of health professionals. In 1992, the Government launched a
limited program to fight the epidemic, prepared a five-year HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and support plan,
and also held a resource mobilization meeting to fund the program. Pledges were received from a number of
donors, but the military coup in 1994 led to the suspension of aid flows. In 1995, the National AIDS
Committee was reconstituted as a multi-sectoral body, continuing under the Department of Health. It has
recently been replaced by a multi-sectoral, public and private sector National HIV/AIDS Council,
supported by a National HIV/AIDS Secretariat under the Office of the President.
2.4. It must be stressed that initial attitudes toward the HIV/AIDS epidemic has changed significantly. In
recent years, efforts to combat the WHV/AIDS epidemic have been conducted in a more open manner and
today a number of high government officials are seized with the problem and the dangers stemming from an
- 4 -



HIV/AIDS epidemic, are more vocal about these dangers, and recognize the risks to Gambia's future
development if a major and well-coordinated effort is not launched quickly to stem its spread. In sum, the
Government as a whole is conscious of the need to curtail the spread of the virus before it reaches an
explosive dimension, as has occurred in a number of SSA countries.
Government's Overall Development Strategies
2.5. The Government's long-term development strategy is principally articulated in "Vision 2020 - The
Gambia Incorporated" as well as the Strategy for Poverty Alleviation. The Government's goal is to
transform the country from its least developed country status into a middle-income one, through the
promotion of an economy based on exports of goods and services and the development of human resources.
The Government has also adopted a National Youth Policy, a National Education Policy, and a Strategy
for Local Government Reforms, each of which bear importantly on long-term development prospects. With
respect to the strategy for local government reforms, government line Departments and the funding of
activities are to be decentralized to local area councils, over time.
2.6. The Government is now fully aware that the HIV/AIDS epidemic might, if unchecked, jeopardize its
long-term development prospects. The basic strategic framework for HIV/AIDS is contained in the
National Health Policy: 1994-2000 "Improving Quality and Access" and is a major aspect of reproductive
health policy. Over the years, there has been increased multi-sectoral awareness and engagement in
HIV/AIDS prevention as evidenced by workshops, surveys on reproductive health behavior, and contacts
with youth, women groups, and religious leaders. Many activities have been promoted in conjunction with
the Government, principally by UN agencies and NGOs, to prevent and mitigate the spread of HIV/AIDS.
These activities have included limited information, education and communication (IEC) campaigns,
conferences, condom promotion, dissemination and use of HIV test kits, and sentinel surveillance activities.
However, these activities have neither been adequately funded nor coordinated.
Government HIV/AIDS Strategy
2.7 HIV/AIDS is referenced in a number of Government strategy documents and most recently in a national
consensus workshop on HIV/AIDS policy. The Gambian Development Forum on WIV/AIDS, held
November 2000 was a major step in furthering policy debate, discussion and action by Government, civil
society, religious leaders and others. In his opening address on November 1, 2000 Gambian President
A.J.J. Jammeh called on all Gambians to join him "in declaring war against HIV/AIDS, and to ensure that
The Gambia becomes totally free from this number one enemy to development and improved living
standards."
2.8 This reflects the recognition by the highest levels of the Gambian Government and civil society that
HWV/AIDS is a complex multi-faceted and multi-sectoral problem requiring long-term sustained responses
from all sectors of govemment and society. It is also fully consistent with the main program pillars
contained in the HARRP. The policy and strategic framework will continue to be developed through a
process of planning and program development at both the national and Divisional levels. This process will
engage national and regional governmental institutions, the major regional sector NGOs and religious
organizations, PLWHAs associations, and other key stakeholders. The goal will be to complete this effort
by mid-2001 and in September 2001 have it presented for adoption to the National Assembly (See Annex 7
"Key Implementation Steps, B. National HIV/AIDS Strategy and Action Plan"). The framework will focus
on reducing the transmission of HIV and associated morbidity and mortality as well as its impact on
individuals, families, and society at large.
-5-



2.9. This work will build on existing health, education, agriculture, youth, interior, defense, and tourism
plans of action and structures to implement key interventions for HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and support.
In the area of prevention, the strategic framework will examine, inter alia, the following areas for action:
*      Establish effective WHV/AIDS prevention and mitigation activities to curb the spread of the
epidemic;
*      Promote a broad, multi-sectoral response to HIV/AIDS, including more effective coordination and
resource mobilization, by government, NGOs, religious associations, the private sector, and communities;
*      Encourage government sectors, NGOs, the private sector, and communities to take measures to
alleviate the social and economic impact of HIV/AIDS;
*      Encourage a supportive institutional, home, and community-based health care and psychological
environment for Persons Living with IHV/AIDS (PLWHAs), orphans, and surviving dependents;
*      Safeguard the human rights of PLWHAs and avoid discrimination against them;
*      Empower women, youth, and other vulnerable groups at risk to take action to protect themselves
against HIV/AIDS;
*      Promote and encourage research activities targeted toward preventive, curative, and rehabilitative
aspects of HIV/AIDS, provide access to, and quality of, STIs, tuberculosis (TB), and HIV/AIDS
prevention, treatment and care (including opportunistic infections), and support services to meet the needs
of groups at increased risk of HIV infection;
*      Increase access to, and use of, voluntary testing and counseling activities;
*      Increase the provision of comprehensive STI/HIV/TB management in health care facilities;
*      Increase access to HIVAIDS education and communication;
*      Encourage delays in the onset of sexual activity among adolescents;
o      Promote reductions in the number of sexual partners;
*      Increase accessibility, availability, and use of condoms;
a      Promote information, education, and communications (IEC) as well as Behavioral Change
Communications (BCC) messages that are continuous, appropriate, acceptable, and effective in
inducing individual behavioral change;
*      Empower women and girls to reduce their risk of, and vulnerability to, HIV infection;
e      Prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission; and
*      Prevent WV transmission in hospital and health center settings.
In the area of care and support, this strategic framework would include, inter alia, the following activities:
*      Provide home/community-based and clinical care for PLWHAs;
*      Increase social support for PLWHAs and their families;
*      Establish an ethical, legal, and human rights framework for PLWHAs;
*      Expand and accelerate sector-specific interventions to mitigate HIV/AIDS impact; and
*      Increase HIV/AIDS operations research and surveillance.
2.10 Recognizing that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is an "emergency" and that time is of the essence, the
proposed project will focus on a relatively limited number of key priority activities with the maximum
potential for slowing the spread of the epidemic, thereby avoiding dispersal of energies and resources over
too wide range of actions in the short term. This fast-track project would therefore begin before completion
of any new strategy, while being a means to finance the ongoing strategic planning process. The
Government expects that if its comprehensive, multi-sectoral five year strategy and plan of action, receives
additional technical and financial support from the international community, the people and institutions of
- 6 -



The Gambia will have the capacity to contain the spread of the epidemic and its enormous burden on
society and the economy.
Synergies with Existing HIV/AIDS Activities
2.11. HARRP will build on activities already underway at various stages of implementation, including
those financed by the IDA-Participatory Health, Population and Nutrition Project (PHPNP), approved in
March 1998. Of particular note are the recently approved STI and HIV management manuals developed by
the DOSH and a technical advisory group. These manuals use the syndromic management approach and
are consistent with UNAIDS guidelines, providing the basic framework for a national approach for
prevention, treatment and care. PHPNP also supported revision of the mid-wifery curriculum, blood supply
donor mobilization, and improvements in primary and secondary health facilities. Under a complementary
health project financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB), a national public laboratory will provide
essential testing support for reproductive health activities.
2.12 Another program which is to be expanded with the help of the HARRP is the "Stepping Stones" effort
which has been supported by donor and technical assistance agencies both within and outside the UN
system. This community level, empowerment and participatory learning and action approach uses infertility
prevention as the acceptable pathway to discuss STIs and HIV prevention issues with traditional villages
and communities. Several local organizations including Action Aid, The Gambia Family Planning
Association, the German Gambia Family Planning Program, the Worldwide Evangelization for Christ, the
Medical Research Council and the DOSH have undertaken a collaborative effort, run under a joint
management structure, to pilot the approach. They have now developed the methodology and manuals and
tested it in several communities. This "Stepping Stones" approach has been partly evaluated and found
successful.
2.13 Other relevant ongoing activities include defining priority health indicators and the allocation of
resources in the health sector. HARRP is designed to channel government, donor, community, and other
partner resources, to a multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS prevention and care strategy and action plan. The
emphasis will be on interventions which can be implemented rapidly, targeting high risk and other target
groups, working as much or more outside the public sector, with communities and NGOs.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
3.1 The basic issue is how to prevent the spread of HIVAIDS in a multi-sectoral manner. The
Multi-country HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa Region (MAP) provides the framework to do so as well
as the concept for the HARRP. The Gamnbia is eligible for MAP funding in that it has satisfied the four
MAP eligibility criteria, namely:
(a)    Satisfactory evidence of a strategic approach to HIV/AIDS. Gambia has a strategic approach in
place and intends to improve and strengthen this approach through an intensive participatory process which
will culminate in a new medium term strategy and plan of action;
(b)    A high level HIV/AIDS coordinating body. The Gambia has created the National HIV/AIDS
Council under the Office of the President, with broad representation of key stakeholders from all sectors,
including people living with WV/AIDS. It has also established a National HIV/AIDS Secretariat under the
Office of the President to oversee implementation.
(c)    Government agreement to use appropriate implementation arrangements.  Government has
agreed to accelerate project implementation by channeling funds to communities and civil society. In
addition, Government has agreed to contract out financial management.
-7-



(d)    Government agreement to use and fund multiple implementation agencies. Government has
agreed to expand HIV/AIDS activities to a broad range of Departments, Divisions, Municipalities, as well
as to fund activities undertaken by non-government and community-based organizations and the private
sector.
3.2. HIV/AIDS is a complex, multifaceted, multisectoral problem requiring long term, sustained and
broad-based responses, including a range of activities involving virtually all levels and sectors of
government and society. Rapid spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic would have potentially damaging
consequences for several sectors, such as education, rural development/agriculture and the tourism
industry, that are key for the future development of The Gambia. However, each of these sectors could in
turn provide potential key contributions to the overall fight against HIV/AIDS. These contributions are
important and must be mobilized to achieve the overarching goal of the project which is to stem the spread
of the WIV/AIDS epidemic.
3.3 This fast-track project will begin with core activities that are ready for implementation. Support to
capacity building and policy development will help galvanize the fight against WV/AIDS and STIs, as well
as organize prevention and care activities in sectors and communities not yet engaged. Activities within the
various sectors will be geared to reaching the personnel and staff involved in these sectors and using them
as agents in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic. First, uniforn personnel and other public sector
staffs will be trained about HIV/AIDS and STI prevention, and care activities. Second, these staff will be
HIV/AIDS and STI prevention agents for the people they interact with. Sector staff will refer their
constituencies to HIV/AIDS and STI care services that will be provided by the health sector. Thirdly, these
HIV/AIDS and STI prevention agents, as community members, will advocate, contribute to, and
participate in community and civil society initiatives.
3.4. Taking the example of the education sector, this approach will work in the following manner: First,
teachers will be targeted for information, education and communication (IEC) and behavioral change
communications (BCC) programs. Teachers will be enrolled as key agents and role models in the fight
against HIV/AIDS and STIs. Second, students, when properly informed and educated about the dangers of
HIV/AIDS and STIs, will themselves become potent communicators of WHV-related prevention messages to
their age group peers, friends, parents, and the society at large. Teachers will promote behavioral change
messages through their interactions with the parents-teachers associations and other in-school and
out-of-school groups, constituencies, and organizations. Finally, Family Life Education (FLE) programs
will be expanded. While curricula in The Gambia already includes the teaching of FLE and therefore offers
a solid base on which to build, FLE is not mandatory at this juncture. As a result of the national HIV/AIDS
strategy process, this will be examined and the policy possibly changed. These types of activities are
primarily designed to reach adolescents in and out of schools.
3.5. Rural development is another area that has an important role to play in the concerted effort to inform
and motivate populations to prevent the spread of the virus. A rural development strategy is being
developed and it is planned that this strategy will take into account ways in which rural development
programs and rural development staff can incorporate and cooperate in the effort to prevent the spread of
HIV/AIDS. Currently there exists a wide array of agriculture and livestock services which can be brought
to bear in addressing HIWV/AIDS problems during their frequent interaction with rural communities.
3.6 The health sector in The Gambia has unique responsibilities and expertise. First, the health sector is
responsible for specific aspects of the campaign such as epidemiological oversight, testing, management of
the blood supply system and quality assurance, provision drugs for STI, TB, and other opportunistic
infections, and application of the STI syndromic management approach. The health sector must be the
- 8 -



supplier of, and assure that such services and/or products are available (no stock-outs), of good quality,
and affordable. Health personnel will be further trained in how to provide these services, counseling related
to these services, and/or products. Second, in The Gambia the health sector is organized at Divisional levels
with health centers that could serve as referral units to support HIV/AIDS activities carried out by other
sectors, non-governmental organizations, and communities. Third, health personnel must become key allies
in the fight against HV/AIDS, in its prevention and care dimensions. Overall, it is envisioned that health
services will not only play its customary service supply function, but also welcome and help patients
referred to it either by efforts in other sectors and/or by NGOs and communities. The DOSH is already
engaged in a variety of relevant communicable disease and reproductive health activities. These include the
provision of contraceptives, a tuberculosis program, as well as STIs testing and treatment. Such ongoing
efforts will be taken into account in the new undertakings.
3.7. Community involvement is of a crucial importance for this project (roughly half of the funds will
support community and civil society initiated activities through the "Community and Civil Society
Initiatives" component). Community activities are needed to support prevention (principally at this stage),
as well as care of those infected and affected. Such efforts will help empower communities at different
levels to heighten the level of awareness of their general population, fight discrimination against individuals
infected and/or affected by the WHV virus, and be an incentive for individuals to seek prevention and care
services when needed. Strong emphasis will be placed on counseling of both patients and families.
C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
1.1. The proposed project will have four components: 1) capacity building and policy development; 2)
multi-sectoral responses to prevention and care; 3) health sector responses to STIs and HIV/AIDS
management, including prevention and care; and 4) Community and Civil Society Initiatives. While
described in greater detail in subsequent sections, HARRP institutional arrangements are straightforward
and briefly described here: The National HIV/AIDS Council (NAC) and National HIV/AIDS Secretariat
(NAS) will be under the Office of the President. The NAC is the oversight body, the NAS is the
administrative, coordinating, and monitoring mechanism for the entire project. Using the existing
decentralization structures, namely the Divisional Coordinating Committees, sub-bodies called "Divisional
HIV/AIDS Committees" (DACs) will be established at Divisional (or Municipality equivalent) level. Line
Departments will receive funds to carry out sectoral H1IV/AIDS programs which will be supervised by their
designated focal points.
Component 1. Capacity Building and Policy Development (US$3.50 million)
1.2 This component would aim at strengthening Gambia's capacity to cope with the spread of HIV/AIDS
by supporting: (i) the work of the multi-sectoral National HWV/AIDS Council (NAC) and the Secretariat
(NAS), the Divisional/Municipal AIDS Committees (DACs), and small entities requesting proposal
preparation assistance; and (ii) the development of the national HWV/AIDS Strategy and Action Plan. Four
sub-components address the following areas: (a) National Strategy and Action Plan; (b) HARRP
Coordination and Administration, (c) Advocacy, Training, and Technical Support Activities, and (d)
Assessment, Monitoring and Evaluation (i.e. surveillance and mapping, operational research and pilot
testing, and other monitoring and evaluation activities). These sub-components are further detailed in
Annex 2, Project Description.
Component 2. Multi-sectoral Responses for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care (US$2.65 million)
-9-



1.3 This component will improve the capacity of non-health sector line Departments to respond to the
HIV/AIDS epidemic, emphasizing prevention and care. As part of their ongoing Departmental operations,
this will be achieved through development of Departmental policies, coupled with a two-prong action
approach, namely: (i) the provision to the line Department staff and their dependents of HIV/AIDS and
STIs education, training, condoms, and other support, to encourage HIV/AIDS and STIs avoidance
behavior; and (ii) the enhancement of the capacity of these staffs to provide their partners and audiences
(e.g. parents-teachers associations, farmers associations, village health committees) with means to provide
effective HIV/AIDS and STI prevention, and ways to access health care facilities and care. Interested line
Departments either have or will appoint HIV/AIDS focal persons to refine and carry out Departmental
policies and action plans, with support from HARRP in terms of facilities, equipment, and incremental
operating costs.
1.4 Currently the Departments of Education, Agriculture, Defense, Interior (Police, Prisons and Religious
Affairs), Youth, and Tourism, have such action plans in process and will be HARRP participants. Other
Departments may join after project effectiveness, subject to availability of Government, HARRP, or other
donor funds (The health sector is separately treated under Component-3 "Health Sector Responses to
STI/HIV Management").
1.5 Line Departments would have wide discretion in how they seek to achieve the two goals of: i)
Departmental staff HIV/AIDS and STI avoidance behavior, and ii) their staff reaching their constituencies
on HIV/AIDS and STI issues. Eligible line Department activities would depend on the content of interim
Departmental action plans for the first project year, some of which have already been developed. These
plans include appointment of Departmental focal points, provision for training, technical advisory services,
HIV/AIDS and STI IEC/BCC materials, VCT and condom distribution, and support for facilities and
equipment, including incremental operating costs to effectively carry out this effort. As mentioned, such
plans address both intemal groups (Departmental staff) and their external target groups on a phased basis.
Subsequently, the final National HIV/AIDS Strategy and Action Plan will refine the activities/instruments
of Departmental plans, and provide the basis for longer-term engagement.
(.omponent 3. Health Sector Responses to STI/HIV Management (US$1.85 million)
1.6 The Department of State for Health and Social Welfare (DOSH) and more broadly the health
community, have special responsibilities for STI and HIV/AIDS prevention and management. This sector
therefore warrants a separate component, making provision for prevention and care from a health sector
perspective, whether public or private. This component provides the resources to the health sector to build
on the framework of the HIV/AIDS and STI management manuals recently adopted by the DOSH, as well
as other reproductive health and communicable disease activities currently performed by the DOSH and its
health sector partners. Under this component, the DOSH will be able to do the activities described above
for other line Departments (WV/AIDS and STI avoidance behavior by its staff and dependents, and
reaching constituencies and external target groups). In addition DOSH can enhance its reproductive health
and opportunistic infection efforts with funds provided herein (especially those tested for HIV), recognizing
it will not be able to undertake all health sector specific tasks at once, nor do it without assistance from
other non-public health care providers. It will prioritize which aspects, where, when, and how quickly it can
implement and scale up its HIV/AIDS and STI management services. Using the experience and capacity of
the PHPNP, the procurement of condoms, opportunistic infection drugs, gloves and other medical supplies,
testing kits, and limited laboratory equipment is envisioned. Further, based on the model already in place in
one health facility (Brikama), reproductive health clinics will be installed in each of the Divisions, with
trained staff. A draft of the DOSH HIV/AIDS and STIs Action Plan is being refined. The basic features
- 10-



which differentiate the health sector from other sectors are those related to its medical functions such as
diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic infections such as STIs and TB, care at health posts, health
centers, and hospitals, and laboratory test assaying.
1.7 Two other aspects need highlighting with respect to the health sector: First, blood supply is important
and the enhancement of the blood supply system is being partly addressed under the PHPNP. In this regard,
the stated policy goal of The Gambia is that national blood supplies be controlled and assured as safe.
Blood donor mobilization is being financed under the PHPNP along with a readiness to cover preparation
costs of a plan for a national blood transfusion services, identify the necessary equipment to complement
what is being done under existing AfDB and IDA financing, what would be needed in terms of blood bags
and reagents, and training of laboratory technicians. The objective would be to ensure that blood for
transfusion and blood products do not transmit HIV and other infections. Second, there is need for
specialized training in HIV/AIDS and STI hazardous materials handling and provision of medical supplies
to health workers so as to prevent STI and HIV transmission. Health workers represent a particularly
vulnerable group because of their routine contact with hazardous materials, they are on the front line, and
need to be confident that their personal safety and well-being are taken into account so that they actively
promote testing of patients and care for PLWHAs. Further, inclusion of norms and standards for hazardous
waste disposal, appropriate to The Gambia, will be taken into account at all health facilities, along with
training of facility personnel in this regard.
1.8 The Bank has also been working closely with its UNAIDS partners, drug companies, and
developing-country governments on access to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. As the situation evolves,
individual Departments or Ministries of Health may explore ways of introducing ARV therapy. In The
Gambia, should the Government so decide, the HARRP will be able to support the development of
guidelines and the strengthening of health infrastructure to make the use of these drugs safe, effective and
sustainable. IDA will also actively follow up the trend in affordability and efficacy and remain open, on a
case-by-case basis, to supporting ARV drugs and the necessary infrastructure where resources may be
required.
Component 4. Community and Civil Society Initiatives (US$8.20 million)
1.9 "Community and Civil Society Initiatives" will be a financing mechanism to provide grant resources to
support community, civil society, worker associations, and "establishment or primary unit" initiatives
("establishments or primary units" are businesses, military camps, prisons, refugee camps, religious
groups, trade associations, sports clubs and the like). This component will therefore support both
"community-based" and "community-involved" activities. A Community and Civil Society Initiative
mechanism will be established by, and report to, the NAC, through the NAS. A nominal initial allocation
will be made to the five Divisions (and two municipalities) on a population density basis, so that there is
proportionate sharing and an indicative planning amount from which to begin work. (See also Annex 2
"Project Description" for more details). These allocated ceilings will be adjusted based on experience and
performance.
1.10 Eligible Applicants. Applications to the Community and Civil Society Initiatives (CCSI) can be
submitted to the DACs directly by the community or community association, a private entity, or by
collaborators (NGOs, consortiums) on their behalf. An NGO or other organization can consolidate a
number of smaller proposals to create a medium sized proposal, and submit it to the DAC. In addition, a
national, multi-Divisional, or divisional concept/program benefiting communities which are a priori not
identifiable, may be approved for funding under this component, provided the concept/program meets
CCSI's pre-established eligibility criteria. Basically there will be three types of proposals submitted by
- 11 -



eligible organizations (ranging from NGOs, CBOs, VDCs, PLWHAs, associations, the private sector and
the like) for approval: (i) large scale "Category A" activities with National, Multi-Divisional, or Divisional
coverage which will require substantial experience, and institutional capacity, and for which entities will be
pre-qualified; (ii) medium-small scale "Category B" activities which will require considerably lesser
standards of capacity; and (iii) "Category C" activities proposed by communities (CBOs and VDCs
inclusive) on their own behalf. Qualified Category B and C applicants will be able to obtain modest grant
assistance from the HARRP for local consultant support to help in preparing proposals and organizational
training, if need be.
I. I I Activities Eligible for Funding. Project proposals will be considered based on an HIV/AIDS Activity
Positive List which will be further defined in an IDA approved, Community and Civil Society Initiatives
Operations Manual. Assuming a qualified applicant puts forward a proposal consistent with the
menu/positive list, it would be presumed to be eligible for financing. Community and Civil Society
Initiatives' activities would inter alia address the following areas: (i) information education and
communication/behavioral change communications (IEC/BCC) campaigns; (ii) support to high-risk groups;
(iii) youth-related activities; (iv) condom supply and dissemination. (This "illustrative" list is not intended
to limit the scope of activities that may become eligible for funding under this component.). CCSI would
therefore use various ongoing means to mobilize and attract target groups to discuss and decide how to
prevent HIV/AIDS. Examples of such common interest social activities could include gardening, literacy
and local crafts.
1.12. CCSI Subproject approval process. CCSI subproject proposal applications can be submitted to the
DACs directly by the community or community association, a private entity, or, by collaborators (NGOs,
consortiums), on their behalf. An NGO or other organization can consolidate a number of smaller projects,
or a medium size project, and submit it to the DAC. All large projects will be submitted to the NAS for
rapid appraisal and approval. Projects approved at the Divisional/municipal level will not go through any
re-approval process at the NAS level. However, the NAS will have oversight responsibility as to the quality
and compliance of such projects in responding to HARRP objectives. With respect to activities of national
scope, whether proposed by civil society, NGOs, associations, research institutions, or a consortium of
these groups, these would be reviewed and approved by the NAS and NAC. The details of the proposal
approval process, the financial approval thresholds, and the timelines to notify applicants and their options
if the proposal is not accepted will be described in the CCSI Operations Manual.
I.13. Institutional Arrangements. Various institutional options were considered, including contracting the
Gambia Social Development Fund financed by the African Development Bank, channeling all resources to
the decentralized rural development structures supported by the European Development Fund (Support to
Decentralized Rural Development) and which use multi-disciplinary facilitation teams, or utilizing the
Local Initiative Fund (LIF) approved in 1998 under the PHPNP. After due consideration the Gambian
Govemment determined its preference would be to use multiple channels for developing and presenting
proposals, and to rely on Divisional/municipal AIDS Committees and the NAS to process applications for
approval and monitoring activities. The existing mechanisms were found not to be the "right fit", either
because they were principally micro-financing credit operations in an early testing mode having limited
geographic coverage and more infrastructure-oriented, had other priorities, had long appraisal or
developmental timelines, or already had much to do with their current plans and programs. The Community
and Civil Society Initiatives system will be demand driven, will complement existing mechanisms in many
cases, and will allow the full gamut of potential users to access resources. It is also expected that regular
working meetings will be held with the different funding entities such as the Social Development Fund,
SDRD, and LIF, to share experience, work to complement each other rather than compete for clients, and
consider how these entities might serve as delegated CCSI agents to expand HARRP outreach.

1. 14. The selected approach will require supplemental staff for the NAS and DACs as described in
Component I sub-component "(b) HARRP Program Coordination and Administration". With the further
clarification of the Community and Civil Society Initiatives Operations Manual before operations begin, the
full extent of supplemental staff needs will be known. At this juncture at the DAC level, only a HARRP
Facilitator is contemplated.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
2.1 The Project will assist in carrying out a comprehensive national HIV/AIDS Strategy and Plan of
Action. By supporting the National HIV/AIDS Council and Secretariat in the Office of the President it
represents recognition that this is a multi-sectoral issue, and that the Government has taken leadership in
engaging public and private institutions to do common cause against this threat.
3. Benefits and target population:
3.1 The project will:
*      Improve individual and household ability to prevent HIV/AIDS and/or mitigate the effects of the
epidemic;
*      Reduce HIV and STIs incidence through emphasis on safe sex practices, better diagnosis and
treatment of opportunistic infections for PLWHAs; and
*      Improve community responses and local empowerment to mitigate and/or respond to the potential
impact of the spread of HIV/AIDS.
3.2 The project would directly benefit three groups, namely those with high-risk behavior, a priority target
- 13 -



group, and the general population. The high-risk group is comprised of commercial sex workers and their
clients, truck drivers or long distance transport personnel, and migrant workers, and those already infected.
The priority target group is comprised of women, youths aged 15-24, orphans, and line Department
personnel such as educators, health workers, the tourist industry and personnel in uniform (military, police,
customs, immigration, firemen). This priority target group was chosen because either they constitute the
more vulnerable, with coping mechanisms for households stretched to the limit, or represent a crucial
human resource and/or delivery channel of information and attitudes, which have particular impact on the
success of an HIV/AIDS prevention program. Although the general population or community is at lower
risk of HIV/AIDS infection, it will greatly benefit in its own right from the information campaigns, and
better access to HIV and STI prevention services and supplies such as condoms. All Gambians will benefit
indirectly from the project's efforts to combat the spread of WHV/AIDS and to strengthen the country's
ability to respond to the epidemic, thereby mitigating the social and economic impact of the disease.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
4.1. Implementing agencies and Coordination. Project coordination responsibilities will be carried out by
the various implementing agencies at the administrative levels:
(i)    At the national level, the National HWV/AIDS Council (NAC) and National HWV/AIDS Secretariat
(NAS) will be under the Office of the President. The NAC is the policy formulation and the oversight body
(national WHV/AIDS Strategy and Plan of Action) with equal participation of the government and the civil
society and will be the overall accountable entity for the Project. The NAS will be the coordinating and
administrative body reporting to NAC, and will be responsible for (a) operational coordination ( line
Departments of State, divisional/municipality authorities, NGOs, associations,  the private sector,
donors/UN agencies and the like), (b) overall implementation monitoring and evaluation, (c) financial
management through a private sector financial management firm/agent, and (d) procurement management.
NAS will also coordinate major national level sensitization and mobilization workshops and seminars. It
will also constitute any needed technical committee, as directed by the NAC for technical evaluations
and/or planning. Line Departments of State will receive funds to carry out sectoral WHV/AIDS programs
which will be supervised by their designated focal points. These participating line Departments will prepare
and submit annual work plans (AWP) to the NAS as well as monthly progress reports (including financial).
(ii)    At the Divisional or Municipality levels, the project will use the existing decentralized structures,
namely the Divisional Coordinating Committees (DCC). Under the project, divisional (or municipality
equivalent) committees on WHV/AIDS will be established as a sub-committee of the DCC and each will be
designated as a "Divisional HIV/AIDS Committee" (DAC). Committee members will select the
chairperson of the DAC for a one-year period on a rotational basis. The DACs will have roughly equal
membership from Government (line Departments and local government) and civil society (NGOs, women,
youth, the private sector, PLWHAs. PLWHAs must be represented). DACs will convene monthly to focus
on the proposals submitted under the CCSI for project appraisal and implementation coordination. DACs
will prepare and submit monthly progress reports to NAS on project implementation progress. They will
also be expected to visit Community and Civil Society Initiative sites. DACs will be responsible to mobilize
its 'member' frontline staffs to coordinate activities at the community level in accordance with the CCSI
Operations Manual. The project will finance HARRP Facilitators at each Division (or municipality
equivalent) who would (a) promote the CCSI, (b) advise the DAC on the project cycle, (c) help in screening
and presenting proposals, and (d) assist in monitoring CCSI approved activities.
(iii)   At the Community level, the participating community organizations will be responsible for CCSI
-14 -



activities implementation with support from CBOs, NGOs, private sector and various groups from the civil
society. Community groups will be responsible for implementing community subprojects that qualify for
funding in accordance with HARRP principles of transparency, participation and supervision/ monitoring.
4.2. Project Management/Administration. NAS will develop and implement a Project Operations Manual,
which will cover components 1-3, and a separate manual for CCSI (component-4). A preliminary draft of
the CSCI Operations Manual has been prepared. These manuals will clearly highlight the procedures,
rules/regulations, processes, formats, responsibilities and timelines for the administration of the project at
the national, divisional and the community levels.
4.3. Financial management, reporting and auditing arrangements (see Annex 6): A financial management
capacity assessment was performed during project preparation and appraisal. The report can be found in
project files. It covers the project's overall financial management arrangements at all levels including NAS,
line Departments, DAC and CCSI grants beneficiaries. The findings of the assessment are taken into
account in the design of the project financial management system to ensure that it meets both the project's
needs and World Bank requirements.
4.4. Financial Management: The design of the financial management arrangements will aim at ensuring
both timely and reliable flow of funds to the implementing entities at all levels. For this purpose, the
financial management of the project at the central level will be contracted out to a private Financial
Management Agent (FMA). This contract will be initially for two years, at which time it will be jointly
reviewed by the Government and IDA to determine if it is necessary to continue financial management
outsourcing. The FMA will be responsible for carrying out all matters related to the financial management
of the project under the supervision of NAS. Terms of reference for the selection of the FMA specify that
the selected firm will set up the project's financial management system (including development of the
Project Operations Manual and the installation of financial management software) and provide technical
support including training and posting an adequate number and mix of staff at NAS on a permanent basis
to facilitate the collation of financial statements received from the various implementing entities. As
instructed by NAS, FMA will manage the principal HARRP accounts, disbursements of funds from them,
such as advances, replenishments of advances, payments to NAS goods and service providers. In
collaboration with the NAS, FMA will also assist the accounting units of participating line Departments
and the DACs (or Municipality equivalent) in properly maintaining the project accounts.
4.5. The financial management arrangements for this project will build on existing accounting units within
line Departments, municipal councils and the geographic Divisions, under the responsibility of NAS which
will be assisted by the financial management agent (FMA). The Project's Operations Manual will describe
financial management, reporting and internal control procedures applicable within the line Departments and
DACs. It should be noted that with respect to the Community and Civil Society Initiatives, the approval of
proposals would be the responsibility of the NAS and DACs (or Municipality equivalent), while
disbursement will be separate and overseen by the relevant accounting units and the FMA. To address
financial management capacity weaknesses within the line Departments and DAC, training will be provided
to accountants involved in the financial management of the Project as part of the FMA terms of reference.
In addition, funds will be disbursed by NAS/FMA for line Departments expenses based on approved
annual budgets and payment requests sent to NAS by the line Departments; payment requests will be
approved only after appropriate controls by NAS/FMA.
4.6. Reporting: Each of the line Departments, DAC secretariats and the NAS will prepare Annual Work
Programs (AWP), including disbursement forecasts. All Annual Work Programs will be consolidated by
the NAS into the project's overall Annual Work Program. Based on AWPs, each line Department and DAC
Secretariat will prepare quarterly reports. The Financial Management Agent will prepare NAS quarterly
- 15 -



reports and consolidate all individual reports in the project's overall quarterly reports, including financial,
procurement and physical progress. Beneficiaries of Community and Civil Society Initiatives will be
expected to report on their expenses before their advances are replenished. The Project Operations Manual
will further elaborate on reporting requirements, including format and timing.
4.7. Audit requirements: The financial statements of the project will be audited for each fiscal year by an
independent auditor acceptable to IDA in accordance with standards on auditing also acceptable to IDA.
Audit reports of reasonable scope and detail would be submitted to IDA within six months from the end of
the audited period. The auditor will provide an opinion on i) the project financial statements (statement of
Source and Application of Funds and Balance sheet); ii) the statement of expenditures (SOE); and iii) the
Special Account (SA). The auditor will also issue a separate management report on Intemal Controls and
operational procedures outlining any recommendations for improving intemal accounting controls and
operational procedures identified as a result of the financial statement audit. The audit will also cover
controls on the monthly expenditure reports submitted by line Departments and DACs. Audits of the
community and other local implementing entities will be performed on a random sample basis. In addition,
all sub-projects financed for an amount greater than the equivalent of US$50,000 (this amount will be
subject to review and change, depending on project performance), will be systematically audited and
reported on by the auditors. The auditor's report should be submitted to IDA no later than six months after
the end of a fiscal year.
4.8. Procurement arrangements: Major procurement such as vehicles, office and medical
equipment/supplies will be handled by the NAS. Procurement of items costing less than US$20,000 related
to IEC/BCC materials, workshops, training, and operations will be handled by the line Departments and
DACs (or Municipality equivalent) using the specified procurement methods identified for the project. This
limit may be revised according to experience and performance. Ownership of the signed contracts will be
with respective line Departments including contract management.
4.9. With respect to CCSI activities, the project will encourage contracting technical advisory and capacity
building services to private entities including NGOs and similar institutions that have experience working
with rural communities. The detailed planning, design, and execution of subprojects will also be contracted
out to similar entities. NAS will establish the process for identifying and contracting service providers,
based on needs. A large part of the project's training programs will also be contracted out, as well as
impact and performance studies, surveys, operations research and beneficiary assessments.
4. 10. Disbursement arrangements: Specific disbursement procedures will be developed for the HARRP to
address the need for rapid response. The key considerations defined for the Multi-country HIV/AIDS
Program will apply to the HARRP. These considerations are: a) a link between physical progress and
project expenditure, b) the need for a sufficient balance in the Special Account to cover decentralized and
emergency activities, and c) an efficient and effective flow of funds to meet the needs of the project during a
relatively short implementation period. Funds will be disbursed from the IDA to a single Special Account
administered by the Financial Management Agent at the central level on behalf of the NAS. The initial
deposit to the Special Account will cover IDA estimated financing for the first six months of project
implementation. An advance account will be opened for each line Department and each DAC in which an
advance will be made from the Special Account, and subsequently replenished. Disbursement of funds to
the individual communities will be done from the Divisional/municipal accounts following the approval of
the sub-projects. For larger sub-projects, disbursement can be done directly from the Special Account to
the beneficiaries account given the large amounts involved.

4.1 1. Use of PMR-based disbursement method: The overall project financial management system will
include Project Management Reporting (PMR) capability from the beginning of project implementation. It
will, however, follow traditional disbursement methods during an 18-month interim period while PMR
capacity is being developed, and this includes strengthening of financial management capacity at all levels.
In any case, it is difficult to make accurate cash forecasts, particularly for the first year, given the nature of
the project. Quarterly PMR reports, including financial, procurement and physical progress reports, will
be prepared as soon as the Project starts. Within the interim period of 18 months, PMR capacity will be
reviewed and a determination made as to Project readiness to shift fully PMR-based disbursement. In sum,
the Project is expected to operate under PMR-based disbursement at the end of the 18-month interim
period, while will following traditional disbursement methods in the interim period.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
1. I See Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa Region Project Appraisal Document (Report No.
20727 AFR), paragraphs 67-69 as to the reasons for selecting the MAP approach. With respect to The
Gambia specifically, one option considered was to simply supplement the work being done under the
Participatory Health, Population and Nutrition Project in reproductive health. However, it was not felt this
would be the most effective solution, given the multi-dimensional nature of the HIV/AIDS problem, the
need to move flexibly and rapidly at community level, and taking into account the demands already placed
on the Department of State for Health.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
3.1 Stakeholder Consultation; Key stakeholders, particularly those with an important role in
implementation, should be involved from project identification, through preparation and appraisal, and
throughout implementation. The project has been prepared in consultation with both implementers and
donor agencies, working within the framework of the preparatory process for the HIV/AIDS National
Strategy and Plan of Action. The Joint Statements of the UNAIDS Agencies of August 2, 2000 and on
November 28, 2000 by representatives of WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNDP, the World Bank and
UNAIDS Secretariat reflects the high level of cooperation and collaboration.
3.2 Procurement capacity is often a weak point in achieving rapid project implementation. Therefore
provision has been made to finance a Procurement Specialist and procurement consultancy support under
the project (a procurement agency would not be appropriate for this project in view of the limited
procurement under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures).
3.3 Financial Management: Particularly given the new structures, it is important to have both sound
financial management and clear accountability for both the Government and external financing. Stress has
been put on this during preparation and it is reflected in agreement to employ a financial management
agent.
3.4 Implementing across Departments: Past experience has demonstrated difficulties in implementing
projects across multiple Departments. Obviously a multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS project must engage a number
of line Departments and local government mechanisms. The risks inherent in this arrangement will be
mitigated by the fact that the project will be "coordinated" in the Office of the President. Such high level
coordination will give the HARRP sufficient authority to facilitate timely resolution of bureaucratic
difficulties which might arise.
3.5 Coordinating Body vs. Managing or Implementing Agency: Experience in other situations has shown
the danger of a "so-called" coordinating body overstepping its role and attempting to undertake
implementation. This results in numerous implementation problems, and turf conflict. Both the Government
of The Gambia and IDA have kept this issue at the forefront of discussions on the establishment of the
National HIV/AIDS Secretariat; it will have coordinating, administration and monitoring and evaluation
functions, but it will not implement programs.
3.6 Additional lessons learned from IDA financed projects in The Gambia and Bank activities elsewhere,
and which guided HARRP development include: (i) where there are limited resources and HIV/AIDS
prevalence is low, a focused approach is more likely to be successful; (ii) high level official--and
continuing--commitment to the fight against HIV/AIDS, is essential; (iii) large scale condom promotion and
marketing should result in large increases in condom use; (iv) WHV/AIDS is not a "health sector" problem
alone, but requires a multi-sector effort ; (v) NGOs, CBOs and the private sector should play significant
roles in HIV prevention and care.
- 19 -



4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The Government has formally advised the Bank of its commitment to undertake an extraordinary effort to
contain the spread of the virus. This is fully articulated in the President of the Gambia's address of November 1,
2000 at the National Development Forum in which he specifically commits the country to a war against
HV/AIDS. Also, The Gambia has held a series of workshops and planning meetings to sensitize policy and
decision makers, civil society, geographic regions, donors, community representatives, and PLWHAs, and
to seek guidance, build ownership, and encourage local initiatives. (Senior Policy Makers in Government,
the Private Sector and NGO Workshop (2 days)-June 2000; Youth AIDS Forum-September 2000; Line
Department Focal Point Workshop (2 days)-September, 2000; NGO Sensitization Meeting-October 2000;
National Development Forum on WIV/AIDS-November 2000). The Government intends to formulate and
adopt a more comprehensive National WHV/AIDS Strategy, and a National AIDS Council (NAC) is being
established under the Office of the President. Further, there is agreement to staff a secretariat under the
NAC to support the HARRP. The Government has firmly indicated it is prepared to provide the necessary
counterpart for the WHV/AIDS Rapid Response Project despite severe budgetary constraints, and, to include
it in the CY2001 Budget. It has agreed to the annual program review approach, inviting other partners
and/or potential partners to contribute to its final National HIV/AIDS Strategy and Action Plan.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Multi-country HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa Region places HIV/AIDS at the center of the
development agenda for work in the region. For the individual country, but also for neighboring countries
and communities, the curtailment of the spread of HIV is pivotal if human development and overall
development goals are to be achieved. WHV/AIDS prevention is cross-sectoral and the Bank has experience
in financing selected sectors in The Gambia, each of which has a key role to play in carrying forward an
HIV/AIDS prevention program (agriculture, education, health, the private sector). Further, the Bank has
embarked with the Government and the IMF on a Poverty Reduction Strategy exercise, and this effort will
take HIV/AIDS concerns into account. With its IPAA partners, the Bank has experience in the design of
HIV/AIDS rapid response programs in other countries, and in supporting successful programs in West
Africa. Of significance for The Gambia, because its land is in the midst of Senegal, are Senegal's active
HIV/AID prevention programs, where the HIV prevalence rate is, and has been kept, at 2.2%. IDA is one
of the few UJNAIDS partners in a position to make a multi-year commitment to the long-term Gambian
effort to avert an WHV/AIDS disaster. The HARRP will be relied upon as an important platform and
resource in carrying out the broader National HIV/AIDS Plan of Action and Strategy.

Fiscal Impact:
See paragraph 79 of the Project Appraisal Document for the Multi-country HIV/AIDS Program for the
Africa Region (Report No. 20727 AFR). Furthermore, with the large amount of resources directed at
community interventions, reliance on NGOs, CBOs, the outsourcing of financial management and some
aspects of monitoring, small additional staff for the NAS/DACs, the recurrent cost impact of the program
should be manageable.
3. Technical:
a) Project Implementation:
3.1 This project has incorporated the best internationally accepted practices for HIV/AIDS responses as
defined in the MAP and by UNAIDS partners. HARRP has tailored these general principles to the
Garnbia-specific context and will follow the currently best accepted practices in technical standards for
health infrastructure, including the handling of medical supplies and medical waste to minimize any
environmental impact. Line Departments will be involved in the preparation of components to ensure their
consistency with national technical standards. Further, HARRP will draw on Gambian experience and
approaches with other IDA projects as to any civil works.
b) Project supervision
3.2 In view of the project risks and the number of implementing and coordinating partners, from the central
to Divisional to constituency level, World Bank implementation support and supervision activities are
envisaged to be more intensive than customary. On a regular basis, support and supervision activities will
be the responsibility of the World Bank Senegal Bank Office involving a task team leader, senior health
specialist, financial management specialist, rural development specialist, and procurement specialist.
3.3 Back-up support in Washington would involve a team comprised of senior operations specialist and an
HIV/AIDS specialist. HARRP reporting and the annual review process, including work plans and budgets,
will allow for mid-course corrections. During supervision the Task Team will pay special attention to, and
act upon, any need to formally restructure or "re-work" the Project to reflect "learning by doing". Given the
nature of HARRP and its preparation, there is need for intensive supervision during the first two years of
operation, and thus resources will be made available to support Bank-based supervision at a level
substantially higher than for conventional projects.
3.4 In addition to the regular implementation support and supervision of the project, annual reviews will be
organized involving all those involved in the HIIV/AIDS partnership in The Gambia, conceivably organized
by the UNAIDS Theme Group. These reviews will focus on the achievements made and constraints faced
in the development of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and Action Plan, and in preparation of the
work-program and budget for the subsequent year.
c) Procurement Procedures
3.5 IDA will finance goods, civil works, consultancy, training, and other local activities necessary to
implement the project. Procurement for all IDA-financed activities will be carried out in accordance with

6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
See paragraph 83 of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa Region (Report No. 20727
AFR) and treatment in other sections of this PAD. The project will have major effect in destigmatizing
those people who are infected or affected by HlV/AIDS.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
The project concept was developed in a highly participatory manner. Key stakeholders have been integral
participants in the HARRP design preparation and will have key roles to play in its implementation, and
will be part of the National HlV/AIDS Council.
6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
NGOs and other civil society organizations are and will be engaged in both the formulation of the National
HIV/AIDS strategy as well as among the principal applicants for activities to be financed under
Community and Civil Society Initiatives. CCSI comprises roughly 50 percent of the IDA credit, and is
based on the premise of community involvement.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
Annual meetings, as well as stakeholder workshops are envisioned to review progress in meeting key
indicators, among which are that 90% of the population aged 15-49 are aware of HIV/AIDS transmission
modes and the means of prevention by the end of the project period.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance in terms of social development outcomes?
Component I "Capacity Building and Policy Development", sub-component "(d) Assessment, Monitoring
and Evaluation" describes the monitoring approach as does Annex-Il on "Monitoring and Evaluation"
contained in this document.

7.2 Describe provisions made by the project to ensure compliance with applicable safeguard policies.
The highest levels of The Gambian Government and civil society recognize that HIV/AIDS is a complex
-23 -



multi-faceted and multi-sectoral problem that requires a long-term sustained response from all sectors of
Government and society if they are to safeguard the nation, and its future. Sensitivity to cultural differences
will be taken into account as the National HIV/AIDS Strategy is refined, and as HIV/AIDS prevention
measures are brought on stream.
F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
HARRP sustainability will depend on the degree to which the National HIV/AIDS strategy and
HARRP activities become fully owned and appreciated by the various partners at national, divisional, and
local levels; their implementation capacity, including their ability to organize for sub-project activities and
carry them out; their ability to access funds and use them in accordance with agreed plans. Because most
activities involve communities in some way, the prospects for sustained interest will be enhanced if
HARRP is able to respond to beneficiary targeted priorities, and do so without extensive delay or
bureaucratic requirements. Training is a focus in virtually all aspects of the HARRP, from line
Departments to NGOs, from financial administration to IEC/BCC, and this will further enhance prospects
of sustainable performance, interest, and support.
2. Critical Risks (reflecting the failure of critical assumptions found in the fourth column of Annex 1):

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
As indicated in the Multi-country HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa Region (Report No. 27027 AFR) no
aspects of the MAP approach are likely to spark external controversy. In The Gambia, the commitment to
undertake this multi-sectoral intensive effort means that, if successful, it will require ongoing support, and
this implies a long-term commitment from the Bank and the international community. The willingness to
provide grants in future by other donors would help to assuage such concerns. Further, the degree to which
sensitive and personal issues are to be addressed could create concern with some religious groups and
cultures. By involving stakeholders experienced in dealing with these sensitivities it is expected that such
cultural barriers will be overcome in locally appropriate ways.
G. Main Credit Conditions
1. Effectiveness Conditions
Conditions of Effectiveness are intended to be minimal in order to ensure a swift progression from Board
presentation to effectiveness. Many outstanding issues were addressed as conditions for appraisal.
Conditions of Effectiveness are:
(a) Opening the Project Account and deposit of the initial amount;
(b) Appointment of the NAS Director with terms of reference and qualifications acceptable to IDA;
(c) Appointrnent of a Financial Management Agent and establishment of an accounting and financial
management system satisfactory to IDA; and
(d) Finalization of the Project Implementation Plan, a draft Procurement Plan for the first year and the
Project Operations Manual in form and substance satisfactory to IDA.
2. Other [classify according to covenant types used in the Legal Agreements.]
A Condition of Disbursement of Credit proceeds under Component 4, is that an Operations Manual for
activities to be financed under the Community and Civil Society Initiatives has been adopted, satisfactory
to IDA.
H. Readiness for Implementation

L 3. The Project Implementation Plan has been appraised and found to be realistic and of satisfactory
quality.
1] 4. The following items are lacking and are discussed under loan conditions (Section G):
Given the urgent nature of objectives of the HARRP and the need to be innovative with institutional
arrangements and flow-of-funds procedures, project activities-are programmed for early implementation so
that the process of "learning-by-doing" begins at once. In addition to more intensive supervision in the
initial six months than customary, there will be annual reviews of prior year experience, presentation of the
following year's work plan and budget, and meetings with existing and potential partners to brief them on
progress and to revise the financing of activities to include new contributions.
Annex 7 provides key implementation steps in two regards:
a)    Through Project Launch. Project Implementation Plan, first year Procurement Plan, Project
Operations Manual; opening of the Project Bank account and initial deposit; and Project Launch. These are
expected to be completed in March 2001;
b)     Preparation of National HIV/AIDS Strategv and Action Plan: Review of existing policies;
preparation of thematic papers; consensus building process; adoption by the National Assembly,
engagement of existing and potential partners. These are expected to be completed in September 2001.

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
THE GAMBIA: HIV/AIDS Rapid Response Project
The HARRP will have four components, namely: 1) capacity building and policy development; 2)
multi-sectoral responses to prevention and care; 3) health-sector responses to HI V/AIDS and STI
management, including prevention and care; and 4) Community and Civil Society Initiatives. HARRP
institutional arrangements are straightforward and briefly described here: The National HIV/AIDS Council
(NAC) and National HIV/AIDS Secretariat (NAS) will be under the Office of the President. The NAC is
the oversight body, the NAS is the administrative, coordinating, and monitoring mechanism for the entire
project. Using the existing decentralization structures, namely the Divisional Coordinating Committees
(DCC), sub-bodies called "Divisional HlV/AIDS Committees" (DACs) will be established at the Divisional
level. Line Departments will receive funds to carry out sectoral WHV/AIDS programs which will be
supervised by their designated focal points.
By Component:
Project Component I - US$3.50 million
Capacity Building and Policy Development
1.1. This component will aim at strengthening Gambia's capacity to cope with the spread of WIV/AIDS by
supporting: (i) the work of the multisectoral National WIV/AIDS Council (NAC) and the Secretariat
(NAS), the Divisional/Municipal AIDS Committees (DACs), and small entities requesting proposal
preparation assistance; and (ii) the development of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and Action Plan. Four
sub-components address the following areas: (a) National Strategy and Action Plan; (b) HARRP
Coordination and Administration; (c) Advocacy Training, and Technical Support Activities; and (d)
Assessment, Monitoring and Evaluation (i.e., surveillance and mapping, operational research and pilot
testing, and other monitoring and evaluation activities).
(a) National Strategy and Action Plan. A process to prepare and adopt first an interim followed by a
medium-term comprehensive National WIV/AIDS Strategy and Action Plan by September 2001, is
contemplated. Preparation of the National Strategy and Action Plan will entail a review of existing relevant
national policies and programs, development of papers on specific themes, and a consensus building
exercise. It will cover both specific technical aspects (the responsibility of the appropriate entity such as the
DOSH in the case of health) and multi-sectoral areas of policy, such as education, rural development,
youth, tourism, defense, rights protection of those infected with, and/or affected by, WV/AIDS, and
proposals to strengthen or amend appropriate legislation and administrative rules. The Action Plan will be
developed concurrently with the preparation of the Strategy, engaging many stakeholders and donors, and
then circulated to appropriate partners for financial and technical support. The Strategy and Action Plan
would be vetted at Divisional workshops, comprised of both Government and civil society, for comment
and revision (As part of the Key Implementation Steps for Project Year I, a processing schedule is
contained in Annex 7 B.).
(b) HARRP Program Coordination and Administration. Because of the developmental and multi-sectoral
nature of the HARRP, the national coordinating/administering secretariat will be under the Office of the
President. At Divisional and municipal level HARRP will be administered by Divisional (or equivalent)
AIDS Committees with limited HARRP-financed staff appointed to carry out the additional duties created
by HARRP. NAS/DAC will rely on line Departments, decentralized government mechanisms at Divisional
and Municipality level, and NGOs, CBOs and the private sector ("establishments") to implement
WIV/AIDS prevention and care programs. A financial management agent (firm) will be contracted to
accelerate and assure efficient resource transfers, financial reporting and monitoring.
- 32 -



Broadly speaking NAS/DAC tasks will be program promotion and coordination (including national
strategy development, Community and Civil Society Initiatives activities, training and IEC), organizing and
arranging workshops and meetings, contracting for studies and surveys, providing technical advice and
training support to others implementing the HARRP such as NGOs, as well as in monitoring, procurement,
and financial management. Sub-components a), c) and d) will be coordinated or administered in varying
degrees by the NAS, which reports to the NAC. HARRP will provide the necessary institutional financial
support for the NAS including key professional staff, office space, office equipment, transportation,
logistical support, maintenance and operating costs. For each of the five Divisions and two Municipalities,
HARRP/DAC support will include strengthening existing capacity, and as required, an appropriate
HIARRP facilitator and equipment, office supplies, transportation and incremental operating costs similar
to that to be provided to the NAS. The strengthening of the DACs will support and encourage the Gambian
Government's decentralization initiatives.
(c) Advocacy, Training, and Technical Support Activities. This sub-component would be geared to
conveying, to the highest levels of Gambian leadership (e.g., religious and traditional leaders, unions, the
business community, military and police, educators, the tourism industry, the private sector), the need to be
aware of, and to scale up, program activities to stem the expansion of the virus. Various media channels,
whether rural radio, theatre groups, traditional singers, TV or newspapers will be involved in the advocacy
efforts. The objective would be to have them actively promote HIV/AIDS prevention, destigmatization and
care. It would similarly promote HARRP awareness at Divisional and Municipality levels, and in reaching
the general public. Efforts would include multi-media campaigns, ongoing fora for youth, workshops, peer
education, short-term training, study tours, and conference participation in meetings related to HlV/AIDS
prevention and care. Various HARRP constituencies, such as line Departments, unions, NGOs and NGO
associations, CBOs, and private establishments would receive training and technical advice/assistance.
NAS would have both a coordinating function to assure basic consistency across components, and also
under certain circumstances, a more direct role with respect to provision of training and advocacy.
(d) Assessment, Monitoring and Evaluation. This sub-component includes surveillance and mapping,
operational research and pilot testing, as well as project monitoring and evaluation activities. Surveillance
and mapping activities include the design and execution of: (i) an expanded STI/HIV sentinel surveillance
system (to at least eight sentinel sites); (ii) behavioral surveys on specific topics such as adolescent sex
behavior, on different groups such as religious communities, refugees, as well as regular Knowledge,
Attitude and Practice (KAP) surveys; (iii) mapping of high risk groups and identification of hot/cool spots;
(iv) investigation of different strains of the HIV virus present in The Gambia in collaboration with research
institutes; (v) support for a national epidemiological survey of HIV/STIs, if needed; and (vi) using
available Geographic Information System (GIS) capacity to monitor trends.
Operational research and pilot testing activities of this sub-component would fund applied research geared
at the improvement, expansion, evaluation and/or fine-tuning of prograrnmatic interventions. IIARRP
would support operational research aimed at the validation and/or implementation of multi-sectoral
approaches to combat the epidemic, and the development of methodologies for The Gambia to analyze
relative costs and benefits of different HIV/AIDS interventions. In addition, pilot testing of innovative
approaches such as those related to behavioral change communication resulting in safe sex behavior, the
impact in delay of the onset of sexual activity among the youth, the linkage between HIV sero-status
notification and subsequent behavior, links between productive employment and sexual behavior, would be
eligible for financing. The project could also pilot and follow focus groups to assess behavioral changes in
target groups, the sustainability of behavioral changes, and the effectiveness in the use of available
HIV/STI related services. The NAS would be responsible for coordinating such activities. Monitoring and
Evaluation is a key aspect of the HARRP, and in particular with regard to the project's community
- 33 -



activities. HARRP M&E would be coordinated and consolidated by the NAS. However, much of the
information would be collected, and/or generated by line Departments, DACs, NGOs, and other
participating partners, and/or contracted entities. Monitoring of CCSI activities (See Component 4, below)
will be either contracted out on a national basis by the NAS to cover all Divisions and municipalities, or
divided into smaller packages with a defined geographic focus. This aspect of monitoring will concentrate
on assuring that: activities are implemented in accordance with the approved proposals; and that qualitative
stakeholder progress is taken into account through utilization of tools such as the mapping of behaviors
("risk mapping"), in order to track CCSI input and output indicators. A simple reporting format will be
developed for all activities regardless of their size. Similarly, line Departments will report on inputs and
outputs related to their activities. These monitoring efforts will provide the data for the Govemment to
assess progress in meeting "Key Performance Indicators". The monitoring approach will be developed in
light of the UNAIDS National AIDS Programmes "A Guide to Monitoring and Evaluation" (see Annex 11
for additional information).
Project Component 2 - US$2.65 million
Multi-sectoral Responses for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care
2.1. This component will improve the capacity of non-health Government Departments to respond to the
HIV/AIDS epidemic, emphasizing prevention and care. As part of their ongoing Departmental operations,
this will be achieved through a two-pronged approach, namely: (i) the provision to line Department staff of
HIV/AIDS and STI education, training, condoms, and other support, to encourage HIV/AIDS and STI
avoidance behavior; and (ii) the enhancement of the capacity of their staff to provide their partners and
audiences (e.g., parents-teachers associations, farmers associations, village health committees), the means
to provide effective HIV/AIDS prevention and care. Interested line Departments either have or will appoint
r IIV/AIDS focal persons to carry out Departmental action plans for these two purposes, with support from
HARRP in terms of facilities, equipment, and incremental costs.
2.2. Currently the Departments of State for Education, Agriculture, Defense, Interior (Police, Prisons and
Religious Affairs), Youth, and Tourism are working on such action plans and will be HARRP participants.
Other Departments may join after project effectiveness, subject to availability of funds from the
Government, the HARRP, or other donors. The health sector is separately treated under Component 3
"Health Sector Responses to STI/HIV Management".
2.3. Line Departments would have wide discretion in how they seek to achieve the two goals of: i)
Departmental staff HIV/AIDS and STI avoidance behavior, and ii) their staff reaching their constituencies
on HIV/AIDS and STI issues. Eligible line Department activities would depend on the content of interim
Departmental action plans for the first project year, some of which have already been developed. These
plans include appointment of Departmental focal points, provision for training, technical advisory services,
HIV/AIDS and STI IEC materials, VCT and condom distribution, and support for facilities and equipment,
including incremental operating costs to effectively carry out this effort. As mentioned, such plans address
both internal groups (Departmental staff) and their external target groups on a phased basis. Subsequently,
the final National HIV/AIDS Strategy and Action Plan will refine the activities/instruments of
Departmental plans, and provide the basis for longer-term engagement. Departmental action plans for
external target groups, for illustrative purposes, could include approved IEC/behavioral change
communications messaging, actions, and referrals related to medical prevention as well as care.
Project Component 3 - US$ 1.85 million
Health Sector Responses to STI/HIV Management
- 34 -



3.1. The Department of State for Health and Social Welfare (DOSH) and more broadly the health
community, have special responsibilities for STIs and HIV/AIDS prevention and management. This sector
therefore warrants a separate component, making provision for prevention and care from a health sector
perspective, whether public or private. This component provides the resources to the health sector to build
on the framework of the HIV/AIDS and STIs management manuals recently adopted by the DOSH, as well
as other reproductive and communicable disease activities currently performed by the DOSH and its health
sector partners. DOSH can enhance its reproductive health and opportunistic infection efforts with fuinds
provided herein, recognizing it will not be able to undertake all of the health sector specific tasks at once,
nor do it without assistance from other non-public health care providers. It will prioritize which aspects,
where, when and how quickly it can implement and scale up its HIV/AIDS and STIs management services.
'[he procurement of condoms, opportunistic infection drugs, gloves and other medical supplies, testing kits
and limited laboratory equipment is envisioned. Further, based on the model already in place in one health
facility (Brikama), Reproductive Health Clinics will be installed in each Division and Municipality, with
trained staff. A preliminary draft of the DOSH HIV/AIDS and STI Action Plan will be refined. The basic
features which differentiate the health sector from other sectors are those related to its medical functions
such as diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic infections such as STI and TB, care at health posts, health
centers, and hospitals, and laboratory assaying.
3.2. Two other aspects need highlighting with respect to the health sector: First, blood supply is important
and the enhancement of the blood supply system is being partly addressed under the PHPNP. In this regard,
the stated policy goal of The Gambia is that national blood supplies be controlled and assured as safe.
Donor mobilization is being financed under the PHPNP along with a readiness to cover preparation costs of
a plan for a national blood transfusion services, identify the necessary equipment to complement what is
being done under existing AfDB and IDA financing, what would be needed in terms of blood hags and
reagents, and training of laboratory technicians. The objective would be to ensure that blood for transfusion
and blood products do not transmit STI and HIV. Second, there is need for specialized training in
HIV/AIDS and STI hazardous materials handling and provision of medical supplies to health workers so as
to prevent STI and H1V transmission. Health workers represent a particularly vulnerable group because of
their routine contact with hazardous materials, they are on the front line, and need to be confident their
personal safety and well-being are taken into account so that they actively promote testing of patients and
care for PLWHAs. Inclusion of norms and standards for hazardous waste disposal, appropriate to The
Gambia, will be taken into account at all health facilities, along with training of facility personnel in this
regard.
3.3. The Bank has also been working closely with its UNAIDS partners, drug companies, and
developing-country govemments on access to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. As the situation evolves,
Departments of Health may explore ways of introducing ARV therapy. In The Gambia, should the G
ovemment so decide, the HARRP will be able to support the development of guidelines and the
strengthening of health infrastructure to make the use of these drugs safe, effective and sustainable. IDA
will also actively follow up the trend in affordability and efficacy and remain open, on a case-by-case basis,
to supporting ARV drugs and the necessary infrastructure where resources may be required.
Project Component 4 - US$8.20 million
Community and Civil Society Initiatives
4.1. This component will be a financing mechanism to provide grant resources to support initiatives from a
community, civil society, worker association, "establishment or primary unit", or the like. ("establishments
- 35 -



or primary units" would include businesses, military camps, prisons, refugee camps, religious groups, trade
associations,  sports  clubs, etc.).  It will  therefore  support  both  "community-based"  and
"community-involved" activities. A Community and Civil Society Initiatives mechanism will be established
by, and report to, the NAC, through the NAS. A nominal initial allocation will be made to the five
Divisions (and two municipalities) on a population density basis, so that there is proportionate sharing and
an indicative planning amount from which to begin work.
4.2. Eligible Applicants. Applications can be submitted to the DACs directly by the community or
community association, a private entity, or by collaborators (NGOs, consortiums), on their behalf. An
NGO or other organization can consolidate a number of smaller proposals to create a medium sized
proposal, and submit it to the DAC. In addition, a national, multi-Divisional, or divisional conceptlprogram
benefiting communities which are a priori not identifiable, may be approved for funding under this
component, provided the concept/program meets CCSI eligibility criteria. Basically there will be three
types of proposals put forward by eligible applicants for approval: (i) large scale "Category A" activities
with National, multi-Division or Division coverage and which will require substantial experience, and
institutional capacity, and for which entities will be pre-qualified; (ii) medium-small scale "Category B"
activities which will require considerably lesser standards of capacity, with such organizations ranging
from NGOs, CBOs, PLWHAs, associations, other groups and establishments; and (iii) "Category C"
activities proposed by communities on their own behalf. Category B entities and communities will be able
to obtain modest grant assistance from the HARRP for local consultant support to help in mobilizing
communities to proposals and organizational training, if need be.
4.3. Activities Eligible for Funding. Project proposals will be considered based on an HIV/AIDS Activity
Positive List which will be further defined in an IDA approved, Community and Civil Society Initiatives
Operations Manual. Category B and C activities would usually require approximately a 10% contribution,
in cash or in kind. Category A activities will generally be require approximately a 20 percent contribution,
of which a significant portion is in cash. Assuming a qualified applicant puts forward a proposal consistent
with the menu/positive list, it would be presumed to be eligible for financing. As an "illustrative" list,
Community and Civil Society Initiatives activities would be directed at the following broad areas: (i)
information education and communication/behavioral change communications (IEC/BCC) campaigns; (ii)
support to high-risk groups; (iii) youth-related activities; (iv) condom supply and dissemination, each of
which are further described below. (These descriptions should not limit what may be finally included under
these activities):
(a)   IEC/BCC campaigns. Activities would be geared at the general community and/or small groups,
and encompass public awareness and information campaign/programs. This would include TV and radio,
videos and cassettes to reach villagers, songs, plays, road signs, tee-shirts to convey simple messages, and
indigenous channels for message delivery. The draft 1999 IEC Communications Strategy prepared by the
Department of State for Health can provide a basis for the IEC/BCC menu until a separate HARRP menu
is finalized.
(b)    Support to high-risk groups (and priority target groups). Possible Community and Civil Society
Initiatives activities for high risk groups would include IEC/BCC, promotion of condom use and condom
availability, provision for STI diagnosis, STI and TB treatment and care. High risk groups include
commercial sex workers and their clients, long distance transport workers, migrant workers, hustlers in
tourist areas known as "bumsters", refugees and displaced people, prisoners and those already infected. For
a particular subset of this group, namely PLWHAs, sub-activities could include financing support groups,
NGOs and community organizations to reach families and individuals with coping mechanisms that provide
a package of home-based care supplies (for example, gloves, plastic sheets, etc.) and essential drugs (ex.
- 36 -



aspirin, calamine lotion) for symptomatic and terminally ill patients and their dependents, as well as
medical support, shelter, food supplementation, and care to HIV/AIDS parents, students, and orphans, and
income generating activities for PLWHAs.
(c)    Youth-related activities. Activities would target the youth, defined as aged 15-24, and empower
them to better tackle the threat of HIV/AIDS and STI. Activities would focus on: (i) youth-specific
information, education and communication as well as behavioral change communication (IEC/BCC)
programs; (ii) Family Life Education (FLE) programs for in-school and out-of-school adolescents.
Community and Civil Society Initiatives financing would cover innovative approaches such as
peer-education programs, youth clubs, youth-specific meeting places, and other means. FLE programs in
schools would encourage referral of adolescents to services supported by the Community and Civil Society
Initiatives in the areas of voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), STI treatment, and condom access.
Parent and teacher associations could be financed to play active roles in fostering a "culture of care" in.
schools and the school as one of the main community based organizations countering HV/AIDS; and (iii)
financing of "youth friendly" reproductive health services.
(d)    Condom distribution. IEC/BCC messages without means to carry out actions would not produce
the desired results. Therefore availability, accessibility, and a steady supply of low-cost, or even cost-free
condoms would be essential, and facilitated under Community and Civil Society Initiatives, in conjunction
with, or separate from, other activities supported by the Community and Civil Society Initiatives and the
public health sector.
4.4. Institutional Arrangements. Various institutional options were considered, including contracting the
Gambia Social Development Fund financed by the African Development Bank, channeling all resources to
the decentralized rural development structures supported by the European Development Fund (Support to
Decentralized Rural Development) and which use multi-disciplinary facilitation teams, or utilizing the
Local Initiative Fund (LIF) approved in 1998 under the PHPNP. After due consideration the Gambian
Government determined its preference would be to use multiple channels for developing and presenting
proposals, and rely on Divisional/municipal AIDS Committees and the NAS to process applications for
approval and monitoring activities. The existing mechanisms were found not to be the "right fit", either
because they were principally financing micro-credit operations, in an early testing mode, had limited
geographic coverage, were more infrastructure-oriented, had other priorities, had long appraisal or
developmental timelines, or already had much to do with their current plans and programs. The Community
and Civil Society Initiatives system will be demand driven, will complement existing mechanisms in many
cases, and allow for the full gamut of potential users to access resources. It is also expected that regular
working meetings be held with the different funding entities such as the Social Development Fund, SDRD
and LIF, to share experience, work to complement each other rather than compete for clients, and consider
how these entities might serve as delegated CCSI agents to expand HARRP outreach.
4.5. The selected approach will require supplemental staff for the NAS and DACs as described in
Component 1 sub-component (ii) "HARRP Program Coordination and Administration". With the further
clarification of the Community and Civil Society Operations Manual before operations begin, the full
extent of supplemental staff needs will be known (at this juncture only a HARRP Facilitatoris
contemplated). A CCSI coordinator will be located at NAS, and, for each DAC (or Municipality
equivalent) a HARRP facilitator will be assigned.
4.6. Divisional AIDS Committees (DACs) will be constituted by the existing Division Coordination
Committees (DCCs or Municipality equivalent) which were formed as part of the Government's
decentralization process. The DACs will have roughly equal membership from a) Government (the line
- 37 -



Departments and local governments), and b) NGOs, women, the private sector and PLWHAs (PLWHAs
must be represented). DACs will convene monthly to focus on the proposals submitted under the
Comnmunitv and Civil Society Initiatives as well as discuss the status of HIV/AIDS prevention, and care in
the area. They will also be expected to visit Community and Civil Society Initiative sites from time to time.
4.7. At the national level, the NAS (Secretariat) will report directly to the NAC (Council) on national
proposals or those proposals that exceed threshold amounts and require higher authorization. For finance
management arrangements, see Annex 6.

Annex 4
THE GAMBIA: HIV/AIDS Rapid Response Project
BACKGROUND
1. The "Economic Analysis of HIV/AIDS" of the Project Appraisal Document for the Multi-Country
HIV/AIDS Program (MAP) for the Africa Region (Report No. 20727 AFR, Annex 5), provides the overall
economic justification for the HARRP project. Furthermore, a preliminary analysis of the anticipated
impact of inaction in stemming the course of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in The Gambia has been prepared by
Dr. Warren Stevens, Health Economist, MRC Laboratories in Fajara and Mr. Pa Lamin Beyai, Health
Economist, WHO Gambia. It is the intention of the HIV/AIDS team at MRC in conjunction with the
Health Economist at WHO Gambia, working with the Government of The Gambia, to look in more detail
at these issues during the implementation of the HARRP, therefore reflecting Gambian-specific needs and
approaches. The assumptions and methodology for the preliminary analytical work are set forth in this
Annex.
MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS OF THE ANALYSIS
2. Three major assumptions have been made for the preliminary analysis. First, it has been assumed that
"herd immunity" effects and falling marginal costs on increased cost-effectiveness (CE) will apply to the
spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In other words, there is a multiplier effect from the interventions.
"Herd immunity" effects have been observed with vaccines programs: it is the point at which the force of
infection falls below one and incidence starts to drop, despite a proportion of the population remaining
un-immunised. This is due to the fact that the rate of infection is a function of the proportion of people in
the population who are infected. As this proportion gets smaller, it becomes ever less likely for the
non-immunised will become infected. With respect to HIV/AIDS, it is thought that if a high enough
proportion of the sexually active population changes its sexual behavior and/or starts wearing condoms
during casual sex (because of intervention programs), this could benefically effect the infection rate of
those who have not been involved with the interventions, and/or have not changed their sexual behavior.
The result is that as one more unit of intervention is undertaken, slightly more than the equivalent numbers
of cases of infection are averted as coverage of the intervention increases (see Figure 1 below for
divergence from the linear of cases averted as coverage increases).

Coverage/t
3. The second assumption is that the costs of interventions will fall over time (t). Many of the interventions
included in the HAARP are unlikely to cost the same every year, after the program reaches full coverage
(in this analysis, in Year 4). The costing model for the Stepping Stones project shows that incremental
costs fall over time once training activities have been introduced and established within communities.
Other examples are youth education programs for all enrollees, workplace and commercial sex worker
interventions, where significant institutional turnover is likely to be low and where repeat interventions may
not be required. Nevertheless falling costs over time have not been assumed in the model. This would yield
a cost curve closer to that shown in Figure 1.
4. The third assumption is with regard to the trends used for predicting the future incidence of HIV in The
Gambia. Two scenarios of HIV prevalence have been chosen after discussions with HIV/AIDS experts
from MRC, WHO, and the Government of The Gambia. The first is an exponential growth with the rate of
incidence doubling every five years. and the second takes the same growth rate but flattens out at 7%. The
latter has been more closely associated with the spread of the disease in West Africa. The expected effect
from the introduction of an intensive prevention program has been assumed as the flattening out of
incidence by the time coverage reaches 100% after four years, at around 2.5%. Only HIV-1 has been
included in the model. The time from HIV-1 infection to AIDS is estimated at 8 years, and the life
expectancy from this point is estimated at 2 years. The three trends shown in Figure 2 below are a
worst-case scenario from Eastern and Southern Africa where an exponential growth has been seen (heavily
broken line), a West African example based on data from Cameroon (intermittent broken line) and the
anticipated effect of the prevention program that holds prevalence constant after reaching 100% coverage
after 4 years (straight line).

CALCULATIONS USED IN THE ANALYSIS
5. The cost of HIV/AIDS prevention activities. This is simply the PTG (population target group) x
unit cost x coverage rate for each year. Where there is no better local data, the unit costs from the
World Bank HIV scaling up document are used. No attempt has been made to estimate a falling
MC/AC (Marginal Cost/Average Cost) curve and so scaling up is done with a flat AC (Average Cost)
curve.
6. The cost of continued increase in new infections (health care costs).  As with above, where
possible local data has been used, whereas where that is not possible the costs from the scaling up
paper has been used. Once again a flat cost curve and the formula is simply (prevalence HIV x unit
cost) + (prevalence AIDS x unit cost). Costs of treatment are based on only 10% of HIV + being
aware of their status and hence receiving the PLHA care package.
7. Expected effect on GNP growth. This is split into three sections: human capital, social capital, and
household consumption function (affects on savings). The human capital element has been completed,
and social capital and savings have been bundled although the data for this is slim. The human capital
is just lost earnings. Here the formula used is "Incidence of AIDS x GNP per capita x % economically
active x output elasticity of labor". This will be calculated for four groups: male urban, female urban,
male rural, female rural, by year.
8. The social capital sheets will attempt to estimate the effect on increased expenditure on health care
(for those members of families with HIV/AIDS) on savings. In addition there will be an effort to
calculate the effect on reduced savings on expenditure on education. Data is also lacking on the cost of
care falling on a household and the average household expenditure on education in primary and
secondary school, and some data on the relative GNP per capita rates from different levels of education
received for male/female/urban/rural is also lacking.
9. Net economic benefit. This will be calculated as:

treatment); and
*     No attempt will be made to estimate the impact of changes in savings on school enrollment;
nevertheless this is likely to be a sizable element of the likely long-term economic impact of HIV in The
Gambia.
10. Assumptions for variables. Due to the lack of data available and the time constraints the following
assumptions will be made (population group data based on 1993 census (updated by total growth figures
for recent years):
o     Urban commercial sex workers estimated at 1,280;
o     Formal employment estimated to cover 23,672 (1.8%);
o      Cost of media campaign estimated at US$0.25 per head;
o     Unit costs of prevention from all other programs are estimated as in the World Bank MAP reports
for poor countries;
o     Exchange rate of US$1 = 13 Dalasis;
o     Estimation of incidence from model #2 comes from growth of HIV seen in Uganda;
o     Estimation of incidence from model #3 comes from growth of HIV seen in Cameroon;
o     Estimation of impact of prevention program comes from Senegal;
o      The period of time from infection with HIV to the onset of AIDS is estimated as a mean of 8 years;
o      The period of time from the onset of AIDS to death is estimated as a mean of 2 years;
o      The costs of treatment of HIV/AIDS are taken from the World Bank MAP document;
o     The cost of treatment for people which HIV is limited to 10% of the HIV population as this is the
anticipated proportion of the population who are likely to be aware of their status;
o      GNP per capita is estimated as total GNP divided by the adult working population (15-49);
o      The differences between the GNP per capita for urban and rural were taken from Treasury figures
showing GNP from industry and services separately from GNP from agriculture and census data showing
the relative size of the population in the rural and urban areas. From this data it was estimated that GNP
per capita in urban areas (industry, services) was 2.64 times greater than the average whereas in rural areas
(agriculture) it was 0.3 times the average;
o      Output elasticity of supply was taken from studies done by the World Bank on agriculture in
Africa; and
o      Employment status was taken for the 1998 Gambia Poverty Survey.
RESULTS
11. The results of the preliminary analysis are presented in Table 1 below, in Dalasi (constant 2000 prices).
Model # 2 refers to the Eastern and Southern Africa scenario and Model # 3 refers to the Cameroon
scenario (Model # I is what we expect to happen in The Gambia should prevention strategies be
successful). The negative values of the column "Net cost of prevention program" are savings.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
THE GAMBIA: HIVIAIDS Rapid Response Project
Procurement
General.
1.1. A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) for the Gambia was carried out in 1998.
National procedures for procurement of works, goods, and services were found to be wanting in several
areas.. The Government has responded recently by making some changes in its Financial Instructions but
further revisions are needed to make the procedures more satisfactory. Follow-up Bank assistance is being
considered to help in the preparation of a procurement code. So far, findings of the CPAR remain valid. In
general, Gambian's procurement laws and regulations do not conflict with IDA Guidelines. No special
exceptions, permits, or licenses need to be specified in the Credit since the Gambia's procurement practices
allow IDA procedures to take precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations.
1.2. Civil Works and Goods financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with Bank's Guidelines under
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995 revised in January and August 1996, September 1997, and
January 1999), and Bank Standard Bidding Documents, and Standard Evaluation Report will be used for
ICB. National Competitive Bidding (NCB) advertised locally will be carried out in accordance with the
Gambia's procurement laws and regulations, acceptable to IDA, provided that they assure economy,
efficiency, transparency, and broad consistency with key objectives of the Bank Guidelines. For NCB
procedures, the Government gave assurances during negotiations that: (i) methods used in the evaluation of
bids and the award of contracts are made known to all bidders and not be applied arbitrarily; (ii) any bidder
is given adequate response time (four weeks) for preparation and submission of bids; (iii) bid evaluation
and bidder qualification are clearly specified in bidding documents; (iv) no preference margin is granted to
domestic manufacturers; (v) eligible firms are not precluded from participation; (vi) award will be made to
the lowest evaluated bidder in accordance with pre-determnined and transparent methods; (vii) bid
evaluation reports will clearly state the reasons to reject any non-responsive bid.
1.3. Consultant Services contracts financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for the Selection of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997 revised in September
1997, and January 1999). The standard Request for Proposal, as developed by the Bank, will be used for
appointment of consulting firms. Simplified contracts will be used for short-term assignments, i.e. those not
exceeding six months, carried out by firms or individual consultants. The Government was briefed during
the appraisal mission about the features of the new Consultants Guidelines, in particular with regards to
advertisement, bid opening and various steps of IDA reviews.
1.4. Community Participation in procurement will be based on the Bank's Simplified Procurement and
Disbursement Procedures for Community-Based Investments.
1.5. Given the urgency of the project, a General Procurement Notice (GPN) for the first year of operations
will be prepared and issued in the United Nations Development Business (UNDB) website without the need
for hard-copy publication, as well as in the local newspapers to advertise for any ICB for works and goods,
and for major consulting assignments, to obtain expressions of interest. The requirement for printed
publication of GPN has been waived by the RPA office. The detailed GPN for the subsequent years will be
prepared for the project and published in the UNDB. It will be updated annually for all outstanding
procurement. Specific Procurement Notices (SPN) and Expressions of Interest (EOI) will be prepared for

4. Miscellaneous _II
Total value of contracts subject to prior review: US$1.50
2.1. Civil works. No large civil works are scheduled for the project. Civil works contracts include the
construction of 5 Reproductive Health Clinics scattered throughout the country and are unlikely to attract
foreign contractors. Costing less than US$100,000 per contract, up to aggregate of US$0.35 million, they
would be procured through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures in accordance with
procedures described in the Project Operations Manual (POM) and acceptable to IDA. Contracts for small
works under Component- 4 will mostly be works relating to small community structures such as PLWHA
care centers, youth facilities, community meeting facilities etc. These small works are estimated to cost less
than US$20,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$2.0 million. They would be procured
under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified
domestic contractors invited to bid. The invitation will include a detailed description of the works, including
basic specifications, the required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to IDA, and
relevant drawings where applicable. The award would be made to the contractor who offers the lowest
price quotation for the required work, provided he demonstrates he has the experience and resources to
complete the contract successfully.
2.2. Goods. The total cost of goods is estimated at US$4.07 million for the project. Procurement of goods
will be bulked where feasible into packages valued at US$ 100,000 equivalent or more per package and
will be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Preference for domestically
manufactured goods will apply in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines. Contracts for office
furniture and equipment, vehicles and materials locally available which cost more than US$20,000 but less
than US$100,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million would be procured through National
Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to IDA. Procurement of laboratory equipment,
furniture for NAS, DACs and line Departments, printed materials for IEC, and other instructional
materials costing less than US$ 20,000 up to an aggregate amount of US$0.35 million equivalent will be
-49 -



procured through prudent International Shopping and National Shopping in accordance with provisions of
paragraph 3.5 and 3.6 of the Guidelines. These aggregate limits do not include contracts under
Component-4.
2.3. The procedures followed, and total aggregate amount for all shopping methods under the project, will
be reviewed after six months of project operations. Depending on performance and the results of the
review, the total aggregate amount may be adjusted where necessary. Standard request forms and
establishment of guidelines for conducting the shopping methods (as per the June 9, 2000 Memorandum
"Guidance on Shopping") should be prepared and included in the POM.
2.4. Procurement of spare parts, operating expenditures, minor off-the-shelf items, generic pharmaceuticals
and other specialist equipment and proprietary items costing less than US$5,000 equivalent per contract up
to an aggregate of US$0.50 million equivalent, may be procured directly from manufacturers and
authorized local distributors.
2.5. Given the urgency of the project, and to facilitate speedy procurement of items required urgently for
institutional strengthening, specific contracts for Component I related to drugs, medical supplies, kits, and
condoms; computers and accessories, office equipment may be procured from the (c) United Nations
Agencies (i.e., UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO, WFP, IAPSO) in accordance with para. 3.9 of the Procurement
Guidelines. All contracts under the above-stated "Emergency Requirements" must be concluded within 12
months of the Credit Effectiveness date. The list of these items and their estimated value should be agreed
upon with IDA as per the approved Procurement Plan. The procurement and timely distribution of the
goods will be the responsibility of NAS.
2.6 Grants to community-based sub-projects. The CCSI will finance community and civil society
HIV/AIDS-related activities, such as IEC, minor repairs or works, purchase of generic drugs, Family Life
Education (FLE) books, food rations and medical supplies (e.g. gloves, plastic sheets), care and support for
PLWHAs their dependents and orphans, HlV/AIDS-prevention promotion, youth activities, income
generating activities for PLWHAs and their dependents. Funding for these activities will be in the formn of
grants.
2.7. Work programs under Component 4 will depend on applications received from communities, NGOs,
line Departments and private organizations against a positive list of activities. It is not possible to
deternine the exact mix of goods, small works, and services to be procured under these activities due to
their demand-driven nature. Therefore, the types of activities to be financed under these activities and their
procurement details will depend on the needs identified by communities.
2.8. The Bank Guidelines for Simplified Procurement and Disbursement for Community-Based Investments
will be used in the design of procurement under this aspect of the project. The NAC through NAS will be
responsible for ensuring compliance with these guidelines, and ex-post reviews of random sub-projects will
be conducted periodically by the Bank and independent consultants appointed by the NAS. Simplified
procurement and disbursement procedures for community-based programs, including the positive list of
items qualifying under this component, will be developed and included in the Project Operation Manual
(POM) and CCSI Operations Manual, for approval by IDA. The CCSI Operations Manual will include
procedures for IDA prior review thresholds for NGOs, private sector, and other community initiatives.

Consultants services
3.1. Consultant Services. The consulting services required will be mostly in the areas of H1V/AIDS
education, IEC/BCC, applied research, training, community development, financial management,
monitoring and evaluation, information dissemination, auditing, and accounting. It will also include the
selection of the Agency responsible for designing and implementing an integrated community awareness
and action approach like "Stepping Stones". The exact mix (types of consultancy, budgets, procurement
methods) will be discussed and agreed annually during joint reviews. Consultants will be hired through
competition based on (i) Quality-and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) among qualified short-listed firms, by
evaluating the quality of the proposals before combining quality and cost evaluation, by weighting and
adding the quality and cost scores. (ii) Least Cost Selection (LCS) in accordance with para. 3.1 and 3.6 of
the Consultant Guidelines, will be used for audit contracts costing less than US$ 100,000; the firm with the
lowest price will be selected, provided its technical proposal received the minimum mark. Selection based
on consultant's qualifications may be used for the selection of research institutes, training institutions, and
for assignments that meet criteria set out in para 3.7 of the guidelines. (iii) Consulting services meeting the
requirements of Section V of the Consultant Guidelines will be selected under the provisions for the
Selection of Individual Consultants (IC) which is basically through comparison of the CVs of at least 3
qualified individuals; and (iv) Single Source Selection (SSS) will be used for (a) the hiring of the local
Contract management agency (GAMWORKS) in charge of the construction of the 5 reproductive health
clinics (b) for specific tasks that meet criteria set out in para 3.8 to 3.11 of the guidelines, and (c) for
consulting assignments costing less than $5,000 up to an aggregate of US$0.50 million. The NAS would
ensure that procurement notices are widely publicized to get candidacies from consultants (firms and
individuals). Based on agreed upon criteria, the NAS will maintain and update a list of consultants which
will be used to establish short-lists.
3.2. To ensure that priority is given to the identification of suitable and qualified national consultants,
short-lists for contracts estimated under US$100,000 or equivalent may be comprised entirely of national
consultants (in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines), provided
that a sufficient number of qualified firms (at least three) are available at competitive costs. However, if
foreign firms have expressed interest, they will not be excluded from consideration. The Standard Request
for Proposal (RFP) as developed by the Bank will be used for requesting proposals, and for selection and
appointment of consulting firms. Simplified contracts will be used for short-term assignments-simple
missions of a standard nature (i.e., those not exceeding six months) carried out by individual consultants or
firms. The Govermment was briefed during appraisal and negotiations about the special features of the new
guidelines and the RFP, in particular with regard to advertisement, public bid opening, and evaluation
criteria.
3.3. Training, workshops, and study tours. The total cost of these activities is estimated at US$1.60
million for the project. Training, workshops, conference attendance and study tours will be carried out on
the basis of approved annual programs that will identify the general framework of training or similar
activities for the year, including the nature of training/study tours/workshops, the number of participants,
and cost estimates. All out of country long-term training which is over 3-months will be subject to IDA
approval. Post-reviews of in-country training will be conducted from time to time to review the selection of
institutions/course contents/trainees and justifications thereof, and costs incurred.
IDA Reviews
4. 1. IDA-financed contracts for goods and works above the threshold value of US$ 100,000 equivalent will
-51 -



be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. Draft standard bidding document formats for NCB will be
reviewed and agreed upon with IDA. Prior IDA review will not apply to contracts for the recruitment of
consulting firms and individuals estimated to cost less than US$100,000 and US$50,000 equivalent,
respectively. However, the exception to prior review will not apply to the Terms of Reference of such
contracts, regardless of value, to single-source hiring, to assignments of a critical nature (such as audits) as
determnined by IDA, or to amendments of contracts rising the contract value above the prior review
threshold. For consultants contracts estimated to cost less than US$100,000, but more than US$50,000,
opening the financial envelopes will not take place prior to receiving the Bank's no-objection to the
technical evaluation.
4.2. Documents related to procurement below the prior review thresholds will be maintained by the
Government for ex-post review by auditors and IDA supervision missions. The first three NCB contracts
and first five contracts with Communities financed under Component 4 will be subject to prior review
during the first year of the Project. Emergency procurement for goods will require prior review by IDA.
4.3. All thresholds stated in this section will be reviewed by the Borrower and IDA on an annual basis.
Modifications may be agreed upon, based on performance and actual values of procurement implemented.
Amendments to the Development Credit Agreement may be proposed, as necessary.
Procurement implementation arrangements
5.1. The overall coordination of project implementation will be done by the NAS, with each line
Department and NGO/CBO responsible for implementation of their relevant work programs. Major
procurement such as vehicles, office and medical equipment will be handled by NAS. Procurement of items
related to IEC/BCC materials, workshops, training, and operations will be handled by the line Departments
and DACs using the specified procurement methods identified for the project. Ownership of the signed
contracts and contract management will be with respective line Departments and DACs. An assessment of
procurement capacity of NAS, DAC and line Departments was done (see assessment report below). An
action plan was agreed upon to be completed before Credit effectiveness.
5.2. Fifty percent of the project funds are allocated to Component-4. The procurement plan for the first
year was prepared during appraisal and will be finalized before Effectiveness. It is based on the initial
needs of the NAS, DACs and line Departments. Costs beyond Project Year 1 for the subsequent years are
only indicative. The exact mix of procurement will be determined on an annual basis during the annual joint
reviews between NAC/NAS, IDA, and other partners, where a draft procurement plan for the following
financial year will be presented and agreed upon. During 2001 the detailed procurement plans for
subsequent years will be developed and submitted to IDA for review and approval. The plan will include
relevant information on goods, works, and consulting services under the project as well as the timing of
each milestone in the procurement process. The procurement schedule will be updated semi-annually for the
first eighteen months, and quarterly thereafter for PMR based disbursements. These plans will be reviewed
by IDA supervision missions.
Project Operations Manuals: Procurement
6.1. The Project Operations Manual prepared by the Borrower will include a specific section on
Procurement detailing: (i) procedures for planning, calling for bids, selecting contractors, consultants, and
vendors, and awarding contracts; (ii) internal organization for supervision and control of works; (iii)
procedures for handing over completed works.
- 52 -



6.2. The Government has submitted to IDA a draft Procurement Plan for the first year. The Government
gave assurances that it will (a) use the Bank's standard bidding documents, (b) apply the agreed
procurement procedures and arrangements, and (c) annually review the procurement plan with IDA.
Procurement Capacity Assessment.
Overall Procurement Risk Assessment:
High             7X

Frequency of procurement supervision missions proposed: Once every 6 month(s) (includes special
procurement supervision for post-review/audits). Post Reviews will apply to one (1) contract out of four (4)
not subject to prior review. Also, the first three NCB contracts and first five grant contracts financed
under Component 4 will be subject to prior review.

Signature:
Date:   November 23, 2900
Comments:
Based on the capacity assessment carried out during the appraisal mission in November 2000, it can be concluded that
Line Departments and Divisional/municipalities level require improvement in areas of bidding document preparation, bid
evaluation, and procurement filing. In general, line Departments with prior Bank experience (Health; Agriculture;
Education) have better understanding of Bank procurement requirements, compared to other line Departments or divisional
comrimittees and municipalities. An action plan was agreed to address areas where the existing structures still need to be
strengthened to meet performance criteria for PMR-based disbursement. The action plan includes (i) Hiring of a
procurement specialist under NAS who will play the lead role in the handling of major procurement, including planning
and implementation, quality control, and assistance to the procurement units of other participating agencies; (ii)
Development of a Project Operations Manual (POM) to ensure adequate coverage of procurement, including a
computerized procurement and contract management system integrated into the financial management system; (iii)
Organization of a filing system to ensure availability of, and easy access to procurement records, and (iv) training of staff
on Bank procurement procedures and the use of Bank standard bidding documents.
Also, as part of the TORs of the Financial Management Agent (FMA) to be recruited by the NAS, simplified
procedures and standardized documentation for Community and Civil Society Initiatives will be designed and the
necessary training provided to the signatories of the communities, so that they can canry out the procurement function in a
manner acceptable to the Govermment and the Association. In addition, the Credit will finance capacity building for
specific training and strengthening needs of the CBOs/NGOs. Staffing gaps will be addressed through the hiring of
Contract Management Agency to handle civil works procurement; and the use of UN agencies for the
procurement of most goods (condoms) and equipment (such as vehicles) for the initial needs of the project.
Given the complexity of the organizational set up and the diversity of implementing agencies, project
implementation will require extensive supervision. Therefore, it has been agreed that one in four contracts not
subject to IDA prior review would be subject to post-review by the Bank . Also, a procurement audit is
envisaged every two years.

Disbursement
Allocation of credit proceeds (Table C)
Disbursementprocedures
Specific disbursement procedures will be developed for the HARRP to address the need for rapid response.
The key considerations defined for the Multi-country HIV/AIDS Program will apply to the HARRP. These
considerations are: a) a link between physical progress and project expenditure, b) the need for a sufficient
balance in the Special Account to cover decentralized and emergency activities, and c) an efficient and
effective flow of funds to meet the needs of the project during a relatively short implementation period.
Funds will be disbursed from IDA into a single Special Account administered at central level, on behalf of
the NAS by the Financial Management Agent(FMA). The initial deposit into the Special Account will
cover IDA financing for the first six months of project implementation. There will be no advance account
for the line Departments. The expenses of the latter, related to the activities of the Project, will be paid
directly by NAS/FMA from the Special Account based on payment requests sent by the line Departments
to NAS.
Disbursement of funds to the Divisional/municipal accounts and to individual community and NGO
accounts will follow the guidelines for simplified procurement and disbursement for community-based
investments issued by the World Bank. Funds will be transferred from the central Special Account to the
Divisional/municipal bank accounts based on the sub-projects approved and the annual work programs.
Disbursement of funds to the individual communities will be done from the Divisional/municipal accounts
following the approval of the sub-projects. For larger sub-projects, disbursement can be done directly from
the Special Account to the beneficiaries account given the large amounts involved. The replenishment of
funds into the Special Account and divisional/municipal accounts will be administered on behalf of the
NAS by the FMA.
Use of PMR-based disbursement method
The overall project financial management system will include Project Management Reporting capability
from the beginning of project implementation. However, it is difficult to make accurate cash forecasts,
particularly for the first year, given the nature of the project. Therefore, it is unlikely that the project will be
able to use the Project Management Report (PMR) based disbursement method from the beginning of the
project. Nevertheless, quarterly PMR reports, including financial, procurement and physical progresss, will
be prepared as soon as the project starts. During an interim period of 18 months the PMR will be reviewed
and improved and the financial management capacity at all levels will be strengthened. The project is
expected to operate under PMR-based disbursement at the end of the 18-months interim period. In the
meantime, the project will follow traditional disbursement methods.
Allocation of credit proceeds (Table C)
The project is expected to be completed over a five-year period according to the categories shown in Table
C, and the Credit closing date would be six months after the fifth year to allow payment of last invoices for
contracts completed before the completion time. Government counterpart funds needed for each fiscal year
to cover the share of investments and recurrent costs not financed by IDA will be deposited by the
Government in a Project Account (PA) managed by the NAS, on a quarterly basis.

Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
Disbursement of the IDA Credit for contracts valued at less than US$100,000 equivalent for civil works
and goods, and less than US$] 00,000 for consulting firms (US$50,000 for individual consultant contracts),
all incremental operating costs and training, and all CCSI grants under US$100,000 would be made against
Statements of Expenditures, (SOEs) for which documentation would be made available for examination by
auditors (including technical audits) and by IDA supervision missions.
Special account:
To facilitate disbursement of eligible expenditures for works, goods, services and grants, the Government
will open a Special Account (SA) in the Central Bank of the Gambia to cover IDA's share of eligible
expenditures. Authorized allocation of the special account would be US$ 1,000,000 covering an estimated
6 months of eligible expenditures financed by IDA. All expenditures eligible for IDA financing of less than
US$ 100,000 equivalent would be paid from the SA. Additionally, the borrower would be authorized to
withdraw from the Special Account and deposit into each 90-day Advance account funds to assist
Divisional HIV/AIDS Committees (DACs) or municipal equivalents, to pay for goods and services under
Part D of the project. NAS will be responsible for submitting monthly replenishment applications with
appropriate supporting documentation for expenditures incurred and will retain and make the documents
available for review by IDA supervision missions and project auditors.
The Special Account will be replenished through the submission of Withdrawal Applications on a monthly
basis and will include reconciled bank statements and other documents as my be required, until 18 months
after effectiveness of the Credit, after which further deposits to the Special Account will be on a quarterly
basis as determined through the Project Management Reporting System. All disbursement will be channeled
then through the SA . Under the PMR based disbursement the borrower may choose also to pre-finance
project expenditures and subsequently seek reimbursement from IDA.
Financial management arran2ements
A financial management system, acceptable to IDA, will be established for The Gambia WHV/AIDS Rapid
Response Project (HARRP). It will provide accurate and timely information regarding resources and
expenditures. The financial management system will include accounting, project management reporting
-60 -



(financial, procurement and physical progress) and auditing elements. For this purpose, a financial
management capacity assessment was done as presented below. The findings of the assessment are taken
into consideration to design the proposed financial management system, and an action plan was defined to
strengthen the project capacity at all levels to ensure compliance with World Bank Operational Policies and
Procedures (OP/BP 10.02) and the Financial Management Initiative.
Financial Management Capacity Assessment
Scope of the assessment
By looking at the implementation arrangements of the Project, there will be basically three major circuits
for the flows of funds: one going to the NAS, one to the line Departments through the NAS, and one to the
communities/applicants for the CCSI through the DAC. Project funds and accounts will be managed at
NAS level, within the line Departments, at DAC, and at the community level. Given these settings, the
assessment needs to address the financial management capacity of NAS, line Departments, DAC and the
communities.
The financial management capacity assessment was conducted during project preparation and updated
during project appraisal. Several meetings were held with representatives from the Department of State for
Finance and Economic Affairs, the Office of the Accountant General and accounting units of several line
Departments to discuss possible options for the financial management arrangements and to review the
existing capacity at each level. Field visits to a Municipality and a Division were also organized to assess
the capacity at the decentralized level to ensure the feasibility of the decentralized approach of the Project,
namely for the CCSI mechanism. In addition, a meeting was held with representatives from an international
accounting firm based in Banjul to ensure the existence of adequate capacity in countiy for the outsourcing
of the project's financial management.
Mainfindings of the assessment
NAS: As the administrative, coordinating, and monitoring mechanism for the entire Project, NAS would
have the overall responsibility of the project's financial management. Because NAS is yet to be created, it
does not have any existing capacity. Setting up a proper financial management system for the not yet
established NAS would not fit with the rapid response approach of the project and at the same time address
the accountability and internal control requirements. The final option agreed with the Governmuent of The
Gambia was therefore to outsource the financial management, initially for a two year period, at which time
it would be jointly reviewed by the Government and IDA. This option was discussed with various parties
including a reputable accounting firm, and it was confirmed that it would be feasible with local expertise.
Line Departments: The review of Government's existing disbursement systems led to the conclusion that
these systems do not facilitate timely flow of funds directly to implementing entities. The normal
disbursement procedures going through the Treasury are too long and do not fit the need for rapid response
of the Project. Each line Department has an accounting unit of variable size depending on the size of the
Department. Usually there are a Principal Accountant and Account Clerks appointed by the Accountant
General. Most line Departments use below the line accounts to expedite disbursements. There are basically
two types of below the line accounts: i) normal below the line accounts whereby the line Departments
prepare payment vouchers which are then sent to the Office of the Accountant General to process the
payments; ii) self-accounting below the line accounts whereby funds are transferred to a bank account
directly managed by the line Departnents which process the payments.
Larger line Departments such as Health (DOSH) are also familiar with managing external donors' funds
-61 -



for projects located in these Depailments. The management of these funds is similar to that of the
self-accounting below the line accounts. It is more likely that self-accounting type of below the line
accounts will better fit the needs of the project. It was decided that there will be no advance accounts for
the line Departments under this project. Line Departments expenses related to project activities will be paid
directly by NAS/FMA based on a approved annual budget and payment requests sent to NAS by the line
Departments.
DAC: Each Division or Municipality has an accounting unit. The accounting unit of the Division and the
Municipality visited during project preparation have gained some experience in keeping the accounts of
community-based development projects including managing commercial bank accounts and recording and
reporting on the expenses. HARRP financial management at the decentralized level will build on this
experience.
Communitv level: One of the most important aspects of the project is to channel funds directly to the
communities through the CCSI mechanism. Funds will be managed directly by the communities. This does
not mean that the financial management of the sub-projects should be overlooked. On the contrary, an
appropriate financial management system at the community level will help ensure that funds received are
used for the purpose intended. As a result of the visits to a municipality and a Division, it was noted that
the proposed approach is being implemented in The Gambia. The Local Initiative Fund (LIF) is one
example. However, two major concerns were raised: i) the problem of capacity at the community level,
which must be addressed through training, ii) the need to specify clearly the reporting requirements, which
must be simple to cope with local capacity.
Proposed Financial Management, Reporting, Auditing Arrangements
NAS will be administratively responsible to produce a quarterly project management report. It will also
produce financial reports (as a part of the quarterly report) with the help of the FMA.. Line Departments
will administer the approved annual plans through their focal points. These focal points will be responsible
for overall project implementation of their respective annual work plans and preparation of project progress
reports. NAS will arrange for any technical support needed. DACs will manage matters related to
community projects (either approved at the DAC or at the NAC/NAS levels).
Financial Management
The design of the financial management arrangements will aim at ensuring both timely and reliable flow of
funds to the implementing entities at all levels. For this purpose, the financial management of the project at
the central level will be contracted out to the private sector (Financial Management Agent- FMA). The
FMA will be responsible on carrying out all matters related to the financial management of the project
under the supervision of NAS. The FMA will locate staff in NAS who will facilitate the collation of
financial statements received from various implementing entities. As instructed by NAS, FMA will manage
the principal HARRP accounts, disbursements of funds from them such as advances, replenishments of
advances, payments to NAS goods and service providers. In collaboration with the NAS, FMA will also
assist the accounts units of participating line Departments and the DACs (or municipality equivalent) in
properly maintaining the Project accounts.
The financial management arrangements for this project will build on existing accounting units within line
Departments, Municipal Councils and the geographic Divisions, under the responsibility of NAS, assisted
by the FMA. Terns of reference (TORs) for the selection of the FMA were drafted. They were reviewed by
IDA during appraisal and found to be satisfactory. They specify that the selected firm will set up the
project's financial management system (including development of the Project Operations Manual and the
installation of financial management software) and provide technical support including training and post an
- 62 -



adequate number and mix of FMA staff at NAS on a permanent basis. It should be noted that with respect
to the Community and Civil Society Initiatives, the approval of proposals will be the responsibility of the
NAS and DACs (or municipality equivalent), while disbursement will be separate and overseen by the
relevant accounting units and the FMA.
National HIV/AIDS Secretariat (NAS): Expenses for activities carried out by the NAS will be financed
directly from the Special Account administered by the Financial Management Agent. A representative of
the FMA and the Director of the NAS, would be signatories for the Special Account (two must sign). In the
absence of, or as designated by the NAS Director, the NAS Deputy Director would be able to sign along
with the representative of the FMA.
Line Departments: For each of the participating line Departments, an accountant from the accounting unit
will be specifically designated (based on his/her qualifications), to be responsible for HARRP operations
bookkeeping. Financial management, reporting and intemal control procedures applicable within the line
Departments will be developed in the Project Operations Manual, which will be prepared by the FMA.
Payments will be processed through the Special Account based on requests sent by the line Departments.
Payments will be done only after satisfactory controls on the supporting documents are perforned by
NAS/FMA. The Project Operations Manual will contain financial management and intemal control
procedures applicable to the line Departments.
To address the issue of financial management capacity within the line Departments, training will be
provided to accountants involved in the financial management of the project. Costs for this training will be
financed under the project, under Component I, sub-component b) "Coordination and Administration". In
addition, funds will be disbursed to line Department bank on the basis of payment requests reflecting an
approved annual budget; and replenishments to line Departments will be approved after adequate
docwnentation of the funds provided, and after the FMA Agent performs appropriate controls.
Community and Civil Society Initiatives Financial Management: Arrangements for fnancial management
of the Community and Civil Society Initiatives will be partly based on experience with the Local Initiatives
Fund (LIF), which is being tested under the on-going PHPNP project, as well as other similar efforts.
Under the LIF, a bank account is opened at the Divisional/municipal level in a commercial bank and
managed by the Divisional/municipal LIF agent (who is the Community Development Officer).
Disbursement from the Divisional/municipal bank account to the communities for approved sub-projects is
done by check. Books of accounts are maintained at the Divisional/municipal level with the support from
the Division or Municipal Council's accounting unit. At the community level, a minimum level of
accounting is maintained with the assistance of extension workers to prepare and submit to the Divisional
LIF agent, monthly expenditure reports. The LIF Agent at Divisional/municipal level maintains a
Cashbook, Monthly Expenditure Report, and Project Ledger in addition to a Bank Reconciliation Statement
and Payment Voucher.
Mechanisms similar to those described above for the LIF will be implemented for Community and Civil
Society Initiatives. A bank account will be opened in a commercial bank for each Division/Municipal
Council. A designated qualified accountant from the Divisional/municipal accounting unit will manage it.
The signatories for these bank accounts will be the head of the Divisional or municipal HIV/AIDS
Committee (DAC) and the designated accountant (two must sign). In the absence of the head of the DAC,
the Commissioner/Chairman of the Municipal Council will sign with the accountant. Quarterly budget
allocations based on the divisions/municipalities funds allocation and annual work plans will be transferred
to the Divisional/municipal bank accounts from the Special Account. Funds will be disbursed from the
Divisional/municipal bank accounts to the communities or other approved applicants NGOs, unions,
establishments, by check. Communities or other approved applicants will be encouraged to deposit funds
received into a bank account (depending on proximity of bank branches), or use a safe to secure the funds.

They will maintain simple book of accounts and report monthly on their expenditures to the
division/municipality. There will be publicity regarding the grants made to enhance transparency and
accountability.
The design of the financial management system at the Divisional/municipal and community levels as well
as the accounting procedures and coordination and reporting mechanisms between all levels will be further
detailed in the Project Operations Manual. To improve financial management capacity at the
Divisional/municipal and community/approved applicant levels, accountants from the Divisional and
Municipal Accounting Units and community members as well as other approved applicants will be trained
in financial management. Training provided under other projects, particularly at the community level, will
be taken into account in the design of the training activities to avoid duplication, ensure better use of
resources, and harmonize procedures with other capacity building initiatives.
Reporting
Each of the line Departments, DAC secretariats and the NAS will prepare Annual Work Programs (AWP),
including disbursement forecasts. All Annual Work Programs will be consolidated by the NAS into the
Project's overall Annual Work Program, to be submitted to the Bank. Based on AWPs, each line
Department and DAC Secretariat will prepare quarterly financial and progress reports. The Financia!
Management Agent will prepare the NAS's financial report and consolidate all individual financial reports
into the Project's overall quarterly report. DAC financial reports will include transactions in conjunction
with other activities financed under the Community and Civil Society Initiatives based on monthly
expenditure reports prepared and sent by the communities/approved applicants to the DAC. The Project
Operations Manual will further elaborate on reporting requirements.
Audit requirements
The main characteristic of this project is the relatively large number of bank accounts and the
decentralization of the financial management, both of which are aimed at addressing the need for rapid
response, given the goals of the project. This situation inevitably increases the level of risk which will be
mitigated by outsourcing financial management, and appropriate internal control procedures at all levels.
Accordingly, the audit requirements will be commensurate with the design of the Project's overall financial
management structure and level of risk. The Project's consolidated annual financial statements and
statement of expenditures will be audited by independent external auditors acceptable to IDA according to
detailed terms of reference approved by IDA. This audit will also cover controls on the monthly
expenditure reports submitted by line Departments and DACs. Audits of the community and other local
implementing entities will be performed on a random sample basis. In addition, all sub-projects financed for
an amount greater than the equivalent of US$50,000 (subject to be reviewed depending on project
performance) will be systematically audited and reported on by the auditors. The auditors' report should be
submitted to IDA no later than six months after the end of a fiscal year. The auditors' report should include
a management letter to be issued at the end of their audit.

Annex No.: 11
MONITORING AND EVALUATION ANNEX
11.1. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) results will be used as key benchmarks to indicate whether or not
the project objectives and targets have been achieved. Given the nature of this project, emphasis will be put
on monitoring during the initial phase. The results of the M&E activities will guide adjustments and
modifications during the project implementation period. The Key Performance Indicators contained in the
Project Development Objective of this document as well as the Logical Framework (see Annex 1) will form
the basis of designing and administering the M&E tools. The objectives and targets to be achieved during
project implementation will be further refined under the Govemmenfs medium term HIV/AIDS Strategy
that will be finalized during the first year of the HARRP.
11.2. The implementation of project activities will be monitored by the National HIV/AIDS Secretariat
(NAS). The NAS/Planning and Monitoring Specialist (who will be recruited early in the staffing of the
NAS), will determine what is to be monitored and which kinds of evaluation will be done at various levels
of activity. S/he will compile and consolidate, on a quarterly basis, monitoring information including data
related to expenditure and disbursement levels (the latter information will be provided by the Financial
Management Agent). The NAS Planning and Monitoring Specialist will rely on formal links with extemal
participants for expertise in, and the generation of, M&E information and analysis, including the Central
Statistical Office, the DOSH/Epidemiological and Statistical Unit, Divisional and Municipal reporting
units, NGOs, private institutions. and other development partners.
11.3 For progress on achieving the project objectives, NAS will focus on the indicators that have been
spelled out in the section on Key Performance Indicators and that are consistent with the Logical
Framework. In general, NAS will develop, approve, and/or make use of, a data collection system
appropriate to monitor the progress of the project with regard to three major yardsticks, namely:
(1)   Increasing the percentage of 15 to 24 year olds with access to HIV/AIDS Information,
Education & Communication        (IEC/BCC) and services;
(2)    The rate of prevalence of HIV among 15 to 24 year olds (currently comparatively low);
and
(3)    The rate of prevalence of HIV among pregnant women (also currently comparatively low).
11.4 NAS will distinguish in its monitoring data collection and analysis between: (a) program outputs; (b)
progress towards outcomes (i.e. process indicators); and (c) early indications of trends towards longer term
impact. The following constitute the summary indicators for outputs, process, and impact of the program.
These indicators are in line with those proposed by UNAIDS in its June 2000 National AIDS Programmes:
A Guide to Monitoring and Evaluation, (UNAIDS/00. 1 7E):
A. Output Indicators
1. At least 50% of population reached through IEC/BCC programs on WHV/AIDS.
2. At least 5 key line Departments are implementing agreed action plans.
3. The number of sentinel surveillance sites increased by 2 in Project Year 1 and to a total of 8 by the
end of the project.
- 73 -



4. Community and Civil Society Initiatives (CCSI) disbursements reach at least 75% of planned
levels.
5. Access to treatment for STI, TB, and other opportunistic infections available in at least 20% by
end of the project.
B. Process Indicators
6. The National HIV/AIDS Council (NAC) fully functioning and National HIV/AIDS Strategy and
Plan of Action adopted.
7. All seven Divisional HIV/AIDS Committees and Municipality equivalents start implementation of
HARRP activities by the end of Project Year 2.
8. Voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services incorporated into antenatal, TB, and STI services
in 50% of health facilities in Western Division by the end of Year I and in 50% of health facilities
in the other divisions by Year 5.
C. Impact Indicators
9. At least 90% of the population (aged 15-49) aware of HIV/AIDS transmission modes and means
of prevention by end of the Project.
10. Use of condoms at last sexual contact among young people ( 15-24) will have increased by 40% by
the end of the project.
11. Prevalence rates of HIV and STI contained to present levels.
11.5  The NAS/M&E Specialist will also prepare consolidated semi-annual implementation reports for
the overall HARRP program. These implementation progress reports will be submitted every six months to
the National HIV/AIDS Council as well as to IDA. Performance evaluation of the program will be
conducted every year and will focus on: (i) an assessment of the short term impact of program activities on
the HIV/AIDS epidemic, with particular focus on vulnerable groups; and (ii) an operational audit of the
program, including activity completion, impact of activities and progress towards sustaining activities. This
evaluation will highlight the lessons learned and will be used to improve the efficiency of program
implementation, to make adjustments to annual work plans, and to identify improvements for content and
implementation procedures for future activities.
11.6   As to the Community and Civil Society Initiatives activities, M&E activities will be contracted out
either nationally or in smaller packages, and this will cover not only quantitative but qualitative monitoring,
e.g. indicators of progress developed by social groups and/or communities. Since the objective of many
Community and Civil Society Initiatives activities will be to change the behaviorof a large number of
disparate groups over the short, medium and long term, a process of beneficiary and stakeholder feedback
and of social impact monitoring is considered important to the success of the project. In this regard, a series
of key social impact aspects will be followed (to complement outputs, process, and impact indicators
already mentioned):
(a) Identification of key social and cultural development issues:
* Linking the key social and cultural development issues regarding STI and HIV/AIDS, particularly with

regard to the outcomes for the poor, youth, women, PLWHAs, and other vulnerable groups; and
* Establishing mitigation plans if the project is found to have adverse impact on social groups.
(b) Evaluation of institutional and social organizational issues:
* Identifying impediments to equitable access to project activities for intended beneficiary groups,
especially those that are currently not empowered and/or face other obstacles; and
* Recommending strategies for strengthening institutional capacity. These are especially relevant for vital
implementation mechanisms of the project that are not well developed and for personnel that are
unaccustomed to designing and implementing activities such as those envisaged under the project.
(c) Definition of a participation framework:
o Linking the key social and cultural development issues regarding STI and HIV/AIDS, particularly with
regard to the participationof the poor, youth, women, PLWHAs, and other vulnerable groups; and
* Identifying stakeholders whose participation in the project is of strategic importance, including those who
hold power over vulnerable groups.
