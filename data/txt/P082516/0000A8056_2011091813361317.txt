                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Government of DRC has a higher level objective of slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS in the general population. The project will support the Government by (i)
                         increasing the access to STI and HIV/AIDS treatment; (ii) mitigating the health and socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS at the individual, household, and
                         community level; and (iii) building strong and sustainable national capacity to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         After a four month extension, the project officially closed on May 31, 2011. A grace period of four months have been granted to finalize the pending payment and address critical
