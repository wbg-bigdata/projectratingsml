F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objective of the MAP/PMLS is to mitigate the negative impact of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic on the stabilization, recovery, and development of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC). This will be achieved by:
 (i) Reducing the risk of sexual, intravenous and vertical transmission of HIV;
 (ii) Improving the health status and quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS; and


                                                ii
  (iii) Mitigating the socio-economic impact of the epidemic on vulnerable groups.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
Government of DRC has a higher level objective of slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS in
the general population. The project will support the Government by (i) increasing the
access to STI and HIV/AIDS treatment; (ii) mitigating the health and socio-economic
impact of HIV/AIDS at the individual, household, and community level; and (iii)
building strong and sustainable national capacity to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) officially recognized
the existence of HIV/AIDS in 1984, thus becoming one of the first African countries to
acknowledge the danger of the epidemic.
2. However, as a result of the pillaging that occurred from 1991 to 1993 (which robbed
the National AIDS Control Program of all its equipment) and the cessation of
international cooperation (resulting in the departure of the major donors and research
teams), the fight against HIV/AIDS nearly came to a halt from 1990 to 1999.
3. The effort to fight AIDS began again in 1999 with the preparation of the National
Strategic Plan (1999-2008) to Combat HIV/AIDS (NSP).1 Its aim was to support the
development of the country by controlling the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and by
mitigating its impact on individuals, families, and the community. Moreover, in
accordance with the objectives pursued by earlier plans, the purpose of NSP was to
design the necessary mechanisms in all sectors of national life in order to reduce the
spread of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and to minimize their impact on
the community. A National Multisectoral Committee to Combat AIDS (CNMLS) was
established in the Ministry of Health in 2001.2
4.    Beyond the NSP, the Government’s primary focus on HIV/AIDS was once again
demonstrated during the preparation of the 2002 Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (I-PRSP), as one of the long-term objectives of the strategy was to improve living
conditions for the Congolese people.
5.    Since the re-engagement of the World Bank in 2001, the HIV/AIDS problem has
been reframed. The first actions of the comprehensive control effort were financed by the
Bank in the amount of US$8 million under the NSP framework to support the
Government’s multisectoral strategy. This strategy was defined well before this approach
was internationally accepted.
6.     It was remarkable to note that DRC had already a national strategic plan and a
HIV/AIDS coordination structure when the project was prepared. During the preparatory
phase the Bank and the client agreed: (i) to replace the National Committee with the
National Multisectoral Committee to Combat AIDS (CNMLS), which was placed under
the responsibility of the President of the Republic;3 (ii) to take exceptional steps to
implement the project, including the subcontracting of administrative and management
responsibilities; and (iii) to use multiple execution agencies, including non-governmental

  Decree No. 1250/CAB/MIN/S/AJ/KIZ/015/2001 of December 9, 2001, created a National Multisectoral Committee to
Combat AIDS (CNMLS) in the Ministry of Health, with wide representation from the main public and private
stakeholders, to supervise and coordinate the implementation of the National Strategic Plan. It replaced CNLS, which
had been set up on May 28, 1987.

organizations (NGOs) and umbrella groups. Thus, DRC was able to meet the four
conditions needed to access Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for Africa (MAP) II
funds.
7.      It is within the above context that the Project concept note was first drafted in
2003 and approved in January 2004. This was shortly after the 2002 fragile political
agreement for a transition Government intended to last for three years. The Project was
formulated at the time when the Bank considered HIV was a “development issue? and not
solely or predominantly a “health issue?. This was partly reflected in the fact that the first
TLL of the project came from the agriculture sector and was a strong advocate for
community engagement.
8.      It’s also important to note that the project concept and appraisal preceded the
engagement of the Global Fund (GF) and PEPFAR, and certainly well before either were
able to provide any resources to the fight against HIV in DRC. The presence of these new
and significant donors in DRC captivated the attention of the Government and drew
heavily on the limited human resources available in the health sector. The GF created a
new entity, the Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM), which was under the MOH
control and not under the National AIDS Authority (PNLMLS) created earlier by the
Government with Bank’s assistance.
9.    At the time of project preparation, the entire health system of the country was in
shambles in post-conflict era and this situation didn’t improve throughout project’s
implementation. Indeed, expenditure on health per capita is currently at $13 and the total
expenditure on health as a percentage of GPD was just 2% in 2009 (WHO, Global Health
Observatory, 2009). These figures are very low even by African standards.
10.     Besides, the nature of the HIV epidemic in the country was not well understood.
HIV prevalence was unknown and it was unclear what was driving the epidemic at the
time of Project appraisal.
1.2    Original project development objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
11.      Originally, the development objective was to mitigate the negative impact of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic on the country’s growth, by: (i) Reducing the risk of sexual,
intravenous and vertical transmission of HIV; (ii) Improving the health status and quality
of life of people living with HIV/AIDS; and (iii) Mitigating the socio-economic impact of
the epidemic on vulnerable groups. The original key performance indicators (KPI) of the
project are presented in the table below.

 1.3 Revised (and approved) project development objectives (PDO) and Key
 Indicators, and reasons/justification
 12.      The project went through two approved restructurings. The first one, done in July
 2007, was a generic umbrella regional restructuring. This restructuring was not
 addressing any specific implementation problem nor responding to information
 associated with a better understanding of the epidemiology of HIV in the country. Rather,
 it was meant to take into account: (i) change in the international environment with regard
 to the fight against HIV/AIDS, in particular the experiences with other MAPs and (ii) the
 need to harmonize MAP indicators across countries.
 13. During the 2007 restructuring, the objectives of the project were modified by
 agreement between the Government and the International Development Association
 (IDA). The new project development objective (PDO) was to assist the Recipient in: (i)
 increasing access to STI and HIV/AIDS treatment; (ii) mitigating the health and socio-
 economic impact of HIV/AIDS at the individual, household, and community level; and
 (iii) building strong and sustainable national capacity to respond to the HIV/AIDS
 epidemic.
 14. For the June 2010 restructuring, the PDO was not changed at all. The aims of the
 restructuring was to: (i) separate the functions of the coordinator of the Bank project
 implementation unit and the coordinator of the national body responsible for HIV/AIDS
 programs, in order to allow more focus on project implementation and at the same time
 ensuring sustainability of the national response ; (ii) modify activities under the
 community component to shift them from multiple community micro-projects to
 community outreach programs using a limited number of large actors ; (iii) revise the
 project’s key indicators and targets to adjust them to the revised project activities and
 address the current difficulties in obtaining some of the data ; and (iv) reallocation of
 budget categories into a single expenditure category for the uncommitted resources of
 the loan to facilitate disbursement as the project nears completion.
 15. During the two restructuring exercises (2007 and 2010), the original Key
 Performance Indicators were modified/replaced as follows in table 2.

1.3    Main beneficiaries
16. The original intended beneficiaries of the project were the general population and
vulnerable groups in particular. Gradually, the country further refined the target
populations to include the prison population, people living with HIV (PLWHA),
displaced persons (especially women), orphans and other vulnerable children (OVC);
persons working in dangerous conditions, such as men in uniform, truckers, and miners;
and groups in which the prevalence of infection was rapidly increasing, namely, young
people and women.
1.4    Original components
17. Component 1: Response of the public sector - US$40.4 million. Under this
component, the project had to assist and support the mobilization of public institutions in
the fight against the epidemic by mainstreaming HIV/AIDS activities in their regular
work program. The component was further structured into two sub-components: (a)
Program of the Ministry of Health (US$21.1 million), and (b) Program of the other
ministries (US$19.3 million).
18. Component 2: Response of the non-governmental sector - US$l7.9 million. This
component had two sub-components: a) Private sector entities/Public enterprises
(US$7.3 million) and b) NGOs, faith-based organizations, professional associations
(US$l0.6 million).
19. Component 3: Support for community initiatives - US$l9.3 million. The
component’s objective was to increase the impact of HIV/AIDS activities by transferring
the responsibility for identifying priorities, and preparing and implementing micro-
projects directly to the beneficiaries in rural and urban areas.
20. Component 4: Coordination & Communication (US$11.3million), monitoring
and evaluation (US$8 million), capacity building (US$3.2 million) - Total: US$22.5
million. This component had three sub-components: (a) Coordination and
Communication; (b) Monitoring and evaluation, and (c) Capacity-building/Technical
Studies).
1.5    Revised components
21. The components were not formally revised during the implementation of the
project despite the revision of the project development objectives during the 2007
restructuring.
1.6    Other significant changes
22. During the execution of the project, the original loan agreement was amended
several times in order to: (i) modify the fiduciary procedures; (ii) revise the development
objective and project outcome indicators; and (iii) reallocate project funds. One
amendment to extend the project closing date from January 31, 2011 to May 31, 2011
was approved.
23. Procedures were also modified: (i) in April 2009, to raise the prior review
thresholds for procurement; and (ii) in June 2010, to reallocate the remaining amounts in
various budget categories into a single category in order to facilitate disbursement of the
unspent funds.


                                             5
24. The project development objective was revised in July 2007 following the
restructuring of eight MAP projects; and indicators were modified: (i) in July 2007,
solely on the basis of the first umbrella restructuring of the project; and (ii) in June 2010,
following the outcome of the mid-term review and gaps identified in the definition of the
indicators and availability of data.

2. Key factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
Preparation
25.    During the preparatory phase of the Project, the Bank team spent tremendous
amount of time trying to understand the context under which the project would be
implemented. Several visits were organized all over the country including pre-concept,
concept, pre-appraisal and appraisal missions even in Eastern Congo which was still
extremely unstable at the time. The preparatory budget (PHRD US$959,029) was
substantial and was used to develop various aspects of the Project including the::
¾      Socioeconomic and environmental assessments (US$177,545);
¾       Development of appropriate operational design, mechanisms, and instruments for
efficient project implementation , supervision, and monitoring ($300,980);
¾      Strengthening the capacity and ownership of key implementing entities
($223,220);
¾      Feasibility studies on designing innovative approaches ($166,500); and
¾      Other studies needed for the preparation of the Project ($90,784).
26. Preparatory activities continued throughout 2002 and 2003. They focused on: (i)
evaluating the capacities of sectors to be included in the project; and (ii) developing
manuals of procedures for the project in general and the component related to community
initiatives in particular (with a study on monetary transfer modalities in localities having
no access to banks). Despite all these studies, there was no epidemiological analysis
carried out to better understand the nature of the HIV epidemic and this was one of the
weaknesses of the preparation process.
27. Lessons learned during the field visits around the entire country, including zones
still at war in the Eastern parts of the country, were used to shape the design of the
project. However, more PPF funds should have been used to collect the necessary
baseline data that were to be used as reference to evaluate the performance of the project.
28. The project was consistent with the objectives o f the Transitional Support Strategy
(TSS) approved by the Bank in 2001. The TSS had to support the Government’s goal to:
(i) consolidate peace, (ii) stabilize the macroeconomic and fiscal framework, (iii)
improve governance; and (iv) rebuild social services and meet basic needs.




                                              6
Design
29. Given the situation in DRC and the requirements of MAP II, the project was
designed to support the implementation of the National Strategic Plan to Combat AIDS in
all the provinces of the country, in both rural and urban areas, and in a variety of sectors.
30. The original project’s objectives were realistic given the scientific knowledge
available at the time of project’s appraisal. The original objectives were appropriate in
terms of their ability to achieve the PDOs. However, when the project was revised in
2007, one of the objectives was to increase access to STI and HIV/AIDS treatment.
Access to STI shouldn’t have been included as an objective because at that time there
was compelling evidence that the treatment of STIs had no proven impact on mitigating
HIV infection.
Quality at Entry
31. A quality enhancement review (QER) of the proposed project was conducted in
November 2003. The QER identified the following problems: (i) the loan amount seemed
too big given the country’s problems with disbursement and the amounts expected from
the Global Fund; (ii) the likely overlap of responsibilities between PNMLS and the other
structures involved in fighting HIV/AIDS was identified as a problem for smooth project
implementation as well as (iii) the weak technical capacity of the implementing agency.
32. The results framework also suffered from insufficient baseline data and from
indicators that were not clearly defined. One consequence of this was that targets for
some indicators were defined based on guesses rather than on knowledge of the true
situation of the HIV/epidemic. Indicators were later revised during the two restructuring
exercises to be more specific.
2.2 Implementation
33. The most significant factor which affected the implementation of the Project was
the inadequate management capacity at the central level, coupled with extensive
leadership turn-over. The project has known five TTLs on the Bank’s side; and five
Ministers of Health and four different Managers (project Coordinators) of the
Implementing Agency (PNMLS). The management capacity at the central level
(PNMLS) was hampered by the inability to change the poorly performing leadership.
This was due to internal rivalries within government entities, especially between the
Office of the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Health regarding who had the power to
change the leadership. Two of the PNMLS Managers were in acting position for long
periods of time hampering their ability to take decisive necessary actions to improve the
project implementation.
34. The second factor influencing implementation was the insufficient attention given
to decentralized supervisory and capacity building responsibilities as well as the weak
programmatic, technical and fiduciary capacity at decentralized levels.
35. Besides the extensive turn-over of Bank TTLs, when the Project was launched,
there was a management decision to have the first TTL based in Washington without a
dedicated staff person in-country. Such a person was needed on the ground at the outset
of the project implementation given the particular nature of the country (huge and



                                             7
diverse), and the sectoral politics. Moreover, the project required coordination with other
development partners.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization
M&E Design
36. During the preparatory phase, the PAD had proposed sharing monitoring and
evaluation responsibilities between: (i) surveillance, for which the Ministry of Health
would be responsible, possibly assisted by national institutes and laboratories and
technical partners; (ii) sectoral health activities (blood transfusion, treatment of STIs,
PMCT, IO, among others), for which the technical programs of the Ministry of Health
would be responsible; (iii) activities to be carried out by PNMLS, assisted by provincial
coordinators and grant recipients; and (iv) financial management, for which FMA would
be responsible, assisted by the Bank (for the Risk-Sharing Facility (RSF) review) and
internal and external auditors. This may have appeared reasonable on paper but in
practice it was unclear who in the end was in charge of coordinating the overall M&E
system.
37. The M&E normative framework, considered as a National Monitoring and
Evaluation plan, governs and regulates the implementation of the national monitoring and
evaluation system and lists the national indicators applicable to all actors involved in
combating HIV/AIDS in DRC. However, the project indicators were not fully in
accordance with the national indicators. This was due to the fact that the MAP had its
own set of core indicators that were to be used by all countries benefiting from this
program.
M&E Implementation and use
38. The adoption of the M&E framework was followed by an action plan, guides for
indicators, and training tools and manuals. However, the data collected have not been
systematically analyzed and processed.
39. At the PNMLS level, several factors have negatively affected the availability of
technical and financial data, namely: (i) the weak capacities of decentralized bodies to
document data on completed activities; and (ii) the lack of sufficient qualified technical
staff, supplies, and working tools.
40. With regard to financial data, PNMLS has reliable information going back to the
beginning of the project, and has had analytical tools since it began to use the accounting
software TOMPRO in 2008.
2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance
41. Environment and management of medical waste: At the time of appraisal, the
project was listed under category B, given the risks involved in medical waste
management for medical personnel and the communities surrounding health facilities. A
plan was prepared and approved by the Bank in December 2003. There is a Health Sector
Rehabilitation Support Project which has a medical waste management plan that covers
HIV/AIDS activities. Therefore, the project didn’t need to duplicate efforts to implement
its own medical waste management plan.



                                             8
42. Procurement: Despite the recruitment of an agency responsible for procurement
(PWC – Price Water House Coopers - which assumed at the same time the fiduciary
responsibilities), the supervisory mission of March 2006 observed weaknesses linked to
factors such as: (i) lack of understanding of procurement procedures in general; (ii)
ignorance of the procedures set forth in the loan agreement (IS IT A LOAN OR A
CREDIT AGREEMENT?); and (i) implementation of provisions and procedures contrary
to the provisions of the loan agreement SAME QUESTION. The recruitment of an
additional procurement expert in 2007 helped to gradually improve the capacities of the
project, which have been rated as moderately satisfactory or satisfactory since June 2008.
After the 2008 Institutional Audit, the fiduciary and procurement roles were separated
and a procurement unit was created within the PNMLS and the fiduciary element was
assumed by a new FMA, the KMPG.
43. Financial management and disbursement: On the basis of the analysis
contained in the PAD, the risks posed by financial management, given the country's post-
conflict situation and the complexity of the project, were considered high. The
recruitment of the fiduciary management agency (FMA), the opening of various special
accounts, the elaboration of detailed procedural manuals, and the hiring of external
auditors (for the technical and financial aspects) helped somewhat in reducing these risks.
However, the supervisory mission of March 2006 revealed that the fiduciary management
of the project did not meet the minimum standards for rigor and transparency generally
required in projects financed by the World Bank.
44. The situation has remained critical for almost two years. Another World Bank
supervisory mission in October 2008 judged the financial performance of the project to
be very unsatisfactory, in view of: (i) the existence of significant but non-reimbursed
ineligible expenditures for more than two years; (ii) lack of adequate budgetary
management; (iii) persistent weaknesses in the control system, linked to organizational
dysfunction; and (iv) the poor performance of the outgoing FMA (PWC). It was not until
December 2009 that financial management was rated satisfactory under the auspice of
the new FMA, the KPMG (Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler) accounting firm.
45. The final financial supervision visit found that the project has complied with the
obligations of financial reporting and auditing. However, according to the financial
supervision report, the fiduciary risk remains substantial and performance in financial
management was considered moderately unsatisfactory. In addition, according to the
financial mission findings, the financial losses of the project are estimated (May 27,
2011) to be USD 7.86 million comprising: (i) USD 2.78 million not recovered from the
initial deposit in the designated accounts of, (ii) the over- commitment of USD 2.54
million due to an acceleration of commitments and payments in the last month before the
original closing date of the project, (iii) related expenses deemed not to conform to the
agreements signed in 2005 of USD 1.78 million, and (iv) disputed claims by the PNMLS
of USD 0.76 million. Given the problem with this over commitment, the financial
management should have been rated unsatisfactory.
2.5 Post-completion Operations/Next Phase
46. Despite the difficulties encountered during its implementation, the project
contributed to a number of activities that could assist future efforts to combat HIV/AIDS.


                                            9
With regard to the strategic and regulatory framework, the country has a national plan for
the period 2010-2014 and operational plans at the provincial level. The national plan
recognizes the complex nature of the epidemic and confirms the principles and
approaches that should guide the effort to control HIV/AIDS in the coming years. At the
legislative level, Act No. 06/18 of July 20, 2006, on the protection of the rights of
PLWHA, could help attenuate discrimination in DRC.
47. At the institutional level, the recent separation of political and strategic
responsibilities from project coordination functions in PNMLS is a step that has been
anticipated since the preparatory phase of the project. This was long overdue since it was
one of the recommendations of the 2008 Institutional Audit.
48. Technically speaking, the project's support for MODs (Delegated Management
Contracts) in prevention activities (condom distribution, community awareness-raising,
blood transfusion), purchase of inputs (STI and ARV drugs), and building of provincial
capacities should contribute to the sustainability of the project activities, at least in the
short term.
49. Also the Bank has submitted an AF request to the Board for the Health Sector
Rehabilitation Support project in which part of the funds are requested as an interim
arrangement while waiting for availability of other sources of funding HIV activities in
the future, including probably from the Global Fund.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance of objectives
50. The relevance of the three original project’s objectives as well as two of the
revised project’s objectives are rated substantial and one revised objective (which
include treatment of STI) is rated modest. The objectives rated are consistent with the
current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS 2008 – 2011) in which fighting the spread of
HIV/AIDS and promoting community dynamics are two of the five pillars which reflect
the same pillars in the country’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy Paper (PRGSP).
However, after restructuring, one of the three new PDOs (increasing the access to STI
and HIV/AIDS treatment) was moderately relevant because at the time of the
restructuring it was common knowledge that there is no direct link between treating STI
and mitigating HIV.
Relevance of design and implementation
51. The relevance of design and implementation is rated modest before and after the
restructuring. The four components of the project at appraisal (which remained the same
after the two restructurings) would have achieved the intended development objective if
they had been effectively and efficiently implemented. However, the Project was too
ambitious in its efforts to be implemented country-wide rather than choosing a limited
number of provinces where the Project could have maximized its impact.
52. Little progress towards the Project’s development objectives was achieved at the
time of the 2007 restructuring. There had already been fiduciary problems and the project


                                              10
 was partially frozen for 16 months. Instead of taking this opportunity to address the
 country specific problems (and eventually revise the components and reorient the project
 in terms of design and implementation arrangements) the restructuring focused instead on
 harmonizing MAPs across countries. This was a missed opportunity to better address the
 needs of the country with regard to new available evidence in HIV/AIDS mitigation (e.g
 concentration on most-at-risk populations, geographic concentration, etc…).
 53. Although the Project’s budget is relatively large ($102 million), it is unclear
 whether the project, as designed to cover the entire territory of Congo with enormous
 challenges travelling to some areas of the country, could effectively and efficiently
 achieve the stated development objectives. Also the Project may have underestimated the
 challenges (monetary and technical efforts) in building the capacity of decentralized
 entities in a post-conflict country.
 54. As discussed earlier, the implementation of the Project suffered from limited
 technical and managerial capacity at both the central and decentralized levels. The
 implementation suffered as well from a relatively long period of frozen funds due to
 fiduciary problems with the first FMA.
 3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives
 55. Too many changes of indicators made it difficult to follow them through and the
 absence of baseline data made the situation worse and the inability to collect information
 on some of them didn’t help either. After the 2007 restructuring, some of the data on
 original indicators were no longer collected as planned at appraisal. For example, no data
 is available on the share of sex workers using condoms at their last sexual intercourse.

                                                 11
 56. The indicator on the number of people who visited VCT centers (302,308) was by
 far surpassed both for the targets before (1,500) and after restructuring (25,000).
 57. By 2007, when the data on PMTCT coverage was being collected, the coverage
 was at 32.6% for the country (168 health zones out of 515 were covered in PMTCT
 services for pregnant women). This is the same for the indicator on STI cases treated
 according to national norms. The target was achieved at more than 200%.
 58. With regard to the percent of donated blood tested for HIV and hepatitis, it was
 estimated in 2007 that 79% of health zones were covered in terms of blood transfusion,
 but only 52% were tested for these infections.
 59. Only two of the five outcome indicators for PDO1 were achieved, two others were
 close to their targets; no data was available for one of the indicators. The effectiveness of
 original PDO1 is therefore rated modest.
 b)      Original PDO 2: Quality of life of PLWHA improved

available


 60. The number of PLWHA who received quality medical treatment in zones covered
 by the Project was far below the original target.
 61. The percentage of health zones which had community services for PLWHA is
 unknown because data on the indicator ceased to be collected after the 2007 restructuring
 (indicator was dropped).
 62. The achievement of original PDO 2 is therefore rated negligible given the limited
 ability to achieve the first indicators under this PDO and the impossibility to measure the
 second one.

 populations is mitigated

 63. It is difficult to measure the percentage of OVC assisted with tuition and schooling
 because the total number in need of the services is not determined for DRC. By the end of
 2009, a cumulative number of 36,292 OVC had been assisted with schooling support
 (with 57% coming from direct Project’s contributions.
 64. With regard to the indicator on reduced discrimination against PLWHA, according
 to DHS results (2007), only 9% of the Congolese people have a tolerant attitude toward
 PLHIV; the MICS 3 study (2009), which uses another method of calculation, arrived at
 nearly the same conclusion (7% tolerance level). The project’s original development
 objective has not been met.
 65.    The achievement of original PDO 3 is therefore rated negligible.


 d)      Revised PDO 1: Increase access to STI and HIV/AIDS treatment
 66. As shown in table 6 below, four of the six revised PDO 1 outcome indicators were
 achieved when the 2010 restructuring targets are considered. However, when compared
 to the 2007 restructuring targets, only one indicator (number of condoms distributed) was
 achieved, four indicators were not achieved and no data for one indicator was available
 (number of service outlets carrying out blood safety activities).
 67. The target for the number of pregnant women living with HIV who receive ARVs
 to reduce the risk of MTCT changed from being expressed as a percentage to a number
 after the second restructuring. In terms of its achievement, the country was far from
 reaching the target. Only 3.7% of pregnant women in need of ARV received it in 2010,
 far from the 70% target set at the first restructuring. The indicator also fell short of the
 target set at the second restructuring (804 women put on ARV versus a target of 1,200).

 68. As for the indicator on the number of persons 15 years and older who receive
 counseling and testing for HIV and receive their results, the target numbers varied greatly
 between the two restructuring events. The target set towards the end of the Project in
 2010 (300,000) was achieved but fell short of the 2007 target (800,000).




                                                      14
    69. Data for the indicator on the number of service outlets carrying out blood safety
    activities is not available, but we know that 85% of the health zones (436 health zones in
    total) were providing blood transfusion services by the end of 2010. However, the
    number of units of blood collected by the end of 2010 was 322,295, well over the target
    set for the 2010 restructuring (200,000).
    70. The overall effectiveness of the first revised PDO 1 is rated Modest. Only two out
    of six indicators of the revised PDO 1 after the 2007 restructuring were achieved.
    Although four out of six of the indicators were achieved after the 2010 restructuring, one
    may have the impression that the 2010 restructuring had the ultimate goal of making the
    Project’s achievements of the PDOs look good.

3.3    Efficiency
73.     Some elements of design and implementation may have contributed to the
reduction of the project’s efficiency. The desire to provide funds for each component of
the NHA Plan rather than focusing on a few critical thematic areas certainly diluted the
Project’s capacity to efficiently achieve its development objectives. The same is true for
the ambitious scope of the project to cover the entire country rather than concentrating
efforts on a carefully chosen limited number of provinces.
74. There were also problems of allocative efficiency. Only 40% of the funds were
originally allocated to the component focusing on the response to the public sector,
knowing that the entire country’s health system was very weak in the aftermath of the
conflict. This was made worse in actual spending, as the percentage of the funding level
for this important area fell to 29.6% when Coordination and Communication took a lion
share of about 48.6% in actual spending. The allocative efficiency became even more
problematic after the second restructuring in 2010 just three months before the original
closing of the Project. The reallocation of funds was partially made to ensure the Project
funds would be used by the closing date without regard to effectiveness.
75. In terms of cost-effectiveness, although the exact cost per each output/outcome
indicators was unavailable, it is clear that spending $54 million over the life of the project
to put 7,940 patients on ARV, treat a cumulative number of 804 pregnant women on
ARV to prevent PMTCT, assist a cumulative number of 38,299 with schooling, and
provide just over 100,000 STI treatments per year was well over the expected acceptable
costs for alternatives. As an example, on average in other countries, in 2004 the cost of
treating one patient by ARV was $1,100 per year (it subsequently dropped to $355 by
2009). It costs around $2 per STI case treated and $150 per pregnant women put on ARV
to prevent transmission to babies. Adding to the burden of these costs, 25 million
condoms burned in the warehouses of the Federation of the National Pharmaceutical
Procurement Centers (FEDECAME – Federation des Centres d’Achat des Medicaments)
which has its insurance and compensation process is underway.
76. The net present value of the project interventions couldn’t be determined because it
is calculated in the PAD based on the reduction in HIV prevalence. It is now known that
new advances in HIV mitigation (scaling up PMTCT and full scale ARV treatment for all
HIV positive) could have an impact on the prevalence, stabilizing it or even increasing it
by increasing survival among PLWHA. In addition, the true prevalence of HIV in the
general population is unknown.
77. Given the above facts, the efficiency of the Project is rated negligible both before
and after the restructuring.

 78.     Summary of ratings, by components
 79. OPCS guidelines for outcome rating of a project with formally revised project
 objectives recommend using a weighting system that takes into account the performance
 of the project in achieving its development objectives before and after the restructuring as
 well as the level of disbursement associated with each period. We used this system to rate
 this project outcome in the tables below.

 3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
 80. On the basis of the ratings above on the relevance of objectives, design and
 implementation, the achievement of the project development objective and the project
 efficiency, the overall outcome rating of the project is unsatisfactory.
 3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, gender Aspects, and Social Development
 81. The fight against HIV/AIDS and STI has always been one of the five pillars of the
 poverty reduction and growth strategy in DRC (PRGSP). With most Congolese families
 living below the poverty line, and with the population constantly growing every year, the
 country has found it enormously difficult to take care of its most vulnerable people. The
 promulgation of Act No. 08/011 of July 14, 2011, on the protection of people living with
 or affected by HIV/AIDS, which governs the national HIV/AIDS policy in DRC,
 represents the State’s effort to deal with the poorest and most vulnerable groups.
 82. Various studies and surveys have revealed the growing feminization of the
 epidemic, and the project has funded ministries and NGOs specializing in interventions
 for women. Priorities built into the Project such as those related to PMTCT and some of
 specific CSO-supported activities contributed to enhanced attention to girls and women.
 (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
 83. The AIDS Coordinating Authority (PNMLS) has been extensively supported by
 the Project from early days. Also, the project helped consolidate and strengthen the
 capacities of decentralized bodies (in all provinces and in ten districts) and of hundreds of
 NGOs, umbrella groups, and communities.
 (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
 84.   No unintended outcome and impact to report.
 3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiaries Survey and/or Stakeholders Workshops
 85.   Beneficiary survey/stakeholder workshop not done

 4. Assessment of risks Development outcome
 86. The risk that the results of the project will not be sustainable after it closes is
 considered Substantial.


                                                 18
87. The sustainability of development outcomes achieved by the Project is not
guaranteed. For example, the financing of MOD has certainly contributed to the results,
but perhaps to the detriment of the improvement of health services, which at present
remain very weak to address HIV mitigation efforts alone.
88. Second, setting up coordinating bodies to carry out initiatives in the provinces has
established the presence of the national program, but the lack of a technical and financial
means will endanger the future of these structures and the priority activities they are
supposed to be carrying out.
89. Third, in a country where the financial resources for fighting HIV/AIDS are
provided almost exclusively by external sources, the continued pursuit of the project
objectives will be in jeopardy if the Government doesn’t put in its spending budget
resources for the HIV/AIDS fight.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
90. Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry, the Bank is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.
91. The preparatory phase occurred in the context of: (i) generalized poverty; (ii)
certain behaviors (precocious sexual relations, multi-partner sex, population mobility, and
others); (iii) a weak response to the epidemic owing to the prolonged conflict (especially
in the East) and the departure of international and national experts and financial resources,
(iv) weak central government, and (v) weak health systems at all levels. However, instead
of adapting the Project to the particular situation in DRC, the preparatory team adopted
and systematically applied the standard MAP country model.
92. The team analyzed the capacities of the public and private sectors and of NGOs,
but it did not study community-based organizations (CBOs). Moreover, certain critical
elements were not sufficiently taken into account: (i) institutional arrangements at the
central level (including with other partners, especially the Global Fund); (ii) the
decentralization modalities, in particular the definition of the roles and responsibilities of
provincial and district-level bodies; (iii) the difficulties of setting up a monitoring and
evaluation system; and (iv) the problem of human resources (including weak technical
capacities and abysmal wages in DRC).
93. Moreover, the preparatory phase had properly categorized the project risks as high,
but in reality, the mitigation measures were not strong enough to address the situation.
94. In addition, the results framework didn’t have baseline data for many of the
indicators and target setting for those indicators was not realistic and correct because it
was based on guesses rather than availability of reliable data on these indicators.




                                              19
95. At the document level, it was noted that the Bank did indeed provid the project
implementation team in DRC (a French speaking country) with a French version of the
PAD.
(b) Quality of Supervision
96.   The quality of supervision by the Bank was clearly unsatisfactory.
97. Relative to the length of the entire project (2004-2011), the number of official
supervision visits with Aide Memoires (six in all over seven years) was too low to have
any significant impact or to correct mistakes on time. During these few supervision visits,
the composition of the team was not always appropriate. The only available Aide
Memoire before the 2007 restructuring shows that the supervision done in March 2006
was composed only by the TTL on the side of the Bank, and a number of representatives
from other development agencies (CDC, UNICEF, WHO, UNAIDS). While
collaboration among partners is beneficial, a team made up almost exclusively of partners
could not necessarily detect inherent problems in project implementation. An M&E
Specialist is mentioned as a supervision team member only in the September 2009
supervision visit. Therefore, the poor monitoring arrangements and results framework
could not be addressed in time.
98. As discussed above, the 2007 restructuring did not address some of the real issues
the project was facing and the 2010 restructuring came too late to make any palpable
impact to achieve the project objectives.
99. During the same period, the project had five TTLs (average of 20 months per TTL).
This did not give any of them enough time to truly understand the realities of the
problems the project faced to find adequate solutions. Also, it appears the Bank
management was not interested in finding lasting solutions to a known problem project.
100. There were significant issues with financial management at the beginning of the
project which worsened toward the closing date. Legal actions undertaken following
these fiduciary problems by some of the implementing agencies are threatening the
current portfolio with legal orders to freeze special accounts of Bank-financed operations
in the country.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
101. The Bank performance is rated unsatisfactory because the weaknesses in the
preparation of the project considering the inappropriate geographic and activity-related
scope, the poor supervision of the operation and the inability to remove the project from
the "problem project" category.
5.2 Borrower's performance
(a) Government Performance
102. The Government’s performance was also rated unsatisfactory.
103. There was lack of leadership at the Government level, with internal rivalries
between key Government institutions (namely the office of the Prime Minister and the
Ministry of Health) responsible for parts of the project’s implementation. Likewise, lack




                                            20
of leadership at the coordinating body and weak technical capacity both at the central and
provincial levels hampered the proper implementation of the project.
104. There have also been too many changes in leadership at the Ministry of Health
(which had, in the beginning of the project, the chairmanship of the CNMLS). There
were five Ministers of Health during the course of the Project. Partly due to this reason,
during the entire project life, only two meetings of the CNMLS, the Multisectoral
Coordinating Body chaired by the Minister of Health, were held.
105. On the other hand, the capacity of the Ministry of Health, which was responsible
for a major part of the project activities, was constrained at both the central and
provincial levels. In addition, there was inadequate funding of recurrent costs and poor
remuneration of staff, making many projects exclusively dependent on external sources
of funding.
106. Political interference and corruption occurred in the process of selecting the
Coordinators of the National Coordinating Body (PNMLS) which delayed the hiring of
the first Coordinator for several months. Once in place, there were delays in removing
any Coordinator despite poor performance and delays in taking necessary actions to
improve project implementation pace.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
107.   The performance of the implementing agency is rated unsatisfactory.
108. Performance of implementing agencies was rated unsatisfactory given the long
period of poor performance by PWC, the over commitment issue along with managerial
problem, low technical capacity, poor performance and weak leadership at the PNMLS.
109. The responsibilities for executing the project were shared between: (i) the National
Multisectoral Program to Combat AIDS (PNMLS), created by Presidential Decree No.
04/029 of March 17, 2004; and (ii) the fiduciary management agency (PWC), which was
recruited through an international bidding process and was assigned responsibility for
procurement and financial management. It was ultimately replaced by the KPMG which
was in charge on the fiduciary management only and a separate procurement unit was
created at the PNMLS level.
110. According to the evaluations of the Bank’s ISRs, the performance of PNMLS has
been rated, with a few exceptions, moderately unsatisfactory since June 2006, despite the
project’s progress and the performance of the components of the response.
111. On the other hand, according to the evaluations of the Bank’s ISRs, the
performance of the initial FMA (PWC) was moderately unsatisfactory as a whole, but
with variations depending on the function and the period. The performance of the current
FMA (KPMG) has been satisfactory since December 2009 up until the January 2011
financial supervision visit. However, it is under the same KPMG that the Project
overcommitted more than $5 million towards the end of the Project.
(c) Justification for Rating of Overall Borrower Performance
112. Given the performance of the Government (unsatisfactory), PNMLS and the
FMAs (unsatisfactory), the Borrower's performance was rated unsatisfactory.



                                            21
6. Lessons learned
114. Lack of realism and phasing in a project design and implementation in a conflict
or post-conflict country can undermine the Project ability to achieve its development
objectives. This project undertook to cover the entire country after a conflict which left
the country with weak institutional systems. Identification of some hotspots along with
concentrating efforts in limited number of easily accessible provinces may have increased
the chance of the Project to achieve its development objectives. In a post-conflict country,
an in-depth understanding of initial institutional capacity and what mitigation options are
available should be part of project preparation.
115. In a post-conflict country, swift and frequent restructuring exercises may be
necessary in order to adapt the project design and implementation as the situation
changes and new data become available. This project was implemented at the beginning
as an emergency operation and as in many other operations of such nature, lack of data
that provides the evidence-base for an M&E framework and a clear results chain at the
outset can make it difficult to draw any causal relationship between observed/unobserved
results steaming from the Project activities.
116. Strict adherence to global project frameworks can undermine undertaking
necessary adjustments to adapt a project to the specific situation of a particular country.
Frameworks such as MAP, Avian Influenza, and Food crisis present the advantage that
once the Board has approve the framework, then it become easy to expedite project.
However, during implementation, a country’s specific context should prevail in order to
undertake necessary restructurings to maximize the chances to achieve the development
objectives.
117. In a country with particularly weak capacity, it is imperative to have a TTL in the
field at the onset of the Project and avoid frequent TTL changes. It takes at least one
full year for a TTL to better understand a project in depth and therefore an additional
couple of years at least are needed to ensure continuity and smooth implementation of the
project. The absence of a TTL on the ground at the outset of a Project in a conflict or
post-conflict country, with very weak structural systems, can critically affect the ability
of p0rojects to achieve their development objectives efficiently. The early presence of a
Bank team on the ground allows the TTL to identify problems early on and be more pro-
active in proposing necessary restructuring and adjustments to the project implementation.
In this regard, management needs to support The Project team in providing the needed
resources and time to undertake intensive Project modification.
118. Similarly, in weak capacity environments, the Bank needs to exercise intense
fiduciary oversight even when international firms have been hired to provide fiduciary
services. Given the ineligible payments and over-commitments that happened during the
project, hiring specialized FMA and implementing agencies alone may not be sufficient
for ensuring smooth technical and financial implementation of the project.
119. Donor driven projects from the beginning to the end without proper
incremental integration into the Government budget processes poses a substantial risk
to the sustainability of development outcomes. Lack of leadership and commitment in
monetary contribution by the Government has a negative impact on both the achievement
of the project development objectives and sustainability of achieved results and causes an


                                            22
acute problem when the project closes. Also, the creation of an independent coordinating
body outside the Ministry of Health can create some level of frustration which leads to
lack of ownership when the Project closes and the structure dissolves.

 114. Compared to the objective of reaching 50% of health zones, the project contributed
 to the coverage of 37% by 2010.
 115. Condom distribution: The results of condom distribution are presented in the
 following table.

 116. The project was able to meet the target of distributing 25 million condoms. The
 annual contribution from MAP has been somewhat variable, but it should be noted that
 the project has just bought 38.4 million condoms for distribution in the coming years.
 However, approximately 25 millions of these perished in a warehouse which caught fire
 before they were dispatched to respective Provinces for distribution.
 117. Number of persons who sought counseling and testing, and received the
 results, in the zones targeted by the project: The results, at country level and for the
 project as a whole, are shown in the following table:

 118. In terms of the objectives of providing services the target of the 2010 restructuring
 (300,000) was achieved but it was well below the 2010 restructuring target of 800,000.
 The original target at the project appraisal (25,000) was certainly an under estimate of
 what the Project could achieve.
 119. HIV seropositive pregnant women who benefited from all the services
 provided by PMCT: The results for the country program and for the project are
 presented in the following table:

 120. The indicator changed from being expressed as a percentage to becoming a number.
 The targets in percentages - 35% for original target and 70% for the 2007 restructuring -
 the country was far from achieving these targets (3.7% in 2010). With regard to the
 objective of treating 1,200 positive pregnant women in the project zone, the cumulative
 number, as at December 31, 2010, was 804.

 122. The project far exceeded the target of 50,000 (original target) and 100,000 (2010
 restructuring target) cases treated in accordance with national norms but it’s well below
 the 2007 restructuring target of 300,000.

 123. This indicator was achieved at 79.4% (7,940/10,000) with regard to the target set at
 the last restructuring in 2010 but certainly fall short below the target set for 2007 (70%)
 and the original target (20,000).

 125. The original target of controlling 60% of the blood supply in testing for HIV and
 Hepatitis B & C was achieved The same is true for the 2010 restructuring target of
 collecting 200,000 units of blood in accordance with national norms. The exact number
 of health facilities carrying out blood safety activities was unknown at the time of this
 ICR preparation.
 126. Building strong, sustainable national capacity to respond to the HIV/AIDS
 epidemic: This indicator has to do with the establishment, by the ministries targeted by
 the project, of a unit responsible for HIV/AIDS control. Since 2007, the eight ministries
 targeted by the project have established such a unit. Moreover, eight other ministries and
 Parliament have also set up HIV/AIDS units.
 Component 2: Response of the non-Governmental Sector and Component 3: Support
 to Community Initiatives
 127. Sex workers: Compared to the objective that 60% of sex workers targeted by the
 program report using condoms during their last sexual encounter, the 2007 DHS results




                                                30
 showed a result of 61.4%. The target has thus been met but the contribution of the
 Project to the achievement of this target is hard to ascertain.
 128. Orphans/OVC: With regard to the indicator target that 20% of orphans have
 received schooling or education provided by the project, the third Multiple Indicator
 Cluster Survey (MICS 3) (2009) confirms the figure of 63%. It’s not clear; however,
 what has been the contribution of the project to this indicator. As for the 2007 and 2010
 target of providing schooling to 15,000 orphans and other vulnerable children, the project
 has reached a cumulative number that surpasses the target.

 to at least 15,000 orphans and other vulnerable children over the past 12 months has not
 been met.
 130. Tolerant attitude: According to DHS results (2007), only 9% of the Congolese
 people have a tolerant attitude toward PLHIV; the MICS 3 study (2009), which uses
 another method of calculation, arrived at nearly the same conclusion (7% tolerance level).
 The project objective has not been met.

 131. The project was unable to reach the target in terms of supporting at least 5,000
 subprojects (sensitization and community support for PLHIV, among others). However,
 just looking at the number of sub-projects with no indication of how well they perform
 seems insufficient.
 Component 4: Coordination and communication, M&E, and capacity building
 132. The project has also: (i) arranged for coordination in all the provinces of DRC and
 in some districts; and (ii) financed training in various fields, including the management of
 programs to fight HIV/AIDS.

                 Borrower’s final report on DRC Multisectoral AIDS Project
141. The Borrower hired a consultant to prepare a final report on the DRC
Multisectoral AIDS project. The consultant tried to follow the layout of the Bank’s ICR.
We provide here the report’s main conclusions on the ratings and lessons learned.
1. Evaluation of results

1.1 Relevance of objectives, design and implementation

142. The relevance of the development objectives, components, and activities of the
project is rated Substantial for the initial project, Modest after the restructurings in 2007
and 2010, and Modest for the project as a whole.

143. Initial project (2004-2007). Given the technical orientations of the NSP and
PRGSP and the confirmation that the epidemic was generalized, the original objectives,
components, and activities of the project responded to lessons learned and accepted
practices. In addition to the emphasis on decentralization and a multisectoral approach,
the project stressed, in particular, the importance of building the capacities of participants
and ultimate beneficiaries so as to enable them to continue the activities on their own, in
a sustainable way. Despite the institutional and fiduciary problems encountered in
effectively implementing the planned structures and procedures, the objectives and
design of the project remained valid.

144. First restructuring (2007-2010). In the absence of a strategic plan for the period,
the plan for implementing the road map for universal access to HIV prevention, treatment,
care and support has been used as an interim document for the period 2006-2010.4 This
document again confirmed that the epidemic is: (i) generalized, with an HIV prevalence
rate (ages 15-49) estimated at 4.5%; and (ii) worsening among young people, women,
and rural dwellers in conflict zones.5

145. In addition, at the time of the 2007 restructuring, the country had incorporated the
fight against HIV/AIDS into its general development plans (PRGSP 2006-2025, CAF
2007-2010); and it had pursued its commitment with regard to universal access by
agreeing, through its priority action program (PAP, 2007-2010), to adopt a sustainable
financial strategy for providing ARV treatment to HIV patients.

146. The 2007 restructuring was meant to take into account: (i) new data on the status
of the epidemic in the country; (ii) changes in the international environment with regard


4
  In 2005, DRC had also prepared and adopted a plan to expand access to ARV treatments in DRC for the period 2005-
2009, under the 3 by 5 Initiative.

  See Feuille de Route (Road Map) (2006-2010), pp. 2-5.


                                                       41
to the fight against HIV/AIDS, in particular the experiences of other MAPs; (iii) the
increase in available financial resources and the need to harmonize them in accordance
with the "three ones;" and (iv) decisions aimed at strengthening project execution
procedures relating, in particular, to institutional arrangements and weaknesses in
administrative and financial management.

147. The restructuring did not, however, achieve the expected results. First of all, the
restructuring ignored the development objective related to prevention and added a
development objective linked to institution-building; but it did not revise the indicators,
so that many of them did not easily fit into the new logical framework of the project.
Moreover, this first restructuring did not actually result in any other changes.

148. Second restructuring (2010-2011). In 2008, a situational analysis6 revised the
assessment of the epidemic and concluded that it:
         was mixed, with: (i) a generalized component of about 1.2% to 1.5%;7 and (ii)
          a component characterized by high prevalence rates in certain population
          groups, in particular prostitutes, with 16.9% in 2004, soldiers (men 3.8%;
          women 7.5% in 2008), truckers (3.3% in 2004), and miners (2.4% in 2004);8
          and
         also gave the impression that the epidemic was stable, or even in decline,
          despite the conflicts experienced by DRC from 1996 to 2003.

149. The National Strategic Plan to Combat AIDS was adopted in July 2009 by
CNMLS (the decision-making and guiding entity of PNMLS) and serves as a reference
point for all interventions against HIV/AIDS for the period 2010-2014. Besides the
general population, NSP focuses on at-risk groups: (i) sex workers; (ii) female victims of
sexual violence; (iii) internally displaced persons; (iv) workers in mobile jobs (truckers,
miners, soldiers, and others); and (v) injection drug users (IDUs).

150. The restructuring of the project was not, however, based on epidemiological data,
nor did it fundamentally modify the indicators or propose new changes in the 2007
restructuring.

151. In conclusion, from 2004 to 2010, the project context evolved on many levels
(institutional, technical, financial, and monitoring, among others), but the project
remained more or less fixed on its original approach. This approach was relevant at the
beginning, but it would have been better to include more positive responses to the

Program to Combat HIV/AIDS in DRC, 2009-2012.

  The 2007 Demographic and Health Survey (EDS) estimated the prevalence in the general population at 1.3% (1.6%
for women and 0.9% for men), and UNAIDS (2008) validated the EDS data, situating national seroprevalence in a
range between 1.2% and 1.5%. However, DRC has contested the methodology and results of the EDS and has
continued to use the prevalence rate of 4.5%.

  The situational analysis notes that there might be other vulnerable groups in the country, identified as such on the
basis of fragmentary studies or anecdotal data concerning their behavior. Unfortunately, in the absence of
supplementary data, it is impossible to resolve this issue. Op. cit., p. 6.

modifications suggested by the various missions (such as the minimum package,
institutional audit, and organization of ARV drugs).

1.2 Effectiveness in meeting the project development objectives

152. With regard to progress made on the performance indicators and disbursement
rates during the different project implementation periods, the project was rated
Substantial, for the initial project, Low after the 2007 restructuring, Substantial after the
2010 restructuring, and modest for the project as a whole.

153. PDO 1: To make STI and HIV/AIDS treatment more accessible. The
indicators contributing to PDO 1 deal with access to services and performance of services.
For the reasons given above, prevention indicators are covered by this PDO.

1.3 Efficiency in achieving the project development objectives (PDO)

154. In view of the overall expenditures and results and the measures adopted during
the project to improve its efficiency, performance was rated Modest for the initial project,
Negligible after the 2007 restructuring, Modest after the 2010 restructuring, and modest
for the project as a whole.

155. General considerations. The PAD had based the efficiency criteria for the project
on: (i) the economic benefits resulting from the reduction in the number of new infections
and the improvement of the economic prospects of persons living with, and affected by,
the HIV epidemic; and (ii) the prompt implementation of the project so as to reap its
benefits as soon as possible. Actually, given the generalized nature of the epidemic, the
lack of infrastructure and human resources, and the huge size of the still unstable country,
the original efficiency criteria have proved to be irrelevant.

156. Moreover, MAPs, by their nature, are inefficient in the early phases because they
are called upon to (i) adapt the components (and budget allocations) and institutional
arrangements to the national context; (ii) implement a high-performance planning and
budgeting system that allows for the adoption of annual action plans to submit for non-
objection to the Bank as soon as possible; and (iii) quickly build management capacities
at the central and provincial levels. In the face of these constraints, PNMLS was able to
disburse only 22% of the grant amount in the first two years, half of which was spent on
management and capacity-building.

157. Lastly, since 2007, the Government made the commitment, through the PRGSP
and the Priority Action Plan (PAP), to fight poverty and apply a realistic wage policy;
and all the development partners agreed to provide support for staff incentives such as
bonuses or honorariums as part of their interventions.

158. Specific measures. The project had taken certain steps to improve the efficiency
of interventions under PDO 1, including the use of MOD (especially at the beginning and
end of the project) for a significant proportion of prevention and treatment interventions:



                                              43
             UNHCR and Constellation for community awareness-raising;
             ASF for condom distribution;
             FOMETRO, Centre Victoire, and CCISD for IST;
             CORDAID, CTB, and GTZ for blood transfusion.

159. Unfortunately, the effort to recruit MOD staff for PMCT and VCT to implement
these elements was unsuccessful.

160. As for interventions in relation to PDO 2, the project basically depended on
subsidies to the public, private, and non-governmental sectors and community initiatives.
This support started out timidly, however, and the results have never been adequately
evaluated; technical audits, which among other things examined the situation, were not
conducted annually (as stipulated in the grant agreement) and did not address the
performance of the recipients.9 Even the available data on the distribution of subsidies by
recipient and province have not been analyzed with a view to improving the management
of interventions.

161. As for interventions under PDO 3, the Project had recruited: (i) a fiduciary
management agency and a procurement expert; (ii) technical specialists in the
establishment of norms, planning, and capacity-building; and (iii) internal and external
auditors for financial and institutional audits. The project also conducted a mid-term
review.

162. In addition, DRC participated in an evaluation of the responses to the epidemic10
in 2006, which concluded that, despite the existence of political will at the highest
governmental level and efforts at coordination, the national strategy for harmonizing
HIV/AIDS control interventions has been characterized by (i) poor alignment between
partners with regard to national priorities; (ii) insufficient harmonization of finances; and
(iii) weaknesses in coordination among the various levels of intervention and in the
circulation of strategic information.

1.4 Overall project evaluation and justification

163. On the basis of ratings on criteria, results, and disbursements during the various
phases of the project, the following table presents the final conclusion, which rated the
project moderately unsatisfactory.

3.5 Other topics, results, and impacts

164. Poverty, gender, and social development. The fight against HIV/AIDS and STI
has always been one of the five pillars of the poverty reduction strategy in DRC (PRGSP).

constantly growing every year, the country has found it enormously difficult to take care
of its most vulnerable people. Thus, as shown by various studies, some persons in the
youngest groups, particularly girls, have become prostitutes and exposed themselves to
HIV/AIDS and other STI.11 The promulgation of Act No. 08/011 of July 14, 2011, on the
protection of people living with or affected by HIV/AIDS, which governs the national
HIV/AIDS policy in DRC, represents the State’s effort to deal with the poorest and most
vulnerable groups.

165. Various studies and surveys have revealed the growing feminization of the
epidemic, and the project has funded ministries and NGOs specializing in interventions
for women.

166. The PAD had provided for monitoring of the social impact of the project on
vulnerable groups, but this activity was never carried out.

167. Development/building of institutional capacities. Two elements should be noted
with regard to institutional capacities. On the negative side, the institutional arrangements
currently in place have not yielded the expected results and have, since the beginning of
the project, undermined the impact of PNMLS in DRC. The following do exist,
however: (i) the MAP project, which finances the operations of CNMLS, including its
multisectoral HIV/AIDS/STI activities, and has its secretariat in PNMLS; and (ii) Global
Fund financing, which uses another coordination mechanism at the country level (CCM)
and has its technical secretariat in the Ministry of Health.

168. On the positive side, the project has helped consolidate and strengthen the
capacities of decentralized bodies (in all provinces and in 10 districts) and of hundreds of
NGOs, umbrella groups, and communities.

2. Assessment of risks related to the attainment of development objectives

169. The risk that the results of the project will not be sustainable after it closes is
considered High, because of three types of uncertainties.

170. First, in view of the changes in the focus of the project, the development and
adoption of project-financed strategies are not guaranteed. For example: (i) the financing
of MOD has certainly contributed to the results, but perhaps to the detriment of the
improvement of health services; (ii) the implementation of awareness-raising strategies
has never been consistent with the fairly slow expansion of VCT; and (iii) the distribution
of ARV drugs does not sufficiently take into account the other partners present in the
field, and it risks being technically incomplete.12 The current NSP, and especially the
action plans, could eventually help improve the coherence of the strategies, provided that
adequate leadership and financial resources are available.

171. Second, the setting up of coordinating bodies to carry out initiatives in the
provinces has established the presence of the national program, but the lack of a technical
and financial framework (indicated by the extreme variation in the number of staff) is
endangering the future of these structures and the priority activities they are supposed to
be carrying out. Without a realistic assessment and regular monitoring of the expected
and actual results of these structures, it will be difficult to maintain them.

172. Third, in a country where the financial resources for fighting HIV/AIDS are
provided almost exclusively by external sources, the continued pursuit of the objectives
depends more on the rational alignment of available resources than on the estimate of
overall needs. In attempting to estimate the gap (between available resources and needs)
instead of indicating where to direct the available funds, the Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) prepared by PNMLS has accentuated the problem of the country's
dependency rather than taking into account the facts on which a more effective response
could be based.

3. Evaluation of the performance of the World Bank and the Borrower

3.1 Performance of the World Bank

173. Early quality assurance. The preparatory phase occurred in the context marked
by: (i) generalized poverty in certain areas; (ii) certain behaviors (precocious sexual
relations, multi-partner sex, population mobility, and others); and (iii) a weak response to
the epidemic owing to the prolonged conflict (especially in the East) and the withdrawal
of experts and financial resources. However, instead of analyzing the particular situation
in DRC, the preparatory team adopted and systematically applied the standard MAP
country model.

174. The team analyzed the capacities of the public and private sectors and of NGOs,
but it did not study community-based organizations (CBOs). Moreover, certain critical
elements were not sufficiently taken into account: (i) institutional arrangements at the
central level (including with other partners, especially the Global Fund); (ii) the
decentralization modalities, in particular the definition of the roles and responsibilities of
provincial and district-level bodies; (iii) the difficulties of setting up a monitoring and
evaluation system; and (iv) the problem of human resources (including weak technical
capacities and abysmal wages in DRC).

175. Moreover, the preparatory phase had properly categorized the project risks as high,
but in the details of the PAD and in the table presenting the measures envisaged to
mitigate the risks, the preparation team was too optimistic in its proposed solutions.
Lastly, the project was launched only seven months after its approval.

176. As for the quality of project preparation and implementation, the World Bank
rated the performance moderately unsatisfactory.




                                              46
177. Quality of supervision. During the preparatory phase of the project, difficulties
with regard to supervision were mentioned, in view of the large size of the country, the
complexity of the project, and the lack of implementation capacities for World Bank
projects in DRC. It had been decided to assign Bank staff to Kinshasa and seek other
resources (other partners, trust funds, among others) to build supervisory capacities.
Except for a period in 2008-2009, permanent staff members in Kinshasa oversaw the
project13 and were supported locally by financial management and procurement experts
as well as specialists from Washington D.C. in several areas (planning, monitoring and
evaluation, private sector organization, drugs, and others). Despite these staff, only five
supervisory missions, with aide-mémoire, were carried out during the entire project.

178. As can be seen in the progress reports on the project, ratings for the various
project elements were rated Satisfactory until June 2006, when most of them became
Moderately unsatisfactory or worse (mainly owing to weaknesses in financial
management and procurement), and have remained at that level, more or less (apart from
financial management and procurement), until today.

179. Indeed, the project was classified as a "problem project" for four years, despite a
series of attempts by task team leaders (TTLs) to improve the situation, as well as two
restructurings. Unfortunately, the TTLs all took different approaches (see paras. 25-26),
and the restructurings incorporated points raised in informal project exchanges rather
than any new elements.14 Moreover, the modification of the development objectives and
the formulation of the indicators proposed by the 2007 restructuring subsequently led to
problems.15

180. At the document level, it was noted that the Bank never provided the project with
a French version of the PAD. The four aide-mémoires almost always arrived one or two
months late, and the results of the implementation status reports (ISRs) were not shared
with the project. A technical support team (TST) mission in October 2008 complemented
the analysis of the project’s mid-term review, but its recommendations were not followed.
Communication with the project was often strained, and long periods of time passed
without any significant progress in the dialogue.

181. In terms of the quality of supervision (including the two project restructurings),
the Bank rated the project performance unsatisfactory.

182. Overall evaluation of the Bank's performance and justification. Given the
weaknesses in the preparation of the project and their impact on the implementation
phase, together with the lack of progress in removing the project from the "problem
project" category, the Bank's performance was rated moderately unsatisfactory.

   These personnel dealt with PARSS more than with PNMLS.

   Among other things, it was difficult to separate the indicators by PDO (especially for prevention).

3.2 Borrower's performance

183. Government performance. The Government's commitment was often cited in the
documents, but this commitment is difficult to measure because the Government did not
have to finance a counterpart to the Bank’s financing. However, at the political and
regulatory level, the Government: (i) always supported the fight against HIV/AIDS as a
pillar of the poverty reduction strategy; (ii) adopted the NSP (2010-2014); and (iii)
promulgated the law protecting PLHIV and those affected by HIV/AIDS; and at the
technical level, the Government, through its sectoral ministries, set up units and carried
out activities to combat HIV/AIDS, but the ministries did not set aside funds in their
budgets for implementing these activities. Moreover, the Government did not act in time
to either resolve the institutional problems identified by the various missions or appoint a
national coordinator to replace the interim coordinator, who had been on the job for
nearly four years.

184. As a result of these factors, the Borrower's performance was rated moderately
satisfactory.

185. Performance of the executing agency. The responsibilities for executing the
project were shared between: (i) the National Multisectoral Program to Combat AIDS
(PNMLS), created by Presidential Decree No. 04/029 of March 17, 2004; and (ii) the
fiduciary management agency, which was recruited through an international bidding
process and was assigned responsibility for procurement and financial management.

186. According to the evaluations of the Bank’s ISRs, the performance of PNMLS has
been rated, with a few exceptions, Moderately unsatisfactory since June 2006, even in
view of the progress of the project, in general, and the performance of the components of
the response, in particular.

187. During the project, there were two FMAs: (i) PWC from October 2004 to
September 2008; and KPMG after September 2008. According to the evaluations of the
Bank’s ISRs, the performance of the initial FMA (PWC) was moderately unsatisfactory
as a whole, but with variations depending on the function and the period. The
performance of the procurement function improved in 2007, with the support of an
international procurement expert for two years; the performance of the financial
management task remained moderately unsatisfactory, at best. The performance of the
current FMA (KPMG) has been satisfactory since December 2009.

188. Given the long period of poor performance by PWC, the project results as a whole
are rated moderately unsatisfactory.

189. Overall evaluation of the Borrower's performance and justification. Given the
performance of the Government, PNMLS, and the FMAs, the Borrower's performance
was rated moderately unsatisfactory.




                                             48
4. Lessons learned

190. In the DRC context, greater stress should be laid on project preparations. The
PAD cited the lessons learned from other MAPs, but it did not apply them to the
Congolese context; for example, (i) the institutional arrangements and monitoring and
evaluation modalities reproduced the same mistakes as elsewhere; and (ii) the strengths
of the fight against HIV/AIDS, which could have served as a point of departure for
developing the best response, were replaced by the MAP model. MAPs that do not have
“local color? or “local champions? have very little chance of success.

191. The importance of drawing a distinction between problems requiring firm
management by the Bank and weaknesses that call for modifications in the agreements
should not be ignored. Informal procedures ("freezes" and limited non-objections), the
introduction (or imposition) of new initiatives, and restructurings have clearly been
unable to solve the problems of the project, and more thought should be given to the
reasons for this outcome.
