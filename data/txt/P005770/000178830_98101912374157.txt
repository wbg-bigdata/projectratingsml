I. TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   Effects of Geography and Transport on Economic Growth
1.01      Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) occupies about 195,000 km2 of largely
mountainous country in the southwest corner of the Arabian peninsula. It is
bordered to the north and east by Saudi Arabia, to the south by the People's
Democratic Republic of Yemen, and to the west by the Red Sea. There are three
distinct geographic regions, the rainless coastal plain (known as the Tihama)
along the Red Sea, the central highlands up to about 4,000 meters altitude
where about two-thirds of the population live, and the eastern plateau which
runs out into the desert sands of Saudi Arabia to the east. The highlands,
especially to the south where rainfall is higher, are markedly more fertile
than the eastern plateau. Agriculture is maintained through irrigation and
water conservation systems.
1.02      The mid-1977 population of YAR is estimated at 6.5 million, 1/ about
74% of which is in raral areas and 6% in urban areas; the remaining 20% are
emigrant workers abroad. The 1976 per capita income was about $250 per annum;
economic developent is constrained by the scarcity of natural resources and
technical and administrative skills. Agriculture is the major economic
activity in YAR, accounting for about half of the GDP and employing about 70%
of the work force. Emigrant workers' remittances in 1975/76 covered more than
100% 2/ of the foreign trade balance. Non-agricultural resources are few.
1.03      Twenty years ago there was little transport infrastructure in YAR;
rapid growth in airport, seaport and road infrastructure since then have
helped economic and social development very considerably. There are no rail-
ways in YAR, the main centers of population are in the rugged highlands where
road transport plays an important role. Coastal shipping is minimal; the main
seaport at Hodeidah handles most of the country's imports and exports. Sana'a
Airport caters to most of the international passenger traffic.
B.   The Transport System
1.04      The transport system in YAR include one major international airport,
one major seaport, about 1,100 km of main roads and about 600 km of secondary
roads (IBRD Map 13312).
(a) Highways
1.05      Most of the primary roads connecting the larger urban and rural
populations are paved now, and the remainder are scheduled for completion by
about 1980. The Government's objectives in the highway sector are to expand
the rural and secondary road network, upgrade paved roads with overlays and

Position and Projects of the Yemen Arab Republic".

to maintain the expanding network. These are well justified objectives, but
the main issues are the problems of effective management and a crucial short-
age of manpower, skilled and unskilled. These are national problems, not
peculiar to the highway sector, and their solutions will be slow to achieve.
1.06      Transport operators are primarily in the private sector and they
operate competitively. The Government has decided to impose vehicle loading
regulations since overloading has become significant (para 2.04).
(b) Ports
1.C7      YAR has three ports, Hodeidah, Mocha and Salif.  Hodeidah port is
centrally located and handles 90% of the country's general cargo-traffic and
all oil imports; Mocha has a small lighterage port well located to serve the
prosperous southern highlands Governorate of Taiz, and Salif port is a deep
water natural harbor with a modern salt loading pier, but has no general cargo
facilities and is farther away from major traffic centers in the country com-
pared to the other two. The first two ports are managed by the Yemen Ports
Marine Affairs Corporation and the last by the Yemen Salt Export Corporation.
Port facilities and management are inadequate. A port project has been
appraised by the Bank and an IDA credit was signed in May 1977.
(c) Civil Aviation
1.08      Airports at Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah service domestic and interna-
tional travel, and airstrips at Saadah, Marib and Berat provide for domestic
ser-vice in the north and east. There are also a number of other rudimentary
strips in the colntry, some of which can handle DC-3s. The airport at Sana'a
has a fairly new and adequate terminal, but is not equipped for night landings.
YAR's airports, by and large, lack adequate navigational and safety equipment.
Yemen Airways, the national air carrier, has a fleet of four DC-3's, three
DC-1's, (not all of which are regularly in operating condition) and one Boeing
737.  In addition, the airline has two medium size, three-engine jets on "wet"
lease (everything, including crew, provided). In 1975 Yemen Airways carried
almost 80,000 passengers of which over 78,000 were on international flights
within the Middle East. Passenger movements at Sana'a Airport increased 60%
in L975 to 240,000 over the previous year. Expansion works at Sana'a and
Hodeidah airports are in progress.
C.   Transport, Policy, Planning and Coordination
(a) Policy and Planning
1.09      The Central Planning Organizations (CPO) is responsible for national
economic planning, and investment decisions have in the past been made largely
on El project basis with the determining factor being the availability of
foreign aid. Generally, these decisions and transport policies have been
based on a rational approach to the more important requirements, and as a
result, all three transport modes have developed considerably during the last
20 years. A Five-Year National Development Plan 1976/77-1980/81 is being
drawn up by the Government. It's most recent review in December 1977 shows a



-3-
proposed expenditure of $3,600 million over the five years, including $1,100
million on transport of which $1,000 million is shown for highways.
(b) Organization and Regulations
1.10      The Ministry of Public Works and Municipalities (MPWM) is respon-
sible for road and marine transport through the Highway Authority (HA), the
Yemen Salt Export Corporation (Salif port) and the Yemen Ports Marine Affairs
Corporation (Hodeidah and Mocha). The Civil Aviation Authority, responsible
for air transport, is attached to the Ministry of Communications. The major
constraint now in the transport sector, as with most sectors in YAR, is the
scnrcity of manpower both for management and operations.
1.11      The Government controls schedules of public transport and road haul-
age routes. These controls are administered so there is competition in road
transport. Following vehicle loading analyses carried out under the Second
Highway Project, the Government intends to impose a 13-ton axle load limit on
all paved roads (para 2.04). This was predicated on a national study which
showed that total road costs (user plus maintenance plus construction) can be
minimized by limiting axle roads to this level; it is also the standard adopted
in neighboring Saudi Arabia from which some of the more heavily loaded vehicles
emanate.
(c) Financing and Investment
1.12      The transport sector is financed mostly from external aid for its
development, with recurrent and operating costs covered from the Government
budget. In the highway subsector, financing of road maintenance only began
in 1972/73 and has risen from $220,000 in that year to $3,330,000 in 1976/77.
Shortages of staff and inadequate institutional arrangements must be overcome
before the HA can absorb major increases in its road maintenance load. The
proposed Project includes appropriate management and training components to
assist in overcoming these problems.
D.   Previous Projects
1.13      IDA has assisted with $16.7 million in financing two previous highway
projects and $6.0 million for a ports project. Work on the highway projects
is satisfcatory and they are due to be completed during 1978 while the ports
project is due to be completed in 1981. The First Highway Project comprised
feasibility studies and engineering, supply of road equipment, construction of
the Taiz-Turba road and technical assistance to the HA. The Second Highway
Project continued the technical assistance and covered the construction of the
Taiz-Km 64 road. The ports project provides technical assistance to the Ports
and Marine Affairs Corporation, and includes civil works and provision of
equipment for the ports of Hodeidah and Mocha.
1.14      The first two highway projects have improved many aspects of highway
operations in YAR despite shortages of staff and a small base upon which they
could build initially. In particular, these two highway projects assisted



-4-
in: (i) separating out road construction from other public works; (ii) im-
proving the management structure for the HA; (iii) building up a road con-
struction ability in the HA; (iv) initiating an equipment hire pool; (v)
initiating road maintenance; and (-i) introducing vehicle loading controls.
II. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A.   The Network
2.01      Until recently, the road network has been but loosely defined, and
this was adequate for initial purposes while the main links were being opened
up and paved. For the 1978/79-1980/81 highway maintenance program, an inven-
tory of roads has been prepared and this shows that at present the classified
road network is 1],077 km of paved roads and 619 of unpaved roads, and will
increase to about: 1,700 km and 1,000 km respectively by 1980. There are also
a large number of unclassified tracks leading into the populous rural areas
and which require varying degrees of improvement before they can be considered
part of the network. It is expected that as the HA's capacity to improve and
maintain roads in,creases, the classified road network will increase in length.
2.02      The main road network is nearly all paved and provides an essential
service in linking the main areas of population, generally through rugged
terrain. These roads have deteriorating riding surfaces partly as a result
of axle overloading (para 2.04) and partly due to lnck of maintenance. There
are few gravel-surfaced engineered roads; most secondary and feeder roads are
only slightly improved tracks.
B.   Traffic
2.03      In 1976 the HA set up a traffic division which initiated traffic
counting on a regular basis with the assistance of the technical assistance
consultants provided under the second IDA credit. Various traffic data
are becoming available now and, initially, these indicate that nearly all
vehicle-kms travelled in YAR are on paved roads, the transport of commodities
is generally unidirectional, and that recent traffic growth rates have been
high. Traffic growth rates for 1977/82 are predicted at 10% per annum for
light vehicles and 6% per annum for truck and bus traffic. By 1976 heavy
vehicles comprised 42% of the total vehicle fleet of 15,000 and the average
annual growth ratie of the fleet over the last four years has been 27%.
2.04      Traffic studies show that there is significant overloading of paved
roads by some vehicles. At present their effect is not serious on most of
the paved roads, but projections, assuming various levels of loading control,
show that an overLay program is needed to strengthen paved roads in YAR
(paras 3.07 and 3.16). The Government has introduced legislation to limit axle
loads to 13 tons as a result of the recommendations 1/ made under the Second
Highway Project by the HA consultants, Kampsax (Denmark).

Strengthening Study".

C.   Administration
2.05      The HA, set up in 1972, is responsible for the design, construction
and maintenance of public roads in rural areas; it is an autonomous Government
organization with its own capital (mainly road equipmant) and controlled by
a Council of ex-officio Government Directors and whose Chairman is also the
Minister of Public Works and Municipalities. It carries out technical plan-
ning, design and road maintenance at cost from the Government budget and
carries out road construction for central Government and local authorities on
a contractual basis. The HA has central services for planning, design, and
administration in Sana'a with regional offices for construction and maintenance
in Taiz, Hodeidah, Ibb, Sada'h and Sana'a. In 1976 the HA set up a Mechanical
Services Division providing equipment on a hire basis for both construction
and maintenance, and in 1977 set up separate Construction and Maintenance
Divisions. Equipment hire rates are adequate to cover depreciation and the
full service cost of the equipment including Division overheads. Prior to
this, all these services had been combined in one Operations Division. During
negotiations, it was confirmed by the Government that the HA will establish
separate accountability and equipment inventories between construction and
maintenance. The new organization of the HA is shown on the chart at page 6.
2.06      There is a very serious shortage of staff at all levels in the HA.
The Government is acutely aware of this situation and intends to alleviate it
by recruiting staff from abroad, and by introducing a training program for
technical staff in the HA. The proposed Project includes a training component
(paras 3.13 and 3.14), and assistance to finance expatriate staff for the HA
(para 3.12).
D.   Planning
2.07      The planning of highway development is the responsibility of the CPO
in consultation with the MPWM. Highway development has been on a project-by-
project basis; in the early years the determining factor was the availability
of foreign aid, but this situation is now changed with increase in aid from
Arab sources. In 1971 Consultants SWECO (Sweden) carried out feasibility
studies financed by the UNDP with the Bank as executing agency. SWECO pro-
posed a program for highway investment on about 1,400 km for the period
1972-79. Although this program was prepared on the basis of limited traffic
data, it provided sufficient information for determining priorities, some of
which were included in the Government's three-year development plan 1973/74
through 1975/76. Other priority roads have been the subject of detailed
engineering studies (para 2.12) as part of the preparatory work for the
five-year development plan 1976/77 through 1980/81.
2.08      The Five-Year Development Plan, announced in June 1977, was reviewed
with international agencies later the same year. Twenty-seven percent of the
expenditure is proposed for highway development. This covers a large selection
of proposed construction on all types of roads in YAR. A priority ranking of
projects within the Plan is required and this is being provided by a highway
master investment plan to be prepared under the proposed Third Highway Proj-
ect (para 3.11). The design of selected priority roads for overlays is
included in the proposed Project (para 3.10). Provisions have been made in

the Plan for setting up a Government/Joint venture construction company with a
private firm (para. 2.16) and for setting up a Government sponsored road
transport company. Highway sector targets in the Plan are very ambitious in
view of the scarcity of manpower and the need to develop adequate control
systems.
E.    Financing
2.09       The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, UNDP, and the Association have financed
most of the feasibility studies and detailed engineering, training, and tech-
nical assistance for the HA. Major highway construction financing has been
assisted with bilateral aid, as shown below:

2.10      The construction of feeder roads has been financed by local authori-
ties and cooperatives with help from the World Food Program (WFP) and the
Association. Construction of feeder roads included under IDA financing are in
the Tihama I and Southern Uplands Development projects. The HA takes on all
its construction work on a contractual basis.
2.11      The Government finances road maintenance, design and related admin-
istration, and the HA carries out this work at cost.
F.   Engineering
2.12      Detailecl engineering for road construction is carried out either by
consultants or directly by an agency of the country financing the construction.
Some of the recommended roads in the 1971 SWECO feasibility studies have been
engineered and constructed.  In 1976 three consulting engineering firms were
employed to carry out detailed design on about 2,300 km of secondary and feeder
roads; these are shown at Table 2 on page 9. Some of these projects are in-
cluded in the 1976/77-1980/81 development plan for construction to gravel and
pavedl standards and some were in the earlier SWECO studies. A program of
detailed engineering for overlays to paved roads has started with the overlay
design for the Taiz-Km64 road (para 3.16), and is scheduled to continue under
the proposed Project.
2.13      In the past, design standards have been determined individually for
each project; in 1976 suitable standards were drawn up by the HA for low
traffic volume roads (up to 400 vpd design volume) and these are being used
for the engineering program now underway. The establishment of design stand-
ards was a covenant of the Second Highway Project that has been satisfactorily
met. Design standards for high traffic volume roads (applicable primarily
to the recently constructed paved main road network which was generally
designed for 8 ton axle loading rather than the new 13 ton standard) are under
preparation. The HA needs staff strengthening to enable it to carry out some
engineering itself and to supervise the work of consultants on engineering
studies; provision is made for this under the technical assistance in the
proposed Project (para 3.12).
G.   Construction
2.14      Construction methods in the early years of road development varied
depending upon the preferred procedures of the financiers. The People's
Republic of China, the USSR and USAID used force account methods with their
own management back up. Latterly, there have been more construction projects
executed by contract, though there have been difficulties in obtaining inter-
nationally competitive bids. Under the First Highway Project, in 1975, the
HA itself contracted to construct the Taiz-Turba road on a force account basis
after difficulties were encountered in obtaining competitive bids. Since
then, four major road contracts have been awarded after competitive bidding
(all to foreign firms). Bid rates reflect a premium is paid to cover the
conditions prevalent in YAR. This premium is not normally included in a con-
tractor's risk elsewhere. Even the HA contract, though priced more reasonably,
has had to be subsidized by the Government. Allowance of 25 percent is made
for this risk in estimating the cost of construction elements in the proposed
project (para 3.21).

2.15      The HA undertakes minor construction and improvements of roads on
a contract basis; it also has the capacity to carry out one major construc-
tion project at a time. At present there are 14 minor construction projects
on about 500 km of road and 6 major projects in progress in YAR, of which the
HA is carrying out all the minor projects and one major one.
2.16      Domestic contractors carry out some minor construction but they have
little experience in road building. The HA policy is to allow a 7.5% bidding
preference for domestic contractors in evaluating all bids. Such contractors
must be in joint venture with foreign firms to qualify for bidding. An IDA
investigation has indicated domestic contractors would have little difficulty
in raising the necessary finance for road construction, but suffer from tech-
nical and management inadequacies. A component has been included in the Sana'a
Second Water Supply and Sewerage project, Credit 670-YAR, for assistance to
the construction industry in YAR.   The HA hopes to set up a joint venture
construction company with a private firm in such a way that it will qualify for
international competitive bidding as a construction company completely separate
from other HA functions. During negotiations the Government confirmed that
it would keep the Association informed on the setting up of such a joint
venture and its subsequent operations.
H.   Maintenance
2.17      The HA views road maintenance as a high priority amongst its various
activities. Road maintenance has improved since 1975 when the Government first
made significant allocations of funds from its annual budgets for this pur-
pose, though staff shortage in the HA hampers effective maintenance and limits
the network included in the maintenance program. Recently, some sections of
paved main road have begun to fail because of underdesign, poor construction
and overloading. Special maintenance arrangements have been made to carry out
urgent repair works and preventative maintenance both by contract and force
account on the Sana'a-Taiz and Sana'a-Hodeidah roads. The Government has
prepared a three-year road maintenance program 1/ with assistance from consul-
tants, Kampsax (Denmark) under the Second Highway Project and, in conjunction
with this, has prepared a special maintenance program for urgent repair works
and a pavement str,engthening program for all main roads. Details of the
maintenance program, which will be implemented under the proposed Third
Highway Project, are in the Project File. Road maintenance will be carried
out under the direction of the new maintenance division of the HA.
I.   Training
2.18      The shortage of qualified personnel at all levels has seriously
hampered the manag,erial and operational performance of the HA. Although
during the recent past it has taken steps to strengthen its personnel manage-
ment and salary policy, the HA has not yet been able to substantially improve
its capability to recruit qualified personnel and retain the existing limited
number of competent staff. So far, training of new recruits has been carried
1/   Source:  Kampsax November 1977 Report on "Three-Year Road Maintenance
Program Study 1978/79-1980/81".



out haphazardly without the benefit of formal courses, experienced instructors
or suitable training equipment.  Under a UNDP/ILO Project, a Vocational Train-
ing Center (VTC) was established in Taiz in 1971, its main responsibility
consisting of maintaining heavy road equipment and, at the same time, carrying
out some on-the-job training of mechanical personnel. In early 1975, the VTC
began to provide formal courses for automotive and heavy equipment mechanics
but by the end of 1977, the Center has trained, retrained and upgraded only
60 mechanics. However, good progress has recently been made by the VTC in
conducting aptitude tests for certain categories of mechanical staff in order
to assess their technical skills, thus enabling the HA to establish a more
effective and uniform personnel classification system, from which a more
realistic set of salary scales has emerged. Similar tests for civil engineer-
ing technicians and administrative personnel have not been carried out due to
lack of experienced staff.
2.19      Currently, the staff of the VTC consists of a director and two in-
structors (automotive and heavy equipment mechanics) who will continue their
assignments under UNDP financing until the end of August 1978, when it is
expected the proposed Project will take over training functions. Because of
the shortage of Arabic-speaking instructors, suitable training equipment and
materials, plus the fact that, in the early stages of its operations, mainte-
nance of equipment took precedence over training, the VTC has had limited
success in meeting the training needs of the HA.
2.20      The need to train new recruits, as well as to retrain and upgrade the
performance of existing staff, will necessitate an expansion and strengthening
of the existing training resources. Funds will be provided for this purpose
under the proposed Project.
2.21      For the training of professional staff the Government has embarked
on a long-term program of sending students abroad for university and other
education to be trained in a wide range of disciplines. In 1977 approximately
3,000 students were abroad under Government sponsorship. This is expected to
continue through the Five-Year Plan with up to 600 Yemeni students per year
studying in medicine, engineering and agriculture. Secondary school education
has been stepped up commensurately. Government-sponsored students are bonded
to work for a period with Government after graduation. It will be some years
before suitable graduates in the engineering field are available to the HA from
this source. The proposed Project will assist in bridging this gap by pro-
viding direct technical assistance to the HA to meet some of their more
critical staffing needs (para 3.12).
III.  THE PROJECT
A.   Objectives
3.01      The project is aimed at helping to overcome the constraints to high-
way development referred to in Section II (see particularly paras 2.02, 2.04,
2.06, 2.08, 2.13, 2.17 and 2.20). To this end the project focuses on institu-
tion building of the HA, highway maintenance and the consolidation and rational



- 12 -
deveLopment of the highway subsector. The project is a follow up to the two
previous highway projects which provided assistance in the setting up of the
HA, in initiating road maintenance and in the construction of two main roads.
3.02      Preparation of the proposed project has been done by the HA with
assistance from their consultants, Kampsax (Denmark), provided under the
Second Highway Project, on the road maintenance, organization, overloading and
road strengthening elements, and with assistance from the UNDP/ILO project
expert on the tra:lning element.

Road Maintenance Program 1978/79-1980/81
3.04      The HA has prepared a three year program for road maintenance 1978/79-
1980/81 covering routine periodic and emergency road maintenance. The program
covers maintenance on a road network which will expand from approximately 1,100
km of paved and 600 km of gravel roads in 1978/79 to 1,600 km and 1,000 km
respectively in 1980/81. The program describes the equipment, staff and funds
needed for the three year period, defines the standards of maintenance to be



- 14 -
adopted (based on an economic evaluation of alternative standards), and speci-
fies the procedures for routine, periodic and emergency road maintenance. To
build up this maintenance capability, the HA intends to deploy some of its
existing road equipment on maintenance. The balance of the equipment required
for maintenance, workshop equipment, the related spare parts, and the pre-
fabricated buildings required for workshops and maintenance depots will be
provided under the proposed project, as capital costs of the road maintenance
program. The HA intends during the period 1978/81 to carry out road main-
tenance by force account. For proper control over road maintenance, the HA
has reorganized its former Operations Division into two divisions with sepa-
rate accountability: one for construction, the other for maintenance. The
Mechanical Services Division of the HA, set up in 1976, provides equipment
on hire to both operating divisions; similarly, the Quarries section of the
Construction DivisiDn will provide road stone on a unit price basis to both
operating divisions.
3.05      Recurrent costs of the program are additional to the capital costs,
and will be provided from the general budget allocations of the Government to
the MPWM for HA road maintenance. The recurrent costs for the three year
program are estimated at US$27.8 million equivalent. A schedule of the road
equipment to be allocated for road maintenance, the equipment to be procured
under the project in general and those under the proposed credit in particular,
were discussed and confirmed with the Government during negotiations. The
roads to be maintained under the program are listed in Table 3; this list was
discussed and confirmed with the Government at negotiations. The Government
confirned at negotiations that it will provide the additional equipment, funds
and personnel to carry out the complete road maintenance program.
Vehicle Loading Controls and Overlays for Paved Roads
(a) Taiz-Km3 Overlay
3.06      The 64 km stretch of the Taiz-Mocha main road leading out of Taiz
towards Hodeidah and Mocha (IBRD Map 13312) was paved to a surface dressing
standard in 1976 under the Second Highway Project. It was designed in 1973
to an 3-ton axle load, reflecting existing and projected traffic at that
time. Since 1973 traffic has doubled on this road and overloading has also
occurred. The riding surface of the first three km of the road (Taiz to the
Turba turnoff) which carries nearly four times the traffic (3,700 vpd) of
the Km3-Km64 section is beginnning to show signs of distress under the
cumulative axle loading.  It is, therefore economical (para 4.08) to overlay
in 1978 the first 3 km section of this road. An average 7 cm thickness of
asphaltic concrete overlay is proposed, comprising a levelling course and a
wearing course. This is expected to last ten years without further overlays
based upon the expected traffic growth and vehicle loading controls. The
geometric design standards of the existing paved road are adequate with two
lanes of 3.5 m widtlh each, shoulders 1.0 m wide each, and a design speed of
80 km/h with satisfactory grades.

(b) Vehicle Weight Control Stations
3.07      In 1976, following a deterioration of existing paved roads in YAR
and following discussions on the subject with the Association, the Govern-
ment initiated an axle loading study and pavement strengthening report. Under
the Second Highway Project, Kampsax (Denmark) carried out this work, submitting
their report in Auagust 1977. There was no axle loading legislation in YAR at
that time. The Government has since defined its policy on vehicle loading to
limit axle loads to 13-tons and control the import of certain heavy vehicles;
road haulers, both local and international, will be able to adjust to the new
regulations without disrupting the economy.  In February 1977, the Government
passed legislation to establish 13-ton maximum axle load regulations.
3.08      Vehicle loading controls will be enforced through axle weighing by
the HA at specific stations on main roads.  The construction and equiping
of five specific vehicle loading control stations are included in this
project. The stations are located on the main roads leading into YAR from
the ports of Hodeidah, Mocha and Aden, and from Saudi Arabia in the north.
Because of local traffic patterns one extra station is proposed between Taiz
and Ibb. During loan negotiations the Government confirmed that it will
implement agreed vehicle load regulations in accordance with a schedule which
includes the construction of control stations.
(c) Supervision of Construction
3.09      Superviision of construction will include short term assignments of
foreign experts for about 25 man-months on the loading control stations, 15
man-months on Taiz-Km 3, and 4 man-months on the buildings.  It is expected
that consultant sitaff supervising nearby major road construction projects
or others already operating in YAR will provide at least some of these services,
if not all.
(d) Detailed Engineering for Overlays on Paved Roads
3.10      About 60 man-months of consulting services are proposed to prepare
detailed engineering for asphaltic concrete overlays on up to 120 km of
priority paved ro,ads. The roads will be selected by the Government after
agreement with thie Association during the proposed Project from assessments
made during the preparation of the Highway Master Investment Plan, and from
the pavement strengthening study report of the HA technical assistance con-
sultants Kampsax (Denmark). During negotiations the terms of reference for
the engineering w,ere discussed with the Government; their details should be
confirmed with the Government when the priority sections have been selected.
Highway Master Investment Plan
3.11      About 50 man-months of consulting services are proposed for the
preparation of a highway master investment plan over a period of about 12
months. It is expected that the investment plan will be carried out early



- 17 -
in the project to determine what road construction might be suitable for
consideration in a possible fourth highway project in YAR. During negoti-
ations the terms of reference for the highway master investment plan were
confirmed with the Government.
Technical Assistance for Key HA Posts
3.12      To assist the HA in some of its most critical staffing needs, espe-
cially on road maintenance and mechanical and accounting services, the project
includes the provision of technical assistance, over three years, through the
HA's employment of foreign experts for various of its senior technical and
professional posts. Twenty posts for a total of 633 man-months are proposed
as shown in Table 4 and these were confirmed with the Government during
negotiations. Two of these posts have already been filled and are being
financed under the Second Highway Project until it closes in 1978. During
negotiations the Government confirmed this technical assistance program and
satisfactory procurement procedures. It was confirmed by the Government at
negotiations that the recruitment of an Equipment Procurement Officer under
this program, and also the recruitment of a Chief Engineer to the HA (or
suitable acting Chief Engineer) would be conditions of effectiveness of the
proposed Credit.
Training Program 1979/81
3.13      In 1977 the HA had approximately 1,000 skilled staff overall (con-
struction, maintenance, planning, design and administration). The skilled
staff requirement for road maintenance is about 300 in 1978/79 rising to
about 600 in 1980/81. The proposed three-year training expansion program
aims at improving the standard of highway maintenance through the training,
retraining and upgrading of a total of 600/700 road and equipment maintenance
personnel including foremen and overseers, equipment operators and drivers,
mechanical maintenance personnel, storekeepers and accountants. The program
also includes courses abroad for several high-level maintenance staff and for
13 technicians to be trained as instructors. The physical resources of the
VTC in Taiz will be expanded by additional facilities, trainees' accommodation,
training equipment and materials ranging from heavy items such as graders,
front-end loaders and bulldozers to workshop tools and machines, and audio-
visual training aids. The training program would include three specialists, a
chief of the proposed training division within the HA Headquarters, a director
of the VTC, and a head of the Training Production Unit (TPU) (para 3.14). In
addition the program would include instructors for the VTC and TPU. It is
also anticipated that some of the technical assistance personnel financed under
the project will also be required to provide training on-the-job for a limited
number of laboratory technicians, bookkeepers/accountants and storekeepers.
This responsibility will be clearly stated in their terms of reference.
3.14      In addition to training programs expected to be conducted in the
VTC at Taiz, practical training will be carried out in the field, in colla-
boration with the operating divisions, through a system of training through
production, requiring the establishment of one TPU for road maintenance. The
trainees working in the TPU would be trained under actual working conditions,
while at the same time, carrying out useful and much needed road maintenance.

The personnel management system of the HA will have a direct bearing on the
ultimate success of any large-scale training plan. The existing personnel
policies, relatively low salary scales, and the difficulties of recruiting
and retaining adequate numbers of suitable personnel at all levels, could
adversely constrain the training effort. The Government is considering pro-
posals made by the Association to improve this situation, such as reclassifi-
cation of salary scales and terms of service.
3.15      The Government prefers to recruit both the senior training special-
ists and instructors individually and directly itself. However, since the
three specialists should operate as a team to plan and control the training
program, and since the instructors must be available when trainees are on
courses, the Association considers that the specialists and instructors should
be recruited through a suitably qualified single entity engaged to carry out
the training. During negotiations, the Government confirmed that they will:
(a) make available sufficient Yemeni personnel for training as instructors;
(b) employ a training entity under terms of reference which were agreed
during negotiations with the Government; (c) ensure that sufficient numbers of
personnel are released from individual divisions for training in both the VTC
and the TPU; (d) monitor the training program with a view to ensuring its
satisfactory operation and extending its activities beyond the three year
period of this project; and (e) provide adequate funds for the operation
of the training program.
C.   Engineering
3.16      Engineering of the Taiz-Km 64 pavement strengthening was carried
out by Consultants Kampsax (Denmark), and financed by the Government. The
overlay of the first three km out of Taiz, which is urgently needed, is
included in the proposed Project. The engineering of the vehicle load control
stations and the preparation of bid documents for the stations will be carried
out separately by the HA with the assistance of Consultants and this arrange-
ment is satisfactory to the Association.
D.   Cost Estimates
3.17      The estimated cost of the project is US$55.3 million including
US$28.5 million of foreign costs. Details are shown at Table 5. During nego-
tiations all the cost estimates were confirmed with the Government and the
Government gave assurances that it would arrange to provide funds to cover the
estimated cost of the project (para 3.24).
3.18      Construction costs for the Taiz-Km 3 overlay are based on detailed
engineering; the foreign costs are estimated from a breakdown of component
cost elements. Construction cost for the vehicle load control stations and
maintenance buildings are based on preliminary engineering. Government taxes,
which are minimal in YAR, have been included in the local costs.
3.19      The cost of equipment for road maintenance, workshops, training,
and for spares to an overall value of 15% of the equipment cost is based upon

estimates using CIF prices and local preparation and delivery costs, but ex-
cluding import duties, since the Government exempts from import duties all
imports to be used on Government projects.
3.20      The cost of technical assistance on training, highway master plan-
ning, engineering, construction supervision and expatriate staff for the
HA have been estimated on the basis of man-months and rates for similar
services in YAR. Average man-month rates for the total costs of these services
are US$8,750 per foreign expert including all local costs and with expected
price excalation (US$5,900 excluding price escalation).
3.21      A 10% physical contingencies allowance is included for all items
except in two cases: one, the Taiz-Km 3 overlay where 7% is used because
the detailed engineering is complete, and because the estimates primarily
involve asphaltic concrete quantities which can be assessed with a relatively
high degree of accuracy; the other case is the loading control stations where
35% is used because only preliminary layouts and quantities are available.
The construction costs of the loading control stations are not significant
cost element in the project. A risk allowance is included for all construc-
tion costs in the project to provide for the uncertainty of bid rates under
the prevailing circumstances in YAR. The risk allowance provided is 25%;
this is based on the premiums paid on four recent major road contracts let
in YAR when compared with engineer's estimates.
3.22      Price escalation on foreign costs has been estimated at 7% per
annum. The appraisal mission estimated escalation on local costs at 3% per
month compounded, and the Government concurred with this figure.
E.   Financing
3.23      The proposed credit of US$11.5 million would cover the foreign
costs of the following project elements:
(a) five of the largest road maintenance equipment supply contracts,
representing 100% of C.I.F. costs of these contracts;
(b) detailed engineering by consultants for overlays on priority
road sections to be selected during the proposed Third Highway
Project;
(c) consultancy technical assistance for the preparation of a
highway investment master plan;
(d) technical assistance through direct employment by the HA
of 20 experts to fill key on-line positions;
(e) all equipment for the training center and training produc-
tion unit, representing 100% of the C.I.F. costs of these
elements; and



- 22 -
(f) technical assistance through the services of an entity/
agency ito administer the training program and provide
instrucitors.
3.24      It is expected that co-financing will cover other foreign and
local costs of th,e project and that the Government will finance the remaining
US$5 million local costs, and will also allocate US$27.8 million from its
general budget allocations to MPWM to cover the recurrent costs of the three
year road maintenance program. Co-financiers are being approached by the
Government. Details of the proposed financing arrangements indicating the
IDA, and recommended Government and co-financing contributions are shown in
Table 5. At negoitiations the Association discussed proposals from the Govern-
ment on the overa'll financing plan and the Government confirmed a co-financing
agreement would be signed between the Government and a co-financier for the
financing of specific project elements totalling US$11 million, before the IDA
credit becomes effective.
F.   Implementation
(a) Responsibility for Project Implementation
3.25      The HA will be responsible for implementing the project.  The HA
will be assisted in their work by consultants on supervision of construction,
training, engineering and master planning.
(b) Project Implementation Schedule
3.26      The imp'Lementation schedule for the major activities of each project
element is shown at Table 6. During negotiations the Government confirmed the
impl,ementation schedule.
3.27      The road maintenance and training programs are for three years com-
mencing during fiscal year 1978/79. Delays are expected on delivery of
equipment in view of likely congestion at the port of Hodeidah. Consultancy
services on master planning are scheduled to be carried out during 1979, and
technical assistance to fill key positions in the HA will be for three years
from mid-1978 (the date when technical assistance under the Second Highway
Project is due to end).
3.28      The Government confirmed during negotiations that HA will present
regu'Lar progress reports to the Association (bimonthly) for the project as a
whole, and will prepare a project completion report.
(c) Procurement of Construction Elements of the Project (non-IDA
elements)
3.29      Construction of the overlay on the Taiz-Km 3 road, maintenance
building and the vehicle loading control stations will be by contract.  Road
consitruction and maintenance in YAR is generally capital intensive; there is a
greait scarcity of labor due to emigration of workers to neighboring countries
and local wages are high.  (Labor costs presently are running about YRls 40 or
US$9 per day.) Labor intensive methods of construction and maintenance were
therefore excluded.

of the project would be used to further the objectives of the project as may
be agreed between the Government and the Association. During negotiations,
the Association discussed and confirmed with the Government the disbursement
schedule.
H.   Environmental Aspects
3.34      Improved maintenance of roads will integrate communities in YAR and
provide better communications. The enforcement of vehicle loading regulations
would increase safety for vehicles and pedestrians using the roads.



- 26 -
I.   Project Risk
3.35      As with most "institution building" projects the risk of not achiev-
ing complete success is high, but even a moderate success would be worthwhile
in the context of the YAR situation. The adverse circumstances YAR suffers
from are: (i) a shortage of qualified staff; (ii) a small organizational base
and little experience in management from which to operate; and (iii) a high
inflation rate.  Ihese circumstances have existed to varying extents through
previous IDA lending to YAR, and despite them the two previous projects have
assisted the HA to grow considerably in competence since it was founded in
1972.
3.36      More specifically, there is a risk that the HA will not be able to
recruit and retain. its on-line technical assistance foreign experts. None-
thele!ss, since the services needed now are executive rather than advisory,
it will be more effective if the HA recruits its own experts.
3.37      There is a risk that,-through loss of manpower to the private sector
and aLbroad, the training program may not initially provide all the trained
staff required (in,cluding instructors). In the longer term trained staff are
likely to return from abroad.
3.38      The management and technical "know-how" of the HA is very thin, but
the willingness of the Government and the HA to rationalize the organization
of the HA and to develop the road maintenance and training divisions, shows
this is a key moment in moving towards an expansion in the HA's activities.
It is for these reasons that the staff believe the risk in this project is
justi.fiable. Project supervision by both the Government and the Association
will be more than usually arduous because, for its success, it will be
dependent upon the! efforts of so many independent people and groups.
IV. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01      The proposed Taiz-Km 3 overlay would protect an important section
of the main road aLccess of Taiz, the second city in the YAR, to Mocha and the
hinterland to the west, from the severe structural deterioration which would
occur' due to significantly higher levels of traffic and axle loading than
were anticipated when the road was originally designed. Such deterioration,
which could only be partially offset by a maintenance effort far in excess of
normal routine maintenance and one that would be, in total, more costly than
the proposed overlay and normal maintenance, would result in significant in-
creasies in the operating costs for vehicles using this roadway link.



- 27 -
4.02      The proposed road maintenance program would protect the national
investment in transport infrastructure and, in conjunction with the project
training component, improve Yemeni highway maintenance capabilities to match
the increasing demands of growing traffic on an expanding highway network.
Economic benefits from improved maintenance would include savings in trans-
port costs since, if the present maintenance effort was unaltered, traffic
serviceability of many highways would deteriorate.
4.03      The training component is a crucial project element since YAR
suffers from a critical shortage of skilled manpower, a shortage that is
greatly exacerbated by the labor drain to the YAR's neighboring oil producing
countries. An intensive, and continuing practical training program in con-
junction with the maintenance program is therefore essential.
4.04      The critical shortage of qualified staff which is endemic to YAR
is deeply felt by the HA. The general objective of the technical assistance
is to supplement for a period of time the HA staff by placing qualified expa-
triate (or Yemeni's now working abroad) in certain key positions where they
can assist in the day to day operations of the HA. Without such assistance
the already overburdened HA might well cease, for all practical purposes,
functioning in a number of areas one of which certainly would be in the
development of an effective maintenance program.
4.05      The development of a master plan for highways will initiate in-
tegrated national highway planning in the YAR, providing an economically
rational framework for future highway investments.
4.06      YAR has only recently studied the implications of axle load limits
as part of the technical assistance program financed under the Second Highway
Project. As a result of such a study the Government is moving to formally
adopt a 13-ton axle load limit. However, once adopted, the limit must be
enforced. For this purpose the project includes provision for the construc-
tion of loading control stations. And, since much of the road network has
been designed and built for significantly lower axle load limits (and, through
overloading, subjected to higher than even the 13-ton load limits) a number of
road links are showing signs of distress. Consequently, provision has been
made for the preparation of detailed engineering for the overlay of some
high priority roads. This engineering will be carried out under the proposed
project.
4.07      The benefits from the investments proposed under this credit will
accrue to the economy of the YAR as a whole. In terms of the transport system
they are sound economic investments responsive to demands for transport which
the system will have to meet. The benefits will accrue directly both to the
state by protecting the national investment in transport infrastructure and
to individual highway users who would enjoy the economic benefits from im-
proved maintenance in terms of savings in transport costs. Beneficiaries
include both the trucking industry and the whole spectrum of income groups
which use the highways for passenger transport. The extent to which benefits



- 28 -
to truckers are passed down to consumers will depend on competition within
the road transport industry; the industry is now freely competitive (para.
1. 11) .
B. Economic Evaluation
(a) :raiz-Km 3 Overlay
4.08      The inputs for the economic evaluation, economic costs and economic
benefits, were developed on the basis of present and projected traffic on the
Taiz-Km 3 section of highway. Traffic projections were based on the present
and expected economic activity of the project area, including import distribu-
tion, projections of future transport demand, development of the vehicle fleet
and truck size composition. However, projections of future traffic were not
critical to the analysis since the calculated First Year Benefit (FYB), which
is basically depenident on present conditions (traffic levels), was over 20%.
Economic costs were measured on the basis of a comparison of the maintenance
and reconstruction costs which would be required to maintain the present
Double Surface Treated (DST) roadway at an acceptable level of service versus
the cost of an overlay and subsequent maintenance costs to keep the roadway
at an acceptable level of service. The two conditions, although both are
"acceptable" are not the same; "acceptable" represents essentially least
cost (user and routine and periodic maintenance), and given the different
structural characteristics of the two alternatives being considered, these
least cost solutions are not equivalent. Nevertheless, this is the proper
comparison to make, the least cost program under one alternative vis-a-vis
the least cost program of the other alternative.l/ This presents no problem
in the analysis, since, on the benefit side, account was taken not only of
difference in maintenance costs 2/ and salvage value but of differences in
user costs, which in fact was the largest benefit. The period of analysis
was ten years and the two alternatives were equated by considering a residual
(salvage) value of 30% for the overlay surface. For purposes of the analysis
an Opportunity Cost of Capital (OCC) of 13% was used. This compares with com-
mercial rates for truck dealers in the YAR of about 12% to 14%, a (fluctuating)
rate of about 12% for commercial advances and one of about 14% for mortgages
and bank personal loans. A summary of the economic analysis figures is at
Table 9.
1/   There are a series of possible levels of maintenance which can be
applied both "with" an overlay and "without" an overlay. But the
significant levels of maintenance for purposes of analysis, both for
the "with" (overlay) and the "without" (overlay) case are obviously the
least (total) cost alternatives. These least cost alternatives do not
have the same level (effort) of maintenance for the "with" and "without"
cases.
2/   Actually differences in the costs of routine maintenace, which were
relatively insignificant, were treated in the cost stream; differences
in periodic maintenance in the benefit stream.

(b) Road Maintenance Program
4.09      The benefits from routine maintenance arise from vehicle operating
cost (VOC) savings as well as extending the time in which investments in
periodic maintenance need to be made. The economic justification for some
level of routine maintenance is apparent. Costs of preventing road failure
through maintenance are less than intermittent reconstruction of the road.
Hence, if the original construction is economically justified, it is econo-
mically justified to maintain the road. Indeed, even if a particular road
improvement was not originally economically justified it usually is justified
to maintain the road since the original investment is a sunk cost and the mar-
ginal costs of maintenance are relatively low. The basic question, therefore,
generally is not whether a road link should be maintained but rather, what
the level of maintenance effort should be. In the economic sense the optimal
level of maintenance will depend on the relationship between the marginal
costs of increasing the maintenance effort beyond that which would just pre-
vent ithe road from becoming impassable and the decrease in VOC and periodic
maintenance costs. The optimal level of maintenance would be that level
which minimizes total cost; the least cost solution in terms of user costs
plus routine maintenance cost plus periodic maintenance costs. This can also
be measured in terms of maximum Net Present Value (NPV), i.e. the optimal
program being the effort that gives the greatest NPV.
4.10      In theory, this optimal maintenance level will vary between differ-
ent road sections, depending on the various incremental maintenance costs and
corresponding road user costs and each road section could be subject to a
separate economic analysis. As a practical matter, however, the number of
actuaL alternatives is limited by the physical and administrative requirements
of the maintenance program as a whole and it is these discrete (possible)
levels of maintenance which should be subject to analysis. In the development
of the three-year Maintenance Program (1978-1981) for the YAR three different
possible maintenance levels, in addition to the existing maintenance effort,
were f'ormulated. One, a program calling for great increases in the maintenance
effort:, was found to be beyond the reasonable administrative physical capacity
of the HA in the period under consideration and was not included in the eco-
nomic evaluation. The other two levels of maintenance effort were quantified
for comparison with the present level of maintenance.
4.11      In developing the user cost analysis for the three levels of main-
tenance analyzed (present and two alternatives) the total vehicle operating
costs on all links of the network in relationship to the three levels was used
to obt:ain the NPV for each maintenance level. Costs were calculated in detail
for 6 representative types of commercial vehicles and for passenger cars.  All
operat:ing costs were based on 1977 prices and 1977 traffic volumes. Traffic
growth rates were based on projected national growth, since such rates are
ordinarily not critical to the analysis.  The estimated OCC of 13% was used
as the discount rate.
4.12      The three levels of maintenance evaluated included the present level
of maintenance effort, which was considered, generally, to result in a "poor"
condition of road surface, a level (Level I) which would keep the road surface



- 31 -
condition in "less than fair" (but better than "poor") condition and a level
(Level II) which would generally keep the road surfaces in a "fair" condition.
Of the three levels, the highest level had the highest NPV, the result of
substantial savings in operating costs which more than offset the higher
maintenance costs 1/ and was recommended.
4.13      On the basis of savings in highway user costs for the network as a
whole a B:C ratio was calculated. This measure is more generally appropriate
than an Economic Return (ER) in the analysis of projects where operating funds
are high in relation to capital costs, such as road maintenance investments.
The B:C ratio for the network as a whole is 4.0:1.0, and was obtained using an
OCC of 13%. A B:C ratio of 3.9 was obtained using a OCC of 20%, and one of
2.6:1.0; when annual maintenance costs were increased by 20%, annual user cost
savings decreased by 20% and an OCC of 20% assumed. Details of the economic
analysis figures are at Table 10. 2/
1/   Generally, the factors critical to the selection of the "optimal"
maintenance program are the OCC and VOC.
2/   Net Present Value for each of the assumptions may be obtained directly
from Table 10 by subtraction of the present wrth of costs from the
present worth of benefits.

(c) Training
4.14      Standard methods of economic justification cannot be applied real-
istically to the training component of the proposed project as an individual
entity.   Training is, however, a crucial project element and the one which
should make the most significant contribution to the attainment of a competent
maintenance organization in YAR. Consequently, it may be considered a part
of the cost of the maintenance program as a whole. Even on such a conserva-
tive basis the benefit cost ratio for maintenance and training is 2.0:1.0.
(d) Technical Assistance
4.15      The costs of technical assistance directly associated with the
administration of the maintenance program are included in the overall economic
costs of the projected maintenance program, which is eminently justified.
This includes the four positions to be filled in the Maintenance Division
(para. 3.12). It also includes the major part of the costs of the Equipment
Procurement Officer, some of the cost of the Deputy Chief Engineer, a signi-
ficant portion of the cost of the six positions to be filled in the Mechanical
Services Division and some of the costs of the five positions in the Admin-
istration/Accounting Division.
4.16      The rest of the costs, while not directly assignable to precise
project elements, are critical to the effective functioning of the HA, which,
in turn, is fundamental to the successful operation of a national road main-
tenance program in YAR.
(e) Master Plan
4.17      It has only been two decades since the first links of a modern
highway infrastructure was constructed in the YAR. From that point in time
up to now, highway planning has been on an ad hoc basis, project by project,
and largely predicated on the availability of foreign aid. Initially, the
investments undoubtedly represented projects of high priority. But, while
coordinated highway planning may not have been critical initially when the
complete lack of modern transport infrastructure made high priority projects
relatively easy to identify, this is no longer the case. Therefore, the
project has included provision for the development of a highway master plan
by outside consultants for, although the HA has a central planning section,
it is not adequately staffed to perform such a study.
4.18      Although a standard measure of economic justification cannot be
applied to this aspect of the project, the development of a highway master
plan, and its implementation, is essential to prevent a misallocation of
resources in highway investment.
(f) Overlay Study and Loading Control Stations
4.19      These two items, like the master plan study, are investments which
cannot be directly evaluated in terms of economic justification. The overlay
studies, because they are part of the costs of projects which have not yet



- 34 -
been analyzed, the loading control stations because they are an integral part
of a larger cost, user plus construction plus maintenance plus control, which
was found to be the least cost solution to the question of whether there
should be axle loading limits imposed in the YAR and, if so, what should
they be. The least cost solution called for a 13-ton limit and the cost of
the control stations is part of that least cost solution. This, then, is
prima facie evidence of their economic justification.
(g)  Overall Economic Justification
4.20      The three elements of the project which have been directly justified
(i.e., the maintenance, training and overlay construction components) represent
86% of the projected project costs. These project elements show an overall
Benefit:Cost ratio of over 1.9:1.0, an Economic Return of over 100% and a Net
Present Value of over US$9.5 million.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During credit negotiations, agreement was reached on various issues
referred to in the report, including the following matters of particular
significance:
(i) the functional separation of construction and maintenance
activities of the HA (para. 2.05);
(ii)  adequate maintenance of the road network classified under
the 1978/79-1980/81 road maintenance program in accordance
with sound engineering and financial practices, and provi-
sion of funds, facilities, services and other resources
required therefore promptly as needed subject to the overall
needs of transport operation in YAR (para. 3.04);
(iii) the dimensions and axle loads of vehicles which shall not
exceed limits consistent with the structural and geometric
design standards of highways, and that within three years
from signing the credit the Government will set up a system
for implementing vehicle load regulations (para. 3.08);
(iv)  employment by the HA of qualified consultants on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Association for master planning
and engineering and a responsible entity (consultant or agency)
for training (paras. 3.10, 3.11 and 3.15);
(v) employment by the HA of on-line expert staff with job
descriptions, qualifications and on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association (para. 3.12);
(vi)  implementation and monitoring of the training program by the
HA and ensuring that all funds, facilities, services and other
resources required therefore are made available (para. 3.15).



- 35 -
5.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the credit are:
(i)  the recruitment of an Equipment Procurement Officer and
a Chief Engineer or suitable Acting Chief Engineer
(para. 3.12); and
(ii)  signature of a loan(s)/agreement(s) between the Government
and other external financiers for an amount of US$11 million
(para. 3.24).
5.03      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$11.5 million to the
Government of YAR on the usual terms.

APPRAISAL OF A
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
Methodology Used for Economic Evaluation
of Routine Maintenance Program
1.        The economic justification for some level of routine maintenance
is apparent. Costs of preventing, through maintenance, the failure of a
roadway are less than the periodic rebuilding (or the original building)
of the roadway. Thus, if the original construction, or the reconstruction,
of the roadway is economically justified it is economically justified to
maintain the road. (Indeed, a proper economic analysis for road investment
will include mainteaance as one element for the cost stream.) Even if a
particular road improvement was not economically justified in the first
place it usually is economically justified to maintain the road since the
original investment has to be considered as a sunk cost, and the marginal
costs of maintenance are relatively low. Indeed, since a substantial part
of road maintenance costs are directly related to the traffic on the roadway,
being low when traffic is low, it is only at minimal levels of traffic
that maintenance may not be economically justified (and the road should be
effectively abandoned).
2.        Nevertheless, there are various levels of maintenance which are
physically and administratively possible, and an economic analysis serves
to establish the reasonableness and to verify the size and scope of the
maintenance program. The optimal level of maintenance should depend on
the marginal costs of increasing maintenance effort (beyond that which
would just prevent the roadway from complete failure or impassability) vis-
a-vis the decrease in user costs. In the theoretical sense this will vary
between various road sections, depending on the various incremental costs and
benefits and each road section could be subject to an economic analysis (of
the maintenance effort). As a practical matter, however, the physical and
administrative requirements of a maintenance program (as well as the fact that
roads do not necessarily all deteriorate according to a theoretical schedule,
and that such "fine timing" is really not justified by the actual empirical
data, especially data on user costs) means that certain discrete levels of
maintenance are planned and then applied with flexibility in the field. Thus,
for purposes of the analysis the links may be grouped by road surface type,
condition, average daily traffic (ADT) and traffic mix into a limited number
of categories. Unless there are expected to be significant differences
in traffic growth rates it is ordinarily not necessary to take this into
consideration in grouping the links (though it is necessary to consider
traffic growth in the analysis). However, for this study it was found



- 42 -                         ANNEX III
possible, given the relatively simple road network in the YAR, to make
the analysis on a link by link basis. For this purpose some 85% of the
total network undler maintenance was evaluated, with only those links which
are scheduled to be improved within the three-year evaluation period excluded.
The network subject to economic evaluation is, therefore, representative of
the total network.
3.        Once the network to be analyzed has been established, and the
method of analysis (grouping, or as in this case, by link) has been estab-
lished, an analysis of the optimal level of maintenance is made. Although the
theoretical possibilities that could be investigated are vast, in actuality
only a limited number of levels of maintenance need be considered - those that
are realistic within the framework of physical and administrative realities.
For the purposes of this study three additional levels of maintenance (addi-
tional to the existing level) were formulated, each of which was at a higher
level (more intensive) than the existing maintenance effort. However, after
evaluation of the inputs required for the highest level proposed (but not the
highest level possible since this level would only have resulted in keeping
road surfaces in a "better than fair" condition) it was found that the organi-
zation and staffing requirements would not realistically be within the H.A.'s
capacity at this time. Consequently, this level was dropped from the economic
analysis.
4.        The optimal (of realistically possible) maintenance level will
be that level which engenders the least total economic cost - user plus
routi.ne plus periodic maintenance.  This may be measured directly or evaluated
in terms of Net Present Value (NPV) against a particular level of maintenance,
ordirnarily the existing level, using the estimated Opportunity Cost of Capital
(OCC). The largest (positive) NPV will represent the most desirable (optimal)
alternative. For this analysis the two alternative levels of maintenance were
measured against the present level of maintenance on the basis of NPV and the
one with the higher NPV chosen as the recommended alternative 1/.
5.        The time framework used in the evaluation was limited to three years.
Periodic maintenance cost were annualized for the purposes of the analysis.
6.        The stream of costs of the actual routine maintenance and the
analyzed periodic maintenance developed for the three-year period for both
the existing maintenance effort and the recommended effort were used to
1/   Since this was the higher of the two alternatives considered, and because
it would requ:ire increased budgetary support as well as additional tech-
nical and manpower inputs the consultant recommend that if unforeseen
constraints should occur and the program had to be down scaled to the
second maintenance alternative the down scaling of effort should first
be made on unpaved roads, where the benefit differential is less, rather
than equally on all roads.

calculate net costs (recommended less existing) and this was expressed in
terms of present worth by the use of appropriate present worth factors. User
costs, representing the cost engendered by the various vehicle types traveling
over each link, were developed on the basis of projected surface conditions
under the present and recommended maintenance effort and.net user costs (or
benefits) obtained by subtraction. When these values were also expressed in
terms of their present worth, using the same present worth factors used for
costs, costs and benefits could be compared in terms of a Benefit:Cost (B:C)
ratio.
7.        Since the factors critical to the selection of the optimal level of
maintenance as well as the calculation of an overall B:C ratio are the OCC and
vehicle operating costs, with routine and periodic maintenance less critical
(and traffic growth generally not critical) a sensitivity analysis was made,
first by using a 20 percent OCC, and then by increasing cost 20 percent and
lowering benefits 20 percent, with a 20 percent OCC. Since the differences
in NPV of the alternatives was substantial and the stream of cost savings
generally directionally equivalent, a change in the OCC did not effect the
ranking of the alternatives. Also, since the B:C was substantial (4.0:1.0 for
the base case) even under the most adverse circumstances considered (benefits
down 20 percent, costs up 20 percent and OCC of 20 percent) the ratio remained
high (2.6:1.0).
