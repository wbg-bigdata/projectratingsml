APPRAISAL OF A FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The State Railway of Thailand (SRT) operates over a 3,830 route-km
meter gauge system which radiates from Bangkok. The principal lines are to
Chiengmai in the North (750 km) and to the Malaysian border (1100 kms) in
the South. Less important lines extend to the Northeast and East to the borders
of Laos and Khmer Republic.
ii.       The SRT has exploited with success its inherent advantages for
long distance bulk traffic but is still saddled uwith the burden of providing
passenger and freight services in areas offering very light volumes of traffic.
In making plans to complete its dieselization program, it is essential for
SRT to review and reschedule certain services now provided by steam traction
in order to avoid the introduction of expensive locomotives on operations
which would not permit an economic utilization of the new equipment.
iii.      During the 1960's the number of road motor vehicles in Thailand
has increased threefold while the highway network has grown at the rate of
about 700 km a year. This has resulted 'n the railways shedding some local
traffic better suited to road transport. in the same period rail passenger
and freight traffic has grown respectively by 6% and 7% annually. Government
transport investments in the last decade have resDonded to the needs of the
growing economy and have helped to stimulate economic development. The
Government's Third Five Year Development Plan (1972-1976) proposes transport
investments amounting to about 20% of total development expenditures. High-
way investments comprise about 80% of total transport investments. in the
Third Plan the emphasis is on the improvement of provincial roads rather than
national highways.
iv.       While the primary transport system was being developed, planning
was simple. Now that most of the obvious needs have been met, more careful
planning will be required for evaluating projects and setting priorities.
A Bank mission comprehensively reviewed the transport sector in October 1971
and identified the need for improved transport planning and coordination.
To this end, the Government has decided to establish a new transport planning
unit, and technical assistance for setting it up has been included in the
Fifth Highway Project.
v.        The SRT was established as a separate legal entity in 1951.  A
Board of Commissioners, appointed by the Council of Ministers, is entrusted
with the formulation of railway policy. The General Manager, a member of
the Board, is in charge of operations. General supervision of SRT is vested
in the Minister of Communications.



vi.        The investment program of SRT for the remaining four vears of the
Third Plan involves total expenditure of Baht 2,251 million (US$108 million
equivalent). The proposed project, covering a first nhase of the program, is
estimated to cost Baht 1,446 million (US$69 million equivalent) including
foreign exchange of USS47 million. The first stage of the program makes
provision for the acquisition of 54 diesel locomotives, 150 passenger coaches,.
470 freight cars and the completion of works associated with the dieselization
program. The proposed loan, US$15.0 million, would contribute part of the
foreign exchange costs of the project.
vii.       Before making final decisions on the implementation of the second
and final stage of the investment program, which will involve the complete
abandonment of steam traction, it is essential for SRT to prepare a compre-
hensive plan covering all aspects of the dieselization program. Provision
is made in the present project for technical assistance in the preparation of
a Plan and for the Covernment to review the Plan with the object of authorizing
necessarv changes in SRT's operations and services in order to maintain a
financially viable situation.
viii.      In the past, SRT has aluways earned a net surplus on revenue account.
It has been able to generate substantial cash balances because its debt
service pavments have been relatively low and no interest has been payable
on Government capital although a payment is made in lieu of income tax.
Earnings have been sufficient for its financial needs. The proposed invest-
ments during the four year program will be financed bv loans (about 57% of
total investment) and from SRT's own substantial cash resources. Financial
forecasts indicate a decline in future profitability aend this, coupled with
a substantial increase in long-term debt, would result in a tendency for SRT
to become too dependent on the Government for cash resources to meet its
normal capital replacements. Agreement has, therefore, been reached on an
earnings covenant providing for a return on net fixed assets of 2' and on a
limitation of future long-term debt, wqhich will mean debt service payments are
to be covered 1.5 times. Implementation of the covenant requirements will
mean the eatly adjustment of certain low tariffs and other selective tariff
increases. These measures, coupled with other proposals bv SRT relating
to improved operational efficiency, would enable it to maintain a satisfac-
tory financial Dosition and permit the generation of adequate funds towards
STZT's capital investment program.
iN.       The emphasis of the Project is on reduction of operating costs
'-oug  continued dieselization, replacement of old equipment and modernization
of workshons; the project investments will also produce increased traffic
carrying capacity.  Taken as a whole, the project yields an economic return
of about 13%.
.N.       The proposed Project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of USSS15.0 million to the State Railway of Thailand (SRT), with a guarantee
from the Kingdom of Thailand, for a 20 year term including 4 vears of grace.

APPRAISAL OF A FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Thailand has asked the Bank to assist in
financing part of the In'estment Program (FY 1972-1976) of the State Railway
of Thailand (SRT). Totaa investment of SRT during the remaining four years
of the program is presently estimated at Baht 2,251 million (US$108 million
equivalent) including foreign exchange of US$73 million equivalent. The
amount of the proposed lan is US$15.0 million equivalent. The Borrower
would be the State Railway of Thailand.
1.02      The Railway's Program, which was revised following discussions with
the appraisal mission, includes procurement of 109 diesel locomotives, coaches,
freight cars and other equipment as well as replacement of rails and bridge
strengthening and replacement works. The proposed loan would contribute to
the first phase of the Program and SRT will be asked to review its further
plans and existing services in order to ensure that in achieving full
dieselization, they also achieve optimum utilization of the new equipment.
1.03      The Bank has made three previius loans to SRT totalling US$37
million mainly for the post-war rehabilitation of the Makkasan workshop
(First), telecommunications equipment and 30 diesel locomotives (Second),
and 60 diesel locomotives and 1,650 freight cars (Third). These operations
have been satisfactorily completed (Annex 1). The most recent loan was
made in 1961 for US$22 million equivalent; the loan was fully disbursed in
October 1967, nearly two years after the original closing date. The delay
was due mainly to cumbersome tender approval procedures.
1.04      Other Bank lending for transportation in Thailand comprises five
Highway loans totalling US$151.6 million equivalent (subsequently reduced
to US$135.3 million) and three Port loans totalling US$20.3 million equivalent.
Details on these loans are given in Annex 1.
1.05      This appraisal is based on the findings of Bank missions in
June and October 1972 comnprising Messrs. Bickers and Rahkonen (economists),
Spencer (financial analyst) and Tachibana (engineer). The report has been
prepared by them.
2. BACKGROUND
A.   Economic Setting
2.01      The economy, which grew rapidly in the 1960's (8% annually),
required a significant growth of transport, but a slowdown set in towards
the end of the decade mainly because world market prices fell for rice and
rubber (the main export commodities) and US military expenditures decreased.



-2-
In 1971 and 1972, unexpectedly large increases in exports, continued growth
in Government expenditures, and a revival in US military expenditures led
to a recovery of investment and output growth, which began slowly around
mid-1972 and will probably gain further momentum in 1973. The Governient's
main objective for the Third Plan (1972-1976) is to sustain a 7% annual
growth rate. Achievement of this objective seems within reach but Thailand
will have to continue to increase its exports rapidly and receive a larger
inflow of external capital. Demand for transnortation will therefore
continue to grow, but probably at a lower rate than during the 1960's, in
line with develonment of the economy. Further details of the economic and
phvsical setting are provided in Annex 2.
B.   The Transport Sector
2.02      Transport requirements in Thailand are much influenced by the size
and importance of Bangkok which, together with its position as the only com-
mercial deeD water port, makes it the natural focal point for all transport
modes. Much of the transport activity outside Bangkok is concentrated within
about 100 km of the capital, but the pographv of the country, with distances
of more than 750 km from Bangkok to the northern border and of over 1,000 km
to the southern border with Malaysia, also requires movements over long
distances (see Map)
2.03      Ranid economic growth has been accompanied by a sharply increasing
demand for land transport. During the 1960's, the number of road motor ve-
hicles (excluding motor cycles) increased more than threefold (Table 1).
At the same time rail passenger-km grew by about 6% per annum, and rail
freight ton-km by about 7% p.a. Within the overall expansion, there has been
a shift in the relative roles of road and rail transnort. With the national
and provincial road network increasing by about 600-700 km in recent years,
and reaching 16,000 km by 1970 (plus some 35,000 km of minor roads), it is
becoming progressively easier for the railway to shed the local traffic which
road transport is more suited to carry, but which, bv virtue of its former
monopoly position, it was obliged to serve.
2.04      Further details on these two modes of transport as well as on ports,
inland waterways and aviation is provided in Annex 2.
C.   Transport Investment and Coordination

/1   Budget allocation for 1971.
/2   Transport Sector Mission Report, Yeilow Cover, Septemcer 1972.
2.06      Investment in transport represented 24% of total Public Development
expenditure during the Second Plan period, and amounts to 20% of the proposed
total in the Third Plan period. The actual expenditure during the Second
Plan period 1967-71 came close to the planned figure, but there were numerous
alterations caused by faulty cost estimates and cost overruns. The dangers
inherent in inadequate planning are likely to be much greater in the Third
Plan period, partly because the sums involved are higher but also because
with the rapid development of a modern and sophisticated transport system,
most projects demand a closer and more detailed evaluation and there are
fewer projects of obviously high priority. For these reasons, the 1971
Transport Sector Mission recommended the strengthening of the planning
organization and some reductions in the Third Plan Investment Program, which
now amounts to about 15% of the planned Public Development expenditure
1972-76.
2.07      The Transport Sector Mission comprehensively reviewed the transport
sector in October 1971 and identified the need for improved transport
planning and coordination. The mission's recommendations have been discussed
with the Government which intends to set up:
(a)  a transport policy and planning committee to review and
recommend transport policies and investment programs for
Government approval; and
(b)  a transport planning unit in the Ministry of Communications
to act as a secretariat to the transport policy and planning



-4-
committee, to undertake the drafting of transnort policy
papers and formulation of transoort sector investment programs;
the unit will also develop and operate a transport information
system, to aid decision-making on transport matters.
During negotiations for the fifth highway loan the Government confirmed its
agreement to make the above institutional changes by December 31, 1973, and
agreed with the Bank on the scope and timing of related technical assistance.
2.08      For the railways, coordination with road transport is clearly of
first importance, especially at a time when the roads are rapidly improving
their capability for taking over functions to which rail transport is
inherently unsuited.
2.09      The biggest barrier to achieving proper coordination appears to
have been resistance on the part of the Government towards changes necessary
to allow road and rail to play their proper roles. For the railways this is
seen in the difficulties of obtaining permission to change train schedules
and close stations when warranted by changing conditions; or to raise rates
and fares when justified by cost levels and market considerations. For high-
ways, while generally competitive and efficient, there has recently appeared
within the Government some tendency for excessive regulatory policies in
favor of the Government-owned Express Transport Organization (E.T.O.), but
following discussions during negotiations the Government has satisfactorily
clarified its position in regard to these policies. The situation will be
kept under continuing review between the Bank and the Government.
2.10      This attitude of reluctance to change is to some extent understand-
able in view of the fact that the railways have not documented, in any
comprehensive way, their case for a more flexible attitude toward their problems.
The railways now, however, have prepared a report on the measures which need
to be taken to improve their financial position and train services.  The
report was approved by the Railway Board in December 1972, and was submitted
to the Ministry of Comnunications in February 1973.  During neantiations the
Bank was informed that SRT's Board of Commissioners has authorized imple-
mentation of changes in train schedules and other measures within i--s
authority. Other proposals in the report have been approved in principle
by Government and they will be taken into account in preparing the compre-
hensive olan covering all aspects of dieselization (para 4.07).
2.1-      Road/rail coordination should imnrove following the abolition in
October 1972 of the Ministry of National Development and the handing over of
its responsibility for highways to the Melinistry of Communications which is
now responsible for all transport planning and operations.
2.12      Another consideration in road/rail coordination is the level of
road user charges, in terms of duties and taxes on road vehicles, spares and
fuel, and registration fees on vehicles.  Here again the shortage of data
makes it difficult for the Government to pursue a policy of providing proper
ground rules for road/rail competition. For this reason a study was proposed



-5-
both by the 1971 Sector Mission and the Appraisal Mission for the Fifth
Highway Project. During negotiations for the fifth highway loan, it was
agreed that an appropriate time to initiate such a study would probably be
in 1974, after completion of the Bangkok Urban Transport Study and the high-
way maintenance study.
3. THE STATE RAILWAY
A.   Organization, Management and Staff
3.01      Management of SRT is in the hands of well qualified and competent
officials.
3.02      The Railway was established as an autonomous body by the State
Railway of Thailand Act dated June 5, 1951. There have been two amending
Acts dated June 11, 1959, and July 19, 1966. General supervision of SRT is
vested in the Minister of Communications, and responsibility for
policy-making and general affairs rests with a Board of Commissioners. The
members of the Board are appointed by the Council of Ministers: one of the
appointees is presently Under Secretary of State for Communications, and
three are retired senior officials of SRT.
3.03      Responsibility for management and administration of SRT is with
the General Manager who is appointed by the Board subject to the approval
of the Council of Mlinisters, and he is ex-officio a Board Member. Approval
of the Council of Ministers is required before (a) constructing new or
abandoning existing lines, (b) increasing or decreasing capital, (c)
borrowing money, (d) making sales of property, and (e) making changes in
standard rates and fares. 1/ General organization is on a functional
department basis and includes a separate Railway Bureau which operates
the Maeklong line (65 km) which serves the Bangkok area but is not connected
to the main network. An organization chart is shown at Annex 3.
3.04      Adequate arrangements are made for training of staff at a Railway
Training Center and for several years SRT has followed a policy of sending
senior officials for training in other countries. The general level of pay
for employees of SRT is higher than for corresponding grades in Government
service and while pay scales are somewhat lower than those in other industries,
this is offset by more generous fringe benefits and greater security of job-
tenure.
1/   SRT is authorized to make, at its own discretion, increases not
greater than 25% and reductions of not more than 50% in standard
rates.



-6-
B.   Financial Management
3.05      The financial management of SRT has generally been sound and the
accounts have been prepared in a satisfactory manner by qualified staff.
3.06      Accounts of SRT are prepared in accordance with commercial
accounting principles.  Depreciation of fixed assets is based on original
cost and estimated useful life; the cost of rail replacements is charged
to a renewals fund which is maintained on a satisfactory basis.
3.07      Annual budgets for capital spending have to be approved by the
Council of Ministers, but the operating budget of revenues and expenditure
is presented to the Council for information only. Any surplus from
operations is required to be handed over to the State after making provision
for approved capital investment, but in practice the amount handed over is
30% of the profits as a payment in lieu of income taxes from which SRT is
exempted; SRT is also exempted from business tax of 0.5% on gross revenue
applicable to transport undertakings but no other exemption from taxation
or import duties applies to SRT. Any deficiency from results of operations
is required to be met by State appropriation, provided sufficient funds
cannot be found from other sources.
3.08      Costs of the various operations and services provided by SPT are
established annually on a network basis and costs of carrying particular
commodities over separate sections are prepared as required for the purpose
of negotiating rates. Proposed improvements in financial profitability and
costing procedures are dealt with at paragraphs 4.07 and 5.11.
3.09      The Board is required to appoint auditors annually and in addition
the Audit Council shall, at the request of the Minister, examine the accounts
of SRT. The appointed auditor is in fact the Audit Council which reports
to the Board.of Commissioners, the Ministry of Finance and the Budget
Bureau (attached to the Prime Minister's Office). On serious matters the
Audit Council has the right to report direct to the last two mentioned
offices. Agreement has been reached that accounts will be audited in
accordance with satisfactory principles and that certiflied copies of accounts
and the auditors' reports will be sent to the Bank within five months of
the end of each financial year.
3.10      Covenants included in previous loan agreements with SRT have been
satisfactorily fulfilled.
C.   Property and Equipment
3.11      Railway property and equipment are generally well maintained.
3.12      As of September 30, 1971, SRT had 3,830 route-km, of which 90 km
were double track. Total length of track, excluding about 567 km of sidings,
is 3,920 km, of which 510 km (13%) are laid with 80 lb/yd rails and the rest
with 70 lb/yd or less. Track has been generally well maintained. There
are 59 km of bridges, of which 18 km (31%) are wooden.  Several of the
wooden bridges need strengthening.



-7-
3.13      SRT's motive power and rolling stock position is given in Table 2.
Steam locomotives are expected to be phased out by September 1976, except
those for emergency use. About 148 passenger cars (15%) are of wooden
structure and over 40 vears old. All these cars should be scrapped. SRT
has a central workshop at Makkasan, which deals with not only heavy repair
of motive power and rolling stock but manufactures rolling stock as well,
and three regional workshops, which deal with heavy repair of freight cars.
In order to reorganize maintenance operations in the Makkasan Workshop,
particularly in connection with the development of dieselization, the
requirements were reviewed by consultants (SOFRERAIL of France) in 1965,
whose recommendations are being followed up by SRT.
3.14      Further details of railway property and equipment are given
in Annex 4.
D.   Operational Performance
3.15      Table 3, which gives a summary of operating statistics from FY 1967
to 1971, shows that operating efficiency is generally good. Only about 21%
of train-km in FY 1971 were steam-operated, against 67% in 1960. Average
net train load of steam trains is 120 tons compared with 220 tons for
diesel trains (Malaysia: 205 tons for diesel), and average daily distance
traveled is 109 km for steam and 353 km for diesel trains (Malaysia: 225 km
for diesel).
3.16      The availability of steam locomotives at 77% in 1971 was low because
of their age. The availability of diesel locomotives at 85% in 1971 can be
further improved by adequate repair facilities and increased attention to the
recommendations made by the consultants in 1965. SRT is aiming at an avail-
ability of 90%. The daily output of 353 kn per engine available is acceptable.
Availability of diesel railcars is 89%, which is satisfactory. Selected inter-
national comparisons are given in Table 4.
3.17      The availability of passenger cars at 83% in 1971 should be improved.
SRT is aiming at an availability of 90%, by replacing 148 over-aged wooden
passenger cars with 79 newly manufactured steel cars. The average daily run
per passenger car available is 426 kIn, which is good.
3.18      The average load of freight cars has increased from 9.0 tons in
1967 to 10.2 tons in 1971, which corresponds to an average load factor of
74%. Freight car productivity of 253,000 ton-km per freight car available
in 1971 compared well with other railways (Malaysia 174,000; East Africa
230,000). The availability of freight cars, 86% and 90% for four-wheelers
and bogies respectively in 1971, needs to be improved. The introduction of
new bogie cars to replace over-aged cars in poor condition should enable
availability to increase to about 93% by 1976.
3.19      To improve operating performance and ensure optimum utilization of
the motive power and rolling stock, improvements in marshalling yards and
signalling are needed. SRT's efforts to improve operations include the
recent introduction of more block trains for oil, marl and cement movements.



During loan negotiations, SRT confirmed its intention to achieve by 1976 an
increase in the availability of locomotives and passenger cars from 85% to
90% and that of freight cars from 86% in the case of four wheelers and 90% in
the case of bogies, to 93% in both cases.
4. THE PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A.   The Plan
4.01      SRT's Investment Program for FY 1973-1976 -/, as revised following
discussions with the mission, is set out in detail in Table 5. A detailed
description of the items included appears as Annex 5 and a summary of the
major items is shown below:

* Retention money for diesel locomotives.
4.02      The Investment Program has as its broad objectives the achievement
of complete dieselization, track strengthening and expansion of the rolling
stock fleet to meet expected traffic increases. It was not, however,
founded on any comprehensive plan to re-shape the railway's future role to
meet the changing conditions of traffic needs and the technical advances
embodied in the Program itself. It assumed that existing train services
would continue to operate to the same timetable and serve the same stations
as they do now. It was not supported by evidence of profitability of the
various services (or of their economic viability), and was not accompanied
1/   Including items brought forward from the 1967-1971 Program.



-9-
by proposals for tariff re,riews which changing conditions, affecting both
the costs of railway servii,es and the demand for them, are bound to require.
For these reasons, the mis;ion reviewed in detail with SRT the changes in
train service which could e introduced following procurement of the first
lot of 54 diesel locomotivas out of the total of 109. Following this review
the investment program was revised to its present form which is realistic for
the first stage of the prcgram of which the proposed Bank project is a part.
4.03      Further revisioits to the second stage of the program can be expected
after the comprehensive pi3n to be prepared by September 30, 1974 (para 4.07)
is approved by the Governrient by March 31, 1975. In addition to improvements
in train services this comprehensive plan will include all aspects of the
final stages of SRT's program for phasing out the last of its steam locomotives
and turning completely to diesel traction. This is a major decision, calling
for new investment of about Baht 1.0 billion (including associated workshop
improvement and track-strengthening for heavier diesel locomotives), or
nearly 50% of the 1972-1976 program.
4.04      In FY 1971 the diesel locomotive fleet of 181 units represented
about 47% of the total mo':ive power fleet (excluding diesel railcars and
shunting locomotives), but performed about three-quarters of total locomotive-km.
By 1977 it is planned to Introduce 74 more diesel locomotives to replace the
remaining steam traction, plus a further 35 diesels to work additional trains.
In terms of locomotive numbers and utilization, the comparison between the
years 1971 and 1977 is expected to be as follows:

/1   Excludes diesel railcars and shunting locomotives.

/3   74 to replace steam and 35 for new services.
/4   This average includes the reduction in utilization of existing diesels
(para 4.05); the average annual utilization of the 109 new diesels
will be 120,000 km.



- 10 -
4.05      The average annual utilization of the 54 1800 hp diesels to be
procured under the project will be a high 158,600 km. The annual utilization
of the existing diesel locomotives, which will be replaced by the new diesels,
will decrease from 156,400 km to 85,300 km, because they in turn will
replace steam locomotives with a low 62,700 km in annual utilization. Some
deterioration of this kind is to be expected as the transfer to diesel
traction is completed. However, the 20 new diesels required in the final
stage of the program (FY 1975 and 1976) to complete the replacement of steam
traction will have a low annual utilization of 73,600 km, which is unsatisfactory
and will actually result in higher costs for some trains than is presently
experienced with steam traction. This situation arises because SRT's plans
for complete dieselization do not at present take account of rescheduling
of train operations which is essential for a sound investment plan.
4.06      A fresh look at these operations is, therefore, needed but it will
raise issues that go well beyond the first objective of substituting diesel
for steam traction, and cannot be divorced from an integrated planning of
other major aspects of the railway's operations. In seeking more satisfactory
use of its new locomotives, SRT should consider not only a rescheduling
of trains but an elimination of some stops altogether by concentrating
traffic at fewer terminals and closing the remainder. In some cases it may
become evident that operations cannot be improved sufficiently to justify
continuing services with diesel traction, in which case termination of
services should be seriously considered. The cost of retaining uneconomic
services should be identified.
4.07      Similar considerations are important in assessing the case for the
passenger and freight cars and other items in the final stages of the program.
Until the future scope and content of the railway's operations is established
on a rational basis, it is not possible to formulate a comprehensive
investment program. The SRT is fully aware of the need for a comprehensive
assessment but needs technical assistance in its preparation. Provision
has been made in the proposed loan for the cost of the required technical
assistance, and it was agreed during loan negotiations that:
(a)  SRT will, by September 30, 1974, prepare, with the
assistance of a transport specialist, a comprehensive
plan covering all aspects of the final stages of dieseliza-
tion including rescheduling of train services, the
identification of uneconomic services, and the expansion
of SRT's marketing and commercial activities coupled
with continuing reviews of costs and tariffs; and
(b)  Government will decide by March 31, 1975, with the SRT
and the Bank on the implementation of this comprehensive
plan.
The technical assistance will be provided to SRT under the project by the
appointment of one experienced railway advisor for a period of about one
year directly under the Deputy General Manager, Operations.



- 11-
4.08      The main objectives of the program deserve support, and there is
no difficulty in justifying an interim project covering the first stage of
the investment program, which will allow the railway and the Government the
necessary time to establish a rational plan as the basis for subsequent
investment decisions.
B.   The Project
4.09      The Project is part of SRT's investment program for the three fiscal
years ending September 30, 1975. 1/  The principal items included are pro-
curement of (a) 54 diesel locomotives, (b) 30 hopper cars, and (c) components
for production by the SRT workshop of about 150 passenger coaches and 470
freight cars. The project also provides for track (about 300 km) and bridge
strengthening (about 700 m) works and the expansion and modernization of
workshops, the major part of which are associated with the program of eventual
substitution of diesel for steam traction. Estimated cost of the project is
Baht 1,446 million (US$69 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange content
of US$47 million equivalent.  A summary of project expenditure is shown below:

The foreign exchange cost is the total estimated cost of direct foreign
procurement. Local expenditures will include only an insignificant amount
of foreign exchange.
4.10      Cost estimates for loccnotive and spares are based on the agreed
contract price. For other items, cost estimates are based on March 1973
prices and provision for price escalation has been made on the basis of
5% annual increase in foreign costs and 3% annual increase in local costs.
No separate provision for physical contingencies is necessary because the
project does not include major civil works. The cost estimates are reasonable.
Items to be financed by the proposed loan are detailed in Annex 6.
C.   Execution of the Project, Procurement and Disbursement
4.11      The proposed loan will be to SRT, with a guarantee from the
Kingdom of Thailand. SRT will be responsible for completion of the
project; it has the necessary facilities and is competent to carry out the
various work programs. The 150 passenger cars and 470 freight cars will
be manufactured by SRT at the Makkasan Workshon, within its present manufac-
turing capacity. The technical level of labor and facilities is adequate.
Manufacturing costs, including overhead, are on the average about 10% to 15%
lower than CIF cost of imported cars excluding custom duties and taxes.
Track strengthening of about 300 km will alsn be carried out by SRT on force
account.
4.12      All equipment financed by the proposed loan will be procured
through international competitive biddingin accordance with Bank procedures.
There is a possibility that local bids may be received for a small part of
track materials and related equipment. In the event of such bids being
successful, it is unlikely that local currency financing would exceed US$0.5
million equivalent. Normal domestic preference margin of 15% would apply.
Thailand has no preferential tariff agreements with any foreign country.
The loan makes provision for the cost of the services of a transport
specialist, who will assist SRT in long-term planning including the identifi-
cation of uneconomic services and the maintenance of a continuing review of
traffic flows and of rates and charges.
4.13      A contract has already been placed for the supply of 54 locomotives,
which are to be financed by a French Government loan and a Supplier's Credit.
Delivery of these locomotives will begin in mid-1974 and be completed in
early 1975. The technical assistance will begin in mid-1973 and be completed
in mid-1974. The project is expected to be completed by September 1976. The
Bank loan will be disbursed against 100% foreign expenditures for procurement
of imported materials, components and equipment and for technical assistance;
in case of local procurement, disbursement will be against ex-factory cost;
the estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 7.
4.14      Any savings under the loan will be used to finance additional, but
similar project items, subject to review and agreement with the Bank.

5.  FINANCES AND EARNINGS
A.   Past Performance
5.01      Revenue and Expenditure accounts of SRT from FY 1967 to 1971 are
shown in Table 6. During this period net income from operations has dropped
from Baht 182 million to Baht 97 million; the operating ratio has increased
from 79 to 90 and return on net fixed assets has declined from 3.6% to 1.7%.
Average receipt per ton-km for freight traffic (CL) dropped by about 7% which
was caused by the negotiation of special rates to attract additional bulk
traffic and a proportionately greater increase in the volume of low rated
traffic. During this five year period total personnel costs have increased
by 34% resulting from an increase in the average wage of 28% and an increase
in staff of 4%. Staff productivity has improved substantially considering
that there has been an increase in traffic of nearly 20%. However, total
operating costs have gone up by 28% and total revenue by only 14%. There has
been no general increase in rates and fares during the past 16 years.
5.02      In spite of this less favorable development, SRT had a net income
in 1971, after charging loan interest, of Baht 68 million (US$3.3 million)
and in that year its net cash generation from operations was sufficient
to cover total debt service payments three times over.  Furthermore, during
the period 1967-1971 SRT contributed from its own resources Baht 741 million
to its program of capital investment amounting to Baht 1,541 million while
avoiding any significant reduction in its substantial cash balances.
5.03      Following a review of all Government service pay scales, the
average cost of personnel on SRT increased in 1968 by 14.5%; subsequent
increases have been about 4% annually. These increases mean that while in
1967 personnel costs absorbed 39% of gross revenue, in 1971 the percentage
was 46% which is still reasonable compared with other railways. In absolute
terms, gross revenues in 1971 were Baht 120 million higher than in 1967 while
operating costs (excluding depreciation) were Baht 180 million higher. In
future years these trends will have to be arrested if a steadily worsening
cash situation is to be avoided (para. 5.11).
5.04      The 1972 balance sheet of SRT is shown as Table 7.  The ratio of
current assets to liabilities is 3.0:1.0. This ratio does not, however, truly
reflect the financial position because the assets include some old and
disputed balances (paragraph 5.05).
5.05      In their report on the 1972 accounts the auditors drew attention
to certain old balances in SRT accounts which have not been reconciled with
the Controller General and to old debts due from Government departments and
State enterprises. One other feature of SRT's accounts that requires
improvement is that inventory verifications should be supervised by the
internal audit section and they should be planned so as to make physical
verifications of all stocks at least once a year, reports on these verifica-
tions being submitted to the Financial Controller of SRT. The amount shown
in the 1972 accounts for Long Term Debt has been increased by about Baht 70
million to take account of the revaluation of foreign currencies; this



- 15 -
adjustment has been made by adding a corresponding amount to deferred
charges which it is intended to write off to retained income over the years
in which repayments are effected. In order to avoid showing a fictitious
asset it has been confirmed during negotiations that satisfactory arrangements
will be made to deal with such differences in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. During loan negotiations it was agreed that:
(a) Government will take measures to ensure that amounts
due to SRT in the future from its Departments or
Government agencies will be paid promptly to SRT and
that existing old balances will be settled not later
than October 1976.
(b) SRT will arrange as part of its internal audit function to
supervise the annual verification of all inventory items
carried out on a continuing basis and for verification
reports to be sent to SRT's Financial Controller.
(c) SRT will, whenever it is necessary to value, in Baht, the
debt payable in another currency, make such valuation at
the then current rates of exchange.
B. Financing Plan
5.06      Table 8 shows the forecast Source and Application of Funds for the
years 1973 to 1977. During the three years (1973-1975) in which the project
is to be financed, funds required by SRT and the source of such funds will
be as follows:

/1   Disbursement schedule in Annex 7.
5.07      The figures in paragraph 5.06 show that the proposed loan will
contribute 22% of total project costs, 27% will come from SRT's own resources,
9% from the Gcvernment and 42% from the French loan and credit.  The total
foreign exchange cost of the project is US$47.2 million, of which the
proposed loan will contribute 32%, the French financing 61% and the remaining



- 17 -
7Z will be found from SRT and Government resources. Following implementation
of the earnings covenant (para 5.11), the contribution from SRT resources
would be higher than indicated in the forecast and would reduce the Government's
contribution to no more than about Baht 20 million.  The proposed loan
would be for 20 years including four years of grace. Items to be financed
under the proposed loan are detailed in Annex 6.
5.08      It has been agreed during negotiations that as a condition of
effectiveness of the Banks' proposed loan, the conditions of effectiveness
of the French Bank's Credit Agreement shall have been fulfilled, and the
Borrower shall have certified in writing to the Bank that such conditions
have been fulfilled. The French Banks' Credit Agreement covers a French
Government loan of F 60 million (US$13.0 million) and a French Supplier's
Credit of F 74 million (US$16.0 million) for procurement of 54, 1800-hp diesel
locomotives.
5.09      The financing plan is satisfactory.  It has been agreed during
negotiations that Government will make available to SRT all funds it may
require to complete the project.
C.   Forecast Performance and Future Financial Policy
5.10      Table 9 shows SRT's forecast of revenue and expenditure for years
1972 to 1977. The forecast makes no provision for any increases in rates or
fares but assumes an annual increase in labor and material unit costs of 3%
and 2% respectively. These percentages are consistent with experience in
recent years. The forecasts also take account of operating economies
resulting from further dieselization and additional traffic to be carried.
The average annual increase in non-suburban passenger traffic is 5.6% and
in car-load freight traffic 3.9%. These figures are reasonable.
5.11      The forecasts show a decline in profitability and in 1977 there is
expected to be a deficit of Baht 61 million after charging loan interest of
Baht 110 million.  The operating ratio would be 95.6 and the return on net
fixed assets would be less than 1.0%.  Clearly such a situation is not
acceptable but instead of insisting on specific measures to maintain SRT's
financial viability it has been agreed during negotiations that SRT will
maintain fran FY 1974 a rate of return on net fixed assets not lower than
2.0% and will not incur any additional debt unless its cash generation
from onerations will be sufficient, after paying bonuses and Government's share
of profit, to cover all debt service payments at least 1.5 times. It has
also been agreed that SRT will by September 30, 1974, (i) complete a survey
to identify uneconomic stations and services, (ii) inform Government of the
amount of losses incurred on such services, and that Government on its part
will by March 31, 1975 authorize the abandonment of such services or pay
compensation to SRT for a financial loss identified by SRT if Government
decides the services shall be continued.
5.12      The means available to SRT to maintain a sound financial position
are quite varied. In the first place, average receipt per freight ton-km,
Satangs 15 (USd0.75), is low and as a result of the continuing review of



- 18 -
rates, should be capable of considerable improvement without loss of traffic.
Average receipt per pass-km at Satangs 12 (USkO.6) is also low. Apart fron
these generalizations, third class passenger fares in the greater Bangkok
area are only Satangs 6 per km compared with Satangs 10 in the rest of the
network. If the Bangkok area fares were to be increased to the general level,
there would be an increase in passenger revenue of about Baht 50 million a
year. In addition, the minimum charge for parcels traffic is absurdly low
at Baht 1.0. An increase in this minimum charge to Baht 10.0 coupled with
the raising of the lowest rates for LCL traffic would produce. a further Baht
20 million annually. SRT has adequate means available for maintaining its
present sound financial position and its proposals for obtaining additional
revenue are incoroorated in its report (para. 2.10) which is now under review
by the Ministry of Communications.
5.13      Taking SRT's own forecast of revenue and exnenditure for the year
1977, and assuming the three increases referred to in paragraph 5.12 are
implemented, it would be necessary for SRT to obtain additional net revenue
of about Baht 29 million in order to meet the recuirements of the earnings
covenant.  This should not be difficult and it would permit the generation
of adenuate funds towards SRT's capital investment program (about 55% of the
total requirement).
5.14      Forecast balance sheets to the year 1977 are shown as Table 10.
In preparing these figures it has been assumed that the whole of the
investment program as presently prepared will be implemented.  Some revision
of this program may be required following preparation of the comprehensive
plan (para 4.07).
6. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   The Project and The Third Development Plan 1972-76
6.01      The major objective of the Third Plan, of which the project forms
a part, is to achieve a real GDP growth rate of 7% a year. The Third Plan
gives higher priority than the Second Plan did to agriculture and education,
whose shares in public development expenditures are expected to increase
considerably. On the other hand, the share of expenditures for infrastruc-
ture works is reduced; In the case of transport sector investments, from 24%
in the Second Plan to about 15% in the Third Plan. This decrease relates
mainly to the reduced need for capacity increasing investments which were
of hizh relative priority during the 1960's. As a result, many of the
most serious bottlenecks in the transport sector were removed. On the other
hand, continuous investments are required for replacement and modernization of
the existing system, which is essential in order to respond to the general
development objectives. These investments, such as the project, result essen-
tially in cost reductions, but are frequently combined with some capacity
increases. Typical of these capacity increases is, however, that they are
obtained through improved operational efficiency rather than expansion of
the system. The project is thus designed to meet the essential renewal



- 19
requirements of the railways and to maintain its competitive position against
other modes by improved operational efficiency and modernization in order to
allow the railways to perform its proper economic role.
B.   Traffic
6.02      In FY 1971, the SRT transported 4.7 million tons of freight in
carloads (CL), 0.4 million tons in less-than-carloads (LCL), and over 48
million passenger trips. During the last decade CL net ton-km increased
from 1.1 billion in 1960 to 2.3 billion in 1971, corresponding to an annual
growth rate of 6.9%. Passenger traffic increased during the same period
from 2.3 billion to 4.3 billion passenger-km, an annual growth of 5.8%.
Only the LCL traffic has declined steadily. The table below gives a summary
of the traffic development. 1/ Details for the period 1967-71 are given in
Table 3.

1966      4.2  0.5    4.7         1.6                 46.0             3.2
1971      4.7  0.4    5.1         2.3                 48.2             4.3
6.03      The share of the SRT in freight and passenger traffic, relative to
that of the highways, has gradually declined during the 1960's, mainly due
to improvement and expansion of the highway network and vehicle fleet which
has resulted in a logical shift in the relative roles of road and rail
transport. The railway has lost local and LCL traffic, while it has been
able to compete relatively well for long distance passenger, and bulky,
unit load freight traffic. Table 11 analyzes SRT's 1967 and 1971 carload
freight traffic by main commodity categories and shows that seven commo-
dities (petroleum, rice products, cement, fluorspar, lumber, clinker and
marl, and corn) represented 64.5% of the total freight traffic in 1967
measured in ton-kms. This percentage had increased to 73.8% by 1971.
6.04      The SRT's forecast is that this development will continue during
1972-1977 (Table 11). The forecast implies an overall annual growth rate of
3.9% in ton-kmns, and will result in an increase in the relative share of
the seven most important commodities (para. 6.03) to 77.6% by 1977; no
increase has been assumed for the remaining part of CL traffic. The LCL
traffic is assumed to follow the past declining trend, representing about
5% of the total tonnage in 1977, compared with about 8% in 1971. The freight
traffic forecast is considered realistic. It takes into account the expected
1/   The project evaluation excludes U.S. military traffic, which is of
minor importance.



- 20 -
decrease in economic growth during the period 1972-76 compared with the
performance of the economy during the 1960's (para 2.03). In addition to
the changed overall growth rate, the forecast is based on an analysis of
the future transport requirements for each main commodity group. This
analysis takes into account, besides the future production and consumption
levels and patterns, the competitive situation between the railways and other
nodes of transport, particularly highways. The SRT realistically assumes
that it will not be able to compete with the highways for general cargo even
with the present low railway tariffs. On the other hand, about 80% of SRT's
freight consists of bulk transport, which is less sensitive to relative
changes in road/rail charges. However, also for this freight the railways
have assumed increased competititon; for instance, the railways' petroleum
traffic is expected to increase by about 4.3% annually, even if the overall
increase of this traffic is estimated to be close to 10,, annually. The
forecast therefore takes into account the effect of an upward adjustment of
the long distance freight tariff which may result from the proposed review
of costs and tariffs (paras. 2.10 and 4.07).
6.05      The SRT's forecast for passenger traffic during the period
1972-1977 is shown in Table 12. The forecast assumes that the level of
traffic from short and medium distance journeys of less than 300 km will
remain constant due to keen road conpetition, while the long distance pas-
senger traffic, representing 41.5% of the total in 1971, will increase annually
by 5.6%, resulting in an increase of 2.5% per annum for the total pas-
senger traffic, compared with the 5.8% annual growth achieved during the
1960's. As for freight traffic, the passenger traffic forecast is considered
realistic. It takes into account the highways' strong competitive position
concerning the short and medium distance traffic. This situation is less
likely to change because some increases have been proposed in tne railways'
commuter fares in greater Bangkok area, which at present are very low (para
5.12).  The railways' competitive position is considered better fcr long
distance passenger traffic, a situation which is expected to cor;tinue with
the introduction of additional express trains and reduced travel times. This
conclusion is supported by the fact that SRT has been particularly success-
ful during recent years in operation of long distance express trains with
growth rates double those for ordinary passenger trains in spite of-about
25% higher fares.
6.06      Most of the increase in freight and passenger traffic indicated
in Tables 11 and 12 will be met through improved utilization of existing
,Ii.esel locomotives and rolling stock. The future utilization of existing
and new rolling stock to be procured under the project has been analyzed
in Annex 8. The required increase in capacity will be provided by slightly
higher average loads per car and by the fact that the new diesels will
provide an additional capacity of about 96 million ton-km, i.e., with about
18% of the required increase in freight-carrying capacity from 1972 to 1977
and about 50, of the required increase in passenger-carrying capacity during
the same period. A summary of present and proposed train operations is
presented in Table 13, while Annex 9 includes the planned rescheduling of
train operations.



- 21 -
C.   Evaluation of the Project
6.07      The Project is designed to enhance the efficient operation of the
SRT by: (a) reducing present operating costs; (b) increasing the rail-
ways' capacity for carrying traffic; and (c) improving service levels and
safety. The emphasis of the project is on reduction of operating costs
to be obtained through continued dieselization, replacement of rolling stock
and modernization of workshops. Closely connected with these cost-reductions
is an increase in the traffic-carrying capacity. Improvement in service
levels and safety will be obtained simultaneously with cost reductions and
capacity increases. The project represents essentially a continuation of
SRT's dieselization, renewal and modernization program, which for
dieselization will be completed by the end of the 1972-76 Investment Program.
The components included in the project were carefully selected with the purpose
of achieving an optimum result in this part of the program by simultaneously
removing a number of important, interdependent bottlenecks. Thus the neces-
sary replacement of old steam locomotives 1/ with 1800 hp diesel locomotives
was combined with rail renewals, bridge strengthening and workshop moderni-
zation, all necessary investments to improve the operating efficiency and
to utilize the new diesels. These project components were combined with
procurement of new rolling stock, partly for replacement of worn-out
passenger and freight cars, and partly to provide for an increased carrying
capacity to meet the future increase in railway traffic (paragraph 6.06).
As such the project will provide for a harmonious improvement within the
main operational areas of the railways with a gradual increase in capacity
closely corresponding to the expected increase in traffic. The project
was also designed to maximize flexibility of decision during the latter
part (1975-76) of the Investment Program (1972-76) when results of .the
comprehensive plan covering all aspects of the final stages of dieselization
are available (para 4.07).
6.08      The benefits resulting from the project investment have been cal-
culated from (a) savings in locomotive and rolling stock operating and
maintenance costs and (b) additional benefits resulting from increased
capacity. The reduction in operating costs has been estimated by major
investment items. This breakdown has, however, not been possible for
additional benefits from increased capacity, which represent a combined
effect of all main investment components. Also it has not been possible to
quantify the benefits to be obtained from increased traffic safety.
(i) Diesel Locomotives
6.09      The proposed use of the 54 1800 hp diesel locomotives has been
detailed in Annex 8, and Table 13. The net effect of the procurement will
be as follows:
1/   Steam locomotives as well as spare parts are not available from any
manufacturers.



- 22 -
(a)  116 steam locomotives, producing at present 5.2 million
locomotive km, will be scrapped;
(b)  the revenue-earning capacity of the trains affected by
the dieselization will increase by about 12%, due to
increased trainloads and higher average speeds; and
(c)  in addition, one new express will be introduced which
will further increase the revenue-earning capacity
of the railway.
The introduction of new diesels will involve several steps:  42 of the
new diesels will replace 46 existing smaller diesels (of between 440 and
1320 hp), which in turn will replace 78 steam and Davenport diesels. The
latter diesels, used at present for shunting, will finally replace 13 steam
locomotives. Only 25 of the steam locomotives will be replaced directly
with 10 new, bigger diesels.  In addition, 2 1800 hp diesels will be used
for operating the new express train.
6.10      The estimated variable operating costs, net of taxes, for the
new 1800 hp diesels, existing smaller diesels, and for steam locomotives
are shown in Table 14. These costs, which have been estimated by SRT, are
acceptable and comparable to those for neighboring Malaysia. The operating
costs of the 1800 hp diesels are about 10% higher per train-km than for
the smaller diesels which they will replace. The cost per traffic unit (ton-km
and/or passenger-km) will however be reduced because of increased average
net train loads. On the other hand, the operating costs of the 1800 hp
diesels will, per train-km, be less than half those for steam locomotives;
the cost per traffic unit will be reduced considerably more in cases where
steam traction is directly replaced by diesel because the average net train
loads will be more than doubled.
6.11      Annual savings in locomotive operating costs amount to Baht 36.9
million in 1975, after the new diesels have been procured (Table 15),
representing a 317 reduction in present operating costs on the affected
services. This reduction is highly satisfactory considering that it is
related to an advanced stage of changeover to diesel traction.
6.12      It is estimated that the operating costs of steam will increase
annually by 4.0% if not replaced by diesel, because of increased maintenance
and repair costs. As a result, the savings in operating costs will also
increase correspondingly over the 25-year economic lifetime of the new
diesel locomotives to be produced (Table 15).
6.13      The financial cost of the 54 1800 hp diesels is Baht 620 million
excluding spare parts (Table 16). The economic cost of these diesels has
been calculated at,Baht 525.0 million, excluding customs duties and taxes
of Baht 95.0 million which were calculated on the basis of rates presented
in Table 17, and allowing for scrap values of Baht 30,000 per steam locomotive
to be replaced.



- 23 -
(ii) Rolling Stock
6.14      The project includes procurement of components for 150 passenger
and 470 freight cars to be manufactured locally bv SRT. Local manufacture
is pteferred in this case, because SRT alreadv has the required technical
capability and is competitive in economic terms (Annex 5, paras 5 and 6).
The cost advantage is about 10-15% excluding customs duties and local taxes of
about 10-15% on CIF price (Table 17).  The main reasons for.this cost
advantage are (a) that labor costs are considerably lower in Thailand than
in the major manufacturin g countries and (b) that the cars are manufactured
by utilization of SRT's available workshop capacity.
6.15      The 150 passenger and 470 freight cars to be manufactured will
result in:  (a) reduced maintenance cost by replacement of rolling stock
with service life exceeding 40 years; and (b) increased traffic-carrying
capacity to cater for the expected increase in passenger and freight volumes
up to the year 1976. Utilization of passenger and freight cars from 1972 to
1974 has been analyzed in Annex 10.  According to this analvsis, the increase
in passenRer and freight cars is needed to provide for the expected increase
in railway traffic. The new rolling stock will result in a reduction of
the annual maintenance costs as specified in Annex 11. The savings have
been estimated to Baht 12.01 million in 1975, with a 4.0% annual increase
in future due to avoidance of increasin Fcosts on existing stock.
6.16      The financial cost of the rolling stock to be manufactured is
Baht 241.3 million (Table 16). The economic cost has been calculated
at Baht 196.6 million, excluding taxes and customs duties on components,
but including local manufacturing costs.
(iii) Improvement of Railway Infrastructure,
Workshops and Operational Facilities
6.17      The improvement of railway infrastructure, workshops and opera-
tional facilities includes the investment components additional to the
procurement of diesel locomotives and manufacture of rolling stock. The
main components are rail replacement; expansion and modernization of work-
shops; bridge strengthening; procurement and laying of concrete sleepers;
and station yard remodeling.  Most of these investments are necessary for
utilization of the new, heavier diesel locomotives and freight cars due to
increased axle loads. However, the whole railwav operations will be favor-
ably affected and the future procurement of additional locomotives and
rolling stock will benefit as well.
6.18      The benefits directly quantiffable consist of reduction in onera-
ting, maintenance and repair costs resulting from the inorovea facilities.
These benefits amount to Baht 27.63 million in 1975 (Annex 12). In addition,
the remaining, less important, items in the project will provide benefits
over the medium and long run in improved operations, staff efficiency, and
general service level of the railways. These benefits are not, however,
directly quantifiable and are not included in the economic return
calculation.



- 24 -
6.19      The total financial cost of these project components is Baht 461
millionl/ (Table 16). The taxes and customs duties amount to Baht 56 million
calculated on basis of rates presented in Table 17. The economic cost has
been calculated at Baht 405 million excluding these taxes and duties.
(iv) Benefits from Increased Canacity
6.20      The project will result in an increase in revenue earning capacity
of the railways by about 335 million passenger-km and about 96 million ton-km
(Annex 8), which will be utilized gradually over the three-year period
1975-1977. In financial terms, the project will increase SRT's revenue
earning capacity by Baht 56.35 million a year which will result in annual
net revenues of Baht 50.79 million (Table 18), after deducting marginal
cost detailed in Annex 13. In economic terms, the benefits to the economy
represent the difference in costs, net of taxes, in carrying this traffic
bv railways or alternatively by highways. This cost difference has been
calculated at Baht 0.09 per passenger-km and Baht 0.25 per ton-Im2/, which
would indicate total annual benefits to the economy of about Baht 54
million.  In this particular case the financial net revenues to SRT and
the benefits to the economy are of similar magnitude. This situation would,
of course, change with changes in railway traffic.
D. Economic Feasibility of the Project
6.21      The project will result in an economic rate of return (ER) of
about 13% as suimmarized in Table 19. This return is considered satis-
factory. The project was carefully designed to achieve optimum results
during the first stage of SRT's Investment Program 1972-76 by simultaneously
removing a number of important and interdependent bottlenecks (para. 6.07).
The project was also designed to maximize flexibility of decision diuring the
latter part (1975-76) of the Investment Proaram in order to incorporate the
results of the comprehensive plan covering all aspects of the final stages
of dieselization to be completed by 1977 (para. 4.07). As such, the project
represents a feasible interim measure covering the earlier vears of the
Investment Program, which will allow the railway and the Government the
necessary time to establish a rational plan as a basis for subsequent invest-
ment decision (para. 4.08). As indicated in Annex 8, only about 5% of the
total train-kms remain to be dieselized after procurement of the 1800 hp
diesel locomotives.
6.22      The ER of 13% is not sensitive to changes in benefit and traffic
growth rates3/ and the greater part of the investment cost is based on
firn estimates, while locomotive costs are based on a firm contract.
1/   Excluding operational spares for locomotives Baht 86 million.
2/   The additional cost for railways was calculated as indicated in Table 18;
for highways it was calculated on basis of average variable costs.
3/   A change of + 20% in the benefit growth rate will result in only a +
1% change in the ER.



- 25 -
6.23      The year 1977 represents the first year full benefits are obtained
due to the gradual increase in net revenues over the three-year period 1975-
77 (Table 15). In the latter year the benefits represent 11X of the total
economic project costs, which is acceptable and in line with the estimated
ER of 13%.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) Preparation and arrangements for implementation of a
comprehensive plan covering final stages of dieselization
(para 4.07);
(b) Adoption of earnings covenant and limitation on future
long-term debt (para 5.11); and
(c) Identification of uneconomic services and arrangements
for their discontinuance or for Government compensation
for the losses incurred.
7.02      As a condition of effectiveness of the Bank's proposed loan it
has been agreed that the conditions of effectiveness of the French Banks'
Credit Agreement shall have been fulfilled (para 5.08).
7.03      On the basis of the agreements reached, a Bank loan of US$15.0
million is recommended to be made to the State Railway of Thailand, with a
guarantee from the Kingdom of Thailand, for a 20 year term including 4 years
of grace.

FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Previous Transportation Projects
A.   Highways - Loans:  341-TH, June 1963, US$35 million (First); 455-TH,
June 1966, US$36 million (Second); 535-TH, May 1968, US$29 million
(Third); 626-TH, June 1969, US$23 million (Fourth); 870-TH, December
1972, US$28.6 million (Fifth).
1.        The main objectives of these projects were:
(a) construction of 1,860 km of national highways;
(b) feasibility studies and detailed engineering of roads to be
constructed;
(c)  purchases of maintenance equipment; and
(d) technical assistance to the Department of Highways, mainly
to improve its capabilities in planning and maintaining
the highway network.
2.        The First Highway Project was completed on schedule; about US$13.1
million of the loan amount was cancelled because, at the Government's
request, some road sections to be constructed were removed from the project.
The Closing Date of the Second Highway Project was extended from September
30, 1970 to July 31, 1972 because construction of some road sections and
the feasibility study and detailed engineering of one section took longer
than originally scheduled. US$4.9 million was cancelled as most of the
contingency allowance was not required. The Closing Date of the Third
Highway Project has been extended by six months to complete the construction
of one section which was delayed by floods, to complete detailed engineering
of provincial roads to be constructed under the Fifth Highway Project, and
to settle final payments. The Government intends to request cancellation
of US$4.0 million of the loan which is expected to be surplus. No signi-
ficant problems have arisen on the Fourth Project, which is expected to
be completed on schedule and within the cost estimates.  No evaluation can
yet be made on the Fifth Project as it was only recently signed (December
1972).
B.   Ports - Loans:  37-TH, October 1950, US$4.4 million (First); 151-TH,
October, 1956, US$3.4 million (Second); and 702-TH, August 6, 1970,
US$12.5 million (Third).



ANNEX 1

3.        The first two projects were completed on schedule; about US$141,000
of the contingency allowance in the loan amount for the Second Project was
cancelled. However, the Third Project is about 18 months behind schedule
primarily because of delays in awarding civil works contracts.
C.   Railways - Loans:  35-TH, October 1950, US$3 million (First); 128-TH,
August 1955, US$12 million (Second); and 280-TH, April 1961, US$22
million (Third).
4.        The first two projects were completed satisfactorily; about US$7.5
million of the loan amount for the Third Project was cancelled because the
Borrower chose to purchase equipment according to procedures that did not
conform to Bank Group "Guidelines for Procurement". The third project was
fully disbursed in October 1967 and is complete except for minor work on Bang
Sue marshalling yard which was due to be in full operation by mid-1973.

FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Economic Setting and Transport Sector
A.   Economic Setting
1.        Thailand, in Southeast Asia, is in area 514,000 km2 and had a
population of 37.3 million in 1971. Climate and topography do not
seriously impede transport movements but the long distances between
borders necessitate long journeys for both passengers and freight. The
climate is monsoon tropical, with three rainy seasons. Plains and rivers
dominate the topography in central parts of the country.  Mountains occupy
most of the north and extend along the western border with Burma through
the Malay Peninsula (including the Kra Isthmus). Two major rivers, the
Mekong and Chao Phya, originate in these mourtains. The Mekong encircles
the dry northeastern plateau, forms the border with Laos, and flows into
the Khmer Republic. The Chao Phya and its tributaries irrigate the fertile
Central Plain and end in the Gulf of Thailand. The country is divided into
the Central, Northern, Northeastern and Southern Regions. (See Map.)
2.        Thailand is predominantly rural.  About 85% of the population
lives outside urban centers and earns its livelihood from agriculture.
Bangkok, the political, commercial, cultural, and now the industrial center,
is the only major city. Its population is increasing by over 5% per annum
(compared with a country average of 3%) and is now over 3 million.
3.        Past development concentrated heavily around Bangkok where most
of the manufacturing plants, public utilities and services were located.
A large share of investments in agriculture, particularly irrigation works,
were also made in the Central Plain. Large income disparities prevailed
between Bangkok, with a per capita income of $500 in 1970, and the rest of
the country, with a per capita income of $140. In the Northeast, where
the government was particularly concerned over security conditions, efforts
were made to promote community development by road building and provision of
utilities, such as power and water, but there was slight progress in
developing the region's productive capacity.
B.   Transport Sector
Highways
4.        Following the substantial and sustained growth in the 1960's,
the number of cars, buses and trucks reached some 370,000 by 1970 (Table 1).



ANNEX 2
Page 2
Nearly 60% of these were registered in Bangkok, where there were 14 times as
many vehicles (70 per 1,000 population) as in the rest of Thailand (5 per
1,000). The vehicle density in Bangkok may be compared with a similar
density in Manila; while it was considerably lower, 30 or less per 1,000
population, in most other capitals in the region such as Taipei, Seoul,
Djakarta. The difference does not reflect similar differences between per
capita incomes, but depends on local policies and consumer preferences.
5.        Road investments originally Dlanned under the program for the
period FY 72 to FY 76 total more than Baht 16.6 billion (US$800 million),
which is about 40% more in current prices than expenditure in the previous
five years. The main items are the construction and improvement of some
13,500 km of national, provincial, and local roads which, if implemented,
could be expected to give further substantial imnetus to the growth of
road transport. This program, is, however, under review and will most
likely be substantially reduced for the following reasons:
(i)  the original program exceeded the funds available;
(ii)  some of the projects included in the program were of
uncertain justification and are being re-examined by the
Department of Highways and consultants (P. T. Sullivan &
Partners);
(iii)  the revised program will be more realistic in relation
to a practical project preparation and implementation
schedule.
Railwavs
6.        The State Railway of Thailand (SPT) operates over a 3,830 route-km
system, all of which is meter gauge and, apart from one 90 km double-track
section between Bangkok and Ban Pachi, is all single-track. The system
offers good potential for railway oDerations, with traffic passing to and
from points as far away from Bangkok as 1,100 km in the South (where
traffic is exchanged with the Malayan Railway system), and 750 km ir: the
North.
7.        The railway has demonstrated some success in exploiting its inherent
advantages for long-dist ace and large-scale bulk transport, but it is
still regarded as a cormmon carrier for all types of traffic on the routes
it serves, a role which is becoming out-moded as alternative road services
are develoned. While some 480 stations are still open for traffic, or one for
every 8 km of route, some 70% of freight traffic is forwarded and received
at only 18 stations, five of which are in Bangkok, and seven others are on
the busiest northern route between Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Passenger
movements are more widely dispersed, but in FY 71 only 26 stations handled
more than 1,000 originating passengers a day, while some 240 others with
passenger traffic dealt with less than 100 a day.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
8.        This contrast, between intensive operations at a few terminals
and very light traffic at a large number of others, is also reflected in
the types of train services provided by SRT. For customers offering large
tonnages of bulk traffic between private sidings the railway provides more
than 250 block trains a month. At the same time, many freight, passenger
and mixed trains are required to serve all stations on a route, and the
slow average speed, typically combined with low train loading, results in
high-cost operations as well as an inferior service to the railway's customers.
The amount of cross-subsidization between profitable and unprofitable traffic
is not known because no comprehensive review of profitability has yet been
attempted. There is an urgent need for such a review, particularly before
the latter part of the 1972-1976 Investment Program is implemented. The
proposed technical assistance (para. 4.07) includes suitable support in
the preparation of such a review.
Ports
9.        The port of Bangkok handles annual traffic of about 10 million
tons (including bulk petroleum products of about 2.5 million tons), which
accounts for over 80% of the country's international sea trade and about 40%
of its coastal traffic. In spite of the substantial dependence on a single
port, Bangkok is not accessible to large modern vessels, because of its
shallow and winding approaches. As a result, there has been lengthy study
of two alternative sites:  at Laem Krabang (by NEDECO), about 120 km
southeast of Bangkok, and at Sattahip (by Louis Berger Inc.), about 56 km
farther south, where an existing modern port is now used exclusively for
military purposes. Selection of a site is expected during 1973 lwhen
studies of the alternative sites will be available.
Inland Waterways
10.       Thailand has an inland waterways system of about 1,600 km (including
some 500 lm open only seasonally), serving principally the Central Plains
from Bang?zok northwards. From the latest figures available (for 1966) the
waterways carry some seven million tons of traffic annually to Bangkok, but
only half a million tons in the reverse direction. More than half of the
southerly flow consists of sand and other building materials. Freight
rates are low in relation to the road and rail equivalents and it is
reasonable to assume that operating costs are also low. Thte scope for com-
petition with other modes, however, is limited by the inconvenience and
costs of collection and delivery by truck for many points away from the
waterways, as well as the need for increased inventories associated with
this slow means of transport. The main limitations to the development of
inland waterways are the cited directional imbalance of the traffic, the
lack of year-around navigability of part of the system, the cost of dredging
and the competing demands on water for irrigation and power.
Aviation
11.       Air transport is of importance to Thailand and its thriving
tourist business, international passenger arrivals at Bangkok having



ANNEX 2
Page 4
grown by over 25% p. a. since 1966 and reaching 620,000 by 1970. Domestic
passenger traffic grew by more than 18% p. a. in the sane period, amounting
to 220,000 passengers by 1970. This figure is negligible when compared
with the 48 million passengers traveling by rail in that year, but a more
appropriate comparison is with first class rail passengers, who numbered
only 125,000. Domestic air freight traffic is still insignificant.

FOURTI RAILWAY PROJECT
Detailed Description of Railway Property and Equipment
Railway Lines
1.        As of September 30, 1971, SRT operated 3,765 route-km of meter
gauge, mostly single track. The Maeklong Line of 65 route-km, which serves
the west side of the Bangkok area, is entirely separated from the main
network 1/. Four major railway lines, Northern, Northeastern, Eastern and
Southern, radiate from Bangkok and a section of 90 km between Bangkok and
the Bang Pachi junction on the Northern Line is double-tracked. About 95%
of the alignment has a gradient of less than 1% and a curve radius of over
500 m. There are some sections in mountainous areas near Chiengmai, with
a gradient of 2.6% and curves of 180 m radius. There are 2,000 m of tunnels
and 59 km of bridges, of which 18% are wooden. Work on the needed
strengthening of wooden bridges is progressing.
2.        The total length of track, excluding about 567 km of sidings,
is 3,855 km, of which 510 km are laid in 80 lb/yd rails, 2,478 km in 70 lb/yd,
484 km in 60 lb/yd rails and the rest in 50 lb/yd rails; 13% of track is
under 10 years old and 10% more than 40 years.  All renewals of principal
lines are with 80 lb/yd rails. Some 388 km of track on the Northern and
Northeastern Lines have welded rails with either wooden or concrete
sleepers. The latter are manufactured in Thailand but their use is still
in an experimental stage. Most of the track is laid with 20 cm of ballast
and ballast is mostly crushed stone of high quality. Track is generally
well maintained. SRT has carried out rail renewals on a programmed basis
but there have been no renewals in FY 1972. SRT proposes to undertake
(i) renewals of 312 km of track, (ii) laying of concrete sleepers over
100 km of track and (iii) replacement of 274 sets of points and crossings
during the period FY 1973-1976.
3.        Signalling arrangements consist of color signals in the Bangkok
area and token block instruments on most main lines. The treadle type
tokenless block system has been installed on about 18% of all lines,
including a double track section. Various types of interlocking devices
between signals and points are provided at about 60% of the stations.
1/   Unless otherwise mentioned, the description excludes the Maeklong
line.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
SRT plans (i) the installation of interlocking devices at 30 more stations,
and (ii) the imnrovement of the signalling systems at 51 stations.
4.        Dispatcher telenhone channels have been provided at 13 dispatching
offices and a teletype printer network links 18 major stations. SRT plans
to (i) introduce a 2-way radio system in major marshalling yards to improve
shunting efficiency in the yards and (ii) replace older aerial cables with
underground ones on the section between Bangkok and Bang Sue, both to
improve the quality of communications and to respond to environmental
requirements due to recent development in the city area.
5.        A new mechanized marshalling yard at Bang Sue is nearing completion,
and aims at increasing the handling capacity of freight cars in the Bangkok
area from the present 1,500 to 2,500 cars daily. Full operation is
expected in mid-1973. In addition to these carry-over works from the
previous Investment Program, SRT plans to introduce twqo specially designed
diesel shunting locmotives to be used exclusively for hulmp operations
during the period FY 1973-1976. There are two major regional marshalling yards
with a car-handling capacity of about 500 cars daily, at Sila At and Had Yai.
In order to meet cement and log traffic requirements recently developed in
the southern area, the building of a new marshalling yard at Thung Song is
being undertaken.
6.        In general, the buildings, stations, offices and general plant
of the railways are well maintained. However, some improvements are needed
in certain stations and yards which are being planned.
Motive Power and Rolling Stock
7.        As of September 30, 1971, the fleet consisted of 422 locomotives
(231 steam, 191 diesel), 90 diesel railcars (45 powered, 45 trailers),
990 passenger cars, and 9,178 freight cars (7,160 four-wheelers, 2,018
bogies) . SRT plans to phase out steam locomotives by September 1976 by
introducing 109 diesel locomotives, 54 in FY 1974 and 1975, and the
remaining 55 in FY 1975 and 1976. Contract for 54 locomotives has already
been placed, but the proposed procurement of a further 55 locomotives
requires re-examination in the light of re-scheduling of services in order
to avoid poor utilization.
8.        About 148 passenger cars, 15% of the total fleet, are of wooden
body structure and over 40 years old; they are to be scrapped and
replaced by 79 passenger cars to be manufactured in the Makkasan workshop
during the period FY 1973-1976. Also planned is the manufacture of 131 cars
to meet increased Dassenger traffic during the same period.
9.        About 372 freight cars, 4% of the total fleet, are in poor
condition and over 40 years old; they are to be scrapped and replaced by
178 bogie freight cars to be manufactured in the Makkasan workshop during
the period FY 1972-1976. Also planned is the nurchase of 30 cars from abroad
and the manufacture of 534 freight cars to meet increased freight traffic
during the same period. Existing 40-ton automatic freight car couplers



ANNEX 4
Page 3
are sufficient to bear the increased train load resulting from the introduc-
tion of diesel locomotives with a heavier train load capacity. Existing
crossing loops at stations are now mostly 500 m long and will be able to
accommodate the heavier train loads.
10.       SRT presently has one central workshop at Makkasan and three
regional workshops at Uttaradit, Korat and Thung Song. The Makkasan workshop
deals with heavy repairs of all types of motive power and rolling stock,
together with manufacture of passenger and freight cars. The regional
workshops deal with heavy repairs of freight cars, which exceed the capacity
of the Makkasan workshop. In order to reorganize maintenance operations
in the Makkasan workshop, particularly in connection with the development
of dieselization, the requirements were reviewed by consultants (SOFRERAIL of
France) in 1965, who recommended that (i) an annual routine maintenance
schedule for diesel locomotives be shifted from the workshop to the
locomotive running sheds, which should be provided with appropriate
machinery to take over such a schedule, and (ii) light unscheduled repairs
be carried out in the locomotive running sheds. The recommendations have
been followed up by SRT and the reorganization is still going on. Some
expansion and modernization of the Makkasan workshop and the Bang Sue
locomotive running shed are planned during the period FY 1973-1976.

FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Investment Program 1973-1976 - Main Items
A.   Balance of 1967-1971 Investment Program (carry-over works)
54 Diesel Locomotives & Spare Parts (28.8% of total expenditure)
1.        As a first stage of complete dieselization, SRT has already placed
the order for 54 mainline diesel electric locomotives. Delivery will be
completed in early 1975 and will at least enable the railway to phase out
steam traction north of Chumporn. The new locomotives will consist of units
of 1300 hp, as compared with the existing ones of 950 to 1500 hp, and will
be able to haul a 1,200-ton, or a 36-bogie car train, which is an improvement
on present operations. The new engines will have an axle-load of 14 tons,
as compared with a maximum of 13 tons in the existing diesel fleet. The
increased load will require at least a rail weight of 70 lb/yd, necessitating
the replacement of 60 lb/yd rails still in use on some main line sections.
30 Bogie Hopper Cars and Spare Parts (0.7% of total expenditure)
2.        To make track maintenance work more efficient, 30 bogie ballast
hopper cars and spare parts are to be purchased.
Station Yard Remodelling (1.4% of total expenditure)
3.        This mainly includes carry-over works for the new marshalling
yard at Bang Sue. The works were almost completed except for two shunting
locomotives. The new marshalling yard with a daily capacity for handling
2,500 freight cars will be put into full operation in mid-1973. In
addition to works at the new Bang Sue yard, the construction of a new
regional mars'halling yard at Thung Song is also included under this item.
B.   Balance of 1972-1976 Investment Program
55 Diesel Locomotives & Spare Parts (24.6% of total expenditure)
4.        As a final stage of complete dieselization, SRT tentatively plans
to further introduce 55 1500 hp diesel electric locomotives, including
35 diesels as additions necessary to meet increased traffic needs for the
entire railway network. The 55 locomotives are expected, according to SRT,
to be delivered in FY 1975 and 1976. However, this figure of 55 needs
further review because it is based, for the most part, on introducing



ANNEX 5
Page 2
diesels into traditional steam services and takes inadequate account of
the much more intensive utilization possible with diesel traction.
Passenger Cars (8.1% of total expenditure)
5.        Of the nominal fleet of 990 passenger cars, about 148 cars, 15%
of the total fleet, are of wooden body structure and over 40 years old.
These are to be scrapped and replaced by manufacturing 79 passenger cars
in the Makkasan workshop in order to increase availability and to reduce
repair costs. In addition, 131 cars are planned to be manufactured as additions
to meet increased passenger traffic. The technical level of the workers and
facilities provided at the Makkasan workshop are adequate and the manufacture
costs including overheads are, on the average, lower by about 25% than CIF
costs of imported cars including taxes. The total of 210 manufactured passen-
ger cars comprise 130 bogie third class cars, 22 bogie baggage cars and 58
other cars of various types. Foreign exchange under this item comprises
components necessary to assemble the cars, such as bogie trucks, coupler
bodies and draft gears, alternator, steel sheets.
Freight Cars (6.5% of total expenditure)
6.        Of the nominal fleet of 9,178 freight cars, about 372 cars, 4% of
the total fleet, are in poor condition and over 40 years old. These are
to be scrapped and replaced by manufacturing 178 bogie freight cars in the
Makkasan workshop in order to increase availability and to reduce repair
costs. In addition, 534 cars are planned to be manufactured as additions to
meet increased freight traffic. The technical level, facilities, and costs
of car manufacture are acceptable on the same basis as for passenger cars.
The total of 712 manufactured freight cars comnrise 260 bogie covered cars,
190 bogie gondola cars, 180 bogie oil-tank underframes, 40 bogie flat
cars and 42 brake vans. Foreign exchange under this item comprises
components necessary to assemble freight cars, such as bogie trucks, coupler
bodies and draft gears, steel sheets and plates.
Breakdown Cranes (0.7% of total expenditure)
7.        This comprises acquisition of two new breakdown cranes with
spare parts to restore damaged sections and reopen lines as quickly as
possible in case of accidents.
Bridge Strengthening (2.1% of total expenditure)
8.        Of 58,680 m of bridge spans, 1,420 m are planned to be replaced or
strengthened to ensure the safety of train runs and to remove train speed
restrictions. The works comprise (i) replacement of 1,020 m wooden bridges
located on the Southern and Northeastern Lines with reinforced concrete
structure including piers and abutments, (ii) replacement of 200 m steel
bridges located on the Northern, Southern and Eastern Lines with new
girders imported from abroad, and (iii) strengthening of 200 m steel bridges
located on the Northern and Southern Lines by using structural steel materials
imported from abroad. The bridge loading standard for replacement or

Page 3
strengthening has been specified at the maxirum locomotive axle weight of
14 tons, the same as that of the 54 newly delivered locomotives, and the
bridge strengthening is to be carried out in accordance with this standard.
Procurement and Laying of Concrete Sleepers (1.5% of total expenditure)
9.        About 100 km of track length are planned to be laid with concrete
sleepers. The works comprise (i) 20 km on the Northern Line and (ii) 80
km on the Southern Line. While long welded rails were introduced into SRT
in 1948, concrete sleepers - which should be more suitable for long rails
than wooden sleepers - have only recently been introduced in Thailand and
are still in an experimental stage; they are locally manufactured but some
rail fastening accessories for them are imported from abroad. In the light
of exnerience, SRT hopes to be able to adopt a long-term policy of laying
concrete sleepers in conjunction with its program of laying long welded rails.
Signalling Equipment (1.2% of total exDenditure)
10.       SRT plans (i) the installation of interlocking devices between
signals and points at 38 stations (6 on the Northern Line., 25 on the
Southern line, 7 on the Northeastern Line), and (ii) the improvement of
the existing sianalling system at 51 stations (49 on the Northern Line,
2 on the Southern Line), with the object of improving safety of train
running and to meet the demands of increased traffic.
Replacement of Rails and Accessories (9.6% of total expenditure)
11.       In order to cope with increased traffic, to reduce maintenance
costs and at the same time provide the heavier trnck required by the new
1800 hp diesel locomotives, SRT plans (i) rail renewals of 312 km of track,
255 km on the Southern Line and 57 km on the Northeastern Line, where
60 lb/yd rails are still in use, and (ii) replacement of 274 sets of old
points and crossings, 140 sets on the Northern Line, 110 sets on the
Southern Line and 24 sets on the Northeastern Line, with new 80 lb/yd sets.
The rail renewals program covers replacement of existing rails with 80 lb/yd
rails, new wooden sleepers (175 km on the Southern Line, 57 km on the
Northeastern Line), concrete sleepers (80 km on the Southern Line, listed
separately), welding of rail joints and the additional provision of stone
ballast including the cleaning of existing ballast. Foreign exchange under
the rail renewals program includes 80 lb/yd rails, rail fastening, elastic
spikes for wooden sleepers and aluminothermic portions and equipment. Foreign
exchange for points and crossings includes 80 lb/yd rails and rail fastenings
only, from which SRT will manufacture the required equipment in its track
maintenance depot and install them at site.
Workshop Improvement (2.2% of total expenditure)
12.       This item comprises the modernization of facilities and procurement
of machinery for the Makkasan workshop, the Bang Sue diesel locomotive runnin g
shed and the Bangkok diesel railcar running shed.



ANNEX 5

Staff Ouarters and Office Buildings (3.2% of total exDenditure)
13.       This comprises the provision of additional living quarters and
office buildin 9 and replacing old ones.
Other Works (5.3% of total expenditure)
14.       This item consists of (i) acquisition and installation of lighting
equipment for 100 Passenger cars, (ii) installation of communication
equipment at station yards, (iii) extension of tokenless block working beyond
iakorn Sawan to Sila At on the Northern Line covering a distance of about
242 km, (iv) changing over to high tension electric power supply line
svstem and installation of new electrical ecuinment, (v) mechanized equip-
ment for track and bridge maintenance such as 100 sets of hand-held tamping
machines and one 20-m span temporary bridne for emergency use, (vi) acquisi-
tion of laboratory equipment such as one tensile strength testing machine
for steel, (vii) extension of track maintenance denot and acquisition of
various equipment, (viii) extension and construction of sidings at 45
stations, (ix) remodelling of three station yards to meet the increase in
traffic and acquisition of twqo specially designed shunting diesel locomotives,
exclusively for use in a new marshalling yard at Bang Sue, (x) setting up
fuel and service depots due to the increase in the ntmber of diesel
locomotives and diesel railcars, (xi) acquisition of water pumps for the
regional workshops, (xii) stabilizing of road bed and replacement of
50 lb/yd rails by 60 lb/yd released rails on the Maeklong Line, and
(xiii) miscellaneous works.

Changes in Train Operations and Increase in Train Capacities
As a Result of Procurement of 54 1800 hp Diesels
1.        The effect of the procurement of 54 1800 hp diesels, combined
with rescheduling of train operations on the Southern Line, on the SRT
operations may be summarized as follows:
(a)  The operation of 13.27 million train-kms will be affected;
this represents 49.3% of a total of 27.64 million train-
kms in 1971;
(b) steam traction will be reduced by 4.45 million train-kms
from 5.78 million in 1971 to 1.33 million, or by 76.9%;
in addition, steam shunting will be reduced by 0.79 million
loco-kms;
(c)  diesel traction will increase by 4.57 million train-kms,
from 19.73 million (excl. diesel railcars) in 1971 to
24.30 million, with a reduction of 3.99 million in the
operation of existing diesels and an increase of 8.56
million due to the procurement of the new 54 1800 hp
diesels;
(d)  dieselized train services will increase from 79.1% to
95.2% of the total including the operation of diesel rail-
cars; steam traction will be used mainly for a limited number
of mixed trains and shunting;
(e) the average annual train-kms will increase from 76,300 per
locomotive to 119,600 for those train operations affected
by the project; this net increase, however, takes account
of a decrease from 138,500 to 83,300 train-kms for the
existing diesel locomotives replaced by the new 1800 hp
diesels and utilized to haul trains previously operated
by steam. This decrease is, however, understandable if
compared with the 45,600 train-kms produced by the steam
locomotives to be replaced.
2.        The procurement of the 54 1800 hp diesels will result in the
following increases in the estimated train capacities.

FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Rescheduling of Train Operations
1.        The SRT staff prepared, and the General Manager of SRT approved,
in August 1972, a plan for rescheduling of train operations. This re-
scheduling was limited to the Southern main line, but could after being
approved by the Government, be extended to include other railway lines as
well. The proposal has been approved by the SRT's Board of Commissioners,
and submitted to the Ministry of Communications.
2.        An extract of the SRT proposal follows:
(1) Thonburi - Chumphon Section
a)   Mixed Trains Nos. 355/356 (Thonburi - Prachaub) and
361/362 (Petchaburi - Chumphon) will be merged into
one mixed train between Thonburi and Bang Saphan Yai.
At the same time Mixed Train Nos. 475/476 presently
operating between Chumphon and Thung Song will be run
between Bang Saphan Yai and Thung Song to connect with
the proposed Thonburi - Bang Saphan Yai train.
b)   A diesel railcar train Chumphon - Hua Hin will be
introduced and scheduled to connect the existing diesel
railcar train Nos. 169/70 (Thonburi - Hua Hin). This
will provide a better service in place of the withdrawn
Mixed Train No. 362 as well as a transit service between
Thonburi and Chumphon.
(2) Chumphon - Thung Song Section
a)   Mixed Trains Nos. 363/364 (Prachaub - Surat Thani) and
403/404 (Surat Thani - Kantang) will be terminated.
An ordinary passenger train running between Surat Thani -
Haad Yai wil be introduced to replace them.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
(3) Thung Song - Sungei Golok Section
a)   Mixed Trains Nos. 401/402 (Surat Thani - Pattahalung) and
413/414 (Pattahalung- Padang Besar) will be terminated
and replaced by a diesel railcar train operating between
Patthalung-Yala.
b)   An ordinary passenger train Nos. 133/136 presently
operating between Yala - Sungei Golok - Ru So - Sungei
Golok - Yala will be rescheduled to run two full trips
between Yala - Sungei Golok daily.
3.        These measures would result in the following changes in locomotive
costs for trains to be operated by diesel locomotives:
(a) At present 5 mixed trains are operated with 16 steam
locomotives. The annual operating costs are $ 14.84 million
with 1,064,000 train kilometers and an operating cost of
g 13.95 per steam locomotive train/kms.
(b) A total of 9 1800 hp diesel locomotives are estimated to be
required if these operations are dieselized without rescheduling.
This would result in annual locomotive operating costs of
$ 6.83 million 1/ which would imply a substantial saving com-
pared to $ 14.84 million, but no provision is made for annual
depreciation 2/ of some $ 11.5 million of the 9 diesel locomotives.
(c) The proposed rescheduling would mean that the 5 mixed trains
could be replaced by one passenger and two mixed trains, which
could be operated by only 5 1800 hp diesel locomotives. The
operating cost would in this case be % 4.99 million 3/ which
would result in a saving of total costs, even allowing for
annual depreciation, 2/ of $ 6.25 million.
4.        The foregoing calculations show that it is not feasible to
dieselize the present mixed train operations because the total costs would
increase because of high depreciation costs. A reduction in total costs
can only be obtained by a simultaneous rescheduling of train operations.
This result is considered to be applicable to SRT's mixed train operations
in general.
1/   f 6.42 per train-km x 1,064,000 train-kms.
2/   Investment cost $ 10 million per locomotive, economic life 25-30 years,
discount rate 12%.
3/   % 6.42 per train-km x 777,720 train-kms.

Utilization of Passenger and Freight Cars
1972-1974
1.   Passenger Cars
(a) Passenger-km in FY74 are expected to show the following
increases over FY72:
Class:  1st          2nd           3rd
+4.8%       -4.7%         +4.4%
(b) The average passenger car fleet in FY74 will show the following
changes compared with March 1972:
(No. seats in fleet)
1st           2nd          3rd
-6.8%        -0.4%        -1.1%
(c)  However, the present availability of passenger cars is a poor 83/%.
The substantial scrapping program, equivalent to 7,255 seats
scrapped by September 1974 (13% of the total fleet) should allow
an improvement to 87% in availability by September 1973 and to
90% by September 1974. In that case, the average number of seats
available in FY74 will increase as follows, compared with March
1972:
1st        2nd            3rd
-0.7%      +6.2,,        +5.4%
(d)  In 1971, the weighted average load factor was 73% on the ten
express and rapid trains, which are expected to carry the bulk
of the traffic increases to FY74. As an average, the load factor
is high and it will remain high in FY74. On this basis, the new
coaching stock procurement program does not appear to be too
ambitious.



ANNEX 10
Page 2
(e)  If the new passenger cars are not introduced, and there is con-
sequently no further scrapping of old cars, then it would be
realistic to assume a decrease in availability from 83% to 80%.
In such case, only 42,314 seats will be available by FY74 (all
classes) instead of 48,935 with the new stock (less cars scrapped),
a reduction of 13.5%.  It can reasonably be assume( tchat at
least the estimated increase in passenger traffic beLtween.
FY72 and FY74 would be lost.
Attachmnent 1 contains a summary of changes in passenrer car capacities anu
traffic.
2.   Freight-Oil Traffic
(a)  Ton-km are expected to be 9.5% higher in 1AY74 than in FY72.
(b)  The tank car fleet will show the following changes in FY74
compared with FY (March) 1972:
No. W'agons       Total Capacity          ACverae Capivt: 'Por ', aC-L
(Metric tons)
+9.32!            +13.9%               +b..9    (to 24.] tons)
Therefore, the planned capacity will increase much faster tlan oil traffic.
A comparison is shown in Attachment 2.
3.   Freight Other Than Oil
(a)  Ton-km are expected to be 10.4,' higher in 1-774 tiail  i  !n Y7Y2.
(b)  The wagon fleet in FY74 will compare with that as in ;iarcl-i
1972 as follows:

(Metric Tons)
+l., I4e, C); I                                 (,to 15 .'i  tor,}
Contrary to the oil tank wagons, the increase in capacity off fr ighL cars
other than oil will increase at a considerably lower rate thaii tlic traffic

ANNEX 10

(c)  In order to handle the expected freight traffic in FY74, thle
ton-kms performed per ton of available fleet capacity will
have to improve from 14,208 ton-km p.a. to 16,747 ton-km, i.e.
by 17.9%.
(d) This could be achieved partly by improving the availability of
freight cars from 86.6%'(1971) to 90% by FY74, improving the
14,208 ton-km to 14,732 (i.e. +3.7%). The remaining improvement
would have to come from a better turnaround time than that
achieved in 1971 (7.923 days). SRT considers a decrease to 7.0
days to be realistic which is acceptable. One reason given for
the poor turnaround time is the shortage of motive power,
especially on heavy-grade sections. This restraint will be
removed by the procurement of the 54 1800 hp diesel locomotives.
(e) The discrepancy between the abundance of oil tank capacity
and the shortage of other freight capacity will remain unchanged
by 1974. According to SPRT oil companies would like a faster
scrapping rate for the 140 4 wheel tank wagons. According
to the inventory, none of the tank wagons is more than 16 years
old but SRT maintains that this relates only to their chassis,
because these wagons represent World War II stock purchased from
India. Under these circumstances, the procurement program of
freight wagons is satisfactory and will not result in unjustified
increases in capacity.

Reduction in Operating Costs Resulting from Use
of 150 New Passenger and 470 Freight Cars
1.        The new rolling stock will result in cost reductions for the
following train operations:
(i) terminal service, freight traffic
(ii)  train formation passenger and freight traffic
(iii) repair and maintenance costs of passenger and freight cars
(iv)  in addition, there may be some savings to be obtained in line
haulage costs, but they are negligible compared to the above
three cost items.
2.        Terminal Services
(i) The savings in terminal service costs will result from use
of bogies instead of four-wheeled freight cars, which will
reduce the loading and unloading costs per train/km.  According
to SRT, the terminal service cost for one four-wheeled freight
car was $ 71.1 in 1970, with an average load of 10 tons and
a trip length of 400 km; this would imply a ton/km cost of
E 0.0178. The terminal service cost of one bogie freight car
was reported at % 98.4, which results in a ton/km cost of
$ 0.0103, with an average load of 24 tons and an unchanged
trip length. The savings resulting from the 470 freight cars
have on this basis been calculated to be:
470 (freight cars) x 0.9 (availability ratio) x 24 (tons per
loaded wagon) x 40,000 (km per year) x 0.0075 (difference
in ton-km cost, Baht) = % 3.05 million.
(ii) No cost reductions in terminal services have been estimated
to take place for passenger traffic.
3.        Train Formation
(i) Cost reductions in train formation result from improved
coupling mechanisms and use of bogies instead of four-
wheeled passenger and freight cars. The present operating



A_NEX I 1
Page 2
costs per unit of service are shown in Attachment 1 to
Annex 13. it is estimated that the new rolling stock will
affect the variable costs only, which are assumed to
decrease by 30%, resulting in following cost reductions:
(a)  per passenger car km                  g 0.007
(b)  per carload freight at terminal =  $ 5.003
(c)  per freight car km en route        =  $ 0.006
(ii)  The 150 passenger cars will produce 25.5 million carlkms
a year (170,000 km per car), resulting in a cost reduction
of $ 180,000.
(iii)  The 470 freight cars will produce 18.8 million car/km a
year (40,000 km per car), resulting in a cost reduction of
$ 110,000 in the en route train formation costs. The
reductions in terminal costs will be $ 210,000, with 100
loadings and unloadings per freight car per year (turnaround
time 7.0 days, availability 90%).
4.         Repair and Maintenance Costs
These costs are divided into shop and running cost components.
The former represents periodic repair and maintenance.
(i) Passenger Cars
(a)  According to SRT, the replacement of cars
exceeding 21 years in age will reduce the
annual shop repair and maintenance costs
from $ 72,500 per car to-$ 40,000. The
annual cost reduction for the 150 passenger
cars is thus calculated to be % 4.88 million.
(b)  The variable running repair and maintenance
costs are reported at % 0.0585 per car-km. It
is estimated that these costs will be reduced
by 35% due to use of the new rolling stock.
This will result in savings of $ 0.52 million
with 25.5 million passenger car-kmis.
(ii)  Freight Cars
(a) The annual shop repair and maintenance costs have
been reported by SRT to be % 7,600 for a four-
wheeled freight car exceeding 24 years in age,
while the corresponding cost for a new bogie



ANNEX 11
Page 3
freight car is %4,500. The cost reduction is thus
% 6,200 per new car, as it will replace in annual
performance two old ones. The cost reduction for
the 470 new freight cars is on this basis % 2.91
miUion.
(b) The variable running repair and maintenance
costs have been reported at E 0.0219 per freight
car-km at present. These costs will be reduced
ty 35%, which will result in an annual cost
saving of $145,000 for the 470 freight cars.
5.        Total Cost Reductions
(i)  Summarizing, the cost reductions have been calculated to:
(a)  terminal services                          g 3.05 million
(b)  train formation                              0.50 millioni
(c)  repair and maintenance costs               g S.46 million
Total                W12.01 million
(ii) These cost reductions relate to the year 1975. If old
rolling stock is not replaced, then the real costs are
estimated to increase by 4.0% annually resulting in a
similar increase in future benefits.

Cost Reductions Resulting from Improvement of Infrastructure,
Workshops and Operational Facilities
1.        The investment of $ 373.3 million in economic cost in these
improvements will affect the overall performance of the SRT, and is thus
not only related to specific operations as the procurement of the 54
1800 hp diesel locomotives and the manufacture of the 150 passenger and
470 freight cars.
2.        The investment will result in some cost reductions within all
main operational areas, but the effect will be a minor one for terminal
services and general administration, which have therefore been excluded
from the cost comparison. Similarly, the investment is not expected to
significantly reduce the fixed costs in depreciation of infrastructure,
workshops and rolling stock. Therefore, the cost reduction is limited to
the operating costs within the following main operational areas:
(i) train formation and shunting;
(ii) line haulage;
(iii) repair and maintenance of rolling stock;
(iv) roadway maintenance.
3.        According to SRT, the operating costs (excluding depreciation)
were for FY70 as follows:

ANNEX 12
Page 2
These costs represented 66.8h of the total expenses of SPRT in 1970 (% 826.95
million).
4.        The aforementioned total costs equate to % 0.054 per pass-kan
and % 0.144 per ton-km. It has been conservatively estimated that these
costs will be reduced by about 5% as a result of the % 373.3 million
investment. The operations particularly affected would be repair and
maintenance of locomotives and rolling stock, and roadway maintenance.
The total cost reduction will on this basis be $ 27.63 million. This
reduction in costs is estimated to increase by 4.0% annually due to
increased operating costs without the investment.

Marginal Costs of Increased Passenger and Freight Traffic
(Excluding Cost of Locomotive Operation)
1.        The marginal costs per unit of increased passenger and freight
traffic are presented in Attachment 1. These costs are applicable only to
the incremental traffic which can be accommodated by the increased train
capacities resulting from the use of the new 1800 hp diesel locomotives
and rolling stock (Annex 8). The marginal costs do not, therefore, include
depreciation on these components, while the operating costs of locomotives
have been included in calculation of savings from the locomotive procurement
program (Tables 13 and 14).
2.        The marginal costs for incremental traffic are as follows: 1/
(a)  per passenger car-km       -    j 0.57
(b)  per freight car-km        -    g 0.46
3.        The costs of increased traffic in Table 17 have been calculated as
follows:
(a) Marginal Cost Units
(i) 335 million pass-km corresponds approximately to:
- 1.0 million passengers (average trip length on
express and rapid trains 350 km).
6.5 million pass-car-km (average occupancy 50
per wagon on long-distance trains).
- 330 million gross ton km (1 passenger = 1 gross ton)
(ii) 96 million ton-km corresponds approximately to:
- 240,000 tons of cargo (average trip length 400 km).
- 4.0 million freight (bogie) car-km (average capacity
32 tons and load 24 tons).
- 10,000 bogie freight car loadings (average trip length
400 km, load 24 tons).
1/   Total marginal costs divided by passenger and freight car-km respectively.

- 200 bogie freight cars (turn-around time 7.5 days and
10,000 loadings per year).
- 190 million gross ton/km (1 net ton-km = 2 gross ton-kIn).
(b) Marginal Costs
(i)  Terminal Service
- Passenger service (1.0 million x $ 0.2890) = g 290,000
- Carload freight (10,000 x $ 30.5074)          = g 305,000
(ii) Train Formation and Shunting
- Passenger service (6.5 million x $ 0.0230) =   150,000
- Carload freight (10,000 x $ 16.6756)          = $ 165,000
(4.0 million x $ 0.0207)   = $  85,000
(iii)  Line Haulage
- Passenger service (6.5 million x $ 0.1204) =   780,000
Freight service (4.0 million x $ 0.0549)   = $ 220,000
(iv)  Provision of Rolling Stock (Repair and Maintenance)
- Pascenger cars (6.5 million x $ 0.1833)    =1,190,000
- Freight cars (4.0 million x % 0.753)          = $  300,000
(v)  Roadway Maintenance
- Track and roadway (5.2 million x % 0.3644) =1,895,000

Notes on 1972 Balance Sheet
Points Mentioned in Auditor's Report
1.   Special Deposits
These include Baht 29 million dating from 1951 and not recognized
by the Controller General. Efforts are being made by SRT to rectify this
difference or alternatively to obtain authority to write off against Government
Capital.
2.   Receivables include:
(a) approximately Baht 300,000 unaccounted for by station masters
and conductors. This matter is being investigated by SRT and
provision has been made to cover this loss;
(b) old debts due from Government (about Baht 39 million); and
(c) old debts due from State enterorises, (about Baht 22 million).
3.   Inventories
The auditors say the physical count did not cover all items.
4.   Other Deferred Charges include:
(a) an old balance from 1951 of Baht 0.7 million which is still to
be cleared with Controller General;
(b) an old balance of Baht 21.8 million, in respect of overspending
on capital works; SRT will attempt to clear this item at an
early date; and
(c) loss resulting from revaluation of Long Term Debt following
currency re-aligments, Baht 70.6 million.
Other Points
5.        Reports on inventory verification are at present made to Stores
Superintendent. This function should come under internal audit and reports
should be submitted to Financial Controller.

NOTES ON TABLE 9
THAILAND
STATE RAILWAY OF THAILAND
Notes on Forecast Revenue and Expenditure Accounts 1973-1977
1.        Figures for the year 1972 are provisional results for that year;
1973 figures are the budget figures.
2.        Provision has been made for annual increases in unit costs for
staff of 3% and2% for materials and fuel. Staff costs in year 1972 show an
increase of 8.7% compared with the previous year because it is intended to
re-classify permanent way labourers as permanent staff instead of temporary
staff.
3.        Operating revenue is based on rates and fares in force at
October 1, 1972.
4.        Loan Interest is calculated (a) on rates applicable to existing
loans, and (b) at IBRD rates on the proposed borrowing of Baht 1,265 million
(US$61 million equivalent) which includes the proposed loan of US$14.6 million.
5.        Future debt service has been calculated after taking account of
the February 1973 revaluation of currencies. The loss on revaluation of
outstanding debt which amounts to Baht 70 million will be transferred to
retained income account in preparing the 1973 accounts.
6.        The decrease in freight revenue in 1973 is caused by the
exclusion of revenue from special petroleum traffic which is considered
unlikely to continue.
7.        The forecasts do not take account of measures which SRI will be
required to adopt in order to comply with the earnings covenant (para 5.11).
Compliance with this agreement will mean that net revenue from operations in
FY 1977 should be about Baht 150 million.
