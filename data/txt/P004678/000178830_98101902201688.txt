ON A PRiOPOSED LOAN TO
TliE STATE RAILWAY OF THAILAND
FOPi A FOURTH RAILMAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the follo-wing repoit and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the State Tailway of Thailand (SRT)1/ with the guaranWee of the Kingdom of
Thailand for the eqtuivalent of US $15.0 million to help finance a fourth rail-
way project.    The loan would have a term of 20 years, including L years of
g-ace with interest at 7'^, % per annum.
PART I - THd3 ESONOMY
2.        A report on the economy of Thailand, based on the findings of a
mission -.hi.ch risited the country in September 1972, was distributed to the
Executi,ve  re.-;ors on March 9, 1573.  This updated the basic economic report
which was distributed to the   xcecutive Directors under co-ver of a niemorandun
from the Secretary (.-72-12 of January 18, 1972).   A summary of the mission's
findings and conclusions was .iven in nmy report on the Chao Phya Irrigation
Tmprovement Project which was distributed to Executive Directors under cover
of' a xnemoran-Jun from the Secretary (IDA/R73-25 of Yarch 22, 1973) and is
reproduced in Annex I, followring the Country Data.

PART III - TRANSPOPTATION IN TIIAILAND
l4.       The growth of the transportation sector in Thailand to meet the needs
of the rapidly developing Thai economy over the last ten years has been impres-
sive.   The pattern of expansion has been dictated by the dominant position of
Bangkok, Thailand's principal port and business center, and the need to link
1/ The official abbreviation is ESR which is used in the loan documents.



Bangkok to the outlying regions.    To accommod.ate the flow of goods and people
between Bangkok and the rest of the country, several systems have evolved with
Bangkok at the cente r.  There are about 10,400 km of naticnal highways, 5,900
km of provincial (feeder) roads and about 35,000 km of local roads.    The rail-
ways consist of about 3,830 km of meter gauge track.,   The waterways incllude
about ..AC0 lar of canals and rivers navigable in the wet season and about 1,100
km in the dry season.   Don Muang, Bangkok's airport, handled about 1.5 million
international and domestic passenger movenrents in 1970, of which about 1.2
million w,ere international traffic.   Domestic aviat,ion is not yet an important
carrier of freight or passen2gers.  The port at Bangkok handles about 80. of
Thailand's international se3 traffic and abolu+t 4` of its coastal traffic while
several minor ports serve mainly the needs of the Southern region.
5.   .    .2>oad freig-ht traffic increased by about 15';L9  a year from over 1,000
million ton-kn in 1960 to 3,900 million ton-'cm in 1970 (short hauls in 1970 are
estimated at 3,000 million ton-km).   Railroad carload fTeight has grown at an
average of 6.9' a year rising from 1,100 million ton-kma in 1960 to 2,300 million
ton-kmn in 1971. During the period 1961-1970 the motor vehicle fleet grew at
an average annual rate of l9v and about 738,0(0 vehicles were registered in the
country in 1970.    During this period the railways began a modernization progra
and nearly 5(f of the railwTays is now dieselized.
6.        wor the mostf part the system has de-reloped along rational lines and no
sig,ni ficant misallocation of transport investments has so far occurred.  Hiowever,
in vie., of the very rapid growth of the transportation system it is not sur-
prising, that a number of transport problems have developed.   In the first place
the -rapid growth of Bangkok and its central location in the system. has created
serious traffic rongestion in the clty and the movement of heavy trucks in
Bangkok during daylights hours has been restricted.    Solutions to this problem
are being, sought.  A two-phase -U-ban Transport Study, financed Twith the assis-
tance of t-he Federal F'enu'olic of Germany, beg,an in 1971.  The first phase which
is nearlv completed lwill seek short-term solutions to relieving triffic congestion
while the second phase, due to be com.pleted in 1974, wrill recommend a long-
term program for providing adequate transport in the city including possibly a
rapil transit syStem.   Another aspect of this problem is the need to divert
pap-t of tihe traffic to a second and deep water port.  A study, financed with
the help of the Netherlands, was recently completed on the feasibility of
developincg a port at Laem Kr,abang,f, about 120 l-, southeast of Ban,kok.  This
study ha.s been complemented by a study, financed with help frcn IJSAID and
completed early this year, on converting Sattahip, an existing military
port about 50 km further south of Laem Krab.ang, for civilian traffic. A
United Kingdom-7ir.-.ncCd study is also examiningn the possibilities for contain-
erized caaoes.    A second p-oblem concerns road-rail coordination. ;W-ith the
development of the highways, road transport has bec^ome the predominanu mode for
freight transport, replacing the railw:ays.  However, it is probable that some
uneconomic diversion of trafi'ic has taken place, and the railways are now in a
better position to concentrate on increasina the efficiency of their long-haul
operations and are taking steps to modernize their equipment, improve their
scheduling and adjust ta,iffs to meet the challenge of road transport. The
level of road user charges is being studied as part of the highway maintenance



-3-
study financed out- of Loan 870-Ti and it has been agreed with the Governnent
that on the completion of this study in 1971t the Government will review its
policies regulatin- road/rail coordination in the light of the findings of
the study.   Finally, it appears that the possibilities offered by the rater-
4rays network for low-cost transport have been neglected.  4hether improving
navi-atioim on the waterwviays would be justified depends on a comparison of the
benefits from irrigation, navigation, power, industry, etc.       The need
for a comprehensive study of this nmatter is being discussed with the
Government.
7.        Government investment in transport during the Third Five-Year Plan
(1972-176) is estimated at about Bt 21 billion, or about 20% of development
expenditures.   Roads are planned to absorb about St 16.6 billion, railways
Bt 2.5 billion writh the balance about evenly divided between inland waterways
and ports and civil aviation.    The largest increase in the Third Five-Year
Plan  is for investment in provincial roads.    The greater emphasis on
provincial roads is well justified in view,' of Thailand's need to expand and
diversify agricultural production for export, but the transport investment
plan as a whole is being revised to reflect more closely economic priorities
and a more realistic schedule for project preparation.    Hnowrever, if full
benefits of constructing new provincial roads are to be achieved, a consider-
able effort w.rill be required to improve inter-sectoral planning.  F.ecent
oroanizational changes in the Government hold out promise that improvements in
planning may be possible.    The main departments concerned with agriculturAl
planning and project implementation have been brought under the Ministry of
Agriculture and C'ooperatives and the Department of Highways has been moved in tc
the Ministry of Communications, bringing all modes of transport except constrfla.--
tion and maintenance of inland waterways under the Ministry's direction.    Tthe
Plinistry of Communications also intends to implement the principal recommenda-
tions on organization and planning of the Transportation Sector Review carriel
out last year by the B.ank.   A transportation policy and planning committee an..
a transportation planning unit will be set up.    These changes should help
improve sector plannincg and invrestment decisions as well..as inter-modal
coordinati on.
The S tate Railway of Thail and
8.        SPT operates over a 3,830 route-km meter gauge system which radiates
from Bangkok.   The principal lines are to Chiengmai in the North (750 km) and
to Malaysia in the South (1100 Ion).   Less important lines extend to the
Northeast and East to the borders of Laos and the Khmer Republic. Some sections
of line and some bridges need strengthening or replacing.     SRT motive power
and rolling st.ock comprise some 231 main line steam locomotives, 191 diesel
locomotives, 985 passenger cars, 9178 freight cars and 45 diesel railcars.and
trailers.   SRT operates a central workshop which carries out heavy repair
work and manufactures rolling stock, and three reg .ionalr workshops.
9.        In the 1960's car-load (CL) net ton-km increased from 1.1 billion
to 2.3 billion, a growth rate of 6.9% per annum;   passenger traffic increased



from 2.3 billion to h.3 billion passenger-Ion, a growth rate of 5.8'O per annum.
Less than-carload (L&L) traffic has steadily declined.    The railway has lost
local and LOL traffic to road transpo-rt but has demonstrated some success in
exploitin, its advantages for long, distance passenger, bulk and unit load
LreiEht traffic.   Seven. coimodities accounted for 61.5% of the total freight
traffic in 1967 and 73.8% in 1971.   SRT forecast that this development will
continue during 1972-1977.   The overall annual growvth rate for Freight is
forecast at 3.9' in ton-km reflecting the slower growth of the economy in the
l970's with the seven commodities increasing their relative share to 77.6C by
1977.   ST?T assumes it will continue to lose 1,L,L and general cargo traffic to
the highways.   SRT1 expects passenger traffic over distances less than 300 km
to remain constant due to road competition while long distance traffic, re-
piresenting i1 .5* of the total in 1971 will increase by 5.6% and total passenger
traffic by 2.5'.   These forecasts have been reviewed in conjunction with
STT's futu-e investmnents and are considered realistic.
10.       SilT was established as a sepa-ate legal entity in 1951.  A Board
of Commissioners, appointed by the Council of pIinisters, is entrusted with
the formulation of policy.   The General lManager, who is appointed by the
Board, subject to the approval of the Council of I'`inisters, is responsible for
SFT's operations and administration.    SfuT staff are trained at the RaillwJav
Trainin,   en-ter in Thailand and selected senior officials receive additional
t,raininga abroald.  The management of SRT is w-ell qualified and competent.

11.        k report entitled "Thailand - Appraisal orf Fourth Failway P-oject" (Nc.
6!la-T1T  dated April 5, 19°73) is being circul,ted separately to the EPxecutive
Directors.   A loan and project summqa 'y is provided in Annex III.
Envestment r Pecuirer-ents
1FST has prepared a hroad Investment Program Ifor 19'73-15)76 desiizne(,i
to complete dieselization, to expand the rollin, stock fleet to mee-t expected
traffic increases, to strengthen track and bridges and to modernize 3PT's work-
shops.   The Pro-ram would enable -3ST to improve ope-ating efficiency and main-
tain a solund financial position.   The Program as presented to the appraisal
mission (did not, ho-ver, include proposals to reshape the operations of the
r'T, nor did it propose measurec to take advantage of the technical advances
embodied in the Prog-ran. Iio ad`-ustment to train schedules to maximize the
,grreater efficiency of diesels had been proposed and no chan-es in the level
of rates and fares to reflect the costs of railway services and the demand for
them had been made.  'The mission reviewjed the Invesitnent P o,gram with 'T
and as a result substantial revisions ;ere rnade and a satisfactory first stage
and a tentative second altaue were established.  The revised Investment Proqram is
estimated to cost Pt 2.251 million (US i;108 million eauivalent).



1?.       Before decidin7 on the final size and composition of the second
stage of its progrmn, SST will prepare a comprehensive plan covering all aspects
of dieselization, including reschedulina of services, identification and costing
of uneconomic services, the expansioh of marketing and coimnercial activities
and a revie-.,- of costs. and tariffs.  The plan would be completed by September
197b.- The '3ove-rnment has undertaken to authorize the implementation of a corr.-
prehensive plan agreed 7,rith SRT and the Bank by Mla-ch 31, 1975.  The Government
has also agreed to compensate SRT for any financial losses due to operating
uneconomic services if the Government decides that the service should continue.
'The Project
1h.       The project is the first stage of SRT's 1973-1976 Investment Program.
It would be the fourth railway project to be financed with the help of a Bank
loan.   The three earlier loans to ST were made in 1°50, 1955 and 1961;    the
first two were completed satisfactorily wvhile the third was delayed about two
years due mainly to cumbersome tender approval procedures.    The project was
proposed for Bank financing in the course of the Bank's review of Thailand's
Third Five-Year Plan in July/August 1971.   The appraisal of the project began
in June 1972 and was completed in November 1972.   The proposed loan was
negotiated in Washington from March 19 to Ilarch 26, 1973.  The Government
delegation was led by H.E. Ambassador Anand Panyarachun assisted by Mr. Ahna
T:msyananda, General Manager of SRT.
15.       The project comprises the folloving main items:
a)  Procurement of 54 x 1800 hp diesel locomotives;
b)  Procurement of about 30 hopper cars;
c)  Components for the manufacture by V.T's workshops of
about 150 passenger cars and 470 freight cars;
d) Track and bridge strengthening works including procure-
ment of rails;
e) Rxpansion and modernization of workshops and station yard
remodelling;
f) Procurement of concrete sleepers and signalling equipment;
g) Staff quarters, office building and other works; and
h) Studies of investrnent programn and operations.
Items b), c) and d) are the principal ones to be financed ;'rith the
assistance of the proposed loan: details are shown in Annex III. Item a) is
to be financed from bilatera.l French credits (see beloil).
l('.      Ou-ing S7T's 1967-1971 investment program, SPT twice called for
tenders for the procurement of the 54 diesel locomotives on the basis of cash
and credit offers but because of complicated evaluation procedures was unable
to reach a decision or obtain the Government's approval of an award before
the validity of bids had expired.  Because of these difficulties and SRT's
urgent need to continue its dieseli7ation proaram the Government decided it
would be advisable to ask foo bids on a cash basis only and requested the
Bank in September 1971 to consider financing the eventual contract. W4e agreed
to dlo so but suggested that after international competitive bidding and
evaluation of bids in accordance with the Bank's procurement procedures, the



-6-
GIovernment could, if it wished, approach the succe3sful supplie- or tile Gov-rn-
ment concerned to determine whethe r financing on terms more favorable than a
Bank loan was available. To assist SRT in the bid evalua-tion the Bank requested
STvT to employ expert assistance.  In our review of SBRT s bid evaluation and
r ecomrme nd ation,which incor-porated the views of the expert, it, became apparent
that the Bank would be unable to agree with SDT on the lovest evaluated bid.
After consulting the Bank in November 1972 the Government of Thailand withdrew
its request that the proposed loan include financing for the diesel locomotives.
Tn December 1972 S2T awarded a contract to Alsthom of' France.
17.        Responsibility for the execution of the project rests u¢ith SRIT which
has succe,sfully carried out similar projects;   42 of the new diesels will be
used to replace 46 existing srnaller diesels (which will in turn replace 7P ste nm
locomotives an(d Davenport diesels), 10 wirill replace 25 stearri locomotives and
2 will be used for a new express train.   The 30 hopper cars oill help make
track maintenance work more efficient and the passenger anLd frei-ht cars are
required as replacements and to provide additional capacity.  'T rack and
bridge strengthening is required to handle the heavier diesels, to ensure the
safety of trains and to renove train speed restrictions.   &xpansion and
mode-nization of workshops are requi-red as a result of the replacement of steaml
by diesel traction.   SBT plans to obtain the ser-vices of a specialist to help
prepare its comprehensive plan. The project is expected to be completed by
September 19 76.
Cost S.stiriates
18.        The estimated cost of the project (incluaing import duties) is
1369.3 million;  the estimated for-eign exchange component is *44t7.2 million.
Cost estimates for the d.iesel locomotives and spares are based on the agreed
contract betw,reen SHT and Alsthom;  provision for price escalation on other
iteirs has been made on the basis of a 5% annual increase in fo-rei7n costs and
3" in local costs.   Detailed4 cost estimates ar e provided in Aniax III.
Financing Plan
19.        The project would be financed from the folIlowing soulces:
(US.S equivalent)    _
(millions)

-7-
20.       The Credit Tlational loan and the French Bank credit, totalling $29.0
million equivalent, will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of the
5L diesel locomotives and spare parts.    The Credit National loan has a term of
25 years, including 10 years of grace at an interest rate of 3.5% and the French
Bank credit has a term of 10 yea-s at 7.23$.    The Credit National loan is already
effective and the French Banks 'Iedit Agreement will be rade effective prior to,
or simultaneouslN,y with, the proposed Bank loan.
21.       The overall terms of the financin- plan are appropriate and the
jovernment has undertaken to cover any financing gap.
SRT Financial Situation
22.       SRT's financial situation has been deteriorating over recent years.
Net income, after loan charges, has declined from Bt 167 million in 1967 to
Bt 73 million in 1972 and a deficit of Bt 61 million is forecast for 1977.
Between 1967 -and 1972 the operating ratio increased from 79 to 89 and the
return on net fixed assets fell from 3.o6, to 1.8SS.  The forecast for 1977
shows a further increase in the operating ratio to 95.6 and a decline in the
rate of return to less -than l$.   This situation has developed due to increased
operating costs, mainly wag,e increases, which were not offset by higher revenues
although staff productivity has improved substantially.    There has been no
general increase in rates and fares for 16 years.
23.       Clearly the situation outlined above would be unsatisfactory, and
following discussions during negotiations it was agreed that from October 1,
1973, SRT will maintain a rate of return not lower than 2% on net fixed assets.
Moreover, in viev of the increased use of debt financing SBT also agreed to
maintain debt service coverage of 1.5 on all long-term borrowing.     The
achievement of these targets should ensure SMT's financial viability and ,would
enable 31.T to contribute about 55 toward the cost of future investment prograrms
after 1977.   The means available to SFT to correct their financial situation
and to implement the requirements of the earnings covenant include the early
introduction of selective tariff adjustments, and the closure of uneconomic
branch lines and stations, or the provision of Government -ompensation to cover
the costs of operating these services.
Procurement and Disbursement
2h.       All enuipment and supplies to be financed by the proposed loan aiill
be procured through international competitive bidding.    The passenger and freight
cars will be manufactured in SF3T's central workshops from imported components.
The major part of station yard remodelling, bridge and rail strengthening,
sleeper replacement, workshop improvements and installation of sigialling
equipment will be carried out by SRT.    A small amount of track equipment may
be suitable for bidding by local suppliers in which case a preference of up
to 150 or the applicable custcms duty, whichever is lower, would be applied -to
bids from local manufacturers.    Disbursements under the loan are set out in



Annex III and will be made for the cif costs of imported equipment and supplies,
or the ex-factory costs of locally manufact-ured items, and for the foreign
exchange costs of the specialistst services.
Benefits
25.       The project is designed to meet the essential renewal requirements
of the railway in ordei to rnaintain its competitive position with other modes
by improved opetational efficiency and modernization.   This will allow the
railway to perform its proper economic role.   The increased capacity resulting
from the project is estinated to produce annual benefits to the economy of Bt
5L million represen'bing savin-s in transport costs, compared with the alternative
carrier, road transport.   The estimated annual savrings in operating and main-
tenance costs is  estiLated to result in annual benefits of Bt 76 million.   The
project as a w.hole has an economic r-ate of return of 13';,, which is satisfactory.

THE ECONOMY
/Tx-tract from the President's Report on the Chao Phya Irrigation Imp- ovement
Project distributed to xcecutive Directors under cover of a NIemorandum from
the Secreta-y (IDA/R73-25' of March 22, 1973.7.
1.        When Thailand's Third Plan (1972-76) began in Octobei 1971, the rate
of economic growth had slowed from the average of 8 percent a year in the 1960's
to around 6 percent.   The balance of payments which had been in surplus was in
deficit and -there was concern that the capacit,y to finance irnports would become
a constraint on future expansion.   Since then exports have risen steeply and
this has triggered an economic recovery.   Exports of goods and non-factor set-
vices increased by 10 percent in 1971 and 29 percent in 1972.   At the same
time imports grew slowly- this combination reduced the external resource defic.
and raised foreign exchange reserves.   However, much of the improvement in thee
balance of paynents has been due to factors that may not recur, such as abrupt
shifts in external demand fop some of Thailand's main exports (rice, kenaf and
sugar) and the revival of services to the US military since mid-1971.
2.        Government spending and investment by state enterprises have continued
to rise more rapidly than GDP, thus sustaining the gro-vith of the economy.
However, despite rising tax revenues, the current surplus of the "entral
Governmen-t has diminished because of even more rapid increases in current.
spending on secu-ity, education and debt service.   The Government will have
to reverse the declining trend of its current surplus, to generate enougjh
resources for its prograrn of capital expenditure.
Development Policies and Problems
3.        The development objectives of the Third Five-Year Plan, which was
reviewed in detail in the basic economic report are:  first, the revival of the
economic gro7wth at or near 7 percent a year while maintainin- price and externsl
stability;   second, the expansion of agricultural and in(dustrial export c3pa-
bilities supported by effective export promotion programs;   third, a larger
share of the public development effort for agriculture, educatian and other
programs of social imp-vovement;  fourth, a betler regional distribution of
development gains with concern for the Northeast;   fifth, programs to develop
institutions designed to channel official exteinal capital into private sector
investment as a means of improving external debt management;  and sixth
improvemnents in Thailand's economic management, particularly in the formulation
of pr,ojects and regional programs.
1L.       In 1972, the Government began to introduce the improvements in
economic management, development policies and project preparation which are
called for in the Plan.   Perhaps the most important improvements concern
economic managemeuit; an administrative reorganization was effected in October
1972 with the aim of improving the administration and coordination of economic
and social services, and -wias accompanied by strengthening of staff in such
ministries as agriculture, industry and commerce.   The reorganization was

followed by Cabinet appointments under- an, interim Constitution prormulgated
in December 1972.   The regrouping of all agricultural services in one ministry
-hould make it easier in future to formulate and implement agricultu-al policies
and prograrls.  The same applies 'to trade promotion, transport and commiunications.
'3owever, further effortl;  a-re needed to turn the3e reforms at the top into lasting
improvements at the departmental and local levels.    The Government, in addition,
introduced legislation and policy changes to facilitate the expansion of manu-
facturing, particularly for export, and to improve the functioning of the capital
market.   FinallY, progress was made in project preparation and the Plan pro-ran
of external borrowing is on schedule.
The r;overnmert is allocating more resouj;ces to agricultu-e and its
services dealin;, with the secto, have just been reorganized;  policy-makin- and
the dissemination of new knowledge are expected to improve as a result. T.hree
main obstacles to the expansion of agricultural production for export exist
and require government action if the ambitious Third Plan Larget for a 30
percent increase in agricultural exports is to be achieved.    The first is the
price of fertilizer to the farmer which is kept high by import restrictions
designed to protect high-cost domestic production.    The second is a premium
charted on rice exports, which had been eliminated in A'pril 1971 but was
reimposed in September, 1972 because of a steep increase in rice pr,-ices.  The
p emium depresses the price paid to the farmer and should be lifted when external
demiand conditions warrant it.  The third obstacle to expansion consists of
unsatisfacto,y institutional arrangements for credit, extension services, land
tenure and land settlement.
6.        In manufactu.ring, expo-t p-ospetcrs look mole cpo±nising.  Fiscal
incentives to exportws have been introduced and are beina used.   An indus-trial
estates authority has been estc.blished recently and duty-free zones for export
may also be established soon.    The-e is room for further improvements in
i,overnment support for private industrialists, bu-t even so it is expected that
the amibitious Plan targets for the export of manufactures will be exceeded.
7.        In the area of financial mana,gement, there is a need to expand domestic
'inari al instituti ons which would mobilize long-term savinas domestically anrd
abbroad fI-o the financing of private investhnent.  'Fhe Government has alread,
introduced chanoges in taxation and regulations that will help contractual
savings institutions to expand.   A start has also been made in strengthening
institutions speciFlizing -in the financing of agriculture, sm'll industries
and residenti-l construction which could help raise the level of investment in
these sectors by offering more suitable terms and services to borrowers.
There is also a need for the Government to continue encoura-ing the expansion
of domestic institutions wThich borrow on favorable terms from official sources
o-F external can i tal for anlendin; to private investors to 'inance equipment
imports.   These institutions in part replace foreign suppliers' credit and
thlus help -educe the growth of Thailand's external debt service liabilities.
i3.       Ihe Gxove'n,rLent's population policy aims at reducin, population growth
tc2 ^.5 percen-t by 1';76, and the dissemination of mode:rn birth control techimques
has maqde quick progress;  buvt this is a recent development and Thailand will
havre to contend with a rapid increase in the working-age population until the



Page 5 0  8 p
mid-1980's.   Unemployment is frictional and seasonal at present, since Thailand
still has virgin land which is being opened up by many who would otherwise be
unemployed.   Most new entrants to the labor force become farmers because of the
limnited job opportunities in other sectors.   However, the supply of cultivable
land may be exhausted as early as the 1980's and it is thevefore essen-tial to
implement policies to increase farm employment per unit of land against this
eventuality.   These include measures to raise crop yields, expand irrigation,
and promote other farm activities (livestock,fishinc, silk, et..).
9.        Differences in income between urban and rural families a-e large and
tend to widen.   Ho,ever, the Drogress made by rural families during the 1960's
was quite considerable. The policies prescribed for agriculture would make
fo- a more equal distribution of income between town and country.  The outlying
regions, which are predominantly agricultural, have lagged behind the BarzkoK
area an development and income growth.    Government programs dealing with the
special problemrs of the less developed regions are furthest advanced in the
Northeast and are under preparation for the North and the South.
The Outlook in 1973
10.       The recovery, which began in 1072 as a result of the steep rise in
export earnings, is expected to gain further momentiLn in 1973.  Wdith anticipates
ancreases in private investment and consLumer deirnd. import grow-th shoul6 be
At the same time, howeve-, exports will probably stagnate because a drought ih i
the sunimer of 1°72 has reduced the availability of rice, kenaf and especiall
maize for export.   The resource gap will therefore begin to widen again, b t
an increased inflow of long-term private and public capital is expected 5o
prevent a significant loss of reserves.
Third Plan Prospects
11.       The recent imnprovement in Thailand's economic situation and the outlol>
for 1973 indicate that the Third Plan target for real GDP growth of 7 percen. _
year during 1972-76 is realistic, while ioreign exchang,e reserves will probably
stay above the Plan forecast.    However, the depressive effect that the 1973
setback in agricultural output and exports may exercise on subsequent economic
expansion points to the need for a nore active development policy during the
remrainder of the Plan period.   Policies and programs designed to promote
production for ekport should receive first priority, considering the imLportaLnce
of exports as a determinant of GDP and private investment growth and the tren^s
in the balance of payments.
12.       The deficit on goods and non-factor services will increase.    (2ommoiidtY
exports will start rising again after 1973, and the anticipated rapid growth of
tourist receipts should make up for possible declines in receipts fror, the U-S
military which are a major source of uncertainty.    However, the growth of
imrports which depends la-gely on the saving effort, the growth of investment
and the speed at which import substitution is promoted, is expected to lead to
a current account deficit of nearly $1.3 billion in 1973-76.



ANNEX I
Page 6 of 8 pages
13.       To finance this deficit, an increase in external capital inflows is
needed and the Governmenbts policy is to rely more heavily than in the past on
public, as opposed to priva-te, extei'nal bormrwin7.  The Third Plan target of
about 't900 million in ne, commitments of official loans during 1572-76 was
a^cepted as a reasonable estimate of Thailand's requirements by the last mee1ing
of t,he Consultative Group for Thailand.  This target iTnplies a major effort
in prolect preparation, which the Governnment has begun to make with help fiom
bilateral aid scurces and our ;FeFional Mission.   It is also Government's policy to
naintain the private sector's freedom of access to private credit sources abroad
and in consequence private capital inflows are expected to rise for financing private
equipment imports.   Since reserves are still at a hig,h level and there is a need
to facilitate private investment, this policy appearas appropriate at this juncture.
Fowever, in o-ier tc prevent an excessive Tise in private external borrow-ing on
hard be-rs. it is imDortant that; the Goverrnment continue to promote the use of
official credit lines by domestic financial institutions for- financing, an incr easing
share of private eouipment imports.    Icxternal public and private borrowincg during
the Third Plan are expected to cause debt service to rise to 19.2 percent of
exports by 1976.   This Twrould be a heavy but manageable burden on the balance
cf payv e nts.  Foreign exchans7ge reserves are projected -to decline from $969
miLlion at the end of 1972 to about 4t750 million by the end of 1976, w^hich would
represent about f'our months of -oods and non-factor services impoorts at that, time.
lit.      .ey,on l',76, howrever, if' the predicted trends in exports, imports and
c--pital inflo-,s continue, rese-ves would decline further and the growth of
Thailand's debt service burden would become a serious problem for the balance
of penent.s.   The bu:rden of debt, service could be mitigated by a further
increase in the share of official capital in total external borrowings, and
by an acceleration of export grow-th over and abovTe the :r.te assumned for the
Thir(i Plan period.   There is li.ttle doubt that the former could be achieved,
but a Lurther acceleration of exports woulu depend on both Thailand's own efforts
and exte.nal factors.   If thiF accele-atiun coula not be realized, the country
would face the prospect of a rather heavy debt burden in the 1980ts and the Govern-
ment n.iaht be for(ned in the late lq7O's to slowvi dovn the economy, unless it were
able to obtain more of its public borrowings on significantly improved terms.   Thus,
Thailand's long.-term debt prospects are sufficiently difficult to justify some
financinn; on concessional tenns.    In view of this the members of the Qonnultative
Group have agreed to a substantial improvement in the terms of their capital
assistance to Tha-land.

BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THAILAND
/Updated extract from the President's YReport on the Chao Phya Irrigation
Improvement Project distributed to Executive Directors under cover of a
Memorandum from the Secretary (IDA/i1473-2) of March 22, 1973).7
1.         Since 1950 Thailand has received 26 Bank loans amounting to
$464.6 million, net of cancellations. Most of these have been for trans-
portation ($179.1 million), irrigation ($69.2 million) and power ($91 million".
with, in addition, one for a dual-purpose power and irrigation project ($65 9
million). The remaining loans have been made for education ($21.4 million),
industry ($1.0 million) and telecommunications ($37 million). A credit of
$19.5 million for the Third Education Project was approved by Executive
Directors on March 13, 1973. In general, Bank-financed projects have been
carried out in accordance with expectations. Construction of the Third
Bangkok Port project, financed under Loan 702-TH, began 18 months behind
schedule. The delay was mainly caused by the time taken by the Port Author_ty
of Thailand and its consultants to pre-qualify bidders, amend tender documents
and evaluate bids which were complicated by currency realignments.
2.         For the next few years, about half the Bankts lending program for
Thailand will be directed to projects in transport, power, water supply and
communications. Irrigation development will also be a major feature. But
projects in education, family planning, agricultural credit, industry and
tourism will broaden the spectrum of the program although they will account
for lesser amounts. Both Bank and IDA projects are increasingly selected
to achieve a wider geographical spread for development benefits. One of the
main functions of the Regional Mission recently established in Bangkok is to
assist the Government in developing projects which will contribute to this.
The Bank's readiness to finance some local costs in appropriate cases will
enable it to participate more fully in base-level projects in agriculture
and the social sector, A Consultative Group for Thailand, which is
chaired by the Bank, met last in February 1972 and will meet again in May
1973.
3.         During the balance of the current fiscal year, I expect to present
for your consideration a loan of about $55 million for the Bangkok water
supply project for which the Asian Development Bank is also considering a
loan of about $20 million. A Northeast crop improvement project, the Phit-
sanulok irrigation project, and the multi-purpose Quae Yai project, all of
which are being appraised, should be ready for your consideration in 1974.
Other projects under consideration for vy74 include seed multiplication,
industrial finance, industrial estates, port development and urban infra-
structure in northeast Thailand. The Government of Japan, which in April
1972 signed a Y64 billion equivalent credit agreement with the Government
of Thailand, has expressed an interest in participating in the financing of
the Phitsanulok irrigation project and the Quae Yai project. This should
be facilitated by the decision recently announced by the Japanese Government

that it will fully untie loans extended to Thailand for development projects.
Other lenders to Thailand are planning to increase their commitments under
the Third Plan.
4.         On Deceimber 31, 1972 Bank loans disbursed and outstanding to
Thailand amounted to $196 million, representing 22 percent of the country's
total external debt of $893 million. The level o1' Bank/IDA commitments is
expected to increase substantially over the next five years, but loans and
credits disbursed and outstanding are not expected to exceed 30 percent of
the projected external debt by 1978.
5.         Prospects for IFC operations in Thailand look reasonably good
and investments in a pulp project and aluminium sheet and foil manufacturing
are under consideration.
