Bank having been cleared no later than De ember 31,2007; Management will inform the
Board by this date regarding the status of      ears clearance. This approval would require
an exception to OP 13.40 (Suspension o Disbursements) which provides that no new
grants be presented to the Board for appr val when a member country is in non-accrual
status. The exceptionis sought to addresst e requirement of the bridge lender to effect an
intra-daytransaction,which requires the m ximum amount of time within that day for the
process to be undertaken successfully. I m satisfied that the proposed grant complies
with the Articles of Agreement of the As ociation, and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.

6.9     Grant amount,conditions and tr nching; exception to OperationalPolicy
13.40 (Suspensionof Disbursements). Th recipient is the Republic of Liberia,
representedby the Ministry of Finance. Th grant is for US$430 million equivalent.
Board discussion of this grant is contingen upon confirmation from the International

Monetary Fund and the African DevelopmentBank that a satisfactoryprogram for arrears
clearance (including obtaining financing assurances)has been agreed with each of these
two institutions and that neither institution foresees obstaclesto Liberian entry into the
HIPC Initiative. Board approval is being sought conditional on arrears to the Bank having
been cleared no later than December 31,2007;Management will inform the Board by
this date regarding the status of arrears clearance. This approvalwould require an
exception to OP 13.40(Suspension of Disbursements)which provides that no new grants
be presented to the Board for approval when a member country is in non-accrual status.
The exception is sought to address the requirement of the bridge lender to effect an intra-
day transaction, which requires the maximum amount of time within that day for the
process to be undertaken successfully. The Grant will be released in one tranche
following its approval and notification by the Association of effectiveness of the
Financing Agreement.

                 REENGAGEMENTAND REFORMSUPPORT PROGRAM


                            GRANT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY


Recipient:              Republic o f Liberia
Implementing            The Ministry o fFinance
Agency:
Amount:                 SDR [263.1] million (US$[416.4] millionequivalent)'
Terms:                  IDA Grant
Objective and           The objectives o f the proposed grant for a Reengagement and Reform
Description:            Support Program (RRSP) are to: (i)facilitate the clearance o f Liberia's
                        arrears to IBRD and IDA, which i s required in order to restore normal
                        relations between Liberia and the World Bank; and (ii)support the
                        Government's efforts to establish a rigorous fiscal underpinning for the
                        Liberian economy that will permit accelerated recovery and growth. The
                        Grant would support key measures in the government's strategy, including
                        to: (i)stabilize the fiscal situation, (ii)improve fiscal management, and (iii)
                        accomplishboth o f these objectives in a new regime o f public transparency
                        concerning both revenues and expenditures. This strategy would lead over
                        time to strengthened fiscal sustainability, improved economic governance,
                        and enhanced transparency o f State institutions andprocesses.
                        At the request o f the authorities, the proceeds o f the grant would be
                        disbursed for direct reimbursement o f a bridge loan o f US$[407.4] million
                        extended to clear Liberia's arrears to IBRD (US$[332.3] million) and IDA
                        (US$[55.7] million), and immediate budgeted fiscal needs including future
                        debt service obligations. The grant would assist the Republic o f Liberia in
                        its economic and social recovery underpinned by the government's Interim
                        Poverty Reduction Strategy. This one-tranche operation would support
                        government-owned reforms to improve the country's fiduciary environment
                        and strengthen public institutions. It i s an integral part o f the Bank's Interim
                        Strategy Note for Liberia for the period 2007-2008.

Disbursement:           The proposed grant would be disbursed in one tranche, immediately
                        following effectiveness o f the FinancingAgreement.
Benefits:               Normalization o f relations with the World Bank would (i)          set the stage for
                        the provision o f regular IDA resources; (ii)       facilitate Liberia's efforts to
                        reestablish relations with the rest o f the international community, including
                        both other creditors and donor agencies; and (iii)      pave the way for Liberia
                        to access debt relief under the HIPC and MDRI initiatives. It i s expected
                        that this will lead to an increase in the level o f support for social and
                        economic development activities in Liberia, which in turn i s expected to
                        help improve a fragile security situation and ease tensions inthe region. It i s
                        also expected that normalizationand access to new resources and debt relief

1The precise amount o f the arrears to IBRDand that o f the bridge loan financing arrears clearance will be
calculated according to currency exchange rates before the meeting o f the Board.

               would help stimulate private sector investment inLiberia.
               Inaddition, the proposed grant would support reformmeasures expected to
               have a positive impact on poverty reduction. Specifically, the strengthening
               o f public financial management would enhance efficiency, transparency and
               accountability in public resource use, and increase the country's absorption
               capacity for external resources. The proposed grant would also help fund
               the provision o f basic public services with a high beneficial impact on the
               poor in the period immediately after arrears clearance. IDA support in the
               form o f this operation would have an important signaling role and serve as a
               catalyst for other donors to increase and accelerate their support to Liberia.
Risks:         The proposed program i s o f medium risk. The five principal risks are: (i)
               security risk, if violence within the sub-region reignites conflict within
               Liberia; (ii)political risk, arising from the broad range o f interests
               represented by the opposition-led legislature; (iii)macroeconomic risk,
               resulting from a government failure to adhere to a responsible medium-term
               macroeconomic framework, which in turn could result in a relapse into
               arrears; (iv) fiduciary risk arising from failure to suppress corruption or
               failure o f the government to make effective and efficient use o f the fiscal
               space made available by arrears clearance and budget support; and (v)
               implementationrisk,due to a very limitedimplementationcapacity.
               While mitigation o f the security risk falls outside o f the scope o f this
               operation, it i s expected that other development partners will remain closely
               involved in this area. Political risk would be mitigated by broad-based and
               frequent consultations with stakeholders to strengthen the case for reforms
               and Government's commitment to them. The macroeconomic risk would be
               mitigated by close economic monitoring and coordination by the Bank, the
               IMF and other donors, increased access to donor and other resources
               following arrears clearance,       and an acceleration, if warranted by
               performance, o f the HPC timetable. Fiduciary risk would be mitigated
               through the combination o f the GEMAP, a PEMFAR, further technical
               assistance and capacity building. Finally, implementation risk i s being
               addressed by various capacity building efforts, including an active training
               program financed by the Bank and other partners.

                                 REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
               REENGAGEMENT AND REFORM SUPPORT PROGRAM

                     1.     INTRODUCTIONAND BACKGROUND

1.1     This program document proposes a Reengagement and Reform Support Program
(RRSP) Grant to the Republic o f Liberia in the amount o f SDR[263.1] million (US$[416.4]
million equivalent). This RRSP supports the full normalization o f relations between Liberia
andthe World Bank and the Government's efforts to establish a rigorous fiscal underpinning
for the Liberian economy that will permit accelerated recovery and growth inthe context o f a
multi-donor reengagement process. The proceeds o f the grant will be disbursed (i)  to support
cash flow needs in the period immediately after Liberia has cleared its arrears to IBRD and
IDA, and (ii)to meet immediate budgeted fiscal needs including future debt service
obligations.
1.2     The grant would assist the Republic o f Liberia in its economic and social recovery
underpinned by the government's Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy. This one-tranche
operation would support government-owned reforms to improve the country's fiduciary
environment and strengthen public institutions. It is an integral part o f the Bank's Interim
Strategy Note (ISN) for Liberia for the period 2007-2008.* Specifically, the key objectives o f
the RRSP are to support the government's efforts to establish firmly the fiscal underpinnings
for recovery and for the provision o f essential public services. It supports key measures
undertaken to: (i)stabilize the fiscal situation, (ii) improve fiscal management, and (iii)
accomplish both o f these objectives in a new regime o f public transparency concerning both
revenues and expenditures. This strategy would lead over time to strengthened fiscal
sustainability, improved economic governance, and enhanced transparency o f State
institutions and processes. It will also pave the way for HIPC debt relief with attainment o f
the HIPC DecisionPoint (DP).
1.3     Liberia has undergone profound changes in the past four years. The Accra
Comprehensive Peace Agreement o f August 2003, UN Security Council Resolutions 1509
and 1521, and the collaborative work between the transitional government and donors that
followed built a path to the legislative and presidential elections o f October-November 2005
that were generally considered peaceful, free and fair. An elected government headed by
Ellen Johnson Sirleaf assumed office on January 16, 2006. More than 100,000 combatants
have been demobilized and reinserted into society, and most o f the one-third o f the
population that hadbeen displaced has returnedto its place o f origin.
1.4     Although Liberia i s one o f the poorest countries in the world today, a third o f a
century ago it had a per capita GDP comparable to those o f Egypt, Indonesia, and the
Philippines and more than double that o f India. Inkeeping with lending norms o f the 1970s
and early 1 9 8 0 ~Liberia received IBRD loans carrying a fixed interest rate in several
                    ~
currencies: principally Deutschemarks (now Euros), Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, and U S
Dollars. The weighted average interest rate on the outstanding portfolio i s 8.7 percent. All
IBRDloans and IDAcreditswere placedinnon-accrualstatus inJune 1987.

1.5       Liberia's arrears to the World Bank total US$[388.0] million3 (IBRD US$[332.3]
million, IDA US$[55.7] milli~n).~            A comprehensive arrears clearance planthat encompasses
the World Bank, the African Development Bank Group (AfDB), and the IMF has been
agreed with the Liberian government. A critical element o f this plan i s the track record o f
satisfactory performance that Liberia has built over the last 22 months. The clearance o f
arrears to preferred creditors provides a critical element o f progress towards: (i)a HIPC
Decision Point that would trigger interim debt relief; and (ii)              further debt relief at the HIPC
Completion Point (CP) under both the HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI)'.
1.6       In terms of IDA resources, Liberia meets the eligibility criteria that have been
discussed with Executive Directors for exceptional arrears clearance support from IDA.6
Since Liberia i s at high risk o f debt distress, IDA resources are provided on grant terms, per
the stipulations o f the grant allocation system agreed with IDA donors for the IDA 14 period
(FY06-FY08). Liberia is also eligible for annual exceptional post-conflict allocations from
IDA.


          2.        LIBERIA'S DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGE AND PROSPECTS


                       A.        POLITICAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUND

2.1       Political situation. The origins o f the Liberian conflict rest in the exclusion and
marginalization o f much o f its population, which have characterized Liberia for most o f its
existence as a country. At the sociopolitical level, poor governance and constrained
integration have been critical problems. The founding constitution hadbeen designed to meet
the needs o f the settler population who subjugated the indigenous people. Political power was
concentrated essentially in Monrovia and primarily at the Presidency. Land and property
rights o fthe majority o fLiberianswere severely limited.

2.2       Buoyed by President William Tubman's Open Door Policy and Unification Program
o f 1944, Liberia's economy posted an annual growth rate o f 4 to 7 percent that persisted
through the 1960s. The foundation o f this economic growth was a policy regime granting
concessions for the exploitation o f iron ore, rubber, and timber. Foreign direct investment

 As of October 31, 2007. IBRD interest accrues at approximately US$1.5 million per month; amounts due to
IDA accrue at US$325,000 permonth.
 Liberianauthorities have authorized the Bank to implement the Bank's revisedpolicy on overdue interest
charges principal payments. Thls reduced Liberia's arrears by about US$121.5 million (See Review oflnterest
Charges on OverduePrincipal Payments of Fixed Rate Loans and Special Treatmentfor Countries with Fixed
Rate Loans Presently in Non-Accrual R2007-0136/1, dated July 9,2007).
 IDA andthe AfDF will bothdeliver MDRIto Liberiaupon its Completion Point. As o fNovember 15, a
decision is still pending from the IMF on whether it will amend its policies regarding its deliveryo fMDRIto
allow it to provide MDRIrelief on the post-cutoff PRGF/EFF debt that will be incurred by Liberia to the IMF
for the purposes o f clearing its pre-cutoff arrears to the IMF.
6At informal meetings onNovember 28,2006 andFebruary 8,2007, the Executive Directors expressedsupport
for an approach to clearing Liberia's arrears to IBRD and IDA that relied on an exceptional allocation o f IDA
resources. A systematic approach to arrears clearance was M e r discussed by the Executive Directors on June
20, 2007. This approach was also discussed and endorsed by the IDA deputies on June 30, 2007. See IDA 15
policy paper "Further Elaborationo f a Systematic Approach to Arrears Clearance", June 2007.

increased significantly with the establishment o f mining concessions and the expansion o f
rubber plantations. With the prices o f iron ore and rubber high on the world market, Liberia
experienced a period o f economic boom. The boom, however, primarily benefited an elite
group, while the investments expanding physical and social infrastructure during the period
excluded rural areas.

2.3     Marginalization, gross mismanagement, and perceived inequalities in the distribution
o f benefits from national resources, together with the dependence of the nation on a small
range of natural resources, sowed the seeds for the 1980 coup andthe violent 14-year conflict
that began in 1989. Moreover, the coup coincided with a fall in the terms o f trade, which,
together with a decline in capital investment, precipitated a sharp decline o f the economy.
The GDP growth rate fell from 5 percent inthe early 1970s to less than 1percent inthe mid-
1980s, andthen GDP collapsedby 90 percent between 1989 and 1994.

2.4      By the late 1980s, arbitrary rule and economic collapse culminated incivil war, with
the militia o f Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front o f Liberia eventually seizing the
capital in 1990. Taylor's victory did not end the conflict, as fighting intensified with the
rebels splintering andbattling each other, the Liberian army, and West African peacekeepers.
Around 250,000 people were killed in Liberia's civil war and about a third o f the total
population was displaced by the fighting. The conflict left the country overrun with weapons
and in economic ruin, with the country's endowment in roads, railroads, electricity
generation and transmission (including overtopping that led to catastrophic erosion o f the
country's earthen hydroelectric dam), potable water and sewage utterly destroyed. A 1995
peace agreement led to the election o f Mr. Taylor as president in 1997. However, fighting
broke out again in 1999. As Taylor backed civil conflicts in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and later
in C8te d'hoire, in July 2003 the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) imposed
sanctions on the export o f diamonds and timber, revenues from which were being used to
finance arms andfuel regional conflict.

2.5     After over twenty years o f instability, the Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement o f
2003 ushered in a political transition. That transition, from August 2003 to January 2006
under a National Transitional Government (NTGL), mirrored several o fthe elements ofpoor
governance and economic under-performance that had paralyzed the nation under earlier
political regimes. Despite its failures, the major achievement o f the transition was its
successhl exercise o f legislative and presidential elections that were regarded to be free and
fair in November 2005 and the inauguration o f Africa's first democratically elected woman
President, EllenJohnson Sirleaf, on January 16,2006.

2.6     Security. The security sector in Liberia had long been dyshnctional, unprofessional,
lacking in accountability and corrupt. Security forces terrorized the population and
intervened in the political realm without respect for due process. Militias from neighboring
countries intervened inLiberia, and the Taylor government supported conflict inneighboring
countries. The 15,000-person UN military presence (UNMIL)' has established security
throughout the country. Ex-combatants have been demobilized and reintegrated. Around 75

percent o f the almost 10,000 Special Security Services personnel have been deactivated. The
UNand the U.S. are providing training ofpolice officers for a new non-politicized Liberian
national police force. Aside from some resurgence in street crime, the situation has become
calm, and personal security has encouraged the return o f expatriates and the launch o f
businesses and economic activity. However, insecurity inneighboring countries continues to
threaten the Liberian economy.

2.7      Economic Growth and Inflation. Over a quarter o f a century o f conflict and
economic mismanagement, Liberia's real GDP per capita declined from US$1,269 in 1980 to
US$163 in 2005.8 Well over three-quarters o f its people now live below the poverty line o f
US$1 per day; about half live in abject poverty with less than 50 cents per day. An
overwhelming majority o f Liberia's people are unemployed or employed in the informal
sector as a result o f the shrinkage o f the formal sector, the effects o f the war, and the UNSC
 sanction^.^   Inaddition to the destruction or dilapidation of physical infrastructure from the
conflict, the delivery o f basic services such as health and education has been disrupted.
National and local institutions are dysfunctional. The result has been poor governance and
widespread corruption.

2.8      Since 2005 the economy has made a strong recovery, driven by agricultural revival as
displaced households return, the high level o f spending by UNMIL and international
partners, and strong growth inservices (mostly construction). Real GDP growth is estimated
to have increased from 5.3 percent in 2005 to 7.8 percent in2006. Inflation has been held to
single digits. The broad economic outlook for 2007 points to an acceleration o f the growth
rate to over 9 percent and 11percent inflation (see Table 2.2).

2.9      Trade. Total exports in 1978 o f about US$486 million declined to about US$104
million in 2004. The trade balance, which had increased from a surplus o f about US$5.5
million in 1978 to a US$212 million surplus in 1989, declined to a deficit o f US$325.5
million by 2004. This was largely due to the decline o f the mining sector which dropped
from 12 percent o f GDP in 1988 to 0.08 percent in2004 on account o f the persistent conflict,
specifically the destruction o f iron ore mining and transport infrastructure and the UNSC
sanctions." The trade balance has continued to decline since 2004, despite much improved
terms o f trade. Exports have remained low, largely due to the sanctions; though rubber export
revenues have increased strongly since 2004, this i s due to strong world prices offsetting the
declining production o f aging rubber trees. Imports have been bolstered by the economic
recovery and donor activity. The overall current account deficit (including grants) i s
estimated to have increased from 9 percent o f GDP in2005 to 27 percent in 2007. Liberia's
trade regime i s relatively open. Import tariff and export tax rates currently in effect are



8 2005 prices.
  Timber sanctions are reported to have cost 25,000 jobs and diamond sanctions another 12,000 jobs, according
to the Liberia Federationo f Trade Unions.
10 The UNSC lifted sanctions on timber in June 2006 and on diamonds inMarch 2007. Making permanent the
former depends uponputting into place laws that will guarantee the scrupulous granting o f concession rights to
ensure that timber revenue accruing to the government benefits the population through the provisionofjobs and
basic social services inthe areas of operation; the latter upon Liberia implementing the Kimberly Process. The
first consignment o fKimberly-compliant diamonds was exported inSeptember 2007.

modest. The new administration is seeking to harmonize Liberia's trade regime with that o f
ECOWAS; it i s also seeking fast-track membership to the WTO.

2.10    Fiscal Balance. Revenue mobilization declined precipitously with the collapse in
economic activity coupled with the prevalence o f rent-seeking behavior in the customs and
revenue administrations. While the NTGL oversaw important steps toward elections and
return o f the rule o f law, and under its program with the IMF the Government maintained a
balanced cash-based budget, different political factions each had been given control o f
particular Ministries and State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) under the Peace Accord, and fiscal
performance was dominated by rent-seeking. In FY04/05 government revenues were only
US$80 million. The Government accumulated significant arrears under the NTGL, primarily
to civil servants and suppliers, while funds were divertedby high-level authorities, including
members o f the Cash Management Committee (CMC). External arrears continued-and
continue-to accumulate as Liberia has repaid none of its external debts beyond token
payments that do not stabilize arrears to the IMF, the World Bank and the AfDB.

2.11    Under the SMP agreed with the IMF, the new Government developed a balanced
cash-based budget for FY06/07 and successfully repeated the exercise for FY07/08 except
for modifications made by the legislature. The Government increased revenues by 16 percent
in just its first five months in office, and revenue collection increased by 74 percent in
FY06/07 compared with FY05/06. This increase was due to strong economic activity and
improved tax administration. Both taxes on income and profits and international trade have
contributed to the strong revenue performance. Expenditures at times lagged behind the pace
o f revenue collection in FY06/07, and for the year as a whole were only US$330,000, or
0.2%, below projections. This was an improvement over FY05/06, during which spending
was 0.9% below revenue projections. Nonetheless, spending was uneven, with spending
significantly higher in the last quarter o f FY06/07. It i s expected that a combination of
improved procurement and expenditure systems as well as training supported by the Bank
andothers will leadto more even spending inFY07/08. The legislature voted increases inthe
allocation for a community development hnd and for an increase inthe civil service pay that
exceeded the administration's budgeted increase. As the amended budget was approved by a
majority sufficient to override any veto, this budget was signed into law. Together, these
effectively exhausted the surpluses accrued largely through the increased revenue collection
(revenue outpaced projections by nearly 10 percent inFY06/07). The revenue expected to be
collected includes the proceeds from the one-off iron mining concession payment negotiated
from Arcelor-Mittal NV.l1

2.12    External Debt and Debt Sustainability. Liberia's external debt burden rose from
US$750 million in 1979to US$1.4 billion in 1985. Since then, arrears on external debt have
progressively accumulated to over US$2.8 billion by 1998. By 2007, total external debt,
including capitalized interest and penalties, exceeded US$4.6 billion (Table 2.1 and Annex
9).'* Most debt records were destroyed duringthe conflict, with multiple lootings and fires at

11The government budget posted inthis document excludes these modifications which have not yet been
executed.
'*These data are based o n a provisionaldraft o f the HIPC Debt Sustainability Analysis; numbers, particularly
concerning commercial debt, are still being reconciled. Annex 9 (2006 data) does not include the re-pricing of
IBRDinterest arrears described infootnote 4.

the Ministry o f Finance (MOF). International financial advisors financed by the Swiss
Government have been attempting to reconcile external commercial debt. While the veracity
o f creditors' records can be relied upon to help the authorities reconstitute multilateral and,
with more difficulty, bilateral debt, the advisors have had great difficulty assembling records
o f commercial debt, which is so far imprecisely knownbut i s estimated at US$1.1-1.6 billion.
O f that total, about 75 percent corresponds to syndicated loans that date back to the early
1980s, the remainder corresponds to trade-related obligations. Much commercial debt i s
understood to no longer be owned by the original creditors, with secondary creditors believed
to have purchased a significant proportion o f it. After both sides exchange more detailed
information, the government plans to begin good-faith negotiations with the creditors in the
coming months.

2.13    Liberia i s inarrears with nearly all its creditors. External debt is very large andclearly
unsustainable. Estimates based on incomplete data compiled for a draft HIPC Preliminary
Document indicate that at mid-2006 the country's ratio o f NPV o f external debt-to-exports
was 1,967 percent and that o f debt-to-GDP 263 percent. Debt service due in 2007 i s 16
percent o f GDP (Table 2.2). To address its external debt problem, Liberia will need to
demonstrate a continued strong commitment to sound macroeconomic and structuralpolicies,
but will also require substantial support, including exceptionally deep debt relief from the
international community.

2.14    Several aspects set Liberia apart from previous HIPC cases:

    e   The size o f arrears (and debt) is exceptionally large relative to Liberia's population
        (3.3 million) and GDP (US$500 million).

    e   Clearing Liberia's arrears would result ina marked increase indebt service payments.
        The resulting increase could be attenuated by a combination o f concessional arrears
        clearance, swift access to debt relief (under the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI) and
        additional resource transfers.

        Reducing Liberia's debt inthe context o f the HIPC Initiative i s expected to entail one
        o fthe highest common reduction factors so far.


                                                6

         Multilateral creditors could deliver a significant proportion o f their share o f HIPC
         Initiative debt relief through the clearance o f arrears, limitingtheir capacity to reduce
         Liberia's future debt service payments, inparticular duringthe HIPC interimperiod.

    0    Commercial creditors represent about 18 percent o f Liberia's external debt in NPV
         terms after full delivery o f traditional debt reliefmechanisms.13 Inaddition, non-Paris
         Club bilateral creditors represent about 2 percent.
2.15     In June 2007, the Government met with representatives of its major commercial
creditors at a meeting hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank o fNew York to resume a dialogue
after 25 years, and to establish a process and timetable. The representative o f the Federal
Reserve encouraged creditors in strong terms to collaborate with the Government. In the
meeting, Government indicated that in approaching the resolution o f its commercial debt
problem, it will (i)seek a comprehensive solution to its commercial debt problem, (ii)
address all creditors-bilateral        and commercial-on         the basis o f comparable treatment, (iii)
conduct itself in a transparent and cooperative manner, (iv) abide by the procedures
established under the HIPC Initiative, and (v) adhere to the policies regarding the use o f
funds o f donors that will support the resolution o f Liberia's commercial debt. After both
sides exchange more detailed information, the government plans to begin good-faith
negotiations with the creditors inthe coming months.

13Liberia's commercial debt i s unusually large compared with earlier HIPC cases. In part, this i s because
Liberia's middle-income country status inthe 1980s allowed it to borrow commercially more readily than other
HIPC countries. Liberia's 25 years of civil conflict and arrears to IBRD/IDAmeant that it i s not one o f the 17
current HIPC countries which benefited from a pre-HIPC decision point debt buyback supported by the IDA
Debt ReductionFacility.

2.16    Domestic Debt. The preliminary results o f independent attempts to verify domestic
debt and arrears have revealed (in January 2007) outstanding claims o f US$914 million. Of
this amount, US$304 millionis considered valid, while the remainder is tentatively classified
as either "contestable" or "rejected". One-third o f this debt i s to the Central Bank o f Liberia
(CBL) and commercial banks, although there are also significant arrears on payments to
suppliers for goods and works. The level o f domestic debt is o f particular concern following
the destruction o f most debt records during the conflict, as the integrity of the counterparty's
records i s less certain than for international debt. The Government retained external auditors
to verify large domestic obligations (92.3 percent o f the preliminary total), while the 7.3
percent representing small claims were investigated by an inter-agency vetting committee. A
resolution strategy for domestic debt has been developedthat aims to settle salary arrears and
the bulk o f vendor arrears before end-2008. The Government proposes to repay salary arrears
and supplier credits under US$l,OOO in full (excluding interest) and with a sliding scale for
the rest so that the largest claims receive only 15 percent o f the credit, with all classes o f
creditors, whether domestic or external, treated comparably, and with any outstanding tax
obligations settled before payment. The government began implementing the strategy and
settling supplier arrears in2007.

2.17    Debt Management.Prolonged civil conflict inLiberia disrupted the capacity o f the
institutions that are responsible for debt management. The accumulation o f arrears curtailed
Liberia's access to new financing and such financing is available only inthe form o f grants.
These events have weakened debt management processes with the loss o f much institutional
capacity and the breakdown o f established procedures andpractices. Debt management is the
responsibility o f the MOF and the CBL. The existing legislation does not clearly specify the
responsibilities o f each institution. The Debt Management Unit o f the MOF i s the main
source o f public debt statistics. Despite plans to obtain specialized software, the government
continues to store its debt data in various Excel spreadsheets. The lack o f a reliable debt
recording system and a comprehensive public debt database severely limits the government's
capacity to generate reliable statistics. Also, there are no standard procedures to monitor and
record incoming data and no explicit access controls or data back-up procedures for data
records. Debt management software and training is being provided by the World Bank and
the AfDB. Historical debt records are being compiled, consolidated and brought up to date
with the assistance o fthe IMF, the World Bank and assistance financedby Switzerland.

2.18    Governance. Given its poor overall governance environment and lack o f capacity,
the government's faces enormous challenges in improving its procedures for fiscal
management and transparency. Many civil servants recruited in the past two decades, and a
large share o f the staffs o f the SOEs, have been unqualified, poorly educated, patronage
appointees. l4In response to malfeasance and poor public financial management uncovered
by partners under the NTGL, in September 2005 the international partners and the NTGL
signed the Governance and Economic Management Assistance Program (GEMAP).




l4A number of skilled, underpaid civil servants who remained helpedexpose the corruption of the NTGL and
previous administrations to the outside world, andnow carry a heavy workload inthe new administration.


                                                    8

2.19    GEMAP is a direct response to the concerns o f Government and partners about the
mismanagement o f public resources in the post-conflict transition and the threat it
represented to the peace process. The Security Council welcomed the GEMAP inResolution
1626 o f September 19, 2005. The President endorsed GEMAP in her inaugural address and
has supported it strongly. An Economic Governance Steering Committee (EGSC) chaired by
the President and comprised o f key ministers, the CBL, international partners and civil
society oversees the implementation o f GEMAP. GEMAP has six components: (i)             securing
Liberia's revenue base; (ii)improving budgeting and expenditure management; (iii)
improving procurement practices and grantingo f concessions; (iv) establishing processes to
control corruption; (v) supporting institutions o f government that are key to promoting and
sustaining accountable government and good financial management; and (vi) capacity
building. The government has set out a bold program to strengthen the fiscal framework by
improving fiscal management, and the transparency o f revenues and expenditures, among
other measures as detailed insection 3.

2.20    However, immense challenges remain in instituting transparent, accountable
government. Procurement, despite the passage o f a new procurement law reflecting
international best practices, remains a serious problemand a source o f rent-seeking behavior.
Capacity building, already difficult because o f the low level o f staff education and training,
has been further hampered by the need to develop and institutionalize adequate new control
andmonitoring systems inthe chaino fexpenditures.

                      B.       MACROECONOMIC       AND FISCALOUTLOOK

2.21    As Liberia emerges from years o f conflict, the macroeconomic framework will be
subject to significant uncertainty about the economy's potential output as well as incomplete
information on the cost o f the Government's poverty reduction policies. Poor quality data
result from boththe destruction o f statistical capability inLiberia, as well as the obsolescence
o f baseline surveys-more     than a quarter o f a century old in an environment where much
productive capacity has been destroyed-with       which changes in economic magnitudes are
weighted. Most Liberian data are infact obtained from international agencies, rather than the
reverse. This was foreseen in the World Bank's Operational Policy 8.60 on Development
Policy Operations, which notes that "countries affected by crisis or conflict may require an
unusually quick response from the Bank. There may not be sufficient time or country
capacity to adequately address design considerations (such as possible distributional effects,
effects on natural resources and the environment, fiduciary arrangements), or a strong policy
program developed with stakeholder consultation." The Bank, together with other donors i s
actively helping to restore capacity inthe Liberian Institute o f Statistics and Geo-Information
Services (LISGIS) and other statistics-producing institutions to redress this shortcoming (also
see para. 3.22).

2.22    More significantly for a macroeconomic framework, however, UN and donor
disbursements to Liberia have increased sharply since the 2003 peace agreement to an
estimated US$300 million in 2006 and are projected to continue at a similar pace in 2007.
This figure, more thanhalfo f GDP, is exogenous to the macro-economy and by any measure
greatly exceeds the endogenous determinants o f economic growth. These donor funds are



                                               9

spent outside the state budget and include not just transfers to Liberia but also significant
technical assistance components that may be macro-economically neutral.

2.23    Inthe context of the government discussions with the Ih4F for a Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF), a tentative baseline macroeconomic scenario has been
developed which builds on prudent macroeconomic and reform policies and effective
implementation of the GEMAP to help lay an early foundation for strong and sustainable
growth. These policies are expected to trigger significant hrther financial and technical
support from donors. The early establishment o f an environment conducive to private
investment and the lifting o f UNSC sanctions on timber and diamond exports could
potentially attract large flows o f foreign direct investment (FDI), which could lead to an
average growth rate o f about 12 percent during 2008-2010 (see Table 2.2). Under this
framework, average inflation i s expected to increase from 7.2 percent in2006 to 11.4 percent
in2007 andthen decline to 7 percent by 2010. The trade deficit isprojectedto increase from
29 percent o f GDP in2006 to 39 percent in2008 and to then decline to 28 percent in2010.

2.24    Onthe fiscal side, the FY07/08 budget, which was submitted to the legislature inMay
2007, targets an increase inrevenue o f 25 percent. DuringFY07/08-FY09/10 the government
i s projected to continue to maintain a balanced budget (on a cash basis), though the
amendment to the FY07/08 budget by the legislature demonstrates that the administration
cannot be certain that its projections will be maintained. Revenues are expected to increase
from 15 percent o f GDP inFY05/06 to 25 percent inFY09/10 as a result o f improvements in
tax and customs administration and a continued pick up in economic activity. On the
expenditure side, current expenditure i s projected to increase from 9.9 percent o f GDP in
FY05/06 to 24 percent in FY09/10. Under its cash-based budget, the Government has
maintained fiscal balance and, because o f delays in reparing and processing expenditure
requests, slightly under-spent its budget in FY05/06.        15Salaries   and wages, which accounted
for approximately one-half o f expenditures under the NTGL, will represent well under 50
percent, even after a pay increase (that was hrther increased by the legislature during the
approval process) that is intended to help motivate a very poorly paid civil service, with a
large portion o f the balance going to clearance o f government arrears (largely unpaid salaries
and payments to suppliers from the previous administrations) and programs that directly
assist the population. Capital expenditure i s projected to be inthe range o f 2.5-3.5 percent o f
GDP duringthe period, andto be financed bydonors.

2.25    Giventhat it will take some time for Liberia to regain access to financial markets, the
Government will need to pursue a balanced cash-based budget for the foreseeable future. To
this end, development assistance through the budget will contribute significantly to the
Government's ability to deliver services. In anticipation o f receiving budget support from
IDA under this grant, the Government intends to prepare a supplemental budget for FY07/08
that reflects the support financed from this program to finance additional vital activities,
including the salary reform component o f a civil service reform, and specific measures to
improve financial controls within the Ministry o f Finance and line Ministries. These

l5Timely budget executionremains a weak   link inthe implementationphase of fiscal reforms. Measuresunder
the proposed program are expected to improve cash management capability within the line ministries. However,
inFY 06/07 the government chose to reallocate its spending withinthe great flexibility granted itbythe budget
law, demonstrating continued problems inother stages o fbudget execution.


                                                  10

activities are not possible within the current budget. Regardingpublic financial management,
important steps have been taken to implement a set o f controls for budget commitments,
which are essential for improving budget implementation and increasing donor confidence.
Nevertheless, further steps-and         more thorough implementation o f steps already initiated-
are required to improve fiduciary systems.

2.26     Access to HIPC debt relief. Liberia is heavily indebted and its debt situation is
complicated by the large stock o f arrears, including to the World Bank and IMF, the high
share o f commercial debt, and the poor state o f loan records following decades o f
destruction. Access to debt relief under the HIPC and MDRI initiatives i s a critical
component o f the government's strategy. Already, as required under the HIPC Initiative
framework, Liberia has established a strong track record o f reform that meets the
requirements for attainment o f the DP. Once arrears to the preferred creditors have been
cleared, it i s therefore expected that Liberia will proceed quickly to the HIPC Decision Point,
at which point interim HIPC debt relief will begin. While interim relief will reduce the
amount due to creditors, Liberia's debt service will nonetheless increase significantly.
Liberia expects to finance debt service due during the interim period through grants. It i s
expected that all preferred creditors will provide strong positive flows to Liberia during the
interim period. Furthermore, all Liberia's o f remaining debt to preferred creditors qualifies
for full cancellation under the MDFU once Liberia reaches the HIPC Completion Point,
which i s currently expected by end-2009.

2.27     Liberia's low level o f income, very highlevel o f indebtedness and lack o f capacity to
mobilize domestic resources means that Liberia will not be able to contribute resources to the
clearance o f its arrears with IBRD and IDA. For this reason, an exceptional arrears clearance
allocation i s requiredto finance the full amount o f Liberia's arrears to IBRD and IDA.I6

                                  Box 2.1: Debt to the World Bank

  IBRD arrears at November 15, 2007 were US$332.28 million. The maturity date on all IBRD loans has
  already been reached. Consequently there are no current debt service payments due to IBRD in 2007 and
  all obligations to IBRD will be eliminated once arrears have been cleared. Following arrears clearance,
  Liberia will resume debt service to IDA. Liberia's obligation to IDA, excluding arrears, stood at US$75
  million at end FY07. Because the arrears clearance operation will deliver the entirety o f the World Bank's
  share o f HIPC relief, no interimrelief can be provided and debt service payments to IDA will amount to
  US$325,000 per month on average after arrears are cleared. The proposedgrant includes financing to cover
  foreign exchange requirements, from which the government could choose to service debt to IDA during the
  period 2007-2009.

3.1       Dueto civil war andpoor governance, Liberiahadnever developeda strategy focused
on poverty reduction. In its I-PRSP,I7 which was discussed by the IMF and World Bank
Boards in May 2007, the Government presents creative strategies and innovative programs
for re-launching growth and improving governance. This ambitious document represents the
Government's desire, finding permitted, to address rapidly the most serious development
issues.




l7Republic o f Liberia, "Breaking with the Past: from Conflict to Development: Interim Poverty Reduction
Strategy" (January 2007), p. ii.


                                                    12

3.2    The President's Forewordto the I-PRSP states the challenge clearly:

       "The inauguration o f the Government on January 16, 2006 following national
       elections in 2005 was a watershed in the history of Liberia. The elections symbolized
       the people's desire for peace, reconciliation, stability and development. They also
       served as a wake up call to break fiom past government misrule, violence,
       divisiveness, human rights abuses and economic mismanagement, all o f which
       shattered the lives o f Liberians. Expressing their collective will through national
       elections, Liberians articulated their desire to rebuild a new Liberian nation that i s
       peaceful, secure, prosperous, inclusive, and provides economic opportunities to the
       benefit o f all. ...
       "At the core o f these challenges is poverty. ,.. w ] e l l over three-quarters o f the
       population live below the poverty line o f 1United States Dollar per day, while about
       half the nation lives in severe poverty. This i s unacceptable. The current
       unemployment o f an overwhelming majority o f Liberia's people, mainly youth, i s
       also an unacceptable fact that needs to be reversed. Access to and delivery o f basic
       services such as health, education and potable water i s severely restricted for most
       people. Collapsed national and local institutions and structures have resulted invery
       poor governance and widespread corruption. ...
       "The people o f Liberia deserve a better life and their call for it imposes on all o f us,
       my government, the international community, regional partners, civil society,
       academics and well wishers o f Liberia an urgent call to action to overcome these
       challenges. Deepening poverty inLiberia i s not only a threat to peace and security, it
       i s also a threat to the entire region and to the world order. Therefore, my government
       has accorded the top-most priority to addressing these challenges, in particular,
       arresting national economic and social decline, maintaining peace and security while
       respondingto the deep wounds o f the civil war, enhancing accountable governance to
       facilitate reconstruction       and significant poverty reduction and promoting
       reconciliation."

3.3    The broad vision for a new Liberia has been presented in several fora, before the
elections o f 2005, in the President's 2006 inauguration speech, in the 150-Day Action Plan
early in her administration, and in various speeches by President Johnson Sirleaf in and
outside of Liberia since her inauguration. The desire to build a new Liberian nation that is
peaceful, secure, and prosperous lies at the core o f an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy
adopted by government in early 2007.

3.4    The I-PRSP is organized according to the government's own organization into four
cross-ministerial "Pillars":

       i) Enhancingnationalsecurity,
       ii) Revitalizingeconomicgrowth,
       iii) Strengtheninggovernanceandtheruleoflaw,and
       iv)      Rehabilitating infrastructure and delivering basic services.

3.5    The Liberia Reconstruction and Development Committee (LRDC), chaired by the
President with participation o f key cabinet members and Liberia's international partners,
oversees strategy implementation and serves as a policy oversight board. The strategy period



                                                  13

i s July 2006 through June 2008, to coincide with two fiscal years and thus facilitate
integration o f the strategy into the budget process. Government's key priorities include (i)
completing the reform o f the security sector; (ii)   revitalizing agriculture to ensure pro-poor
growth; (iii) rebuildingthe road network; (iv) accelerating humanresource development; (v)
strengthening the environment for private sector growth; (vi) creating jobs; and (vii)
promoting good governance and the rule o f law.

3.6     The strategy is described by pillar below, while the short-term objectives of the
Government's strategy are summarized in policy matrix form in Annex 3. Each o f these
objectives requires donor support, which Liberia i s seeking on the basis o f its I-PRSP and the
full PRSP currently under preparation. More significantly, the Government is keenly aware
that eachpillarrequires prioritization given limitedbudgetresources.

                      A.      PILLAR I:ENHANCING       NATIONAL SECURITY

3.7     The security sector, which i s critical for ensuring security o f persons, property, and
enterprises, has been afflicted by a lack o f professionalism, absence o f democratic control,
absence of accountability to the rule o f law, weak oversight, and inadequate resources. The
security forces are being completely rebuilt following the devastation o f the civil war. The
Government's objectives are to launch a reform process that will ensure that the various
security services are able to serve the population and allow all Liberians to live in a peaceful
environment.

3.8     The first efforts by the Government focused on:

    a   building a capable and democratically accountable military force by completing the
        demobilization o f ex-combatants and recruiting and training 2,000 new Armed Forces
        o f Liberian troops;

    a   strengthening national security institutions by reorganizing all national security
        agencies, developing a national security plan, and demobilizing a significant portion
        of the Special Security Service;

    a   strengthening the Liberian National Police (LNP) through completion of severance
        payments to non-qualified police personnel, continued recruitment o f qualified
        personnel, re-equipping and logistical support to the LNP, restructuring and reform of
        the institution, and the opening o f "Women and Child ProtectionUnits" in four LNP
        stations;

    a   facilitating the return o f refugees and IDPs to their homes; and

    a   seeking 20 percent representation of women in the LNP recruitment process (police
        training also integrates gender inaddressing humanrights abuses).
3.9     The vision for the medium term is to develop a national security strategy to guide
security sector reform and to address the need for:




                                               14

    e   comprehensive security reform with operational and institutional, national and
       regional implications, rationalizing various security forces, ensuring a change in the
        culture o f the security forces, defining clear missions and tasks, and eliminating
        duplications, overlap, andconflicts o f interests between security agencies;

    e   a smooth transfer from international peacekeeping to national security institutions;

    e  reintegration o f ex-combatants, demobilized soldiers, and deactivated police back into
       the communities and into economic activities;

    e   strengthening o f the judiciary;

    e   ensuring gender balance and the integration o f gender perspectives in the armed
        forces and police through strong representation at all levels;

    e   consolidating peace and facilitating national healing through a Truth and
        Reconciliation Commission and an Independent HumanRightsCommission;

    e   establishing strong health programs for security forces, including prevention and
        awareness campaigns for communicable diseases including HIV/AIDS; and

    e   ensuring that ex-combatants who do not qualify for enrollment in the new AFL and
        LNP,have access to opportunities for training, empowerment, and reintegration, as
        well as ensuring that juvenile andyoung offenders have access to rehabilitation.
3.10    This pillar is supported by several partners, primarily the United Nations and the
United States. While security sector reform lies outside the mandate o f the World Bank, it i s
essential to economic recovery and growth, to poverty reduction, and to personalwell-being.
The Bankcoordinates closely with the partners supporting this process.

                    B.      PILLAR 11: REVITALIZINGECONOMICGROWTH

3.11   Under this pillar, the government's short-term objectives have been to stabilize the
economy, create jobs and restore the Government's credibility by using the country's scarce
resources efficiently and effectively. Within its 150-Day Action Plan, the Government
quickly embarked on an IMF SMP, introduced the key components o f the GEMAP program,
and formulated and implementedtargeted interventions.

3.12    On the revenue side, immediately upon taking office, the government began
enforcement o f previously laxly enforced rules on pre-shipment inspection o f imports,
thereby greatly reducing the latitude for customs agents to reclassify imports or to waive
duties, and thereby increasing the government's revenues from duties. Its measures for
increasing compliance with tax laws include strengthening the large taxpayer unit within the
MOF, and reorganization o f the domestic tax administration by taxpayer segment. The
Government has submitted legislation to eliminate fiscal covenants within the investment
code inorder to harmonize andmake more transparent the regime o f tax incentives. GEMAP
controllers in the revenue-generating SOEs are certifying Liberian efforts to suppress fraud
and income-diversion within these enterprises. Under a memorandum o f understanding
created among the government, the commercial banks, and the SOEs, all bank accounts for


                                            15

an SOE have been consolidated at one financial institution, with all revenues booked through
a master account'* that can be monitored by those authorized under GEMAP. As the tax base
becomes broader due to strict enforcement, the government intends to lower the corporate
income tax rate and align import tariffs with the ECOWAS Common External Tariff, with a
view to providing adequate incentives to investors, obviating the need for special tax
concessions. Likewise, the government will also consider reducing the presumptive 4 percent
turnover tax applied to small traders and businesses to 3 percent, inline with prevailing rates
inthe region.

3.13     On the expenditure side, the increase inrevenues is permitting a cautious increase in
assistance to the areas o f greatest need. The severely underpaid civil service has receivedtwo
pay increases. The government has already repaid salary arrears accumulated under the
NTGL and, as revenues permit under the balanced budget, is beginning to repay those
inherited from earlier administrations. The annual budget has been organized around the
priorities o f the I-PRSP; within this, the government is focusing on expenditures with an
immediate payoff to the population, such as an emergency employment program. As the
government will maintain a balanced cash-based budget, cumulative expenditures are limited
to cumulated income, despite predictable variations in monthly income throughout the fiscal
year.

3.14     The government has taken significant steps to im rove fiscal management. The
government resurrected the Cash Management Committee,"which                      had been created in the
1980s but ceased to function after the outbreak o f civil war in 1990, to contain expenditures
within available cash revenues. In addition, it established a functioning budgetary process
(covering preparation, execution, internal and external controls, and reporting). Signature
accountability for authorizations at every step from the budget to the final payment was
introduced. The GEMAP co-signer on the CMC is authorized to clear each proposed expense
according only to three criteria: (i)the item must be in the budget, (ii)there must be
sufficient funds to cover the expense and (iii)        the expenditure must conform to procurement
and commitment control regulations. To accompany a new procurement law that
decentralizes procurement into the line ministries, procurement agents in these ministries
have been trained in public financial management. This has resulted in fewer documents
being rejected by the CMC as incomplete or not justified by the annual budget, but
bottlenecks remain.20 Transparency i s assured by the oversight o f GEMAP experts whose
tasks include verification that these steps have been properly followed in the expenditure
chain from the Bureau o f the Budget through the Ministryo f Finance to the account in the
CBL, thus ensuring that the integrity o f the chain o f expenditures has been established and
maintained.




l8More precisely, for technical reasons there may be two accounts: one account each for US. dollars and
Liberian dollars, as both are legal tender inLiberia.
19The Minister o f Finance serves as the chairperson and the Minister o f Planning, Minister o f State for
Financial, Economic and Legal Affairs, and the Director-General o f the Bureau o f Budget are members, along
with the public financial management advisor (withco-signatory authority) under GEMAP.
2oThe slow spending partly reflects an inevitable learning curve, as the Budget Bureau, line ministries and
agencies, and the Ministryo f Finance implement improved procurement and approval procedures.


                                                     16

3.15    InFY06/07 the government introduced cashplanningfor all ministries andagencies.
Previously the CMC had issued allotments based on the annual budget pro-rated by allotment
period. Annual cash plans are now prepared which are consolidated and sent to the Bureau o f
the Budget, which then issues monthly allotments based on this cash plan. The cash plans are
prioritized and revisited on a quarterly basis. A series o f workshops was conducted for the
Comptrollers o f the line ministries/agencies to familiarize them with the new concept.
However, due to lack o f capacity some units are still preparing cash plans on a straight-line
basis. Also, further work is required to ensure that commitment control takes into account
long term commitments e.g. multi-year contracts.

3.16    Other early achievements include a clean-up o f the procurement process, introduction
o f internal controls and overhaul o f financial management procedures as well as measures
aimed at fighting corruption inthe public sector.

3.17    To increase transparency and accountability, the annual budget i s submitted to the
Legislature where it is discussed and amended. The national budget for FY06/07, although
late inbeing submitted, passed and implemented, was a remarkable document for being the
first budget submitted for legislative review indecades. Despite the tradeoffs required by the
political process in an opposition-dominated legislature, its passage reflects a milestone in
the introduction o f transparency, public accountability, and good governance. By improving
its preparation the government was able to submit its FY07/08 budget to the legislature on
schedule in May 2007. The draft budget, the final budget, and quarterly budget execution
reports have been published regularly, including posting on Ministry o f Finance web site
(www.mofliberia.org), as are monthly revenue outturns andregular SOE financial reports.

3.18    The government began to enforce transparency and sound economic management on
its very first days in office by canceling all forest concession contracts executed under
previous regimes, together with contracts for the Container Park at the Free Port o f Monrovia
and the contracts of the Liberia Petroleum Refining Company, because o f their lack o f
compliance with Liberian law. The new allocation o f forest concessions i s being prepared
within a transparent and competitive framework that also respects environmental standards.
With Bank and United States assistance, it also established a new Forestry Act, the passage
o f which was a requirement for the lifting o f UNSC sanctions on timber exports. Reforming
the forestry sector was not only a requirement for fully lifting the sanctions on timber, but in
the future will ensure that the sector is managed in a sustainable manner. In addition, the
Government initiated a review o f all concessions and contracts granted under the NTGL with
a view both to nullifyingillegal contracts and demonstrating to potential investors that going
forward, the rule o f law will be obeyed. In parallel with this, a significant NTGL iron ore
concession agreement with the firm now known as ArcelorMittal NV was renegotiated in a
constructive manner to the benefit o f Liberia. A UN/Government o f Liberia Rubber
PlantationTask Force was instituted to ensure proper administration o f plantations owned by
the government and those that have been freed from occupying militias and are being
prepared for public auction.

3.19     The government also set out to begin to provide electricity and water service, and in
late July 2006, it restored power and water services to parts o f Monrovia for the first time in
15 years as a first step to reestablishing these services more widely. The government also


                                            17

initiated reforms and improvements in CBL operations focusing on making the banking
system fully market-based and transparent and prepared and published a monetary policy
framework paper.

3.20    The initial impact o f these measures and the economy's response to the policy regime
has been positive as indicated in the description o f the macroeconomic performance above,
with real growth accelerating from 5.3 percent in 2005 to an estimated 7.8 percent in 2006.
Tax revenue was 72 percent higher in FY2006/2007 compared to a year earlier.** FY
2006/07 total revenue o f US$146.8 million significantly surpassed the revenue target o f
US$120.9 million under the IMF Staff-Monitored Program.

3.21    Looking forward, the Liberia Emergency Employment Program attempts to engage
more than 17,000 young people inquick employment projects within the two years.

3.22    A major constraint on effective policymaking is the lack o freliable data and statistics.
The LISGIS was established by act o f the Transitional National Assembly inNovember 2004
and is now the principal national agency responsible for the collection and publication o f
official statistics. A substantial amount o f investment is needed to return to even a semblance
o f pre-war capability. Targeted programs will be developed in collaboration with partners to
build LISGIS' capacity to collect, analyze, and disseminate statistics on national accounts,
the consumer price index, trade, environment, and food security, and to conduct the census
and demographic and health surveys. LISGIS has submitted a proposal for assistance to the
Statistical Capacity BuildingTrust Fund, and assistance is likely from Afristat.
3.23    A key objective o f the medium-term agenda is to promote economic growth as the
foundation for poverty reduction and sustained development. The Government intends to
implement measures to broaden the tax base and increase revenues. Steps already taken
include increasing the excise tax on beer and cigarettes and redefining the base o f the goods
and services tax in line with the provisions o f the 2000 Liberia Revenue Code, while those
still planned include: expansion o f the pre-shipment inspection program; expansion o f the
computerized revenue collection system to cover miscellaneous taxes, the Port o f Monrovia,
and the international airport; reducing import tax exemptions, including through better
management and monitoring o f the exemptions o f NGOs and religious organizations;
rigorous implementation o f a program to collect overdue tax/duty obligations; and strict
enforcement o f the Executive Order that centralizes revenue collection in the Ministry o f
Finance. It will advance work on the comprehensive import tariff reform to move Liberia
towards the ECOWAS Common External Tariff, and begin implementing other IMF tax
policy recommendations. It also seeks to uproot corruption in revenue administration.
Recurrent expenditures aimed at restoring the orderly functioning o f public administration
still dominate the budget, limitingthe scope for shiftingresources into more spending for the
economic and social sectors; while such a pattern o f spending i s understandable in a country
emerging from prolonged conflict, the Government i s committed to containing personnel-
related spending (particularly removing ghost employees from the payroll and facilitating the
departure o f redundant and retirement-age staff) in order to facilitate the financing o f
programs with visible on-the-ground impact.

3.24      The program articulated inthe I-PRSP confirms the private sector's role as the main
engine o f growth. Medium-term measures to support the private sector include maintaining
macroeconomic stability, strengthening economic governance, and addressing impediments
to private sector development. The Government has submitted to the legislature a new
investment code that reflects international best practice. The Government intends to address
other impediments identified in a recent FIAS analysis o f the investment climate, including
(i)the legalandregulatoryincentivestructurethat hasledto alargeinformalsector, (ii)
energy supply, (iii) to finance, (iv) land ownership and tenure, (v) tax policy, and (vi)
                       access
administrative and regulatory issues. To integrate Liberia further into the world economy and
promote economic efficiency, the Government will initiate a program o f comprehensive tariff
reform to adopt the ECOWAS common external tariff. The World Bank Group (particularly
FIAS, IFC, andWBI) and other partners areproviding assistance onthe investmentclimate.

           c.     PILLAR 111:STRENGTHENINGGOVERNANCEAND THE RULEOF LAW

3.25      Liberia's crises over the last quarter century from war, mismanagement and human
rights abuse, which contributed to the deepening o f poverty, can be blamed largely on poor
governance. War led to widespread violation and abuse o f humanrights, including deliberate
and arbitrary killings and violence against civilians including women and children,
disappearances, torture, forced child soldiers, and rape. Reversal o f persistent poor
governance practices requires an effort to change the value systems o f the Liberian people
and restructuring and strengthening o f central and local governance institutions, systems, and
processes.

3.26      The Government has begun to lay the foundation for good governance and a
restoration o f the justice system. In its early months it has (i) redefined and refocused the
mandates, structures, and functions o f public institutions, (ii)  developed a comprehensive
anti-corruption policy, strategy, and implementation framework and submitted legislation to
establish an anti-corruption commission, (iii)transformed the Governance Reform
Commission established under the Accra Peace Accord into an organ o f the State that will
continue to monitor the governance reform agenda and process, (iv) established a Truth and
Reconciliation Commission and an Independent National Commission for Human Rights, (v)
begun to develop a more professional and efficient civil service commission and cadre, and
(vi) initiated discussion on the relationship between the central government and local
government.

3.27      All Ministers under the new government have publicly declared their assets.
Transparency and accountability in public financial management are demonstrated by the
sharp increase in revenues, the operations o f the CMC, and the implementation o f the
GEMAP. A Truth and Reconciliation Commission created to account for atrocities
committed from April 1979 to October 2003 i s working to foster reconciliation within and
between Liberia's polarized communities. The Governance Reform Commission i s working
to restore and reform institutions o f government and to ensure democratic self-governance
that i s inclusive, participatory, andjust. Additionally, the Independent National Commission
on Human Rights has been established to fight the culture o f impunity and protect and
promote human rights, including economic, social, and cultural rights. The University o f
Liberia has established a Center for Conflict Transformation which aims to undertake


                                              19

research, offer courses, and give policy advice. The capacity o f Liberia's civil society is also
increasing, with at least 20 national NGOs focusing on peace-building initiatives and
conflict-sensitive development issues, alongside the faith-based and community-based
organizations that undertake peace buildingand conflict resolution.
3.28     The Bank-funded technical assistance in the Resource Management Unit (RMU)
within the Ministry o f Finance is identiffing and implementing capacity-building programs
infinancial management, including recruitingandtraining a batchof 30 university graduates
over a two-year period. In May 2005, the RMU launched a series o f refresher training
courses for staff o f the Expenditure and Debt Management Department. Three cycles o f this
training have involved 77 staff. Between the first and second training cycles, RMU staff
designed and conducted a workshop for staff o f the Pre-Audit section o f the Bureau o f
General Accounting to introduce the procedures adapted by the CMC to streamline the
processing o f vouchers, and built on this with a course for 25 audit staff o f the Internal Audit
Division and Physical Audit Unit o f the Ministry o f Finance. Outside o f the Ministry o f
Finance, the RMU conducted a workshop on Commitment Control for Comptrollers and
Directors o f Finance o f the various line ministries and agencies. With the introduction o f the
Interim Financial Rules, Foreign Travel Ordinance, and Public Procurement Law, a
workshop was held to orient the line ministries in the provisions and requirements o f these
new regulations.
3.29     To help ensure transparency, civil society is represented on the EGSC and the
GEMAP technical team and can report freely on GEMAP and its findings. The Government
is developing a strategy for dealing with past corrupt acts, though the financing o f the
proposed anti-corruption agency continues to be a challenge.

3.30     The medium-term objective o f the Government i s to strengthen governance and the
rule o f law to ensure Liberia witnesses no more conflict and gross violations o f human rights.
It aims to support balanced development and a culture o f accountability. Steps undertaken
and to be continued under the Government's program include:

    0    reforming and rebuildingthe public sector;

    0    decentralizingpolitical governance and social responsibilities;

    0    strengthening the rule o f law andrespecting humanrights;

         forcefully addressing gender inequities;

    0    rebuilding civil society and the media;

         encouraging broader participation inthe governance process; and       .

    0    reducing corruption with a zero tolerance policy.

3.31     The Government's ability to implement its poverty reduction strategy is severely
circumscribed by the lack o f skilled personnel at the senior civil servant level. As a result o f
political patronage and the effects o f war over many years, Liberia's civil service today
disproportionately reflects high numbers o f unskilled workers, with little technical capacity
to deliver even basic services. Nonetheless, prior to the civil war, Liberia's civil service did
function respectably by regional standards, with a working bureaucracy. The absence o f such


                                             20

skilled personnel leaves policy-makers operating in a vacuum with limited implementation
capability. Civil service reform i s high on the Government's agenda, as a prerequisite to
improved service delivery.
3.32   The Bank i s supporting activities under the governance and rule o f law pillar, both
directly through the country program and indirectly through our support to GEMAP, along
with other partners.

 D.      PILLAR   Iv:REHABILITATINGINFRASTRUCTUREAND               DELIVERINGBASICSERVICES

3.33    The Government's aim in the short term i s to restore basic services to facilitate
economic activities and fight poverty. Without adequate infrastructure the ability to reduce
poverty will be severely hindered, increasing the likelihood o f a return to conflict. Upon
coming into power in January 2006, the new administration inherited an infrastructure that
was in a state o f complete disrepair as a result o f the war and years o f neglect. The task
before the government i s essentially to rehabilitate this infrastructure despite serious financial
and capacity constraints in order to create the conditions needed to achieve broad-based
growth and poverty reduction. In its 150-Day Action Plan the Government (i)             began the
rehabilitation o f several hundreds o f kilometers o f roads and a few bridges; (ii)  rehabilitated
about 36 high schools, 39 clinics, and 4 community health facilities; (iii)financed
community development projects in all 15 counties; (iv) began to rebuild the electricity grid
within Monrovia; (v) strengthened the national health strategy to fight HIV/AIDS and
provided bed nets in malaria-endemic communities, as well as medicines for new cases o f
tuberculosis; (vi) rehabilitated water pipelines in certain parts o f Monrovia and constructed
100 new water points and 52 new boreholes around the country; (vii) initiated reforms inthe
education sector, rehabilitating several schools; and (viii) increased budgetary outlays for
health and education to 8.9 and 8.6 percent o f the budget, respectively.

3.34    Key elements o fthe medium-tern strategy include:
        Telecommunications: Rationalization o f the sector, including rehabilitating the fixed
        line system, providing oversight o f GSM, and putting into place an enhanced
        regulatory framework;

        Transport: Restoration o f the road network through maintenance o f paved roads,
        upgradingprimaryroads, andrehabilitation o f secondary and feeder roads;

        Electricity: Rebuildingo f the power network;

        Water and Sanitation: Increase in the supply o f safe drinking water and improved
        urbanandrural sanitation;

        Education: Implementation o f comprehensive education policy reform, curriculum
       review and development, and improving the strategic capacity o f the educational
        administrative system; and

       Health andNutrition: Provision o fbasic health andnutrition services.

      4.      BANKGROUP'S SUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM


                                     A.      LINKTOTHEISN

4.1       On June 14, 2007, in response to the favorable evolution o f the situation including
stabilization o fthe security situation and the successful elections, ajoint World Bank-African
Development Bank Interim Strategy Note (ISN)                  covering the 12-month I-PRSP
implementation period was discussed by the Executive Directors. The overarching objective
o f this Interim Strategy is to support Liberia's transition from post-conflict reliefto long-term
development, while laying the foundations for sustained and shared economic growth. This i s
underpinned by a three-pronged approach focusing on rebuilding o f state capacity, ensuring
visible impact, and closely coordinating with other donors. The approach i s closely aligned
with the government I-PRSP with all assistance falling within three o f the four main pillars
o f the I-PRSP: (i)   revitalizing the economy; (ii)strengthening governance and the rule o f
law; (iii) rehabilitating infrastructure and delivering basic services.

4.2      The proposed grant supports the full normalization o f relations between IDA and
Liberia and is thus a critical element o f the ISN. It would facilitate the clearance o f Liberia's
arrears to IBRD and IDA, create needed fiscal space during the period leading to the H P C
Completion Point, and provide additional financing sought by the Government for improved
public financial management in the Ministry o f Finance and the Bureau o f the Budget. The
operation would support government-owned reforms to improve the country's fiduciary
environment and strengthen public institutions.

                 B.       COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER BANKACTIVITIES

4.3      Three activities are direct companions to the proposed RRSP grant as they provide
financial and technical assistance in the areas it supports: (i)a Public Expenditure
Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) was recently launched and is
expected to be completed in FY08 in coordination and with support from other partners.
Building on three years o f Bank-supported assistance inprocurement reform and technical
assistance to the Ministry o f Finance, the PEMFAR will produce a fiduciary assessment,
deepen the dialogue among Liberia and its partners on public financial management issues
andprepare a prioritized Action Planwith priorities for the nextphase o fthe Public Financial
Management (PFM) reform aimed at further strengthening budget formulation and execution.
This will also prepare the ground for future possible programmatic support to Liberia; (ii)       a
Technical Assistance grant (US$6 million) is currently under preparation to continue to
provide support to the government for the implementation o f the GEMAP, additional priority
reforms identified by the PEMFAR and other difficult reforms required to attain the HIPC
Completion Point; and (iii)    LICUS and TFLIB grant funding o f US$7.2 million followed by
an IDA pre-arrears clearance grant o f US$5 million (approved on June 14, 2007,) have
supported efforts by the Liberian Agency for Community Empowerment (LACE) to foster
local governance. Liberia also receives assistance inbudget training for members o f the new
legislature from the World Bank Institute, and will be receiving assistance in statistical
capacity building from the Statistical Capacity Building Trust Fund administered by the
Bank.


                                              22

                           c.      COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMF

4.4     The World Bank and IMF have collaborated closely in supporting GEMAP since its
beginningand inmonitoring fiscal development. Staffs from the two institutions are working
together closely on arrears clearance and the HIPC process. In view o f the structural
measures envisaged under the IMF's medium-term program, successful implementation of
this program hinges on assistance to date and complementary actions going forward by the
World Bank, especially in the areas o f procurement, public financial management, business
climate improvements, poverty reduction policies, and nonrenewable resource management.
Both institutions support the preparation o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy and, in that
context, will continue to provide support for strengthening Liberia's statistical capacity. The
World Bank's work inpublic expenditure and financial accountability is performed in close
collaboration with the IMF. The IMF is providing technical assistance inthe area o f revenue
administration. The IMF leads the dialogue on policies related to the medium-term fiscal
framework and will work closely with the World Bank on wage policy and poverty-related
expenditure. The IMF also leads the dialogue on monetary policy and bankrestructuring, and
statistical and measurement issues relating to monetary aggregates, balance o f payments, and
inflation. The Bank takes into account the policy recommendations o f the IMF and the two
institutions ensure that their policy advice i s consistent.

4.5     Liberia has been implementing a staff monitored program (SMP) since February
2006. On February 7, 2007, the IMF Executive Board noted that the government had made
satisfactory progress in implementing policies under the SMP, and that achievements under
the SMP had supported a recovery in real GDP growth, fostered price and exchange rate
stability, and brought about a significant improvement in public financial management and
the financial position o f the Central Bank o f Liberia. The IMF Board was also informed
about the 2007 SMP, and agreed with the staffs assessment that the program meets the
standards o f an upper credit tranche IMF program, apart from financing assurances; this
program is being executed, though there were delays in meeting some o f the June and
September 2007 structural benchmarks. IMF management has received funding assurances
for a financing package that can allow the Fundto move forward with arrears clearance and
debt relief for Liberia. Fund staff i s also working on possible modifications to IMF policies
to allow Liberia to quickly reach the HIPC Initiative DP and to receive MDRI-type debt
reliefonce the necessary financing has been secured.

             D.      COORDINATION AND HARMONIZATIONWITH OTHER DONORS

4.6     Donors coordinate closely inLiberia. GEMAP was ajoint response to various failures
ingovernance that had each been independentlyidentified by the World Bank, the IMF, the
EC, andECOWAS. It was an approach by the EC, the United States, andthe Bank with input
and support from the IMF, ECOWAS, the UN, the African Union and international partners
represented in Monrovia (principally Germany, Ghana, Nigeria, Sweden, and the United
Kingdom), and strongly affirmed byPresident Johnson Sirleaf inher inaugural address with a
pledge that her administration's performance would render it unnecessary. The international
partners meet regularly to confer on strategy and to ensure that "holes" can be filled to
guarantee results. Both the EGSC and the LRDC bring together both donors and key
government representatives on a regular basis. Although the AfDB has no permanent


                                               23

representation inLiberia, the World Bank and AfDB collaborate closely as evidenced by the
joint ISN. The PEMFAR will provide an opportunity for close donor and government
coordination inthe definition o fthe nextphase o f the PFMreform program.

                            Box 4.1:Donor Coordination/Harmonization

  Coordination among donors and partners has been very close during the re-engagement process inLiberia.
  The Accra Comprehensive Peace Accord is overseen by the International Contact Group on Liberia
  (ICGL), co-chaired by the European Commission and the Economic Community o f West African States
  (ECOWAS); the Bank began as observer but since 2005 has been a full member. Under the National
  Transitional Government o f Liberia (NTGL) the Bank financed and led the coordination function o f the
  Results-Focused Transition Framework. The GEMAP i s coordinated by the Economic Governance
  Steering Committee (EGSC), which i s chaired by the Head o f State and brings together donors,
  international and regional (ECOWAS, African Union) partners, key ministries and civil society on matters
  o f governance; the GEMAP itself was negotiated only with the active participation o f major donors, the
  membersofthe ICGL andthe UnitedNations Security Council. The GEMAPTechnical Team (TT) airs out
  problems arising in GEMAP implementation and promotes progress in capacity building. Shortly after
  coming to power, the current government organized its functions around the four Pillars o f its strategy,
  each Pillar headed by a key ministry with an international donor serving as secretariat; the overall strategy
  i s coordinated by the Liberia Reconstruction and Development Committee (LRDC) which serves as a
  coordinating mechanism for development assistance. Several coordinating bodies related to the
  humanitarian crisis have been transformed into Liberian-led administrative units bringing together donors
  and the Liberian agencies they assist. Coordination among domestic and international partners has been
  maintained at a high level. Finally, the small number o f key international partners present in Monrovia
  facilitates frequent informal consultation to avoid the emergence o f problems in program design and
  implementation, a task which is difficult incountries with broader international representation. The AfDB,
  with no permanent presence in Monrovia, i s kept fully informed as was the IMF in the period before it
  established its local representation.
  The LRDC and EGSC meet on a monthly basis, the EGSC occasionally less often due to the requirement
  that the Head o f State cannot delegate the role o f chair at EGSC meetings. The TT meets biweekly. In
  addition, subcommittees under the LRDC Pillars meet regularly to address particular issues.
  Owing to low administrative capacity (most evident inthe shortage o f trained staff to support the Ministers
  and their immediate deputies), transaction costs related to the management o f donor relations immediately
  became an excessive burden for the government.
  Twenty-two months o f experience suggest that the LRDC system serves well in promoting dialogue
  between the Government and the donors. Future work will, among other things, focus on further
  minimizing transactions costs as well as improving assistance to the process o f creating and implementing a
  full PRSP, includingthe creation o f a monitoringand evaluation system. A second area where further work
  needs to be done i s the availability o f reliable data to d o r m the monitoring and performance indicators.
  Inconclusion, Liberia is introducing mechanisms for budget support coordination and harmonization, but
  some significant challenges that go beyond the framework o fbudget support remain to be solved to m h e r
  strengthen the system.



   5.        THE REENGAGEMENTAND REFORMSUPPORT PROGRAMGRANT


                                A.         DESCRIPTION OFTHE OPERATION

5.1       ReformProgram. Liberia's efforts to recover depend strongly on the government's
ability to finance essential domestic activities. It must do so in a transparent manner so as to
elicit public support and public participation and to eliminate the culture o f corruption that


                                                        24

has long characterized the public sector, as well as to eliminate the sources o f such
corruption. As Liberia emerges from decades o f corruption and the collapse o f the State, the
Government has taken bold steps in its first 18 months, and the international community's
response during this window o f opportunity will help the people o f Liberia regain confidence
in the ability of their government to deliver basic services and foster an environment for
economic growth.

5.2     The Government's interim strategy, codified inits I-PRSP, i s described in Section 3.
This constitutes the reference framework behind the Government's Letter o f Development
Policy (LDP) attached as Annex 2 and its policy matrix in Annex 3. Through its LDP, the
Government has requested that IDA support an important subset o f the reforms outlined inits
strategy, primarily under Pillar 11, for revitalizing the economy. As described in Section 4,
other donors are supporting other reform areas. The World Bank's support to the full strategy
i s described in the ISN; the Bank's assistance to the Government in improving its public
financial management systems i s described below (Section 6, Operation Implementation).

5.3     Policy Matrix. The Government's reform program is outlined in the policy action
matrix (Annex 3). The proposed operation will support a specific subset o f the actions under
Pillar I1o f the matrix. The operation helps the Government address fiscal stabilization, fiscal
management and transparency, and is the first Development Policy Operation in Liberia. By
clearing the way for IDA and other multilaterals, notably the AfDB, to reengage with full-
scale programs in Liberia, this Grant also prepares the ground for possible hture
programmatic support to Liberia. Such support would be subject to the availability o f
resources and the overall progress in implementing reforms as well as the evolution o f the
country's situation, andwould support the Government's development strategy.

5.4     Relation to IF1Arrears Clearance. This proposed grant is embedded in a broader,
coordinated strategy for arrears clearance by the AfDB, the IMF, and the World Bank. Fiscal
stabilization, improved fiscal management, and transparency in its fiscal operations, together
with other elements o f the Government's strategy that commit it to pro-poor spending and
support for economic growth, prepare the stage for arrears clearance and rapid transition to
debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. The principal difficulty involved with arrears
clearance for Liberia has been the scale o f the arrears (whether measured on a per capita
basis, as a share o f GDP, or in absolute terms) and the lack o f resources, both within the
government and within the international community to address the clearance. After exploring
options, the IMFhas chosen to implement a pro-rata rebate o f the SCA-1 to its contributors, a
sufficient number o f whom have pledged these resources to Liberia so that Fund
management is able to propose to its Board a facility for arrears clearance and the provision
o f new resources. The AfDB will use its Post Conflict Country Facility (PCCF) framework.
This typically calls for equal burdensharing between the borrower, the PCCF and donors for
arrears clearance. However, on account o f Liberia's very limitedpayment capacity, it will be
expected to make at most a small contribution to clearing its arrears to the AFDB Group, the
PCCF will finance 69 percent, and donors will provide the balance.

5.5     Objective. The objectives o f the proposed grant are to: (i) facilitate the clearance of
Liberia's arrears to IBRD and IDA, which i s required in order to restore normal relations
between Liberia and the World Bank; and (ii) the Government's efforts to establish a
                                                support


                                             25

rigorous fiscal underpinning for the Liberian economy that will permit accelerated recovery
and growth. The grant would support key measures in the government's strategy, including
to: (i)stabilize the fiscal situation, (ii)
                                          improve fiscal management, and (iii)accomplish both
o f these objectives in a new regime o f public transparency concerning both revenues and
expenditures. This strategy would lead over time to strengthened fiscal sustainability,
improved economic governance, and enhanced transparency o f State institutions and
processes.

5.6     The resources made available by this grant will create a fiscal space that would assist
the government in implementing activities that would otherwise be beyond its fiscal
capabilities, potentially including the salary component o f a civil service reform and
introducing improved financial management procedures in ministries. Normalization o f
relations with the World Bank would (i)        set the stage for the provision o f regular IDA
resources; (ii)facilitate Liberia's efforts to reestablish relations with the rest o f the
international community, including both other creditors and donor agencies; and (iii)     pave
the way for Liberia to access debt reliefunder the HIPC and MDRIinitiatives.

5.7     Design. The amount o f the grant is estimated to be around US$[416.4] million. Of
this, at the request o f the Liberian authorities, about US$[388.0] million would be used to
reimburse directly to the institution that would extend the bridge loan used to clear Liberia's
arrears to IBRD (US$[332.3] million) and to IDA (US$[55.7] million). Inorder to ensure that
the bridge loan will cover any exchange rate fluctuations during the arrears clearance
operation, said bridge loan will incorporate a 5 percent operating margin. The final
settlement o f the arrears will be produced by the Bank at the earliest possible date after
arrears clearance and the final amount will be notified to the borrower; any unused margin
will be cancelled from the grant.

                      B.       PRIOR ACTIONSFORTHE PROPOSEDGRANT

5.8     The proposed operation supports key policy reforms under Pillar I1 o f the
Government's policy matrix. Specifically, it supports specific actions aimed at improving
systems and establishing a rigorous fiscal underpinning that will permit the aggressive
recovery and growth o f the economy. These measures will help to stabilize the fiscal
situation and improve fiscal management, accomplishing both o f these objectives in a regime
o f public transparency concerning both revenues and expenditures. There are six prior
actions for the proposed grant:

    a. Adopt administrative measures to ensure that the Cash Management Committee i s
        fully operational and effective.
    b. Submit to the legislature prior to the commencement o f the Fiscal Year beginning
        July 1,2007 abill o f law for the approval o fits 2007-2008 budget.
    c. Increase government revenues by at least 16 percent for the period February 1, 2006
        through June 30, 2006, and 74 percent for the entire fiscal year July 1, 2006-June 30,
        2007 relative to the same periods inthe previous fiscal year.




                                             26

     d. Meet the official criteria to become a candidate country for the Extractive
         Industries Transparency Initiative.
     e. Submit to the President and Chair o f the Economic Governance Steering Committee
         findings o f a report on the legality, transparency, andpublic benefit of all concessions
         andcontracts signed underthe periodo fthe NTGL.
     f. Increase revenues from taxes on international trade by 35 percent for the period
         February 1, 2006 through June 30, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005,
         through improved enforcement o fpre-shipment inspection and customs regulations.
5.9      Cash ManagementCommittee(CMC) effectiveness. The effective operationo fthis
committee is essential for accomplishment o f the Program. The Government's policy reforms
depend not on the signature o f a policy statement or passage o f a law, but on the
implementation o f the decisions represented therein. The CMC had ceased to function in
1990 but was reconvened in October 2004 by the NTGL and Liberia's partners. The CMC
has been in operation since and provides the basis for the successful implementation o f the
Government's fiscal reforms by ensuring that only items in the annual budget are approved
for disbursement, and that there i s sufficient cash to finance the expenditure under a balanced
cash-based budget.

5.10     Submission of the budget to the legislature. Inmodem history, the legislature has
not exercised a role in budget design, approval, or oversight. The current Government has
submitted its budget to the legislature for its approval, bringing the legislature into an
oversight role, beginning with the FY06/07 budget submitted in June 2006 and approved
after the beginning o f the fiscal year, and continuing with the submission o f the FY07/08
budget on May 17, 2007 and its approval with amendments inJune. Because o f the novelty
o f this role and, therefore, the lack o f experience in its judicious application exacerbated by
the presence inthe new legislature o f members o f the leadership o f previous regimes, there
were some "teething problems" inthe first round. These contributed to late budget approval,
accumulation o f salary arrears (rectified after budget approval) during the first month o f the
new fiscal year, andpossibly to delays ininitiating lengthy procurement processes that were
partially responsible for under-spendingfor the fiscal year. Also, and as indicated above, the
legislature increased provisions in the FY07/08 budget for a community development fbnd
and for civil service pay that exceeded the administration's budgeted increase. As the
amended budget was approved by a majority sufficient to override any veto, this budget was
signed into law. The Ghana Institute o f Management, with regional partners and the UNDP,
i s providing training to the legislature on fiscal prerogatives andresponsibilities.

5.11     Government revenues.The commitment o f the Government to its program can be
demonstrated by results, specifically an increase in revenues from the FY05/06 level. Inits
first five months in office (February to June 2006) the Government demonstrated such a
capability and raised revenues by 16 percent compared to the same period o f FY04/05. For
FY06/07, a 74-percent increase over the previous fiscal year i s evidence o f the commitment
to achieving the goal o f increased revenues, transparentlydeclared.

5.12     Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. The Government is coming into
compliance with the EITI. Its signature on July 10, 2007 o f a document confirming its prior


                                                 27

conformance to three o f the four necessary criteria22demonstrates to the potential investors
in extractive industries and forestry that Liberia is indeed open for business, with a
transparent governance regime intended to prevent the worldwide abuses o f the past in
mineral and forest exploitation. The Government has subsequently met the September
deadline for the final criterion, a work plan, and has been admitted as an EITI candidate
country.

5.13     Concessions and contracts. The government i s taking firm steps to improve the
legality, transparency, and public benefit o f its concessions and contracts. A new Public
Procurement and Concessions Act, developed with World Bank technical assistance, became
effective on January 1, 2006 and i s overseen by a new Public Procurment and Concessions
Commission. President Johnson Sirleaf`s               Executive Order Number One nullified all
outstanding timber concessions based on a review o f their legal basis. New timber
concessions, like all others, will be awarded through a transparent, competitive process. A
contract for a container park at the Monrovia Free Port and a US$12 million contract by the
National Petroleum Refining Company that had been found by the international community
to have been illegally obtained under the NTGL were also nullified. The Government has
completed a review o f all contracts and concessions entered during the NTGLwith a view to
canceling those that were illegal, did not conform to norms o f public procurement, or did not
provide value for money to the Liberian people.

5.14     Taxes on international trade. International trade provides the major source o f
government revenue, though the government has initiated efforts to increase revenues from
direct taxation. Trade taxation (or its avoidance) has also been a major source o f corruption
in Liberia's past. A 35 percent increase in revenue from taxes on international trade in
February to June 2006 (compared to the same period in 2005) largely or even entirely
through improved enforcement, again represents a significant demonstration o f commitment
in eliminating "old ways" and demonstrating reform to the people of Liberia as well as the
country's partners. In a continued demonstration o f this commitment, taxes on international
trade nearly doubled (increasing by 97 percent) in fiscal 2006/2007 relative to fiscal
2005/2006.

5.15     Other actions. The six prior actions specified here establish a core o f activities
essential to support the reform program for fiscal recovery and economic growth. The
government's policy matrix (Annex 3) describes additional policies that will help sustain
these efforts.. The government intends to implement further actions in support o f this
program that will lay the groundwork for future budget support by IDA and other donors.

                  c.       FURTHERACTIONS FOR SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM

5.16    In addition to the actions taken prior to effectiveness o fthis grant, other policy steps
will be considered, and the results evaluated, for possible hture budget support from IDA.

                                                  28

These steps that would be financed from the Government budget and with externally-
financed technical assistanceinclude:

      a. Make the Liberia Expenditure Control and Accounting Program (LECAP)
          operational inthe Ministry o fFinance andthe Bureau o f the Budget;
      b. Improve the legislative framework for public financial management by
          submittingto the Legislature a Public Finance Act, as well as an amended
          Public Procurement and Concessions Act (PPCA). Introduce regulations,
          manuals and instructions to implement the PPCA;
      c. Approve by Cabinet a comprehensive Civil Service Reform strategy and its
          publication;
      d. Audit Government accounts for key ministries for FY05-06 and FY06-07;
          and
      e. Revise the National Investment Code to remove provisions that provide for
          ad hoc tax incentives to individuals and firms.

5.17     In addition, future budget support from IDA would depend upon the continued
integrity o f the entire budget process, to assure that reallocations and additions such as those
voted by the legislature for the FY07/08 budget represent the results o f the relevant agency or
institution's legitimate role in the budget process and not the diversion o f incremental
government resources outside the monitoring role o f GEMAP.

5.18     Liberia ExpenditureControl and Accounting Program. LECAP is a customized
package that has been developed to meet the specific requirements o f the Ministry o f Finance
for budget monitoring, tracking o f commitments, processing and approval o f vouchers,
listing before the Cash Management Committee, printingo f cheques, preparation o f monthly
expenditure statements, and manual bank reconciliation. An electronic link has been
established with the Central Bank o f Liberia and the bank reconciliation process is being
automated. As a next step to improve the control environment and the monitoring o f
expenditures, the Government will enhance the capacity o f LECAP and make it fully
operational in both the Ministryo f Finance and the Bureau o f the Budget. Within MOF the
accounting functions o f LECAP will be improved through linking LECAP with the S U N
Microsystems accounting package that has already been procured by MOF. LECAP will
capture the data required by S U N and this would enable the production o f accounting trial
balances, and double entry accounting, financial statements and provide for an audit trail.
The introduction o f such a system is far less advanced in the Bureau o f the Budget (BOB),
with its own system based on a spreadsheet program that produces many duplicate codes
when transmitted to the MOF. BOB i s currently using LECAP to correct the problem o f
duplicate codes. Having the same program in both BOB and M O F will enable much better
linkingo f actual expenditures to budget allotments and monitoring o f the process. Once this
core linkage i s established between MOF and BOB, this package can be extended to line
ministries. LECAP will form one component o f the Integrated Financial Management
Information System being developed with Bank support.

5.19     Legislativeframework for public financial management.The Government would
submit to the Legislature a new Public Finance Act. After review o f the weaknesses o f the


                                              29

PPCA that took effect inJanuary 2006, the government would also prepare and submit to the
legislature an amended Public Procurement and Concessions Act         . The Government would
also introduce a set o f implementingregulations, manuals and instructions to ensure a correct
application o f the PPCA. These could represent an important evolution in financial
management regulation and would provide assurances to donors considering budget support.

5.20    Civil Service Reform. Cabinet would approve and publish a comprehensive Civil
Service Reform strategy currently beingdeveloped with assistance from the World Bank and
DFID.Pay andCompensationReform would be finalized as part o fthis strategy and its costs
incorporatedinthe government budget.

5.21    Audit of government accounts. The office o f the Auditor General, which has
recently been strengthened, would become more effective with the audit o f government
accounts for FY05-06 and FY06-07. Lacking the human and financial resources for a
complete audit, the Auditor General would perform risk-based audits targeting the agencies
and ministries posing the largest fiduciary and financial risk for these two fiscal years.

5.22    The National Investment Code would be revised to remove provisions for ad hoc
incentives to individuals and firms. A law to this effect has been submitted to the legislature,
which i s currently on annual recess and which will consider the matter upon its return.

                         Box 5.1:GoodPracticePrincipleson Conditionality

Principle1:Reinforce Ownership

This RRSP is embedded in the Governance and Economic Management Assistance Program (GEMAP), a
governance framework for assuring fiscal responsibility while building capacity, and led by the Economic
Governance Steering Committee (EGSC) chaired by the Head o f State. The program was created in September
2005 and endorsed by the current President inher inaugural address, together with the pledge to take the actions
to make it unnecessary. The RRSP focuses on (i)        ownership o f the reform process; (ii)alignment with the
country's I-PRSP; and (iii)results-based approach which is coordinatedand agreed upon among the government
                            a
and the donors. I t is expected that government ownership and management o f the program, together with steps
taken further to improve transparency and governance, will encourage donors to channel assistance through the
budget.

Principle2: Agree upfront with the Government and otherfinancialpartners on a coordinated accountability
framework

Concerning governance, the EGSC updates objectives, responsibilities and performance indicators on an annual
basis and reviews them quarterly. In the broader environment o f reconstruction and development, the I-PRSP
objectives matrices serve a similar role, with an update expected after one year with the development o f the full
PRSP. These two procedures allow for accountability along shared objectives and performance indicators. The
close coordination and harmonization among donors and with the Government's reform policy program also
permits improved predictability o f budget resources.

Principle3: Customizethe accountabilityframework and modalities of Bank supportto country circumstances

IDA'Ssupport through the RRSP is a response to Government demands to align donor support inorder to lower
transaction cost for the government and to harmonize the policy dialogue along with the other donors around the
I-PRSP and its priorities, as well as the accountability framework for budget support. Identification, pre-appraisal
and appraisal are aligned with the enhanced HIPC process. Only reforms truly owned by the government,
however sensitive, have beenretained inthe program.

Principle4: Chooseonly actions criticalfor achieving resultsas conditionsfor disbursement

The Bank's policy matrix uses a limited set of six conditions which function as prior actions for disbursement.
The chosen policy measures were identifiedjointly with the Government as well as the other partners to ensure a
critical contribution to the Government's reform program and to prepare the terrain for future donor assistance
through the budget. Conditionality i s focused only on critical operational steps which would move the
Government's reform agenda forward. Additionally, five actions have been selected for identifying progress and
the consolidation of reforms that would justify future budget support. The conditionality is also typically
coordinatedwith the programthe Government discusses with the IMF.

Principle 5: Conduct transparentprogress reviews conducive topredictable and performance-based financial
support

The EGSC monitors and evaluates progress made with regard to policy implementation and conducts twice-
annual review sessions. These sessions are chaired by the President, supported by representatives o f the
administration, the donors and civil society. The principal results as well as a summary o f the discussions are
documented and publicly available. In addition, since mid-2007 the newly-resuscitated post o f Auditor General
has providedan independent review o f actions o f the Executive for the Legislature.




                                                       31

                       D.     ANTICIPATED RESULTSOFTHE PROGRAM

5.23    The program targets the underlying structure for long-term reforms. Within this
structure, there are specific results that are expected before the grant closing date o f
September 30,2008. These include:

    a. Liberia is current with its main official creditors following the HIPC Decision Point;
    b. The Liberia Expenditure Control and Accounting Program is operational in
        the Ministry o f Finance and the Bureau o f the Budget;
    C.  Liberia continues to qualify as a candidate for the Extractive Industries
        Transparency Initiative;
    d. Amendments to the Public Procurement and Concessions Act and a new
        Public Finance Act have been submitted to the Legislature;
    e. Regulations, manuals and instructions to implement the PPCA have been
        published;
    f. A comprehensive Civil Service Reform strategy has been approved by
        Cabinet andpublished;
    5   Audits targeting the agencies and ministries posing the largest fiduciary and
        financial risk have been produced for FY05-06andFY06-07; and
    h. A revisedNational Investment Code no longer includes provisions for ad hoc
        tax incentives to individuals and firms.


                         6.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION


                                 A.    COUNTRYOWNERSHIP

6.1     The proposed operation is fully supported and owned by the authorities as indicated
in the Government's Letter of Development Policy. The specific reforms it supports are
critical elements o f the government strategy as put forward inthe government's I-PRSP and
have been strongly promoted and advanced by both the President and Minister o f Finance in
international fora. The EGSC, which is the steering committee for GEMAP, includes
representatives selected by civil society to represent its interests and to guarantee the public
nature o f GEMAP proceedings, as does the GEMAP technical team. The I-PRSP i s the result
of a participatory process with the public and with key stakeholders. However, initial efforts
have not reached all social groups, and a deeper and more local participatory process i s
currently underway in preparation o f the full PRS which i s to be completed in 2008. The
participatory process for the plannedWorld Bank Country Assistance Strategy will be linked
closely with this program.

                                B.     FIDUCIARY   ASSESSMENT

6.2     The budgetary and financial management processes o f the Government o f Liberia
require strengthening, and fiduciary standards need further development to ensure effective
disbursemento f funds through the budget for their intendedpurpose. The largest component


                                             32

o f the proposed grant would be used for the reimbursement o f a bridge loan used to clear
World Bank arrears, with payment to the outside party providing that loan, and so it will be
implemented outside the normal budget process. Regarding budget support, while much has
been done under GEMAP and the Bank's assistance in procurement, and while Bank-
financed technical assistance from the RMUis expected to assist inpayroll reforms that the
government intends to finance with these resources, it is expected that the analytical results
o f the PEMFAR (para. 4.3) will provide a path forward for additional reforms and capacity
buildingand greater transparency andaccountability inbudget execution.

6.3       Arrears clearance with the World Bank is part o f the process towards the Decision
Point (DP) under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. Inmid-2006 the structure o f Liberia's debt
was as given inAnnex 9; mid-2007 figures are summarized inTable 2.123.Commercial debt
i s still being evaluated by financial and legal experts financed by Switzerland, but appears to
be around US$1.4 billion. Any solution to Liberia's debt problem must be comprehensive.
The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation is financing legal and financial advice
to Liberia for the preparation o f a Commercial Debt Reduction Operation. The World Bank
has confirmed that, upon reaching HIPC Decision Point, Liberia will be technically eligible
for a grant through the Debt ReductionFacility for IDA-Only Countries (the DRF)to finance
the implementation o f such an operation. Such support from the DRF would be conditional
on, among other things, the agreement o f a commercial debt reduction plan between Liberia
and its commercial creditors on terms acceptable to IDA and on the mobilization o f the
necessary co-financing from bilateral donors.

6.4       StrengtheningGovernmentSystems. Under GEMAP, major steps have been taken
to improve public financial management. An international expert maintains co-signing
authority for the interministerial CMC based in the Ministry o f Finance. International
controllers have similar authority at the major revenue-generating SOEs and the Ministry o f
Energy and Mines. Under a memorandum o f understanding, SOE revenues flow through a
special account for each SOE at a single commercial bank where they can be monitored.
These international experts with co-signatory power do not usurp the role o f Liberians, but
confirm that all actions taken are (i) the budget, (ii)funded, and (iii)
                                                within                                              transparently
implemented. However, despite strong and growing donor support during the past three years
and the implementation of procurement reforms, public financial management standards in
Liberia remain weak and country systems are not yet reliable. Budget implementation and
cash management need to be enhanced, an objective supported by World Bank under this
proposed grant and other activities (see above).

6.5       Technical Assistance. The World Bank and African Development Bank provide
technical assistance and training in public financial management to the Ministry o f Finance,
and the U.S. Government to the Bureau o f the Budget; the Government intends to merge the
Bureau into the Ministry.The IMF provides a Chief Administrator to the CBL, and technical
assistance in revenue administration to the Ministry o f Finance. The United States has
assisted with the introduction o f a computerized tax payment system with full accountability
checks at each stage, as well as with technical assistance on the domestic debt. The Swiss


23 Annex 9 figures exclude the impact of the retroactive repricing of IBRD interest; the figures inTable 2.1
reflect this repricing but are estimates based on incomplete reporting from three bilateral creditors.


                                                      33

Agency for Development and Cooperation has financed financial and legal experts on foreign
commercial debt. However, durable gains in transparency, effectiveness o f the financial
management systems, and accountability will require sustained engagement o f Liberia's
international partners insupport o f the Government's reformprocess.

6.6      The World Bank is providing strong support to this process. Under the NTGL,
technical assistance helped the government develop the Public Procurement and Concessions
Act that came into effect in January 2006. As described earlier, technical advisors trained
Ministry o f Finance personnel in financial management. Under the new government, the
RMU established in the Ministry of Finance supports improvements in public financial
management in six main areas: macroeconomics, expenditure management, concessions
review, legal capacity, information technology (IT), and institutional reform. This assistance
helps the government to ensure that appropriate fiduciary standards are applied to provide
reasonable assurance that government resources are used for the intended purposes. An
important objective is to achieve compliance with international standards o f financial
management, including the use o f internationally-recognized accounting, auditing, and
reporting standards enabled by modem technology. In this context, financial management
includes budget formulation, budget execution and reporting, including accounting on a cash
basis, and capture o f some basic accrual information on assets, leading over time to the
possible adoption o f accrual accounting. The World Bank has also provided assistance with
implementationo fthe Public Procurement and Concessions Commission.

6.7      A Project Financial ManagementUnithas beenestablished inthe Ministryo fFinance
to ensure effective implementation and supervision of government-executed projects. This i s
expected to contribute to donor willingness to finance activities through the budget, by
suitably ring-fencing the operation until satisfactory governance procedures have been
implementedandvalidated throughout government. To date, it handles financial flows for the
infrastructure activities under several IDA emergency infrastructure projects, an emergency
health project and a pre-arrears clearance capacity-building project o f the African
Development Bank.

6.8      Data dissemination i s difficult in Liberia, given the cost o f document dissemination.
The Ministry o f Finance has a website, www.mofliberia.org, on which the draft annual
budget, the approved annual budget, and regularly budget execution documents are posted.
After spotty initialcompliance, the SOEs' financial reports are also postedon this website.

                    c.     GRANTADMINISTRATION AND DISBURSEMENT

6.9      Grant amount, conditions and tranching.The recipient is the Republic o f Liberia,
represented by the Ministry o f Finance. The grant is for US$[416.4] million equivalent.
Board discussion o f this grant is contingent upon confirmation from the International
Monetary Fund and the African Development Bank that a satisfactory program for arrears
clearance (including obtaining financing assurances) has been agreed with each o f these two
institutions and that neither institution foresees obstacles to Liberian entry into the HIPC
Initiative. Board approval i s being sought conditional on arrears to the Bank having been
cleared no later than December 31, 2007; Management will inform the Board by this date
regardingthe status o f arrears clearance. This exception to arrears clearance policy under OP


                                               34

13.40 is sought to address the requirement o f the bridge lender to effect an intra-day
transaction, which requires the maximum amount o f time within that day for the process to
be undertaken successfully. The Grant will be released in one tranche following its approval
and notification by the Association o f effectiveness o f the Financing Agreement.

6.10    Disbursement mechanism. Upon approval o f the grant and effectiveness o f the
Financing Agreement, and at the request o f the authorities, the proceeds o f the grant would
be disbursed for direct reimbursement to the institution that extended the bridge loan used to
clear arrears to IBRD and IDA (US$[407.4] million). The remainder US$9 million would be
placed in a deposit account in the name o f the government on terms and conditions
acceptable to IDA, including appropriate protection against set-off, seizure andor
attachment.

6.11 Reportingand accounting.The government has provided irrevocable instructions to
IDA for direct disbursement to the institution that had extended the bridge loan. For the
remainder, the proposed operation will follow IDA'S disbursement procedures for
development policy grants. As a due diligence measure, IDA will obtain confirmation from
the government that all these flows have been accounted for in the country's budget
management system (within 30 days o f disbursement). Disbursement would not be linked to
specific purchases.

6.12    Closingdate:The expected closingdate o fthe Grantwill be September 30,2008.

                               D.    ENVIRONMENTAL         ASPECTS

6.13    Specific policies supported by this operation are not likely to have significant effects
on Liberia's environment, natural resources and forests. The reforms supported aim primarily
to strengthen economic governance, increase transparency and reduce the cumbersomeness
o f government procedures, while further reforms under the program would increase
transparency inextractive industries including forestry as the country's policy agenda inEITI
advances. However, given Liberia's emergence from conflict and lack o f government
capacity, a vast environmental agenda remains. The Bank is supporting steps to strengthen
capacity, notably in collaboration with other partners through the Liberia Forest Initiative,
underits ISNandthrough a variety o finstruments including a LICUS grant, the TFLIB grant
from IBRD surplus, andproposed continuation o f these activities under a technical assistance
project planned in the coming period. 1. In addition, through implementation o f its overall
portfolio, the Bank i s assisting Liberia to build environmental planning and management
capacity inkey line ministries and agencies, notably the Environment ProtectionAgency, the
Forest Development Authority and the Ministry o f Lands, Mines and Energy. Associated
with other project activities the Bank is helpingto buildthe capacity o fthe Ministry o fPublic
Works and the Liberia Water and Sewerage Corporation, in tandem with the scaling up o f
investments inthe sectors for which they are responsible.

                            E.      POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACT

6.14    The grant would support the resolution o f Liberia's arrears to IBRD and IDA, failing
which continued full-scale financial support begun on a pre-arrears clearance basis from IDA


                                             35

would be untenable. This reengagement would contribute to a resumption o f the international
community's social and economic development activities in Liberia, which in turn i s
expected to help improve a fragile security situation and ease tensions inthe region. It would
assist the Government in moving to the HIPC Decision Point, enabling it to access interim
debt relief.

6.15    There are likely and significant distributional effects, but these are positive through
improved public financial management and targeting o f social assistance. Specifically,
improving the capacity o f the State to implement its budget priorities and strengthening o f
public financial management would enhance efficiency, transparency and accountability in
public resource use, and increase the country's absorption capacity for external resources.
The grant would also help fund the provision o f basic public services with a highbeneficial
impact on the poor inthe period immediately after arrears clearance. IDA support inthe form
of this operation would have an important signaling role and serve as a catalyst for other
donors to increase and accelerate their support to Liberia. Research on the experience o f
post-conflict countries24shows that failure to continue high levels o f support during the first
five years o f peace i s associated with relapse into conflict. Experience has also shown that
the window o f opportunity for eliciting extraordinary donor support for a country emerging

6.16    This one-tranche operation would provide financing to clear a bridge loan for the
clearance of Liberia's arrears to the World Bank, assist the government in meeting foreign
exchange requirements in the period leading to the HIPC Completion Point and provide-
fiscal space in the budget. The government's fiscal program supported by this operation i s
aimed at W h e r improving public financial management. Monitoring and evaluation o f
budget expenditures will continue as part o fthis operation, andthe Bankwill also continue to
monitor and provide technical support for the implementation o f the broader Government
reform program under the I-PRSP Pillar 11. Other activities financed under the LICUS and
TFLIB grants, as well as activities financed by the EC, USAID and DFID address the
adequacy o f budget execution and monitoring. The IMF i s engaged inregular monitoring o f
government revenues and expenditures.

                                  G.       R I S K S AND RISK MITIGATION

6.17    In the current environment of a country emerging from conflict, the proposed
operation presents significant country and fiduciary risks.
6.18    Security risk. The new administration is assured the continued support o f the UNand
other partners in maintaining security, reforming the armed forces, rebuildinga police force
free o f factional organization, and reinserting ex-combatants into civilian life. However,
regional conflict, which recently eased, continues to threaten to return in Liberia, C8te

d'Ivoire or Sierra Leone, as well as in portions o f neighboring Guinea. The decades o f
conflict, conflict-driven emigration, and the heritage o f corruption have drained the pool o f
basic domestic competence and integrity required for economic management; even a modest
increase inregional conflict or domestic criminality would threaten the return o f the diaspora
whose skills are required to re-launch the private sector and build government competence.
Without this the reform i s unlikely to succeed. The continued commitment o f the UNand the
international community i s requiredto mitigate this risk.
6.19    Political risk. The opposition-led legislature covers a broad range o f interests, and its
contribution to economic management i s not yet known. This can be mitigated only by the
continued intensive attention o f the international community to budgetprocesses, through the
LRDC and the EGSC, and broad-based frequent consultations with stakeholders to
strengthen the case for reforms and Government's commitment to them.
6.20    Macroeconomic risk. The prospects o f a deterioration o f Liberia's macroeconomic
performance represent an important risk to the operation, particularly ifthis causes a delay in
the HIPC process. The continuation o f the current economic recovery will depend critically
on the government's adherence to a medium-term macroeconomic framework elaborated
jointly with the IMF and the World Bank. The macroeconomic risk would be mitigated by
close economic monitoring and coordination by the Bank, the IMF and other donors, and an
acceleration o f the HIPC timetable, provided that overall performance is fully satisfactory on
the part o f the government. Following the Decision Point, there is also a serious risk o f
falling back into arrears with all creditors, giventhe scale o f the outstanding debt, depending
on the response o f the Paris Club and commercial creditors. With respect to IDA, this risk i s
mitigated by the inclusion in this operation o f resources for budget support. Furthermore,
fiture IDA assistance in support o f government's continuous reform efforts are likely to
ensure that overall flows from IDA would be strongly positive. Lastly, with the UNSC's
provisional lifting o f the timber and diamond sanctions (diamond exports resumed in
September 2007, following adherence to the Kimberly Accord, while logging may be
possible as early as the dry season in early 2008), and the continued improvement in the
efficiency o f revenue collection by the Ministry o f Finance, it is likely that revenue
mobilization will improve and reduce the burden o f debt service to creditors. However, to
mitigate the risk o f default, the World Bank and IMF will continue to provide leadership to
coordinate andsynchronize broader support from donors.
6.21    Fiduciary risk. Under this Operation, most o f the resources are programmed to
permit the clearance o f IBRD and IDA arrears under standard IBRD and IDA procedures.
Thus, ina strict sense, government fiduciary risk is limited.However, there is a fiduciary risk
from failure to suppress corruption or failure o f the government to make effective and
efficient use o f the fiscal space made available by arrears clearance and budget support.
There is also a risk that incremental increases ingovernment revenues may be reallocated by
the legislature according to its own priorities outside the budget process and possibly outside
GEMAP controls.
6.22    Despite the new Public Procurement and Concessions Act and the presence o f
international controllers provided under GEMAP, financial controls require further
strengthening, particularly following the devolution o f procurement to line ministries under
the Act. The improvement in fiduciary standards is a central objective o f the program and
continued IDA assistance inpublic financial management and public administrationwill help


                                              37

improve budget execution processes over time. The PEMFAR, including a CFAA, will
identify areas in particular need of remedial action, and the preparation of an Action Plan,
jointly with the government, will address them. Technical assistance provided bythe RMUis
expected to facilitate the amelioration o f fiduciary standards. The presence o f an international
adviser with co-signing power for Cash Management Committee decisions is expected to
hrther mitigate the remaining risks that these resources are improperly used. The
participation o f civil society inthe EGSCbroadens andmakes more transparentthe oversight
hnctionfor this process o freform o fpublic financial management.
6.23    Implementation Risk. Lack o f capacity poses a significant risk to the success o f the
operation. Because o f insufficient capacity, fiscal controls have led to delays in execution o f
the budget and under-spending. Some current Bank projects are implemented by UN
agencies and NGOs, but for larger donor flows to be administered through the budget,
significant improvements in government capacity are necessary. This i s being addressed by
the Bank-financed public financial management program and by efforts underway with the
support o f the donor community to institutea senior executive service as part o f broader civil
service reform.

     Liberia's Letter of DevelopmentPolicy

     DearMr.Zoellick,

     Inthe twenty-two months since the inauguration o f President EllenJohnson Sirleaf, Liberia has
     made significant progress in initiating the process o f reconstruction and development. We face
     enormous challenges stemming from 15 years of civil war and gross economic mismanagement.
     Overcoming these challenges will take many years o f concerted efforts. But we have taken the
     first difficult steps on the road to recovery. With the continued efforts o f the Liberian people and
     strong support o f the international community, we believe we are on the path to rebuildinga new
     Liberia based on democracy, transparency, accountability, and economic opportunity for all.
     This letter describes some o f the challenges we face, the most important steps we have taken to
     beginto redress them, and key policies we planto pursue inthe months ahead.

     1. Economic Context & Vision

     The damage and negative consequences of the conflict were enormous. Commercial and
     productive activities ceased as warlords looted and vandalized the resources o f the country. The
     result was a precipitous decline in economic output and a rapid spread and deepening of poverty.
     GDP per capita, in 2005 prices, declined from US$1,269 in 1980 to US$163 in 2005. Total
     exports in 1978 o f about US$486 milliondeclined to about US$104 million in2004. The decline
     was across the board: agricultural production dropped shsrply as people fled their farms and the
     supporting infrastructure collapsed, mining and timber activity nearly ceased, rubber plantations
     closed, manufacturing essentially stopped, and services ground to a halt. The economy finally
     stabilized and began to rebound in 2004. Growth reached 5.3 percent in 2005 and 8 percent in
     2006.




                                                       43

 The government's budgetary resources collapsed. Total government expenditure did not exceed
 U S 8 5 million between-2000 and 2005, translating into spending per capita o f only about
 US$25, one o f the lowest levels inthe world. At the same time, years o f mismanagement have

 left Liberia with a huge external debt burden, mostly as a result o f large borrowing and
 expenditures inthe late 1970s and 1980s and steady accumulation o f arrears since then. Liberia's
 total debt i s estimated at about US$4.5 billion, equivalent to well over 800 percent o f GDP and
 2,000 percent o f exports. The recently-validated domestic debt and arrears are estimated at about
 US$320 million, the bulk o f which i s owed to the banking system (including the CBL).

 Basic infrastructure was badly damaged by the conflict. Many roads are impassable, which
 seriously constrains peace building efforts; contributes significantly to weak economic activity in
 agriculture, timber, and mining; and undermines the delivery o f basic health and education
 services. Consolidating the peace, revitalizing the economy, and reducing poverty will be next to
 impossible without a significant improvement in roads. There was no electricity or piped water
 in the country for 15 years until the new Government ,turned on some water and electricity in
 Monrovia in July 2006. Schools, hospitals, and clinics are badly damaged, and most government
buildings are dilapidated: Of the 325 health facilities operating before the war, about 95 percent
were partially or wholly destroyed, and there were at war's end only about 50 Liberian
physicians to cover the nation's public health needs - one for every 60,000 Liberians. Over half
of Liberian children and youth are esti.mated to be out o f school. The war created a generation
with very limited exposure to formal education, with the destruction o f about 70 percent o f the
school buildings.

The decimation o f the economy has led to very highlevels o f unemployment. With the collapse
o f so many sectors, ex-combatants and returning refugees and internally displaced persons are
struggling to find work. One o f the most important challenges facing the government i s to create
opportunities for employment as quickly as possible for as many people as possible through a
combination o f the revitalization o f agriculture, rebuilding o f infrastructure, community-based
revitalization projects, and the resurgence o f natural resource-based economic activities.

About half o f the Liberian population lives in rural areas, and over 80 percent o f those are
subsistence farmers with little or no cash income. However, many o f those farmers were
displaced during the conflict, and are now returning after many years to situations o f uncertain
land tenure and a lack o f seeds, fertilizers, and tools. The UNDP estimated in 2001 that 86
percent o f rural households are poor, and 64 percent live in severe poverty. The situation is
similar in small and medium-sized t o h s that once relied on rubber and mining activities. In
Monrovia the situation is little better, with about 50 percent o f households living inpoverty and
22 percent in severe poverty.

Moving forward, the main objectives o f our policy framework are to continue strengthening
macroeconomic stability, increase economic growth andjob creation, reduce poverty, and make
substantial progress toward achieving the MDGs. The government's policy framework is
informed by its I-PRSP. The full PRSP will be finalized by mid-2008.




                                                 44

 We hope that continued progress in strengthening key institutions and implementing prudent
 macroeconomic policies will attract substantial financial and technical donor support, as well as
 significant amounts o f foreign direct investment.Based on a resumption o f logging following the
 lifting of UN sanctions on timber exports in late2006 and significant investment in iron ore
 mining, for 2008-201 0 we aim to achieve annual average real GDP growth o f around 12percent.
 We also aim to contain inflation in single digits.

 A strong economy with robustjob growth and a vibrant private sector is critical. Inthe short-to-
 medium-term, this i s best achieved by restoring the traditional engines o f the Liberian economy
-rubber, timber, miningand cash crops to full growth potential. Revitalizingagriculture is
 among the government's highest priorities, as it provides livelihoods for the majority o f
 Liberians and is essential for improving nutrition and reducing poverty. Over time, the
 government hopes to attract new investment in export-oriented manufacturing and services.
 Achieving these goals will require rebuilding and revitalizing both physical and social
 infrastructurethroughout the country.

2. Our Vision for a New Liberia

The government's key objectives are to build a new Liberiannation that is peaceful, secure, and
prosperous - to work, inthe words o f President Sirleaf, so that "Every Liberian, no matter where
they live, no matter who they are, should have the foundation and opportunity necessary to
achieve their goals and live long productive lives." Achieving our goals will require policies
aimed at both economic recovery and political stability that are mutually reinforcingand serve to
ensure that our future growth does not recreate the pattern o f the past, achieving instead greater
distributional equity.

Development cannot proceed without basic peace and security. The drive to human development
inthe new Liberia must be based on the total elimination of insecurity, restoration of peace and
reconciliation as well as the protection o f humanrights. Additionally, it will require the building
of a new security and police force that i s sufficiently strong to keep the peace while resting
firmly under the democratic civilian control.

A key element to securing these goals is restoring and.strengthening basic human rights and
further empowering the Liberian people. The new Liberia will do away with the divisions,
marginalization and exclusion o fthe past. Political power will be decentralized and shifted to the
counties and communities, which will be empowered to effectively participate in decision
making and to take control o f local issues and development process. The goal i s to usher in an
inclusive and highly part`icipatory democracy in which rights are respected; people are engaged
inthe governance process; national resources are usedfor the benefito fthe people; and effective
institutions o f governance are built.These will require humanand institutional capacity building
to ensure good governance, an effective state, and proper checks and balances among the three
arms of governance.




                                                 45

 The Government's reconstruction and development strategy is based on four pillars:
     1. Expanding peace and security,
    2. Revitalizing economic activity,
    3. Strengthening governance and the rule o f law, and
    4. Rebuilding infrastructure and providing basic services.

Actions in each o f the four pillars are mutually reinforcing. National security i s a pre-requisite
for real economic progress with substantial impact on poverty. At the same time, peace and
national security will be severely threatened if chronic poverty continues to rise. Sustainable
peace will largely depend uponthe ability to deliver basic social services throughout the country.
Similarly, without basic infrastructure the private investments needed to fuel growth will not be
forthcoming. Governance and the rule o f law provide the institutional base for strong economic
performance and poverty alleviation, and the justice that i s needed to ensure that grievances are
settled through dialogue within the political system, as opposedto violence.

The remainder o f this letter describes the key actions we have taken in each of these four areas.
These actions provide the foundation for our efforts going forward and are reflected in our
InterimPoverty Reduction Strategy (I-PRS) under implementation. We are currently preparing
our full Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), which will carry forward these broad themes and
definepolicy actions and goals through mid-2011.

3. Key Actions to Date & Priorities for Future Action

ExpandingPeace and Security

We have made good progress in deactivating former security personnel, demobilizing ex-
combatants, and rebuildingnew security forces. We have hlly completed the process o f making
severance and retirement payments to former armed forces personnel. We also deactivated a
large number o f the almost 1,000-strong Special Security Services (SSS) personnel. The
government places very high priority 6n peacefully re-integrating ex-combatants, and we have
successfully disarmed, demobilized, and reintegrated many thousands o f these individuals. We
have facilitated the return o f refugees from neighboring countries, worked to reintegrate tens o f
thousands o f internally displaced people, and provided support to the returnees through health,
water, training, and employment programs.

A key challenge going forward is to create new, professional, and accountable security forces.
We have initiated the recruitment and training o f new armed forces and are aiming to train 5,500
new forces by June 2008. We have begun the process o f rebuilding and strengthening the
Liberian National Police (LNP) through completion o f severance payments to non-qualified
police personnel, recruitment o f new qualified personnel, re-equipping and logistical support to
the LNP, and restructuring and reform.




                                                 46

 Moving forward, and as we prepare for the eventual withdrawal o f the United Nations
 peacekeepers, we plan to maintain an effective security system that is capable o f defending and
 protecting Liberia and promoting domestic and sub-regional peace and security. We wish to
 create a secure environment conducive-to personal security, business activity, economic growth,
 and sustainable development.

 It is important to ensuring the peace that our national security agencies are present throughout
the country. Representatives of the security institutions are increasingly being deployed
throughout the counties and towns o f Liberia to provide protection, preserve the peace, and
respond to other security needs o f citizens.

We plan to place special emphasis on the protection o f women and children, and encourage
women's participation in national security functions. The dedicated "Women and Children
Protection Section" o f the Liberia National Police will be strengthened to ensure effective and
professional response to the violation o f women's `and childrens' rights; it will include
conducting specialized training for juvenile officers and those dealing with Gender Based
Violence. Women will bt encouraged to form part o f every security institution with the goal o f
having at least 20% women's participation inall national security institutions.

Economic Revitalization

Our strategy for economic revitalization has two basic prongs: strengthening the overall
management o f government finances, and establishing the basis for a strong rebound in
productive economic activities. The Government's short-term objectives have been to stabilize
the economy, create jobs, and restore the government's credibility in using the country's scarce
resourcesefficiently and effectively.

To guide its actions, the Government quickly finalized and embarked on a Staff-Monitored
Program (SMP) with the IMF in February 2006 in order to strengthen economic management
and establish the basis for further progress under a successor Fund program and eventual debt
reliefunder the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. As noted by the IMF, the Government has established
an encouraging record of.policy implementation under the SMP, which i s equivalent to an upper-
credit tranche IMF-supported program.

We aim to promote accelerated and shared economic growth that i s underpinned by a stable
macroeconomic environment. To that end we will ensure that the evolving policy framework
increases productivity and promotes growth and development in the key productive sectors o f
forestry, agriculture, and mining and implement growth-supportive infrastructure policies and
programs for roads, energy, telecommunications, and water and sanitation. We will also work to
create a favorable environment for higher levels of private investment, both local and foreign.




                                              47

 Since taking office, we have implemented a number o f policies to support economic
 reconstruction and development, Supported by a recovery in rubber production, construction
 activities, and the impact o f a large donor presence, real'GDP growth is estimated to have risen
 from 2.6 percent in 2004 to about 8 percent in2006, after having declined by over 30 percent in
 2003.

The exchange rate o f tlye Liberian dollar to the U.S. dollar depreciated by 4.8 percent in the
twelve months to endJune 2007. Year-on-year inflation (as measured by the new Harmonized
CPI) was 12.4 percent in June 2007,.compared with 12.0 percent in January; excluding the
impact o f volatile food prices, it was 3.9 percent, down from 7.6 percent inJanuary.

Fiscal management improved significantly during the first year and a half o f the government's
term in office as a number o f actions were taken to increase revenues and to strengthen public
expenditure management. On the revenue side, these included: (i)        computerization o f the tax
payment (tax receipt) system; (ii)increasing the penalty for not undertaking pre-shipment
inspection;    (iii)strengthening customs administration and reducing exemptions;              (iv)
strengthening the Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU); (v) redefining the base for the goods and services
tax on imports in line with the provisions o f the Liberia Revenue Code (LRC); (vi) raising the
rate of selective tax on services on restaurants from 3.5 to 7 percent; and (vii) increasing the
excise tax on beer and cigarettes, and eliminating the differentiation between imported and
domestic products in thk application o f excise taxes. As a result, actual revenue collection,
excluding grants, in fiscal year 2006/07 was 74 percent higher than in 2005/06, with an
approximate doubling intaxes on both international trade and on income and profits.

We also reorganized domestic tax administration along taxpayer segmentation lines by
establishing small- and medium taxpayer units, inaddition to the existing large taxpayer unit. In
the context of our program to strengthen coordination of budget implementation and to ensure
that the budget is implemented as planned, we have submitted legislation to formally merge the
Bureauo f the Budgetwith the Ministryo f Finance, as well as legislation to limit the discretion o f
the government to change budget allocations between ministries and agencies without approval
of the legislature to a cumulative total o f 30 percent. Pending the integration o f the Bureau o f
the Budget into the Ministry of Finance, we have significantly strengthened the role of the
National BudgetCommittee, which i s chaired by the Minister o f Finance.

On the expenditure side, we introduced, with donor support, a commitment control system to
ensure that allotments to line ministries are in line with available revenues. We also introduced
revised public procurement guidelines to ensure that public procurement is transparent, and
adheres to prudent standards. Furthermore, the Ministry o f Finance required all line ministries
and agencies to prepare prioritized monthly cash plans to ensure that expenditure cuts can be
made in the event o f revenue shortfalls. Expenditure approvals, though, lagged revenues during
the first ten months of FY 2006/2007, reflecting the late legislative approval o f the 2006/07
budget, continuing challenges inimplementing the new public procurement and concessions act,




                                                48

 and capacity constraints in line ministries. But a significant acceleration in spending during the
 last two months o f the year allowed us to fully implement the budget on a commitment basis.

 An important accomplishment has been to ensure the timely payment o f civil service salaries
 across the country, and we remain committed to ensuring that all civil servants are paid before
 the end of each month.

 We have made substantial progress on financial management. We established sound public
financial management and budgeting systems through the establishment o f a fully functioning
Cash Management Committee at MOF to ensure that adequate cash balances are available before
any payment is approved. We have completed the process o f verifying the amount o f outstanding
domestic debt and have begun to implement our domestic debt resolution strategy agreed under
the SMP. We are working to establish a domestic debt trust fund to ensure the timely and
consistent payment o f domestic debt inthe mediumterm.

The Central Bank o f Liberia (CBL) continued to make progress in strengthening the financial
system as well as its own internal finances. The CBL has maintained price stability, and resumed
the program o f regular foreign exchange auctions. It has also substantially increased its foreign
reserve holdings, and continued efforts to strengthen the supervision o f domestic banks and
strengthen undercapitalized banks. Inthis regard a Manual for the Reconstruction, Closing and
Liquidation o f Insolvent Banks was developed, and training was provided to supervision staff. A
Compliance Committee was established to ensure that banks comply with laws, regulations and
directives, and comprehensive on-site inspections were completed for two banks. Progress was
made in improving the capitalization o f the banking system, and by end-May 2007, the capital
adequacy ratio of the system exceeded 8 percent.

Simultaneously, the government significantly advanced key components of the Governance and
Economic Management Assistance Program (GEMAP). The GEMAP was conceived in 2005 as
a partnership between the Government o f Liberia (GOL), and the international community to
improve public financial governance, enhance transparency and accountability, and lay a
foundation for a sustainable peace. Under GEMAP, several internationally-recruited financial
experts were placed in key institutions and given co-signing authority, and major efforts have
beenlaunched to strengthenfinancial oversight and basic fiduciary systems.

Interms of stimulating a rebound ineconomic activity, our initial focus was on restoring natural
resource-based industries including timber, mining, and minerals. One o f President Sirleafs first
actions after her inauguration was to cancel all existing concession contracts, and initiate review
of all contracts and concessions. The UN rightly imposed sanctions on timber and diamonds
during the war, since these operations had been taken over by the warlords to finance the
conflict. But abuse by the warlords and these resulting sanctions are estimated to have lowered
GDP by 31%, and resulted in losses o f 25,000 jobs intimber and 12,000 jobs in diamonds. We
have worked diligently to improve the management and oversight o f the timber sector, and the
UNhas since removed those sanctions. We are currently inthe process o f achieving Kimberly
certification inorder to allow the export o f diamonds following the removal of sanctions onthis




                                                 49

 Commodity as well. The process for the bidding and negotiation for the restart o f mining,
 rubber, and oil palm plantations is in an advanced stage, and in some cases (such as mining)
 productive work has already begun.

 In particular we successfully concluded the renegotiation of a major new concession with
 Arcelor Mittal Steel for our largest ore mine, in which the company pledged to make new
 investments totaling upwards o f US$1 billion. We plan to implement a model of transparent,
 public natural resource agreements in the future, and to thit end are engaging actively in the
 Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), under which Liberia i s now a candidate
 country. We are resolutely committed to ensuring that the revenues from Liberia's extractive
 industries benefit all Liberians.

 We are taking vigorous steps to revitalize agriculture, which is critical for creating economic
opportunities for returning refugees and IDPs, ex-combatants, and other Liberians trying to
recover from the war. Agricultural incomes in the crop sector plummeted in recent years, with
productivity for cereals falling from 1290 kgs/ha in 1998 to 917 kgsha in 2005. As a first step,
we distributed to over 32,884 beneficiaries a total of 41,500 pieces o f tools, 20.5 MT o f seed rice
and 223 packs o f vegetable seed. This effort i s being expanded significantly during the current
dry season in preparation for the coming rains. We have also taken initial steps to rebuild our
agriculture extension system.

A revitalized agriculture sector that contributes to shared, inclusive and sustainable economic
development and growth, providing food security and nutrition, employment and income, and
measurable poverty reduction for all Liberians is a key goal o f this government. We aim to
enhance agricultural productivity and increase production o f staple food and export commodities
particularly by smallholder & female producers, and improve access to food through available
and affordable factors o f production, competitive markets and strengthened social safety nets.
Doing this will require the establishment o f effective supporting institutions that provide needed
services, the enabling environment, and monitoring mechanisms necessary to encourage growth
anddevelopment.

We will work to facilitate food security and improve nutritional status o f vulnerable groups,
especially pregnant and lactating women and children under five, and work to create greater
opportunities for agricultural trade and value addition through better infrastructure and higher
value chains. This will be pursued in a framework o f open, transparent and accountable natural
resource utilization and governance that facilitates inclusive growth and development consistent
with law and best practices.

The program articulated in the I-PRSP confirms the private sector's role as the main engine for
growth. Measures to support the private sector include maintaining macroeconomic stability,
strengthening economic governance, and addressing impediments to private sector development,
The Government intends to progressively address impediments identified inthe FIAS analysis of
the investment climate, including (i)the legal andregulatory incentive structure that has ledto a
large informal sector, (ii)energy supply, (iii)access to finance, (iv) land ownership and tenure,
(v) tax policy, and (vi) administrative and regulatory issues. To integrate Liberiafurther into the




                                                 50

 world economy and promote economic efficiency, the Government will initiate a program o f
 comprehensive tariff reform to adopt the ECOWAS common external tariff.

 The World Bank Group (particularly FIAS and IFC) and other partners are providing assistance
 on the investment climate. We also aim to promote labor market policy reforms that support
 private sector growth and economic development with due regard for international labor
 standards. Inthat regard we are working on revised labor legislation. We will work to create a
 conducive trade and commercial environment. We were pleased to have been included in the
IFC's Doing Business Survey for the first time in 2008 and intend to use the results to
benchmark ourselves and focus on the areas needing the biggest improvement. In addition to
submitting a new investment code to the legislature in September 2007, we intend to pursue
other recommendations o f the World Bank Group's Investment Climate Team in an effort to
improve our business environment.

Our ongoing efforts to strengthen the management o f government finances and increase
                                                         '
transparency will continue. Specifically, we are developing a medium-term strategy (2-3 years)
o f PFM reforms that could be supported by donors; the recent IMF P F M and World Bank
PEMFAR missions, with their recommended action plan, will play a crucial role in this regard.
The General Auditing Commission is expected to conduct its first audit inthe coming months,

which should provide crucial feedback and accountability checks on government spending and
reporting. We planto develop and submit a new public finance law for legislative consideration,
with the view to consolidating, modernizing, and makingmore transparent the disparate pieces
o f relevant legislation now ineffect. With these ongoing improvements inPFMthe government
expects donors to begin offering budget support, thereby allowing for the more efficient
allocation and coordination o f resources to meet poverty reduction objectives.

On the expenditure side, short-run efforts will focus on further increasing the efficiency o f the
expenditure approval process while strictly adhering to the commitment control system designed
to ensure that allotments do not exceed available revenues and procurement guidelines are being
followed. To this end, we will amend the existing Procurement Act and issue implementing
regulations.   We will also continue efforts to improve cash and procurement planning in
ministries and agencies. We will target improving budget preparation, implementation and
reporting capacity in the Ministry o f Finance and line ministries, as well as strengthening cash
management and internal-audit, with a view to ultimately windingdown the activities o f the Cash
Management Committee. We plan to put in place an Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS) with the support o f the World Bank to further improve fiscal
management and expenditure controls. .

Strengtheningthe monetary policy framework remains essential to meeting inflation objectives.
In this context, we will continue to work to strengthen the available policy tools for liquidity
management, while considering our policy options in managing the current dual currency
arrangement. We will also continue to focus on strengtheningthe domestic banking sector to




                                              51

improve private sector access to credit, and to develop a modern national payments system to
support economic revitalization.

In that regard we plan to review and harmonize existing financial legislation and where
necessary, propose new legislation to strengthenthe stability, soundness, and transparency o f the
financial system, and facilitate access to credit.

Liberia's national statistical capacity is minimal due to years o f civil war. The availability of
accurate and timely economic data has been adversely affected. With significant activity in the
informal sector, and only limited information on agriculture and the services sector, both the
level and rate o f growth in real GDP may be underestimated. We will therefore focus on
strengthening the capacity o f the Liberian Institute for Statistics and Geo-Information Services
(LEGIS), developing a comprehensive medium-term national statistical plan, and begin
implementing key elements o f that plan with the support o f donors.

Governance & Rule of Law

The multiple crises that besieged the Liberian nation over the last quarter century from war,
mismanagement, human rights abuse, to the deepening o f poverty can be blamed largely on bad
governance. Since coming into office, the current government has taken a range o f steps to
strengthen key institutions to promote good governance and the rule o f law. To begin with, all
Ministers publicly declared their assets and published them in the local newspapers. We have
also developed a new code o f conduct for all public officials. Court proceedings have been
undertaken against those-accused o f corruption and malfeasance, a practice that we will seek to
continue. The government has developed and is implementing a new anti-corruption strategy,
including submitting legislation to create an anti-corruption commission, which is currently
pending legislative approval.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established to account for atrocities
committed from April 1979 to October 2003 and to foster reconciliation within and between
Liberia's polarized communities. The Governance Reform Commission (GRC) i s working to
restore and reform institutions o f government and to ensure democratic self-governance that is
inclusive, participatory, andjust; to that end the GRC has produced studies on Judicial and Land
Reforms. The Independent National Commission on Human Rights has been established to fight
the culture o f impunity and protect and promote human rights, including economic, social and
cultural rights. The University o f Liberia has established a Center for Conflict Transformation
(CCT) which aims to undertake research, offer courses and give policy advice. As well, the
capacity o f Liberia's civil society in this area i s noticeably increasing; there are at least 20
national NGOs that focus on peace-building initiatives and conflict sensitive development issues
across the country, ad well as many faith-based organizations and community-based
organizations that undertakepeace buildingand conflict resolution ina variety o f forms.

The destruction o f public institutions is a critical constraint on which the Government will be
focusing attention. Ongoing reform efforts will be deepened to ensure that the public




                                                  52

 administration i s transformed into an agent for change, development and socio-economic
transformation. Comprehensive civil service reform will be a key element o f our efforts to
 strengthen institutions and buildcapacity.

The finalization o f a strategy to this effect i s planned for March 2008, including pay and
compensation reform. The Government i s meanwhile deepening its efforts at vetting the payroll
to remove irregularities (including ghost employees), eliminating redundant staff, and increasing
staff compensationfrom its previous grossly inadequate, level.

Building civil service capacity is critical to improved governance. The Resource Management
Unit (RMU) withinthe Ministryo f Finance i s implementing training programs for financial staff
o f government ministries and agencies and training a batch o f 29 university graduates over a
two-year period. These graduates will evolve into a multidisciplinary group that will implement
the reformagenda inthe line ministriesand counties.

Looking forward, we plan to progressively decentralize governance, devolving decision making
and implementation to local entities.       The government is currently studying how best to
implement a decentralization strategy and design local governance systems, and increasingly
give financial control to entities outside Monrovia as their capacity develops, beginningwith the
county development funds currently being implemented.

With regard to land tenure reform, we wish to define and establish appropriate laws and public
regulations on public land acquisition and usage and to establish and operationalize a framework
for managing land distribution and land disputes. Part o f this will be the establishment o f a land
commission to oversee this process.

The administration o f the justice and prosecution system will be strengthened, with the goal of
transparent, equitable, and swift judicial resolutions. A Bureau o f Corrections and Rehabilitation
will also be created and adequately resourced to function effectively. Legal aid systems will be
strengthened to ensure adequate representation o f all defendants.

A law reform commission will be established to review existing statutory and customary law and
propose amendments to ensure consistency between laws and compliance with international
treaty obligations. Work will be undertaken to improve the quality o f legal education and the
National Bar Association will be strehgthened. We will work to establish an effective and
independent Judiciary, enhancing the delivery capacities o f courts throughout the country. We
will also consider establishing a Judicial Training Institute.

We are working to strengthen the protection and promotion o f human rights, including the
establishment o f an effective and operational Independent Commission for Human Rights
(INCHR) that will provide technical support to lead ministries in their obligations o f treaty
reporting and involving civil society in the process o f treaty body implementation, monitoring
and reporting.

Infrastructure and Basic Services

The government inherited an infrastructure that was ina total state o f disrepair as a result o f the
war and years o f neglect. Roads, telecommunications, the power system, water and sanitation,
schools, and health care facilities were mostly destroyed. The task before the Government is to
rehabilitate the infrastructure and social services in order to create the conditions needed to
achieve broad-based growth and poverty reduction. Health, education, and other services must
have a particular focus on youth and women, who too often are marginalized from such services.
Health activities will need to focus on malaria, HIV/AIDS, diarrhea, and other major diseases
that kill so many Liberians. Increasing school enrollments, offering more and higher quality
training opportunities, and providing more recreation and sports activities will help improve the
security situation, strengthen the foundation for growthand poverty reduction, and train Liberia's
next generation o f leaders.

Rebuilding the road network is central to achieving our goals o f enhancing security and
revitalizing the economy. Towards that end, we have built bridges and reconditioned a number o f
roads, as well as the international airport. This infrastructure redevelopment will continue into
the future with the help o f the World Bank-administered Multi-Donor Trust Fund which is
currently being established. Over the next few years we plan to construct and rehabilitate 1000
miles o f primary roads and reconstruct and rehabilitate 300 miles o f feeder roads to assist
farmers with delivery o f their products to the market and boost economic empowerment and
growth. We will also work to improve public transport both within Monrovia and between
cities.

It is crucial that we improve facilities and processes at our ports to facilitate trade. We have
worked to develop a `one-stop shop' at the Freeport o f Monrovia in order to expedite the
payment o f import duties and clearance o f goods.        In the near future we are planning to
reorganize and reduce the size o f the National Port Authority's work force. We will also
undertake emergency repairs to port infrastructure with the assistance o f our development
partners pendingthe privatization o f the port through a build-own-transfer arrangement.

We have turned on power and water to parts o f Monrovia for the first time in 15 years, and will
continue to expand electricity in the months ahead. More o f greater Monrovia will have power
in2008. Inthe coming years we planto explore the establishment of a newrural and renewable
Energy Authority and our hydropower potential. Inthat context we are currently undertaking a
feasibility study for the Mount Coffee Hydroelectric Dam, with US Trade Development
Authority support. We plan to increase access to safe drinking water, doubling the number o f
Liberians who have access to safe water to 50% in 2011 and increase access to sanitary human
waste collection and disposal facilities. We also aim to promote the creation o f local Water &
Sanitation (Watsan) committees at the local level nationwide.

 Education i s central to our reconstruction and development program, and plays a central role in
 improved health awareness, human resource development, awareness o f human rights, better
 participation in civic responsibilities, improved gender balance, and productive capacity. The
 Government's plan i s to embark upon policies and enhance investments to improve access to as
 many children as possible and especially from poorest families and to provide skills development
 for adolescents and adults. We will give special attention to implementing the new Girl's
Education Policy and ensuring equal opportunities for girls. The government needs to increase
access by providing new schools where none exist in population centers, reconstructing those
damaged during the war.and making available school materials to ensure that teachers do not
levy unofficial fees from parents. Towards that end, we have started the long process o f
rebuilding schools and bringing them back into operation. We are in the process o f reopening
schools and strengthening school staff around the country. We have implemented free and
compulsory basic primary education nationwide, which has led to markedly increased school
enrollments. Over the next few years we will develop a national education curriculum and
further increase the number and improve the quality of our schools. We planto hrther improve
the quality o f teachers via training and certification, as well as implementingnational testing to
track the performance o f students.

The provision o f basic health and nutrition services is a major priority for the Government. With
assistance from its development partners, the Governmen! will strive to improve the health status
of the population, especially the rural and urbanpoor. We have developed and are implementing
a National Health and Social Welfare Policy and Plan. We have begun to rebuild and re-staff
clinics around the country towards the goal o f ensuring that by December 2008, 70% o f all
health facilities are providing an equitable, affordable and integrated Basic Package of Health
Services (BPHS) to individuals and communities, with particular emphasis on reaching women
and children, especially the poor and vulnerable. We have begun to strengthen the capacity o f
County Health Teams to plan and coordinate health services and improve and ensure the
equitable distribution o f health facilities as international NGOs begin to leave Liberia with the
ebbing o f the humanitarian crisis. The Ministry o f Health has worked to strengthen its financial
management and procurement systems. Our proposal for revitalizing our program to combat
HIV/AIDS was approved by the Global Fundto Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, and the National
AIDS Commission has beenreconstituted andhas begunoperations.

Liberia has a long way to go to recover from the violence and mismanagement o f the war. The
path forward will not be easy. But we have taken the first, most difficult steps. The people o f
Liberia have spoken clearly that they do not want any turning back. We are very grateful for the
significant support that the World Bank has provided over the past two years, notwithstanding
our non-accrual status. We appreciate your continued support for the efforts outlined above and
the next phase ofour strategy, as outlined inthe iPRSP and soonthe PRS.

The World Bank has been and continues to be one of our most important and responsive
development partners.We look forwardto continuing our dialogueand exchange of ideas as we
move forwardinbuilding a new Liberia.

                                                    MonitoredProgram
Press Release No. 07/160
July 13, 2007

The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) met today to discuss the third review o f
performance under Liberia's Staff Monitored Program (SMP)L. Liberia has been implementing an SMP since
February 2006.

Following the Board meeting, John Lipsky, FirstDeputy Managing Director and Acting Chairman, made the
following statement:

"The Executive Board o f the IMF was informed today o f progress in implementing policies under the staff-
monitored program (SMP) for 2007. Despite difficult circumstances, the government has established an
encouraging track record o f policy implementation under their 2007 SMP, which meets the standards
associated with arrangements in the upper credit tranches. Achievements under the SMP have supported a
continued recovery in real GDP growth, relative price and exchange rate stability, and a significant
improvement in public financial management and the financial position o f the Central Bank of Liberia
(CBL).

"Revenue collection in 2006/07 substantially exceeded the budget target. The government also strictly
implemented the interim commitment control system. It will be important to resist any pressures to relax the
interim commitment control system since this i s an integral part o f the government's strategy to prevent the
reemergence o f domestic payments arrears. It i s also important for the government to work closely with the
legislature to ensure passage o fthe 2007/08 budget as soon as possible.

"Raising civil service salaries and wages i s an important step, It is, however important to develop a
comprehensive civil service reform strategy to ensure that future salary increases are sustainable and
consistent with the efficient delivery o f public services.

"It is also important to begin implementation o f the government's recently adopted anticorruption strategy
that provides for establishing an independent anticomption commission. Draft legislation for the
commission's establishment should be submitted to the legislature, and the government seek early
involvement o f development partners in finalizing an operational plan for the commission.

"Liberia's external debt i s unsustainable, and it i s urgent to make progress in moving Liberia onto the path
toward debt relief. This underscores the importance o f mobilizing the necessary financing for arrears
clearance and debt relief for Liberia. It i s important that the IMF be in a position to assist Liberia to
normalize its relations with the internationalcommunity as soon as possible. Fundmanagement has proposed
a financing package that provides a reasonable basis for mobilizing the necessary financing and looks
forward to specific commitments from a wide group o f bilateral contributors to ensure that sufficient
resources will be inplace expeditiously," Mr.Lipsky said.


'A staff monitored program (SMP) is an informal agreementbetween national authorities and Fund staff to monitor the implementation of the
authorities' economic program.

                      ANNEX 8: IMPROVING STATISTICAL INFORMATION


The international partners are helping the Government to restore its capability in collection,
analysis, and reporting o f statistical i n f ~ r m a t i o nLiberia is starting from a very low base, and this
                                                             . ~ ~
presents an opportunity to coordinate the statistical system from the start. Despite the collapse o f the
official statistical system, Liberia is not data poor. There are in fact many data collection operations
being carried out by humanitarian agencies-much                o f this information has been compiled by the
OCHA Humanitarian Information Centre (HIC). The National Statistics Act and Geo-Information
Act o f 2004 created LISGIS as a semi-autonomous agency, though there are other producers o f
statistics in Liberia including the Central Bank and the government ministries. Each o f these
government bodies has a statistical unit and all will require support to ensure that the entire
statistical system meets the needs o f the country.
Several development agencies are working with Government to reestablish official data collection
activities, both macroeconomic and in key sectors (health, education). DFIDRJNDP, the World
Bank, and the Fundhave provided diagnostic studies in statistical assessment missions, and with
DFID assistance a road map for a medium-term national statistical planhas been introduced, with
the Bank providing assistance under the Statistical Capacity Building Trust Fund for GDDS. A
stakeholders' workshop in 2006 received broad endorsement for key principles o f the plan, and
LISGIS has submitted a proposal to the Statistical Capacity Building Trust Fund. IMF technical
assistance has focused on steps needed for conversion from the Government Financial Statistics
Manual (GFSM) 1986 format to GFSM 2001 and i s assisting the C B L with improving monetary
statistics. With IMF assistance, a transitional consumer price index has been developed, substituting
recent regional market baskets for the 1960s market basket upon which Liberia's index had been
based. Afristat and OECDParis21 have expressed interest in assisting statistics capacity building
for Liberia. A DHS survey i s underway, and will be followed in the field by a CWIQ survey to
provide a basis for the full PRSP, as well as a revised price index. All statistical series will require
resuscitation; doing so in a harmonized and coordinated fashion will enable Liberia to avoid
mistakes made by other countries.
