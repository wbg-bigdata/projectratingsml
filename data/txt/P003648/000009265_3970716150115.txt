PREFACE
Introduction
This English version of the Environmental Assessment Report (EA) for the Shanghai Second
Sewerage Project (SSPII) Phase I has been peared by the Shanghai Academy of Enironental
Sciences (SABS) in close contac with the intemational Design Review and Advisory (DRA)
Consultant.
SAES was assigned by the Shanghai Sewerage Project Construction Company (SSPCC) to carry out
the environmental assme  for SSPII, which the World Bankc has classified as a Category A project.
A Prelimiary EA (PEA) was completed by SAES in August 1994. This document was reviewed by
the DRA Consultant and the conclusions were presented in the Predesign Review Report (PDR)
prepared by the DRA Consultant in January 1995.
Since then SAES has completed the Fmal EA. i.e. a refined and updated report based on the
comments made by the DRA Consultant on the PEA, and an newly available infonnation and
decisions reached during preparation of the project.
The primary task for SAES has been to prepare a Chinese version of the EA, intended for the national
approval process for which NEPA has responsibility. In addiion, SSPCC has responsibility for
providing an English version for approval both by NEPA and the Wodd Bank. This version should
comply with the World Bank Operational Directive 4.01 (OD 4.01).
The DRA Consultant is responsible for ensurng that the Fmal EA has been udated in accordance
with OD 4.01, and that all issues which have emerged as a result of the on-going planning process.
are adequately dealt with.
In order to make this feasible the DRA Consultant has worked in close co-operaion with SAES. As
far as possible marial prepared by SAES, has been translated and made available to the DRA
Consultant. By frequent contact, the various comments and suggestions of the DRA Consultant have
been conmnunicated to SAES, to enable the Academy to consider necessary adjustnents or additions
in the Chinese version of the EA.
The English version of the EA is based on a translation of the Chinese version that has been submitted
to NEPA for approval. Some topics considered to be of particulr interest to the World Bank have
been further elaborated by the DRA Consultant and presented in Supplementary Doctuments. It should
be noted that these documents are fully in accordance with the results and conclusions of the nmin
report.
Several reports included as background material in the Chinese version are not translated into English.

The English version is prested in the same fonmat as the Chinese version. This means that the
format of OD 4-01 is not followed strictly. A List of Chapters in this dotcm  includes cross-
references to the OD 4.01 format for ease of refence. This procedure and format has been adopted
in order to ensure high confonmity bween the two documents so that Ihe national handling and
approval process can be facilitated.
Scope and Status of the Report
This Environmental -Assessnent Report is a 'second level' document in a series of reports produced
for the World Bank appraisal of the SSPI project scheduled for June 1995.
The series of reports includes three levels of docuntation;
Strategic Planning Report               Top level, master plan update for Shanghai
City.
Feasibility Report                      Second level, covers the whole SSPUI
project, and includes several stand-alone
volumes including this Enviromnental
Assessment Report. However this document
is mainly concened with Stage I of the
Project,
Enginoeerng                             Third level, covers SSP!I Stage 1.

Figure p.1 illusaes the rdationship between the three levels of documentation and the various
volumes.
Organisation and Management of the Report
This Report was prepared as part of a study carried out for the preparation of the SSPII Project,
which is included in the World Banks three year lending programme for China. To carry out the
study, the World Bank commissioned Design Review and Advisory Services in connection with the
planning and design of the project and appointed lnacnsult A S (the DRA Consultant) to undertake
the work. The contract was funded by the Norwegian Consultant Fund, Account Nr. TF 020464 The
DRA Consultant entered into an associaion with Mott MacDonald of the UK for this workL In
addition. bilateral funding from the Governments of France and Canada enabled specialist inputs on
the trament of the wasewater and on connection/rehabilitation strategy to be provided by Sogreah
of France and Reid and Crowther of Canada respectively.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Shanghai, with a population of approximately 13 million people and the People's Republic of China's
largest metmpolitan area, is presently enjoying an unprecedented economic growth. However, the
present urban services, and in particular the sewerage and sanitation system is not compatible with
Shanghai's aspiratioa1 to beoDme a major ecowomic aid financial centre.
To improve Shanghai's sanitation, and to reverse the deterioration in the water quality of the rivers
and canals in the metropolitan are brought about by discharges of industial wastes and untreated
sewage, the Shanghai Municipal Government (SMG) has begun a phased programme of
improvements. One of the major projects is the Shanghai Second Sewerage Project (SSPJI)
In Shanghai, the Shanghai Sewerage Company (SSC) is responsible for management of the sewerage
system. The Shanghai Sewerage Project Construction Company (SSPCC) has been formed by SMG
to undertake project implementation.
SMG has requested the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the World Bank) for
financial support to SSPII
The Environmental Assessment Report (EA) for SSPIL Phase I, has been produced to meet the
requiements of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the World Bank. The World
Bank has advised that the SSPII project is a Category A projecL Shanghai Academy of Environental
Sciences (SAES) has been conmissioned by SSPCC to prepare the EA.
The legal framework for the EA is the Enviromnental Protection Law, the Water Law, the Water
Pollution Prevention and Control Law, and the Land Management Law of the People's Republic of
China, together with a number of national and local regulations and standards based on these laws-
The SSPII Project
SSPI will collect wastewater from the Wujing and Minhang Industrial areas, from the Xuhui. Luwan,
Huangpu. Hongkou and Yangpu districts in Puxi. and from the Pudong New Area. Because of the
substantial invesunents required, the SSPI project will be implemented in phases. A priority has been
laid down for the order in which the SSPn drainage catcbments are to be served. The Phase I service
area will be the Wujing and Minhang industrial areas, the Xuhui and Luwan districts of Puxi, and 156
kn2 of the Pudong New Area. In total, the Phase I service area will cover 269.5 lak2 with a
population of 2.8 million. The wastewater volume for Phase I is ested to be 1.7 million m31day,
while the ultinate flow (year 2020) is 5.1 million m3lday.

Appraisal Report - Volme 4:Enivironauetal Assessmrne
The main components of the SSPII project are interception facilities, inverted siphons underneath the
Huangpu River and other water channcls, sewage conveyors, wastewater treatment and sludge
handling facilities, and a submerged outfall into the Changjiang Esuary.
The tota! capital cost (including land) of the SSPII. Phase l, is estimated to be 5.177 billion Yuan-.
The completion date for Phase I is 1998.
Existing Water Environment Status
The Shanghai area has a network of rivers and canals. The principal river, the Huangpu. flows
through the metropolitan area The Huangpu is a tidal river with a net average flow of 341 mA/s. In
addition to the functions of navigation, industrial and agricultural water use. The Huangpu is also a
source of drinking water to the Shanghai area. The Huangpu receives the majority of the municipal
wastewater. and is polluted. The water quality has been monitored at different sections of the river,
and the results show high contents of pollutants such as organic material (COD) and ammonia-
nitrogen.
The tributaries and canals connected to Huangpu are controlled by sluicegates. These tnbutaries are
generally heavily polluted ("black and stink'). There are several water intakes in these tributaries
supplying different townships with water.
The Changjiang (Yangtze River), the longest nver in China, flows to the north of Shanghai about 20
kn away from the City Proper, and has an average flow of 29,300 m3Is. The Changjiang flows into
the East China Sea. Bailonggang, which is located on the South Channd of the estuazy, is proposed
as the location for the SSPII Phase I outfall. The water quality around Bailonggang is mainly affected
by the river flow, the tide and the coastal current. A water quality survey indicates that the water
quality is basically good, with a few exceptions. COD values indicate some pollution. and ammonia-
nitrogen is affected by the water coming frm upstream, especially during the drought season. The
dissolved oxygen is always mntained at a high level. The ChangJiang carries silt from upstream to
the estuary and this has a significant impact on the estuary. The light transmittance is poor because
of the silt, and this restricts the growth and production of algae, thus preventing the occurrence of
Red Tides.
At Bailonggang there is an existing outfall directly to the beach (the South Trunk Sewer). This
discharge causes senous pollution near the outfall.
Environmental Benefits of the Project
The main environmental benefits of the SSPII sewerage project will be improved water quality in the
Huangpu River and its tributaries. In addition the project will allow the Pudong area to be developed
satisfactorily.

Appmisul RePon - Voume 4:Environnenal Assessmer
Water quality models for the river networks have been used to predict the water quality in rivers and
creeks. Tbe results show that there will be an overll improvement in the water quality.
There are important drinking water supplies in the upper Huangpu reachcs, and the collection and
interception of wastewater from Wujing and Minhang areas will directly safeguard these water
intakes.
At Bailonggang the existing outfall will be abandonned and the sewage diverted into the proposed
submerged outfall. This will improve the local environmental situation considerably.
In addition to the direct positive cnvironental impact there will also be important secondary benefits
from the project, as: for example health benefits caused by a reduction in water born diseases,
increased property values, aesthetic benefits and development benefits. A project of this nature must
be viewed within the overall context of the future economic development in Shanghai. particularly
the Pudong area. If adequate sewerage infrastructure is not provided, then the economic development
of the Pudong New Area would not be sustainable.
Adverse Envirnmental Impacts of the Project
Despite the fact that the project is designed to improve the environment, such a large project will also
have some unavoidable negative impacts. Of particular concem is the waater discharge to the
Changjiang Estuary, and impacts related to the construction period.
To estimate the quality of the SSPII sewage, samples have been taken from the SSPI sewage. Based
on this data, the following loads are estimated from the SSPII sewage: BOD5 190 t/day. COD 422
t/day, NH37N 47 t/day, Tot-P 7 tlday, based on a flow of 1.7 million ni/day.
Studies have shown that the concentation of dissolved oxygen in the Changjiang Essmary is always
at a high level. This indicates that problems with oxygen deficiency are not to be expected. BOD
discharges are therefore unlikely to cause problems, and priority should not be given to the removal
of BOD from the SSPII discharge.
Nutrient levels and Red Tides are a problem in the Changjiang Estuary. Results from the Hangzhou
Bay Envmonental Study show high levels of both nitrogen and phosphorous in the study area. and
this is thought to contribute to the problems of the Red Tides. However, the conribution of N and
P from Shanghai is minimal compared to the loads discharge by the Changjiang into the East China
Sea. For this reason there is no immediate urgency to provide more than preliminary treatment for
the SSPII Phase I discharge. Land should, however, be ensured for future upgrading. A policy of
phosphorous control should be considered at a later stage of the project.
Sinmlations of the SSPII Phase I discharge show that at the discharge point there will be a mixing
zone, in which the dilution will be less than 50, extending to between 0.5 to 3.2 krr. dependent on
the season. The probability of pollution rising to the surface of the estuary is less than 5 %, and the

plume will not reach the river bank. A passage for fish migration will thus be preserved.
Implementation of the SSPII project will require pmanent and temporary acqisition of fanrland,
danolition of houses, and cause interference to water and land transportation. The land acquiSition
and resettlement will be handled and compenated for in accordance with national and local policies.
A Resettlemet Action Plan (RAP) is under preparation. To minimize the impact from  the
construction period, diffrent mitigation measures will be put into action. A summary of these is
enclosed.
Conclusion
The Environmentl Assessment is based on scientific studies and modelling work, and the mai
conclusions are:
The adverse environmenal imp    from the SSPII are limited. The wastewater discharged to the
Changjiang Estuary at Bailonggang will effectively be diluted and dispersed ito the very large water
body with only minor impacts.
During the construction period the potential adverse inpacts are significant, and it is therefore very
impornmt that necessaxy mitigation measures are taken to avoid or limit these impacts.
The SSPII Project will result in important environmental benefits:
SSPII will contnrbute significantly to the improvement of water quality in the Huangu
and its tnrbutaries in Puxi and Pudong.
*    SSPII will eliminate the existing southern outfall at Bailonggang and thus improve the
local environment.
*    SSPII is an inportant project for the developnt of Shanghai, especially the Pudong
New Area.
*    SSPII will improve the sanitation system and the waterways and thus be beneficial to
the inhabitants of Shanghai both in tenns of health and in terms of quality of life-

1.     INTRODUCTION
1.1    Background Information
1.1.1   Location and Climate
Shanghai is situated at the mouth of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) at 31014'N and 12129'E. It
borders the East China Sea to the east, Eanhou Bay to the south, the ChangJiang to the north, and
Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces to the west (Fig. 1.1).
Shanghai is situated on the fluvial plain formed by the interaction between the Changjiang and the sea.
[t has an area of 6,340 lak2. of which land accounts for 6,218 kn2 and water surface for 122 kn2.
The climate of Shanghai has characteristics of monsoon areas influenced by the sea, with four distinct
seasons and abundant rainfall. It exhibits a humid subtropic monsoon cliniate.
1.12   Socal Economy
Shanghai is a metropolis directly under the jurisdiction of the cental government. It is divided into
14 districts and 6 counties. It had a total population of 12.95 million at the end of 1993. Shanghai
is one of the most imnportant industrial bases in China, and also the biggest port and an important
centre of economy, science and technology, trade, finance, information and culture. Shanghai has
a vical position in the national economy of China (Fig. 1.2). According to statistics for 1993, the per
capita GDP and per capita national income are 3.4 times the average nationwide levels. Its industrial
output accounts for one-sixeenth. port trade volume of one-fourth. export commodity one-seventh.
and revenue one-twelfth of the national figures. The GDP of Shanghai amounts to 151.161 billion
yuan with a total industrial and agricultural production value of 342.324 billion yuan.
1.1.3   Water Networkl
Shanghai has a comprehensive natual waterway network with an average density of 6 - 7 kin/lJ2.
The Changjiang, the longest river in China. is about 20 Ikn to the norb of the main City- It has an
average dicwharge of 29,300 ni./s with an annual flow of 900 billion m'n The other major waterways
in the city are the Huangpu River, the most important surface water source in Shanghai. and Wusong
Creek (Suzhou Creek), the biggest of its tributaries. Among others, Yunzao Bang, Gaoqiao Gang,
Qiu Jiang. Yangpu Gang, Hongkou Gang, Bailian Jing, Liulei Tang, Laoyu Tang, and man-made
channels such as Jinhui Canal, Dazhi Canal, Dianpu Creek, Chuanyang Canal, form the Huangpu

River system ( see Fig. 1.3).
1.1.4   Exisdting Sewage Systems
Based on statistics. the total wastewater discharged from Shanghai amounts to 5.5 million 3/Id. of
which 3.75 million m3/d is industrial effluent and 1.75 million m31d is domestic sewage, accounting
for 68% and 32%, respectively, of the city total. Of these wastewaters, only 180,000 m31d, about
3% of the total, is subject to tratm   in sewage treament works before being discharged, and mosL
of this is domestic-sewage. The West Trunk Sewer and South Tnuink Sewer built in 1970s are
designed to convey 1,000,000 m?Jd of sewage to the Changjiang estuary and the East China Sea
respectively, accounting for 18 percent of the city total. No treatment is provided for this sewage and
it is discharged through the intrtidal outfalls, the environment in the vicinity has been subject to a
certain amount of pollution. The combined sewerage project stage 1 ( SSPI ) was completed in 1993
and is designed to convey 1,400,000 Tr3 Id of sewage from the city proper and 300.000 meld from
the Gaoqiao area. At present, of the total amount of the sewage from the Puxi area, 2,580.000 m3
.d is disposed of outside the city with the remaining 3,000,000 n3 Id, accounting for 54 %, being
discharged into the Huangpu River without any proper treatment ( Table .1 ).

of the city.
1.2    Sewerage Development
In 1984, with the help of Australia consultants on the Shanghai Liquid Waste Management Study,
Shanghai Environmental Protection Bureau planned a strategy for the management of Shanghai urban
sewage. This reconmnended the phased construction of sewer system to discharge the intercepted
sewage into the Changiiang River and the East China Sea to use the natural dilution capacity of these
water bodies.
The policy adopted in the Shanghai Sewerage Plan combines localised and decentralized treatment
systems. As Shanghai is being located on the estuary of the Changjiang, it is beneficial to discharge
untreated sewage from the city to these water bodies with a large dilution capacity providinig that the
water quality standards for these water bodies can be met. At the same time, a number of existing
and planned small scaled sewage treatment works serving areas outside the service area of principal
sewer systems, will provide treatment services.
Table 1.2 illustrates the planned sewerage system in Shanghai.

completed sewer system is 70.57 kanz with capacity of 1,700,000 mIld dry weather flow, and its
service population is 2,550,000. Total investment for project construcion was 1.6 billion yuan.
Sewage intercepted and tansported by the system is dischargeLinto the Changjiang River dtrough
the outfall at Zhuyuan. Before being discharged into the river, the sewage is subject to preliminary
treaument which consists of large- and small-sized screens as well as sedimentation tanks ( Fig. 1.4
and 1.5).
122   Rldocation of Water Supply Intake to the Upper Huangpu River
In order to improve the water supply water for the city, Shanghai Municipal Government cormnenced
in 1985 a project to relocate the water supply intake to a site near Songpu Bridge in the upper reaches
of the Huangpu River. The first phase of the project construion of temporary intake at Linjiang was
completed in July 1987 (Fig. 1.6). In 1992, Shanghai Water Company formally applied to the World
Bank for a loan to complete the second construction phase of the water intake relocation
project. Construction for this phase started in 1994, and is scheduled to be completed in 1997. After
the completion of the project, a water transfer system will provide the existing water treatment works
in the Puxi area ( except Baoshan water works ) with 5,000,000 m3;d of water from the upper reaches
of the Huangpu River. This will greatly imrprove the water supply quality in Shanghai.
1.2.3   Wujing and MiNhang Sewage Inteepor Project
According to the results of analysis of polution sources in the upper Huangpu water source protection
zonc and related water quality modelling, wthdrawal of water at Songpu Bridge would lead to a
variation in the flow of the Huangpu River, which would allow polluted water in the Minhang and
Wujing section to the river to affect water quality at the proposed intake at Daqiao. In order to
protect the water quality at the Daqiao intake, the Shanghai Envrnent Project recommended in
1993 an option that, in addition to the measures for water pollution control in Songjiang County, the
industrial effluent generated from Minhang and Wujing should be intercepted by a northern trunk
sewer and discharged into the Changiang River through the proposed outfall at Bailonggang.
1.7.4   Sewage Disposal in the Podong Area
Since announcing the development and opening up of Pudong New Area by the Slate Council in April
1990, there have been dramatic changes in the urbanized areas and land use without a corresponding
increase in capacity of the municipal infrastructure. According to preliminary planning, the
wastewater flow in the Pudong New Area is about 1.4 million m3/d, which canot be catered for by
the existing municipal sewerage system, let alone to deal with the long-term requirements for
development and apening up of the Pudong New Area. Therefore, the construction of sewerage in
Pudong is vital for the development of the area.

Appraisal Rcpot - Volme 4:Envitoamenal Assessmt
1.2.5   Shangh  Second Seweage Project (SSPI)
To provide a satisfactory methd for final disposal of sewage presedy discharged into the Huangpu
River. die recommended outline is that three additional trunk sewers (northemn, middle, and southern)
are constructed to intercept the combined sewage from Puxi and wastewatr from the Pudong New
Area and convey it via thre turnks crossing the Huangpu to Bailonggang for discharge after certain
degree of treatment, into the Changjiang cstuary through three or four submerged outfalls with
diffuser systems (Fig. 1.7 and Table 1.3). The sewage from Puxi will be conveyed under the Huangpu
via siphons at Nenjiang Road, Dongjiadu and Baibuqiao at Longhua.
The scale of the project requires a phased approach both because of the large investment required and
because it is estimated that it will take ten years to reach the design capacity.
After consideration of the operation of the existng South Trunk Sewer and the service areas of the
proposed northern, middle, southern and Wujing-Minhang trunk sewems, and bearing in mind projects
under construction or proposed in the Pudong New Arna, the recommended phasing option proposes
that the easten section of the middle trunlk western section of the southn trunk and the connector
sewer along Jianping Road, and the related outfall, sewage tmrnemt plant and teminal punping
station be implemented first, in order that as much wastewater as possible could be intercepted at least
capital investmnt TIhe total dry weather flow of the Shanghai Second Sewerage Project (SSPII)
would be 1.7 million m3Id.
1.3    Need for the Project
At present, the general enviromnental quality in Pudong New Area is better than in Puxi. However,
the surface waters have been subject to increasing pollution, and the pollutionproblemin the Huangpu
River is getting worse year by year. Water bodies along the ChangJiang River can basically meet the
requirements of Category 11 of the State Surface Water Environmental Quality Standards (GB3838-
88). while the quality of water at Bailonggang, because of the discharge of sewage from the Southen
Trunk Sewer, has been severely degraded.
In the Puxi area. large amounts of untreated sewage (excepting dtose interoepted by SSPI) and effluent
from the sewage treatment works are discbarged into the Huangpu River and its tributaries, brmging
about a significant impact on the environment and on public health and compromising the position
of Shanghai as an international metropolis in the next cenuiry.
It has now become urge=t to implement the construction of SSPII in order to develop the Pudong New
Area, improve the investment enviromnent, disposing of sewage from the central cty area, protecting
the water quality of the upper Huangpu water source protection zone and solving the sewage problem
in Minhang and Wujing.

In order to ascertain the quality of the seweagc in the cxisting SSPI conveyor, a programme of
daily sampling and analysis of wasewater generated from the Puxi area has been carried out over
a period of one month. Table 2.3 shows the results.

In addition, daily analyses of sewage stegth of the sewage from the Souther Trunk Sewer was
also carried out between 1 - 30 March 1995. The results show high concentrations of BOD
(Table 2.4). These data are high for normal domestic wastwaters. This may be a result of
diumping nigltsoil into the Southern TrUnk Sewer and the results may not be typical of SSPII.

2.2.2.2 Industrial Fraction
The Wujing-Minhang area is an industrial zone with a high proportion of industrial effluent. If the
wastewaters generated there are classified as 'clean' and 'dirty", the 'dirty' portion represems
only a small pan of the total industrial effluent (for instance, five major polluters discharge about
0.5 million m3/d of wastewater of which "dirty' effluent is only 20%). Based on this the COD
concentation will rise from 50 mg/l to an esimated 250 mg/l. and that of ammonia nitrogen from
6 mgnl to 30 mg/l.
T.he waeater quality is closely related to the proportion of industrial effluent and the
dcharactristcs of wastewaters wiUl be different from one industial sector to another. However, an
overall comparison will give an industrial view of the wastewater quality, particularly as the
proportion of industrial effluent from SSPI and SSPH are similar (Table 2.5).

2.2.2.3 Total Flow
From the above analysis, the design effluent quality for SSPII can be equated to the results of the
analyses of the SSPI sewer. However, in order to err on the side of caution, the average
wastewater concenrations or the 95 % not exceded concentration (except for that of total
phosphorus because of its discrete observations) are to be used according to circumstance (Table
2.6).

2.5.2   Quantity of Spoil
Based on the above construction methods and the calculated volumes of conveyors, the quantity of
spoil gererated from the constuction of SSPII is esimated as 1.277 million m3, assuming a
bulking factor of 1.1 (Table 2.5).
2.5.3 Options for Spoil Disposl
The spoil generated during the construction is mnixed. In consultation with Shanghai and Pudong
spoil management institutes, this spoil could be used for non-smirutual reclamation or road
building. The principles to be followed for disposal of spoil are:
(1)   Disposal should be localised wherever possible to give minimm  local impact;
(2)   Disposal should cause no effect on the social envioment and people's living
-standards;
(3)   Spoil should not be disarged into waterways.
Disposal of the 1.277 million m3 spoil would be in three ways as shown in Table 2.9.

3.     ENVIRONMNITAL SETTING OF THE PROJECT-RELATED AREA
The project area comprises Xuhui and Luwan Districts in Puxi, and 7 townships of Yangsi, Sanlin,
Beicai, Zhangjiang, Tangzhen, Wanggang and Heqing in Pudong.
3.1    Natural Setflng
3.1.1   Geographic Situation
Xuhui and Luwan Districts are sitated to the west of the Huangpu River and in the southern fringe
of Shanghai Proper.
Pudong New Area is situated to the east of the Huangpu River, borders the Changjiang estuary in the
east and the Huangpu River in the west, and is adjacent to Nanhui County and Minhang District in
the south. The project-related area oDvers 7 townships located in the southern and middle parts of
the New Area (Fig. 3.1).
3.1.2   Geology and Morphology
In this area the strata is a alluvion of the Changjiang River formed by accumulation of silt carried by
the Changjiang under the interaction of wave and tide. Its shape is triangular stn u ling from Wusoung
Kou toward the southeast. The elevation of the area is about 3.5 to 4.5 m. being higher in the
southeast and lower in northwest. Only a few areas have an elevation over 5 m above Wusong
Datm. The average elevation of Liuli, Beicai, Zhangjiang, Wauggang, Heqing. etc. is about at 3.5
to 3.9  , whilst that of Yangsi and Tangzhen is over 4 m
From driling tests it is known that the stm   in this area, from bottom to top is as follows: volcanic
rock of Jurassic period (pyroclastic-edimentary rock), continental volcanic rock of Tertiary period
and accumulation horizon including clay and sand-gavel of Quatenary period. Basic rock is
generally at a depth of 300 to 350 mwith the shallowest one of 227 m at Jinqiao and the deepest one
of 396 m at Heqing.
The volcanic action in the later Jurassic period was apparently dominated by a real fracture structure
from Fengjing to Chuansha, and a tectnic volcanic basin was developed on this fracture at Jinqiao.
In respect of engineering geology, the soil layer less than 30 m deep was primarily formed by the
sedimntary bed of marine and river-lake phases in the Holocene epoch. The lithological soil mainly
comprises clay, subclay and silt.
3.1.3   Climate
The project area is at the northern edge of the north subtropic zone and is affected by east Asian

monsoons. The climate is maritime with four distioct seasons and abudant precipitation, full of
sunshine, and with modate temperaue. In this area the mean annual temperature is 15.50C.
evaporation is 1436 m- and annl precipitation is 1428.5 mm concenrat  in the period of May to
September. Wind direction is genrally southeast, but is sometime  northwest and northeast.
Typhoom or tropical storms are often during July to Septmber, and strong typhoons occur 3 to 4
times every 10 years.
3.1.4 Natural Disaster - Earthquake
The project-related area situated is east of the Kunshan-Huzhou Seismic Belt of the Changjiang River
Delta and is a low risk earthqake region. The first incident recorded was in 961 AD. Since then
there have been 60 records of earthquake, in which only one was destructive. This happened on I
September 1624 and the intensity at the epifocus is estimated to have been Richter scale 6.
3.1.5 Groundwater
The project area has a series of aquifers of considerable thickness. The groundwater in the shallow
stratum is slightly brackish, whilst in deeper strata is mosty fresh.
3.2    Ecological Environment
3.2.1   Welland Resources
From the old beach to Sanjia Gang of Cbangjiang estary. 24 km in length, there are spread several
pieces of land with shoot weeds, with reeds and shallow waters, totally 535.2 ha in area.
From Sanjia Gang to Panjiahong, 11.7 hn in length, the wetland are broad with grass and reeds,
totally 399.4 ha in area in which the area of wedand 2 - 3 m above Datum is about 865.4 ba, and
166.7 ha are reclaimable.

dwell in woods near villages or towns whilst collecting food in the farmland during daytine.
3.3     Socio-Econmic Aspects
3.3.1   Population and Land
According to the statstics for late 1993, there were 185.300 people living in the 7 townships on the
alignment of the SSPII, Phase 1, conveyors in Pudong, of which 53,000 are non-agricultural
popu!ation. In the land area of 130.45 km2, 4,825.6 ha is cultivated land: Population density is
1,420 per kml (Table 3.1). Along with decrease in cultivated land area due to rapid encroachment
by urban and rmal construction in recent years, the average cultivated land per capita is only about
0.8 to 1.1 mnu (530 - 730 m2).-
The total population of XuLui and Luwan Districts in Pusxi is 1,187,500. Land areas of those districts

3.4.1   Status of Sewerage System in Luwa and Xuhui Districts
Except for some of the sewage of Xuhui and Luwan which is drained off to the South Tnmk Sewer
or to Longhua Sewage Treamet lant, the rest is discharged to the Huangpu River and its tributaries
via pumping stations. In the constuction area (21.7 bar) of the SSPII, there are six sub-cn.ments,
each equipped with a pumping station (Fig. 3.2). The location and discharging direction of these
pumping stations are presented in Table 3.2.

3.4.2   Status of Sewerage System South of Zbaojia Gou, Pudong
At present, the sewage collection systen is somnewhat backward in Pudong. In the newly developing
area, it has separate systems for storm mnoff and sewage, whilst in the old area, there is a cotnbined
sewerage system. At present, as there is only one sewage treatment plant in Pudong, a lot of
industrial effluent and sanitary sewage is mostly discharged into the tributaries of the Huangpu River.
with more being directly discharged into the Huangpu River through the storm water drainage system.
Some sewage is discharged to the South Trunk Sewer.
3.4.2.1 Sewage Treatment Plant
Dongchang Sewage Treatment Plant, which was built in 1954 and expanded in 1968 is the only one
in Pudong. It has a design capacity of 7,000 m3/d but treats only 4.000 m3/d, and services the areas
of Dongchang and Qicangzhan. This sewage treatment plant provides only primary processing before
discharging to the Huangpu River.
3.42.2 Storm Water Pumping Stations
In the older Pudong area along the Huangpu River, there are 11 storm water pumping stations, the
main function of which is to discharge the runoff into the Huangpu River during the rainy season.
Names and locations of those 11 pumping stations are shown in Table 3.3.

3.4.2.3 South Trunk Sewer
The South Trunk Sewer, built at the beginning of the 1970s is 29 kn long and takes the sewage from
Nanshi District and adjoining areas in Pudong. Its original design capacity was 300.000 ni3l/d but
since rehabilitation in 1983, the capacity has been increased to 550,000 m3/d.
There are 6 boosting pumping stations along the trunk sewer and 5 sewage pumping stations on the
link sewers which collec flows generated from the service areas. The link sewer pumping stations
are located at Dezhou Road, Shangnian Road, Hunan Road, Longdong Road and Wendeng Road.

4.     PRESENT STATUS OF RIVER SYSTEMS IN THE SHANGHAI AREA
4.1    Environmentl Status of Inland Wakrways
4.1.1   Bakgoud
Shanghai, located in the Taihu Lake Basin, is surrounded and divided by a network of rivers and
lakes. The average density of the waerway network is 6-7 km/fkm2 with a maximum density of 20
knmm. The Changjiaug, Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek are the three nmain rivers in the
Shanghai area.
4.1.2 TIe Huangpu River
The total length of the Huangpu River measured from Dianfeng is 113.4 kn of which the main
trunk mcasures 84.56 kn from Mishidu to Wusong Kou (Figure 4.1). The average river discharge
flow estimated over many years is 341 mni3s. The average widti is about 500 m, and it is 800 m
wide at Wusong Kou. The depth is 5-15 m. with the deepest point being about 20 m. From the
city cene to the river mouth is about 39 km. Water levels vary each day due to tidal effects.
The tidal rnge at Wusong Kou is 2.27 m and the maximum tidal range during the summer
typhoon season can reach 4.48 m The spring tide can travel upstram to Dianfeng. The Huangpu
River, as the main drainage chanel from Taihu Lake, takes an anmnal flow of 2.215 billion m3
from Taihu Lake which is 78% of the total rnoff flow.
Since the Huangpu River receives much of Shanghai's municipal and industrial wastewater, the
river quality is affected. The section of river witn the city is particularly polluted. In addition to
being used for navigation and flood drainage, the Huangpu River is also the main drinldng water
source for Shanglbpi nnmicipality. Presently, four water intakes at Linjiang, Minhang.-Wusong
and Zhabei are used to supply the city. The capacity taken from the Huangpu River each day is
about 4,700,000 n3, 89% of which is taken at Linjiang water intake, 2% at Minhang section and
9% downstream of Zhabei and Wusong.
The present chaacteristics of the main river are shown in Table 4.1.

4.1.3    Puxi Tribut es of the Huangpu River
Wthin the area related to the project construction, Longhua Gang and Puhui Tang are receiving
water bodies of the effluent genemrated in the proposed service areas. These tributaries have no
water sources themselves and are only connected with the Huangpu River and its tributaty
network (Fig 4.2). In order to prevent flooding a gate has been installed at the connection point
with the Huangpu River. Since the outflow is blocked and waste water and surface runoff are
contnualy entering the watercourse, the water quality is extremely bad (Table 4.2 and Table
4.3).

4.1.4 Network of Waterways in Pudong Area
4.1.4.1 Network Distribution Characte
Pudong New Area, is largely bounded by sea and rivers. The average ground level is about 4 m.
being higher in the southeast and lower in the northwest. The area is cnss-crossed by rivers and
ditches and the density of the network of waterways is 8.5 km/ln2. The area of inland water
accounts for 16.3% of the land. There arc I i key river courses with a total length of 176.95 kan
(Fig 4.3).
Chuanyang Canal, with a total length of 28.25 kn, is mainly used for flood diversion and
navigation. It flows from the Huangpu River in the west to the Sanjia Gang and then to the
Changjiang Estuary at the coast. Pudong Canal which runs through the Pudong New Area,
Nanhui and Fengxian Counties, is a trunk river for south/north flood diversion and navigation in
mne eastern parr of the area. All other rivers are natural water courses. The east/west river course
is about 6 m wide and the north/south rivers are 4-12 m wide. The riverbed bottom is at an
elevation of 0 - 1.0 m and the chanmel is quite shallow and narrow.
Since he Pudong New Area is located on a river p:ain and water gates have to be set up to
connect the network with the Huangpu River or Changjiang River, the hydrodynamics are
consequently in xtemely bad condition. In addition, many traditional village areas have been
urbanized due to development in recent years, but the sewerage system is not adequate. As a
result the river network also receives waste water and surface water runoff.
4.1.4.2 Present Status of Water Quality in Pudong River Network
Since the river network in Pudong lacks hydrodynamic self-cleaning capability, but receives
substantial pollution load it has become anaerobic (Table 4.4).
There arc 3 existing water treatment works along the Chuanyang Canal, located at Beicai. Yaoshi
and Chuansha Town. Nevertheless the water qualily in the Chanyang Canal is still unsatisfactory

4.2          Environmental Status of the Changjiang Estuary
4..1         Natural Conditions
Below Xuliujing, the estuary of the Changiang River is split by Chongming Island into the South
and North Branches. The South Channel and North Channel divide from the Souti Branch below
Liuhe River by Changxing and Hengsha Islands, and the South Chanmel is further divided into Lhe
South and North Passages. Thus, the estuary divides into three levels with four branches entering
the sea (Fig. 4.4).
The river flow of Changjiang is very large. Based on records from the hydrographic station at
Datong, about 624 kan upstream from the mouth just beyond the tidal linit, the annual mean river
discharge flow is 29,300 i3I/s with max flow of 92,600  l3s and total annual flow of 924 billion
-3 The river flow shows seasonal variations: the period of May to October is the flood season,
accounting for 72% of annual total with the highest month in July; the period of November to
April is the drought season accoxiting for 28%;, with the lowest flow in Februay.
Downstam from Xuliujing, the distribution of the flow between the Branches is uneven and
changeable with time. Most of the flow is dtrough the South Branch; the flow emtering the North
Branch is decreasing and can basically be neglected. The flow in the North and South Channels is
comparatively close, and the flows in both Passages are quite similar to each other. From data
gathered since 1956, the flow in the North Channel is larger than that in the South, and the flow
in the North Passage is larger than that in the South.
The tidal regime in the estuary follows an irregular semidiurmal shallow water pattern. Because the
estuay is very wide. the tidal inflow is very significant. Under average annual conditions, the tide
inflow at the river mouth could be 266,300 m3/s, 8.8 times that of the annual averaged flow, and
the total inflow could be 3.25 billion e3. The inflow of a neap tide in the draught season is about
1.3 billion m3, and the inflow of a spring tide in the flobd season could be 5.3 billion rn3.
Outside the estuary there exists a forward tidal  rren in the East China Sea and a rotary tidal
wave in the Yellow Sea. Both tidal range and current are affected by these two tidal systems. and
particularly by the East China Sea current Because of the restraining indluence of the channels,
the propagation of the tidal current is parallel with the aris of channels.
Because of these conditions, there are differences in the duration of both flood tide and ebb tide
on the upper river. Generily, the duration of ebb tide is longer than that of flood tide. The
further, upstream, the shorter the duration of flood tide, and the longer the duration of the ebb

tide. At Bailonggang, there is a two-hour difference between the duration of the flood and of ebb
tides.
The avcrage tidal difference outside of the river mouth is about 2.5 m in general, and increases
westwards. At Xiajun, the range in tidal level is 2.91 m; whilst that at Bailonggang Section being
2.6 m.
The current velocity regime is basically similar to the tide regime. Current velocity increases as
the river surface becomes narrower. The average velocity is 0.7 - 1.2 mls for ebb tide and 0.7 -
0.95 m/s for flood tide. The maxumun current velocity could be over 2.3 m/s. The maximum
flood tide occurs 1 - 1.5 hours before high tide, maxinmm ebb tide occurs I - 2 hours before low
tide and tidal reversal occurs 1 - 2 hours before and after the middle level tide.
The Changjiang River is a silt-rich river. According to data from Datong Station, the river
carries about 486 million tonnes of silt per annum. The average annual silt content is 0.547 kg/r3.
The naxinum annual silt-carrying load is 678 million tons and the minimum is 341 million tons,
ranking fourth among the large rivers in the world. During the flood season, the silt load accounts
for 87% of that of whole year, whilst in July it carries about 21% of whole year. The silt load in
February reaches the lowest level less than 0.7% of the annual total. At Datong Station, silt with a
size of less than O.1mm accounts for 94.9%. The median is 0.027 mm and whilst that for
suspended silt in the estuary is 0.019 mm. Silt in the estuary mainly comprises fine sand and clay,
becoming finer from Xuliujing towards the mouth. From the Lanmensa to the outside of the river
mouth, the silt content becomes similar. The mineral constitents of the suspended silt mainly
include heavy minerals as magetized, ibnenie, epidoze. hematite, amphibole, garnet. etc., and clay
minerals such as iLi'e, chiorile, kaoinite, and montmonilonite.
The temporal and spacial variation of suspended solids in the Changjiang Estuary is comparatively
complex. According to on-site measurements ( August 1978 ). the silt content of the North
Branch is higher than that of South Branch, the North Channel is higher than South Channel, and
the South Passage is higher than North Passage; the North Branch has the highest SS content and
South Channel the lowest. The SS content at Lamnmensha at the river mouth is higher than that
upstream or downstream, and is the most turbid zone in the estuary. The SS content varies with
the season being high in sununer and low in winter. However, beyond the river mouth, the
situation is different. In water with a depth over 30 m, the suspended silt content does not vary
greatly with the season and the annual average content is below 0.1 Kg/mni
Saline intrusion at the Changjiang River mouth varies. In summer, with large fresh water flows,
fresh water dominates the area within. the Hengsa Section. In winter, because of the lower fresh
water flow, saline intrusion occurs. According to on-site measurements in 1986, the salinity of
bottomn water at Flood Tide Trench ( Changxing ) and Majiagang was 5%o, and in February 1987,
the highest salinity level of water surface at Zhuyuan reached 6%. and that of bottom water

reached 8%o. Records show that the highest saline level at Waigaoqiao was 9.07%o. In general,
saline intrusion in the North is higher than in the South.
4.2.2   Water Environental Conditions
422.1 Hydrographic Condition and Siltation
Bailonggang is adjacent to the point where the South Channel branches into the South and North
Passages. On-site mieasurements show that the current velocity in the deep water of this section is
very high. At spring tides, the average current velocity of the flood tide is 0.60-1.08 n/s and at
ebb tide is 0.67-1.29 m/s. Whilst the maximin velocity of flood tides is 2.12 m/s and that of ebb
tide is 2.27 m/s, occuring at the surface. For the bottom layer, the average current velocity is
lower: the velocity of flood tide is 0.36-0.89 ni/s and the ebb tide is 0.52-1.20 mls. The current
velocity of flood tides in the drought season is higher than that in the flood season, and the
velocity of ebb tides in flood season is higher than that in drought season. In the flood season,
the current velocity of the ebb tide is higher than that of flood tide, and in the drought season, the
velocity of the flood tide is close to that of ebb tide.
Table 4.1 illustrates the velocity of current at Bailonggang during the drought and flood seasons,
and shows that in the deep water zone of the main channel, the current velocity is relatively high,
whereas the current velocity of the ebb tide in shallow water near the shore is much lower. In the
zone between thI- Rhnllow water and the deep water, because of the steep slope in the river bed,
there is a signific.   , sswise variation in flow velocity. The Bailonggang Area can be divided
into three zones frow- she south bank to the centre of the river, as follows: shallow water zone,
transition zone ( baween the shallow water zone and deep water zone ) and deep water zone.
The average silt content of South Channel is between 0.2-1.0 kg/m3. The silt content of spring
tides is higher than that of neap tides, and the silt content of bottom layers is higher than that of
the top layers. The silt content of the top layer is 0.1-0.6 kg/m3 and that of the bottom layers is
0.3-5.0 kg/rn3. Suspended silt in the South Channel mainly comprises fine sand and clay. Clay
accounts for 42-55%. The silt content in the South Channel varies according to the tidal cycle.
There are two obvious peaks in each tidal cycle. The period between maximum flood and slack
flood and that between maximum ebb and slack ebb are periods with high silt content. The
characteristics of suspended silt transportation in the South Channel are that, the silt transportation
capacity of the spring tide in the flood season is higher than that in drought season, and, the silt
transportation capacity of the neap tide in a drought season is higher than that in flood seasons.
and that of ebb tide in the flood season is higher than that in the drought season.

The silt content at Bailonggang is higher compared with other sections in the South Channel, and
in addition, the variation in silt content is very significant. According to measurements carried
out in March 1991 and July 1992, the vertical average silt content at flood tide was 0.04 - 0.82
kgim', and that at ebb tide was 0.05 - 0.65 kg/rn. The average top clevation silt conment at flood

In summer, because of the high river discharge flow from the Changjiang, fresh water dominates
the water area near the proposed Bailonggang outfall with a salinity of about 0.1 %a. In wintcr,
because of the effects of saline intrusion, the salinity rises. Figure 4.5 shows the variation of
salinity with tidal cydes at the measurement station 3.5 km away from the shore.

Water quality in the Changiiang Estuary is affected mainly by flow, tides and currents along the
shore and has wide spacial and temporal variations. Table 4.2 illustrates the water quality results

From this it can be seen that the water at Bailonggang has been subject to pollution by organic
pollutants and some heavy metals.
The silt content at Bailonggang is higher than other sections of the South Channel. Silt brought to
the esmary mainly comprises fine sand and clay which have a strong adsorption capacity for
pollutarts especially for heavy metals, resulting in a great reduction of pollution concentration in
these waters ( Table 4.9 ).

42.2.3 Substrate Quality
Because of the direct discharge of untreated sewage fron the outle ( at Bailonggang ) of the
existing South Trnk Sewer to the Changdiang Estuary, the substrate of the shore has been subject
to obvious pollution. There is a belt of black sludge 200 - 300 m in width and 10 - 30 cm in
thickness, about 50 m downstream the outlet, and where exists a strong smell.
The heavy metal content of the substate decreases as the water gets deeper. Since the end of the
1960's or early 1970's when the South Trunk Sewer was built and put into operation, pollutants in
the sewage have been vertically deposited, transported and have accumulated in the sand and clay
on the shore for over twenty years. The substrate has been polluted to a depth of 0.5 m.
The substrate of the river channel on the side of the outlet, has also been polluted by the sewage
discharged from the Bailonggang outlet, but that on far side of main channel seems basically free
of contamination ( Table 4 10 ).

*      Micro-organism                                   -
The count of colifornns at the Bailonggang outlet is in order of 10' ind. exceeding the limit of the
Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Water (I x 104/L). The number in the river centre is
smaller than that near the shore. The total bacterium count is about 10'-104/l, two or three orders
higher than the coliforTn counts.
*      Plankton
The biomass of algae species in tha w2ter is greatly affected by the light and by nutrient salts.
Chlorophyll (a) in the Changiang Estuary was measured, the result was then converted to
biomass. Compared with the resuits from aboratory incubating tests, the biomass measured on
site was much smaller, which shows that the poor light transmittance because of high silt content
has restricted the growth and production of algae, thus preventing the occurrence of red tides.
There were 12 phytoplankton species, 13 crustacean species and 7 wheel animalcule species found
in the Changjiang estuary. The major species are shown in Table 4.11

In this community, some of the species live polluted environments and some live in clean
environments. Most of the commnunity consist of both species.
*      Benthos
Benthos are resident biota because of their almost total immobility. Benthic diversity and biomass
can to some extent reflect the environmental quality at their habitats.

There are about 60 large benthos found on the beach at Bailonggang, 32 crustacean, 12 mollusca
and annelids, 2 aquatic insects and 2 other species. Of these. 4 species Jive in the polluted
environment, such as Brancliura sowerbyri and LAmbriculus sp etc. Some are fresh water species
such as Corbicula fluminea etc. Some species ( about 18 ) are in the rather salty fresh water
environment and there are other 18 species that live in dilute salty water, the number of which is
small.
Table 4.12 illustrates the diversity index distributions of macro-invertebrate benthos over different
months when samples were taken. By comparing the diversity inde-x distnbutions for the whole
year, or comparing the monthly diversity indices, one can see clearly that the Nr.4 sanipling
point is the location with most serious pollution, and next is Nr.3 sampling point. Nr.7 sampling
point has little pollution. This fact shows that the sewage discharged from the outlet on the shore
is dispersed but remains, damaging the bio-species living near the shore and resulting in small
diversity indices.

The Changliang Estuary is one of the major fishing grounds in China with over 100 fish species.
The main commercial fish include Coilia mystus, Coilia ectenes and Hemisalan Prognathus. which

*      Bio-accumulation Effects
Conenmation of heavy metals accumulated in the Corbicula fluminea could show the level and
range of impacts from sewage discharged at the oudet. Figure 4.6 illustrates the distnrbution of
heavy metals in the Corbicula fluminea sampled at the intertidal zones up and down the outlet of
the South Sewer System.
The act umulation of heavy meals in fish is less serious than that of the bentios ( Table 4.13),
excepting Zinc which exceeds the food standards.

The vertical patrn of heavy metals show that their concentration in animal bodies is higher than
that in mud samples, which in tunm is higher than that in water samples. Heavy metals carried by
the sewage are adsorbed on the suspended solids in water bodies and then settled on the river bed.
They will be accumlated in the bodies of benthos through gills or as food.
4.2.2.5 River Bed Stability
Since the 1950s, the South Branch of the Changjiang Estuary has been subject to serious scouring
and siltation, and there has been great change in the flow and silt load in the South Channel.
During the period 1961 to 1985. a mono channel has been developed into a complex chanrel, and
the river bed morphology has also changed gready and formed Ruifengshazui and Yawosha shoal.
In the South Channel, two deep troughs have formed, called Main Trough and Changxing Flood
Tide Trench of the South Cha-nnel.
The South Channde Main Trough was formed in the course of steady evolution of the South
Channel from a mono- to complex channels. The Soutd Chamel Main Trough has -10 m in depth,
and was extended during the period from 1971 to 1976, at an average stretch of about 1.4 Ian

each year, and during the period from 1976 to 1985, the average annual extension rate was 277
m.
The variation in depth at the section where the outlet of the existng Southern Trunk Sewer is
located shows that river bed scouring and siltation occurs ( Table 4.14, Figure 4.7). Table 4.10
illustrates the maximum scouring.
At Bailonggang, the boundary between beach and trough is very obvious; the area within 1 km
from the shore is th river beach, and the area between 1.0 - 2.2 km from the shore is atransition
zone with slope of about 1 %. The river bed within 3.0 km of the shore is stable with maximum
scouring and siltation of 3.7 m, while the river bed 3.5 km away from the shore is subject to a
wide range of scouring reaching - about 9 m.
Note that baselines of the cross-sections at the existing Southern Trunk Sewer outfall and the
proposed outfall are about 300 m in distance and that of laner is situated outer.

6.1          Options for Wastewater Treatment
6.1.1        Objectives for Effluent Disharge
In accordance with the National Integrated Standard for Wastewater Discharge ( GB8978-88),
pollutants are grouped into two categories based on the their nature. Pollutants of the First Category
are mainly metals which nay be accmulated in animals and plants and have adverse impacts an
public health. The Standards require these pollutmts to be controlled at the site where the are
generated. In practical terms. it is very difficult to remove them from effluents using conventional
bio-chemical processes, and they should be controlled on site. Pollutants of the Second Category
refers to the substnces whose long-term effect is less harmful than the Category One pollutants. The
Maximum concentration limits for the Second Category pollutants are illustrated in Table 6.1.

6.1.2 Analysis of Effluent Treatment Eficiency
6.11 Prdimuaiy Treatent
Preliminary treatment consists of screeng and grit removal in aerated chambers. The objective is
to remove large and/or abrasive materials that could clog or damage the downstrm  facilities. There
is little removal of BOD or other polutant parameters.
Fmdings fom a study by East China Normal University show that it is accpetable to discharge 2.8
million m&/day with a BOD load of 294 tld at Bailonggang. The water quality up to 6 km downstream
will be over the background values whilst teding to the background level beyond 6 lkm from the
outlet. As the actual flow of SSPII is 1.7 million m3/day and the average BOD load 145 t/d, the
impact will be even smaller. This means that preliminary tremet should be acceptable for SSPII.
More specific discussion of the impact on the Changjiang Estuary. is presented in Chapter 7.
6.1.2.2 Primary Trea_mt Effideuty
Primary treatment processes include sedimentation to reemove suspended solids and digestion of the
sludge produced. For SSP II, the design includes twelve sedimentaion tanks, each 60 m in diameter
with 4 m water depth and an effluent retention time of 1.5 hrs. Pollutant removal efficiencY for the

Table 6.3 shows that the BOD5 concentration in the tred effluent is 64 mg/I. which does not quite

6.1.2.3 Effiiency of Chenically Enhanced Primaay Tr.a_ent
Prior to the sedme on tanks, the pretreated wasewarer would be dozed with Alumminium or iron
salt. ASter nixing, the wastewater would pass through a saries of sedinienation tanks for coagulation
and sedomentation. In order to ensure thorough mxmg, the chemicals should be bighly diluted
before being added ( in dte US, the concenation of chemicals used in sewage treatment works is 20 -
35 ppm, and in Norway, 100 - 200 mg/A).
Under normal conditions, with adequate operation and maitenance. the removal efficieny could be
improved to the level that meets the national standards. Table 6.4 gives details.

6.1.2.5 Sludge Digestion Effciency
Sludge from the sedimernon umks usually contain large amounts of organic material and bacteia.
As the sludge has a noxious smell and is unstable, further treatnt is required, for example
anaerobic digestion and dewatering before disposal.
Anaerobic digestion is one of the most effective bio-chemical methods for breaking cells. In addition.
it removes large amounts of organic substances. The main consituents of anaerobic gases are CH,
and COj

The gas composition (volume ratio) could be:

CH, (methane) produced during the digestion process in sewage trmen works can equally be
colected and used as a fiul for domestic heating and for heating sludge. lhe moisture content of

Appraisal Repon - VoImc .Enviro,uread Assesut
It can be seen from Table 6.8 that the cost of prelminary raument is estimated to be 130 million
Yuan, or about 14 percent of the cost of primary treatment works. The cost of secondary treatment
works would be almost tree times dtat of the primary treabent works.
Studies havc shown that dissolved oxygen and BOD5 levels in the Changjiang esmuary have not
become a serious problem, therefore control of BOD5 could be postponed to a later stage. If primary
tatment is adopted BOD% in the trated effluent would not meet the maximin liniit in the Dischge
Standards. The secondary treatment option capital cost would be higher than that of the enhanced
primary treatent option. Nutnent levels and red tides are not a problem in the Changjiang estuary,
although their impact on the East China Sea remains unucrtain. Although the pollution contribution
of Shanghai compared with the tomi load from the Changjiang Basin is limited, more control over
nutrients is needed. In addition, control of phosphorus should be considered. Compared with
secondary treatment, enhanced primary treatuent is more effective in removing phosphorus - the
removal rate could reach 85 percent - and therefore, it is a priority option. At present, therefore the
preliminary treatment opdon sbould be considered, but land should be reserved for future use if an
increase in treatment levels are required.
6.2     Options for Sludge Diposal
The following methods were considered to be of particular interest for disposal of sludge from a
possible sewage treatment plant at Bailonggang:
1.   Utilization in agricultre
2    Application on land
3    Landfill
4    Inineration.
The priority option may be the utlization in agriculture, on condition that there is sufficient farmland
available and the quality of the sludge is acceptable ( in compliance with related standards). If not,
landxfl may be the best option.
Disposal of sludge at sea has been practised by some countries, but international conventions are
restricing this option. In an international perspective dumping of sludge at sea will be controversial
and is not recommended.
The focus concerned for sludge disposal is: (1) no adverse consequence to be imposed on the
environment from the sludge disposed of; (2) availability of adequate space for the disposal of sludge.
if the sludge is to be disposed by delivering to rem   areas by barges or trucks, it will be found
difficult and less reliable in practical operadon. It is therefore recommended that the final disposal
of sludge should be witin the Shangai Municipality.

Treatment will be required before fial disposal of sludge. Expected treatment requirements and
corresponding dispodal principles are indicated in Table 6.9.
Anaerobic digestion and thermal treatnent will reduce sludge volume and improve the environmental
and hygicnic conditions for final disposal, while mechanical dewatering will reduce the sludge volume
and change its consistency firom liquid to pasty/solid condition.

Operational reliability/ availability
Suainability. 
These critria are discussed below for each disposal option. The total cost of both treatment and
disposal has to be taken into account when comparing the different options. The investment items are
listed below.
6.2.4   Utization in Agriculture
_nent Requremas
The main invesment componens will be:
Anaerobic digestion facilities
Mechanical dewatering
Wharf at Bailonggang
Barges and tmcks
Landfill and storage areas
Environmental and hygienic acceptability
Sludge disposal n agricultue and forestry will utilize the positive value of the sludge as feizer or
soil conditioner. lTe enviromental acceptability depends on low values of heavy metals and toxic
components. Industries with such discharges should have separate waste water treatment plants.
At present agriculture has a low level of m in, and spreading and ploughing in the sludge
will, to a large degree, bc carried out by te farmers and a special task force. The workrs will be
exposed to possible gas and toxic components in the sludge.
A comprehensive control and monitoring system has to be established to ensure environmental and
hygienic safety
Transportation of the sludge will cause some air pollution. Run-off from the famdand vnll cause some
pollution, but this can be limited by proper storage and spreading procedures.
Flexibiiy
National Standard (GB 4284-84) sets the maximum quantity of dry sludge at 30 t/ha per year. This
will restrict the flexibility of the availability of farmland.
Land requirement assuming secondary tretment in Phase L has been estimated as 50 kmDIy.

The Standard also requires a minmm of 20 years before application on the same soil if metal
concradons are dose to dte standard. The system has limited flexibility for sludge with high
concentrations of heavy metals, unless an emergency landfill is establishd.
Operational riabilit/ availabiity
A comprehensive management system is necessary in order to make the system operational, and to
facilitate cooperation with the large number of famers required to receive sludge.
A comprehensive control and monitoring system has to be established to ensure environmental and
hygienic safety.
As the sludge cannot be applied during the crop season, a paved area with retention walls for
temporary storage will be necessary. The size of the storage area will be dependant on the regime
agreed between the cropping periods and the sludge spreading activities.
The systemn is sensitive to any breakdown or failure at the sludge digestion and dewatering plant.
The transportation system is considered reliable, but the sludge will not be dry and the trucks will
need sidec walls to prevent spills.
A standby landfill will be required in case of interruptions in the tratnent process or in the
transportation system.
S2ustainxabiit
Sludge may not be used in drining water protection zones, or on rice or vegetable fields. This means
that most area of Shanghai is unfit for sludge disposal.

Evironmetal and hygiec acpbaility
Tbe physical and chemical c racteics of the sludge have to be monitored and controlied at the
treatment plant. The hygienic requiremnts have to be stricter, for disposal on amenity areas and
parks where the public has access, than for top dressing on secure landfill sites.
Flexibility
The quanities of siddge at each acceptable Ixation are larer than in option 1 and the requrements
in terms of physical and chermcal characteristics are also less sensitive. This option is therefore
relatively flexible.
Operational rdeiab lity/ availability
Each location can receive relatively large quanmities. The transportation system will be fairly snnple
to manage and operate Dried sludge has a texture like fine granular soil and can be rnsported by
ordinary trucks.
Even so. a standby landfil should be established next to the treatment plant to cater for possible
critical situations.
The system is sensitive to any breakdown or failure at the sludge digestion. dewatering and termal
treatment plant.
Sustinabity
There is. in general, a shortage of top soil in Shanghai. The basic sub-soil is silty clay which is often
used as top dressing material. The sludge could be an acoeptable source of mixing material which also
will improve the soil quality needed in any top layer.

Appris Report - Vohame 4:EmiromnentalAsanent
If the landfill has to be established away from the treatment plant, additional investnents will be
required in the following units:
Wharf at Bailonggang
Barges
Enyfronmental and hygienic acceptabity
LandfiHling of sludge is commonly regarded as enviromnenLal acceptable if necessay design and
opautional actions are taken to mimize the impacts. These actions include:
The use of fill material other than sludge below the ground water table
Sealing the area to prevent water tntrsion or leachate escape
The coUection and piping of the leachate to the treamnent plant
The collection and ventilation of explosive gases to avoid the risk of explosion or health
hazards to workers
Seaing the final surface and covering with top soil.
Disposal of primay sludge will generate gases. particularly hydrogen sulphide (H2S) which is
maodorous. In order to reduce the odour problem, the sludge could either be stabilized by anaerobic
digestion or temporarily stabilized by using lime for conditioning before dewatering. Sludge stabilized
by lime will however generate ammonia (NH3) which also has a pungent smell, but is generally more
acceptable.
Flemibility
This option has considerable flexibility. The landfill site should be developed in separate cells, and
provided sufficient capacity is available, varnation in quanmties will only bring forward or delay
development of the ncxt cell.The landfiU option is not scnsitive to the content of heavy metals or toxic
components.
The landfill may also accept sludge from other domestic waste water treatment plants.
Operationa ribiityl availability
The management and operation of a landfill is simple compared to the other disposal options. A
particular benefit is that the treatment and disposal site would both be located at Bailongng. The
most critical opemion is fte leachate treatment plant, but this would be handled by pumping the
leachate to- the inlet at the waste water treatment planL
A second option would be to develop a separate landfill for sludge next to the existing landfill at
Laogang for domestic solid waste. The sludge wil have to be barged and a wharf wil have to be

constructed at Bailonggang.
There is considerable landfill capacity at Bailonggang, but in futire it will be necessary to establish
a separate landfill possibly further south along the coast line. A possible location is next to the
Laogang landfill for domestic solid waste. The landfill is operated by SESAB, and managerial and
opeaional benefits could be achieved by cooperation. There wiDl also be environmental benefits by
locating different landfills in die same area.
Sediment deposition from the Chengjiang River is exeding the coastline in some areas by 40-60 m
every year. The land could be reclaimed and filled to 4-6 m above sea level, and utilized as farmland
or for other purposes. This provide a great potentiaI for landfilUing of waste and sludge.
627   lIncineration
Investment Requirements
The main investment components will be:
Mechanical dewatering
nineraton plan
Landfill
Trucks
Enviromnental nd hygienic acceplity
The most important environmental isme related to inc a     is air pollution. The quantity and
quality of the emission is dependent on the incineration process, the flue gas treatmem, the sludge
composition and the use of auxiliary fuel. ncineration is regarded as an acceptable method provided
the air pollution is controlled and in acrdanc with environmental standards.
The hygienic conditions at an incineration plant and at the associated slag landfill are considered to
be good compared with the other disposal options.
Flexibility
An incineration plant has very limited flexibility in terns of changes in capacity. The process shouid
be operated at its design capacity to achieve efficient combustion and efficient flue gas treatment.
Some flexibility could be bmuit into storage capacity and operational hours per week but standby
landfill would bc requred and the design would have to be on the basis of a reliable minimum sludge
throughput until figures for sludge quantities are well established, ie after the treatment works has
been in operation for some time.

Appraisl Report- Volume 4:E1virouemcl Assssm
The incineration plant is also sensitive to the dry contnt of the dewatmed sludge. If the dewatering
process is inefficient, dbe amount of supporting fuel has to be increased. Combustion of_sludge of
30% dry solids (DS), for example, will require 0.01 kg oil/kg DS while shldge of 15% DS will
require 0.50 kg oil/kg DS.
Operational rdiability/ avaiability
Historically, the opeational availability of waste incineration plants was 60-80 %. but modern plants
clain to need less doWnime. Nevertheless, the plant will need overhaul and repair at regular inervals
and a landfill will be needed. The slag and ashes could partly be utilized as road filling material or
other purposes.
Incineration could be considered as a sludge treatment process since the inorganic material reins
as slag and ashes, which require final disposal.
Sustainability
Provided reliable sludge quantities are available the incineration plant can be planned, designed and
constructed with confidence. The incineator can be rehabilitated and extended as the need arises, and
is considered to be a sustainable option.
Landfill requirements wil be limited and the area available at Bailonggang will last longer.
6.2.8   Comparison of Disposal Options
The different selection criteria are not direcdy comparable, but have becn described in qualitative
terms in the sections above. An indicative comparison is given in the table below by raning the
diposal options, with five stars considered to be the best option.
The options have different advantages, but landfill seans to be the most appropriatc choice. It should
be noted that standby landfl will also be needed at all options.
Utilization in agriculture and land application are considered optimal from an envirounmemal point of
view, but will have the highest health risk.
Incineration could be an option in fiture.

Because of the uncerintes regarding flows and wastewat characteristics, it is recommended that
an option reqirmg  nimnm investment, and mimum  flexibility and rdiability is seleted.
Therefore sludge disposal by landfill is recommended, to be developed in the following sequences:
Step I EstabFlish landfill at Bailonggang. Develop the landfill in separate cells (eg 125m x 400kn x
4m).
Mechanical dewateing by belt presses or filter presses with lime or other conditioner.
Landfill to be commissioned at the same time as the waste water treatment plant.
Step 2  Monitoring of sludge quantities and characteristics.
Enforce and monitor separate wastewater treament facilities at industries disharging
unacceptable quantities/ concenations of heavy metals or toxic materials.
Detailed investigation of the potential for sludge utilizatiun in agriculture and other
applications, and assess technical, managerial and financial implications.

7.     IMPACT ON WATER ENVIRONENT OF CHANGJIANG ESTUARY
7.1    Present Staus at BailOugang
In general, the Changjiang is designated as a Class II water in accordance with the environmenal
quality standard for surface water (GB3838-88). However, Bailonggang is at the confluence of
fresh and saline vater and because of dtis, and the high silt level carried by the river, it is not
always possible to naintain the Class 11 standard at Bailonggang. Even without discharges from
Shanghai, it would be difficult to maiain this standard. Also, during periods of low river flow,
saline intrusion nakes even the Class m standards difficult to achieve.
In addition, the Southern Conveyor discharges at Bailonggang. Originally designed in 1970 for a
flow qf 550,000 m3/day, the current discharge is 300,000 nil/day. Over the past twenty years, the
beaches upstream and downstream of Bailonggang have been seriously polluted because of the
direct discharge from the Southern Conveyor onto the beach at Bailonggang.
The Bailonggang area is a brackish water area, and the current water uses are identified as:
(1)    navigation;
(2)    flood control and drainage;
(3)    rmigratory passage for fish.
These fimctions must be bome in mind when considering the use of the Bailonggang waters for
disposal of the proposed 1,700,000 mn/day of wastewater- In the area of the proposed outfill, the
size of the mixing zone should be properly controlled so as to aintain sufficient area for fish
mnigration and thus mininiise the impact on fish and the beach area in general. Currently the south
channel and the south passage are the principal shipping lanes in the Changiang estuary. These
are scheduled to be dredged, and therefore, the position of the proposed outfall cannot be
extended beyond the slope into the deep water trench.
7.2    Waste Water Dilution and Mixig Zone
In order to estimate the extent of the mixing zone needed to meet Standard Category m, the
required dilution ratio of the pollutant must be defined.
The dilution ratio of the pollutant can be defined as:

From Table 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3, the minimum dilution multiple required for BOD5 and Total-P does
not exceed 50. The minimum dilution nmltiple for NH3-N was only 30 in high water season, but
reached 100 in low water season. However, if the dilution ratio S for waste water is calculated
using BOD5, dilution requirements, a dilution ratio of 50 is adequate.
The background value for CODQ, is relatively high, particularly in the low water season. This is
because of the water salinity and silt content

The table shows that for the near field simulations, three dimensional hydraulic and water quality
models have been used. whilst for the far field simulations two dimensional models were used
(Figure 7. 1).
The coordinate axes used are: X axis parallel to Chaliang   bank extending dowrstrm; Y axis
perpendicular to the river bank extending into the river; Z axis vertical to the water surface. The
calculation methods were: on X-Y plan. finite-volume method: on Z axis. difference method.
Using the Bailongging outfall as the centre point, an area was divided into 96 blocks (Figure 7.2).
The area of each block was about lOOOmxlOOOn. The network has three layers (O.OH, 0.6H,
l.OH). each layer has 125 grid points.
7.3.2    Tracer Test in Changjiang Estuary
Tracer testing is also an effective method of studying pollutant dispersion. Five tests were carried
out using Rhodamine B as the tracer agent (the initial concentration of Rhodamine B was
1x10'gIml. Mixed with water and non-poisonous solvent, the specific gravity is a little bit heavier
than that of water. For each test, 190 kg Rhodamine B solution was used).
During the test, the plume of tracer agent was tracked and samples taken at its centre. The whole
programme was video recorded, and wind direction and velocity were measured. Table 7.5 gives
details of the programme.

7A      Near Field Impact Analysis for Wastewater Disdarge
7A.1   Wastewater Mixing Zone
7A.1.1 Current Field Simulation of Near Fidd
The current state data were calculated over the period assuming two semi-diunal tides. Following
this a current field diagram was prepared. Figures 7.3 and 7.4 show the current field at fill flood
tide, slack flood tide, full ebb tide and slack ebb tide in both high water and low water seasons.
From the current field diagram, the velocity at 1000 meters distance from the river bank was a
naximum and the velocity vector was diffused, which is beneficial for pollutant dispersion.
7.4.1.2 Initial Dilution Process
When wastewater is discharged into the water body from the pipe jet with a vdocity higher than that
of receiving water body, the initial momentum forms a pure jet stream. In the initial phase of the
stream, the wastewater mixes with the water body to form a boundary layer, which gradually
increases from a line to an area. The velocity of the bbundary area gradually reduces, as the main
phase of the jet suream develops.
During the initial phase of the jet stream, the main factor for motion is jet momentum During the
nain phase in addition to the jet momentum, the buoyancy produced by the density difference
between the wastewater and the surrounding waver is also a factor. This phase is also called the
floating iet stream phase. There are two situations which apply to the continuing motion of the
floating jet stream: one is when the density difference still exists when the jet stream momentum
becomes zero. In this case the jet stream. mnotion will cease at the point at which the density difference
disappears; the second situation is when the jet stream momentum remnains when the density difference
disappear. In this case the jet stream motion ceases when remaining momentum is dissipated.
The initial dilution refers to the whole process during which the wastewater moves in the form of a
jet stream (including the floating jet stream). At the end of this stage, the wastewater is continuously
mnxing with the surrounding water, reducing its concentration. The factors affecting the initial dilution
stage include the discharge velocity and rate, the density distrbution and hydraulic patterns of water
the body (levels of salinity and/or tamperature and their stratification, current velocities and their
gradients) and the physical properties of the wastewater.
The initial dilution factor is v-ry imporant for the further mixing and dilution of the wastewater with
the surrounding water body. At Bailonggang. the river is relatively shallow and the water is generally
fresh water, but with relatively high salinity in the low water season. The initial dilution factor is
estimated to be about 20.

7.4.1.3 Estimatioa of Sewage Ming Zone
Table 7.6 shows the area of mixing zone calculated using the mathematical model for a
wastewater discharge of 1,700,000 nId with a diffuser length of 240 m under various
hydrological conditions. Because a dilution factor of 50 is sufficient for the wastewater at
Bailonggang, the mixmg zone is assmned to be that area where the dilution, S is less than 50.
From the table, the area of the mixing zone is between about 0.5 kmn to 3.2 km2. The most
unfavourable hydrologic condition is neap tide during the drought seson. The most unfavourable
stage of the tidal cycle is slack flood tide and initial ebb tide.
The three levels of flow at Datong Hydrographic Station represent the extrem drought, drought
and average seasons respectively. At the end of the dry season and the beginning of the rainy
season (around May and June), the flow in the Changjiang has resumed an average condition. In
this condition the pollution load of the initial rnoff following showers is usually very high.
Assuming that the initial runoff load is double that of the sewage strength, the potental impact of
such a shock load on the water body at the discharge point may be estimated by considering the
size of the mixing zone with a dilution factor of less than 100. It can be seen in Table 7.6 that
area of the mixing zone is still less than 3 km2.
It should be noted that a physical model has also been used to simulate the mixing purpose. The
results showed that the mixing zone with a dilution less than 50 nay be in a range of 0.08 - 18
km2. This is significantly different from the estimate frm the nathematical model. The difference
may be related to the exaggerated distortion and other factors of the physical model.
rne length and layout of the diffuser section(s) are to be optimised so that a further improvement
of the near-field environment at the outfall site may be expected.

7.4.1.4 R            for Extent of W    _twate MixEg Zone
There are three conditions to be satisfied to ensure that the wasewater discharge does not affect
the environmental conditon of the receiving water during the nmxing process. The three
conditions are: 'no rising to the surfice, 'no sinking to the bottom' and 'no reaching the shore'.
The first condition requires that during the process of mixing the probability of pollutant rising to
the surface of the water should be controlled to a minim
The second condition requires that during the process of rnixng the risk of pollutant touching the
riverbed in the process of transportation and dispersion should be reduced as much as possible.
The result from the analysis of the initial dilution stage is that provided that the angle (eO) of the
diffuser port axis with the horizontal is about 150. then the risk of pollutant reaching the rivabed
is almost zero. However, even if there is any deposition of suspended solids on the riverbed, the
normal processes of river bed transport are likely to remove the pollution, thus minimizing the
likelihood of riverbed pollution.
The third condition requires that the frquency of the mixing zne reaching the shoreline is
eliminated as far as possible so as to reduce the impact of the discharge on the shore.

7.4.2   ProbabIlity of Wastewat  Rising to the Surfae
This pmbability of pollutant rising to the surface of the water body is represented by:
P = a PIP2
Pi represents the slack flow velocty probability of the total flow; P2 represents the probability of
rising to the surface caused by density difference; a represents a weighted factor related to the
waste water discharge.
Table 7.7 shows the probability of wastewater rising to the surface under different conditions for a
diffuser angle of 15D_

Diameter of diWfisr port, the jet velocity is 3.5 ni/s.
From this table, the probabilty of the waswaer rising to the surface under Chengijang River
dischare flow conditions of 7000 m3/s (H=5). 10000 m?/s (H=7) and 30000 m3/s (H=9) with a
discharge quantity of 1,700,000 m3/d is 2.7%, 1.8% and 1.4% respectively. It can therefore be
assumed that genealy the probability of rising is under 5% when the waste water discharge
quantity is 1,700,000 meld.
7.4.3   Probability of Wastewater Reaching the Shore
From the current feld diagram, it can be seen firsdy, there is a coastward current at ebb tide and
a cenpetal flow at flood tide, both related to the tide direction and velocity as well as the shape
of the coastline at Bailonggang; secondly, there are two kinds of rotary flow. clockwise and anti-
clockwise, which can affect the distrbution of pollutant concentraon at the seashore; thirdly,
becmase of the variability of the flow field, the distribon of pollutnt can also be
inhomogeneous.
Table 7.8 shows the estimated values of distance and contact occurrence between the boundary of
the mixing zone and the shore under different hydrological conditions.

For S=50, contact occurece is always zero. For S=100, the contact occurrence under ebb tide

7.4.4 Estimate of Upstream and Dowtream Impact
After three adal periods, pollutant discharged from Bailongng will not return to the area. The
tidal action will ensure the pollutant is dispersed into the East China Sea via the South Passage
and the North Passage and the South Chamel.
Taking 1% incremet of the baseline COD concentation, say ACL=0.1 mg/l, as a criterion for
predicting the range to be affected by the sewage discharge, the estimated value of maximum
distance from the Bailonggang outfall under diferent hydrologic conditions. is shown on Table
7.9 (Waste water dischage quantity 1,700,000 mrid).

Figures 7.5 and 7.6 show the Rhodamine B trcer test result. It can be seen that the dilution and
diffusion multiple after one hour is above 102-103. The concentration of COD at the existing
Bailouggang sewage outlet is about 300 mg/l Calculated using an average velocity of 0-82 mg/l.
the distance is about 3000 m while the wastewater is diluted to 0.3 mg/l. This simation tallies with
the calculation result.
Bailonggang is experiences about two semi-diurnal tides a day (about 24 hours and 50 minutes in
total). The flood current could push back the mixed riverwater and sewage discharged during the
ebb tide. Such a flow reversal may cause overlapping of the inadequately diluted sewage thus
increasing the retention period in the outfall reach.
7.4.5 Ftimate of Wastewater Retention Time
The retention time for the water body at Bailonggang is about 0.6-1.7 days depending upon the
season (see Table 7.10).

effectively reduced to the basline standard after initial dilution and near field dispersion, before
discharge from the Chanjiang estuary. During this period. pollutas reaching the estuary from
upstream of the Changjiang River, mix with the SSPUI pollution load and are transported to sea.

sinmlation, the result being quite simiar.
7.5.2   Wastewater Transport
Tidal oscillation in the Changriang estuary and Hangzhou Bay is mainly a harmonic oscillation catused
by the Pacific tidal current spreading towards the coast of China. The semi-diurnal tidal currt from
the Pacific Ocean spreads southeast to northwest and maiains its forward movement afterentering
the area. The componen of tidal current are distributed in an eUiptic path: the major axis in the outer
sea being in a SE-NW direction and the major axis in the Changjiang estuary and near Hangzhou Bay
is towards the estuary. Outside the estary, the maximum velocity for component of tidal current
is reached at high tide. This is the main characteristic of the forward curt In the inner sea area,
the maximum velocty of tidal current occurs about one hour before both high tide and low tide,
therefore, it has the characterstic of both a forward wave and a standing wave.
The tidal charcteisics in this area is semi-diumal and irregular semi-diurnal tides. The wvater
currents in the outer sea cirulate clockwise. Tides flow maily SE-NW back-and-forth near the
Changijang estuary and mainly E-W back-and-forth within Hangzhou Bay. The ebb tide and flood tide
in the Changjiang estary and Wusong Kou last 6.5 hours and 6 hours respecively. The residual
current within the estary is towards the east, near the csuary it is to the north and outside of the
estuary it is mainly towards the north east. The average magnitude of the residual current is 25 cm/s
(Figure 7.9).
Calculation shows that after 100 days a labelled particle to the east of Nanhui moves out of the
calculation area; a labelled particle te the south of Hengsha remains almost static after moving
towards southeast about 20 km; and anoter labelled paricle to the northeast of Hengsha tansferred
into the Changjiang estuary from south after moving towards the east.
7.S.3   Pollutant Transformation
The proposed Bailonggang outfall will be located in the brackish-water confluence of the Cbangliang
estuary. These waters have a complex hydrochemical enviromnent due to the waste water discharge.
But with the dilution and dispersion to pollutants by the tidal current and with the aggregation,
settlement, diffusion and transporation of fine silt as well as the degradation of organic pollutams.
these waters have a good physico-chemical self-purification capacity for pollutants. There is a strong
self-cleaning zone from 20 km upstm  of the Bailonggang to Jigu Jiao in the Changjiang estuary.
The silt content is very high in the turbid waters, with the surface and bottom layer 0.2-0.7 kg/in3
and 1-8 kg/n3 respectively, someimes over 10 kg/m3 and even can form floating mud layers. In
addition to hydrodynamic factors, the mixing of saline water and fresh water in the estuary also
speeds up the setdement of fine silt. Part of the sediments setded at the bottom layers of these waters
wiU become mobile matrial and be transported outward, the another part will be suspended again
due to storm action and be setded for tansportaton again. According to the diffusion-advection-

reaction model, part of the sements settle down to the sea floor due to early mineisation so as to
take effect for the purification. Wgth regard to heavy mnal ions, becau  of dte chmical purification
in turbid zone, basically there is no heavy metal pollution in the East Chinu Sea and part of organic
substances are also purified.
The pmary existing form of dissolved phosphorus in thi. Changjiang water body appears as inorganic
phosphate, with low organic phosphorus content. The concenraion is generally to around 0.015-
0.016 mg/l. However, at depths under 7m in Hangzhou Bay there is a high value zone with dissolved
phosphorus conent up to 0.046-0.063 mg/i. Therc is no direct relationship with the Changjiang river
discharge flow, but closely relates to the water body's higb suspended silt content 10004000 mg/l.
The concentration of the sea area in the east of Chongming Island is less than 0.016 mg1l with an
obvious biotransfer mechanism.
The concentration of NH3-N in Changjiang esuary reduce gradually from 0.08 mg/I to 0.02 mg/I
with increased distance from the cstuary.  It shows that the self-purification function is fairly
obvious. Most organic substnces existing in the Changjiang water decompose into types of nutrient
salt. Consequently it is unlikely that they will be brought into the East China Sea as organic
subsutces or organic solid maes and the possibility of becoming organic pollution source is
extremely siall.
7.6    Potential Empact on Eclogical Environment
7.6.1   Inprovement of Ecological nvionment in the lotertidal Zone
The existing soutdhe  tnmk oudat is located on the seasbore at Bailoaggang. Wastewater is not
quicldy diluted and diffused, but is retained in the intertidal zone and forms a black slick which
seriously affects the ecological enviroment. The proposed Bailonggang outlet for SSP II will utlise
submerged diffusers and will include the exsting soutdh  trunk discarge. Therefore, -the pollution
sources in the Bailonggang intertidal zone will be greatly reduced, and with the interaction between
river discharge flow and tidal flow, the whole enviromment at Bailonggang will gradually recover.
In addition. with the improvement in the inuteridal condition the threat to adjacent rivers will also be
reduced.
7.6.2 Impact on Near Field Ecological Enviromnent
Because submerged diffusers are proposed for the SSPH outfall at Bailonggang, the quantity of
microorganisms such as coliform in the water at Bailonggang will be reduced.
The community and popglation of phytoplankton is related to the water body's salinity, temperAture,
transmissiviy, concentration of nutrient salt and toxic agents. However, there will not be any distinct

change to the above factors by virtue of the submerged diffusers, and no distinct change for the
population and quantity of phytoplankton. There may even be some increase in the above factors in
the mixing zone, although this effect will be greatly reduced because of tidal action and movement
of mixing zone.
The same applies to zooplankton. Since the zooplankton is also closely related to these factors,
therefore, the ecological impact on zooplatiton will be minor.
Because of the strong river flow and tidal flow in the Changjiang estuary, the wastewater discharge
can be quickly diluted so that the hazard to fish is reduced. According to tests, if LC,,xO. I for 96
hours is taken as the safe concentration, there is a degree of safety to fish when the dilution of the
wastewater for 25 times. The initial dilution is estimated to be 20, and the dilution factor outside the
mixing zone will be more than 50. Thus, the fishery water standard will be met. The mixing zone
will be very small in relation to the Changjiang estuary, therefore the impact in the near field is quite
small.
7.6.3   Impact on Far Field Ecological Enviromtent
Because the proposed outfall will be submerged diffusion, the impact on the far field enviro.nment will
be lower than that of a beach discharge. The principal reason is that the wastewater wil: be
sufficiendy diluted to reduce more distant impacts to low levels. The fishery resources spawning
areas inthe Changjiang estury are at Tongsha, Jiuduansha and Nanhuizui, about 15 kan distance from
the Bailonggang waters. There will be no impact from the discharge on these areas.
7.6A    Pbssibiity of Eutrophication in the Cbaugiang Estary
Plankcton absorbs nutrients in fixed proportion, normally NIP U 16-18. In the Changjiang River
catchment area, nitrogen run off from farmland produces high levels of nitrogen on the river.
However, because of there is insufficient phosphorus in the surface lithosphere and because of
improper fertlizer application proportions, the potassium and phosphorus levels are in unbalance with
the nitrogen level, resulting in NIP levels of 20-127. However, be, muse of the high suspended particle
content in the river estuary and becase te silt content is around 0. 1-0.5 kg/&n in the area within a
20 m bathometric contour and with a saliity of beow 30Ie. the hlgh value of N/P will not affect the
plankton or the ecological environmen. Because of the buffer action of phosphorus and the dilution
of nitrogen in the marine environment, reduced N/P values of less than 20 produce no eutrophication
even though the turbidity of the water is reduced.
It should be noted that the output of nutrients from Shanghai discharged to tie Changjiang River are
less than 3% of the total river load. Altcugh future control is certainly necessary, waste water
discharge from the proposed SSPH outfall will bc unlikely to affect the ecological evronment in the

7.7    Impact Prediction for Eniromnental Senitve Object
7.7.1   Possible Impact on Hanughou Bay
Flows from the Changjiang River together with the man-made pollutant loads enter the marine
environment in a southeast direction to around 1220 15'E. turning to the northeast in summner and to
sout;icast in winter: There is generaliv no great impact on Hangzhou Bay. Even if a surface crret
flows southwards in Hangzhou Bay, forwards the Zhoushan Fishing Ground, because of dilution, it
is estimated that the accumulated conwntration of COD is about 0.05 mgll at Shensi and Zhoushan,
even without considering any self-purification process.
In summer, the diluted water flows about 124E. It affects the nearby areas of northemn Jiangsu
Province to some extent, but the main flow does not directiy reach the Liisi coastal area Fromn the
results of other measurements, the currents in the Lilsi coastal area are mainly controlled by the
coastal currents of northern Jiangsu Province.
The main fish spawning grounds are some distance from the proposed Bailonggang sewage outfall
(about 20 kIn). A dilution of several thousands times is afforded to the effluent after such a distance.
Therefore, there will be no great impact on spawning grounds.
7.7.2  Impact on Water Intakes m the Changiang Estuary
The Changjiang estary also provides potable water for Shanghai city. The largest existing water
source is the Chenhang intake, located upstream of the Baosan Iron & Steel Complex, about
40 krn away from the proposed sewage outfall. The planned Qincaosba vwater intake is about 30 kIn
from the proposed Bailonggang outlet. It can be considered that there is no impact on the existing and
planned water intakes.
7.7.3   Possible Inpact on Inland Water Diversion
Water quality will be improved after constuction of the Bailonggang outlet because the proposed
outlet will replace the existing 300,000 m3Jd beach outlet. Even though the volume of waste water
discharged will be increased to 1,700,000 m3/d, the impact on the seashore must be greatly reduced
by using the Changjiang water body's self purification capability. The main water diversion site
Wuhaogou and Sanjia Gang, are 10 Iam and 5 In frm the proposed Bailonggang oudet respectively.
Thus, the SSP D outfall wil not have any significant impact on inland water diversion. In fact, the
Changjiang water at Bailonggang is not suitable for inland diversion because of its high silt content
and the high salinity in iow water season.

7.7A   Possible Impact an Shanghai Pudoug Nr 2 Int1rationa Airport
Ihe Bailonggang sewage outfll is nmore than 10 Ima frn SlIInghai Pudong Nr 2 International
Airport. According to estimates, the impact of the waste water discharge is only apparent within 5
kin, the probability of surface effects is under 5%. and the mixing zone area is less than 3.2 km2.
Therefore, this project will not cause any significant impact on the airporL On the contrary, the visual
impression will be improved by the removal of the black water zone caused by the existing Southern
outfall.
7.8    Summary of the Impact on the Aquatic Environment
7.8.1   Use of the Water Body
mhe identified uses of the estuary at Bailonggang are: navigation, flood control and drainage, and
migratory passage for fish. Adopting the proposed submerged diffuser systen, it is feasible to prevent
pollution and meet the requirements of water use in this area.
7.8.2 Mixng Zone of Sewage
Based on numerical modelling of the proposed outfall, the mixmg zone in which dilution of the
sewage is no grea  than 50, is predicted to be around 0.5 to 3.2 knm in area. The most
unfavourable hydrological condition would bc a neap tide durng drought season, and the most
unfavourable tidal condition would be the high slack to early ebb condition.
7.8.3 Area Affected
The probability of inadequately diluted sewage affecting the water surface is be all below 5%; and
of affecting the -2 m bathometic contour is zero. The limit of waters affected by the sewage
discharge would be dependent upon hydrologic conditions, but would be within a range of 2 to 5 kan
from the discharge point.
7.8A   Acceptability of the Sewage Discharge and Polution Control
There is a strong self-purification eavironment in the Changjiang estuary, including physical.
chemical, and multi-interface bio-geochemical processes. The pollutants discharged from sewage
outfall will quickly be assimilated so that a satisfictory aquatic environmental quality is maintained.
It is clear that the dissolved oxygen in the Changljiang estuary is always at such a level, that oxygen-
consuming pollutn  have never become a serious problem. Thus, conventional pollutants could be
controlled under a total loading limit within which no adverse envirnmental consequence would be
expected. Loads from the SSPII outfall could be calculated, based on the design flow and stegth

as follows:
5-day Biochemical Oxygen Ddnand (BOD5)         190 ttday
Chemical Oxygen Denad (COD)                    422 ttday

Total Phosphorus                                7 ttday
This does not imply that these loads arc dhe ultinate capacity of the Changjiang esauary, but should
be regarded as a cotrol limit of total loading for this project. In fact, the assimilative capacity of
the estuary is much higher than the load detailed above as evealed by other studies elsewhere, so that
there is room for the next stages of the project and for fiutre development. However land should be
reserved for futue upgrading of the tatmen facilities when more stringent regulations are proposed.
Toxic and harmful substances are, however, required to be controlled because of their persistence in
the enviroment and because they may become enrained in the food chain.
7.8.5   Ecological Implication
The submerged outfall diffuser system would reverse the deteriorating intertidal ecosystem. caused
by the exisdng sewage outfall at Bailonggang, and would be unlikely to disturb the existing ecological
conditions in the Changjiang estuy and give rise to an impact on planlcton. As the mixing zone of
the sewage would be localised, the risk of damaging fishes would be minimised so that there woud
be few adverse effects on the fishery resources in Chanagiang estuary. Due to the special bio-
geochemical processes in the esary, the sewage discharge would be unlikely to induce a problem
of eutrophication.
7.8.6   Potent  Effects on Environmuntally Sensitive Objects
The proposed outfall at Bailonggang would have few impacts on the environmentally sensitive objects
in the Changjiang estuary, for example water intakes, water diversions for inland waterway
replenishment, the proposed PUdong Nr.2 lnteational Airport, etc. Benefit would result from
eliminating the black plume occumng along the coast, improving the water quality and visual
appearance in the vicinity of the proposed outfall compared with the existing interidal discharge of
sewage.

8.           IMPACT ON INLAND ENVIJONMENT
8.1          Predicted Qu91ily of Inand Water Enironment
The proposed SSPII project will intercet, rsport and dscharg into the sea both the effluent which
is now discharged into the inland water system and the efluent which is planned to be discharged in
the future. Tberefore, the proposed system will not result in any increase in the pollution load into
the existing inland water system. On the contrary, it will reduce the pollution load, leading to an
improvement in the quality of the water environment.
8.1.1        Water Quality Model of River Network
The area affected by the project is a dense and complex river network. Two models have been used
to predict water quality. The Huangpu River is a tidal river and therefore tides have a significat
effect on pollution iP the water bodies. Because of this, a dynanic water quality model of the river
network has been used to predict the water quality of the Huangpu River, Longhua Gang Creek and
Puhui Tang Creek. However the water systems in the Pudong area have been modelled using a
stcady state water quality model. The reason for this is that the rivers are oDntrolled to some extent
by tidal gates and other struumes which weaken the tidal influence and the movemt of polluants
in the Pudong area.
Figure 8.1 illustrates the connections between the major rivers and creeks located within the project
area, including the Huangpu River, Longhua Gang. Puhui Tang. Chuanyang Canal, Pudong Canal,
GaoCiao Gang, Caojia Gou, Zhangjia Bang, Beilian Jing. Yangjing Gang and Xigou Gang (eleven
rivers and creeks). The area considered covers 270 km2.
The models are based on the principle of mass conservation. Calibration and verification show that
these two models could be used for the Huangpu River water system with comparatively accurate
results.
8.1.2    Conditions for Simulation
The wastewater curreatly being discharged into the Huangpu River from the SSPII area is mainly
from the Xuhui and Luwan Districts and from the Wujing-Minhang Area in Puxi. The wastewater
collection system for the Wujing-Minhang Area is one of the components of the current Shangbai
Eonment Project which also icluded an                Assessment. Since the wastewater
collected in this area is to be collected by the Pudong Trunk Sewer, the effect of its discharge on the
Changjiang Estary has bce, inmcluded in the evirommental  m et. Therefore, the benefit
resulting fom the waswater interception hould be included m this Envirnmental Assesment.
The quantity of interceped waster from the Wujing-Minhang Area is about 490,000 m3ld

including a high industrial componen. The  mation of its quality is based on the average design
quality of effluent.
8.13 Calclation Procedure
The following two scenarios were considered:
(1)     If the design volume of wastewater is discharged direcdy into the river system instead of
into the proposed sewer system, then, to what extent might the inland water environment be
poUue.
(2)     What will be the environmental water quality of the river system, if the wasewater is
inteepted by the proposed swer system.
By comparing the variation in environmental water quality before and after the sewage is inteepted,
a quantitativ description of the environental benefits of the proposed project is possible.

8.2     Analysb or the Effect on Tnland Watw Quaity
By using dynamic wat  quality idodd for nemtd waterways, an adition  load is int at the 
Section, and the differn water qualities at differe  reaches of the Huangpu River before and after
wastewater interception are given (Tables 8.3 and 8.4). It can be seen that dte most significant
impmvement to the water quality of the Huangpu River is at the Longhua Gang Section (Section '3),
thcre is also a significant improvement at tie water intakes in the Upper Huangpu (the Daqiao Intake
under construction is located in Section nr.l and the existing Linjiang Intake is in Section 2). It is
concluded therefore that the Project has a significant environmental benefit to safiTuarding the
municipal drining water sources.

The negative values in the table indicate the improvement in cnviromnental quality after complction
of the proposed project (i.e. a decrease in pollutant concenrations, excepting DO). The higher the
absolute values, the greater the environntal improvent.
The predictions show that there will be an overall improvement in water quality of the idand water
system after the wastewater are intercepted and discharged wo the sea. The improvement in the
Pudong river system will be much nmre significant than that in Puxi ( the Huangpu Rivrer ). The
main reason is that the proportion of sewage intcepted by the proposed system compared with the
total volume of the Pudong system is larger than that of the Huangpu River. In addition, the
hydrodymic conditions in the Pudoug river system are not as dynamic as those of the Huangpu
River, and the therefore the Pudong system is more sensitive to pollution reduction than the latter.
However Wujing and Minbang areas have an estimated flow of 0.7 midlion m3/day whilst the other
disticts of Puxi have a flow of only 0.4 million m3/day.
The water quality improvmt in the sections downsteam of Longhua (Section Nr.3 ) of the
Huangpu River is more obvious than that of sections in the upper reaches. Water quality
unprovement in the central part of the Pudong river system is more sigmficant than that of otber
water bodies. This is because the hydrodynamic conditions in the centre are poor and pollution is
more serious, therefore the proposed project will be more effective in pollution reduction.
There are important drinkg water sources in the upper Huangpu reaches ( Section Nr.l  and Nr.2).
The proposed project will play a role in improving the water quality of these waters. ChuanYang
Canal is an important drinking water sources for the Pudong New Area. LIkes for water treaument
works are located at Beicai (Section Nr.2), Yaoshi (Section Nr.3) and Chuansha Town (Section NrA).

9      OTHER POTENTIAL DiPACTS OF TIHE PROJECT ON THE NATURAL,
ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMET
Implementation of the Shangai Second Seweage Project (SSPU) will be of great significance in bodt
improving the Huanpu River water quality and speeding up the develpmet of Pudong New Area
( PNA ). However, the scale of the proposed project is large and local natural, ecological and social
enviromenl impacts are unavoidable during project contuction, including permanent and
temporary acquisitibn of farmW , demolition of residential propeties and enteprises, and
iterference in water and land transportation. The potental impacts are described in this section.
Although most of these impacts will eventually disappear with the completion of the project,
mitigation measures which will reduce their impact durmg the construction period are described m
Chapter 11.
9.1    Benelits
9.1.1   Enviromnental Improvement in the Area to be Served by Project
The present inadequate state of the sewerage infrastructure in Shanghai means that a great deal of
uneated wasewatcr is dischwged directly into the Huangpu Rivcr and its tributaries. As a result.
pollution of the surface water m Shanghai has occured, including some areas where the water
enironment is critical. Water pollution has not only affected the normal uses of surface water, such
as industrial or agricultural use, scenic value etc., but also threened the safety of drnking water
sources. The interception and diversion of the sewage would transfer the pollution load away from
the areas where the load is generated and received. Thus, the water environment there could be
expected to improve considerably, thereby encouragmg socio-economic growth.
In the project service area, sewage is discharged at present via pumping stations or directy into the
Huangpu and its tnrbtaries. As a result of population growth and economic development the quantity
of sewage will gradually increase. If o action is taken, the aquatic environment will unavoidably
be degraded.  The impletion of this project could not only curb the deterioration of
environmental quality, but also cut off the current pollution load and enhance the environental
quality in particar.
(1)    As a result of intcepng part of the sewage generAted in the Luwan and Xuhui Districts
in Puxi. in addition to improveving the water environent in these areas, the water quality
of the Huangpu, especily the reaches below Longhua Gang, could be expected to improve.
Because the Huangpu is tida!, its upstream reaches could also benefit to som  exte. The
existing Linjiang water intake and the Daqiao water intake for the Shanghai Enviroment
Project (under constuction) could bc further safeuarded.
(2)    Wujing and Minhang areas are heavily industrialized. Direct discharge of industrial

Appuis Report - Volume 4:&Ervuom_m Amem
wasewat into the Huangpu has been a significant threat to the water quality of the Daqiao
water intake and the existing Linjiang water intake- The proposed SSPH outfalLincludes
wastewater collected from the Wujing and Minhang areas, and the intreeption and diversion
of a part of this wastewater would no doubt result in fiurter direct and obvious water quality
improvements at both of the water intkes.
(3)    The exsting sewerage system in Pudong New Area, especially in the existing urbanised
areas, requeres urgent improvement. An adequate sewerage system is regarded as a pre-
requisite fot development, and as this project includes the future loads from Pudong, it will
provide an important support for sustaiable development of the Pudong New Area.
in addition, in the inland waterways there are several water intakes for local waterworks
(Chuansha Town. Yaoshi, Beicai, etc.). At present. the water quality there is not secure,
and incidents of water quality deterioration occur from time to time. The interception of
sewage discharged into the inland waterways could direcdy contrbute to an improvement
of the water quality at those intakes.
9.1.2   Eairo neal m provementatteOutfall Area
The receiving water body at Bailonggang is able to accept the planned loads without causing an
adverse environmental impact. As soon as the existng southern outfall is deconmissioned by
diverting the flow into the proposed submerged diffuser outfall, the existing black plume along the
coast will be eliminated. Thus, not only will the local aesthetic condition be improved. but also the
maintenance of a migratary passage for fish can be expected.
9.2    Impacts on Natural and Ecological Environment
9.2.1 Impacts on Artificial Vegetation
Ardficial vegetation that might be impacted by the project consumion consists mainly of cultivated
forest and agricLltural crops.
9.2.1.1 Cultivated Forest
During the constuction period, about 10,366 EnZ of rural land will be affected, with 6.980 trees
requiring removal because of sewer constuction. Trees affected include measequoia and elm, and
as well as numerous other varieties of plnted tees aund farmer huses (see Table 9.1). In order
to prevent dmage to the sewer by tree roots, displaced rees will not be replaced in their original
location after the completion of the project, but will be moved to other suitable locations. There may
be some losses during excavation, ansportaion and transplantng and thus would obviously further
decrease the tree cover in the area. Damage to trees on road sides would also result in some
environmental impact in the area

9.2.1.2 Agricaltral Crops
With the development of PNA. an increasing area of fann land has been converted into urban areas
and crop commnunities have reduced. However as this project will be constructed mainly along rivers
and existing or new roads. the imnpact of project construction will not be of great significance.
9.2.2   Inpacts on Natual Vegetation
9.v2.,1 Vegetation in Interfidal Zone
Reeds which grow in the intertidal zone are of high economic value. During project construction,
some reed areas will be damaged, resulting in some economic loss. However on completion of the
project, the reed beds will be replanted. These species have a strong regeneration ability, and will
recover quicldy to their original condition.
In addition, sedge species growing on high intertidal areas will be effected by the project construction.

The main aquatic plants in small rivers and ponds are hornwort. duckweed, water lettuce etc. Wherc
construction interrupts the natural water flow, these fresh water species will be affected.
9.2.3 Impacts on Wildlife
The project area covers mature crop land with a large population, and any indigenous large wild
anials disappaed some time ago. Smaller species existing in the area include mice and yellow
weasels. The project construction will not effect these species.

9.2.4 Impacts on Rivers
The proposed sewer route will cross a number of large and small rivers, including the Sanlingtang,
Xingqiaogang, Beilianjing, Sanbahe, Xigougang, Caojiagou, Pudong Channel, Suitang River and otier
small unnamed rivers. Tnese rivers are tidal, connected to the Huangpu River. MosL are used not
only for transportation but also for agricultural irrigation and dminage. During project construction.
some of these rivers will be cut by embanlments thus stopping the natural flow. The water level in
upstream reaches will rise, while the level downstream will be reduced or even dxy out. At high
spring tides the upstfeam water level could overflow the river banks if proper measures are not taken,
flooding the adjacent low areas and threatening agricultmal land and farmers' properties. In addition,
the retention time of pollutants in the rivers would be extended, possibly resulting in eutrophication
and water quality degradation.
92.5   Impacts on Surface Waters along the Proposed Route
a)     Impacrs on ground run-off during project construction:
During project construction, the land surface along the proposed route of the system will be
disturbed , leading to an increase in dust. In addition, the traffic volume will be greater,
huds increasing the problem. Run-off during severe storms will flush solids into the adjacent
surface waters.
It is generally recognized that a storm, with an intensity of 127 nun/h, could flush away 90
percent of dust and debris. Run-off usually contains various pollutants and nutrient salts,
such as SS, BOD, COD, NH3-N, NO3-N and NOLN.
b.      Impact of pumped water during construction:
As the groundwater table in the construction area is comparatively high, it will be necessary
to pump away impounded water. The effluent wil contain amounts of suspended solids
including soil, sand and cement. This will, if pumped direcdy, increase the suspended solids
in receiving water bodies, accelerating the siltation of water courses. Also, as the pumped
water normally cornains organic impurities, waste oils from machines and other wastes from
construction acivities, it could result in increased amounts of BOD, NH3-N and oils in the
receiving waters, with a consequent decrease in the DO concentration.
9.2.6   Impacts on Groundwater
Phreatic aquifers are well disributed m the construction area, at a dqph of 2 - 5 m, and 3 - 10 m n
thickness. As the proposed sewer conveyor will be laid in the phreatic aquifers, the construction
could effect the phreatic water quality in the project area.
As artesian aquifers are mnainy located at depths of 20 m from ground surface, construction will not

produce any impact on the water flow, quantity and quality of those aquifers.
9.3    Impacts on Social Environment
A separate Resettlement Action Plan will be prepared. Residents, farmers and enterprises will be
compensated for all losses according to Govermment regulations and as specified in Chapter 11 and
the RAP.
9.3.1  Introduction
According to an estimate by the Pe-engineering Department of Shanghai Sewerage Project
Construction Conmany (SSPCC), 158.2 ha ( equivalent to 2,373.6 mu ) of famlland in the rural part
of PNA needs to be acquired for the project. Costs for land acquisition are 200,000 yuan per mu and
the total cost would be 474.72 million yuan.
The following section describes two major characteristics of the area:
Average area of farnland per capita is very small. The main outputs of cultivated land are grain crops
and vegetables. Rice and wheat are grown by rotation, which means that paddy rice is grown in the
penod from May to November and wheat from November to May. The annual yield of the paddy
rice is around 500 kg/mu, and wheat around 300 kg/mu. The mtiple cropping index for vegetables
is about 3.5 with annual yield of about 5,500 kgl/mu.
Following impacts may occur from the acquisition of the fannland:
(1)    Reduction of cultivated area
According to available statistics, there are, along the alignment of the proposed sewerage
systern, seven townships with a cultivated land area of 4,825 ha, of wlich 158.2 ha will be
acquired for the project construction, accountig for 3.3 percent of the total. At present the
average per capita area of cultivated land is only 0.8 - 1.1 nu, thus after land acquisition,
the problem of per capita area of land available will become more serious. In addition, the
acquisition of crop and vegetable lands will cause direct impacts on the existing Shanghai
food and vegetable supply programme and make the supply of vegetable more difficult.
According to the prelimary estimate, the ratio of crop land to vegetable land is about, 1:1.
The acquisition of these lands would reduce the supply of vegetables by 6530 tons
(accounting for 7.6 % of the total production in Pudong area ) and 474.7 tons of grain (
accounting for 3.2% of the total grain production in Pudong area ). Meanwhile, vegetable
farmers may suffer econonuc loss from land acquisition as the annual output of vegetable
land could be 5000 yuan per mu while that of grain land is only 2,800 yuan. In additdon,
after land acquisition, farmers will have to purchase their vegetables in the markets.

(2)     Resettlement
La  acquisition may result in annmers losing thbr production means. However, most of
famers may prefer to leave the land and obtain a new job. In accordance with State policies,
there are three ways to resetde fanners whose lands are acquired for construction projects;
a) Organizations acquiring land are responsible for resettling pero  affected to State
owned enterprises or institutions;
b) Compensation will be given to persons affected by the proposed project. They will then
be responsible for earning a living themselves.
c) A montily pension will be given to females over 45 and males over 55.
Most young people prefer the first option. But the difficulty that may occur in resettlement
is that farmers cannot meet the education requirements set by the working units, or the
farmers are not satisfied with the income in their new working units. In accordance with
policy, frnners will be paid a monthly subsidiary ( for one year ) until a new job is
allocated. Therefore there is no incentive to find a new job. In addition, in the one year
subsidised period, the farmers could obtain tenporary work, which would lead to an
increased income.
More mature people tend to prefer the second option.
Older people ( over sixty ) prefer the third option, as the pension is about 100 yuan higher
( 3 - 6 tnmes higher ) than that which a farmer could nonmally eanL However, retirement
at 45 for females may be too early, because a low education standard and a lack of
professiona! speciality, makes it difficult to find a new job. In addition with the changing
marke-based economy and high consumption in urban areas. they may have somne difficulty
in adapting their daily life.
9.3.2  Impacts from Land Acquision
During the consrcion period, 107.66 ha (1,614.9 mu) of fiumland will be temporarily acquired for
use ( Table 9.2 ). The cost for leasing this land is 140,000 yuan per mu with total cost of 226.09
million yuan. During preparatory stage, this land will be used for accss to the construction sites,
or for strig construction materials. machines and excavated spoil, and for site offices, temporary
3cconmodation etc
During the constuction period, this land will not produce any profiL Also the land will be adversely
impacted when used for project preparation and constuction, and will be difficult to reinstate to its

original level of productivity.
Temporary acquired land will be returned to farmers when construction is comleted. Where land
has been used as access to the construction sites, it is likely to have becn deformed and compacted
by construction traffic. This will reduce its fertility. Land used for storing and processing
construction materials may retain a residual layer of grit and gravel, naking it unsuitable for
cultivation. In addition, if the land has been used for dumping construction waste or domestic waste
from the construction areas, it will be difficult to recover to the level suitable for cultivation.
Unplaned stockpiling of top soil and sub soil may result in miring of soil ypes, causing a
deterioration of soil quality.
Whether or not the conditions of temporary land can be recovered to the original level before being
returned to tne fanners depends mainly on the construction methods and on-site clearance after
completion of project construction.

9.3-3.1     Impacts an Residences and Dwdlin
A total of 734 frm    dwellings will be affected. The buildings are generlly private properties. After
demoltion, the land and funds neceary for rebuilding will be provided for by local government in
accordance with policy. Owners of older houses which need rebabilitation are generally satisfied with
the policy, whilst those with newly built houses would suffer economic loss from the resetlement
policy, because compensation may not cover the actual cost previously spent on rebuilding or
rehabilitating their houses. For farmers, building a house is a major achievement Many fanners put
aside savings for naby years in order to build their own houses. Usually, this requires the saving
of the whole family. In addition, a great deal of physical and mental effort is required, and therefore,
farmers build up a deep attachmet to their own houses. Thus if the effects of project inplementation
are not dealt with properly. a degree of instability in the society may result.
For the 1,864 resident households whosc dwellings will be demolished, the project construction unit
wil arrange new dwellings together with compensation for their related economic losses. However
the resettled residents will suffer temporary inconvenience by moving to a new environment with
unfamiliar neighbours and surroundings. For those with poor living conditions at present, however,
resettement will mean that their living conditions could be improved. This would stimulate their
enthusiasm for botl life and -'ork.
If the residents and farmers are resettled nearby, there will be less difficulty in continuing to work
on their existing land or village-run enterprises, and for their children to continue to study in the
present school. On the other hand if they are moved some distance, they will find it inconvenient
both for work and satdy.
9.33.2 Impacts on Enterprises
A total of 63.500 m& of enterprise-owned buildings would be affected by project construction. Some
of the buildings would be partially dismantled, thus reducing the available floor area. As a result.
there will be some economic loss. For those enterprises whose buildings need to be totally
demolished, normal operation would be disrupted, and some may have the prospect of close-down.
rebuilding or changing their products.
Enterprises would lose incme in the course of demolishing and rebuilding, but will still need to pay
staff wages, thus imposmg serious economic loss. Some enteprises may alrady have made provision
for this as part of their own rehabilitation plas. Job opporunities would be reduced during
demolishing and rebuilding, increasing the nmber of people waitig for jobs. In addition, the
income of staff will be affected to some extent. Al these affects coud becme unstable factors in
the society. On the other hand, demolishing and rebuilding could provide those enterprises with poor
product marketing capability with a good oppotumity to reimnest and readjust their products.

9.3.3.3 Impacts on Agricultural Sheds
This generally refers to greenhouses in the nual area of Shanghai. For vegetable fa-mers. it is more
profitable to gow vegetables in greenhos  than in the natural environment, as the selling price is
much higher. Therefore, demolishing these greehouses would affect fanners income. If project
construction takes place during the sowing season, demolition would have impact on grain production,
thus affecting the food supply of the farmers.
Demolition of electric transformer stations and water storage facilities will also have impact on local
agricultural production.
93.3.4 Impacts on Barns
This generally refers to barns used for P estock, or to store farm tools. seeds, chemical fertilizers or
pesticides.
The suburbs of Shanghai provide the city witi large numbers of pigs and other livestock. Project
construction would result in demolition of some of these bams. The farmers could either sell the
livestock earlier or build temporary sheds. The former would cause economic loss to farmers as the
price for early marketing of livestock would be lower. The latter option might be mor favoured,
reducing the economic loss of project impacts.
933.5 Impacts of Project Consruction on Buildgs
The proposed sewer conveyor will genrally be constructed by excavation, except for the Huangpu
and Chuanyang Canal crossings which will be constructed by jacking techniques. Experience from
the construction of SSPI, shows that inadequate preparation for excavation or jacking could resut in
serious consequences, such as building subsidence or collapse, with the possibility of casualties.
9.3.3.6 ReettIment of Affected Inhabitants
(1)    Procedures for Resetlement
According to the 'Law of Land Use Management of P. R. China" and other related local laws and
regulations concerning land acquisition and rsettlement for urban infrastructure projects, SSPCC will
allocate special funds, and. together with the governments at county and village level. organize proper
resetdement for the affected inhabitants.
Resettlement of residents and famers to new locations is arranged by the county and village
govermnets in accordance wih local development plans. If farmers are required to build houses
themselves at assigned locations, they will be compenated for and subsided directly by te
governm s according to the related laws, regilation and standards. For those whose houses or

Appraisl Report - Voeme 4:Environuema A/esmnt
dwellings are to be rebuilt by the local government, funds for new houses and dweDlings will be paid
to construction contractors instead of the affected residents.
(2)     Location for Resetlement
The principle for resettlem  is that project developers should resetde the affected residents in a more
concentated area in the vicinity, with consideration given to town and village plans. The living
conditions of the residents after resettlement will not be lower than that of before. -
SSPCC has already built a mmber of new model flats with moden facilities in Nanxing, Chuannan,
Wanggang, Zhangjiang, Heqing, areas whicb are used as resettlement base areas. Each area has been
equipped with niddle schools, primary schools. kindergartens and nurseries as well as public transport
facilities.
(3)     Resettlenent of Working Unit Buildings
Enterprises affected by project construction will be resetded to sites in accordance with district and
village planning. The loss of ftxed assets and partal non-fixed assets could be compensated. As the
Pudong area is now being developed and every villagc has its own plans for industrial zones and small
residental areas, there will not be a serious problem in siting enerprises.
(4)     Methods for Dealing with Buildings Affected by Project Construction
There are two ways of dealing with the issues.
a.      If the building can no longer be used, compensation wi be based on its actual cost,
b.      If the building can continue to be used, repair might be provided, with an agreed once-and-
for-all compensation.
93.3.7 Compensation for Demolished Buildins
According to the laws and regulations of Sbanghai relating to land acquisition and resettlement for
construction projects, the compensation level is based on a number of indices such as building
structure, style, category, facility condition, building materials used, floor space, age etc. A scoring
system would be used in determming compensation levels. The compensation budget is not allowed
to be used for any other purpose by individuals or organizations.
9.3.4   Impacts on Existing Vilgs
During project construction, some existing villages will be demolished and some will be relocated
away from neighbouring villages. After resettlement communication between neigthbours will be more
difficult. This will be felt especially by older people, who may feel more cut off.

9.3.5  Impacts on Transportation
'he twenty main roads that the proposed sewer system will cross include Kaixuan Rd, Longhua Rd
(W) , Wanping Rd (S), and Luban Rd in Puxi area, and Yaohua Rd (branch). Jiyang Rd. Yanggao
Rd (S), Hunan Highway, Yusun Highway, Chuanbei Highway, Bengzhan Rd, Shangchuan Highway,
Nanfeng Highway, Jianping Rd. Longdong Rd in Pudong area as well as Sanhang Highway. Sanlu
Highway, Zhouzhou Highway, Pusan Highway which are incuded in the Outer Ring Road Project
( Figure 7.1 ). These are roads with large traffic volumes. The proposed sewer system will either
cut across these roads, or run parallel with them. In addition, some bridges along the route of the
sewer system in Pudong will be demolished. T1hough the roads served by these bridges are not main
roads, they are the main access roads for towns and villages.
During the excavation and pipe-laying stage, there will be traffic congestion along these highways.
The conventional way to solve the problem is to build sidacks for vehicles during construction.
As these temporary roads are usualy very narrow, it is impossible for vehicles to pass each other.
In addition, some vehicles will find it necessary to make a detour, which will not only increase the
mnileage but also increase the traffic volumes on other roads.
During project construction, a number of bridges need to be dismanded. Although temporary bridges
would be provided, traffic congestion is unavoidable. Some vehicles would have to make a detcur
because the temporary bridges are not wide enough.
During project construction, spoi encroaching on the road surface will result in narrowing of the
carriageway. On dry days, the surface will be dusty and on wet days, the roads will be covered with
mud and become slippery. In addition, because of the conditions motor vehicles and pedestrians will
share the same lane and traffic congestion will becomne even more serious.
9.3.5.2 Impact on Field Tracks
Field tracks are the main access for agricultural machinery, vehicles and tools for seeding, harvesting
and transportation.
Some of these tracks will be either cut through or be excavated during project construction. The
solution to the former problem could be the building of a temporary road, but for the latter, it will
be impossible to build another road, thus bringing about significant impacts to agricultural production.
If construction occurs in the sowing season, agriculturl machinery will not be able to gain access to
the fields, If construction is during the harvest the effect will be similar. However, these problems
will be temporary.
93.53 Impact on Waterway Transportation
The proposed sewer conveyor will cross major creeks for example Sanlintang, Xigou Gang. Caojia

Second Shanghai Sewerage Project                                                May 1995
Appral Report - Volume 4:Envivontental Asscimew
Bang, Pudong Canal and Beilian Jing. According to construction regulations, when sewer
construction crosses county/village-grade waterways, embanlanents need to be built each side of the
trench in order to prevent water from entering the construction section. Water is then pumped from
the trench to allow construction in the dry. This construcion approach is suitable for smaller rivers.
However, as river courses have to be closed during construction, boats are required to change their
routes. The timne taken to reopen the water course to traffic depends on the river width, construction
scale and complexity. It usually takes four months, within which water transport will be greatly
affected. If boats ignore the warning notices and enter the affected reach of the river, it might be
difficult to turn because the waterways are usually narrow. Some might even be stranded. At night
unlit construction signs are not obvious, and boats entering the river could easily collide with the
embankment, possibly resulting in the collapse of embankment, casualties and/or damage to boats.
This would seriously affect both water transport and construction progress.
The surrounding area of Shanghai is characterized by a network of rivers and lakes which have
become the main routes for trasporting goods and raw materials from villages and factories to the
city. Interruption of these waterways might result in economic loss to some working units.
9.3.6  Impact on Farm Land
9.3.6.1 Impact on the Soi
a.     If spoil heaps are incorrectly planned, and top soil is allowed to mix with sub-soil, loso of
fertility will result. In addition, careless use and disposal of construction maerals will result
in sand, waste, and cement, containating the land, further reducing fertility, with a
possible permanent loss for cultivation purposes.
b.     The fertility of land could be reduced because organic substances are flushed away by
effluent from the construction sites. This would also lead to loss of crop output.
9.3.6.2 Impacts on Agriculural Irrigation
a.      Water channels for irrigation are the arteries of agricultaual production. At present.
irrigation water pipes in Pudong area are buried. This is beneficial to agricultural irrigation
and farm land nianagement.
During project constructio  some channels might be cut, affecting the irrigation of farm
land dowtream. As paddy fields reqWire large quantities of water, interuption of te
water supply would lead to loss in agricaltural output.
b.      Water for irrigation is extracted from, and drain to rivers. Cutting rivers with construction
embankments would impact the irrigation of farm lands downstream because of insufficient

water, whi land im upstm m areas would suffer from poor drainage because of the higher
water level. This would affec the agnicltural output and reduce the fanners' income.
93.7   hnpact on Electric Power and ammunication  nins
Most power lines in PNA are buried. Many villag!s have been connected to the telephone system.
These power and communication links, together with water supply mains, and the China-Japanese
communication and photocable system might be affected by the proposed construction if proper
measures are not taken. Intenruption of commuication or dectric power supply, would result in a
serious impact.
9.3.8  Impact on Cultural Rdics, Historic Sites and Graves
According to the on-site survey, there are no cultural relics, historic sites and ancient or famous trees
along the route of the sewer system. However, there are many graves, which need to be relocated
before construction. Liaison and contact procedures need to be put in hand otherwise serious delays
to construction progress may ensue.
9.3.9   Inpact of Windborne Dust and Noise
9.3.9.1 Impact of Wmadborne Dust
During construction, if excavated spoil is stockpiled for several weeks or months, the spoil will be
dried by exposure to sunlight and vind, and when disurbed will raise dust clouds resulting in an
increase in the fine particulate content of the ambient air. This wiU have a serious effect on the cily
and surrounding landscape. Nearby buildings and vegetation would be covered with a layer of dust,
houses in the vicinity would suffer. Rain or snow would result in construction sites becoming muddy.
9.3-92 Impact of Noise
The main source of noise wiUl be the operation of constuction machines and vehicles transporting
building materials during the construction of conveyors and pumping stations- At night, especially.
construction noise would impose a serious impact on the residents in the vicinity, interfering with
their work and rest. If night working was fiobidden or strictly controUed, the imct of noise on the
surrounding Tesidents would be mininized.
9.3.10 Impact of Cwstruction and Domestic Wastes
During project consauction. a large number of buildings will be demolished. Some reusable material
from the demolished buildings will be taken away by the owner of the property or those demolishing
the buildings. However wse material that cannot be reused is geneally discarded, possibly affecting
the surrounding envirounmet, by being used to fill rivers aux. ponds, thus affecting the flow and watcr

quality of these waters.
Each construction site will have about ten thousand workers and staff members accommodated with
lodging and on-site catering. Therefore, it is very important to have proper facilities for water and
power supply as well as waste collection, otherwise unsanitary conditions in the construction sites may
affect the health of the workers. In particular, wastes dumped in summner will cause fly nuisance with
the possibility of epidemic disease. In addition, the population in the surrounding areas would also
suffer from mosquitos, flies, offensive odour and diseases.
9.3.11 Impact on Water Supply Sources
Tne results of on-site surveys showed that inhabitants living in the areas along the proposed system
use tap water. Most water supplies come from deep wells, several hundred metres iri depth. Only
in a few areas is surface water used as a source of water supply. For example, the waterworks in
the township of Chuansha takes water fiom the Chuanyang Canal. In the suburbs, because of
insufficient power supply, there are occasional power interruptions. In these cases or in summer
when the waterworks cannot meet the peak demand, inhabitants in the affected areas use water from
shallow wells 5 - 10 m in depth. It was iound that inhabitants living in the areas along the system
also occasionally use surface water from rivcrs, but mostly for cleaning purposes.
Those using deep well water are unlikely to be affected during construction, whilst those using surface
water irectly from rivers or shallow wells could be subject to undesirable effects of project
construction.
9.3.12 Impact of Spoil
During project construction, it is expected that 1.277 million nm of excavated spoil will be generated.
During transportation and disposal of this spoil, there could be impacts on the local environment.
Spoil dropped on the ground by overloaded vehicles, and spoil on the vehicle wheels would generate
dust clouds on fine days. and would make fth road mddy on wet days, affecting both people and
passing vehicles as well as the local environment.
If the spoil is not properly stockpiled or disposed of, it would affect the use of land, flow in rivers,
damage the natural and ecological envinmen and unpact the cleanliness of the city.
Transportation of spoil needs a large number of vehicles. During the day, this would affect traffic
in thie Pudong area and result in traffic congestions.

Appraissl Repon - Volume 4:Envimnmenial Assessment
9.4     Pulaic Participation
In order to assess dbe public's concerns, opinions and requirements on the SSP n project, an
investigation and public survey has been carried out in areas afferted by construction.
9A.1   Method
There are several ways in which public opinion can be assessed, for example, symposia, advisory
meetings. visits and-tuestionnaires. The object is to let people who will be affected by the project
state their views and the opinions.-and to find out the general status of the person and his family. The
results of the assessment and survey were collected and sunwrsed and the results are given below.
The questionnaire is shown in Table 9A.
9.4.2   Investigation Scope
Seven townships in Pudong section will be affected by the works. Five of these were investigated.
consituting 71 % of the townships involved.
-      Sanlin Township in Pudong New Area;
e      Hengmian Township in Nanhui County;
*      Beicai Town;
e      Wanggang Township and Heqing Township;
e      three different types of enterprise; one state-owned, one Sino-foreign joint venture and one
township enterprise.
9.43   People Investigated
Cadrs fiom local goverment, administration personnel for land planning in villages and towns.
cadres from villages and production brigades, farmes, resetler representatives. staff of enterprises
and resettler families.
9.4.4   Invesigation Result
The result of the investigation is summarised in Table 9.5.
From the investigation, it can be seen that the industry and agriclture in Pudong New Area to be
affected by the project are flourishing, particularly the enterprises run by towns, villages and
brigades. Tap water is the main drinking water source for farmers. The major part of the family's
income is from both industry and agriculture. The living standard is fairly high with an amnal income
for each person of about 10,000 yuan.

App-iaal Repont - Volume 4:EnvironmerAl A_tseame-
Considering the importance of the impact on residences, cultivated land and working units caused by
land acquisition and land borrowing, the major impact is on residences and cultivated land,followed
by working unit and family plot.
The question which most concerned the public is the resetlement of residences, compensation policy,
land acquisition for enterprises and impact on farm facilities. It is required that the relevant
deparument should give early notice of the start date and the construction progranmme. The local plan
should be guaranteed by law and should give sufficient consideration to local interests.
9.4.5   Summary of Public Opinion
Support for Project Construction
The township governments, village and brigade organisations, relevant working units and
the public are in favour of and support the SSP 11 project in general. They reported that they
would cooperate with the project developer. The project developer should respond by
maintaining close contact and consultation with the local goverunent.
Policy
The project developer should solicit opinions from  local authorities before the
imprlementationof the policy and programme of land acquisition and resettlement. Inforning
the public of the policy, will bring benefits to the project programme.
*      Land Acquisition and Borrowing Programme
The project developer should consult with the local authorities the question of land

Appraisal Report - Volumec 4:EnvironmenIa Assessmtn
In Order to reduce the downtime and reduce the loss as much as possible, re-acquisition of
land for relocating enterprises should be carried out in advance. Thus enterprises can be
moved into new buildings when the the new buildings arl comp)leted.
Compensation
According to policy, compensation for collective and personal properties should be
reasonable and equitable.
*       Allocation of Labour Force
-    Where allocatjon of the labour force is difficult in areas with large land acquisitions,
the State should take responsibility.
-    It would be appropriate if young people with technological or other special skills took
upon themiselves the responsibility for finding jobs.
*   Re-acquisition for Land
The need for reacquisition of land must be considered so as to avoid a second resettlement.
*   Planning
-    Vr - -Ian should be guaranteed by law. The existing plans prepared by local townships
a:    g -ges will also be affected by this project to-a cermain extent.
-    This project should be construced simultaneously with the planned extension of
Longdong Road and the Outer Ring Road.
Construction
- Construcion should be well planned and should proceed by sectons. Construction
should start and finish as early as possible.
-    The ommenementdate and programme of constucton should be notified to local
governments and affected residents in advance so as to give themn reasnable time to
make necessary arrangements.
- During construction, the possi-ble impacts caused by spoil and drainage should be
treated properly. In general, adequate protecton must be provided to the environment
and all existing facilities.
- Local water supplies, power supplies, c mmuications and broadcasing lines,
irrigation channels, roads, underground facltines and naviortion courses should be
diverted or renovated promptly.

10           RISK ASSESSMENT
10.1         Risk Inpact Assessment for Changliang Esty
The Bailonggang outfall is a large sructure and has a long design life. Once constructed and put
into operation, it will be difficult to rebuild or to undetake major renovations. Therefore, an
asssment of the environmental risks associated with the stmcture should be carried out.
10.1.1       Possible Earthquake Impact on the Outfall
According to smistical data over the past hundred years, the possibility of an earthquake of more
than magnitude 7 on the Richter scale in the Shanghai area is extremely small. If it is earthquakes
in the area the nagnitude is usually below 6 on the Richer scale. If a major earthquake does
occur, it will cause serious damage and result in significant pollution if the wastwater overflows
on to the Bailonggang beach. The project is being designed to resist scale 7 earthquakes, thus
there is only a small risk of harmful environmental impact because of earthquakes.
10.1.2       Damage by Ships
The diffuser section of the outfall is not located in the main shipping channel, but on the sideslope
nearest the shore line. The risers protude above the bed of the estuary to a level of about 6-7 m
beneath the water surfice. Under normal conditions, a 10.000 Tonne ship with a draught of about
6 m is unlikely to drift from the main channel and therefore, te risk of damage to the outfall
sucture is small. Small ships which navigate on both sides of the channel generally have a
draught of less than 2 m, and therefore would normally pass over the structures. The main risk is
associated with exceptional weather conditions such as, typhoons, tropical storms, fog or with
accidents such as anchoring becase of mechanical failure. However, the systemn design includes
multi-risers and multi-ports. so in the event of damage only a part of the system would be
affected. Nevertheless, it is essential to provide an adequate warning system round the location of
the outfall to further reduce the risk of damage from ships.
10.13        Ennvironmea Impact Caused by Emergency Disharge
Once the main outfall is constucted and commissioned, its operation could be disrupted by
electrical or mechanical failures in the pumpstaion or header tank. In that case wastewater could
only be discharged from the emergency outfall. The emergency outfall is located at the -2m
isobath, seeral hundreds metres from the shore, so even in the even. of an emergency discharge,
the ecological envinment would still be protected because there is a passage for fish. The
emergecy outfall should also be provided with a warning system to prevent damage from ships.

Appraisal Report - Volume 4:1nvirofincrat Asscssmet
10.1.4       Risk caused by Scouring or Siltation
The riverbed at the proposed site is relatively stable, however scouring or siltation does occur.
The operation of the outfall could be threatened by either a severe scour effect. or a major
siltation event. From a consideration of historical data, riverbed scouring and siltation in the area
of the proposed outfall can result in level changes of over I m. When this is taken into
consideration during the design, it is unlikely to cause any serious concern.
10.2    Risk Impact Assessment for Inland Waterways
As the project will be designed for an earthquake of magnitude 7, the risk of damage lo the
sewage collection system caused by earthquakes is extremelv small. But. in the event of a strong
earthquake, consequential damage to the sewage collection system may be caused by. for example.
facility damage or electricity failure. If as a result wastewater flows into nearby rivers.
environmentally sensitive objectives such as potable water intak-es could be affected. Table 10.1
shows the impact on water intakes caused by estimated concentrations of several parameters.

cause serious harm to maintenance workers' health and possibly endanger their lives.
If the sewage pipes are damaged, leakage and overflow could occur. If the screens in the
pumping stations become blocked, wastewater collection and discharge will be affected. Problems
such as these must be rectified inmmediately, and naintenance workers are required to enter the
pipe or structures. The risk of gas poisoning as a result of H2S inhalation is serious and fatalities
are possible.
According to statistical dat from Shanghai Sewerage Company, there have been many cases
where maintenance workers have experienced dizziness, breathing difficulties, and have even died
because of poor ventilation in sewage pipes and inhalation of poison gas.
The Shanghai Sewerage Company has taken the following measures to protect maintenance
workers entering sewers or pumping stations:
-       Complete an access record form before entering hazardous areas. Provide safety
education;
-       Appoint someone to be responsible for monitoring H,S. Ensure an ambulance is available
at the site;
*       Use a gas miask, and return to ground level at the first sign of distress;
m       }Downwater device to be used for major repairs;
*       Increase subsistence expenses so as to build up the workers' health;
3       Regularly monitor the gas in sewage pipes in order to conduct studies and research into
technical measures for maintaining the sewerage systemn.
In general, the maintenance risk of the SSP[I project is no greater than other similar projects.
With the advancement of scientific technology and the improvement of prevention measures, it is
predicted that serious casualties will be greatly reduced, although minor accidents are unavoidable.
If the management of SSPII can be optimised and monitored, and safety education strengthened.
the rate of accidents can be reduced to a minimum.

11           MITIGATION MEASURES FOR ENVIRONMET IMPACTS
11.1         Objectives
Contuction of the Shanghai Sewerage Project Stage 11 ( SSP H ) will be of grea importance in
improving the water enviromnent of the Huangpu Riwr, protecting the water quality of the upper
Huangpu water supply intake and speeding up the development of Pudong New Area. However,
because of the length of the proposed sewer system which, passes through a number of districts,
counties and villages, adverse impacts on local social, natural and ecological environment caused by
the construction are unavoidable. In order to miimie these envionmental impacts from both project
constuction and later operation, various mitigation measures will be taken. At the same time, as a
considerable length of the proposed sewer will be buried along the planned Outer Ring Road, the
proposed sewer system could be constucted together with the construcion of the Ring Road, which
might reduce the adverse impacts of the two projects.
11.2         Mitigation Measures for Socal Impact from Farm Land Acqsition
11.7-1       Rational Resettlement of Labour Force
For some people, land acquisition for project construction will provide an opportunity of finding a
new job. However for the lderly, it will result in retrement.
For fanners whose job will be affected by land acquisition, appropriate job reallocation wiD be made
by the project developer ( SSPCC ) together with local goverunent in accordance with the State
policies and regulations. For young people with a low eduction level, training and education
programs will be implemented to improved their knowledge and professional skldls so that they can
adapt to new jobs.
Although those at retirement age ( 45 for females and 55 for males) will be retired, local govermment
will still mintain an intest in their welfare, perhaps providing some work in tertiary industry for
those who want it. In addition, the consruction and later operation of the sewer project will provide
some job opporunities for iocal people.
11.2.2       Compensation for Land Leas
During the construction, land might be leased from the farmers to build temporary sheds for storage
of building materials etc. This land will lose its agri-roduction funcion during project construction,
and therefore SSPCC will, together with local government, compensate the farmers for economic loss
in accordance with the relevant pmvisions of laws and regulations. In addition, SSPCC should
produce a cropping plan for the leased land in order to avoid or reduce the land-idle period and
maintain productivity as high as possible, thus reducing the adverse impacts.

11.3         Mitgation Measumes for Project Impact oa Buildings
11.3.1       Compensation and Resetteent
In order to reduce the cost of house demolition and removal, the project design institutes have
conducted a number of on-site visits, to identify an opfimum route to minimize the nmuber of bouses
to be removed. In addition, trenching piles and jacking techniques will be used so that the number
of buildings and houses to be removed is reduced. SSPCC should work together with vilage
management committees to prepare a detailed working schedule, allocate economic compensation
amongst the affected farmers based on State policies and regulations, and find suitable lid to build
new houses or compensate the householders with houses equivalent to or better than their original
one.
11.3.2       Building New Structures for Affected Enterprises
During construction, the premises of some enterprises will be totaUy demolished. In order to reduce,
to the lowest extent possible, the economic loss of pmject-affected enterprises, it is necessary for
SSPCC working together with concrned organisations, to prqmare a detailed working schedule,
compea the affected enterprises for project-related economic loss, help them to find new addresses
and arrange labour forces in accordance with State and local policies and regulations. Most of the
facties affected by project consrucion are owned by vilages. They are usually smal with poor
worling premises and outdated equipment and cannot adapt to continuous economic development.
Therefore, economc compensation and favourable policies for project resettlement will provide a
good opportity for snall industries to rebuild workshops or change products. Most enterprises are
satisfied with these arrangements.
1133         Mnimizing Constuction hIpact on Build
For areas with a high building density or where jacking techniques will be used in constuction, it will
be necessary to obtain a horQugh lmowledge of both ground and underground geo-conditions and to
conduct careful surveys and estmates m order to avoid casualties cased by house collapse or pipe
breaks during construction.
114          Mitgation Measures for Traffic Impact
11.4.1       Route Selection
For the purpose of reducing traffic impact to a minmm  level, several options for sewer routes have
been compared by the relevant institute. One element in the selection process has been to locate a
route with minimum traffic impact so dth the construction cost and social impact can be reduced.

Apprisal Repon - Vdumc 4:Envirmnmueal Aseumnt
11.4.2      Building Temporary Bndges
During construction, some roads will be affected and some bridges dismundled. This will undoubtedly
have serious local affects. SSPCC should take this into consideration when prepanconstrction
implementation plans. For roads with heavy volumes of traffic, temporary roads need to be built
during project construction. In addition, tie construction should be phased and excavation, pipe
laying and trench refilling should be completed as quicldy as -possible. For very busy roads,
construction at peak hours should be avoided ( consuction at night could reduce the traffic impact
during the day). -
Temporary bridges should be provided where existing bridges need to be demolished.
For field tracks, paved bypasses need to be provided so that local transportaton is not affected.
Surplus excavated soil should be carted away. Spoil spills on roads under construction should be kept
to a minimum in order not to affect local traffic.
11.43       Notice and Signs for River Sections under Constmction
For the purpose of not affecting iuland navigation, the contractor should, before construction, be
advised by inland navigation authority to wut up notices at relevant crossing points of the rivers to
direct the navigation. At night, the wamning signials should be set up so that boats are not going in
wrong direction or running into each other.
11.5         Miigation Measures for Impact on Farmland
11.5.1      Strict Control of Effluent Drainage
Effluent from construction sites is not allowed to be discharged onto farmland. Project contractors
should be familiar with lucd geological conditions and locate suitable points at which to drain
effluent, in order that soil fertility and the normal growth of crops is not affected.
11.5.2       Recovery of Borrowed Farm Land
SSPCC should require construction contsactors to consider ways of mmmnising the adverse impac
on farm land borrowed for project construction so that land can be put back into production quicldy.
For example, the top soil and sub soil should be excavated, stockpiled and renstated separately, and
the land should be profiled to the original level. Building materials should be fenced and the land
should be cleaned after construction. Villages affected should work with the construction units to
reinstate the kand.
During project construction, out-of-work labours could be organized to collect organic fertilizers

to spread on the land used for project construction (when retumed). Experience shows that using the
method, farmers could continue to obtain a good harvest from the reunrned land.
11.5.3       Temporary Channels for Water Inigation and Drasng
SSPCC should be fully aware of the importance of water channels for agricultural production.
Temporary measures should be taken during pmject constuction so that the interruption of irrigation
is kept as short as possible.
11.5.4       Building New or Temporay Irrigation Pumpng Stations
Where pumping stations need to be demolished during project construction, consideration should be
given to building new or temporary facilities in order to maintain the operation of the irrigation
system.
For areas which would be difficult to irrigate because of temporary dams built across rivers, the
design instittes and construction units should consider options for pumping water from other sources
in the area in order to maintain the irrigation system.
11.6         Mitigaton Measures for Impact on Water Environent
As the proposed sewer route passes across a number of rivers and creeks, construction will affect
these water bodies. In addition, effluent from excavations would also impact on both underground
and surface waters.
11.6.1       Sedimentaton Tanks for RIedudg Sand from  Costrtion Effluent
Most of the rivers and creeks aie used for drainage and irrigation. Some however are also used for
fishing and transportation, and some are preseved as habitats for wild plants and animals. During
excavation of channels, effluent frm construction sites might be discharged through pumps to nearby
rivers. As the effluent may contain large quanities of slurry and suspended solids the tubidity of
rivers and creeks receiving constrtiction effluent would increase. In order to reduce this impact,
SSPCC should require consuction contractors to build sedimentation tanks at consruction sites so
that effluent is clarified before dscharge into water bodies. This measure would greatly reduce the
impact of slurry and suspended solids on water quality.
11.6.2       Readjustiug Water Levd and Preventing River Flooding
For river crossings temporary dams will be built each side of the sewer trench and pumped from the
trench secion. In dtese cases, water levels in adjacent sections of the river might increase so as to
affact villages and *um land in the vicinity. Therefore, before constuction begins, it will be
neoessary to obtain a dlear understanding of the hydrology of dte area

AppRisal Report - Valume 4:Enviromnental Assessmem
11.7         Mitigation Measures for Impat on Vegetation
It will be important to strictly control the number of trees to be felled and to limit the area of
agricultural land to be affected.
For landscaped areas, trecs and grass should be planted on both sides of the sewer route after the
completion of construction. This will not only recover the original landscaping, but also increase the
area of vegetation.
Natural vegetation will gradually recover after completion of the project and the return to operation
of the rivers and creeks.
11.8         Mitgation Measures for Impact on Electric Power Supply and Commuications
etc.
In the Sanling Township area, the proposed sewer route could affect water supply pipelines, the
China-Japan Communications Photocable, high tension wires, telephone lines, radio lines etc.. Any
damage to these facilities would result in a wide range of effects. Therefore, SSPCC should conduct,
together with the relevant design institutes, detailed surveys to obtain a clear undestanding of their
location and endeavour to keep the proposed sewer route away fromn these underground facilities. If
it is impossible to avoid them, SSPCC should contact the organizations to decide appropriate measures
to avoid or reduce any impact.
11.9         Measures for Cutural Rdics, Historic Sites and Graves
11.9.1       Timely Reporting of Findings to Departmet Concerned
No cultural relics and historic sites have been found along the proposed sewer route. However, if any
such cultural relics or historic sites are located during project consruction, construction workers
should stop working and report their findings to the cultural relic protection deparmment so that on-site
surveys can be undertaken to decide whether or not the construction can proceed. Project contractors
should organize necessary training in this aspect before the project construction begins.
11.9.2       Respecting Lal Customs
Existing graves that need to be moved from the construction area, should be dealt with by the
construction conmany in accordance with local customs. The construction company should request
grave owners to remove the graves by a cerain date. According to local custom, moving graves is
a grave matter which should be carried out on a particular date such as Qimning ( pure brightness ).
Construction companies should progranme their constcton schedules and inform local people as
early as possible in order to properly deal with this sensitive issue.

In order to reduce the impact of the dust on the surrounding environent, it is proposed to sprinkle
water on the surface of stockpiles to prevent dust affecting the environment on dry or windy days.
Construction contractors should remove spoil in accordance with a spoil tlreatment plan. To prevent
spillage, trucks should not be overloaded. When vehides leave construction sites wheels should be
cleaned to remove mud. In addition, a system for keeping site accesses clean should be implemented
on eacb construction site. Roads should be swept regularly.
11.11        Constrution Noise Control
Excavalion, tranWortation, motors and concrete-ixing machines are the main sources of noise on
construction sites. In order to reduce the impacts of construction noise on adjacent residents and in
accordance with local regulanons for stationary noise source control and nmagnagmnt, construction
sites located within 200 m of residences are not allowed to operate during the period from 11 pm to
6 am next morning. In addition, it is recommended that equipment with low noise outputs is used.
If it is necessary for construction sites to work at night, causing a noise impact on local residents, it
is required that noise-reducing measures are taken, including sound barriers around the construction
site or around densely populated areas, so that reasonable noise levels are maintined.
11.12        Disposal of Wstes fraon Constrcion Sites
Project construction requires tens of thousands of construction workers, depending on the degree of
mechanization of the construction contractors. Several construction sites will be required along the
sewer at one time. During sewer construction, conractors will provide their workers and staff
members with temporary on-site offices, accommodation and dining rooms. Therefore, SSPCC and
the contractors should contact the local sanitation departments to make arrangements to clean and
carry away domestic wastes from the construction sites regularly. The contractors should educate
staff not to deposit waste on the construction site in order to keep a clean working and living
enviromnent.
11.13        Water Supply for Project-affected Residefts
In some areas, the sewer might be buried to a depth lower than the water level in adjacent wells, or
the water level in the wells might reduce becahe of dewatering of the construction site. In addition,
effluent pumnpxd frm the construction sites might affect the water quality of wells and rivers in the
vicinity. Ail these would affect water supplies from wells and rivers.
Theaeore, SSPCC should be prepared to supply water. Ways of overcoming the problem include
a) using tankers to carry water, or b) temporarily exending he local water supply system.

11.14        Prepag Plans for Transpti  and Disposig of Spoil and COstuction
Wastes
SSPCC has, togedher with die waste managemcnt authorties in Shanghai and Pudong New Area,
prepared a plan for the disposal of 1.277 million n3 of constuction spoil. Spoil will be used to build
the Outer Ring Road. level the land at Zhangjiang i-techl Development Area, and fill the Changjiang
cnbankment. Contractors should contact local transportation deparments to prepare spoil and
construction waste transportation pans. Transportation at peak hours should be avoided. Spoil and
wastes should be transported along specified routes and disposed of at designated sites. Random
inspections should be carried out to ensure that the plans are implemented properly. If during
construction, toxic or hazardous wastes are found, the construction company should stop construction
and contact the local environment and health department. Construction should not be continued until
necesary measures have been taken. For the demolition of toxic and hazardous structures, both the
local environment and health departments must be contacted in order that they may take the necessary
measures.
11.15        Enhancement of Sewage Dispersion
11.15.1      Layout of Diffuse System at Sewage Outfall
Since the residual current at Bailonggang has a shearing interface at
-5 m bathometric contour along the coasdine, it is commnded that the diffuser section of the outfall
is laid beyond the -5 m contour. Thus, the sewage can be prevented frm  retuning to tde coastal
shoal and can be flushed away seaward.
The current vector rose at Bailonggang shows the prevailing bearings in the flood season are 1200
- 1500 (ebb tide) and 300 - 330 (flood tide) whilst in the drought season they are 145 - 1650 (ebb
tide) and 3150 - 345 (flood tide). Through statistical analysis, the most dominant bearings of the
residual current are 1450 and 3250. formiing an angle of about 100 with the shoreline (135 -3150).
If the axial tread of the diffuser section is set as 550 (i.e., rotaDtg clockwise 10 frm the
perpendiculr to the shoreline), the river flow involved in sewage dilution is inceased by about
1.54% over that if the diffuser section is set perpendicularly to the shoreline.
11.15.2 Orientation of Sewage Outfall Diffuse Ports
A series of risers is proposed at the diffuser section of the sewage outfa1 with multiple ports on each
riser. The port orientation affects the initial jet, thereby affecting the initial dilution and dispersion
process of the sewage into the mbiet water body. The Changiiang estuary has an extremely low
salinity, the density difference with the sewage is small, and the water depth at Bailonggang is
relatively shallow, therefore in order to optinise the rising momentun of the sewage discharged into
the water body so that it is neither too fast and risks touching the surface, nor too slow and risks
touching the river bed causing an aggregation of pollunts, it is recommeded from a preliminary

analysis that the ports are eevated at an angle. of about 15.
11.153 Warnig Sigs aground the Sewage Outfall
Although the diffusers are located at about 50 m from the main channel, the possibility still exists of
damage by ship anchors or fouling by fishing nets. Warning signs should be located around the
diffusers alerting ships and vessels to the hazard in order to reduce the occurrene of accidents.
11.15.4 Impact Cdntrol of Emegency Outfall
Under normal conditions, use of the emergency outfal is not allowed. It can orny be used in case of
emergency. In order to reduce the possibility of its use, maintenance procedures need to be set up
to keep all facilities in good condition so that operation of the deep water diffuser system is
mainmined.
The emergency outfall is located beyond the -2 m bathometric contour, therefore adverse
environmental impacts from discharge of sewage at the -2 m contour will be reduced.
11.15.5 Threat of Riverbed ScOur and Siltation to Diffuser Safety
Riverbed scour and siltation might damage or inundate the diffusers, interrupting normal operation
of the system. Therefore, methods of dealing with scour and siltation should be considered when
designing the system. In additon, monitoring of river bed scour and siltation should be strengthened
so that responsive coutenneasures could be taken to ensure the safety of the diffuser system.
11.16   Migaton Measures for Sludge Disposal
11.16.1 Heavy Metal Control
Heavy metals shall be removed from the waste water at the source and not at a general treatment
plant. SSC and other agencies authorised by SMG will work out and enforce standards for effluent
discharge from industries. The industries will have to establish separate tream   plants to comply
with these requirements.
Control of the industrial waste watcr will be important to ensure dtat:
The discharge of Cetegoty I pollutants at Bailonggang comply with the National Discharge
Standard
The concentration of heavy metals in sludge from a fiture treatment plant at Bailonggang
is acceptable also for agricultural application.

11.16.2 Rcovery and Utilisation of Methane
The proposed landfill for sludge will have a tp drainage layer and ventiation outlet for methane and
other gases from anaerobic digestion. It is possible to recover and utilise the energy potential in
nmetane, but it will not be cost efficient for a sludge landfill of 4-6 m filling height. It is proposed
to flare the gas to reduce the odour and the emission of greenhouse gas.
11.16.3 Prevention of Beach Pollution by Leachate from the Landl Sites
Spoil, excess soil from the excavation of the conveyors and other construction works. will be used
to fill the bottom layer of the landfill to a level above the ground water level. The bottom layer wiDl
be day or other materials with very low permeability. The leachate will be collected in drainage
trenches with pipelines, pumped to the inlet of the tratment plant and discharged through the
submerged sewage outfall.

Also plans will be made for cropping the land during the period from the date of land borrowing to
the final date for retrning back the land.
:12.13.2     Construction Project Tendering and Contract Signg
Requirments for civil construction will be prepared by SSPCC during the tendering process. In
addition, the physical or non-physical measures proposed by construction contractors will be
reviewed. In order to avoid or limit adverse environment impact, regulations and measures to be
followed and enforced by the construction contractors should be included in the contract docaums
signed between SSPCC and the construction contractors.
12.1A        Management of Project Construcion
During project contuction, SSPCC will not only be responsible for the maagement of construction
quality and progress, but wil also ensure that meaures both for civil construction and enviroment
unpact mitgation are properly implemented, and will supemvise the implementaion of proisioos in
the contract documents.
12.lA.1      Eginemerig Supervision and  Yg t
During project construction, SSPCC should procue independent supervision and mget
engies. These engineers wil also supervise and manage the implementtion of the environmental
protection measures, particularly ensuring that the complementnry egineering projects (e.g. link
sewers and rdated fiiifies) progress according to schedule, engineering quality meets the design
standards and that the project as a whole produces environmental benefits.
12.1.4.2     Supevising the  lion of  nvmenta Impact Mitigation Measues
SSPCC has responsibility for implementing the enviromental impact mitigation measumes in order
to mWmise environmental impacts, and to set out the requiements for construction contractors to
implement the relevant measures. Local governments (e.g. districts, counties, neighbourhood
commite, townships) with responsibility for envirommental protection, envionmental sanitation
administration, landscaping, traffic, urban construction  ion, water comervancy etc. will
supervise the following aspects of the projecL

*    Spoil disposal: spoil excavated should be stockpiled,  ansported and disposed of
strictly in accordance with plans, and the top soil from agricultural land should be
sockpiled separately from sub-soil.
*    Drainage: effluent from the construction sites should be setded and suspended solids
removed before being discharged into water bodies or the urban sewer system.
*    Construction noise: noise from the construction sites should be strictly controlled in
accordance with relevant laws and regulations so that the environmental impact is
reduced.
*    Domestic wastes: proper treatment should be carried out iD accordance with relevant
regulations and standards.
Construction completion: top soil from agricultual land should be replaced and rivers
where temporary dams were built for constrion purposes should be returned to their
original state.
12.1.4.3     Surface Water Mauitoring
Monitoring wil be mainained during the project construction on the basis of Shanghai Surface Water
Monitoring Program. Data obtained at locations within the project area ( including dte tidal areas)
will be used as the environmental background value before cousution.
The Changjiang estuary at Bailonggang will be the receiving point for wastwater intercepted by the
proposed system. The environment quality of dtese waters is of great concern. In considering the
near-field and far-field impacts, these waters should be included in the monitoring programme. This
rmeuirm t should be icluded in the Changjiang Estuay Surface Water Monitoring Program. A
biological survey capable of indicating the environmental quality is also rquired to be included n
the Changiang estuary Surface Water Monitory Programe. the basic requirement is the investigation
of biomass, diversities, toxicants accumulated in tisses of inertidal benthos. The monitoring
frequency proposed is 3 times a year at least, to represent the flood average and drought season
respectively, although 4 times a year to represent four seasons would be better.
Table 12.1 shows details of the requirem    for surface watr monitoring in different riverslareas.
12.1.4.4      Monitoring of Sewer System
The purpose of monitoring the sewage in the system during project construction is to assess whether
the effluent can meet the future sewage standards and to carry out preparatory work for system

12.221       Mangement of the Conveyac and Treatnent Systems
The combined sewerage system consists of coDection, conveyance (sewers, pumpig stations),
utament plant, outfall, etc. As regards the system itself, the current responsible depatmen  is the
Shanghai Sewerage Company (SSC) under the jurisdictio of the Shanghai Municipal Engining
Administration BureuL SSC is responsible for the operaion and maintenance of link sewer as well
as tunk sewers, pumping stations, treatment plant and outfall facilities (Fig. 12-1). Its responsibLities
are defines as:
*      Inspecting, momtorng and managing discarges mto the system;
*      Controlling and efficiently opeating the system;
*      Maining dte sy& m to ensure its normal operAion;
*      Implementing the collection of drainage taiffs to recover the capital mvesm    and 0 & M
cost of the system;
For Shanghai it is appropriate that SSC manages the SSPI conveyance and tatmen  systm, whilst
its associated monong station is responsible for monitorng the sewage in the system.

AFPinmiW Rcpoz - Volme 4&Ea nl Aessment
In addtionto the relevant indusal bureaux under the jurisdictionof Shanghai Economic Cormission
and the local govenment deamen  responsile for industry. dte. responsible agencies for
management of industrial wastwater are the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Ewionmental Protection
(SEPB) (via Water Quality Management Dqeprmnt) and the local environmental protection burcax
(LEPBs) (via poliution management divisions). The environmental protection bureaux in the two-tier
government system are also responsible for trade wastewater managenant and re!evant agencies
supervsing the tade sectors also have responsibilitics.
The objective of managing industrial and trade was_er by the environmental protection burcaux
in the two-tier goverment is to control pollutants potentially harmful to the envioment. Category
I pollUtants specified in the wastewater standard (GB8978-88) should be oGntroDed at source by
specifying maxinm allowable concentration lin*mi. For the Category H pollutants. the control
should be on the basis of total limiting loads. The environmental protection agencies impose pollution
control on individual enteprises based on the control target Monitoring resuts (either under normal
or abnormal conditions) carried out by the Shanghai Enviromnental Montoring Centre (SEMC) under
SEPB and local environental monitorng staton under resetv LEPBs provide the basis for the
contol.
However, the agency responsible for managin the conveyance ad treaent system of sewage is
concerned about controlli m ials or variables that may potentially bring harm to the sewers,
pumps, or teatment process. A monitoring station under SSC is responsible for inspectioning the
indusial and trade cffluent, and for issucing permits.
Therefore, the management of the sewerage system users depends on a combination of above two
aspects.
Based on the Water Pollution Prevention Act of the PRC and "Provisional Rule on Colection of
Emission FeeW issued by the State Cauncil, and accordig to the Cotpehesive Standard of
Wastewater Discharge (GB8978-) and other relevant local standards, the -Shangbai Managerial
Rule on Emission Fee Collectign and Penalty' issued by Shangbai Municipal Government is enforced.
The colection of the emission fee is executed and managed by SEPB.
According to the principle of "user pays', the users, enterprises or institutions, which use the
combind sewerage system, should pay a tariff  This tariff is different from the emion fee: the
purpose of the emission fee is -to encomurage enterprises and institutions to stengthen their
management and admiion, to economize on and comprehensivey utilize resources, to control
pollution and to improve the evironment'; the tariff is required to maintai the norml operation of
the sewerage system. The collecdion of the drainage tariff is carried out by SSC.

accordance with Artcls 2 and 4 of the Waterpollution Prevention Act, efocing unified supevision
and manageme  of pollution prevention of this water body is the responsibility of SEPB (via the
Nature Protectxo  Department). Other agences, sch as the harbour    ineldcy. fisheries
administration, oceanographic authorities etc. work in coordination.
With refrn  to the function of the watr body and the natural situadon in the Cbangjiang etuLy,
the first concem is whether the dischargc would give rise to anry advese imaCt on the oveall
functIon of the Chanaiang esary. The second concern is whether there would be any potential
localized adverse consequence at the outfall and its viciity.
Routine or emergency monitonng conducted bY SEMC at Bailong Gang and its surrounding waters
would provide SEPB with an important basis for ensuring the proper supervision and management
of the esamry-
In addition, overflows can be caused either by nmoff or by accident, to the Huangpu River and its
trbutais. SEPB and the relevant LEPBs would be in charge of moitoring and management of this
aspect
122.3  Co-ordition of Managerial Agencies
From the point ofview of systems ngneering, the process of wasewater generation to conneion
to the sewerage system and finally dischargmg into the enviromnt should not be scparatfe and the
management of different links should be coordinated. Any weak link could influence the effeul

12.2.3.2       Coordination of Managerial Actions:
the purpose of managing the users is to effectively operate the system, the purpose of managing the
conveyance and treament facilities is to attempt to limit the impact on the environent to within an
acceptable extent; the purpose of managing the receiving water body is to monitor the effectiveness
of the system and feedback the information in time to the two upstream subsystems so that appropriate
measures can be taken. Therefore, the coordination of the managerial actions is critical.
12.2.4 Preparation of Programme for Operational Management of the SSPTI System
For effective operation of the combined sewerage system. the following actions should be included:
*        Establishing the necessary regulations and systems to be enforced;
*        Controlling operations to minimize sewage overflow as far as possible;
*        Setting up a categorization and classification system for dealing with accidents;
*        Strengthening the management of wastewater from industrial users, etc.
A set of appropriate management programmes is essential to manage the operation of systm so that
the effectiveness of the project could be fully realized. The Construction Departmen of the Shanghai
Sewerage Project Construction Company (SSPCC0 has organized the engineering design institutions
concerned to prepare a 'Operation Management Programme for Shanghai Combined Sewerage Project
(SSPI)' (For Trial). In this programme, requirements are set for operation and maintenance of the

(1)    Conservation of waer resourmes: Reduction of wastewater dischages will lessen the burden
on the urban sewag system   There is potenial for water conservation not only by
industra users, but also by domestic users. Multiple use of water resouces sbould be
practsed. and low water consUMption processes and water recycling processe should also
be encouraged.
(2)    Enhancement of environmental conscousness: The obligaion of pollution control should
be enhanced to make a contnrbution to creating a better environmenL The emission fee
reminds wastewater discagers to carry out their duties and social obligations in pollution
control and environmental improvement, at the same time as encouraging the stegthening
of poOution control and migadon of potenta harm to environment, so as to reduc the
level of the discbarge tariff.
(3)    Publicising the principle of -user pays" for pollution contml facilities: The reason for
drainagetaiffs should be recognized so that an incentive to water conservation is provided.

12.33      Major RecIving Water Bodies
The Bailong Gang area is the receiving water body for- effluent from the system. Monitoring should
be carried out over a long-term prgrmme, including water quality, substate, ecology. During
precipitation, the major water bodies monitored would be those which recav the overflow from the
urban sewerage system.
The monitoring of the HUangpu River and its trlburiCs. and the inland water system of Pudong New
Area related to the SSPI should be conducted on the basis of a routine monitoring programme-

24    Set-Up of Monitoring Snstem
The monitoring programme should be set up to cater for three sitatons namely routine monitoring,
irregular ispection, and accident monitoring.
(1)  'Relar monitoring: Its purpose is to measure and supervise the quantity and quity of
users' effluent, so as to understand the sewage flow and quality in the sewerage system and
to control the effects of the urban sewage on the water environment. Thus a ratnl
deployment and operaion of the seweage facilities could be achieved, as well as poviding
the basis for issuance of discharge permits and collection of drainage tariff.
(2)     Irregular inspection: According to the infmation acquired from the regular monitoring,
irregulr sampling of the effluent flow quality could provide information about the actual
condition of the disgharge, and check the data collected by the regular monitoring for
controllmg the sewerage system and providing information for the managerial agencies
concerned.
(3)     Accident monitoring: In the event that the urban sewerage facilities are damaged either by
ificial causes, by natal causes, or envirnmental pollution was caused by an
nauthorised discharge connected to the sewerage facilities, tracing monitoring should be
conducted based on the area and location where the accident occurred, and on the
characristis of polmution sources wbere the ffluent could possibly have been released.
Dependig on the results of the monitorng, emergcncy measures could be taken SO that the
efficts of pollution could be minimized to safeguard people's lives and properties.

13.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
1.     The enviromental status of the Shalghai Scond Sewerage Project area is as follows:
*    The Huangpu River and its tributaries are the rcevig water bodies of effluent
generaed in the proposed sevice area of SSPII, and as a consequence dtey suffer
from organc pollution high oncrtions of chemical oxygen deand (COD) and
ammcinia-nitrogn. In addidon to the funcions of navigation, industrial and
agriral wat uses, the Huangpu River is also used as a water source for urban
water supply, and this is also dtreamed by pollution. The tributaries of the Huangpu,
in Puxi and Pudong. whose flow rely principally on the tid  oscillaton which is
normally blocked by sluice gates, are seriously polluted. There are also several water
intakes in these trmutaries for local water treatment works whose water quality is
iadeaely afeguaded at critical periods. Alhough water diversion from the
Changjiag estuary is used to replenish the flow in this tribtries and improve the
water qualiy, the salinity and silt conte  in th estuary are constraints on the
effectiveness of the diversion.
3   Withm the Changjiang estiary, diluton and dispersion is aided by the favourable
hydraulic conditions becaue of the very high rer discarge flows and strong tid
energy. Water qualit is influenced by river discharge flows from upsream, tidal
currents and coastal streams. The water frm   um is of fairy goo quality except
for COD, and      e-     en is sometnimes high during the drought season. The
dissolved oxygen is always at an adequately high level. The water body along the
shorelie adjommg Bailonggng has been seiously polluted by the existing sewage
discharge from th South Trunk outfall forming a black plume along the coasdme.
In this area the counts of colfom are high exceeding by margin the water qualty
standard limit. The esuay is influenced to some extent by saline mnsi  and has
a high silt conment. Levels of pollutants on the suspended solids are always aromnd
four orders higher tha  that in the water.  Beca    of the high silt load, the
tansmissivity of the water body is low, and algae growth has been inhibited so that
no red tde incident has occurred. Major fishig grounds are locaed outside the
esay, and the fishing catch fluctuates annually.
2.     It is expected that the implementation of SSPII wodd have a bearing on the economic
growth of Shanghai, the developmet of Pudong and an improvement in envirnmental
quality. as follows:
*    Diversion of the itercepted wastewater generated in the proposed service areas would
not only imwre the water rlated evro nent of the project area but also the water
quality of the Huangpu River. It could benefit the water intakes in inland waterways

and the Linjiang water intake on the Huangpu River as wuel as enhancing the water
quality at Daqiao Water hIake. The laer iake is part of the Shanghai Enviromene
Project which is presntly being implemented.  -
*    The proposed outfall of SSPI, Phase IL would discharge some of the industrial and
domestic was ater collected in the areas of Wuing and Minhang, which will
directy safeguard the major water intakes on the Huangpu River.
*    The jroject woudd provide part of the necessrv infrastucure for the susaiable
development of Pudong New Area.
*    An improvement in the water environment at Bailonggang would be expectad due to
decommissioning of the existing South Trunk Sewer beach outfall.
3.     Implementation of the project may result in some social impact, such as:
*    Acquisition or borrowing of land used for agricultre would decrease the per capita
cultivated land area available;
Resetdement of residens and enterprses would changc the livig and working
condions of residents and the production and employment conditions of enterises;
e    Construction activit  would distub the daily life and worldng conditions of
suroudig people and affect other social activities.
Impacts would be minimized if Ctac   im.plmented the project in strict accodane with
nonal and local policies and regultions, whilst carying out various mitgation measures.
4.     By using a  submeg  outfall with a diffuser system, an improvme  would be cxpeted on
the existing enronm  at Bailonggang. At the design flow of 1.7 million m3/d, a miing
zone, in which the dilution of the sewage is no greater than 50, is predicted to be around
0.5 to 3.2 km1 in area. The most unfavomrable hydological condition would be neaP tide
durmg the drought season, and the higp slack to early ebb m the tidal cycle. It is estmated
that the probability of inadequately diluted sewage rising the surface would be below 5%.
No coat with the -2m bathymetric contour would occur so that passage for fish migration
would always be maintained.
5.     Toxic and harmfl substances specified as Category I pollutan by the National Integrated
Wastewater Discharge Standard (GB8978-88) need to be carefully controlled because they
are persistent in name. Becamse of very strong river flows and a self-purification zone in
the Changliang estuary, the dissolved oxygen levd in the esuary is always at an adequately
high level. Thus, the Category II pollunts can be controlled on the basis of total limiting

loads.
The controlling load allocated for this project (not the poteal receivable load limit of
Changiang estay) can be defined as
*    5-day Bichemical Oxygen Demand (BOD.)                    190 t/day
*    Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)                             422 tlday
*    Ammonia-Nitrogen                                          47 t/day
*    TotalPhosphorus                                            7 t/day
6.     Based on an analysis of each paramete it is found that sewage treament could be lInited
to plminary treatment involvmg screing and aeratd grit removal for the present. This
will also avoid the generation of sludge and associated problems with treatment or landfill
and reduce the financial ivetme   Land should, however, be reserved for fiuur extesion
of tatm   facilities m order to meet more stingent regulations m the fimre.
7.     By using a submged outall with diffusers, the potentl impact on the existig ecological
balance would be minimised so that very limited adverse environmental consequences coud
be epected and no  utrophication problem would be foreseen.
-      l'bhe proposed outfall at Bailongang would have no adverse impact on er nlly
sensiive fes in the area such as water sources within the estury, water diversion for
inland waterway rplen  and the proposed Pudong Second nternationa Airport.
Conversely, benefts would be crated becaus of an improvemen in water quality at water
intakes in the inland waterways, and improveme  to the appearance of the sea near the
proposed Pudong Scwnd Ienational Airport.
9.     In order to increase the environmental effctiveness of this project, managment and
monitoring system should be established for the preparation, construction and operational
phases of the proje4. Major managent activities required during the pre-constrction
phase are land acquisition, resettlement and contractor tendeing; during the construction
phase they are the enforcment of evronmental impact migation measures; and during the
opetional phase thry involve segthing of system managemnt, and monitoring of
pollution sources, the outfal and the quality of the water envimen in the Cbangiang
Estuary, and in particular the strict control of Category I pollutant disharges.

(GB3S38-M)
Issued by NEPA on the 5th April 1988
and in effcct on the Ist Junc 1988
I  Functional Classification of Water Bodies
According to the use purposes and protection objectives. surface water bodies are classified into 5
categories:
Category 1  mainly applicable to source water and national natural protection areas;
Category 1' mainly applicable to first class protection areas for centralized domestic potable water
sources, precious fisheries protection areas, and fish and shrimp spawning grounds;
Category III mainly applicable to second class protection areas for centralized domestic potable
water sources. generad fisheries protection areas and swimming areas;
Catcgory IV mainly applicable to general industrial water uses and secondary contact recreational
water areas;
Category V  mainry applicable to agricultural water use areas and water areas for geneal aesthetic
enjoyment.
If one water body has multipile functions, the highest rank of the functions is the basis for
classification. If there is a seasonal function, the classification can be on a seasonal basis.
2  Water Quality Requirement
The standard stipulates that the water bodies for different functions should comply with different
standard values accordingly. nhe water quality requirenments for the 5 categories of surface water are
shown in Table 1.
2.1 This standard should not be used for instantly observed values.
2.2 Exceedance of single stadard value indicates that the identified function is unable to ensure The
harmfulness should be integrally assessed refening to the baseline and the investigation data of
aquatic biota, hardness rectifying equation and related criterion information.

B.1    The Dil Modelig Studies
The Danish Hlydraulic Instte (DIII) has camed out moddling studi to imvestigate the impact upon
water quality from the proposed SSPII outfall at Bailouggang. he study i not completed. An interim
report was presented in Febnruay 1995, on which this summary is based.
The modeling work covers a 2D computer simulation for the far-fidd, and a 3D computer simuation
in the near-field.
In addiiion to the simulaions the DHI have analyzed different outfal schemes.
1.     Simulatio-s
1.1    Far-fidd
A calibrated 250 m grid hydrodynamic model is the basis of the water quality simulations. Six outfalls
and rivers are included:
-    Huangpu
-    Westem outfal
-    Souther outfal
-    Zhuyuan outfal
-    Yuelong Non-erric
-    Baosha Stel
Six components was considered in the caibration nm (Coliform, BOD, DO, Ammonia, Nitrate and
Phosphate), and both the wet pd dry seasons were included.
The calibrated model was used for 21 water quality simuations. These include variations of the
following parameters:
a) Period:    -      Summer
irmter
b) Phase:    -       Pbase I with a discharge of 1.7 mill m31d
-       Phase 1 with a discharge of 5.1 mill m1d
c) Diffuser:   -     C;  4 or 8 risers with a distance of 40 m between each
other
-       Separated, 4 risers with a distance of 160 m between each other

1.2    Near-field
A thee-dimensional model with grid-size of 40 m (horizontal) and 2 m (vertical) was set up and
calibrated. The water qualiy simutions included 10 runs with different periods, phases, diffusers
and loading.
2.     Outfal Schemes
The following schemes are analyzed:
I. All future outfalls located at Bailonggang
H.  One outfall at Bailongpng. Another outfall located 2 kn upsram of Bailonggang
and the last one 2 lan downstream
M.  One outfall at Bailonggang. Another outfall located apprmx. 11 km upstream of
Bailonggang and the last one approx. 10 km downstram.
For each scheme it has been looked into both smgle and twn outfall options and the following
diffuser layouts:
1)   concenrated diffuser with 4 risers spaced 40 m
2)   separated diffusers with 4 rises spaced 160 m
3)   concentated diffusers with 8 risers spaced 40 m
4)   for twin outfall or more. Concentrated diffuser with 4 rises spaced 40 m and offfset
by 40 m.
3.      Results and Discuson
3.1    The differet Phases
The Phase I sewerage discarge (1.7 mIl m3/d) will be at the Bailonggang area The outfal will be
about 1,500 m off the coast, and the diffuser secton will be located at the water depth of 6-10 in In
general, all simated results show that the Phase I discbarge with the present loading concentation
will cause a minor polluted area in the near-field. The plume length are quite limited and the edge
of the plume never comes doser to the river bank than 700 m. This means tht the pltum  do not
reach the bank and there is passageway for the fish migration.
The ultinme phase is with a discharge of 5.1 mill mr3/d. If this sewerge will be totally discharges

an one place, it will certainly generate a heavy pollution in the near-fidd and a significant
evinmental impact in the far-field. The plumes vnll reach the rver bank.
3.2     Different types of diffusr
The different types of diffusers will not influence the environmenal impact in the far-field.
The 3D results show that the ty  with 8 nsers will not give a better dilution than the type with 4
risers. On a contrary due to the short distn.e of deep waters, some of the 8 risers may be located
in a relative shallow position. and as a result of that the BR type cause higher pollution than the 4R
type.
3.3    Different Schemes
Three difFerent schemes are studied. The main diffrence between them is thc distnces between the
outfall. The diffrent schemes are only related to the ultimate phase with 5.1 mill mN3d.
Schem  I will case higher concentration of the polluans in the Bailonggang area, but the pollution
area is relatively smaler than the two other schemes
S me 11 can visibly reduce the high toncentation in the Bailongng area and also form a narrow
passageway between the edge of the plume and the rier bank for fish migration.
Becau  of the ditanes between the outfall of Scme M are sfficiendy long for an effective
dilution, the influence bwen  the outfall is quite small. Thus, the environmenl impacts from
Scheme m can be considered similar to the situation of Phase I at three different areas. Therefore,
Scheme m gives the smallest envinental impacts as compared to the two other schemes.
3A     Different Loads
The simuLted results show that the pollution area is very small for Phase I discharge, even with a
BOD concentration of 200 mg/I. It is clear that the pollution loadings of the Phase I discharge very
quicldy can be diluted in the lare water body at the Bailonggang area if the BOD concenation is
100 mg/l in the effluent, the pollution from an oall discharge will be very limited-

B.2    The Eagnhou Bay Envronmena  Study
SUMMARY
Thi study has been commissioned by the World Banc, and conmnenced in September 1993- The
completion date is scheduled to be end of October 1995.
The study comprise three phases:
Phase I:     D         of ecisting conditions
Phase II:    Analysis of emissions and an assessment of the assimiative capacity of the
bay
Phase III:    Environental protection and management plan. This is to include costed
action progammes and fiacial plan, plus reommed ons oninstiional
regulatory arrangements.
Phase I is completed and reported in a Final Report, May 1994. Fr   Phase H there is an Interim
Report, Octaober 1994, and a Final Report, March 1995.
The objective of the Hangzhou Bay Environmental Suy is to provide aneffective series of initiatives
to develop and maintain a balance beweem the various uses of the area. To achieve dtis it is necessary
to detennine the environmental stamus of die bay, and to determine the ramaining self purification
capacity of the bay to assimilate waste.
In the report from Phase I water qulity data are presented and compared with national marine water
standards. It is stated that the bay is hypeeutrphic with respect to both nirogen and phosphorus.
Zinc is the only heavy metal which ceed the sandard for fisheries protection. Copper levels are at
or near the limit for the same standard. Oil is beieved to fail the standard, but the data quality are
limited.
In the Phase I report there is presented a preliminay assessment of water quality objectives, set
against nationa standards (the pwposed new five class system for Marine Water Classicatio). Cls
2 zones include food reld    ses, eg fisheries and mariculture. They represent a substntial
proportion of the bay. most of which, on phosphate concentraton. is currendy in Class 415. and Class
5 or worse based upon nitrates.
It is recommended that a five year objective could be to limt the rate of cutrophication so that a
maximum proportion of waters are mntaind in Clas 3, and to seek improvement to Class 2 watcr
over a 20 year period. To reduce the risk of red tides the stategic control of either ortho phosphates

or nitrogen is to be considdred.
The smdy ara, which is Changiang Esay and Hangzhou Bay. receives pollution discharges from
various sources. These are river boundaries (bewen rnrs and the study area), point sources
(domestic and industrial wastewaer. drainage canals etc), non-point sources (agriacltural run-off etc.),
solid dumping (night soil etc.). and marine dscharges (oil from shipping etc.). Some data are
presented in the Phase I report. These shows that the loads for all parameters are dominted by those
delivered by the Changjiang into the East China Sea, with a part being carried into Hangzou Bay.
The significance of the Changji:mg loads is realised when one sees that the total ammia N discharge
from other sources is only 7.6% of the total load discharged. The modelling to be carried out will
use the pollution loads as input data from which the water quality in the bay will be calculated-
Some short term actions are identified in Phase 1. It is recommexded that atention is given to reduce
the zmc quantity by controlling waste from industry, prinarily the non ferrous metal industry. The
policy of waste minimiisaon at source should be encouraged.
S
For copper, which concentrations are at or near the desired quality limits,    oendations are that
discharge of additional matrials should be considered carefilly an individual basis. When it comes
to mntrients, the Phase I report advises that any remedial action should be delayed until more
information is known of relative sources of both nitroge and phosphous.
In the first stage of Phase 1 the main tasks have been the development of bydrodynamic and water
quality models, and to conduct a first marine nmniorng cmuise The initial results from this cniise
are confirming that the key-issues to be considered during the remainder of the project, are nutrients,
oils and trace metals.
Regardig nutrients a number of subjects are under further investigation. Among these are relative
contnrbuton of the various sources of nitrogen and phosphorous, and the implications of various
strategies for wastwatr treatment throughout the relevant cachments.
In the conclusions of the Interim Report from Phase IL it is also mentioned that 'the experience
gained during the development of this study has shown that the identification if functional znes
within Hangzhou Bay and the Zboushan Fishing Gromund and the ageement of Water Quality
Objectives will be a complex task'.
Important aspects of the Phase n Fmal Report are as follows:
-    Improved sampling and analytical methods have shown that earlier analyses of
concerations of dissolved toxic metals are too high and that all waters monitored
meet the marine standard.

C.   WASTEWATER TREATMNT
C.l.   Itoducion
The urban population of Shaighai is some 8 million. The domestic waste from this population and
some 20000 factories has traditionally been discharged to the Huangpu River. The average flow of
the Huangpu is 300 n3 Is and this sizeable flow provides significant dilution but nevertheless severe
polludon of the minor waterways within the city occurs.
To overcome these problems a wastewater masterplan has been developed and dts is based upon the
transfer of wastewater for discharge into the massive flows of the Yangtse River. At present, in 1995,
three major sewers have been constructed to discharge to the ChangJiang and the SSP2 sewer is at
the planning stage:

Irils     m3/s
The Western Sewer           Shidongkou              1.5        8.1
The Southern Sewer          Bailnggang             4.6         4.6
The SSPI Sewer              Zhuyuan                11.6       16.2
The SSPII - Stage 1         Bailonggang                       19.7
Stage 2             Bailonggang                       39.4
The Total Year 2020 Flow                                     88 mI3s
The average flow of the Changjiang is 31000 m3%s and threfore in the year 2020 the dilution frmn
the full flow of the Changjiang will be 350 :1. Even at the low flow of 7000 m31s a dilution of 80 :1
is provided.
With such massive dilution it is unlikely that any form of treatment would be necessary. The Royal
Commission Standards which were developed in the U.K. have been very widely applied as a means
of controlling watewiater pollution to levels which can be accommodated by a river system without
creating objectionable conditions. These standards suggest a limit of 20 mg/l BOD and 30 mg/l
Suspended Solids when a dilution of 8: 1 is available. This implies that it is normally acceptable to
increase the concentrtion of BOD and SS in a river by 2.5 and 3.75 mgll respecively.
Clearly it is not necessary to treat to a 20130 standard when very lrge dilutions are available and it
is normally accepted that treatment is not necessary for domestic wastewater when a dilution in excess

In the sections below the pollution loads which will be handled by the SSPII sewer are estimated,
the efacts of these discharges upon the receivig waters are considered and a pollution control policy
is developed from which the treaent requiremens for the SSPH wastewater are established.
C.2. The Sewage Flows and Pollution Leads
it is proposed that SSPII should be developed in stages. The first stage, which is due for completion
by 1998. will involve the constuction of sewerage and transmission works to serve the following
areas:
The Pudong New Area
Wujing / Minhang
Puxi South Block
By 2006. the Middle and Southern transfer systems are expected to be at such a stage that the Puxi
Middle Block can be served.
The Puxi North Blorck and the Free Trade Area (Gao Qiac) will not be served by these panned works
but will eventally be served by a North conveyor and outfall. However when considerng the
environmental impact of discharges to the Changjimg esary and the treanent requirements the total
discharges ust be considered.
The population served by the SSP II works has been estimated to be 3.2 million for the year 2000
and the domestic wastewater flow 444850 n9Id. This compares with a total estmated Stage 1 dry
weather flow of 1.9 million m3/d. FUII details of the esdmated flows and their sources throughout the
period to the year 2020 are presented in Table C.1.
The estimation of pollution loads presents greater difficulty than the estimation of flows:
There are several thousand factories and the individual discharges are not well known for
each parameter of interesL
Many of the populaton are at present served by septic tanks or mightsoil disposal facilities.
It is not possible to collect fully represetative samples for analysis.
Under these cirmstaces it is necessary to prepare estimates of the wastewater quality upon the
bases of typical data and the limited known infomation. Two separate approaches have been adopted
and these are presented below.

The Estimated Loads and Qualit of SSPI Wastew_r
As a part of the Hangzhou Bay Study, poUution loads enternmg the study area have been assessed and
forecasts have been prepared dmough to the year 2013. This assment covers the loads produced
by Shanghai and also the loads carried by the Changjiang at Xilujin which is upstrcam of the
confluence with the Huangpu. These data are of a generalised nature but nevertheless are useful in
assessing the effects of the Shanghai discarges upon the quality of the Changjiang.

The idustria loads are based upon 1990 values taken from th Shanghai Enviromnent News, Feb.
18, 1995 and uprad for the forecasts. The base 1990 loads used are shown in Table C.3.
The data can be treated with reasonable confidence smce a balance of pollutant loads generated and
discharged has been undertake and the results chedced against the measured loads crossing the river
boundary at Yangsbupu. A suprisingly good agreemen was foumd between the 'Estimated" and
'Measured' values for the water quality at the Yangshupu river boumdary. Good agrement was also
achieved for die four otder river basins studied, including the CharWiang basin.

5 % p.a. from the base year of 1990 to 1993 and thlrafter start to rise. The industrial flows quoted
in Table C.3, for the year 1994 reflect ese changes. In preparing forecasts of future loads a low
growth rate of 1 % p.a. has been used and a high estimate, based upon a growth of 2 % p.a., 1-
been used for sensitivity analysis.
Industrial records for the discharge of phosphorus are very srse. The pollution balance shows that
little phosphorus can be prese  in the industrial wastewater if the per capita discharge is 2
gm/capitalday. The estmates of Inorgamc Nitrogen are based upon the findings that for 605 major
factories in the Upper Huangpu area the inorganic nitrogen content was equal to 5.25 % of the COD.
Data for metals were found to be inconsistent. The concentrations of phenols are only relevant if the
receiving water is to be used for drindkng purposes whicb is not the case for any discharges to the
Changjiang esmary since the high salinity precludes such a use.

In (d) above the pollutant load estmates are shown as_ming tha all domesic vrastewater enters the
sewerage system. At present this is not the case. The Solid Waste Study showed that in 1993 86 %
of the population was served either by septic tanks or by nightsoil dump tanks. However some 62 %
of the solids from these tanks was esmated to be returned to the s'ewerage system.
In section (e) above the estimated pollution loads camed by the SSPI sewer are presented having
made an allowance for the septc tank and nightsoil sludges not discharged to the sewer. A

From the above load esftimat and the flow data prsented in Table C.1, esta  cam be pepared
for the concentratons of pollutants m the SSPI wastwater. These estimates are of course based upon
the assumption that the factories to be served by the SSPII system are reprcsentaive in terms of the
average int  pollution levels experienced in Shaha.

Note: Bracetd figums reprs  the higher estmates of indusaWl disharges
t can be seen that these estimates compare wel with the measured concenation of polluts in the
SSPI sewage, as quoted above.
In the evaluation above no allowance has been made for the removal of polhltants by use of nightsoil
or septic tank facilities. By the year 2000 it is expected that the quantities of nightsoil and septic tmak
sludges will be small with mos dischaged to the sewer. In these cirumstace a reduction of the
load to allow for these other means of disposal is inappropriate. It can be seen that the wastewat
is paticulay weak when compared with nonmal domestic waseat. This is believed to be due
to the dilution provided by infiltration water and the weak naure of the industrial wastes.
In Table C.5 data are presented to cover population, flow and pollution load projections for the years
2000, 2010 and 2020. The population and flow data re as presented in he Predesign Review Report.

handled by the SSp II Sewers. The industrial pollucion load growth rate used is 1 % p.a. after 1993.
The flows upon which the load esimates are based are shown in tic tablc and also in Figure C.1. The
poUutant loads are presented in Table C.5 in tlday and the concentraions are also shown for the
individual pollutant.
It is notable that the concentations are very low. as for SSP 1. BOD concentations are estimated to
fall from 89 to 73 mg/l during the development of the scheme and the other parameters are
correspondingly low with concentrtions reducing, due largdy to the higher per capita domestic water
consmption anticipated for the later yezrs.
The low concentaons obseved and estmated are very largely due to the very large industial
wastemer flows It is possible that. a positive waste mmisation progrmme would have very
beneficial effects in reducing industrial water consumption and wastewater discharges. Such
progranmnes however require a sustied cffort over a long period and one cannot usually achieve
i_mediate or short term improvements.
A worst case projection of pollution loads has been prepared and the data are presented in Table C.5.
For this extreme case it has been assumed that the industrial loads discharged increase at a rate of 2
% p-a. and that the increases inflows is held at I % p-a., additionaly, the per capita domestic loads
have been taken to rise by 10, 20 and 30 % in the years 2000, 2010 and 2020, over the base levels.
For xamuple, BOD discharges are taken to rise to 44, 48 and 52 gmlcapitalday in these thrce years.
It can be seen from the data presented that the BOD is projected to rise from 97 mg/l in 2000 and
down to 91 mg/l in 2020. Even under this extreme case BOD concentrations are very low, the faU
between the years 2000 and 2020 being due to the increase in the domestic water use.
Waste _0lniisation
From the data presented above a nmmber of key points occur:
The wastewater in the SSPI sewer is very weak.
The estimatd quality indicates tht wastewater in the SSPII swer wilU also be weak.
Reference to the individual flows of domesic and industrial  stewater show that it is the industrial
component whicrh is particularly weak in terms of BOD and COD. There are two possible reasons for
this. The efforts made by the factories in treatng dteir wastes to meet disharge standards has no
doubt resulted in significant pollution load removal. The second reason for the weak induia
wastewater is possibly due to excse use of water within the fictories, particularly the older
factories where litde consideration was given in the past to economy in water use.
The low concentrtions in the SSP I sewer could also be caused in part by high infiltration in the

older parts of the system. It would be surprising, with the massive reonaruction in progress, if
existing drams have rane  intact. A recent study in the U.L has shown that over 7.4 % of
drainage areas have infiltration contnrbuting more than 0.5 timcs dry weather flow.
From the above findings it is stongly recommended dat a long - term programme of waste
mnimisation be instiuted.
C3.  The Effects of the Wastewater Discharges
The Chinese National wastewater discharge stndards, GB 8978 - 88. are presented in two sections.
The Category I pollutants are toxic chemicals and all discharges must meet the requirements of the
Stundard. These are shown in Table A.6. At this stage it is not possible to collect a reprsentative
sample of the wastewater and therefore compliance with these requirements cannot be checked.
Samples of SSP I wastewar are being collected and analysed to serve as a guide but realistic samples
camot be collected until the sdceme comes into operation. With the high flows carried by the system
it is unlilkdy that difficulties will be experienced in meeting the requirements.
Even if it is found that a problem exists the solution is to find the indusi source and to deal with
the problem there rather than to treat the whol flow.

Note (5) of the standard is relevant in that it explains that the stndard quoted for phosphate (P)
applies when the discharge is to stnding watars, for example lakcs and rescrvoirs.
Tbe Class I is applicable when the receiving water is to be used for drinking use. Class 11 is evidently
considered relevant to discharges to estuaries.
Of particular relevance to dte discharges to the Chanxjiaug are the surface water classifications as
presented in Table C.8. This is a Shanghai Standard particularly applied to surface waters in the
Shanghai area.

This standard provides useful guidance by study of the pollution loads enteing a water course and
the effect that this will have upon the quality of the receiving water.
Class 1 and Cla   2 waters are used as sources of drinkng water. The Changjiang estuary is
categorised as Class 3 whilst the less strngent CLass 4 covers a surface water Ofor industrial. sceni
and agricultural use, operation of harbours and marine development".
The National Surface Water Standard for Category m  waters is "mainly applicable to second dass
protection areas for centralised domestic potable water sources.general fisheies protection areas and
swimming areas".
In the following sections the discharge of waste water into the Changjiang is in relation to the
requirements for the Shangi Class 3 and the National Category m  waters.
Data generated by the Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Centre was assessed as part of the
Har.. hzhou Bay Study and it was found that the average pollution loads carried by the Changjiang
over the period 1988 to 1992 are as shown in Table C.9. Also shown in this table are the high
esimates of the loads for the year 2020 which are taken to enter the Cbangjiang in untreated ShangWai

Whilst data in this table provides only a crude estimate some iteresting factors emerge:
The BOD is well witbin the Class 3 and Category II Standards
The COD in the Chanjiang upstream of Shanghai is well above the Shanghai Class
3 Standard and therefore whatever treatment is provided for the Shanghai wastewater
the Class 3 Standard cannot be met for the COD. The concenations are however
well within the more realistic National Standard of 15 mg/l.
The Ammonia levels mee requiements under mean flow conditions
The Surface Water Standard does not cover either total or ortho phosphoms, however
the Draft New Marine WQ Standards quote 0.015 mg/I as an Ortho - P standard.
Data for the Changiiang has not been identified but it is clear that the esdmate of the
2020 contribution from Shanghai is very low with respect to the standard.
The National Stndard calls for a total P of 0.1 mg/l. It can be seen that this canmot
be achieved due to the hih levels of Total P in the Changjiang upstream of Shanghai.
It can further be seen that the Shanghai contribution to the load amounts to only
0.005 mg/l.
A far more rigorous evaluation of the effict s of the Shanghai discharges upon the quality of water
in the Changjiang estuary has been carried out by the Danish Hydraulics Institute and the East China
Normal University.
In this study a wide range of conditions have been evaluated including several outfdli and diffuser
layout options, seasonal changes in flow in the Changjiang and several sets of disharge load data
Madthmatical Modelling has been used and the results from the 2D model, with a 250 m grid spacng
have been studied. Key results are those covered by the DMI cases FW3, FW6, FW13 and FW21 are
the Most relevant since they covcr the poBlution loads forecast here for the Phase 1 and Phase 2
developments. These test cases cover the following conditions:
FW3 Phase 1 polludon loads, summer conditions.
FW6 Phase 1 pollution loads, winer conditions.
FW13 Phase 2 pollution loads, sumner conditions.
FW21 Phase 2 pollution loads, winter conditions
The key conclusions from this work are seen to be as followss:
The lowest concentration of disslved oxygen found was 6.7 mg/1. This complies
with the Surface Watez and the Marne Water Class 1 requirements and indicates that
problems of oxygen deficiency are not to be expected even with untread Phase 2

discharges from Shanghai. Clearly the BOD discharged is not of significance.
This conclusion is confinned by monitoring results from the HZB study:
"The geographic distnbution of dissolved oxygen shows the entire study area to be
well witin Class I  (of the Marine Standard)
The conclusion to be drawn is that the Proposed BOD discharges will not cause
problems.
The above conclusion is confirmed by the DHI modelling of BOD. For all four cases
the maximum concentration of BOD predicted was 3.49 mg/I and only very small
areas experience this concentration.
Ammonia concentrations cause no problems for the Phase I discharges with the
maximum value observed being 1.19 mg/l. Whilst this marginally exceeds the
Shanghai Class 3 Surface Water Standard (1 mg/l) the area affected is very small and
the problem only occurs for short periods of the winecr wben the water temperatures
arc low. This level is well within the National Standard for un-ionised ammonia being
equivalent to 0.012 mg/l. The summer maxinnum for ammonia N was found to be
0.34 mg/I.
It is not the ammonia N concentration which is significant in tenms of toxicity to fish
but rather the concentration of un-ionised anmonia, i.e. NH]. This is reflected in the
Chinese surface and manne stndards. The surface water stndard for waters of
Classes I. II and mI is 0.02 mg/l for um-ionised ammonia.
The relationship between un-ionised ammonia and the ammonia N. as measured,
depends on the pH and temperatu of the water and is covered by the following
relationship:
NH3 (un-ionised)    = Ammonia NI(1 + 10')
Where               x =  11(0.09912 + 0.00036r) - pH
and                 T  = Tempemture -C
For the winter conditions which are critical, the temperare and pH of water in the
Chanijiang estuary are 5 -C and 7.9 rspectively. Use of these values in the above
equations shows the following:

NH3 (un-ionised) = I % of de ammonia N as measured.
The modelling results of DHI show die ammonia N concenration to be less than 2.0
mgfi under all conditions and therefore the concentration of tde un-ionised anmmonia
is expected to meet the requirements for the Class I surface water
The. HZB monitoring showed there to be no problems due to Ammonia toxicity
within the bay and has concenrated upon the levels of inorganic nitrogen which is
a nutmient source for algae. The total inorganic nitrogen has been found to be high
and in some areas the Marine Class 4/5 requirement for 0.7 mg/l cannot be met.
There is therefore concern regarding the levels of the nutrients, both N and P.
particularly since there exists a log - standing problem of the 'Red Tides".
However the wtal discharge of inorganic nitrogen at present discharged from
Shanghai is calcuated to be only 2.7 % of that carried by the Changjiang. Under
these circumstances it is essential to control the disbcharges in the Changjiang basin
if any real impact is to be made upon the marine envimoment.
The monitoring of Hangzhou Bay has shown there to be no problems io the general
study area of dissolved toxic metals but this is not to say that there may not be
problems in the vicinity of individual outfails or pmblems in specific areas where
metals may have been deposited with sediment.
If such problems are identified it is seen that the solution should be to control the
dicharge from the offending factories and certainly it would not be appropriate to
provide the necessary treatment in a central treament works.
Whilst the Chaniiiang Estuary and the Hangzbou Bay Studies are not yet complete. our preliminary
conclusions from these assessments can be sunansed as follows:
Dissolved oxygen and BOD discharges are unlikely to cause problems and priority
shodd not be given to the removal of BOD from the SSP H wastewater.
Both nitrogen and phosphorus are at high levels in the HZB study area and are
thought to contnbute to the well kmnown problems of the 'Red Tides".
The contribution of N and P by Shanhai is minimal compared with the loads
dischwged by the Changjiang into the East China Sea. For this reason there is no
inmmediate urgency to provide more than prelimiary treatment for the Phase 1 SSP

II discharge.
In the longer term Shanghai should play its part in the raduction of nutrient loads to
HZB and dhe East China Seas. The control of phosphorus is more practical and
effective dhan the control of nitogen. It is proposed tWrefore that a policy of
phosphorus control should be adopted for the later sages of the project.
CA4.  The Approach to Tveatment of SSP  Dischrges
As seen above there is no case for any tremnt of the SSPI wastewater other than to provide
prelimary treamet The works required essentially comprise screeimg and grit removal to ensure
that the outfall and the outfall pumnpig staion can operate effectively and reliably.
It is however proposed that Shanghai should take a lead in the control of nuurients which contrbute
to the problems of the Red Tides.
In the sections below a straty is developed whereby the discharge of Phosphorus from the whole
of Shanghai, not merely the SSPD discharge, is held constant beyond the year 2000.
Tn Treatment Process
In Table C.10 the estmates of the total discharge loads frm Shanghai, for BOD, Inorganic N and
Total P are presented dhrough to the year 2020. Also shown is the increase in the loads above the year
2000 values. By taking the ratios of dhese last two sets of numbers the percentage removal required
for each pollutant, to restrict the loads discharged to the year 2000 values are shown in the last but
one column.
In Tablc C. l 1. the cffectiveness of a range of altemnave wastewater treamet processes in achieving
these objectivde is shown. The shaded areas imply that the process cannot meet the objectives. Of
prime imprnce, as shown above is the conmtrol of phosphorus discharges. It can be seen that the
only process which can meet the reqiremen  is chemically assisted primary tratnenL Conventional
primary treamuent camnot meet the requirments for any of the pameters. Conventianal secondary
biological treatment could hold BOD loads discharged to the year 2000 values and if this were
designed for mtrificaion and denitrification theD  both the BOD and the nitrogen loads could be
controlled.
Since the key parameter is phosphoms. in terms of the impact upon the marine environamet, the
chemically assisted primary settlement has been selected.

Appmisul Repoft - Volme 4:TEwiromActdl AssessmM
The Capacity and Perfonnance of the Works
In order to control the discharge loads to year 2000 values it will be necessary to construct works to
start operating in about the year 2005. Such a works should have the capacity to deal with the loads
up to about 2010 when a second stage woud be required.
hm Table C.11 it is shown that it wil not be neessary to treat the whole flow. Upon th basis of the
estimated futme flows and loads a treat_ent woris of 800,000 mid would be adequate to meet the
year 2010 needs and-:his would require extension to a capaciy of 2.1 million m=/d in the year 2015.
The impact of the implemeion of the proposed  etment works upon the dscharges of total
phosphorus and BOD are shown in Figure C.2 and the estimate of the fiue loads and concentrations
of key pollutants are shown in Table C.12 together with the Nationl Stndards. It can be seen that
as the development procceds full complianmc is achieved.
aearly it will be necesary to review the treatment needs prior to the designs of these works so that
account may be taken of the more recent flow and load data.
The conclusions can therefore be su_mmrised as follows:
Preliminary Treatment is required for the Phase I works.
A policy of phosphorus control is proposed as a means to assist in the control of
adverse envfomental conditions created by the Red Tides in the East China Seas.
It is proposed to instal chemically asssted setlement in about the year 2005 and in
subsequent years of sufficient capacty to limit the total discrge of phosphorus from
Shangai to the year 2000 loads without the need to construct additonl such works
elsewhere.
Present estimates indicate the timing and capacity of the works to be as follows:
Stage 1 Works 0.8 million rn3 Id 2005
Stage 2 Works 1.3 million m3/d   2015
Outine designs and cost estimates are beig prepared for such works for inclusion
in the finacial analysis.
The sludge loads from the wor,ks have been assessd and it has been found that these
can be adequately handled in the planned areas for landfill local to the site after

atment by gravity thidkening and dewang. Whilst chemically assisted settlement
produces larger quantities of sludge than does conventional prknary treatment, the
need to treat only a part of the flow assists greatly.
The impact of the implementation prograrme for team     , suggested above is
shown in Figure C.2. It can be seen that the phosphorus load discharged from
Shanghai Varies around the controlling year 2000 estimated load according to the
constucton programme. The figure also sbows that the works proposed are also
effective in liniting the BOD discharge.
These concepts have been developed with close coopeaton betwee SSPCC. the SEPB, Sogreah and
the Interconsult teams. It is believed that this is a far reaching concept and shows the commitment
of the Shanghai Municipal Goverment to the protection of the marine environment.

D.     ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITr
D.1    The future poluto loads into the Han}_
The Pollution Load Model, developed as a part of the Eangho  Bay Study, has been used to assess
the effects of the SSP 1 sewerage upon the quality of water in the Huangpu at Yangshupu. This
includes the effects of the colection of the wastewater rom the Minhang and Wujing areas into the
first stage of the S$P II scheme.
The prediction assumes that all connections to the sewerage system are completed by the year 2000
for the first stage of the schcme and by the ycar 2010 for the full scheme. This will require a major
effort since in most counties it would be cxpected to take betwee five and ten years to make aIl of
the connections. The predictions also assume that aU of the other sewerage systems, including SSP
I are brought to full design capacity.
Even after the sewerage schemes are completed and all connections made, thrae will be residual
pollution remaining in the sediments of the river and the minor waterways of the city. This is
expected to be a particular problem in Shanghai where t  termain is so flat and consequently the
gradient on the waterways is low and the flow velocities are low. It may thereforebe necessary to
undertakle such measures as flushing and perhaps dredging before the fall benefits of the sewerage
are observed. Certainly it wil be essential to control the present practice of dumping of soLd waste
into the city waterways before clear attave waterways can be ensured.
The results of the projections are shown in the enclosed figure. The pollution loads in the Huangpu
at Yangshupu are expressed in terms of tonnes/day. Also shown in the figure is the contribution to
the total loads created by the drainage from rural agrictre. It should be noted that pollution loads
from this source are a part of the loads shown to be carried by the Huangpu.
It can be seen that the SSP II sewerage project will reduce the BOD loads at Yangsbupu by more than
50 % at the first stage. As time proceeds the pollution loads generated in the city are seen to rise but
the sewerage project. when completed can handle almost all of the city loads.
From the year 2010 onwards the loads in the Huangpu become dominated by the pollution generated
in the rural areas. This is particarly string for the inorganic nitrogen loads. These arise manly
from farm animal waste and fm the rn-off of fertiliser. Shanghai at present uses ferliser at much
higher application rates than the national average and the average use rate in the Chang Jiang basin.
If pollution of the river is to be controlled further. after the year 2010, it will be essential to control
agriculural run-off by such measures as betr control and tetment of animal waste and changes in
agricultual practice such as the use of slow release fertlisers and changes to the methods and tining
of fertiliser applications.

Appmisl Report - Volume 4:EDwhomiand Azsmem
The fotlowing conclusions can be drawn as to the environmental benefits of the SSP II sewerage:
*    The pollution loads, genrted from the city and carried by the Huangpu at
Yangshupu will be cut by about two thirds foilowing the inroduction of the first stage
of the SSP II scbeme for both of the important parmeters of BOD and inorganic
nitrogen.
\   *    The Second Stage of SSP 11 will reduce pollution to negligible levels.
* The discharge of agricultuwal wastes and fertiliser nm-off will become increasingly
important in terms of the effects upon the Huangpu and the city waterways.
*    If the full benefits of the sewerage scheme are to be realised it is essential that
connections to the sewers proceed as a matter of priority.
Measmures to overcome the effects of polluted muds in the city's waterways should be
put in hand as the sewerage schemes are introduced.
D.2    Secondary Benefits
In addition to the main dirct benefits of improvig the water qualiy in the rivers and caals, the
project will also have important secondary benefits. In short these are:
Health benefits, identified as the reduction m bealth treatment caused by a reduction m water bom
diseases for the part of the population that may be in contact with nightsoil or polluted canal and river
water. Included in the health benefits wDl also be an increased production value due tO reduced
absence from work. A reducton in waterborne diseases will also mean reduction in mortality caused
by the same diseases.
Increased  ropueR   values will be a consequence fro those areas along both sides of the Huangpu,
areas along canals and creeks west of Huangpu that will get cleaner water, and residential areas and
service sector in Pudong.
Aesthetic benefits; the seCrvice and tourism industries are considered to benefit from the project in the
sense that these indusri will not enjoy the expected growth in the fumer unless the enviroment is
improved.
Benefits to amiculkre from the project is the value of crops from land that may be imgated becaue
water in canals and creeks can again be used for irrigatior.
Dwelopmcnt benefit. To enable Sbanghai to fill its ambitions of becoming a trade, industrial and
fmance centre on the westcrn rim of the Paciic. the physical environment needs to be atctive to

foreign as well as domestic industries, and the basic infrastructr to ensure pollution problems are
mitigated needs to be in place.
Clearly, a project of this nue, whicb involves fundmal infiastructure required for public health,
nwst be viewed within the overall context of the future economic developmet of Shanghai,
particularly the Pudong AreaL If this infrast ure (or infrastructure providing a similar function) is
not provided, then the economic development of the Pudong Area would not be sustainable.

Es   COMBINED SEWMR OVERFLOW
An estimat of the combined sewer overflows has been made. The estimae was based on the use of
synthetic rs and hydraulic overland flow, collection and interceptor flow routing using a numerical
simulation model. The simulation results ar summaised in the enlosed Table.
With the proposed interception of wet weather flows, i.e. Inurceptor Ratios 1.5 and 3.0 for
catclments overflowing to Huangpu and smaller rivers and waterways. every year approximately 20
rainfall events were found to give overflows. Such overflows will on the average take place some 1
% of the time. If the precipitation is sufficiently intense over the entire service area, during some of
the events, all 11 overflow points might be overflowing simulyaeously.
The Table also shows that following Phase 1 and 2 implementation of the SSPI scheme, i.e. the
Middle and South Lines, the present annual discharge of some 215 m3 of wastewatr will be reduced
some 1.8 million m3 of combined sewer overflows. Some 1.15 mill m3, or 65% of the fture
combined sewer overflow volume, will be overflows from Puxi South Block, while the r
35% wMil be from overflows in the Middle Block.
Following implementation of the SSPII scheme, the volumetric reduction in was waer discharges
from the Puxi South and Middle Blocks will be close to 99%. However, because the combined sewer
overflows wfll be largely storm watr, the reduction in pollutants will be even larger dtan the
reduction in volume.

plan (RAP) and carried out the census and data collection in cooperation with the district-,
county-, township-, and village authorities. A number of surveys have aEto been carried out
by independent instituteslconsultants like:
*    Resettlemen impacts of SSPI. A survey of 45 households carried out by Gu Hua
Company.
* Willingness to Pay survey compnrising 200 households. Carried out by Gu Hua
Company.
*    The Legal, Economic and Socal Consulytan  Instits of the Shangai Academy of
Social Sciences has been appomted to monitor and evaluate the resettlement
programme. All villages and 30% of affected housebolds have been visited to control

EXECUTIVE SUMMLARY
Background
Shanghai. with a population of approximately 13 million peoplc and the People's Republic of China's
largest metropolitan area, is presendy enjoying an unprecedented economic growth. However, the
present urban services, and in particular the sewerage ard sanitation system is not compantble with
Shanghai's aspiratirFn to become a major ecoaomic and financial centre.
To improve Shanghai's sanitaion. and to reverse the deterioration in the water qualitr of the rivers
and canals in the metropolitan are brought about by discharges of indusrial wastes and untreated
sewage, the Shanghai Municipal Govemment (SMG) has begun a phased programme of
improvements. One of the major projects is the Shanghai Second Sewerage Project (SSPII).
in Shanghai, the Shanghai Sewerage Company (SSC) is responsible for management of the sewerage
system. The Shanehai Sewerage Project ConsEuction Companv (SSPCC) has been formed by SMG
to undertke project implemenmation.
SMG has requestmd the nterational Bank for Reconstruction and Dcvelopmcnt (Ehe World Bank) for
fnancial support to SSPII
The Environmentl Assessment Report (EA) for SSPII. Phase I. has been produced to meet the
requirments of the Government of the People's Republc of China and the World Bank- The World
Bank has 2dvised that te SSPII project is a Category A projecL Sbanghai Academy of Environmenal
Scie:ces (SAES) has been conmiissioned by SSPCC to prepare the EA.
The legal franework for the EA is the Environmental Protection Law, the Water Law, the Water
Pollution Prevention and Control Law. and the Land Mannement Uaw of the People's Republic of
China, together with a number of national and local regulations and standards based on these laws.
The SSPII Project
SSPU will collect wastewaaer from the Wujing and Minhang Industrial areas, from the Xuhui. Luwan.
Huanpu. Hongkou and Yangpu districts in Puxi. and from the Pudong New Are. Because of dte
substantial investments required, the SSPII project will be implemeented in phases. A priority has been
laid down for the order in which the SSPII drainage catchmenrs are to be served. The Phase I service
area will be the Wujing and Minhang industrial areas. the Xuhui and Luwan districts of Puxi, and 156
kmZ of the Pudong New Area. In total. the Phase I service area will cover 269.5 kmi with a
population of 2.8 million. The wsewater volume for Phase I is estimated to be 1.7 rillion rdJday,
while the ultimate flow (year 2020) is 5.1 million mniday.



-2-
The main components of the SSPI project are interception facilities. inverted siphons underneath the
Huangpu River and ocher water channels. sewage conveyors. wastewater treatment and sludge
handling facilities, and a submerged outfall into the Changjiang Estuary.
The total capital cost (including land) of the SSPII. Phase r. is estimated to be 5.177 billion Yuan.
The completion dare for Phase I is 1998.
E,dsting Water Environment Status
The Shanghai area has a network of rivers and canals. The principal river, the Huangpu. flows
through the metropolitan ara. The Huangpu is a tidal river with a net average flow of 341 m3Js. In
addition to the functions of navigation, industrial and agricultural water use. The Huangpu is also a
source of drinking water to the Shanghai area. The Huangpu receives the majority of the municipal
wastewarer. and is polluted. The water qualitv has been monitored at different sections of the river.
and the results show high contents of pollutmnts such as organic material (COD) and ammonia-
nitrogen.
The tributaries and canals connected to Huangpu are comrolled by sluicegatEs. These trbutaries are
generally heavily polluted ('black and stink") There are several water intakes in these trbutaries
supplying different townships with water.
The Changiiang (Yangee River), the longest river in China. flows to the north of Shanghai about 20
km away from the City Proper, and has an average flow of 29.300 m3Is. The Cbangjiang flows inm
the East China Sea. Bailonggang, which is located on the South Channel of the estuary. is proposed
as the location for the SSPII Phase I cutfalL The water quality around Bailonggang is mainly affected
by the river flow. the tide and the coastal curren A water qualiy survey indicaes that th water
qualirv is basically good, with a few exceptions. COD valucs indicate some pollution. and ammnonia-
ntroger. is affected by the water coming from upstm, especially during the drought season. The
dissolved oxygen is always maintaiined at a high level. The Changjiang carries silt from upstream to
the estuary and this has a significant impact on the esmary. The light transmitance is poor because
of the silt, and this restricts the growth and production of algae. thus preventing the occurrence .of
Red Tides.
At Bailonggang there is an cxisting outfall direcly to the beach (thc South Trunk Sewer). This
discharge causes serious pollution near the outfalL
Environmenl Benefits of the Project
The main environmental benefits of the SSP[I sewerage project will be improved water quality in the
Huangpu River and its tributaries. ln addition the project will allow the Pudong area t be developed
satisfactorily.



-3-
Water qualicy models for the river networks have been used to predict the water quality in rivers and
creeks. The results show that there will be an overall improvement in the water qualitv.
There are imporcanc drinking water supplies in the upper Hluangpu reaches, and the collectien and
interception of wasrewater from Wujing and Minhang areas will directly safeguard these water
intakes.
At Bailonggang the existing outfall will be abandonned and the sewage diverted into the proposed
submerged outfall. This will imprcve the local evirOnmemal simatidn considerably.
In addition to the direca positive environmental impact there will also be inporant secondary benefits
from the project. as: for example health benefits caused by a reduction in water bom diseases.
increased property values, aesthetic benefits and development benefits. A projea of this naure must
be viewed within the overall context of the futmre economic development in Shanghai, particularly
tQe Pudong area If adequate sewerage infrastructure is not provided, then the economic development
of the Pudong New Area would not be sustainable.
Adverse Environmental Impacts of the Project
Despite the fact that the project is designed to improve the eavironment, such a large projecr will also
have some unavoidable negative impacts. Of particular concern is the wasewater discharge to the
Cbangjiang Estuary, and impacts related to the construction period.
To estmate the quality of the SSPli sewage, samples have been tken from the SSPI sewage. Based
on this data, the foUowing loads are esmated from the SSPII sewage: BOD5 190 t/day, COD 422
tlday, NH3rN 47 t/day, Tot-P 7 tlday, based on a flow of 1.7 million nm/day.
Studies have shown that the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the Changjiang Estuary is always
at a high level. This indicates that problems with oxygen deficiency are not to be expected. BOD
discharges are dterefore unlikely to cause problems. and priority should not be given to the remnoval
of BOD from the SSPII discharge.
Nutrient levels and Red Tides are a problem in the Changjiang Estuary. Results from the Hangzhou
Bay Eavironmenral Study show high levels of both nitrogen and phosphorous in the smdy area, and
this is thought to conmbute to the problems of the Red Tides. However, the conribution of N and
P from Shanghai is mininal compared to the loads discharge by the Changjiang into the East China
Sea. For this reason there is no immediate urgency to provide more than prelhniary treatment for
the SSPII Phase I discharge. Land should. however, be ensured for future upgrading. A policy of
phosphorous control should be considered a: a later stage of the projecL
Simulations of the SSPII Phase I discharge show that at the discharge point there will be a mixing
zone, in which the dilution will be less than 50, extending to betwecn 0.5 to 3.2 kmf. denendent on
the season. The probabilirv of pollution rising to the surfacc of the estuary is less than 5%. and the



-4-
plume will not reach the river bank. A passage for fish migration will thus be preserved.
Imiplemenataion of the SSPII project will require permanenm and temporary acquisition of farrrm nd,
demolition of houses, and cause interferece to water and land aispormaion. The land acquisition
and resettlement will be handled and compensated for in accordance with national and local policies.
A Reselement Action Plan (RAP) 'is under preparation. To minimize the irnpact from the
construction period, different mitigation measures will be put into action. A summary of these is
enclosed.
Conclusion
The Environmental Assessment is based on scientific studies and modelling work, and the main
conclusions are:
The adverse environmental impacts from the SSPII are limited. The wastewater discharged to the
Changjiang Esmary at Bailonggang will effectively be diluted and dispersed into the very large wa:er
body with only minor irnpacts.
During che consEruction period the potential adverse impacms are significant, and it is therefore very
impornt dat necessary mitgaton mcasurcs are  ken w-oavoid or limit these impacts.
The SSPII Project wlnl result in important elnvironmenal benefits:
SSPII will contrbute significantly to the improvement of water quality in the Huangpu
and its tributaries in Puxi and Pudong.
SSPII will eliminate the existing southern outfall at Bailonggang and thus improve the
local cnvironentL
SSPII is an importnt project for the development of Shanghai, especially the Pudong
New Area.
SSPII will improvc the sanitation systen and the waterways and thus be beneficial to
the inhabitants of Shanghai both in terms of health and in terms of quality of life.
