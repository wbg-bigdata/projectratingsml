MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A SECOND SHANGHAI SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the People's Republic of China for $250 million to help finance the
Second Shanghai Sewerage Project. The loan would be a US dollar loan at the standard
interest rate for LIBOR-based single currency loans, with a maturity of 20 years, including
5 years of grace. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent to the Shanghai Municipality
(SM) on the same terms and conditions, and a commitment charge at the Bank's standard
rate on the outstanding balance. SM would bear the foreign exchange risk. SM would
onlend the proceeds to the Shanghai Municipal Sewerage Company, Ltd. (SMSC) for 15
years including 5 years of grace at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar
single currency loans, and a commitment charge at the Bank's standard rate, with SMSC
bearing the foreign exchange risk.
2.    Sector and Project Background. Shanghai, China's largest metropolitan area, has
a population of about 14 million. The city is located on the lower delta of the Changjiang
(Yangtze) River, where it meets the East China Sea. Numerous watercourses flow through
the municipal area, mainly draining to the Huangpu River, which passes through the city
center and flows into the Changjiang. These watercourses are interconnected and tidal,
experiencing several hours a day of reverse flows during high tides. The waterways serve
many functions, including receiving stormwater, and industrial and domestic wastewater
flows. Currently, due to a lack of basic urban infrastructure, only about 48 percent of
wastewater flows [2.6 million (M) m3/day] can be collected, the remainder discharging
directly into streams or the Huangpu. Prior to the commissioning in 1993 of the main
interceptor financed under the first Shanghai Sewerage Project [Loan 2794/Credit 1779-
CHA (SSPI)], only about 0.5 Mm3/day of the 5.4 Mm3/day of wastewater flows was
collected by combined (wastewater and stormwater) sewers.
3.    Less than two thirds of wastewater collected receives treatment, this being restricted
mainly to pretreatment of industrial wastes, or through septic tanks from which the effluents
are discharged into nearby waterways. Low collection and treatment levels result in
substantial pollutant loads entering surrounding waterways, causing major environmental
and ecological damage to the water resources, posing significant health risks, and restricting
economic growth. The river system tides drive pollutants upstream as far as Shanghai's
drinking water treatment plant intakes, and this has required large investments to relocate
these intakes to safer areas, considerably increased water treatment costs, and given rise to a
high and costly risk of emergency shutdowns.



- 2 -
4.    As living standards rise, the 50 percent of Shanghai's citizens who currently rely on
nightsoil buckets (emptied daily to holding tanks) for indoor sanitation and shared yard taps
are relocating to housing with flush toilets, and indoor taps that enable the use of washing
machines and other modem conveniences. Domestic sources of pollutants would therefore
steadily increase over the next few years, further overloading wastewater facilities. The
proposed project would aim to put in place strategies and mechanisms to address the urban
environrmental management problems highlighted above.
5.    Shanghai's Wastewater Management Strategy. In the mid-1980s, both the State
and the Shanghai Municipal Government (SMG) recognized Shanghai's serious backlog in
the provision of basic and essential urban environmental services and the long-term
economic and environmental damage that this would cause to Eastern China. Ultimately,
these deficiencies would increase the cost of achieving sustainable development. The
various government levels therefore began to identify strategies for city wastewater and for
environmental protection of the whole East China area. SMG completed and adopted a
study in 1986 identifying an optimal wastewater management strategy for the city,
comprising a phased investment program supporting the construction of combined
wastewater collection systems with treatment phased in over time, managed by a financially
sustainable urban wastewater utility that would charge for services.
6.    SMG commenced its medium-term wastewater investment program with World
Bank Group support. The FY87 Shanghai Sewerage Projecf-SSPI-(Credit 1779-CHA
and Loan 2794-CHA) supported the program's first phase (Phase I), serving the northern
part of the city. The Shanghai Sewerage Company (SSC) was established through that first
project as an autonomous public enterprise under the Municipal Government, to manage
part of Shanghai's wastewater systems, and wastewater tariffs were introduced.
Construction of these systems is now substantially, complete, with the new system currently
handling an average dry-weather flow of 1.2 Mm /day. The program's second phase (Phase
II), serving the southern part of the city, would be supported in part under this proposed
Second Shanghai Sewerage Project (SSPII), which would also consolidate and extend the
institutional development and policy objectives of the first project.
7.    Complementing these initiatives are: (a) a water quality protection program being
supported under the recently approved Shanghai Environment Project (SEP, Loan 3711-
CHA), which supports investments in water supply (through the Shanghai Municipal
Waterworks Company) and related environmental management; (b) the ongoing,
Japanese Government-assisted Hangzhou Bay Study, which is formulating an
environmental management strategy for the Hangzhou Bay, the most heavily polluted
receiving water body in Eastern China; and (c) institutional development measures
including wastewater tariff enhancements, organizational and management upgrading
initiatives and selective reduction of point source pollution, undertaken to support the
program. As a major step in strengthening institutional and sector management capacity,
SMG formed the Shanghai Municipal Sewerage Company, Ltd. (SMSC), merging SSC
and related bureaus to form a major autonomous public enterprise with enlarged



wastewater management responsibilities, which would undertake all aspects of
wastewater services provision for Shanghai.
8.    Phase I of the Shanghai Wastewater Strategy was designed to remove about
20 percent of the total urban pollution load in the Huangpu River, leaving about 70 percent
of the pollution load and approximately 2.8 Mm3/day of dry-weather flow discharging
directly to surface waters. Phase II would, with the assistance of the proposed project, aim
to collect parts of these pollution loads, contributing to a significant reduction in pollution
of the lower Huangpu and the long-run protection of Shanghai's principal drinking water
resources. The project would facilitate collection of wastewater flows from an area
covering some 240 km2 in the rapidly developing Pudong and Puxi areas of the city. It
would have an initial capacity of 1.7 Mm3/day of dry-weather flow and be sized to capture
projected flows of 5.0 Mm3/day for the year 2020; the system would also collect wastewater
flows from the first stage of the Wujing/Minhang conveyor system funded under SEP,
discharging at a point with sufficient assimilative capacity for the flows and pollution loads
expected to occur during the next two decades.
9.    Approximately two thirds of the wastewater collected receives some form of
treatment. The Phase I conveyor discharges to the Changjiang (Yangtze) River at Zhuyuan,
where the assimilative capacity ensures no adverse effect to downstream users. Phase II
flows would discharge into the Changjiang through a submerged outfall 20 km downstream
of Zhuyuan at Bailonggang where the freshwater/saltwater interface and high-turbidity
mixing zone occurs, some 25 km downstream of the point where the Huangpu enters the
Changjiang.  Extensive modeling of the Bailonggang area has confirmed that the
Changjiang has considerable assimilative capacity at this point, and that the environmental
impact of these discharges at Bailonggang and in the adjacent Hangzhou Bay would be
acceptable. SMG has also allocated land for the future construction of a chemically-assisted
primary wastewater treatment plant, with an initial treatment capacity of about 0.8 Mm3/
day. Engineering studies for the treatment plant for Phase II flows are underway, ensuring
that the plant could be constructed in stages as pollution loads and flows increase over time
(commencing in about the year 2000). The environmental objective would be to ensure that
phosphorus levels discharged do not reach levels that would cause eutrophication in the
vicinity, and that dissolved oxygen levels are such as not to endanger marine life; the
discharge studies found these criteria to be acceptable. This phased strategy is also the
least-cost approach to environmental management.
10.   Institutional Strategies. SMSC would implement the project. The first project
(Phase I) assisted the then SSC in beginning to organize sector operations, commencing
development of appropriate financial and management policies, and introducing limited
wastewater charges. The charges aim to provide sufficient revenues to cover operating and
maintenance expenses, and the greater of either debt service or depreciation. Revenues
from tariffs currently meet operating and maintenance expenses (excluding depreciation);
however, to meet stormwater drainage and all debt service costs, SMG allocated
construction taxes and public utility levies (principally on water supply) to SSC to ensure
financial viability. These allocations were just sufficient to sustain the financial viability of



L611111 arCa. flVIlT comnlIeTel Snli StlfnntlPl A
-4-
SSC during Phase I. The implementation of wastewater tariff increases has been shown to
require considerable time and widespread consultations in order for SMG to build
community support for enhancements. However, SMG has confirned that it would ensure
the long-term financial sustainability of wastewater service provision; further, SMG
approved a 100 percent increase in average wastewater tariffs in July 1995, just prior to
project appraisal, which are scheduled for implementation from March 1996.
11.  In addition, the pace of institution strengthening and implementing contemporary
operational work and business practices in SSC has been slower, and more difficult than
both the Bank and SMG had estimated when preparing SSPI. The newly-created SMSC
must continue to develop its capacity if it is to effectively manage the very large wastewater
utility enterprise that would be required to operate and maintain the assets, and sustain the
services that would be financed under the project. The proposed project would build on the
initial institutional development efforts through supporting the reorganization of SMSC,
enabling it to meet increased demands in connection with new government accounting
requirements, enhancing management accounting and customer data base recording,
improved billing and collection including joint billing with the Shanghai Municipal
Waterworks Company, and advanced training in utility operations.
12.   Bank Group Assistance Strategy and Rationale for Involvement. The Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy presented to the Board on June 1, 1995 highlighted
infrastructure service level deficit alleviation and environmental protection improvement as
being two of the four identified areas of focus. The proposed project would directly support
both these objectives. Specifically the project would support the infrastructure development
and environmental management priorities emphasized in the recent Bank sector study,
China: Urban Environmental Service Management (Report 13073-CHA), which identified
completion of urban wastewater networks and the introduction of appropriate wastewater
tariffs as the next key steps in water pollution control. The proposed project, the third in a
series targeted towards improved water resource protection in Shanghai, would enable SMG
to complete a major portion of its wastewater management program. On completion of the
proposed and ongoing Bank-assisted projects in Shanghai, the following main outcomes
would be achieved: (a) economically sustainable and financially viable wastewater and
water supply pricing policies and institutions would be in place; (b) Shanghai's long-term
wastewater management strategy would be operational, and the principal components for
providing essential and affordable water and wastewater services would be functional; and
(c) a strategy would be under implementation for arresting environmental degradation of the
Huangpu River, and the surrounding watercourses, enabling regional economic growth
consistent with the vision of the Shanghai Government.
13.   The Bank's assistance to Shanghai in addressing these problems is particularly
important because of Shanghai's role as a leader in urban environmental management and
protection throughout China. Shanghai's environmental problems typify those in Chinese
metropolises, and the city is a development model for other Chinese urban areas.
Successful completion of the wastewater system would give impetus to that aspect of our
sector policy dialogue, a crucial element of which seeks adequate pricing for urban services,



- 5 -
supported by a willingness to ensure connection to the new systems. Though a difficult
issue for SMG, positive response to the pricing issue in the water sector (a 30 percent water
tariff increase was implemented through SEP) signals willingness to deal effectively with
this challenge. The agreed implementation from March 1996 of average wastewater tariff
increases of 100 percent support this further. Higher effluent discharge fees would further
moderate water demand and hence sewage flows, increase revenue, and enable more
efficient urban services management. Success in increasing wastewater service charges in
Shanghai would promote Bank and government efforts to introduce this practice in other
cities; Bank strategy provides for replication of these objectives in projects inland (the
recently approved Hubei Urban Environmental Project-Loan 3966/Credit 2799-CHA) and
planned for poorer provinces (Guangxi and Yunnan).
14.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Group Assistance.  Three principal
lessons learned have been incorporated into the present project. These lessons relate to: the
provision and management of urban environmental services; effective environmental
management and pollution control; and project preparation and implementation.
(a)   Provision and Management of Urban Environmental Services. The
review by the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department of Bank-supported
water and wastewater projects (Water Supply and Sanitation Projects: The
Bank Experience 1967-1989) concluded that to meet borrower and Bank
development objectives, project design should incorporate institution
building, financial viability, and poverty alleviation as core conceptual
elements. Bank municipal management sector work in connection with
incentives for urban service delivery emphasizes the need to properly assign
functional responsibilities and link revenues to expenditures. In China,
environmental services are provided at the municipal level, where a high
percentage of government revenue is also captured. Recent sector work
(China: Urban Environmental Service Management, Report 13073-CHA)
concluded that the major failing in environmental services has been
dependence on municipal budget transfers to fund services, while greater
reliance on user charges would be affordable, induce resource conservation,
and create a more dependable income stream. To address the issues
highlighted above, in the proposed project our dialogue has focused on the
challenges of financial sustainability (including tariff enhancement) and
institutional management issues.
(b)   Effective  Environmental Management  and  Pollution  Control.
Reviewing recent Bank experience in pollution control, including projects in
China, Asia, Latin America and Africa, has highlighted the importance of
facilitating the means for all polluters to connect to wastewater systems,
thereby expanding system coverage and the numbers of paying consumers,
and ensuring the cost-effective capture of all polluting wastewaters. The
project design draws on these lessons and those in two recent sector studies
(Environmental Strategy Paper, Report 9669-CHA, and the report on urban



- 6 -
environmental services). The latter stresses issues of political commitment,
especially with respect to pricing matters, appropriate environmental
standards and management incentives, and monitoring and enforcement
capabilities. The ongoing Bank-supported Shanghai Environment Project
(Loan 3711 -CHA) begins to address these challenges. This project would
address them further through time-bound Action Plans to: (i) enhance
capturing wastewater flows through system connections while promoting
linkages to community awareness to water conservation; and (ii) strengthen
wastewater utility operations and management.
(c)   Project Preparation and Implementation. The ongoing support from
international and Chinese expertise, with a focus on strong project
management backed by high-level political commitment to project goals,
has proved effective, and would be repeated for project implementation.
The extensive involvement of the local design bureaus during preparation is
also expected to ensure a high degree of borrower ownership. The
importance of sustained technical assistance for the challenging engineering
works during project implementation was demonstrated in the first
Sewerage Project where, for example, technical problems encountered
during construction caused flooding and loss of one of two outfall tunnels.
This underscores the need for the proposed project to support technical
assistance expertise in the areas of construction management. financial and
institutional systems development, and a technical review panel.
15.   Project Objectives. The principal project objective would be to provide a safe
environmental setting for the long-term growth of Shanghai, enabling sustained economic
and industrial growth. Specific objectives of the project are to: (a) enhance wastewater and
stormwater management through expanding wastewater collection, pretreatment and
disposal capacity and stormwater drainage facilities; (b) reduce urban pollution impact,
while facilitating pollution control; (c) improve wastewater utility financial and operational
management; and (d) strengthen sector institutions through training, feasibility studies, and
future investment project preparation in the environment area.
16.   Project Description.  The project would comprise (a) financial and policy
initiatives, planning, institutional and management reforms, supported by (b) an investment
program of environmentally-oriented capital works and institutional measures to support
management and operational capacity-building of the Shanghai Municipal Sewerage
Company, Ltd. The investment program would comprise the following components:
(a) Sewerage and Sanitation Improvements comprising trunk conveyor and secondary
sewers, and pumping facilities, with a supporting program of wastewater flow management
and connection and collection for domestic, industrial and enterprise systems, and
enhancements to stormwater drainage, nightsoil and septic tank systems management;
(b) Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems at Bailonggang comprising pretreatment,
effluent pumping facilities and a marine outfall with a flow capacity of about 1.7 Mm3/d,
and rehabilitation of existing sewerage systems; and (c) Institutional Development and



-7-
Training for supporting and strengthening project management, wastewater organizational,
financial and urban utility operations and management systems; wastewater system
rehabilitation, monitoring technology and data management; wastewater pollution control;
and training, feasibility studies and future project preparation.
17.   The institutional, financial, utility and environmental management policy initiatives
would focus on action plans for: (a) institutional strengthening of SMSC including steps
towards improving operational efficiency, resource mobilization and cost recovery; and
(b) control of industrial and domestic wastewater discharges for environmental protection
and safeguarding the SMSC assets.
18.   Project Costs and Financing. The total project cost is estimated to be $633.3
million (excluding interest during construction), with a foreign exchange component of
$200.2 million (32 percent); financing would comprise $250 million from the Bank
(39 percent of project costs or about 37 percent of total financing required) and the balance
from the Shanghai Municipality. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map (IBRD 27376) is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, Report
No. 14973-CHA, dated February 21, 1996, is being distributed separately. To assist the
early start expected to be made by SMG on some works, it is recommended that retroactive
financing of up to $5.0 million be provided for expenditures incurred from August 1, 1995,
covering initial civil works, goods and services contracts.
19.   China is eligible for single currency loans under the Bank's expanded program. The
Government of China and SM have selected LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loan
terms for the project in order to facilitate management of the foreign exchange risk of their
borrowings, by more closely matching the currency of their liabilities with that of their net
trade flows, about 75 percent of which are US dollar denominated. The Government
selected the LIBOR-based product in order to preserve the full maturity of the loan,
compared to the fixed rate option that would have resulted in a 15-year term, and judges
that it can manage the interest rate risk. This loan represents about 8 percent of the fiscal
year 1996 IBRD expected lending to China, and is well within the 50 percent volume
guideline approved by the Board.
20.   Project Implementation. SMG has appointed a Leading Group headed by a
Deputy Mayor, with members from the concerned commissions, departments and bureaus,
to direct the preparation and execution of all major urban projects in Shanghai. SMSC is
responsible for wastewater management in Shanghai, and has formulated the proposed
policies and investment program, and completed financial, institutional and engineering
design studies. SMSC would implement and manage the project, with appropriate direction
from the SMG Leading Group. Environmental oversight would be provided by the
Shanghai Environmental Protection Bureau. A comprehensive review of this work was
undertaken during preparation, supported by detailed feasibility studies of the existing and



- 8 -
projected wastewater needs, in order to prioritize the identified investments, and complete
detailed project preparation actions to a suitable level. Project design and implementation
has drawn on the lessons learned jointly from other Bank-supported operations in the region
(see para. 14 above). The Norwegian, French, Danish and Canadian Governments have
provided technical expertise and financial support to supplement SMG resources, and assist
SMSC in project preparation. The project would be carried out over a period of about six
years.
21.   Sustainability. The revenue and service charge enhancements proposed under the
project, together with the investments to improve the quality of the urban environment and
reduce the risks of contamination of the potable water supply of Shanghai would provide a
framework for the sustained delivery of urban wastewater management services. SMG
financial policy for urban utilities requires that tariffs and service charges recover costs, and
aims to phase in over time a contribution to future investments. The incremental operations
and maintenance costs would be recovered through increased tariffs and charges, and
streamlining existing revenue collection arrangements as part of the project.
22.   Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreements were reached regarding
onlending and project organizational requirements, and assurances obtained that:
(a) resettlement would be carried out in a manner and according to a schedule satisfactory to
the Bank, and in accordance with a time-bound Action Plan; (b) SMSC would adjust its
wastewater tariffs as necessary to (i) generate revenues from its wastewater operations
commencing in fiscal year 1997, sufficient to cover its operating and maintenance costs
(before depreciation), increases in working capital, debt service requirements, and the
following percentages of its three years' average capital expenditures: 5 percent in 1997
through 2000, and 10 percent thereafter; and (ii) have a debt service coverage of at least 1.3
times; (c) wastewater treatment facilities to remove phosphorus, limiting Shanghai's total
phosphorus discharge to 18 tons per day, would be constructed and operational at
Bailonggang on the Changjiang not later than January 2005; and (d) time-bound Action
Plans would be implemented through SMG for (i) institutional development and training in
SMSC; and (ii) enhancing wastewater connections including connecting existing septic tank
and nightsoil facilities to the city and county sewerage systems, and related water
conservation and public information measures.
23.   The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to the Bank between the
Shanghai Municipality and SMSC, and the implementation of the agreed increased
wastewater tariffs, are conditions of loan effectiveness.
24.   Environmental Aspects. The project is a Category A. SMSC, through its
consultants, has prepared a detailed Environmental Assessment (EA) in accordance with
Bank requirements. This has been extensively reviewed within China, and was approved
by China's National Environmental Protection Agency. The EA incorporates assessment of
possible impacts on local water and land, and on environmental quality in the Changjiang
estuary. The EA concludes that the project would have a positive environmental impact.
Detailed mathematical computer modeling studies have determined the optimal discharge



- 9 -
location, the assimilative capacity of the Changjiang at the proposed outfall location, and
the wastewater treatment strategy and phasing requirements. Phosphorus loads that could
cause eutrophication in the Changjiang and red tides in the East China Sea are of particular
concern.  These studies concluded that, initially, pretreatment would be required;
chemically-assisted primary treatment would be phased in over time as flows and
phosphorus loads build up, aiming to keep the average total phosphorus discharges from
Shanghai as a whole to less than 18 tons per day (this is expected to occur in about the year
2000, after which time chemically-assisted primary treatment would be commissioned). At
that time, considerable quantities of sludge would be generated; feasibility studies for the
future treatment requirements and plans for sludge disposal have been undertaken, and
preliminary design of the future treatment plant has been completed.
25.   Resettlement. The Shanghai authorities have in place responsive practices and
procedures for land acquisition and resettlement, and have a proven track record for their
effective implementation. Substantial efforts have been made during project preparation to
minimize the extent of the land acquisition and/or resettlement required. Most project
facilities would be constructed along existing urban service alignments, thereby minimizing
disruption. Some 7,426 persons would be affected due to land acquisition and relocation,
resulting in resettlement costs representing about 25 percent of project costs. This is
substantial, primarily due to the high unit costs of urban land, and levels of resettlement
compensation. Some 188 hectares of land would need to be permanently acquired, and 114
hectares would need to be temporarily leased during construction. An estimated 4,924
persons would be affected by land acquisition, and about 4,018 would need house
relocation; of these, some 1,516 would be affected by both land acquisition and
resettlement. Nonagriculture-based employment would need to be provided for some 2,814
persons. Of these, 2,143 would be provided new jobs and 671 would be eligible for old-age
pensions and special rehabilitation measures. The project would also affect 173 enterprises
(including shops and small businesses), out of which 21 would be relocated to new sites. A
comprehensive Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) describing the framework for resettlement
implementation has been prepared by SMG, reviewed by the Bank, and found to be
acceptable. SMSC would implement the RAP, with support from the local level.
26.   Project Benefits. The provision of a safe wastewater disposal facility for Shanghai
is a prerequisite for the sustained economic growth and public health of the eastern
Changjiang river basin and adjacent hinterland, since the latter is a center of trade
contributing significantly to the economy and development of China. The project would
enhance the Government's efforts to reform the economy, through the implementation of
fiscally rational charges for the management of urban wastewater services. Studies have
indicated that environmental degradation in Shanghai, principally in terms of water
pollution and development delay costs incurred due to inadequate urban services, is already
causing substantial economic losses (in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars
annually). Failure to control water pollution would exacerbate these losses.
27.   The project is expected to improve water quality in the Huangpu, as a result of
diversion of wastewater discharges away from the catchment, at least from Class V



- 10-
(suitable for industrial cooling water and irrigation use) to Class IV (suitable for industrial
water supply, boating and fishing use-the long-term water quality goal) and possibly to
Class III (suitable as a drinking water source after treatment). This would lessen the risk of
contamination of water abstracted from the Huangpu for potable supply, and reduce the cost
of water treatment. Improved water quality is also expected in the area of existing
discharges to the Changjiang as these are intercepted and discharged offshore. The
project's institutional strengthening in wastewater monitoring and development of systems
for the increased collection of wastewater discharges to sewerage systems would reduce the
discharge of toxic chemicals to the water environment. Economic analysis has been based
on least-cost analysis of options. A comprehensive set of monitoring indicators addressing
resettlement, finance, institutional development and environmental impact were agreed
during negotiations.
28.   Risks. The main project risks are the following: (a) delays by SMG in regularly
adjusting tariffs and service charges, due to the concerns of the city and central authorities
with respect to (i) inflation, (ii) sensitivity to negative consumer response to utility price
increases and (iii) consumer affordability of financially-priced service charges. Bank
experience to date in Shanghai confirms the ability and willingness of SMG to take action
in this connection, while proceeding with extreme caution, aiming to minimize political risk
and avoid disrupting consumer opinion. This commitment has been confirmed by the
agreed implementation from March 1996 of 100 percent wastewater tariff increases and by
the formation of SMSC as an autonomous state-owned enterprise with broad sector
responsibilities, incorporating the two previous wastewater sector operational entities;
(b) encountering construction difficulties at the proposed outfall site at Bailonggang, due to
unstable ground conditions. This risk would be responded to in part by ensuring rigorous
engineering standards, and the appointment of a technical review panel; and (c) possible
delays by SMG in implementing the institutional development and training components.
Project formulation and design have been structured to minimize these risks, and to
maintain a focus on the overall policy framework of effective cost recovery, and promoting
efficient urban utility management. The risks have been discussed in detail with SMG, and
would form the core of our dialogue with Shanghai during project implementation and
supervision.
29.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
