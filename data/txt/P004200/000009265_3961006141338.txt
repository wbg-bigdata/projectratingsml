NENORANDUM AND RECffMNDaTZON OF TAB PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA
TO 2E EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC RUBLIC
FOR A HEALTH SYSTEM REFO  AND MALARIA CONTROL PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed development credit to Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR)
for SDR 12.9 (US$19.2 million equivalent) to help finance a Health System Reform
and Malaria Control Project. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms,
with a maturity of 40 years and a ten year grace period.
2.        Countrv/Sector  Backaround.  Lao  PDR  is  an  ethnically  diverse,
agricultural country with a population of 4.2 million (1991) growing at a rapid
2.6% per year. Its per capita incom, of about US$230 ranks it as the twelfth
poorest country in the world, with correspondingly poor health conditions. Lao
PDR has high crude death and birth rates (16 and 42 per 1,000 population,
respectively), high fertility (6.8 children per woman of reproductive age), high
maternal, infant and under 5 mortality (656, 106 and 156 respectively) and low
life expectancy at birth (50 years). About 44 percent of the population is below
the age of 15, and childhood and other communicable disease levels are high.
Malaria is endemic throughout the country, and causes one fourth of all deaths
at all ages.   Access to basic health services, including family planning,
immunization and disease control efforts, is very limited.
3.        Government attention in the country's first decade of independence
after 1975 was focused on national defense and territorial security. Emphasis
shifted in the 1980e to the developmnt of more market-oriented policies in all
sectors and greater encouragement of foreign investments. For the health sector,
the Government's policy intent is to: (i) reduce mortality and morbidity from
vaccine-preventable and other communicable diseases by developing an efficient
network of basic health carr oervices accessible to allg and (ii) enhance the
resource base for public health actions. Specific actions to carry out these
policy directions include strengthening of maternal and child health services
(including family planning and immunization), ensuring adequate essential drug
supplies, training medical and paramedical personnel and promoting health through
community participation and self-help. Steps have been taken to involve the
private sector, including the legalizing of the private practice of medicine, as
well as the establishment of private pharmacies.
4.        Health care services are the responsibility of the Ministry of Health
(MOH) with actual service delivery responsibility decentralized to the 17
provinces. The health sector is seriously underfinanced and per capita health
expenditures fror domestic resources have declined from US$3.60 in 1986, to
US$0.88 in 1992. Total expenditures on health from all sources are estimated at
about US$4.0 per capita per year. The effects of underfinancing of the health
sector are most evident in the country's weak provincial and district health
systems, the absence of services at the village level, anderutilization of
district health facilities, lack or basic equipment, and shortages of medical
supplies, vaccines, and essential drugs. The productivity of health staff is
very low, training is of poor quality and not well matched with the country's
most urgent health problems, and little supervision takes place. Despite these



- 2 -
barriers, access to some preventive services such as malaria control and
immunizations has improved somewhat in recent years in response to Government
initiatives supported by donor assistance.
5.        Major health issues facing the country can be summarized as follows:
(i) high-levels of morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable and other
communicable diseases; (ii) inadequate levels of health sector financing; (iii)
lack of basic preventive and curative care; (iv) weak institutional capacity at
national, provincial and district levels; and (v) inadequately trained and poorly
performing health personnel.
6.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project supports the Government's
goals of poverty alleviation and sustainable growth. The project aims to improve
the health status of the Lao population, and to reduce morbidity and mortality
rates in selected parts o. the country. The project is designed to focus on the
most vulnerable members of the population, especially women, infants and
chIldren. The project would support improvements in the ability of implementing
agencies to plan, finance and manage health programs.
7.        Proiect Descrigtion.    The project would  include  the  following
components:   (a) Basic Health Services in the provinces of Savannakhet and
Sekong, including (i) rehabilitating health facilities, (ii) providing medical
equipment, essential drugs, and blood banking capacity; (iii) training health
workers, (iv) technical assistance, and (v) incremental operations costs; (b)
malaria control in eight out of 17 provinces (absorptive capacity constrains
covering the whole country) through (i) improvements in individual protection,
(ii) diagnosis and prompt treatment of the disease, (iii) mosquito vector control
in endemic areas, and (iv) operations research in disease control interventions;
(c) improving health education through (i) improving the MOH capacity to produce
and evaluate health education messages, (ii) developing the information,
education and communication (IEC) network, (iii) developing program-specific
messages on maternal and child health themes, malaria control, sexually-
transmitted diseases and HIV prevention; and (d) providing technical assistance
to improve project management at central and provincial levels. The proposed
project would be implemented by two divisions of the Ministry of Health, i.e.,
the Institute of Malaria, Parasitology and Entomology (IMPE) and the Institute
for Health Education, and by the health departments of Savannakhet and Sekong
provinces.
8.        The project would also finance a pilot component to provide basic
health services to isolated minority groups in two additional geographic areas,
namely the Special Zone of Saysomboune in the provinces of Vientiane and
Xiengkhouang which is now under the direct responsibility of the central
government, and an area on the Boloven plateau in the province of Champassak.
The pilot component would be prepared during the first year of project
implementation following the same project design principles used for the
provinces of Savannakhet and Sekong. A condition of disbursement for civil works
and goods under this pilot component would be raceipt by IDA of:  (i) a
technically feasible design; (ii) a financially sustainable program; and (iii)
implementation    arrangements    which    are    in   accord   with    IDA's
resettlement/relocation, indigenous people and environmental guidelines.



-3-
9.        Proiect lmolementation. The project would be implemented over a seven
year period (199S - 2001) by the MOR and provincial health directorates of
Savannakhet and Sekong.   The central Government will be responsible for
implementing the pilot sub-component in the zones of Saysomboune and Boloven
plateau. The project implementation would be under the responsibility of a
central Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and Provincial Health Management Teams
(PUNTs).  Substantial technical assistance would also be provided to transfer
knowledge and skills to counterpart staff of the PCU and PHUTs.
10.       The Project has an estimated cost of US$24.0 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$16.4 million equivalent (68%). The proposed
Credit of SDR 12,900,000 (USS19.2 million equivalent) would finance 88 percent
of foreign costs and 63 percent of local costs. A Belgian grant of US$2 *  1  4 on
equivalent would finance the remaining 12% of foreign costs. Impleuintati i
would be over a seven year period. A breakdown of costs and tt finarcing -'lan
are  shown  in  Schedule A.   Amounts and methods of proi ,ement  =4  of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B.   A
timetable of the project processing events and the status of the Association
operations in Lao PDR are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13107-LA dated December 5, 1994 is
being distributed separately.
11.       Proiect Sustainabilitv. Sustainability in a poor country like Lao PDR
cannot be narrowly defined as the Government's ability to finance from its own
resources project activities at the end of the project period. Sustainability
would be-more correctly defined as the degree to which a project has been able
to: (i) expand the country's organizational and managerial capacity in a given
sector, reducing its dependence on external support; and (ii) mobilize additional
internal and external resources for the sector. The project includes specific
support for capacity building and for ensuring project ownership at all three
levels: national, provincial and district. Participatory and interactive health
planning methods were used to prepare the system reform actions. During a series
of workshops the provinces defined basic health care service packages to be
provided, the financing and implementation strategies, and the seVquencing of
investment activities.  Active involvement of stakeholders has resulted in
greater project ownership by Government and beneficiaries.   over the longer
term, better Government management of the macro-economy and greater recognition
of the need for increased spending on health would ultimately substitute for
external resource flows to the sector.
12.       Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Operations.  The proposed project
is the first PHN sector lending operation in Lao PDR, and reflects the sector
issues and recommended interventions of the 1990 Population, Health and Nutrition
sector review (Report No. 8181-Lao, November 30, 1990). It also takes into
account the implementation issues diagnosed by the June 1993 Country
Implementation Review mission in ten ongoing IDA projects, including: (a)
shortage of counterpart funds and slow disbursements; (b) weak procurement
administration; (c) insufficient central monitoring; (d) shortages of qualified
staff; (e) weak accounting and auditing, and (f) concerns regarding
sustainability of project investments. Two separate Policy and Human Resources
Development Fund (PHRD) grants supported elements of project preparation and the
preparation timetable was extended to accommodate their use to strengthen



-4-
implementation planning. In addition, an Institutional Development Fund grant
is now underway to provide technical assistance to Government to help accelerate
project disbursements.
13.       Rationale for IDA Involement. The fVA country assistance strategy
(CRS) for Lao PDR presented to the Board in September, 1992, highlighted the need
to support sustainable growth, and assist in human resource development, both for
poverty alleviation and to increase labor productivity.   This project is
consistent with this thrust, and would be an important component of the CAS. The
health status of the population in Lao PDR is one of the poorest in Asia. Severe
financial constraints compounded by a lack of trained health manpower and
institutional and managerial weaknesses have retarded the implementation of
policies aimed at strengthening the health sector. Donor agencies and NG4s are
assisting health improvement through a series of interventions. They include
UNICEF (immunization), UNFPA (birth spacing), WHO (technical assistance and
train ng) and ADS (drug supply and expansion of primary health care).
14.       The proposed project irovides the opportunity to use IDA's comparative
advantage of addressing health sector strategy needs in the wider context of a
multisectoral policy dialogue with Government. IDA's participation would help
to sharpen the definition of sectoral priorities and to introduce relevant
experience from neighboring countries. It would build on the sector work carried
out by IDA and broaden the scope of external assistance to the health sector.
The project would also provide the opportunity to give direct assistance to women
and children, which are particularly vulnerable groups in Lao PDR. Furthermore,
the project is designed to have a long-term impact on improving health financing
and sector management.
15.       Aareed Actions. During negotiations, the Government agreed thats (a)
a fully staffed Project Coordina*ion Unit would be maintained until the
completion of the project; (b) budgets for health would include annual
allocations to finance the non-IDA share of incremental project recurrent costs
and required counterpart funds; (c) Savannakhet and Sekong provinces would
establish Project Steering Committees and Technical Support groups for managing
their part of the project and revenues from the sale of drugs would be retained
at the point of collection to assure a regular supply of essential drugsl (d) the
NOH would establish two regional malaria control centers, a Central
Implementation Team and Provincial Implementation Teams in each participating
project province; (e)- credit proceeds would be made available to Savannakhet and
Sekong provinces on a timely basis and on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Association; (f) technical assistance for project implementation would be
approved and executed as planned and budgeted; and (g) annual and mid-term
project reviews would be conducted in accordance with established schedules. The
Government also agreed that, as a condition of Credit effectiveness, it would
submit to IDA a Project Performance Indicator Plan and would establish a Project
Coordination Unit for the overall supervision and coordination of project
implementation. Satisfactory preparation of the pilot component according to
pre-determined criteria would be a condition of disbursement for that component.
It was also agreed that if the Belgian grant co-financing for the technical
assistance is not in effect by June 30, 1995, this would constitute an event of
Credit suspension.
16.       poertX Categorv.  Lao PDR is ranked as the world's twelfth poorest
country (US$230 in 1992).  By providing basic health services the project



addresses a key element of poverty alleviation. A major cause of morbidity and
mortality in Lao PDR is malaria, which dLsproportionately affects the poor.  In
addition, the pilot xones have a large population of ethnic mlnorities, who are
among the poorest in the country.
17.       Envlronmental Asoects.  The proposed project would not result in any
negative environmental impact. DDT for malaria control would be used only to
reduce the density of mosquito vectors during epidemic outhreaks. Amounts and
concentrations that will be used do not pose a public health risk. Project
activities will not result $n the involuntary resettlement or displacement of any
persons.  In the case of the pilot component, should there be any need for
resettlement, the Government has provided assurances that thil would be done in
accord with IDA's resettlement/relocation and indigenous people guidelines.
18.       Proaram Obiective Cateaories.   The project would  increase the
resources available to a severely underfinanced health sector, both through IDA
support and more effective use of local resources. Increased financing would
ameliorate the health and productivity of the targeted population, by reducing
morbidity and mortality, and by making basic clinical services accessible. The
project would help Lao women, whose frequent and closely-spaced pregnancies
result in extremely high mortality and disability levels. The project would
increase accessibility to obstetric care services and promote birth spacing
through expanded contraceptive supply and family planning services to meet
demand. The project would also provide health educatLon to increase women's
knowledge of beneficial health behavior and would encourage greater use of
maternal and child health services.
,9.       Particinatorv  Anoroach.   IDA  worked  closely with  the  central
provincial and district health staff in designing and plannLng a model of basic
health services. Likewise, the preparation of the Malaria Control Component
(MCC) was a joint effort between local and central staff of the National Malaria
control Program and IDA mlssions. The MCC also includes the participation ; 
about 900 volunteer workers who will form the cornerstone of malaria control
activitles at the community level.
20.       Proiect Benefits. Reforms in financing and delivering primary health
care would improve access to baelc health services for the population of 16
districts in two provinces (one sixth of the country's populatlon), enhance
provincial and dietrict capacity to plan and manage health services, and improve
the efficlency and the effectiveness of health workers. Stronger institutional
capacity and better trained workers would help reduce high infant, chlld and
maternal mortality rates and the related high fertility rates. About 60% of the
population would bene^lt from a reduction in dLsease and death due to malarla,
and this reductlon would increase labor force productivity. The introductlon of
user fees for selected health services would enhance government revenues,-thus
making pogsible improvements in the scope, quality and range of health services.
Targeted health educatLon messages would seek to influence health behavior at the
community and household levels.
21.       Biska.   The country's fragile institutional capacity may delay
implementation, especially in the areas of procurement, accounting and auditing
systems. Very low levels of health sector financing may cause shortages of
counterpart funds, difficulties in motivating and rewarding qualified staff, and
may impede long-term project sustainability. A number of actions have already



-6-
been taken and others are planned to counter these risks.   First, project
preparation has involved the decision makers in order to increase project
ownership.   Second, technical assistance and training account for about 20
percent of total project cost, and will be supported by grant co-financing from
the Government of Belgium.  Third, a Project Coordination Unit, assisted by
expatriate technical assistance, would be set up, and initial training for
project staff in procurement, accounting, disbursement and auditing procedures
would occur prior to project effectiveness. Fourth, IDA and its co-financing
partner would finance 90% of total project cost, including a substantial share
of  incremental  recurrent  costs.    Long-term  financial  and  Institutional
sustainability of project benefits would depend on improvements in the country's
macro-economic development and on the continued economic development of project
areas; this develapment would permit greater self-financing of recurrent costs
through contributions f'om the provinces, districts and service users.
22.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed development credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
