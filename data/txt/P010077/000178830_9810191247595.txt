APPRAISAL OF
A LOAN FOR FINANCING INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT
TO BE ADMINISTERED BY
PAKISTAN INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTMENT CORPORATION
SUMMARY AND RECOtENDATIONS
Stimmary
i.        After the severe strains undergone during 1971 and 1972, reflect-
ing political events, the Pakistan economy started to recover in FY73. The
most encouraging aspect of the recent economic performance has been the
rapid growth of exports, which in FY73 amounted to $817 million, an increase
of 37% over the previous year.
ii.       Manufacturing is the second largest sector in the economy and
contributes 17% to GDP. The rupee devaluation by 131% in 1972 has enhanced
the competitiveness of export industries and the attractiveness of labor-
intensive industries. Notwithstanding the take-over by the Government of
the management of enterprises in some industrial sectors, the private sector
still controls 82% and owns 90% of total industrial assets in Pakistan.
iii.      PICTC was established in 1957 to assist private industrial enter-
prises mainly by providing medium- and long-term finance. PICIC operates
primarily, as it was intended to, in the medium- and large-scale manufactur-
ing sector, leaving the smaller projects, by arrangement, to the Industrial
Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) and other financi.al institutions opera-
ting at the provincial level. PICIC's past lending accounted for 17% of
total private investment in medium- and large-scale industry in Pakistan.
Including operations in the former East Pakistan, PICIC's cumulative ap-
provals since its inception totalled Rs 5.3 billion ($532 million equiva-
lent) for loans to 839 projects and equity investments in 155 companies.
PICIC-financed projects are estimated to have generated 147,500 additional
jobs. Exports by enterprises assisted by PICIC are estimated to amount
annually to $250 million. PICIC's financing has gone to a broad range of
clients, of which many were newcomers to industry. PICIC has made contri-
butions in promoting new industries and enterprises, notably through its
industrial sector studies. However, there is scope for PICIC to undertake
more promotional work. PICIC is considering steps to intensify its efforts
in identifying and promoting new projects.
iv.       PICIC's portfolio is highly concentrated in a few traditional
industrial sectors, in particular textile projects. PICIC's management
realizes the desirability of a wider industrial distribution, and intends
to emphasize lending to new sectors, such as the deep-sea fishing industry.
V.        PICIC remains an efficient institution.  The new Managing Director,
Mr. Osman Ali, a former Executive Director of the Bank Group, is well supported
by an experienced staff. The star)dards of its internal operations are high,



- iv -
jts project appraisal and follow-up work satisfactory, but there is room
±or improvement in its economic assessment of projects. Following discus-
sions with the Bank's staff, PICIC is irtroducing, on a selective basis,
the calculation of economic rates of returr, as a step for improving its
ecnromic work.  PICIC's staff is competent, but needs to be expanded in
anvicipatior  of an increased volume of business and to strengthen its
Appraisal, End-use and Economic Departments. PICIC has agreed to recruit
additional ;taff.
vi.       PICIC's financial position remains undertain since it retains
the liabilities, which still have to be serviced, pertaining to its projects
located in what is now Bangladesh. The corresponding assets, consisting of
foreign currency loans, rupee loans and equity investments, amounted to $80
million equivalent, or about 30% of PICIC's total assets and three times its
share capital and reserves. Clearly, it is not within the power of PICIC
itself to remove the uncertainty regarding its future debt servicing capa-
city and its creditworthiness. PICIC's financial problem, given both its
nature and its magnitude, could be resolved only with the Government's
help and in the context of Government policies in general. The Government
has provided financial assistance to PICIC and has undertaken, among other
things, to service on behalf of PICIC its foreign liabilities (amounting
to about $70 million) pertaining to projects in Bangladesh for the time
being. This undertaking offers a temporary solution but does not ensure
PICIC's long-term creditworthiness. It is expected that the Government
will eventually agree to a solution which would ensure PICIC's long-term
financial viability, in view of the importance it attaches to PICIC as a
development institution. In the meantime, from a financial point of view,
PICIC cannot be considered a creditworthy institution.
vii.      Assuming a favorable outcome regarding PICIC's foreign liabili-
ties relating to loans in Bangladesh, PICIC's financial position and pro-
fitability remains satisfactory. PICIC's accumulated reserves enabled it
to absorb the loss of its rupee investments in Bangladesh amounting to
Rs 84 million. The Government has given a general commitment to help PICIC
observe the debt/equity limit of 7:1 agreed under the previous Bank loan
agreement, by providing additional Government subordinated loans or through
other forms of financial assistance. In keeping with this, the Government
has agreed to give PICIC an additional subordinated loan of Rs 15 million.
PICIC has agreed to increase its paid-in share capital by Rs 10 million.
viii.    PICIC's uncommitted domestic currency resources as of July 1,
1973, together with prospective collections and retained earnings, should
enable it to undertake the rupee commitments it has projected. For pro-
jected foreign exchange commitments, PICIC will require additional foreign
exchange resources of $65 million in the two-year period from January 1,
1974. It hopes to raise about $11 million equivalent from Kreditanstalt
fur Wiederaufbau (KfW).  This leaves a shortfall of $54 million.  A loan



of $25 million from the Bank would meet about one-half of this, with the
balance expected to be obtained from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and
bilateral sources.
Recommendations
ix.       The Bank has made eight loans to PICIC totalling $185 million.
An additional loan to PICIC is justified on the grounds of its continuing
operational capability and the demand for imported-capital eqjxipment for in-
dustry. However, in view of the judgement regarding PICIC's creditworthiness
at this time, a loan to PTCIC should not be made.  It- is recomm-erided
that the proposed loan be made to the Government, with PICIC administering
the proceeds under arrangements acceptable to the Government, PICIC and the
Bank. This administered loan is an exceptional arrangement to enable the
Bank to resume financing Pakistan industry through PNCIC without waiting
for a definitive solution of the problem of PICIC's assets in Bangladesh.
Once this problem has been satisfactorily resolved, farther Bank lending
for industry should again follow the usual pattern of Bank loans 'to
development finance companies.
X.        The proceeds of the Bank loan to the Government would constitute
a separate fund to be administered by PICIC without any financial liability.
PICIC would have full freedom to take investment decisions in accordance with
its usual criteria, and would receive a management fee of 1.75% per annum.
The loan would have a fixed amortization schedule of 20 years includingX 0
years of grace. The foreign exchange risk on the outstanding subloans would
be assumed by sub-borrowers; that on collections awaiting repayment lo the
Bank, by the Government. The free limit is proposed to be $3 million. The
debt/equity liikt would remain unchanged at 7:1.






APPRAISAL OF
A LOAN FOR FINANCING INDUSTRIAL INVESTKNT
TO BE ADMINISTERED BY
PAKISTAN INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTMET CORPORATION
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Pakistan has requested a Bank loan to finance
industrial enterprises in Pakistan, to be administered by the Pakistan
Industrial Credit and Investment Gorporation (DICE).  A Bank loan of $25
million is-recommended.
1.02      Since 1957 the Bank has made eight loans to PICIC totalling $185
million.  The proposed loan, unlike previous Bank loans to PICIC, is pro-
posed to be made to the Government and would be administered by PICIC on
behalf of the Government under arrangements--acceptable to the Bank--which
would ensure that the financial risk would be assBumed by the Government
instead of by PICIC. A loan to the Government rather than to PICIC is
proposed because PICIC at the present time cannot be considered credit-
worthy, for it retains the liabilities pertaining to its projects located
in what is now Bangladesh.  PICIC's continuing operational capability, however,
nuakes it a suitable administrator of a Bank loan made to the Government.
The proposed loan would enable the Bank to resume financing Pakistan industry
without awaiting a definitive solution concerning the problem of PICIC's
assets in Bangladesh. It represents an exceptional device, justified by the
present special circumstances in Pakistan. When the above-mentioned problem
has been satisfactorily resolved, further Bank lending for industry should
again follow the general pattern of Bank loans to development finance compandes.
II. ECONC*C ENVIRCWET AND INDUSTIAL FINANCE I/
General
2.01      After the severe strains undergone during 1971 and 1972, reflecting
political events, the prolonged drought Which virtually halted the increase
in agricultural output, and foreign exchange shortages, the Pakistan economy
started to recover in FY732/. Agricultural and industrial prodaction during
that year increased by 3.8% and 6.0% respectively, compared with virtually
no net growth in agriculture since FY70 and a decrease in industrial produc-
tion during FY72. GDP increased by 5.8% during FY73 compared with a stagnant
growth in the previous two years. Per capita income, which showed a decline
during FY71 and FY72, is estimated to have increased by 3.8% during FY73.
1/ Reference is invited to the latest Bank Economic Report on Pakistan,
No. 74-PAK, of February 16, 1973.
2/ July 1, 1972 to June 30, 1973.



-2-
2.02      The rapid growth of exports has been the most encouraging aspect
of the recent economic performance. Exports daring FY73 amounted to $817
million, an increase of 37% over FY72; manufactured exports accounted for
62% of the total, primary comodities for 38%. This improvement was due to
the rupee devaluation (paragraph 2.08) which made Pakistan exports more
competitive in international markets; the import liberalization measures
taken at the time of devaluation which contributed to the availability of
raw materials and the recovery of output; and favorable export prices of
cotton, cotton yarn, and rice.  In mid-August 1973  Pakistan was hit by
widespread floods, which are likely to affect the economy adversely in the
short run, although the effects will not be as serious as was at first feared.
Industrial Environment
2.03      Recent perfomance.  Manufacturing is the second largest sector
of the Pakistan economy and contributes 17% to GDP. After having grown
at 10% durirg the 60's and at even higher rates in earlier years, value
added in medium- and large-scale industry (firms with more than 10 employees)
fell by 6.8% in FY72 after a small growth of 1.2% in FY71. The decline
was due to power shortages, labor troubles, increasingly tight import res-
t-I ctions, political uncertainty, and the loss of the East Pakistan market.
Devaluation and import liberalization in May 1972 and adjustment to changed
circumstances were reflected in renewed growth from the second quarter of
FY73. According to provisional estimates, the medium- and large-scale
manufacturing sector experienced a growth in production of 6.3% during
FY73.
2.o4      Structure.  Three-fourths of industrial output is estimated to
originate from medium- and large-scale industries and one-quarter from the
small-scale sector.  However, about three-fourths of the industrial labor
force is employed in small-scale establishments (less than 10 employees).
Manufacturing employs 16% of the total labor force of about 19 million.
The recent devaluation and the import liberalizatiDn (paragraph 2.08) have
reduced some of the structural distortions and should help promote labor
intensity and fuller utilization of existing capacity.
2.05      The sectoral distribution of industry emphasizes agro-based in-
dustries (textiles, sugar, edible oil, paper, leather, tobacco) Which provide
for about 60% of total industrial value added, while chemicalJs (mainly
pharmaceuticals and fertilizers) and engineering industries each account
for about 10%. Geographically, the distribution is uneven. Almost half
of industrial output is prodaced in Sind (mainly Karachi) and more than 40%
in the Panjab. The Northwest Frontier Province produces less than 10%
and Baluchistan less than 1%. The Government, through fiscal incentives
and administrative measures, is promoting the location of industries in less
developed areas. The private sector owns over 90% of total induatrial assets.
Policy Setting
2.06      Several measures have been taken by the Government since early
1972, in the fields of agrarian tenancy, labor, foreign exchange and trade,



-3-
public management of basic industries, banking and life insurance.  Those
which directly affected the manufacturing sector are described below.
2.07      Industrial planning.  The fourth Five-Year Plan (FY7l-75) has
become obsolete because of recent events, and a new five-year development
plan, under preparation, is to begin in July 1975. In the interim, Annual
Plans provide the guidelines for short-tenm indastrial development, and the
Industrial Investment Schedule (IIS) originally prepared in 1970 continues
to serve as framework for private industrial investments. It appears that
the general direction of industrial planning in Pakistan will emerge as
follows: (i) more emphasis will be placed on the optimua utilization of
existing capacity than on creation of new capacity; (ii) efforts will be
intensified to promote small-scale industries to broaden industrial owner-
ship, and to accelerate development of poor regions; (iii) engineering in-
dustries will be given high priority to relieve pressure on foreign exchange
resources and because of its employment potential; and (iv) while the public
sector will increase its relative share in basic and heavy manufacturing,
the private sector will be encouraged to play a larger role in export-oriented
industries processing indigenous raw materials.
2.08      Foreign exchange and trade policy reforms.  Effective May 1972,
the rupee was devalued by 131%1/ in relation to the dollar.  At the same
time, the export bonus system with its multiple exchange rates was abolished
and import restrictions substantially liberalized.  The devaluation has
removed some of the serious distortions in the economy. Pakistani exports
are now more competitive in international markets and incentives to produce
for the local market (especially domestic engineering goods) have also
increased. The liberalization of industrial imports has also resulted in
faller utilization of plant capacity. On the other hand, the devaluation
created the need for difficult financial adjustments and restructurirng in
a large part of Pakistan industry because of the sharp increase in the debt
service burden on foreign borrowings. This was reflected in the arrears
situation of PICIC's portfolio (paragraph 5.12).
2.09      Public management of basic industries.  In January 1972, the
Government took over management control of 31 private companies in 10 basic
industrial categories2/. (The management of foreign-controlled enterprises
and those with assets of less than Rs 10 million, was not taken over by the
Government.) These 31 companies accounted for some 8% of total Pakietan
industrial assets, 5% of industrial sales, and 6% of employuient in firms
with more than 100 workers. In these companies,shareholders were allowed
1/  In May 1972 the rupee was devalued from Rs 4.76 to Rs 11 to TS$l.
Following the devaluation of the US dollar by 10% in February 1973,
the Pakistani rupee was revalued by 10% in relation to the US dollar,
to Rs 9.9 - US$1.
2/ The 10 categories are: iron and steel, basic metals, heavy engineering,
heavy electricals, motor vehicle assembly and manufacture, tractor
plants assembly and manufacture, heavy and basic chemicals, petro-
chemicals, cement, and public utilities.



-4-
to retain shares and proprietory rights, but the Government appointed new
professional management recruited mostly from the private sector. The
overall performance of these 31 companies under the new management has
improved, reflecting in part the better economic situation. Daring the
first nine months of FY73, sales amounted to Rs 1,035 million and profits
to Rs 54 million as against sales of Rs 714 million and a loss of Rs 13
million for the same period in FY72. Adding public sector investments by
Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (paragraph 2.12), and other
Government-controlled industries to these public managed industries, it is
estimated that the Government now controls 18% of industrial assets, 10%
of industrial sales and 11% of employment in industrial enterprises with
more than 100 workers. The effect of this reform on PICICs t operations
-s discussed in paragraph 4.10.
Industrial Finance
2.10      Financial Institutions.  The principal sources of long-term finance
for industry are P101C and :DBP (Industrial Development :Bank of Pakistan).
The Government controls some 76% of IDBP's share capital and 38% of PICIC's.
In order to ensure complementarity of the two institutions, the Government
decided at the time IDBP was created that PICIC should operate primarily
in the field of medium- and large-scale manufacturing and IDBP in the field
of small- and medium-scale industry. Hence, minimum lending limits have
been set for PICIC, and maximum limits for IDBP. PICIC's minimum lending
limit per client is Rs 1.5 million equivalent for foreign exchange and
Rs 2.5 million for rupee loans (the actual average size of its loans is
Rs 7.9 million equivalent and Rs 3.3 million, respectively). IDBP's
maximum lending limit on foreign exchange is Rs 3.0 million for limited
liability companies and RB 1.0 million for others. For rupee loans, the
maximum limits are Rs 4.0 million and Rs 1.5 million, respectively. (The
actual average size of IDBP's foreign exchange loans is Rs 1.9 million
equivalent, that of rupee loans Rs 0.3 million.)
2.11      Although PICIC and IDBP can both make equity investments and under-
write public issues, their financing activities have consisted primarily
of long-term lending. Securities and capital market activities are under-
taken mainly by Investment Corporation of Pakistan (ICP), a Government-
owned institution established in 1966. ICP also operates six closed-end
mutual funds, manages individual investment accounts and provides long-term
loans to private industries. As of June 30, 1972, ICP's total assets amounted
to Rs 489 million. Operating alongside ICP is the National Investment Trust
(NIT), an open-end mutual fund owned by 12 institutional shareholders in-
cluding PICIC and IDBP. With total assets of about Rs 500 million as of
March 31, 1973, NIT is an important factor in the securities market since
it enables investors, especially small ones, to participate in industrial
finance.
2.12      A government-owned institution, Pakistan Industrial Development
Corporation (PIDOC), is in charge of establishing and managing public sector
enterprises in certain industrial sectors (notably mining), with a view
to ultimately transferring the ownership of these enterprises to private
investors. From 1966 to 1972, PIDC had established 59 projects at an esti-
mated cost of Rs 1.2 billion (PIDC's contribution was Rs 896 million). Of
these 59 projects, 40 are under the management of PIDC, and the remaining
19 in the private sector.



-5-
2.13      Twenty-five commercial banks (17 Pakistani and 8 foreign), witita
total deposits of aboat Rs 19.6 billion, provide mainly short-term working
capital to the economy although they are also permitted to provide term
financing up to a ceiling fixed by the State Bank of Pakistan (the Central
Bank) for each bank. In May 1972, a number of measures were taken to
strengthen the State Bank's control over comercial banks, and to ensure
better management.
2.14      Insurance companies participate in industrial financing as members
of underwriting consortia, and as investors in corporate securities. Life
insurance conpanies were nationalized in 1972; the objective was to facili-
tate the use of savings mobilized by insurance companies for development
financing. Insurance companies own 23.7% of PICIC's share capital.
2.15      A number of new financial institutions have been created to
assist small industries and public sector enterprises. The functions
previously performed by West Pakistan Small Industries Corpor&tion (WPSIC)
have been entrusted to the provincial Governments. Consequently, the
Governments of Putjab, Sind, and NWFP have recently established separate
financial institutions in their provinces, to assist and finance cottage
and small-scale industries. The Equity Participation Fhnd (EFF), owned by
the Government and administered by IDBP, has been reactivated after the
loss of its Dacca office where most of its activities were concentrated.
The Fund provides equity capital to medium and small enterprises with
particular attention to newcomers and entrepreneurs from backward areas.
To promote domestic engineering industries, a refinancing scheme has been
made available by the State Bank to commercial banks and financial insti-
tutions such as PICIC and IDEP. Finally, to finance public sector enter-
prises whose role in heavy industries is likely to grow, the Government
has decided to establish the National Development Finance Corporation
(NDFC). This institution will also finance the 31 coqpanies in the ten
basic industrial categories in which the management has been taken over
by the Government.
2.16      The institutional set-up for industrial finance in Pakistan appears
adeqaate. There is some overlapping between the securities market functions
of PICIC and IDEP on the one hand, and those of specialized inJtitutions
such as ICP and NIT on the other hand, but this is not necessarily an un-
healthy situation.  The decentralization, down to the provincial level,
of the operational responsibility for assisting small industry, is appro-
priate. The creation of a new institution such as NDFC was designed to
meet new requirements of the industrial sector.
2.17      Interest rates.  The interest rates applied by commercial banks
are subject to ceilings set by the State Bank; those applied by financial
institutions such as PICIC and IDBP are determined by these institutions
in consultation with the Government and the State Bank. Until August 1973,
the discount rate was 6%, with maximum commercial bank rates of 10U11%.



-6-
This represented a very low real rate, considering the rate of price increases
in Pakistan which has averaged 8% annually over the last five years. In
August 1973 the State Bank raised the discount rate from 6% to 8% as a step
to curb inflation, control credit expansion and promote savings.  Interest
rate ceilings rose by 1% to 11% for larger banks and 12% for the smaller
ones. Deposit rates have risen by about 2% and now range from 6.75% to 9%.
Although the new interest rates may prove to be still on the low side, in
the light of the prevailing inflation, their recent increases represented
an improvement in the interest rate structure and should help domestic re-
source mobilization and the development of the capital market.
III. ROIE IN THE ECONOMY
Resource Mobilization
3.01      PICIC's resourcestotalled Rs 5,139 millior at June 30, 1973.
Foreign currency resources ($451 million) accountedlfor 85% of the total
while domestic resources provided the balance of 15% or Rs 669 million.
PICIC's resource position is summarized in Annex 1.
3.02      PICIC has raised rupee resources not only from its shareholders
and the Government, but also from the domestic market. Of total rupee
resources of Rs 669 million, share capital and reserves accounted for
Rs 246 million or 37%, Government loans Rs 83 million or 122%, State Bank
loans Rs 125 million or 19%, a USAID loan Rs 30 million or 4%, and PICIC's
own debentares Rs 185 million or 28%. PICIC's rupee debentures were issued
in three series in 1971 and 1972. About 60% of these debentures were sub-
scribed by private institutions and individuals; the balance of 40% by
public institutions, most of them insurance companies. Ternms range from
five to eight years; interest rates are 7.5% on the first issue, 8.5% on
the second and 9% on the third.
3.03      PICIC's foreign exchange resources have been drawn from diversified
sources.  Oat of total foreign exchange resources of $451,5 million, eight
IBRD loans account for 41%, loans from bilateral and other international
sources for 38%, and several suppliers' credits for 20%.  The remaining 1%
comes from the portion of the share capital paid in foreign currency. Host
of the bilateral loans and suppliers' credits were made to the Government
and allocated by the Government to PICIC for relending to induBtry.
3.04      Mobilization at project level.  On average, every rupee invested
by PICIC has generated another 1.25 rupees, i.e. 45% of the total financing
in the projects is provided by PICIC. The balance has been supplied by
foreign loans and equity investments arranged by PICIC (9%), and investments
made by the sponsors (46%). As of June 30, 1973, PICIC had arranged joint
financing with foreign investors (including IFC) for 39 projects, of which
9 were in the former East Pakistan. The total financing (loans and equity)
provided by the foreign investors was Rs 1,042 million; PICIC's participation
was Rs 570 million.



-7-
Resource Allocation
3,05      Overall operations.  A summary of PICIC's operations through June 30,
1973 is given in Annexes 2 and 3. Cumulative approvals since its inception
in 1957 amounted to Rs 5,114 millionl/ for loans to 839 projects and Rs 152
million for equity investments in 153 companies, a total of Rs 5,266 million
($532 million equivalent). Cumulative disbursements for loans and equity
investments totalled Rs 4,245 million ($429 million).  PICIC's loan disbarse-
ments daring 1964-1971 accounted for 17% of total private investment in
medium- and large-scale industry (firms with more than 10 employees).
3.06      After a virtual standstill in 1971 and 1972, reflecting the un-
favorable investment climate and the lack of foreign exchange resources
(foreign credit lines amounting to $8.7 million were fro;,en by foreign
lenders in early 1972), PICIC's operations have revived in recent months.
During the first half of 1973, loan approvals amounted to Rs 139.6 million
compared with Rs 40.6 million for the whole of 1972; commitments amounted
to Rs 181.3 million compared with Rs 15.3 million for the whole of the
previous year. Disbursements have also improved during the first half of
1973, amounting to Rs 229.6 million compared to Rs 190.9 million for the
whole of 1972. This business revival was due to the improved economic
situation during the first half of 1973 and to the fact that foreign exchange
resources became available again to PICIC.
3.07      Sectoral distribution.  Annex 4 shows the sectoral distribution of
PICIC's existing portfolio of loans and equity invettments. Textile industry
predominates, accounting for 42.5% of the total; cotton textile projects
alone represent 35.0% of the total portfolio. Sugar industry accounts for
another 19.7%. The balance of the portfolio consists of paper manufacturing
(7.9%), engineering industries (6.8%), food processing (5.8%), chemicals
(4.8%), jute (3.6%), cement(2.0%), shipping (2.0%), and other indastries
(4.9%). Although jute projects accounted for 16% of total approvals (Annex 5),
the loss of East Pakistan has virtually removed these projects from PICIC's
existing portfolio, thus increasing the relative share of textiles and mgar.
PICIC's heavy exposure in textiles was to some extent inevitable; it is the
single most important industry in Pakistan, contributing 46% to employment,
25% to output, 28% to value added in the industrial sector, and 30% to the
country's total exports. PICIC s management, while it intends to continue
supporting this vital sector of industry, also realizes the desirability of
a wider industrial diversification of PICIC's portfolio.  Regarding the
textiles sector, PICIC envisages limiting from 1974 its financing to (i)
balancing projects and modernization projects of existing spinning enter-
prises and (ii) a limited amount of additional loomage. Additional spinning
capacity will not be financed by PICIC. New industries, such as deep-sea
fishing, are expected to be emphasized in the future. PICIC should be able
to attract more projects in the non-traditional sectors by being more pro-
motional.  This is discussed under paragraph 3.16.
1/ Foreign amounts are converted into rupees at the current exchange rate
of US$1 - Rs 9.9.



-8-
3.08      Local currency and import financing.  Rapee financing (lbans and
equity investments) has represented only 10% of total financing in the past,
although this proportion has increased to 20% for the period since 1970.
The reasons for the relatively low proportion of domestic currency financing
by PICIC are: (i) the availability of locally produced capital equipment
was limited; (ii) PICIC has financed relatively large projects whose sponsors
have been usually able to put up the required domestic capital; (iii) rupee
funds for relatively large companies were and remain easily available from
commercial banks; and (iv) until recent years, PICIC was not able to mobilize
enough domestic currency resources needed for significantly higher rupee
investments.
3.09      Size of loans.  The average size of PICIC's loans since its incep-
tion is relatively large, amounting to $616,000 equivalent, reflecting the
fact that, as a matter of Government policy, and to ensure complementarity
with other financial institutions in Pakistan (paragraph 2.10), PICIC was
intended to operate in the medium- and large-scale sectors of industry.
It would not serve any useful purpose for PICIC to assist smaller industries,
because this task can be undertaken more suitably by IDBP and other institu-
tions operating at the provincial level (paragraph 2.15).
3.10      Geographical distribution.  Some 27% of loan approvals by PICIC
were for projects located in former East Pakistan. 73% for West Pakistan
(Annex 5). The distribution of West Pakistan approvals, which reflects the
geographical distribution of Pakistan industry, is as follows: Sind (45%),
Punjab (44%), NWFP (8%), Baluchistan (3%). PICIC has in recent years made
a conscious effort to assist entrepreneurs in backward areas. It is note-
'Worthy that of the 15 new projectslJ approved by PICIC in 1972-73, 8 projects
accounting for 61% of total approvals by amount, are in areas officially
defined "backward areas". To develop business in these areas, PICIC in 1972
established a regional office in Quetta and another in Peshawar (paragraph
4.05). PICIC intends to keep up its commendable efforts to assist entre-
preneurs in the country's less developed areas.
3.11      Terms of loans.  As of June 30, 1973, about 6% of the total port-
folio (by amount) had loan maturities of less than five years, 53% between
five and ten years, and 41% between 10 and 15 years. The average maturity of
PICIC's loans has been growing in recent years (58% and 84% of loan amou2ts in
1972 and the first half of 1973, respectively, had maturities of over 1O years,
Annex 5). This is explained by the increased proportion of new projects,
which usually require longer maturities than expansion projects. Annex 6
lists the rates of interests and other charges on PICIC's loans as of
October 31, 1973. Following the recent change in the interest rate etructure
in Pakistan (paragraph 2.17) PICIC has raised its lending rate on rupee
loans from 10.5% to 11.5% per annum; the lending rate on its foreign currency
loans remains unchanged at 9.5%, with the sub-borrowers assuming the foreign
exchange risk.
1/ As distinct from expansion of capacity and/or modernization projects.



-9-
3.12      Diversification of clientele..  As of June 30, 1973,PICIC had ap-
proved 839 loans, aggregating Rs 5.1 billion, to 554 clients, of which 108
were newcomers 1/ to indastry.  Of these 554 clients, 405 (or 73%) had
received only one loan and 149 (27%) had received two or more loans.  By
amounts, repeat loans accounted for 27.5% of total lending, a rather low
ratio for a development finance company which has been in operation for
sixteen years. The proportion of approvals which went to companies in which
PICIC's directors were interested was 8.7%. The bulk of approvals, 63.6%,
was for new projects, and 54.2% was for new enterprises. PIGIC's performance
in broadening the range of its clients, and assisting newcomers to industry,
has been commendable.
3.13      Underwriting and equity investments.  Notwithstanding the presence
of specialized institutions in Pakistan which engage in thess activities
(paragraph 2.11),PICIC had been active in underwriting and equity investments
until 1971, when adverse political and economic developments reduced the
scope for these operations. To date, it has underwritten 83 share issues
for a total amount of Rs 112.7 million. PICIC has also indirectly contri-
buted to the development of the securities market through its equity invest-
ments in the NIT (paragraph 2.11) and the EPF (paragraph 2.15).
3.14      PICIC's equity investments also had increased steadily until 1971,
after which they considerably slowed down due to the reasons mentioned
above. To date, PICIC has made equity investments in 155 companies total-
ling Rs 152 million. Of its equity portfolio as of June 30, 1973, 29% came
from underwriting take-ups and direct investments, 30% from the exercise
of options, and the balance of 41% from market purchases. These market
purchases did not serve any clear developmental or promotional objective,
but were conceived by PICIC as a means of earning a return on its rupee
funds awaiting term loan disbursements.  They also contributed to the ac-
tivities of the securities market. PICIC has virtually stopped these par-
chases since 1972. Annex 3 summarizes PICIC's underwriting and equity
operations.
3.15      Promotional activities.  In its early,years PICIC was instrumental
in bringing into being many projects, notably in the cement, paper and hard-
board manufacturing sectors, by identifying investment opportunities; com-
missioning feasibility studies for specific projects; seeking out entrepre-
neurs; assisting them through the project designing and structuring stages;
and having with the Government a constructive dialogue on related policy
matters. As its operations grew, PICIC's promotional work was confined
mainly to the preparation and sponsorship of industrial studies2/, several
of which have served as a basis for Government policy decisions and have
led to the establishment of new investment projects by the private sector;
market surveys3/; and arrangements for Joint financing by foreign investors
paragraph 3.047 and for foreign technical collaboration.
1/  Persons who had no previous experience in running an industry (retired
civil servants and military personnel, landlords, importers and exporters,
wholesale dealers etc.)
2/  Including studies in cement, cast iron pipe, power tiller manufacturing,
outboard engine manufacturing, bagasse pulp industry, sugar beet,
engineering capacity, etc.
3/  Including surveys on cement, paper, carpet yarn, diesel engines, etc.



-10-
3.16      There is now both scope and need for PICIC to be active once
again in promotional work. Government management of enterprises in the 10
industrial sectors (paragraph 2.09) has reduced the sectoral range of
PICIC's assistance,since PICIC intends to continue assisting principally
privately-owned and managed enterprises (paragraph 4.10).  To offset this
limiting factor, PICIC intends to do more promotional work than in recent
years, in seeking out promising investment opportunities in those sectors
that remain eligible for its assistance.  To correct the present sectoral
imbalance (paragraph 3.07) and gradually diversify its portfolio, PICIC
is beginning to undertake a concerted effort to attract or develop projects
in newer sectors, such as engineering industries and deep-sea fishing.
PICIC is aware of the desirability and need for becoming more promotional.
The steps that PICIC is studying towards this end include:
(i) the continuation and intensification of PICIC's involvement in
industrial sector studies, with a view to developing and financing
projects in these sectors. PICIC's staff is currently undertaking
comprehensive studies of the deep-sea fishing industry; pulp and
paper industry based on bagasse; processing of molasses for alcohol
manufacture; textile machinery industry; wollen spinning; and
the establishment of small units for manufacturing steel billets;
(ii) the creation of a special unit within PICIC's organization to under-
take promotional work exclusively; and
(iii)  closer cooperation between PICIC and Government agencies in charge
of industrial investment such as the Industrial Promotion Bureau,
and professional associations such as the Federation of Chambers
of Commerce and Industry, in order to identify investment projects
that could possibly be launched with PICIC's assistance.
Developmental Impact
3.17      PICI   makes both a quantitative and qualitative contribution to
the economy. The table in Annex 7 gives selected data on the 839 projects
for which PICIC had approved loans up to June 30, 1973. Disbursements by
PICIC during the period 1964-1971 accounted for 17% of total private invest-
ment in large- and medium-scale industry in Pakistan (paragraph 3.05).
PICIC's approvals amounting to Rs 5,114 million were part of a total fixed
investment of about Rs 11,700 million. On the basis of estimates contained
in PICIC's appraisal reports, the additional direct employment generated
by these projects is estimated at about 147,500. The average cost of fixed
investment per worker is about $8,000. The incremental annual sales of
PICIC-financed projects are estimated to amount to Rs 8,506 million. Ex-
ports by enterprises assisted by PICIC are estimated to amount annally to
$250 million. PICIC has also endeavored in recent years to mobilize domestic
resources from the market (paragraph 3.02). PICIC's qualitative contribu-
tions also include its promotional activities and industrial studies
(paragraph 3.15), its endeavors to assist newcomers to industry (paragraph
3.12) and entrepreneurs in the backward areas of the country (paregraph 3.10),
and, finally, the relatively broad range of its clients (paragraph 3.12).

IV. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Share Capital and Ownership
4.01      PICIC's initial paid-in share capital was Rs 20 million.  The last
increase was in September 1971, when the capital was raised by Rs 10 million
to Rs 60 million through a rights issue for cash at a premium of 50%. Follow-
ing that increase, Pakistani shareholding rose from 60% to 64%, since all but
one of the foreign shareholders, at PICIC's request, renounced their rights.
IFC's shareholding dropped from 4.0% to 3.3% of the total share capital.
As a result of the nationalization of life insurance companies (paragraph
2.14), public sector shareholding increased from 17% to 38%. Principal
shareholders are listed in Annex 8.
Organization and Staff
4.02      Board of Directors.  PICIC's Board comprises 20 directors (including
the Chairman) of whom 12 are elected by Pakistani shareholders, 5 are nomina-
ted by foreign shareholders and IFC, 2 by the Government, and the Managing
Director who is an ex-officio member (Annex 9). Of the 12 elected directors,
10 were elected in 1972 and 1973.  While most of the previous directors
were connected with leading industrial groups, the majority of new directors
have a professional background in finance, banking and related fields. The
experience represented on the Bbard has thus been broadened; the representation
of the large industrial groups has been reduced. IFC is represented on the
Board by Mr. Hanns Pichler , the Bank's Resident Representative in Pakistan.
4.03      Management.  Mr. M. Raschid, former Governor of the State Bank, was
elected ChaI-man inJuly 1972. At the same time, the chairmanship became a
salaried position, which however did not affect the executive powers of the
Managing Director. Mr. Iqbaluddin Ahmed, the Managing Director since August
1971, left PICIC in July 1973 to join the Private Development Finance Company
of Indonesia. He was succeeded by Mr. Osman Ali, a senior Government official
and former Executive Director of the Bank Group. Under the new Managing
Director, well supported by an experienced staff, PICIC remains an efficient
institution.
4.04      Staff.  Following the separation of East Pakistan in December 1971,
PICIC lost some gO professional staff in the former Dacca office and 19 pro-
fessionalB in the head office.  The loss, however, has had little impact on
PICIC's operation because of the corresponding loss of business in Bangladesh
and a slowdown of operations.  PICIC had as of June 30, 1973 a professional
staff of 92 including 10 new recruits during 1972 and 1973, and 161 other
staff. PICIC's staff organization is shown in the attached Chart. Because
of its prestige, competitive remuneration and working conditions, PICIC has
been able to attract qualified and competent staff. PICIC has no formal
training facilities for its staff but provides adequate informal on-the-job
training for new recruits and junior officers. The overall quality of the
professional staff remains high. PICIC has agreed to recruit additional
staff to undertake more promotion work, and to strengthen its Operations
(Appraisal) Department, End-Use Department and Economic Department which
are presently understaffed.



-12-
4.05      Organization. There are nine departments in the head office and
four branch offices (see Chart). Three new departments have been created
since 1969: the Project Development and Statistics Department was created
in 1970, mainly to undertake the preliminary screening of projects; a new
Investment Banking Department undertakes all work relating to investments
in shares and securities; and the Letters of Credit and Insurance Department
was separated from the End-use Department in March 1973. While PICIC lost
the Dacca Regional Office, it has opened two new kegional offices:  one in
Quetta (Baluchistan) and one in Peshawar (Northwest Frontier Province).
These are relatively small offices.
4.o6      Appraisal.  The standards of PICIC's project appraisal work are
satisfactory, especially in the analysis of the financial, marketing and
technical aspects of projects. PICIC's economic analysis is less satis-
factory, and until recently was based only on such partial indicators of
economic attractiveness as earnings and savings of foreign exchange, value
added and employment generation. However, following recant discussions with
Bank staff, PICIC is correcting this deficiency by introducing calculations of
the effective rate of protection and the economic rate of return. PICIC's
management is endeavoring to strengthen its economic staff, specifically by
recruiting an experienced industrial economisrto head itaXconomic and
Market Research Department.
4.07      Follow-up.  PICIC's follow-up procedures are well thought out.
Clients are required to subMit quarterly progress reports during the con-
struction stage, a completion report, and annual reports after the start
of operation. Data provided in these reports are checked through visits
by the supervision staff who then submit their assessment of the project's
progress and make recommendations, if necessary, on remedial action to
be taken. Problem projects are inspected more frequently, sometimes
monthly. The management is kept well informed.
4.08      Procurement and disbursement.  PICIC does not in general require
its borrowers to apply international competitive bidding. Bat it does
usually require that procurement under its foreign currency loans be
based on at least three quotations obtained from foreign suppliers, and
that the final import contract be subject to its approval. The price and
suitability of the eqaipment proposed to be purchased is subject to a care-
ful check by the staff, increasingly supplemented by comparisons on the
basis of its experience with similar projects. For this purpose, PICIC
set up in 1969 an Engineering Price Cell in the Operations Department,
which has developed a pool of information on the specifications and prices
of machinery in a wide range of industries. PICIC's procurement procedures
appear appropriate to the nature of its business. Its disbursement pro-
cedures are satisfactory.
Operating Policies
4.09      As intended by the Government and PICIC, the company has been
operating mainly in the field of medium- and large-scale manufacturing,
leaving the smaller scale sector to the Government-controlled IDBP



-13-
and other provincial institutions. To that end PICIC's Statement of Policy
(Annex 10) provides for minimum limits on its lending operations (para-
graph 2.10). PICIC also has upper limits on its commitment.  The maximax
single transaction is normally limited to $4 million equivalent; and the
total commitment in a single enterprise to the equivalent of 25% of PICIC's
equity or $5 million, whichever is the lower (presently $5 million).
4.10      PICIC's policy statement limits its assistance to enterprises
"in the private sector". The recent take-over by the Governrment of the
management of 31 private companies in 10 industrial categoriesl/ (para-
graph 2.09) has posed a problem to PICIC. Of these 31 companies, 19 are
PICIC's clients. As a matter of policy, PICIC intends to continue to direct
its assistance principally to enterprises managed as well as owned by the
private sector, but it envisages contiming to finanoe expansion and moderni-
zation projects of these 19 existing clients. To that end, PICIC iB con-
sidering amending its Policy Statement.
Relations with the Government and the Business Community
4.I1      PICIC works closely with the Government in the formu3*tion and
implementation of industrial policy. It is represented on iwportant Govern-
ment committees/boards concerned with industrial and investment matters.
As noted later (paragraph 5.05), the Government has undertaken to help
PICIC maintain its debt/equity ratio within the contractual limit agreed
with the Bank and has agreed to provide resources for servicing PFIIC's
external debt in respect of projects in Bangladesh (paragraph 5.02). Despite
this close relationship, PICIC has been able to maintain its operational
autonomy. PICIC has good relations with financial institutions. Several
banks and insurance companies are PICIC's shareholders, and are represented
on its Board. PICIC enjoys considerable prestige and influence in Govern-
ment as well a business circles.
1/ These ten sectors to date account for about 4% of PICIC's total lending.

V. FINANCIAL POSITION AND CREDITWORTHINESS
Problem of Assets and Liabilities in Bangladesh
5.01      The problemo At the time of the sece3sion of East Pakistan in
December 1971, PICIC had in East Pakistan outstanding foreign currency loans
of about $70 million, and rupee loans and equity investments of Ra 84 million,
which together represented about 30% of PICIC'  total assets and about three
times its present share capital and reserves.  On the one hand, PICIC retained
the iAabilities relating to borrowings incurred to finance its projects lo-
cated in Bangladesh, and hence had to continue servicing these liabilities.
On the other hand, PICIC has ceased to derive any income from these assets
after Decemoer 1971. Clearly, it is not within the power of PICIC itself
to remove the uncertainty regarding its future debt servicing capacity and
its creditworthiness.  PICIC's financial problem, given both its nature and
its magnitude, could be resolved only with the Government's help and within
the context of Government policies in general.  Ihe Government has been forth-
coming in its financial assistance to PICIC, and has already agreed with PICIC
or certain arrangements which are described below.
5.02      Existing arrangements. Following the secession of East Pakistan,
PICIC's cruciaI and pressing financial problem was to find the resoarces to
continue servicing its foreign liabilities pertaining to projects located in
Bangladesh. (The problem of PICIC's rupee assets in Bangladesh is discussed
separately under paragraph 5.04.) At PICIC's reqLest, the Government agreed
in December 1972 to service the above-mentioned foreign liabilities on behalf
of PICIC in terms of an Agreement with PICIC, shown as Annex 11. The Govern-
ment's undertaking, however, was subject to the caveat "for the time being
and so long as the Government continues to service external liabilities per-
tairdng to East Pakistan". It is not clear how long the arrangements under
this Agreement would last. Farther, the arrangements did not definitively
relieve PICIC of the foreign liabilities in question. In consequence, the
amounts provided by the Governuent to service PICIC's foreign liabilities
constitute a debt to the Government by PICIC. It has not been decided whether
the Government intends to require PICIC to repay the debt in dae course, and,
if so, on what terms and conditions. The Agreement nonetheless has stipulated
that PICIC shall not be required to repay the amounts advanced by the Govern-
ment until PICIC has recovered its assets in Bangladesh, or obtained compen-
sation therefor, or until all PICIC's external borrowings incurred after
November 1972 have been repaid.
5.03      While the arrangements described in the preceding paragraph do
provide a temporary solution to the problem of servicing PICIC's foreign
liabilities pertaining to assets located in Bangladesh, they fall short
of ensuring PICIC's long-term creditworthiness. It is reasonable to
assume that t e"overnment will enventually ensure PICIC's long-term



-15-
financial viability, in view of the importance it attaches to PICIC as a
development institution. In the meantime, however, PICIC cannot be con-
sidered a creditworthy institution and the Bank should not lend directly
to it.  Hence, the proposed loan would be made to the Government and
administered by PICIC without incurring financial liability (paragraph 7.01).
5.04      With respect to PICIC's rupee assets in Bangladesh amounting to
Rs 84 million, the Government was unwilling to cover this loss, or to give
PICIC some financial assistance similar to the arrangements regarding PICIC's
foreign liabilities, described in paragraph 5.02, on the grounds that PICIC's
financial position enabled it to absorb this loss., especially in view of a
profit of Rs 100.3 million (paragraph 5.07) which accrued to PICIC in 1972
following the rupee devaluation.  Ihe amount of Rs 84 million may therefore
be considtered as a loss to PICIC, and consequently it must be written off or
a provision be made to cover it. A write-off at this time is not considered
appropriate. As of June 30, 1973, only a small provision of Rs 2.75 million
has been made in PICIC's balance sheet. PICIC has agreed to make additional
provisions of Rs 81.4 million in its December 31, 1973 balance sheet, in order
to cover the full amount of Rz 8U.1 million for its rupee assets in Bangladesh.
5.05      In addition to its undertaking to service PICIC's foreign liabili-
ties pertaining to projeots in Bangladesh, the Govermsnt has given a general
conuitment to help PICIC observe the debt/equity limit of 7:l agreed under
the previous Bank loan agreement. In keeping with this comitment, the
Government has rescheduled its subordinated loan to PICIC amounting to As 82
mllion so that these loans could meet the definition of equity under the
previous Bank loan agreement. Dhe Government Ms agreed with the mission to
make PICIC an additional subordinated loan of Rs 15 million to furtherirn-
prove PICIC's debt/equity ratio (paragraph 5.08).
Financial Position
5.06      General.  In looking at PICIC's financial position, it is necessary
to bear inmindthat the status of PICIC's foreign liabilities pertaining to
Bangladesh remains uncertain (paragraph 5.03). No provisions have been made
for PICIC's foreign currency assets of $70 million located in Bangladesh, in
line with PICIC's assuittion that it will not ultimately have to bear an-y
loss on these assets.
5.07      Exchange revaluation      lus.  When the rupee was devalued in
May 1972, PFIICTi otstwdIgoregncurrency loans exceeded its foreign
currency borrowings by Rs 100.3 million, which represented a non-operational
profit to PICIC. This situation had arisen because PICIC Mt it8 foreign
debt obligations as they fell due at the pre-devaluation rate, prior to re-
ceiving repayments from its sub-borrowers. The magnitude of the above asount
was due to the large volume of overdues by PICIC's clients at the time of
the devaluation (paragraph 5.12).



-16-
5.08      Debt/Equity  ratio.  According to the figtires in PICIC's unaudited
balance sheet as of June 30, 1973, (Annex 12), the contractual debt/equity
ratio, as defined in the Bank loan agreement, was 6.0:1, excluding from
debt PICIC's foreign liabilities pertaining to Bangladesh on the assunption
(paragraph 5.06) that PICIC will not have to bear any loss relating to these
liabilities.  The June 30, 1973 figwres, however, did not take into account
an additional Rs 81.4 million provision for Bangladesh rupee assets which
PICIC has agreed to make (paragraph 5.04). If this provision were made out
of PICIC's accumulated reserves, the debt/equity ratio would becone 7.9:1,
in excess of the contractual limit of 7:1. Hence, in order to bring the
ratio back within the agreed limit, the Government and PICIC have agreed
that: (a) PICIC would increase its share capital by Rs 10 million in 1974;
and (b) the Government would give PICIC an additional subordinated loan of
Rs 15 million, following the cozrpletion of the share capital increase. This
would suffice to bring PICIC's debt/equity ratio back within the 7:l limit.
It is recoimnded that the existing contractual debt/equity limit of 7:1
remain unchanged, in view of the present uncertainty regarding PICIC's
foreign liabilities, and of the Government's commitment to help PICIC ob-
serve this debt covenant.
5.09      Profitability.  Income statements from 1969 through June 30, 1973
are given inAmex 13. Net income before provisions rose to Rs 34.3 million
in 1972, a 53% increase over the previous year,l/ mainly because of the
rupee devaluation which more than doubled the interest income on foreign
currency sub-loans.  The return on average equity remained satisfactory at
14.7% in 1971 and 16.4% in 1972. Administrative expenses remained very low
at 0.4% of average total assets in 1972. The spread on lending operations
was around 3% in the first half of 1973, which is adequate. PICIC declared
a cash dividend of 12% in 1971 and 10% in 1972. The latter represented a
dividend pay-out of 17.5%.
5.10      Liquidity position, PICIC experienced serious liquidity problems
in 1972 as a rest of a high volume of arrears (paragraph 5.12), and the
fact that PICIC had to continue servicing its debt obligations pertaining to
projects in Bangladesh. Collections from PICIC's borrowers (in West Pakistan)
amounted to Rs 120 million, or only 55% of PICIC's debt repayments. In
addition, PICIC had to put up Rs 81 million during 1972 to service foreign
liabilities relating to Bangladesh projects prior to the Government's agree-
ment to service these liabilities on behalf of PICIC (paragraph 5.02). PICIC
met this shortfall with borrowings from the State Bank (Rs 125 million) and
debenture issues (Rs 185 million).  The liquidity situation inproved oon-
siderably in 1973 because of (a) a substantial increase in the rate of debt
collections to 71% of billings in the first half of 1973 conpared with 40%
for 1972; and (b) the fact that funds for servicing Bangladesh foreign
liabilities are now provided by the Government (paragraph 5.02). The liquidity
position is now satisfactory. PICIC is expected to have a positive debt
service coverage in 1973; it was negative in 1972.
1/ Fbr conparison purposes, a Rs 10 million donation by PICIC to the National
Defense Fund during 1971 which appears as an expense in the income state-
ment was not taken into account in this couputation.



-17-
5.11      Audit.  A.F. Ferguson and Company continue to be PICIC's auditors.
Uhtil 1971, none of their audit reoorts on PICIC contained any qualification.
In their 1972 report, however, the auditors were "unable to express an
opinion on the adequacy of the provision made for doubtful accounts". This
reservation relates, not to the adequacy of the Rs 20 million provision for
doubtful accounts in (West) Pakistan, but to the absence of provisions to
cover possible losses on PICIC's assets in Bangladesh.(paragraphs 5.04 and
5.06).
Quality of Portfolio
5.12      Loans.  Annex 14 gives particulars of loans in arrears.  As of
June 30, 1973, 152 clients (out of 275) and 186 loans (out of 349) were in
arrears for more than three months.  The total principal of these loans
amounted to Rs 905 million or 49.9% of the outstanding loan portfolio.  The
table below shows the development of the arrears situation since 1971:
No. of Loans    Principal in    Principal Outstanding
in Arrears/       Arrears/           for Loans in
Total Nunber    Outstanding      Arrears/Outstanding
of Loans       Portfolio            Portfolio
June 30, 1973                 53%             7.5%                 9.9%
December 31, 1972'            67%             6.i%                63.7%
December 31, 1971             27%             1.3%                24.9%
As this table indicates, the proportion of arrears in PICIC's portfolio re-
mains very high.  This problem, however, has to be viewed in the context of
the general situation prevailing in Pakistan since December 1971 which was
characterized by an economic recession, the loss to many firms of the tradi-
tional East Pakistan market, and the rupee devaluation of May 1972 which in-
creased the debt service burden of PICICts foreign exchange borrowers by 131%
or more and created the need for difficult financial adjustments and re-
strcturings.  In spite of the high ratio of arrears, actual losses to PICIC
are likely to be small because most delinquent clients appear to have been
experiencing only temporary financial difficulties, and because PICIC's loans
are usually well secured.  As of June 30, 1973, PICIC estimated that the loss
to it would not exceed an outside amount of Rs 8 million. lb date no loans
have been written off. Provisions already made for possible losses on
PICIC's Wdest Pakistan portfolio (i.e. excluding East Pakistan assets) amount
to Rs 20 million, which represents only 1.1% of this portfolio. Total pro-
visions and reserves, however, amnunt to Rs 141 million or 7.8% of the out-
standing loan portfolio as of Jume 30, 1973.
5.13      PICIC's management is keeping a close watch on the arrears situation.
Individual accounts have been analyzed in detail and loans rescheduled where
appropriate. Fbllow-up and debt collection work has been tightened up. Some
progress has already been achieved. Debt collections in relation to arounts
due have improved from 40% in 1972 to 71% in the first half of 1973. This
inprovement is expected to continue.



-18-
5.14      Equity investments.  As of June 30, 1973, PICIC's equity portfolio
consisted ofishiares in b4  npanies, all in operation, totalling Rs 73.7
million at cost.  Of these, 49 companies representing Rs 44.4 million are
paying dividends, 9 conpanies (Rs 8.5 million) are mderately profitable but
not paying dividends, and the remaining 26 (Rs 20.8 million) are sustaining
losses. Notwithstanding the slump in the stock market (the general share
price index on the Karachi stock exchange was 85 as of June 30, 1973 versus
64 in September 1972 and 100 in 1969-70), the aggregate market value of shares
held by PICIC was Rs 82.1 million, slightly above cost. The dividend yield
on PICIC's average equity portfolio inproved slightly in the first half of
1973 to 4.75% from 4.53% in 1972 but is still below the yitJld achieved in
previous years.
VI. PROSPECTS
General Outlook
6.01      Given revival of private sector confidence along with the Govern-
.ment's pragmatic economic policies, prospects for further industrial growth
in Pakistan over the next few years are good. The recent Bank Economic
Report estimates that the econony can be expected to expand by 7% per annum
during the period through 1977, with industrial output and investment growing
at about the same rate, and that industrial exports would grow by 12% annually
for the next several years.
Business Fbrecast
6.02      Annex 15 shows the forecast of PICIC's approvalsF, commitments and
,isbursements from July 1, 1973 through 1977. Approvals for 1973 and 1974
are largely based on projects PICIC presently has in its pipeline. Approvals
of loans and investments are projected to be of the order of Rs 440 million
in 1973 and Rs 45o million in 1974, and to increase thereafter by 6% annually
to a level of Rs 535 million in 1977. The level of approvals projected for
1973 represents only about two-thirds of the annual level of approvals in
1969-70, reflecting the reduction in PICIC's geographical scope of operations
(loss of former East Pakistan), the limited opportunities for private in-
vestments in ten basic industrial sectors (paragraph 4.10), and, wre gener-
ally, PICIC's caution. Approvals of equity investments are expected to
'grow steadily from Rs 5 million in 1973 to Rs 25 million in 1977. The pro-
portion of rupee financing in relation to total financing for the projected
period will remain at about 18% despite the resumption of foreign lending,
reflecting PICI1's expectation to finance the domestic machinery industry
out of a rupee line of credit of Rs 50 million recently made available to
PTCIC by the State Bank. PICIC's projected disbursements over the period
noted above would represent about 20% of the estimated total private invest-
ment in medium- and large-scale industry in that period.



-19-
Resource Requirements
6.03     Foreign currencY. PICIC's uncommitted foreign currency resources
at June 30a, 1973, amounted to $38.7 million, but are expected to decline to
$16.5 million by the end of 1973. It expects to comnit foreign currency
loans of $43.3 nillion in 1974 and $37.9 million in 1975. For the two-year
period from January 1, 197h, PICIC would therefore require additional foreign
exchange resources of about $65 million of which it expects to obtain $10.7
million (DM 30 million) from  E  in early 1974. This leaves a shortfall of
about $54 million. A Bank loan of $25 million would meet approximately one-
half of PICIC's requirements for the two-year period 1974 and 1975, and the
balance is likely to be obtained from ADB and bilateral sources.
6.04     Domestic currenc.. PICIC's rupee commitments for the period from
July  ', 1973 to=eF19ber 1975 are estimated to be Rs 190 million. As of
June 30, 1973, PICIC had uncommitted rupee resources of Rs 176 million.
These resources together with prospective internal cash generation (Rs 107
million), draw-down on State Bank credit (Rs 50 million; paragraph 6.02), a
new Government subordinated loan (Rs 15 million), and the planned share
capital increase in 1974 ( Rs 10 million), should enable PICIC to undertake
the commitments it has projected and to maintain a satisfactory liquidity
position.
Financial Projections
6.05      The financial projections presented below are based on the assuip-
tion that the Government will continue, under the existing Agreement, to
provide PICIC with resources for servicing its foreign liabilities relating
to Bangladesh projects and that a satisfactory settlement of this problem
will be reached eventually which would not inpose any loss on PICIC (para-
graph 5.06).
6.06     Projected income statements for the period 1973-77 are shown in
Annex 16. Net profits after tax are expected to grow steadily from Rs 38.7
million in 1973 to Rs 55.9 million in 1977. The return on average net worth
will increase from 17.5% in 1973 to 19.6% in 1977. Borrowing and lending
rates are based on the rates prevailing in August 1973 and assumed to hold
throughout the 1973-77 period. Administrative expenses are forecast to in-
crease from Rs 9 million in 1973 to Rs 13 million in 1977, but will remain
below 0.6% of average total assets. Although the projected dividend rate
will increase from 12.5% for 1973 to 15% for 1976 and thereafter, the pay-out
ratio will remain around 20% through 1977. On the assunption noted in the
preceding paragraph, 'PICIC's profitability will remain satisfactory.
6.07     Projected balance sheets through 1977 are given in Annex 17.  Total
assets, which grew at an annual rate of 20% during 1967-1971, are expected to
decline slightly from Rs 2,,457 million (excluding assets in Bangladesh) in
1972 to Rs 2,312 million at the end of 1976. This absence of growth in total
assets is explained by two factors. First, the foreign currency loan port-
folio outstanding is projected to decline gradually through 1975 because



-20-
approvals and commaitments in the period 1971-72 were extremely low (paragraph
3.06). Second, the proposed Bank loan of $25 nillion to be administered by
PICIC will not constitute either PIIC's assets or liabilities becmse of the
absence of financial liability on the part of PICIC. The inp?ovement in
PICIC's projected contractual debt/equity ratio, from 7.3:1 in 1973 to
6.0:1 in 1974k, 5.5:1 in 1975, 5.9:1 in 1976 and 4.8:1 in 1977, is explained
by the same factors.
6.08     Projected cash flow statements through 1977 are shown in Annex 18.
As noted earlier (paragraph 6.05), these assume that the Government would con-
tinue to provide the resources for servicing PICIC's external debt pertaining
to Bangladesh. The debt service coverage is expected to remain slightly
above unity during the projected period, except in 1976 when it will be 0.96
times because a sizeable portion of PICIC's debentures, issued in 1972 to
meet debt service requirements, becomeedue. If actual collections exceed the
estimated collections (ratios assumed by PICIC are 70% of the amounts due in
1973, 80% in 1974s, 85% in 1975, and 90% thereafter), the debt service cover
will i1prove correspondingly.  In any event, PICIC's sizeable cash resources
(Rs 208 million) as of June 30, 1973, together with new fmuds obtained through
the proposed capital increase and the subordinated loan from the Government,
will provide an added cushion.
VII. PROPOSED LENDING SCHM
Cerieral
7.01      The proposed loan would be made to the Government. The proceeds of
the loan would constitute a separate fund to be administered by PICIC as an
agent of the Government, under a Management Agreement acceptable to the Bank.
PICIC would not assume any financial liability to the Government; financial
losses, if any, resulting from defaults by sub-borrowers, would be borne by
the Government.  PICIC would generally operate the administered_fund  as
nearly as possible in the same manner as it would utilize a Bank loan,
i.e. it would have full freedom in the selection and appraisal of projects
in accordance with its usual criteria; would fix relending terms of sub-loans
according to the requirements of the projects; and would allow review of
projects by the Bank, etc. The device of an administered loan would enable
the Bank to resume financing industry in Pakistan withoit waiting for
a definitive solution to the problem of PICICts foreign liabiliti8s
relating to projects in Bangladesh (paragraph 5.03). It is expected that the
Government will eventually agree to a solution which would ensure PICIC's
long-term creditworthiness, It would then be possible for the Bank to
resume lending to PICIC.
Main Terms and Conditions
7.02      Management fee and interest rate.  As renumeration for PICIC's
services, the Government and PICIC have agreed that PICIC will receive from
the Government a fee of 1.75% per annum calculated on the outstanding amount



-21-
of sub-loana. This appeara roaoonable, given that PICIC will not bear the
investment risk. (PICIC presently gets a spread of 2% on the use of its
foreign currency resources, while bearing the investment risk.) The re-
lending rate to sub-borrowers would be 9.5%, the same as that currently
charged by PICIC on its foreign currency sub-loans, and two points below
the rate of 11.5% charged on its rupee loans. Considering that the sub-
borrowere assume the foreign exchange risk (paragraph 7.04), the proposed
9.5% rate appears adequate.
7.03      Amortization schedule. As was the case for the previous Bank loan
to PICIC (Loan 590-PAK), there would be a fixed amortization schedule of 20
years, including three and a half years of grace.
7.04      Foreign exchange risk.  The sub-borrowers will, as has been the
case with Bank loans to PICIC, assume the foreign exchange risk on outstand-
ing sub-loans. The Government has agreed to bear the foreign exchange risk
on amounts collected from borrowers and awaiting repayment to the Bank.
7.05      Free limit.  Under the previous Bank loan to PICIC, the free limit
was $4 million with no aggregate free limit. Since PIC0C's maximum exposure
in a single enterprise is limited to $4 million equivalent under its Policy
Statement (paragraph 4.09), no PlCIC sub-project required the Bank's prior
approval. PICIC's new Managing Director has expressed a desire for the Bank
to review, for prior approval, a number of projects under the proposed loan,
so as to maintain a dialogue between the Bank and PICIC's staff on project
appraisal, particularly economic appraisal. PICIC and the Bank have there-
fore  agreed on a $3 million free limit for the loan. For this purpose, the
amount of $3 million relates not just to the amount drawn from the proposed
loan, but to total amount lent by PICIC for a project. With this free limit,
it is estimated that about 30% by amount, or 10% by number, of projects
under the loan will require the Bank's prior approval.

PAKISTAN INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTMENT CORPORATION LIMITED
Statement of Policy
Approved by the Board of Directors on December 10, 1964 and
Amended on March II,, September 30, 1967 and December 7, 1970
1.   Objectives of the Corporation
(a) To stimulate the development of the country by providing finance
for the establishment of new industries as well as for the bal-
ancing, modernisation and expansion of existing industries, all
in the private sector;
(b)   To provide finance only for projects economically viable and
financially sound; and
(c)   As far as possible, to assist in broadening the base of industrial
ownership in the country and thereby develop the Stock Market.
2.   These objectives are carried out through:-
(i)   Investment Policy
(a) Finances are made available only for viable projects which
will contribute to the economic growth of the country and to
saving or earning of foreign exchange. For this purpose all
projects are subjected to careful examination through quali-
fied staff and only those judged economically viable, techni-
cally sound and financially profitable are considered for
assistance;
(b)  Finances are made available to projects which are in line
with the development plans of the Government, preference
being given to projects largely based on local raw materials;
(c)  Financing is diversified, as far as possible, both as regards
different regions of the country and as regards different in-
dustries and their ownership. Preference is given to the fi-
nancing of projects in the under-developed areas of the 2
wings of the country as long as they satisfy the conditions
of economic viability and financial soundness;
(d)  In accordance with the normal business practice, adequate
security is obtained to cover the loans but in addition the
main considerations are soundness of management and projected
profitability of the enterprise to cover rep%jments;



ANNEX 1lo
Page 2
(e) The Corporation does not seek any controlling interest in
any enterprise financed by it but consistent with the safety
of its interests, leaves the management and control in the
hands of the entrepreneurs;
(f)  Even after providing the finance, the projects are carefully
watched and those in difficulties are assisted to the extent
possible till the loans are repaid; and
(g) Corporation does not finance working capital requirements by
means of short-term local currency loans, This buasiness is
left to the commercial banks. In other respects also PICIC
does not compete with commercial banks.
(ii)  Method of Financin
Corporation provides finance according to the suitability of
each project, in the form of:
(a) Direct loans, mostly in foreign currencies;
(b) loans partly convertible into stock;
(c) direct equity participations; and
(d) underwriting of public issues.
(iii)  Size of Loans
(a) Progressively and as desired by Government, Corporation
has raised the minimum lending limit for its operations.
These minimum lending limits, except where enterprise is
already mortgaged with PICIC for earlier loan or where
permitted by Government for special reasons., for the time
being are Rs. 0.75 million for East Pakistan and backward
regions of West Pakistan and Rs 1,50 million for the pro-
vinces of West Pakistan other than the backward regions for
foreigIn currency loans and Rs 2.5 million for riuee loans
(smaller loans are provided through other institutions in
the country).
(b) PICIC shall limit its financial assistance in any single
transaction to not more than US$4 million. PICIC shall
limit its total commitment to any single enterprise to the
equivalent of 25% of PICIC s net worth or US$5 million,
whichever is the smaller.  For the purposes of this
limitation, the term "total commitment" means the aggregate
amount of all the outstanding commnitments of PICIC in such
enterprise plus the total amount of any proposed new
commitment, both amounts to be determined as of the date
such new commitment is proposed to be made.

(iv)  Exchange Risk
In granting foreign exchange loans (except in the case of sub-
loans from the first IBRD loan to PICIC where the foreign exchange
risk is covered by Government) the exchange risk is passed on to
the ultimate borrowers.
(v) Staff Recruitment and Training
(a)  In order to strengthen its own management and staff as well
as to assist its clients in the formulation and conduct of
their projects, Corporation has continued to build up an
effective organization and develop an adequate staff poss-
essing skills in finance, marketing and economic analysis,
engineering, accountancy and law, and
(b)  Corporation has been sending out members of its technical
staff for training at IBRD, IFC, Economic Development
Institute and other development financing agencies abroad;
at the same time Corporation has trained officers of other
institutions and is particularly ready to receive for train-
ing officers from newly established development banks for
their initial training.
(vi) Reserves
The Corporation continues to build reserves consistent with sound
financial practices. In the past the practice has been to place
roughly 50% of the profits to reserves, in addition to capital
gains realised from the sale of investments and intention is to
continue this policy.
(vii)  Broadening Industrial Ownership
(a) In the case of new as well as existing larger industrial
enterprises, as a condition of financing, Corporation has
required that certain percentage of the share capital is
offered to the general public as a means to broaden the
base of industrial ownership;
(b)  The Corporation has, wherever  practicable, made direct
equity investments or obtained conversion rights and then
sold some of its investments in the open market to further
the growth of the capital market. In selling any investments
it pays due regard not only to its own interests but also to
the interests of other participants in such enterprise as
well as to the steady and sound growth of stock exchanges
in the country; and

various enterprises, either made directly or acquired
through conversion rights, is normally restricted to the
paid-up capital and free reserves of the Corporation.
(viii) Control over the Corporation
The Directors will use their powers to prevent any one person,
or company, or group of affiliated persons or companies obtain-
ing effective control of the Corporation.

PAKISTAN INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTIv1NT CCRPORATION LIMITED
Agreement Between the Government of Pakistan and PICIC on Foreign
Currency Liabilities in East Pakistan
AGREEMNT dated December 20, 1972 between the Islamic Republic of
Pakistan (hereinafter called the Government) and the Pakistan Industrial
Credit and Investment Corporation Limited (hereinafter called PICIC).
Considering that:
(a)    Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation
Limited (PICIC) has large assets in East Pakistan and
PICIC has correspondingly large liabilities towards
the Government and other internal and external agencies
and institutions with respect to its operations in East
Pakistan;
(b)    the assets which PICIC owns in East Pakistan are for
the time being not accessible to it; and
(c)    PICIC's financial position is, therefore, impaired;
And since the Government is keen to promote the industrial development of
the country and towards that end desires that PICIC should be enabled to
become an acceptable recipient of financial assistance from external and
local agencies and generally to function and operate as a strong and
financially solvent indastrial development institution;
Therefore, the Government and PICIC have agreed as follows:
1.        The foreign currency liabilities of PICIC pertaining to East
Pakistan and the corresponding assets over which PICIC retains no de facto
control would be segregated and transferred to a Trust Fund to be created
by PICIC.
2.        Notwithstanding the transfer of such liabilities to the Trust
Fund, PICIC would remain finally liable for the liabilities so transferred,
subject to the arrangement set out herein.
3.        For the time being and so long as the Government continues to
service external debt liabilities pertaining to East Pakistan, the Govemment
will provide to the Trust Fund necessary resources on such terms and conditions
as may be mutually agreed upon to service external liabilities of PICIC per-
taining to East Pakistan to the extent that they are not covered by recoveries
of assets of PICIC in East Pakistan.



Annex 11
Page-2
4.        Except as may be otherwise agreed between the Government and
PICIC, the Government shall not require the Trust Fund or PICIC to repay
all or any part of the resources provided by the Government to the Trust
Fund and interest thereon until such time as the external loans obtained
by PICIC after 30 November 1972 have been repaid or until PICIC recovers
its assets in East Pakistan or obtains compensation therefor, whichver
be earlier.
