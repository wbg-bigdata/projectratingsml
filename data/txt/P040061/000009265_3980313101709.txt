Block A: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
The objectives of the proposed project are: (a) to alleviate poverty through rural development in Bengkulu, the second poorest
province in Sumatra on the basis of GDP per capita and proportion of the population living below the poverty line; and (b) to generate
economic growth in rural areas of Bengkulu where growth potential is high.
I.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):

....................................................................................................... ........ ............................................................................................................. ..................................................................................
3. Project benefits and target population:
The quantifiable benefits of the project are increased farm incomes from adoption of new agricultural technologies, and benefits
from different types of village infrastructure investments (e.g., savings in transport costs for village roads, consumer surplus for water,
increased farn incomes for village irrigation). The non-quantifiable benefits are the strengthening of village institutions, building of
government agencies' capacity to support village-based initiatives, and development of rural markets for agricultural inputs.
About 40,000 households living in the 220 project villages located in 16 kecamatans (sub-districts) should benefit directly from the
project, in terms of increased farm incomes and improved village infrastructure. These villages were chosen from each of the three
rural districts or regencies (kabupaten) of Bengkulu, namely North Bengkulu, South Bengkulu and Rejang Lebong, based on such
criteria as poverty, absence of other major development projects and possibility of clustering by three to five villages. (Villages
already participating in relatively large government projects and oil palm/rubber estates have been excluded. About thirteen villages
supported under the Second Village Infrastructure Project are included, but only for agricultural activities.) Another 100,000
households living in the 16 kecamatans covered by the project should also benefit indirectly from improved extension services,
increased availability of quality seedlings, etc.
........................................................................................................................................................................................................................... ..................................
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: The project will be implemented over a six-year period, from GOI's FY 1998/99 (which starts on April 1,
1998) to FY 2003/04 (which ends on March 31, 2004).
Implementing agencies: Based on the successful model of the two Bank-assisted Village Infrastructure Projects (VIP, see Section
15 B), the main implementors will be the villages, which will manage 60 percent of the total project cost. A major difference between
the VIPs and this project is that villages will directly implement activities in both infrastructure and agriculture, not only infrastructure,
for the first time under a Bank project in Indonesia. The government agencies at the provincial and district levels will mainly support
the villages in project implementation: they include the agricultural Dinas (technical agencies), which have managed most of the funds
directly under previous Bank agricultural projects. The project will be implemented by existing organizations; no new organizations
will be established to implement the project. At the different administrative levels, the following agencies/groups would be involved
in the implementation of various project activities:
Village Level:
The LKMD (village community resilience institution, often translated as "village council") will be responsible for
managing a village grant, organizing villagers and procuring materials, to implement the Village Infrastructure
Component and the Village-Based Technology Adoption Component. This approach has been highly successful for
infrastructure development under the Bank-assisted Village Infrastructure Projects; it would be applied to agriculture for
the first time under the project. The LKMD would be supported by the agricultural extension workers (abbreviated as PP
for penyuluh pertanian, called PPS and PPL until 1996) on agriculture, and by the Field Engineers on infrastructure, with
specific additional support provided by the kecamatan-based community development facilitators or pendamping (e.g. on
conducting Participatory Rural Appraisal up front, disseminating information on the revolving fund).
District (kabzpaten) Level:
*    BAPPEDA Level II (District Development Planning Agency) will be responsible for the coordination, supervision and



Page 3
progress monitoring of BRDP at the district level.
*   Dinas PU (public works) at Level II will delegate technical and field work to the consultant Field Engineers, and be
responsible for administrative aspects of the Village Infrastructure Component, for instance signing of the village
implementation agreements with LKMDs and enabling fund withdrawal by LKMDs. There will be a Project Manager
(Pimpro) appointed at the Dinas PU Level II (called DPUK) in each kabupaten. This is based on the VIP model.
*   BIPP (Agricultural Information and Extension Center) in each project-supported kabupaten will, mainly through the PPs
(agricultural extension workers) they manage, assist villages in developing and implementing programs for adoption of
new agricultural technologies, review technology adoption plans prepared by the villages, and be responsible for the
overall administration/supervision of the Village-Based Technology Adoption Component. There will be a Pimpro
appointed at the BIPP in each kabupaten. The BIPP will also be responsible for training and other capacity building
activities, targeted at the BIPP, the BPP (Rural Extension Center, each usually covering one kecamatan) and the PPs.
*   The PPs, managed by BIPP, would: (i) provide technical support to the project villages, both at the testing stage (e.g.,
especially in identifying farming systems for testing of the technologies to be conducted by "pioneer farmers") and
replication stage; and (ii) observe/record the results of farmer-based tests and report them to INPPTP which will assess
the progress of technology testing.
*   Dinas for agriculture at Level II will provide technical advice to INPPTP on development of technology packages under
the Village-Based Technology Adoption Component.
Provincial Level.
* BAPPEDA Level I (Provincial Development Planning Agency) will be responsible for: (i) the overall coordination and
monitoring of the project; (ii) management of Technical Assistance for Capacity Building/Implementation Support; (iii)
farmer-based technology testing (to be contracted to INPPTP); and (iv) province-level implementation support. It will
also prepare, with inputs from the TA Team for Capacity Building/Implementation Support, the General Guidelines for
Project Implementation (uklak) to be assisted and verified by the Central Guidance Committee (see below), and the
Technical Guidelines for Project Implementation (juknis), both for use by villages and government agencies. There will
be a Pimpro for the whole project appointed by BAPPEDA Level I.
* INPPTP (Assessment Unit for Agricultural Technology) located in Bengkulu will be contracted by BAPPEDA Level I, to
conduct: (i) development of recommended technology packages for farmer-managed trials; (ii) supervision, monitoring,
and analysis of the trials; and (iii) compilation/analysis of their results and refinement of the packages. The INPPTP will
be assisted by the PPs in the supervision and monitoring of trials, especially for the second and third batches of villages.
(Contracting out of research-related activities to a public institution has been done under the First and Second
Agricultural Research Management Projects, both Bank-supported. For the Bengkulu project, this approach will be used
to channel funds through the Pimpro at BAPPEDA Level I.)
* Dinas PU (public works) Level I will manage the Field Engineering Services consultancy, as well as the training of Field
Engineers and relevant government personnel.
* PMD (village community development agency) Level I will be responsible for dissemination of key project-related
information (e.g., the principles of bottom-up and community-based approaches) to the communities and government
agencies through notices, newspaper articles, radio spots, etc.
Project coordination: Due to the decentralized nature of the project, most day-to-day coordination would be undertaken at the
district and provincial levels, by the BAPPEDA. The institutional framework for coordination is as follows:
District Level:
*   BAPPEDA Level II will coordinate project activities, between the various executing agencies and across the different
project components. A coordination team (Tim Koordinasi), represented by the government agencies concerned, will be
set up to meet from time to time.
Provincial Level:
* BAPPEDA Level I will coordinate project activities, between the various executing agencies and across the different
project components. A coordination team (Tim Koordinasi), represented by the government agencies concerned, will be
set up to meet from time to time.
Central Level:
* BAPPENAS (National Development Planning Agency), or more specifically its Deputy V for Regional Development,
will coordinate policy matters pertaining to the project, as a chairing agency of the Central Guidance Committee (CGC).
The other central government agencies which would be members of the CGC and support project implementation
include: the Directorate General of Budget of the Ministry of Finance; the Directorate General of Regional Development
(BANGDA), more specifically its Directorate of Area Development, and the Directorate General for Public



Page 4
Administration and Regional Autonomy (PUOD), of the Ministry of Home Affairs; and the Secretariat General (more
specifically its Bureau of Planning and the National Center for Agricultural Extension) as well as the Agency for
Agricultural Research and Development or AARD (its Center for Agricultural Socio-economic Research) of the Ministry
of Agriculture.
*  BANGDA's Directorate of Area Development will act as the secretariat for the CGC, to assist the provincial and local
governments in preparing the project-related annual budgets, organize inter-agency meetings at the central level, and
liaise with the Bank.
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.): As described above in the "project coordination" section, the CGC coordinated by
Deputy V of BAPPENAS and BANGDA acting as its secretariat will provide the overall oversight for the project.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: Since about 60 percent of the project cost will be managed by the
villages, much of the financial records will be kept by the LKMD, to be assisted by the Field Engineers who will be available at the
beginning of the village activities. The overall institutional arrangements for accounting, financial reporting and auditing
arrangements are as follows:
Accountine/financial reporting. The Government accounting system will be applied. In addition, specific project accounting
systems and procedures will be described in the Guidelines for Project Implementation, which will be distributed to the
participating villages. The details of the accounting/financial reporting arrangements are provided in Annex 7. Each implementing
agency, including LKMD, would establish and maintain an adequate and separate account from the beginning of project
implementation, and the institutional responsibilities are summarized below:
Village Level:
*  The LKMD would prepare quarterly progress reports, including financial reports, and submit them to the Pimpros
concerned at the district level, on the second week of the fourth month. Largely in line with the Bank-supported VIP
projects, each village will keep track of the village grant, through: (i) their own accounts at BRI (Bank Rakyat Indonesia,
a state commercial bank); (ii) bank statements issued by BRI; (iii) data related to the Village Infrastructure Component
collected by the LKMD, concerning for instance employment, outputs and remuneration; and (iv) data related to the
Village-Based Technology Adoption Component, concerning the allocation of grants to "pioneer farmers" for testing,
and of loans to other farmers during the replication phase. The village accounts will be kept in a nearby BRI unit desa;
BRI's district office (cabang) will oversee records of withdrawals and deposits. After the revolving fund is started
during the third year of project activities in each village, BRI cabang will assist the villages in the following ways:
training of village administrators; provision of advisory services for financial management; reconciliation of account
balances; and screening of the village treasurer.
District Level:
*  Each executing agency compiles its own financial records: Dinas PU Level II for the Village Infrastructure Component;
the BIPPs and participating agricultural Dinases for the Village-Based Technology Adoption Component; and
BAPPEDA Level II for the Capacity Building/Implementation Support Component.
* BAPPEDA Level II consolidates the financial records for each kabupaten, on a quarterly basis.
Provincial Level:
* BAPPEDA Level I would: (i) compile the financial records for all project activities conducted at the provincial level, in
particular the two consulting services packages and the INPPTP contract (see Annex 6); (ii) consolidate the financial
records from three project kabupaten on a quarterly basis; and (iii) prepare consolidated financial reports for the project
as a whole, including records to be received from BANGDA concerning the project secretariat at the central level, and
provide them to the Bank on a quarterly basis.
Central Level:
* BANGDA compiles the financial records for the project secretariat at the central level, and provides them to BAPPEDA
Level I on a quarterly basis.
Auditing:
Village accounts will be reviewed by the local governments, consultants engaged under the Capacity Building/
Implementation Support Component, and Bank supervision missions on a random sampling basis. BPKP (Financial and
Development Supervisory Board) audits the consolidated project account put together by BANGDA, based on a consolidated
report prepared by BAPPEDA Level I and audited by the Perwakilan (provincial office) of BPKP, as well as the SOE and the
Special Account prepared by DG Budget, Ministry of Finance.

Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Each implementing agency (see above) will be responsible for the monitoring of key
progress indicators for its component in its district, and reporting them to the BAPPEDA Levels I and II on a monthly basis.
BAPPEDA Levels I and 11 will be responsible for coordinating the monitoring/evaluation of the project activities at the provincial and
district levels, and BAPPEDA Level I will prepare quarterly project progress reports and provide them to the Bank. The TA
consultants for Capacity Building/Implementation Support will assist in establishing procedures and institutional arrangements for
monitoring and evaluation.
Block B: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: 1669 I-IND of June 13, 1997
The Bank's latest CAS (Country Assistance Strategy) for Indonesia identifies the following as the main agenda: (a) maintaining
macroeconomic stability; (b) increasing efficiency and productivity in the private and public sectors; and (c) enhancing equitable and
sustainable development. The last is to be addressed through efforts in the following three areas: promoting regional development;
reducing poverty and inequality; and managing the environment sustainably. The project is one of "a series of region-specific rural
development programs" (the CAS) designed to contribute to the first two efforts, by assisting development of the second poorest
province in Sumatra. The project is also consistent with a CAS objective to manage the environment sustainably, as it should help
reduce encroachment pressures on the Kerinci-Seblat National Park through poverty alleviation/growth generation outside the Park.
Improvement of park management is being assisted by the Bank/GEF-financed Kerinci Seblat Integrated Conservation and
Development Project (ICDP).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The key sectoral issues that concern the project, and GO's strategies to address these issues, are as follows.
A. High incidence of povertv in Bengkulu. In 1990, 24.56 percent of Bengkulu's population was living below the poverty line (in
terms of consumption adjusted for cost of living), which was the second highest among the eight Sumatra provinces (after Lampung),
and considerably higher than the average for Indonesia (19.63 percent). There are other indicators demonstrating the province's low
level of income: its GDP per capita which was the second lowest in Sumatra and 40 percent lower than the national average in 1992;
and its people were more dependent on unsafe sources of drinking water than most places in Indonesia (with 22 percent of households
directly deriving water from rivers). Poverty has induced farmers to encroach the National Park area. GOI has been implementing
the IDT (Inpres Desa Tertinggal - Program for Villages Left Behind) program in the province, with mixed results.
B. Natural/physical constraints to development in Bengkulu. Bengkulu is faced with formidable natural/physical constraints to
economic development. First, its land is mountainous, with the Bukit Barisan mountain range running from north to south and steep
hills leading down to the coastal strip. Second, while the rich biodiversity in the Kerinci-Seblat area (e.g., raflesia, tigers, rhinos) is a
precious asset to the province, it has also caused 21 percent of Bengkulu's land to come under the National Park, which limits
economic activities in the area. Third, despite its long coastline extending 400 kilometers, the waters of the Indian Ocean are often
rough, making marine fisheries difficult, particularly during the rainy season (November - April) when the winds blow from the west.
C. Poor soils and soil management. Fertile soils (mostly andosol and regosol) are concentrated in plateau areas in and around the
Kerinci-Seblat National Park. Soils in lowland areas are notoriously poor (mostly podsolic and latosol), with expanses of peat
swamps along the coast. The limited use of fertilizers in Bengkulu (lowest in Sumatra and accounting for only 0.3 percent of
Indonesia's total fertilizer consumption) is compounding the problem. Most of the province's rubber (64,000 ha) is grown on ultisols
(red-yellow podzolic soils), where phosphorus deficiency is endemic, and in coffee growing areas, potassium deficiency is common
(as large amounts of potassium have been removed through coffee harvests over an extended period, without much replenishment).
D. Low agricultural productivity in Bengkulu. Although agriculture dominates Bengkulu's economy, accounting for 36 percent of
GDP and 72 percent of employment in 1994, its agricultural productivity is low, even compared with the other Sumatra provinces. Its
wetland paddy yield (3.6 tons/ha) was considerably lower than the Sumatra average (4.0 tons/ha), and similarly for coffee, rubber, oil
palm, dryland paddy and cassava. In areas far from growing markets such as the kotamadya (municipality) of Bengkulu, subsistence
farming is common. The low agricultural productivity can be traced to poor soils, lack of new technologies and weak linkages with
markets. GOI has been addressing this issue with project interventions, especially the ADB-financed Tree Crop Smallholder
Subsector Project (TCSSP) and the Bank-supported Provincial Integrated Agricultural Development Project (PIADP).
E. Institutional constraints to agricultural extension. GOI institutions have not had great success in disseminating new agricultural



Page 6
technologies to smallholders, especially in upland areas for a number of reasons. First, the extension service has traditionally
extended a fixed package of technology and inputs for rice production in lowland areas, and it is not geared towards developing
upland agriculture, for which the environment is extremely heterogeneous (Hayami, 1996). Second, the extension service was
compartmentalized into four subsectors in 1991, making it difficult to take a holistic, farming systems-based approach to extension,
and has lacked the institutional capacity to interact with farmers in a participatory manner. Third, the reliance on demonstration plots
managed by the agricultural Dinas has not been effective in disseminating technologies, partly due to delays and inefficiencies in
disbursing funds (see Section 8 below). GOI has taken steps in recent years to address the first two issues: after conducting a study
with the Bank during 1995-96, they have promulgated a new policy, integrating all extension workers in a district to work under a
single new lead extension center (BIPP) which reports directly to the kabupaten governments. For this fiscal year, GOI has allocated
Rp. 75 billion as a central government grant (Inpres) to support the extension workers in implementing the new policy. The proposed
Decentralized Agriculture and Forestry Extension Project (board presentation expected for FYI 998 or 1999) is envisaged to support
implementation of this policy in eight selected kabupaten.
F. Smallholders' access to agricultural credit. While Indonesia is well known for the success of a rural credit program, the BRI unit
desa system, formal financial institutions are generally reluctant to provide loans to smallholders for agriculture. GOI-backed rural
cooperatives (KUDs) have the mandate to provide loans to smallholders, but they are often poorly managed and not operational. GOI
has achieved some success with donor-assisted rural credit programs, most notably the IFAD-assisted P4K (Income-Generating
Project for Marginal Farmers and Landless) now being implemented in many provinces, and the GTZ - assisted PHBK (Project
Linking Banks and Self-Help Groups), but their overhead costs are high and their sustainability is not clear. Moreover, most rural
credit programs (including these donor-assisted schemes) lend almost exclusively to quick-return, non-agricultural activities (e.g.
trade, processing), and the lack of formal funding is particularly problematic for tree crop development, which requires several years
before the planted trees become productive.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
A. On high incidence of povertv in Bengkulu. As mentioned above, poor villages were given priority in selecting project villages.
B. On natural/physical constraints to development in Bengkulu. The project will assist with the balanced development/conservation
strategy for the province, by investing in small-scale, village-based agricultural and infrastructural development activities away from
the Kerinci-Seblat National Park.
C. On poor soils and soil management. Village-based testing and dissemination of new agricultural technologies will involve soil
recapitalization techniques (in particular an initial ameliorative application of rock phosphate to recapitalize soil phosphorus on acid
upland soils), successfully implemented in the nearby provinces of West Sumatra and Lampung by GOI's Center for Soils and
Agroclimate Research with assistance from GTZ. GOI is becoming aware of the potential for this technique, and has made
arrangements to import large amounts of high-quality Tunisian rock phosphate for direct application in upland farming systems.
D. On low agricultural productivity in Bengkulu. The low agricultural productivity will be addressed through village-based
technology testing and adoption.
E. On constraints to agricultural extension. Under the project, budgetary resources will be provided directly to the beneficiaries (not
the service providers), and the PPs (agricultural extension workers) will serve them under contracts to be signed with the LKMD. The
project will also help establish the new decentralized extension system now being introduced in Indonesia, as described above. Since
the details of the new system (e.g. incentive structure) are being finalized by GOI, the project will support some capacity building
efforts which are necessary regardless of the final policy decision, namely training of GOI extension staff in participatory methods
and farming systems approaches, and training of farmers to conduct farmer-to-farmer training, which has been successful in West
Sumatra.
F. On smallholders' access to agricultural "redit. The project will provide a grant directly to each village, about 44 percent of which
will be used as a "revolving fund" to finance adoption of new agricultural technologies by farmers. The grant will be used by the
village itself (through LKMD) to procure the necessary inputs, and farmers will repay into the village account as a loan, basically at
market terms (see Annexes 2 and 4 for details).
ec altemratives considered and reasons for rejection;
The main alternative considered was a more conventional project design, where the government technical agencies (Dinas) would
be the main implementing agency, in the sense that they would receive the bulk of project budget and use it to execute project



Page 7
activities (e.g., procurement/distribution of agricultural inputs, letting of construction contracts). In fact this was the proposal put
forth early in the preparation process; the central part of their design was a large-scale program of demonstration plots ("demplots")
executed by the subsectorally-divided agricultural Dinases. This design was replaced by the current design (a village-based approach)
during pre-appraisal, mainly for the following reasons:
(a) although timing is essential with agricultural activities, field demonstrations by government agencies are often untimely
and rushed, since the government's usual budgetary procedures make funds available at the local level only at a certain time,
from fund release (at the earliest in September) to the end of the fiscal year (the following March). Demplots, especially
those involving tree crops, often collapse and farmers associate these with failure. The availability of a grant at the village
level, if provided in a timely manner, would help ensure effective implementation of technology trials/demonstration;
(b) in adopting technologies, farmers listen more to well-performing farmers (especially those nearby) than anybody else.
The success of the fanner-to-farmer extension scheme in West Sumatra is an excellent example;
(c) villages seem to have adequate institutional capacity to organize village-level development activities, as demonstrated by
the first VIP project. VIP II has been started in Sumatra, including four kecamatans in Bengkulu, all covered by BRDP;
(d) few, if any, farmers conduct monocropping, thereby making it sensible to work closely with BIPPs which are not divided
along subsectoral lines; and
(e) transferring funds directly to villages would help link farmers with the input providers, and hence lead to development of
markets for agricultural inputs.
Compared with the alternative, the new project design should be able to support the beneficiaries in a more timely, demand-
driven, community-managed, and market-based manner.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
OED's report on area development projects (1993) has highlighted a number of key lessons. Probably the most relevant are the
lessons on project design. A "process approach", which concentrates upon building problem-solving capacity among the people
involved, has been successful. Short-term benefits are powerful incentives for people to participate in the project during the early
"confidence-building" stage (e.g., the Aga Khan Rural Support Program in Pakistan). Project design should be as simple and flexible
as possible, and implementation of different components in an integrated manner has been "accident-prone." It is useful to build in a
"preparation for implementation" or capacity-building phase at the beginning of a project. Binswanger (1994) listed lack of
beneficiary participation, complexity of coordination and lack of appropriate technology among the causes of failure with integrated
rural development projects in the past.
In Indonesia, the "first generation" of agriculture-based regional development projects, five projects approved by the board during
FY1980 - 91, focused on specific provinces and involved the regional governments substantially in their preparation and
implementation. These projects have generated location-specific upland farming technologies, contributed to development of local
institutions, experimented with approaches for cooperation with project-area NGOs, and fostered operational linkages between
research and extension. However, the central government agencies still played major roles. Partly because of this, local conditions,
such as local market situations, social factors, needs and incentives of stakeholders (especially communities), could have been more
fully incorporated into the design of these projects. The first project was judged unsatisfactory in the Bank's Project Performance
Audit Report, on grounds of over-ambitious project objectives, problems with project design, and non-replicable/non-sustainable land
development strategy. The performance of the other projects has been better.
The two "second generation" projects were approved during FY1996, and prepared in line with GOI's policy and the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy, which aimed at promoting decentralization. Their main features included: collaborating directly and
intensively with the regional governments; adopting a menu-based approach for sub-projects; dove-tailing with ongoing sectoral
projects (for instance in research); and supporting larger-scale NGO participation.
It can be said that the proposed project marks the start of "third generation" projects. It differs from the previous generations of
projects in the following respects: the project activities are implemented largely by the communities, while government agencies
mainly provide technical assistance to villages; a participatory needs assessment is conducted at the beginning of preparation; and
private sector organizations are involved in implementation.
~~~~~~~~~~~~........................................................................................................................................................................................................I..............................
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
A. Borrower's establishment and funding of preparation task forces. GOI established apokja (task force) at the provincial and district
levels, specifically for project preparation. Each task force is represented by GOI agencies concerned and has been operational since
April 1996. They will be transformed into Coordination Teams (Tim Koordinasi) for project implementation.
B. Appointment of senior staff for BIPPs. During pre-appraisal in April/May 1997, it was agreed that GOI would appoint, as a
condition of appraisal, qualified specialists as senior staff for the three newly-created BIPPs, due to their importance to project
implementation. (In this case "senior staff' was understood to mean, for each BIPP, the head and five PPS or Subject Matter
Specialists.) The appointments were formally completed before appraisal.
ja           ............................................................................................................................................................................................................I..............................
12. Value added of Bank support:
The Bank is well placed to support GOI in implementing the project, for the following reasons:
(a) the Bank is supporting an innovative community-based project (the Second Village Infrastructure Project or VIP 11),
being implemented in Sumatran provinces including Bengkulu (40 villages in four kecamatans to be supported during fiscal
years 1997/98 -1998/99), which provides a sound basis on which to build a community-based operation;
(b) the Bank has established a close working relationship with the regional governments concerned and built up a sound
understanding of economic development issues in the province, through such projects as VIP 11 and PIADP; and
(c) the Bank has accumulated useful experience from the previous regional development projects.

15. Technical Assessment:
A. Agricultural development.
Overall concept of technology testing and dissemination. Under the project, villagers themselves would manage a grant, to
perform two types of technical activities usually conducted by government agencies: testing of selected proven technologies; and
disseminating them to farmers. Through a PRA process, villagers would select farming systems for testing/dissemination, from
packages identified by INPPTP and included in the Technical Guidelines for Project Implementation (juknis). Villages would prepare
annual plans for testing/dissemination, which would be reviewed by the BPP concerned. Testing of technologies would first be
conducted by five "pioneer farmers" on their own plots during the first year, who will enter into a contract with the LKMD and the
BPP, to share the experience with other farmers. After further testing by another ten farmers the second year, wide
dissemination/replication will be supported by a revolving fund (see Annex 2) from the third year onwards.
Menu of technology packages. The menu of technology packages to be tested and replicated by the villages will comprise the
following three broad categories of farming systems. The initial packages will be finalized during PYI by INPPTP with help from
consultants engaged under the TA for Capacity Building/Implementation Support. While the four following packages have already
been identified, other packages may be added by INPPTP upon approval by the Bank, based on INPPTP's financial, social and
agronomic analysis of such packages (through farm budget analysis, etc.). It should be noted that rubber has been excluded from
packages to be supported under the revolving fund, since the long gestation period of rubber does not fit well with the specific
requirements of the revolving fund, i.e. to revolve reasonably fast to cover more beneficiaries each year. Rubber will be supported
under an extension pilot based on a partnership with the private sector (see Annex 2).
(a) estate crop-based systems
(i) oil palm aystems. (Including inter-crop system with groundnuts.) Planted areas for oil palm have been expanding in
Sumatra, given the favorable world prices. Since oil palm smallholdings are viable only when production is sufficient to
warrant a weekly fruit collection visit, oil palm will be supported under the project only when at least 25 farmers show
interest in participating. Villages may well decide to test oil palm in South Bengkulu, where oil palm is already planted
on about 6,000 hectares under PIR (nucleus estate and smallholders) schemes, and a PTP (a government-owned estate
"Nusantara VII") is in operation with excess processing capacity. The PTP has expressed an interest to purchase the fresh
fruit bunches and make available seedlings for purchase under the project.
(ii) coffee system. (Including inter-crop system with groundnuts.) Bengkulu is the third largest coffee producing
province in Indonesia, with around 40,000 tons produced annually from about 90,000 hectares, almost all of them
robusta coffee produced by smallholders. While some coffee is planted on land cleared by slash-and-bum farners in the
National Park area, intensive planting of coffee on own plots would be an attractive alternative, given its high returns.
Rejuvinative pruning is particularly promising, since many of the coffee stands are very old (sometimes in excess of fifty
years) and yields are quite low. Coffee farmers can also obtain help from the project to improve quality of green beans,
by choosing drying floors and hullers under the Village Infrastructure Component. The branch of AEKI (Indonesian
Coffee Exporters Association) in Bengkulu will implement a pilot program of private sector participation in the
marketing/processing aspects of the extension service.
(iii) fruit trees system. (Including inter-crop system with maize.) Fruit trees are promising, especially in areas not far
from markets. Durian is particularly attractive; improved seedlings produced by private nurseries in the province of
South Sumatra can be purchased under the project.
(b) other upland systems. Maize, groundnuts, ginger, etc. are promising in various parts of Bengkulu. Packages may be



Page 10
.......... a.................................................................................................................................I................................................................................................................
developed on the basis of these crops.
(c) wetland-based systems
rice/fish systems. In Bengkulu, many irrigated rice fields are presently cropped only once a year with traditional
varieties, and hence productivity is poor. There is scope for intensification, following the normal government program.
Further, farmers may want to introduce or improve rice-fish combination or rotation systems, which are attractive in areas
not far from the market and where good quality fingerlings are available. There are private hatcheries (e.g., six for
goldfish in Rejang Lebong), and the Government of South Bengkulu is planning to build a BBI (a government hatchery).
B. Infrastructure development
Overall strategy for ensuring technical standards. On technical aspects, the project will largely follow the concept of VIP II. This
means that the community through the LKMD will act as implementation agency, relying on participation of the village community.
Field Engineers from the private sector would be trained and deployed under the project, to assist villages with design and
implementation. Villages would select infrastructure sub-projects from a menu, through a PRA process assisted by the Field Engineers.
Standard designs are made available through the Technical Guidelines for Project Implementation (juknis). At the end of
planning/design, a village implementation agreement is produced, which is certified by the Field Engineers. Funds amounting up to
Rp. 90 million per village (lower than Rp. 120 million under VIP II) are disbursed into a bank account, according to progress.
Menu of infrastructure investments. The menu includes the following types of small village infrastructure: village roads, bridges,
jetties, improvement of small scale irrigation facilities (maximum area of 50 ha), water supplies, sanitary facilities, coffee drying floor,
huller machines for coffee, fish drying facilities, agricultural input storages, fish smoking houses, and fingerling ponds. The menu is
similar to the one for VIP, but includes irrigation improvement and post-harvest facilities mentioned above.
16. Institutional Assessment:
a. Implementing agencies: There are key implementing agencies at the provincial and district levels. At both levels, support would
be provided by the TA consultants for Capacity Building/Implementation Support.
At the provincial level, BAPPEDA Level I will be responsible for planning, coordinating and monitoring, which is consistent with
its main mandates in the province. It has coordinated the government's preparation efforts at the regional level, as the chairing agency
of the preparation task force. It has 71 staff, including 42 with university-level education.
INPPTP, which would manage the technology testing program, is the sole agency mandated to test and assess agricultural
technologies in the province, under the guidance of BPTP (Assessment Institute for Agricultural Technology) in Sukarami, West
Sumatra, where much relevant research has been conducted under similar agro-climatic conditions. Both agencies are being
strengthened through the ongoing ADB - assisted Participatory Development of Agricultural Technology Project (mostly though
provision of facilities and equipment), and are guided by the Agency for Agricultural Research and Development (Ministry of
Agriculture) in Jakarta, which manages a wide network of research covering the whole country. Given its critical role in the project,
INPPTP has been authorized to increase its professional staff substantially from the current thirteen.
At the district level, BAPPEDA Level II's role in the project is well justified, in the same way it is at the provincial level. Each has
led the project preparation effort in its respective kabupaten, as the chairing agency of the preparation task force. Each BAPPEDA has
about 28 - 30 staff, of which one-third to a half have university degrees.
BIPPs have just been established in 1996, one for each kabupaten, and at appraisal all three BIPPs were still operating in temporary
offices. All PPs in the province, including the 620 formerly-called PPLs, would come under the auspices of one of the BIPPs, and
assigned to one of the 34 BPPs (Rural Extension Centers, with at least one in each kecamatan).
Dinas PU Level II is a large organization, especially in South Bengkulu which counts more than 350 staff. (The are 80 - 90 in each
of the other two kabupatens.) They comprise three different sections, bina marga (roads), pengairan (irrigation) and cipta karya
(settlements). The staff have been accumulating valuable experience from implementing the OECF-financed Rural Area Infrastructure
Development Project, and the Bank-financed VIP II.
The agricultural Dinas Level II, four of them existing in each district (food crops, tree crops, fisheries, livestock), will provide
technical advice to INPPTP, especially site-specific information on farming systems. There are around 150 - 170 agricultural Dinas
staff in each of the kabupatens.

b. Project management: The project was initially conceived to cover three of the four provinces overlapping with the Kerinci-
Seblat National Park: Bengkulu, Jambi and West Sumatra. However, in late 1995, it was agreed between GOI and the Bank that
Bengkulu will be covered under one free-standing project which will be prepared first, because of the difficulty in
designing/implementing such a large project and Bengkulu's relative poverty. (In June 1996, the other two provinces were also agreed
to be covered by two separate projects.) Being a single-province project will make project management much easier than otherwise.
The challenges of managing this project would come from the relative lack of experience of the government staff in implementing
donor-assisted projects, a unorthodox project design, and direct implementation of most project activities by the numerous villages. In
view of these challenges, the project will be implemented in a phased manner, with the first year being largely preparatory, gradually
involving more villages over the years (40 starting in PY1, 76 next, then 104), and with a 3.5-year, phased program of community-
based development activities for each village.
~~~~~~~...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
17. Social Assessment:
A three-step approach to social analysis was taken during preparation. At the start of preparation, a participatory Needs
Assessment (NA) was conducted in 14 selected villages across the province, to obtain an initial review of the principle social,
economic and institutional characteristics. The NA was conducted by local consultants, with the participation of Bank staff in field
work, and focused on farming practices, local institutions, social customs, economic needs, and effectiveness of past/ongoing
development projects. A variety of methods (e.g., rapid rural appraisal, ZOPP, focus group sessions, drawing village institution
diagrams) were used for this purpose.
The second step was a GIS-based Spatial Analysis, which showed different land uses, population densities, road networks and
other useful information on maps, to serve as a tool for project design, for instance in selecting project villages clusters.
The third step was a Social Analysis, conducted by a sociologist on the preparation consultant team.
From the above three efforts, the following have emerged as the main findings:
(a) the high degree of social/economic heterogeneity across villages, in terms of the roles of village institutions, types of
farning systems, linkages with markets, etc.;
(b) LKMD is the focal village institution as far as economic development activities are concerned. Basically all villages have
LKMDs. While there are clearly LKMDs with low level of activity, it can be argued that this is to a great part because they
have had neither the opportunity nor resources to actively engage themselves in development activities;
(c) customary leaders (kepala adat) often exist, are well respected, and play a vital social role in the village. In general, their
main roles are social, including dispute resolution and organizing ceremonies. However, customary institutions in Bengkulu
(Marga) were officially taken over by the modem government system in 1979, and it has been reported that the last Marga in
Bengkulu stopped functioning in 1981. In Rejang Lebong, a Council of Marga Representatives was recently established,
mostly to preserve local culture and customs;
(d) ethnically, the province is mixed. Two of the four large ethnic groups of Sumatra are represented, the Malays from the
east and south, and the Minangkabau with their heartland in West Sumatra. Other groups can be further identified, on the
basis of language and culture: for instance, the Rejang in Rejang Lebong; the Serawai, Pasemah and Kaur in South Bengkulu;
and the Pekal in North Bengkulu. There are also about 140,000 government-sponsored transmigrants from Java/Bali
(accounting for about 10 percent of the population), mostly in North Bengkulu. There are no "Indigenous People" as defined
by the Bank's OD 4.20 in the province;
(e) for the past ten years, there has been seasonal/permanent migration of people into the National Park area including those
from far away villages (e.g., from the southern end of South Bengkulu which is about 140 km away), drawn by greater
economic opportunities (mainly slash-and-burn); and
(f) women play a significant role in the rural economy, particularly in maintaining tree crop seedlings, tending small livestock
(e.g., chickens) and processing agricultural products (e.g., fish drying).
The project design has taken the above fndings into account. It has: (a) focused project activities at the village level, and adopted
a menu-based, participatory approach (rather than being prescriptive); (b) selected the LKMD as the main implementing agency; (c)
recognized customary leaders as important players in the village activities; (d) placed an important role on locally-recruited
pendamping, who should be assigned to communities with which they are familiar culturally; (e) included a large number of villages in
South Bengkulu with known migration to the National Park area; and (f) supporting activities which are usually conducted by women,
namely tending of seedlings.

LandAcquisition. There may be minimal land acquisition under the Village Infrastructure Component, but it is not possible to
assess how much land will be acquired, since the scale, type and location of infrastructure will be determined though a participatory
process (with basically the same approach as the two Village Infrastructure Projects in Indonesia. As has been the case with these
projects, land acquisition will be minimal, since the infrastructure will be: (a) of a small scale (at Rp. 90 million per village, smaller
than the VIP allocation of Rp. 120 million); (b) constructed in low population density, rural areas; (c) simple in design (e.g., upgrading
of a footpath into a gravel road); and (d) often improvement of existing infrastructure.
Compensation. The agreed VIP guidelines for land/asset acquisition and compensation will be applied. The guidelines allow for
voluntary contribution, which is a traditional practice. However, if land area needed is substantial (e.g., exceeds 20 percent of the
villager's plot), the affected villager will be given replacement land, equivalent productive assets or other in-kind compensation as
negotiated during village consultation meetings. (If land acquisition is proposed, the sub-project will not be approved by the Field
Engineers unless adequate compensation arrangements have been agreed by the villagers affected and the LKMD.) Field supervision
by Bank missions, the Field Engineers and government staff will monitor compliance with the guidelines.
Resettlement. In the unlikely event that a large number of persons are negatively affected due to a village sub-project (e.g., more
than 200 persons each losing more than 20 percent of his/her land), and if the consultant Field Engineer found no alternative that
would reduce the number of affected persons, then the Bank approval of a related compensation/resettlement plan would be sought
prior to proceeding with the sub-project. (This is the same approach as the one taken for VIPs.)

18. Environmental Assessment:         Environmental Category   Q   A         X   B      Q   C
The project is classified as "Category B" since the project is not expected to have major negative impacts on the environment.
Potential adverse impacts are not significant in complexity, severity or extent and are amenable to management by adherence to
standard operating procedures and good practice. The project is not expected to have major negative impacts on the environment,
according to an Environmental Analysis which was undertaken as part of project preparation.
Environmental considerations have been incorporated into the project design in the following ways. First, environmental concerns
have been a key criterion in selecting the project villages. To be consistent with the ICDP, villages have been selected in areas outside
the National Park (mostly outside its buffer zone), and villages with known migration to the Park area have been included. Second, on
agricultural activities, the selected technology packages will be based on sound environmental practices, and farmers would receive
guidance in adopting these technologies from INPPTP staff and the PPs. The technologies will be tested first over two years in each
village, monitored by INPPTP, before replication. Third, on infrastructure activities, standard operating procedures will be applied
through TA and monitoring conducted by Field Engineers, use of the Technical Guidelines for Project Implementation (based on the
VIP manual, which include designs based on environmental guidelines in accordance with the Bank's requirements), and review of
design by GOI's technical staff (Dinas PU). Fourth, environmental awareness will be promoted through community participation
exercises and government workshops.

Block D: Project Sustainability and Risks
20. Project Sustainability:
The key activity for enhancing project sustainability is the capacity building of the villages through a continuous 3.5-year program
of community development for each village. Other features which will contribute to sustainability are the following:
(a) selection of relatively low-cost, simple technologies, both for agriculture and infrastructure;
(b) requiring most of the agricultural part of the village grant to be repaid, so that more people can benefit from the revolving
fund;



Page 13
(c) requiring the LKMDs to place the revolving fund in a BRI account, and to be assisted by BRI in managing the fund
through fee-based services;
(d) involving the private sector associations for rubber and coffee, which have strong interests in improving the production
performance in the province; and
(e) including capacity building activities for government services (especially the extension service).

Overall project risk rating
Risk                    Risk Rating
See above.              Medium
ossible  ontroversial Aspects:
First, the use of the revolving fund. The revolving fund has not performed well in certain projects financed by the Bank and other
donors. It is argued that the proposed mechanism is justifiable for the proposed project, since: (a) a well-performing financial
institution (BRI) will provide fee-based services to assist the villages in managing the revolving funds (namely advisory services for
fund management, training of village administrators, reconciliation of account balances and screening of village treasurers); (b) the
loans from the fund will be at basically market terms, with market interest rates; (b) each village is prepared for 2.5 years before the
revolving fund is started (during which problems can be detected); (c) each loan package can only be provided for half hectare
maximum at a time (with the possible exception of oil palm), and farmers' interest to re-borrow and further apply the technology will



Page 14
be an incentive for repayment; and (d) there are successes with revolving funds in other projects, such as the Yogyakarta Upland Area
Development Project in Indonesia and the Environment and Natural Resources SECAL in the Philippines. The implementation
procedures of the revolving fund will be detailed in the Guidelines for Project Implementation.
Second, the high level of responsibility vested with the villages and LKMDs. While many of the LKMDs have not been active, this
is largely because they have not had the resources or opportunity to implement large development projects in the past. Although many
LKMDs are weak, the "learning by doing" approach under the project, through gradual implementation and on-the-job training, would
build up the capacity of village institutions.

Annex 2
Detailed Project Description
Overall Project Design
The project structure centers around a village grant equivalent to Rp. 180 million per village, which accounts for 60 percent
of the total project cost. The grant will be disbursed directly into a bank account at BRI unit desa and released to villages after
documentation is checked by Project Managers (Pimpros) at the Kabupaten level.
The LKMD will manage the grant to implement infrastructure and agricultural activities at the village level, to be supported
by INPPTP, BIPP/BPP and the Field Engineers. (For the revolving fund, the LKMD will be assisted by BRI.) The LKMDs are not
always active and usually require some capacity building, but the project design provides an opportunity for the villages to benefit
from "learning by doing," under the 3.5-year program of gradual implementation and on-the-job training. The infrastructure and
agricultural activities should be complementary to each other as much as possible: for instance, investment in tree crop plots can be
combined with a farm access road from the village to the plots. Each village will be supported over 3.5 years under the village grant,
and this program would be started with 40 villages in PYI, 76 in PY2 and 104 in PY3.
It should be noted that the project components (and more specifically their detailed cost tables) have been structured in line
with the location of Pimpros, to facilitate budgeting, planning and disbursement of project funds. Namely, the Village Infrastructure
Component and the Village-Based Technology Adoption Component only include kabupaten-level expenditures to be administered
by the Pimpros in each kabupaten. On the other hand, the Capacity Building/Implementation Support Component only comprise
province-level expenditures which are administered by the Pimpros at the provincial level.
Project Component 1 - Village Infrastructure Component - Total Cost US$ 7.6 million
The component would support villages in construction of village infrastructure, following the VIP (P3DT-World Bank)
model, with half (Rp.90 million) of the village grant allocated for this purpose. Consultant Field Engineers would be trained and
deployed to assist the villages in planning, design, construction supervision and maintenance. (The Field Engineering Services are
included in the Capacity Building/Implementation Support Component under a Pimpro at Dinas PU Level I, for the reason explained
above).
The component supports a short program of village infrastructure development in each village: preparation during April -
May/June; construction during June - October; and maintenance during November - March. (For each village, the infrastructure
activities are implemented during the same year as the first year of farmer-based testing, as described below.) Based on a Village
Action Plan developed before the start of the fiscal year through the PRA (participatory rural appraisal) process facilitated by the
pendamping, and by using designs prepared with assistance of the Field Engineers, the civil works should be implemented by the
community before the rainy (planting) season begins.
The menu of infrastructure investments, from which communities can choose to build themselves based on their needs,
include the following: (a) village roads; (b) bridges; (c) jetties; (d) improvement of small-scale irrigation facilities (maximum area of
50 hectares); (e) water supply facilities; (f) sanitation facilities (MCK, simple drainage, etc.); and (g) simple processing facilities
(coffee drying floors, fish drying floors, coffee hullers, agricultural input storage, product storage, fish smoking houses, fingerling
ponds). These are basically the same as the P3DT-World Bank projects, except for the additions of small-scale irrigation facilities
and simple processing facilities. The idea is that the infrastructure should be beneficial to the village as a whole (not only to certain
individuals), and yield economic returns.

Project Component 2 - Village-Based Technology Adoption Component - Total cost US$ 12.9 million
This component supports agricultural development of the project villages, through implementation of a 3.5-year support for
technology testing and replication in each village, using half (Rp.90 million) of the grant for each village. INPPTP and BIPP/BPP
will be the main providers of support for the villages. (INPPTP activities are included in the Capacity Building/Implementation
Support Component, for the reason explained above.)
During PYl (fiscal year 1998/99), INPPTP would, together with research and assessment institutes under AARD, and in
coordination with Dinas Level II, BIPP/BPP and TA consultants for Capacity Building/Implementation Support, identify specific
technology packages suitable for Bengkulu, and prepare implementation guidelines for each identified technology package, based on
the model of the Rubber KIT used in the GTZ-supported ProRLK project in West Sumatra. BAPPEDA Level I would coordinate
preparation of the Guidelines for Project Implementation (juklak andjuknis), for use by the implementing agencies and project
villages. Also during PY1, PRA training of relevant staff (pendamping and PPs) would be started by TA consultants for Capacity
Building/ Implementation Support.
Starting the end of PY I and continuing until PY6, the project will provide support for each project village over 3.5 years, in
three batches (40, 76 and 104 villages) in a phased manner. The 3.5-year program is structured as follows:
(a) the initial 0.5 year. During this period, PRA exercises would be conducted by a team coordinated by the pendamping and
including the PPs (and Field Engineers), to assist each village in preparing a Village Action Plan (VAP) which will include
the village's choice of agricultural testing (in addition to infrastructure development) which the village will want to
implement under the project. Farmer involvement in PRA exercises will help identify the main constraints to the
achievement of farming goals in the village as perceived by farmers. The PRA team would present various relevant options
for technological improvement, and the village prepares a plan for testing the chosen option. The agricultural part of the VAP
will be reviewed by the BPP responsible for the village.
The menu of agricultural packages would include three types of agricultural systems: estate crop-based systems; other upland
systems; and sawah-based systems. The initial packages will be finalized during PYI by INPPTP, assisted by the TA
consultants. Financial, social and agronomic viability of each package should be analyzed in detail (through farm budget
analysis, etc.), for approval by the Bank. Four specific systems have been identified as promising in Bengkulu and will be
included among such packages: (a) oil palm-based intercropping system; (b) coffee-based intercropping system; (c) fruit
tree-based intercropping system; and (d) rice/fish combination and rotation systems (minapad). (It should be noted that
AARD uses the term "farming systems" instead of "intercropping systems.")
(b) first year. The village selectsfzve pioneerfarmers. This is a critical step in the process: every effort must be made by the
PRA team to identify and select farmers with a proven track record of commitment, knowledge, creativity and initiative in
the chosen farming system. The LKMD signs a contract with the five farmers and the relevant BPP, which commits each
party to their rights and obligations under the project. The pioneer farmers take the risk of testing the new technology on
their own plots, and take on the responsibility of sharing their knowledge with other farmers; the agricultural inputs needed
for the trial are thus provided free of charge by the LKMD (at the amount of about Rp.0.6 - 0.8 million per farmer for half
ha, depending on the farming system model).
During the testing, INPPTP (assisted by PPs) would visit the village, to monitor the performance of trials. By the end of the
year, performance of the chosen farming systems would be analyzed and, if necessary, recommendations modified before the
next group of ten pioneer farmers per village begin their trials.
(c) second year, ten more pioneer farmers, who should also share their experience with fellow farmers, would be selected by
LKMD to conduct further testing through trials on their farms under the same contract arrangements as for the first five
farmers per village. These farmers would also receive free inputs, at the amount of about Rp.0.6 - 0.8 million per farmer for
half ha, depending on the farming system model. Monitoring of the trials would be carried out by INPPTP (assisted by PPs
and the pendamping). In the meantime, preparation would be done to start a revolvingfiund during the following year, using
the credit management expertise of BRI (with back stopping to be provided by the TA advisorslpendamping). For oil palm,
replication may be started in the second year if there is clear, written agreement to do so between the farmer and the
purchaser/processor.
(d) third year. Conditional upon sound management of the village grant and reasonable progress made with the agricultural
trials, the remainder of the village grant (about Rp.78 million) would be released into the village bank account as "seed

money" for a revolvingfund, to finance replication of technology packages by interested farmers, covering initial (first year)
investments for up to half hectare per farmer (which can be raised up to one hectare for oil palm if the village so requests),
basically at a market-based interest rate. (The interest rate has been agreed at 22.0% p.a., which is comparable with 21.0%
for TCSDP/TCSSP and 22.15% for P4K. This will be revisited each year, as part of reviewing the Guidelines for Project
Implementation.) The maximum area per loan is set relatively low at 0.5 ha, to keep low the amount of debt perfarmer,
maximize the number of initial borrowers, and diversifr the risk of no or late repayment. Guidelines for the use of the
revolving fund, especially the selection criteria for eligible borrowers and repayment terms, will also be detailed in the
Technical Guidelines for Project Implementation (juknis). The maximum loan amounts per one farner per application
(excluding labor) for the four main packages estimated at appraisal (to be reviewed during implementation) are as follows:
(i) oil palm-based systems: at Rp.767,500 per 0.5 ha with inter-cropping and Rp. 564,500 without;
(ii) coffee-based systems, at Rp.779,500 per 0.5 ha with inter-cropping system and Rp. 660,500 without;
(iii) fruit tree-based inter-cropping system at Rp.617,000 per 0.5 ha with inter-cropping system and Rp. 340,000 without;
and
(iv) rice/fish (minapadi) systems: rotation at Rp. 651,500 per 0.5 ha, and combination at Rp.609,000 per 0.5 ha.
The main features of the revolving fund are as follows:
(a) It is a market-based fund channeling mechanism for agricultural development, and not a village bank or a savings and
loan scheme (the Kepres of 1992 requires that all village banks with capital of Rp. 50 million or more be established as a
BPR or a cooperative, both of which are not practical for the Bengkulu project);
(b) The fund will be managed by villagers (three administrators for each village appointed by the LKMD - a supervisor, a
treasurer and a collector - the treasurer would need to go through BRI screening), and BRI will provide assistance to the
village as fee-based service, as described below;
(c) There will be basically two different loan terms under the revolving fund. For oil palm, coffee and fruit tree-based
systems, the period is four years. For annual crops, the period is two years. The repayment is to be made monthly in equal
installments, so that the revolving fund is gradually replenished and new loans are made possible. For each loan, the farmer
can choose between two grace periods: either a six-month grace to allow for revenues from annual crops (interest capitalized)
and at a lower monthly installment, or a fifteen-month grace which reduces farmers' cash flow pressures when trees are
being planted but at a higher monthly installment;
(d) The proposed loan terms would better fit the revolving fund mechanism than longer-term loans with longer grace periods.
Cash flow simulations show that, to take oil palm/groundnuts system as an example, all of the funds can be used to provide
loans for 102 farmers initially (assuming 0.5 ha each and a grace period of six months), and four new borrowers can take
loans every month from repaid installments - meaning that 57 percent of the average number of all households in project
villages (178) can benefit from the fund in the initial round, at least for half ha each. Each monthly installment would
amount to about Rp.34,000 with intercropping and Rp.25,000 without intercropping;
(e) Repayment would be encouraged through financial incentives (e.g., monthly rates), peer pressure (e.g., announcing
borrowers waiting in the next round) and the small loan size (covering only up to half hectare per application), which
requires the borrower to make repayments on time in order to apply for a second loan; and
(f) The fees would be debited from the villages' project accounts (the grant and the interest accruing on the grant), based on
the terms stipulated in the Guidelines and on a written agreement between BRI and BAPPEDA Level 1. (BRI confrmed that
no taxes will be levied on its services to farmers, and hence BRI fees can be covered by the village grants and their interest
earnings, although the village grants are financed 100 percent under the loan.)
The villages would be assisted in fund management by BRI, which would basically act as the channeling bank but would
also provide support services to the villages (namely, advisory services for fund management, provision of training reconciliation of
account balances and screening of village treasurers) on a fee basis. Interest would accrue to the deposited village grants, and the fees
would be deducted from the grant and accrued interest based on the Guidelines and BRI/BAPPEDA Level I agreement. This system
of BRI support is similar to the system established to support some 4,000 BKD or Badan Kredit Desa in Java/Madura, as well as
numerous TPSP or Tempat Pelayanan Simpan Pinjam which started operation in various parts of Indonesia, including Bengkulu.



Page 20
BRI would be a natural participant in the revolving fund scheme, since it is expected to be involved in the Village Infrastructure
Component as the "operational bank," as in the case of the Village Infrastructure Projects.
BRI provided in December 1997 a tentative fee proposal comprising a lump sum fee for the training of the
supervisors/collectors and treasurers (Rp. 530 million), annual fees for additional staff to work specifically on BRDP (Rp. 85 million),
and recurrent fees to be charged at I percent of disbursements from the revolving fund, and I percent of repayments into the
revolving fund. These terms will be finalized and specified in the Guidelines for Project Implementation, before the revolving funds
start (as early as in PY3 or FY2000/2001 for oil palm, and PY4 or FY2001/2002 for other crops).
As for the oil palm-based inter-cropping system, PTP Nusantara VII would participate in the project, specifically by
purchasing fruits which may be produced by BRDP-supported farmers, for processing in its own plant located in Kecamatan Talo,
Bengkulu Selatan. It would involve itself in village discussions at the beginning of the 3.5-year cycle for each village (with the BRDP
pendamping), to propose the terms of partnership and identify interested farmers. BRDP would conduct farmer-based tests and
provide funds which villages can use for oil palm development. Although GOI policy requires that the standard prices set by the
Ministry of Agriculture (DG Estates) be applied to all oil palm purchases including BRDP as the minimum purchase price, the
standard deductions of fruits from farmers (to service loan repayment) would not apply to BRDP farmers, since BRDP farmers would
be financed under the project (not under the standard GOI loan).
To complement the village-based testing and replication of agricultural technologies, the following sub-components are also
included in the component:
(a) support for decentralized agricultural extension, to prepare the BIPPs and PPs for the above activities. This activity
supports the new decentralized extension system now being implemented in Indonesia, which emphasizes the role of farmers
in developing demand driven extension programs. The activity includes: on-site training of farmers by PPs; training of PPs
in training management, technical issues and information management techniques; and provision of equipment/vehicles
(mostly motorcycles) and rehabilitation of buildings for some BIPPs/BPPs.
(b) Kabupaten-level implementation support, mainly to coordinate Kabupaien government activities aimed at supporting the
village activities. The sub-component would assist BAPPEDAs Level II in coordinating the advisory inputs provided by
agricultural Dinas Level II for development of technology packages, and more generally in functioning as the project
coordinating agency at the Kabupaten level, through provision of equipment, furniture, etc.
(c) a pilot program ofprivate sector participation in the marketing/progressing aspects of the extension service, to be
conducted jointly by AEKI (Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters) and BIPP in 10 villages in Kecamatan Kepahyang,
Kab. Rejang Lebong over two years;
(d) an expanded program of partnership (kamitraan) between GAPKINDO (Association of Indonesian Rubber Producers)
and BIPP in providing extension services to 27 project villages in Kecamatan Kerkap, North Bengkulu, over two years.;
(e) strengthening of the Dinas Tree Crops nursery in North Bengkulu, to diversify sources of supply for rubber planting
materials in the short run; and
(f) production of annual crop seeds by seed farmers in each Kabupaten.
Project Component 3 - Capacity Building / Implementation Support Component - Total cost US$ 5.2 million
The Capacity Building/Implementation Support Component includes the following activities designed to assist the
government agencies concerned in implementing the project and build their institutional capacity: Field Engineering Services for
village infrastructure; development of technology packages and monitoring/analysis of farmer-based testing by INPPTP; technical
assistance for Capacity Building/Implementation Support; dissemination of project-related information; and province-level
implementation support. Their details are as follows:
(a) field engineering services for village infrastructure. A team of Field Engineers would be mobilized to assist the villages
in planning, design, construction supervision and maintenance of the village infrastructure;
(b) development of technology packages and monitoring/analysis of farmer-based testing by INPPTP. As a contractor to
BAPPEDA Level I, INPPTP would identify relevant technology packages and prepare implementation guidelines for each
identified technology package during PYI (in consultation with agricultural Dinas Level II, regional/ national research



Page 21
institutions and TA consultants for Capacity Building/Implementation Support), and monitor/analyze the tests to be
conducted by pioneer farmers during PY2 - 5;
(c) technical assistance for Capacity Building/Implementation Support. The technical assistance consultant team will mainly
include five experts, who are specialists in farming systems (one national and the other international), training and human
resources, civil engineering/procurement and fnancial management. The total staff months are 20 international and 102
national. The team will select, engage and manage a group of 32 pendamping, in principle two for each Kecamatan, who are
expected to be young facilitators preferably with experience in implementing NGO projects and/or background in
agriculture. The pendamping's main responsibilities are to: (i) promote transparency at the village level, for instance by
informing target groups on overall project design; (ii) arranging for and coordinating PRA exercises; and (iii) help LKMDs
in agricultural activities, including provision of information on the revolving fund and input procurement.
The consultancy package will also include a PRA training courses to be conducted over three years for the pendamping, PPs
and BIPP staff, which should be sub-contracted to an experienced group such as a well-established national NGO.
The consultancy package will also include a series of "beneficiary surveys" to be conducted every year during PY2 - 6 in
villages selected on a random sampling basis, to assess the delivery of services to the project villages and the villagers'
response.
The consultant team will be contracted by and report to BAPPEDA Level I.
(d) information dissemination. This activity is intended to disseminate key project-related information (e.g., the principles of
bottom-up and community-based approach), to the communities and government agencies through notices, newspaper
articles, radio spots, etc. This will be conducted by PMD Level I.
(e) province-level implementation support. This activity is intended to assist BAPPEDA Level I in performing its role as the
project coordinating agency at the province level, through provision of equipment, furniture, etc.

3enefits and Beneficiaries
Benefits
The quantifiable benefits of the project are increased farm incomes from adoption of new agricultural technologies, and benefits
from different types of investments in village infrastructure (e.g., savings in transport costs for village roads, increased farm incomes
for village irrigation). The non-quantifiable benefits are the strengthening of village institutions, building of government agencies'.
capacity to support village-based initiatives, and development of rural markets for agricultural inputs.
The increased farm incomes from adoption of new agricultural technologies are expected to be significant, mainly for two
reasons. First, the current level of production (the "without project" case) is low in many of the villages, due to such
technical/institutional constraints as low availability of improved seeds/seedlings, inappropriate soil management, inadequate pest
management techniques, and inefficient methods for dissemination of new technologies. Second, the new agricultural technologies to
be introduced under the project are relatively low cost: in the case of rubber, less than half the level of large donor-financed
smallholder projects, on a per unit area basis.
Beneficiaries
About 40,000 households living in the 220 project villages should benefit directly from the project, in terms of increased farm
incomes and improved village infrastructure. Another 100,000 households living in the 16 kecamatans-(sub-districts) covered by the
project should also benefit indirectly from improved extension services, increased availability of quality seedlings, etc.
As stated above, the main beneficiaries will be farmers whose incomes rise by participating in the replication program. For each
village, the number of families benefiting from the replication program will increase as years go on. Simulation results show that,
assuming each household receives project support only for half (0.5) hectare, up to 128 - 368 households (depending on the farning
system chosen) will have received project support five years after the initial "pioneer farmer" testing started in each village. Since
there are 178 households on average in a project village, a vast majority of the farmers in each village will have benefited directly
from the testing/replication program after five years. Because the average size of land controlled by household is 1.82 ha in
Bengkulu, it is expected that many farmers will re-apply to the replication program after the first one ha.



Page 24
Assumptions
Since it is not possible to foresee how many hectares will come under each of the four identified farming systems, due to the
programmatic/participatory nature of the project, assumptions were made on these areas based on existing information about agro-
climatic conditions, current farming practices, and the information on interests of farmers collected during field visits. It is assumed
that the oil palm/groundnuts system will cover 40 percent of the total area to be covered by the testing/replication program,
coffee/groundnuts 30 percent, fruit trees/maize 20 percent, and rice/fish 10 percent. For the purposes of financial/economic analysis,
it is assumed that 80 percent of the farmers borrowing from the revolving fund will repay each year.
Farmgate prices in economic terms for coffee beans (robusta), maize, groundnuts, rice, urea, TSP, muriate of potash and rock
phosphate were derived from the Bank's short and long-term projections (Commodity Markets and the Developing Countries, May
1997). In consideration of the general unemployment/underemployment levels in the region, a conversion rate of 0.9 was used to
calculate the shadow wage rate.
With the new technology packages, the yields are assumed to be the following:
(a) oil palm/groundnuts: 22 tons ffb/ha for oil palm at full maturity; 1,600 - 1,300 kg/ha for groundnuts during years one -
three. (Without project: 10 tons ffb/ha for oil palm at full maturity; 1,600 - 800 kg/ha for groundnuts during years one -
two.)
(b) coffee/groundnuts: 1,800 kg/ha for coffee at full maturity; 1,750 kg/ha for groundnuts the first year. (Without project:
1,500 kg/ha for coffee at full maturity; no annual crops.)
(c) fruit trees/maize: 3,000 kg/ha for durian at full maturity; 5,000 - 2,000 kg/ha for maize during years one - three. (Without
project: 1,500 kg/ha for durian at full maturity; 2,500 - 1,000 kg/ha for maize during years one-three.)
(d) rice/fish combination: 6,000 kg/ha for rice; 1,560 kg/ha for fish over two seasons in a year. (Without project:
4,000 kg/ha for rice; 1,000 kg/ha for fish.)
(e) rice/fish rotation: 3,000 kg/ha for rice; 900 kg/ha for fish over two seasons in a year. (Without project:
2,000 kg/ha for rice; 800 kg/ha for fish.)
The assumed project life is 20 years.
Farm Budgets
Detailed farm budgets were constructed for each of the four identified farning systems, to examine cash flows to farmers, various
financing scenarios, requirements/availability of family labor, etc. They are included in the Project Implementation Plan.
While tree crop systems are generally prone to cash flow problems due to long gestation periods, these problems will be alleviated
substantially under the technology packages proposed, through: (a) inter-cropping with annual crops, which will generate cash income
in the early years before canopy closes; (b) adoption of relatively low-cost technologies; and (c) provision of four-year loans with
grace periods of six or fifteen months.
The labor requirements/availability analysis shows that the demands on family labor will be higher at the start-up stage, and for
tree crops when the trees are fully mature and productive. For tree crop-based systems, 39 - 50 percent of family labor in a typical
farming household (175 to 225 work days per year) will be necessary to start the new technology on one hectare of land, mainly for
land clearing, land preparation, and planting of seedlings. If more labor is available, a farmer will be interested in re-applying for
project support. Labor requirements will start to grow after the tree stands mature; for one hectare with fully-matured tree stands, the
coffee/maize system would need 200 work days of labor per year, and 120 work days for oil palm/groundnuts. (It should be noted
that available family labor should grow over time.)

Results of Economic Analvsis
By using increased farm incomes as the project benefit and including all project costs (including overheads), the project's ERR is
estimated at 19.4 percent. The detailed tables for net incremental returns, etc. are included in the Project Implementation Plan.
Economic benefits of the Village Infrastructure Component have not been estimated for the cost-benefit analysis, for two
reasons. First, it is not clear (less so than the case of agricultural activities) as to which types of village infrastructure will be selected
in how many villages, due to the project's programmatic and participatory nature. The level of economic benefits would vary widely
among such infrastructure investments as village roads, water supply facilities and coffee drying floors, and without a reasonably
reliable forecast of how much of each investment will be selected, an estimate of economic benefits from the component would not be
very meaningful. Second, since the project deals with investments at the level of villages, which are widely dispersed geographically,
there is a scarcity of data needed to estimate economic benefits (e.g., transport volume between project villages).
Meanwhile, the SAR for the Second Village Infrastructure Project (Report No. 15467-IND) estimates an ERR of about 20
percent for the project. It also states that a simulation of village road improvement resulted in an ERR of up to 200 percent (with a
median of about 50 percent ), and that water supply improvements have rates of return exceeding 20 percent. It may therefore be said
that the ERR for the Village Infrastructure Component should not be far off.
By treating the Village Infrastructure Component as a separate project and excluding its cost from the project cost, the ERR for
the project would increase substantially to 31.1 percent.
By assuming that the Village Infrastructure Component has an ERR of 20.0 percent (as with the Second Village Infrastructure
Project - see above), the combined ERR for the whole project will rise slightly to 19.6 percent.
Sensitivity Analysis and Switching Values
T'he main project risks identified in Annex 1 (timnely disbursement of village grants, assignment of qualified staff, timely
appointment of TA consultants, sustainable management of revolving funds) can lead to three types of negative impacts on the
project's economic viability: higher project cost; lower level of benefits; and delays in benefits.
First on the project cost, a 10 percent increase will lower the ERR to 17.0 percent, and a 20 percent increase to an ERR of 15.0
percent. The project cost will have to rise by 52 percent, for the ERR to fall to 10 percent.
Second, on lower project benefits, a 10 percent decrease will lower the ERR to 16.8 percent, and a 20 percent decrease to an ERR
of 14.0 percent. The project benefits will have to fall by 35 percent, for the ERR to fall to 10 percent.
Third, on the delays in project benefits, a one-year delay will reduce the ERR to 15.3 percent, and a two-year delay to 12.2
percent. Project benefits will have to be delayed by nearly three years, for the ERR to fall to 10 percent.
The programmatic nature of the project makes it difficult to estimate the effect of international commodity price fluctuations on
the project's economic returns. If we conduct simulations on the basis of the assumed areas under adopted farming systems described
above, price of coffee would be a good variable to use, since its breakdown of the f.o.b. price structure is well known, and also
because it is assumed to be one of the major crops to be supported under the project. If world coffee prices fall by 10 percent from
the Bank's long-term projection prices throughout the project period of 20 years (a highly unlikely scenario), the ERR will fall to 17.9
percent. With a 20 percent fall, the ERR will fall to 16.4 percent.
The results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below. The results show that the project can sustain significant increases in
cost, delays in benefits and world price deterioration, without compromising its economic viability.

Further, a sensitivity analysis using lower exchange rates for the Rupiah was undertaken, in view of the Rupiah's sharp
depreciation which coincided with the project's appraisal and loan negotiations. Depreciation of the Rupiah would generally improve
the project's ERR, since it would raise the border prices in local currency of exported crops such as coffee, and as most (81 percent)
of the project cost items are local currency costs. Assuming for simplicity that costs of imported items rise in proportion to the rate
with which Rupiah depreciates from the base (appraisal) rate of US$ I = Rp. 3,000, the project's ERR at the exchange rates of US$ 1
= Rp. 4,000, US$ I = Rp. 6,000 and US$1 = Rp 8,000 are 23.4 percent, 30.5 percent and 36.1 percent, respectively. These values
are significantly higher than the base case ERR of 19.4 percent, and suggest that lower exchange rates for the Rupiah would improve
the economic viability of the project.
Fiscal Impact
Impact on Expenditures
In consideration of the Bengkulu governments' low revenue base and their limited capacity to contribute funds toward the project,
efforts have been made to keep the project cost as low as possible without compromising project performance. The loan will finance
79.6 percent of the total project cost.
Of the GOI counterpart funds amounting to US$ 2.6 million (10.0 percent of the project cost), all is contributed from APBD,
through Inpres PPWT Level I ( a central government grant allocated to provincial governments for regional development) and
Level II.
Impact on Revenues
The project will not generate direct revenues for the government. The project will have some indirect impact on the revenues, by
raising the general level of rural economic activity, and hence increasing local tax/levy revenues (e.g., value added tax on assorted
agricultural and non-agricultural commodities).
While the level of expenditures to be borne by the provincial and local governments are not too significant as described above,
increases in regional revenues would enhance the project's financial sustainability. GOI has been considering ways to augment
regional revenues.

Bengkulu Regional Development Project
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement of works and goods will follow the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated
January 1995, which were revised in January/August 1996. Standard Bidding Documents will be used for all Bank-financed
procurement. Employment of consultants and the format for consultants' contracts will be based on the "Guidelines for
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" of January 1997, as revised in September 1997. The
procurement methods to be used for the project are indicated in Table A of this Annex.
Since all procurement under the project will be conducted by the provincial and district governments of Bengkulu, which
have limited experience with procurement under Bank loans, the TA consultants for Capacity Building/Implementation
Support will assist with the procurement.
Procurement Methods (Table A)
Goods, Works and Services under Village Grants (US$ 15.5 million). Village grants, to be provided by GOI to the
project villages, will account for about 60 percent of the total project cost, and will be used by the villages (LKMDs) to
implement the civil works and agricultural testing/replication activities, basically following the VIP procedures. The grant
will be financed 100 percent under the loan to prevent disbursement delays which are inevitable when combining loan funds
with regional government funds. The 100 percent loan financing is possible because there will be no taxes on goods, works
and services to be procured by the villages, as long as the project activities are implemented by the LKMDs themselves,
based on the Government Regulation No. 42/1995 and others.
For civil works under the Village Infrastructure Component, the LKMDs will carry them out oy direct village labor
(community participation) under Village Implementation Agreements (SPPB) with a Pimpro in each Dinas PU Level II. The
LKMDs may also procure supplies of materials, following National Shopping procedures, but may not procure small works
since a Value Added Tax will be levied on the contract. Simplified implementation agreements and documentation for
National Shopping, agreed and used under the VIP, will be used for the Bengkulu project as well and included in the
Technical Guidelines for Project Implementation. The Field Engineers will assist the LKMDs in: (a) organizing village
labor; (b) hiring equipment; and (c) purchasing materials/tools.
For the testing/replication of agricultural technologies to be conducted under the Village-Based Technology Adoption
Component, basically the same approach to procurement will be applied, with the notable difference that the Pimpro will be
at each BIPP. Based on the Village Action Plan reviewed by the BPP concerned, the LKMDs (or the farmers themselves
through fund allocation by LKMD) will use the village grant to purchase agricultural inputs (mainly seedlings, seeds,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, tools, wild pig snares) following National Shopping procedures, to be detailed in the
General Guidelines for Project Implementation (juklak). The LKMDs are not allowed to contract the testing/replication
program to other parties, as participatory and demand-driven management of the program is considered a key element of the
project.
Consulting Services (US$ 2.7 million). There will be three consulting services packages to be procured under the
project. The two relatively large packages to be contracted to consulting firms will be procured on the basis of a short list to
be agreed with the Bank, after advertisement in Development Business. One is the technical assistance for Capacity
Building/Implementation Support, which would include the community development facilitators (see below), beneficiary
surveys and PRA trainers (total estimated cost: US$ 1.2 million). The PRA trainers may be sub-contracted to qualified
NGOs and other groups.
The second package is for the Field Engineers. Firms are not allowed to be party to both of the technical assistance
packages. The estimated cost of the package is US$ 1.4 million.
The third package is for an individual consultant who will be assigned to assist the Project Secretariat at the central level,
to be located in BANGDA for a total of 48 months. The estimated cost of the package is US$ 78,000.



Page 29
Service Delivery Contractors (US$1. Imillion). The 32 community development facilitators or the pendamping (totaling
US$1.1 million), who will: be sub-contracted by the TA consultants for Capacity Building/Implementation Support, will be
appointed as "service delivery contractors" under the Bank's Guidelines of January 1997. They will be recruited locally
based on agreed criteria, for a duration of 3.5 years each.
Service Contracts for Agricultural Support Activities (US$0.6 million). There is one large package and several small
ones to be procured as service contracts. The largest is for the packaging, testing and monitoring of new agricultural
technologies by INPPTP: BAPPEDA Level I would cause INPPTP to cany out the services under a contract to be entered
into between the two agencies (cost estimated at US$ 564,000). Contracting out of research-related activities to a public
institution has been done under the First and Second Agricultural Research Management Projects, both Bank-financed. For
the Bengkulu project, this approach will be used so that GOI counterpart funds can come from the same source as for all the
other project activities (Inpres PPW), which would facilitate planning, budgeting and monitoring. The other contracts will be
for two small pilot private sector participation schemes in partnership with the government extension service, for coffee and
rubber (US$ 29,000 each), as well as smaller contracts for newspaper articles and radio spots to disseminate project-related
information.
Training (US$ 0.3 million). Training will be conducted through GOI procedures acceptable to the Bank, by the
BAPPEDA, Dinas PU Level I and BIPP offices concerned.
Goods (US$ 0.3 million). This category includes equipment and furniture to be procured by the BAPPEDAs, PMD,
BIPPs and BPPs, as well as agricultural inputs to be procured by the Dinas Tree Crops' Rubber Nursery in North Bengkulu
and Dinas Food Crops for annual crop seed production. Due to the small size of the packages, NCB procurement is not
expected, except when the implementing agencies decide to lump small packages together to arrive at a contract at or above
US$50,000. Contracts of less than US$50,000 will be procured through National Shopping procedures.
Civil works (US$ 0.2 million). Civil works would be procured by BAPPEDA Level I and the BIPPs concerned. Due to
the small size of the packages, NCB procurement is not expected, except when the implementing agencies decide to lump
small packages together to arrive at a contract at or above US$50,000. Contracts of less than US$50,000 will be procured
through National Shopping procedures.
Vehicles (US$ 0.5 million). GOI will provide the vehicles for the project under their own procedures, in accordance with
the schedule agreed with the Bank.
Prior Review Thresholds (Table B)
Table B of this Annex indicates the thresholds for prior review. For procurement under the village grants, given the small
amounts of contracts and their large number, as well as the built-in safeguards (Field Engiiieers, the TA consultants for
Capacity Building/Implementation Support, Bank supervision), only the first contract in each of the ten clusters of the "first
batch" villages (total of 40 villages) at or above US$5,000 equivalent will be subject to prior review. Ex-post review of
documentation on a sampling basis will cover 20 percent of the value of the village grants during PYI-2; the percentage may
be lowered to 10 percent starting PY3 depending on supervision results.
Prior review for selection of consultants will follow the Bank's Guidelines of January 1997, which requires contracts for
consulting firms valued at or above US$ 100,000 and contracts with individual contracts at or above US$ 50,000 be subject
to prior review. This means that all three TA packages will be subject to prior review.
Contracts for goods and civil works equivalent to or above US$ 100,000 will be subject to prior review.
Procurement Plan (Table D)
The procurement plan for the project is attached as Table D of this Annex.
Disbursement
Allocation of Loan Proceeds. The allocation of loan proceeds is shown in Table C of this Annex.



Page 30
Disbursement of Village Grants at Local Level. For the Village Infrastructure Component, VIP disbursement procedures
will be used at the local level. For cost efficiency reasons, the project will pay for outputs (itemized works) against measured
progress and prorated lump-sum contracts. Village Implementation Agreements (grant contracts) will be signed between the
LKMD and the component's Pimpro at Dinas PU Level II. Grant disbursements would be based on the LKMD's reports of
work progress and use of funds, certified by the Field Engineers, and submitted to the Pimpro who will in turn forward the
original to the respective Treasury Office (KPKN) of the Ministry of Finance. KPKN will transfer the funds to the LKMD's
account at the closest Operational Bank branch. The LKMD will then withdraw funds from the bank branch when
presenting their request, certified by the Field Engineer, according to progress of works. Evidence of expenditures, records
of labor paid for, and invoices of materials procured will be kept at the village.
Disbursement of the village grant under the Village-Based Technology Adoption Component will be basically the same as
the above, except that certification will be done by BPP/PPs instead of the Field Engineers. Grant disbursements will be
based on LKMD's reports on testing/replication activities and use of funds, certified by BPP/PPs.
Special Account. In order to facilitate loan disbursements, and reduce the volume of withdrawal applications, GOI will
establish a Special Account at Bank Indonesia, to be maintained in US dollars. The authorized ceiling for the account
(equivalent to four-months average project disbursements) will be US$ 1.2 million. The account will be managed by the
Directorate General of Budget, Ministry of Finance. Replenishment of the account will be made on a monthly basis, or when
20 percent of the authorized ceiling has been disbursed, whichever is earlier.
Use of Statement ofExpenditures (SOEs). Disbursements will be against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) for: civil
works, goods and service contracts less than US$100,000 equivalent; contracts with individual consultants and service
delivery contractors less than US$50,000 equivalent; contracts with consulting firms less than US$100,000; all training; and
procurement of goods, works and services under village grants, except for the first procurement of goods, services or works
in each of the first ten clusters of Participating Villages, costing US$5,000 equivalent or more. Documentation for these
expenditures would be retained by the implementing agencies, and made available to the Bank on request. All other
disbursements from the loan will be fully documented.

Annex 7
Financial Reporting and Auditing Framework
Internal Control Framework
The Internal Control (IC) framework for the Bengkulu Regional Development Project (BRDP) consists of project
management policies and procedures. It would follow the existing government internal control system, which is basically satisfactory
to the Bank. The IC structure comprises three elements: (a) organization (institutional framework); (b) accounting system; and (c)
control procedures.
The existing government IC system is deemed adequate, based on the following factors:
*  Accounting system.
*  Organizational structure (institutional framework).
*  Practices pertaining to the delegation of authority and responsibility, including job description.
*  Management control methods, including intemal auditing, budgeting, variance analysis and forecasting.
*  Enforcement policies.
*  Authorized execution of transaction.
*  Limited access to assets.
*  Comparison of recorded amounts with assets in existence.
*  Trained, competent personnel.
- Segregation of staff functions in ways which prevent staff from perpetrating or concealing errors and irregularities.
Under the project, the concept of transparency would be emphasized, particularly at the village level (towards LKMDs,
villagers, etc.), as part of the IC.
Organization
Each implementing unit would have a Pimpro (Project Manager) and a Bendaharawan (treasurer). They would have some
assistance (as necessary) on procurement, and technical and financial matters. The standard requirements for a Pimpro are as follows:
*  Staff of implementing unit.
*  Competence
*  Sarjana Degree
*  Minimum staff level (echelon) IllIc for Pimpro (III/a for Pimbagpro if any)
*  Having a Project Management Certificate or equivalent.
*  Two years' working experience with govermnent projects
The standard requirements for a treasurer are as follows:
*  Staff of implementing unit
*  Competence
*  D III Degree
*  Minimum staff level 11/c
*  Having treasury (bendaharawan) certificate or equivalent.
* One year working experience in government projects
The project's implementing agencies would train their staff (as necessary), to fulfill the requirements. They should fulfill the
requirements from the beginning of the project. All government implementing agencies have adequate capacity, except for BIPP for
which on-the-job training would be provided under the TA for Capacity Building/ Implementation Support.
Accounting System and Procedures
The general accounting system and procedures would follow government accounting system which is in line with the
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The existing government accounting system is satisfactory to the Bank. In
addition, specific project accounting system and procedures would be spelled out in the Guidelines for Project Implementation (jukiak



Page 36
and juknis). The Guidelines should be available in each LKMD/village implementation team for reference. If a village
implementation team encounters difficulties even after referring to the Guidelines, the Field Engineer (FE) and/or the community
development facilitator (pendamping) concerned would assist the villagers and explain how the problem can be addressed.
The project's financial statement should show the financial position of BRDP at the end of fiscal year, and the funds received
and expended during the fiscal year which ends on March 31. The financial statement should be prepared in accordance with GAAP,
and should include a Project Account (PA) report and a Special Account/Statement of Expenditures (SA/SOE). Each Project
Implementing Unit (PIU, namely the Pimpro and the Treasurer) will prepare the PA report. The DG Budget, MOF would prepare the
SA/SOE report.
The PA report should include:
*  Summary of funds received from the Bank, other donors and the govermment's counterpart fund sources separately.
*  Summary of expenditures shown under the project, broken down by project component and expenditure categories (see
below), both for the current fiscal year and cumulative.
The PIUs will use the consolidated PA format (attached to the Project Implementation Plan).
The SA/SOE should include:
*  Deposits and replenishments received from the Bank.
*  Withdrawals from SA and other sources, including all SOEs used as the basis for the submission of withdrawal
application.
*  The remaining balances at the end of each fiscal year.
e  Reconciliation between SA and amount being disbursed.
SA/SOE report would use a format developed and conveyed to DG Budget on June 8, 1992.
Financial Management and Reporting Requirements under the Project
Each implementing agency, including the LKMD, would establish and maintain an adequate and separate account from the
beginning of project implementation. The LKMD would prepare a progress report, including a financial report, and submit it to the
Pimpros in the Kabupaten on the second week of the fourth month. The FEs would assist LKMDs in preparing the financial report.
Reports on the Village-Based Adoption of Agricultural Technologies (VBAAT) component should be furnished to the BIPP Pimpros;
reports on the Village Infrastructures (VI) component to the Pimpro at Dinas PU Level II.
All Pimpros would prepare quarterly progress reports, which are consolidated from reports prepared by LKMD and other
sources. All reports from BANGDA, BAPPEDA Levels I/II, BIPP, and DPU Levels I and II would be submitted to Pimpro in
BAPPEDA Level I on the third week of the fourth month. This report would be consolidated with other components by Pimpro in
BAPPEDA Level I, who would submit the consolidated report to the Bank on the last week of the fourth month. The consolidated
financial report would be submitted to the Financial and Development Supervisory Board (BPKP) or other qualified auditors
acceptable to the Bank for audit.
Audit Requirements
The implementing agencies concerned are required under the BRDP to:
a) maintain records and accounts to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the operations, resources and
expenditures in respect of the activities for which they are responsible for implementation.
b) have these records and accounts audited for each fiscal year, to include disbursements made under the project during the
period.
c) furnish audit reports to the Bank as soon as available, but in any case no later than six months after the end of each fiscal
year.
The specific audit requirement are as described below:
a) DG Budget, MOF would be responsible for preparing financial statements for the Special Account. DG Budget should
furnish to the Bank an SA/SOE audit report, not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year (by September 30
of each year).



Page 37
b) Pimpro in BAPPEDA Level I would be responsible for producing consolidated project reports, as well as progress
reports, on a quarterly basis. The Pimpro should furnish to the Bank a consolidated PA audit report not later than 6
months after the end of each fiscal year (by September 30, 1997)
A financial statement, including the PA and SA/SOE, would be audited annually by the auditor. The financial statements
would be audited by BPKP in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Draft of Term of Reference (TOR) of the audit
program is attached to the Project Implementation Plan.
Beside the annual audit, the Bank would conduct ex-post reviews of all documents based on random sampling during
supervision missions.
