MALE AIRPORT UPGRADING PROJECT
(Cr. 2143-MAL)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the MaIl Airport
Upgrading Project for which Cr. 2143-MAL in the amount of SDR 5.9 million (US$7.5 million
equivalent) was approved on July 11, 1990 and made effective on October 4, 1990.
The Credit was closed on December 31, 1994, after a one year extension of the
original closing date. Final disbursement took place in December, 1994, and the balance of
SDR 155,059 (about US$ 240,000 equivalent) was canceled. Cofinancing was provided by the
Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED) for US$8.5 million, Organization for
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for US$2.0 million and the Islamic Development Bank
(IDB) for US$3.0 million.
The ICR was prepared by Messrs. Mihkel Sergo, Senior Financial Analyst, and
Ritin Singh, Consultant, Energy and Project Finance Division, Country Department I, South Asia
Region. It has been reviewed by Messrs. Per Ljung, Chief, Energy and Project Finance Division
and Mr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, Project Adviser, Country Department I, South Asia Region. The
Borrower's comments and evaluation (Appendix "B") have been included in the ICR.
The preparation of this ICR started during the final supervision/completion
mission, January 20-23, 1995. The report is based on the findings of this mission, material in the
project file, the Borrower/Beneficiary's evaluation of the project's execution and comments on
the draft ICR. The cofinanciers were invited to participate in the completion mission and
comment on the draft ICR. No comments were received.

MALE AIRPORT UPGRADING PROJECT
(Cr. 2143-MAL)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
In the mid 1 980s, when wide-bodied aircraft were introduced on the Male routes
and tourist traffic increased faster than predicted, the Government of Maldives (GOM)
recognized the need for upgrading and expanding its airport facilities. Accordingly, the Maldives
Airport Authority (MAA) commissioned a masterplan and presented it to GOM in July 1986.
This plan provided for the extension of the runway and expansion of the terminal building and
aircraft parking areas in phased stages. In July 1990, IDA approved a credit to GOM for SDR 5.9
million (Credit 2143-MAL) to support the implementation of MAA's masterplan. There was no
previous IDA lending for the aviation sub-sector in the Maldives.
Objectives
The principle objective of the project was to improve facilities at the Mal6 airport
to meet the growth in tourist traffic and strengthen MAA's operating capabilities. The physical
and institutional objectives were clear, realistic and consistent with IDA's and GOM's strategy
for the aviation and tourist sub-sector.
Implementation Experience and Results
The project achieved its physical and institutional objectives and in many cases
exceeded them: the airport facilities were upgraded, airport traffic grew much faster than
expected, and MAA was able to satisfactorily handle this quantum growth. MAA's net profits
exceeded appraisal projections by ten times in 1994 and MAA complied with all credit
covenants. Favorable contract prices and the dollar appreciation of IDA's SDR-credit permitted
the expansion of the scope for the runway works. The Credit Agreement was slightly amended
for this purpose. The closing date was extended by one year to enable completion of the project's
institution building component.



The final project cost was US$24.5 million or about 6% below the appraisal
estimate of US$25.95 million. Foreign costs were financed by GOM (US$2.1 million), IDA'
(US$8.1 million), KFAED (US$8.5 million), OPEC (US$2.0 million) and IDB (US$3.0 million).
The very minor local costs (US$0.9 million) were funded by GOM. The physical project
components were completed on schedule. The project's institutional building components were
completed one year late. The reasons for this delay were: unsatisfactory consultants proposals,
the resignation of a management accountant and the Gulf war.
IDA assisted MAA in the preparation of the project, as a part of MAA's least cost
expansion and rehabilitation program. MAA's perfornance during the identification and
preparation stages was highly satisfactory.Only three years was provided for project
implementation and the physical components were completed as scheduled. Risks were
adequately assessed and the overall appraisal of the project was satisfactory . Supervision of the
project was carried out on a regular basis and IDA's as well as MAA's performance were
satisfactory during the project implementation.
The project achieved or surpassed its objectives: the economic internal rate of
return now estimated at 55% compares very favorably with the appraisal estimate of 36%. The
overall assessment of the project is very satisfactory.
Summary of Findings and Key Lessons Learned
MAA has been able to competently handle the quantum leap in airport traffic,
which was well above project appraisal projections. The number of passengers increased by 60%
from 1990 to 1994 to 890,284. Similarly, aircraft movements grew by about 200% to 21,778 and
the amount of cargo handled by 135% during the samne period. MAA' s financial performance
was satisfactory. Provisional accounts for 1994 indicate a net income of Rf.47.0 million, which
compares favorably with the Rf.4.8 million projected. This positive development was a result of
revenues increasing substantially faster than operating costs in the 1990-1994 period, primarily
due to higher airport traffic than forecast. Since January 1994, MAA does not receive
Government funds and generates internally adequate funds for its investments and operations. A
monitorable operational plan has been agreed with MAA.
A main lesson learned is that good project preparation and substantial beneficiary
interest and ownership (MAA in this case) of the project leads to successful project
implementation.
I The actual disbursed amount (US$8.1 million) exceeded the original Credit equivalent of US$7.5 million due to
the strengthening of the SDR against the US$.

Background
I .       MAA operates all airports in the Maldives, but currently the Male International Airport
constitutes practically its entire activity. The airport was constructed between 1978 and 1981 to
Boeing 707 type aircraft standards. While some of the airport facilities were in good condition by
the mid- 1980s, others were in urgent need of repair and upgrading. The deficiencies were related in
part to the increasing use of heavy, wide-body aircrafts for which the airport was not designed and
which caused more rapid deterioration of the runway.
2.        To enable the airport to meet projected traffic, a master plan for the airport upgrading
and expansion was completed in July 1986. This plan provided the basis for preparing an
investment package aimed at correcting critical deficiencies hampering efficient and safe operations
of the airport facilities. If left unimproved, operating conditions for large aircrafts would eventually
have become unacceptable, which in turn would have threatened the viability of the tourism
industry. GOM sought financing from several sources. In 1987, a financing plan was worked out
based on contributions from the KFAED, OPEC, and other financiers. This financing plan did not
materialize, however, and the project implementation was delayed. In early 1989, GOM requested
IDA to participate in the financing of the project.
3.        An identification/preparation mission visited Maldives in April 1989, followed by a co-
financiers meeting/preappraisal mission in November 1989. The project was appraised in February
1990 and the Credit was approved by IDA's Board on May 29, 1990. The Credit and Project
Agreements were signed on July 11, 1990 and the Credit was declared effective on October



2
4, 1990. The Credit closing date was extended by one year, to December 31, 1994, at which time
the Credit was closed and about US$ 240,000 was later canceled.
A. Evaluation of Objectives
4.        PrQject Objectives The principal objective of the project was to enable the continued
growth of Maldives key economic sector - tourism - through improvements at the Maid airport,
upon which the industry is critically dependent. In physical terms, the objectives were to: (i) meet
immediate and urgent airport operating requirements; and (ii) ensure that the airport's facilities
could handle the traffic levels expected for the medium term. These objectives were clear, realistic
and consistent with GOM's strategy for the aviation sub-sector. The project was well designed to
meet these objectives and within MAA's implementing capability. The project successfully
achieved its sectoral, physical, financial and institutional development objectives.
5.        Project Description The project consisted of the following components:
(a) Runway rehabilitation and extension: existing 2,840 m runway extended to 3,200 m,
stabilization, reconstruction and rehabilitation of existing runway surface, and
rebuilding of runway shoulders at the extended area of the runway;
(b) Reconstruction of aircraft turning pads: construction at both ends of the runway
designed to allow a reasonable turning radius for B747-type aircraft;
(c) Aircraft parking apron: 160x75 m extension to the south of existing parking apron and
concrete drains to intercept rainwater;
(d) Island shore protection works: installation of heavy-duty steel sheet piles at the airport
island, including the harbor complex;
(e) Modification of terminal complex: extension and modification of passenger handling
facilities, improvements to the potable water supply (e.g. piping and plumbing system),
desalination equipment, replacement of sewage system, and installation of sewage
plant;
(f) Navigation aids: installation of instrument landing system (ILS), approach lighting
and airfield lighting;
(g) Power supply: installation of two 500 kw diesel generators;
(h) Airport safety: procurement of one large fire-fighting vehicle; and
(i) Technical assistance and training for MAA: consulting services to upgrade
accounting, financial and management information systems, implementation of
accounting system and staff training programs.

B. Achievement of Obbjectives
6.        Sectoral Objectives At the time of project appraisal, GOM's objective was to
support the continued growth of the tourist industry, which had become the most important
sector of the economy. MAA's primary strategy, therefore, was to remedy the critical
deficiencies at Male international airport to safeguard the viability and growth potential of the
tourism industry. Due to good project management, the upgrading of the airport facilities was
completed on schedule and airport traffic grew substantially faster than projected. Favorable
contract prices and the dollar appreciation of IDA's SDR-credit permitted the expansion of the
scope for the runway works. The Credit Agreement was slightly amended for this purpose. The
project made possible direct flights from tourist generating countries to Male and greatly
facilitated the growth in tourist arrivals.
7.        Financial Obiectives MAA's financial performance vastly exceeded appraisal
expectations. Provisional accounts for 1994 indicate a net income (before Rf 15.0 million
dividend to Government) of Rf 47.0 million, which compares very favorably with the Rf. 4.8
million projected for 1994. Similarly, MAA's budget for 1995 indicates a net income of Rf 57.0
million against project appraisal projections of Rf 6.4 million. This positive development was a
result of a revenues, mainly consisting of traffic, ground handling, fuel sales and other revenues,
increasing substantially faster than operating costs in the 1990-1994 project period than forecast.
As a consequence, MAA's operating ratio in 1994 was only 68% against an appraisal estimate of
86% and its return on net fixed assets in operation 22% against appraisal estimates of 3%.
MAA's net internal cash generation also improved significantly during the project period and
was estimated at about US$6.0 million for 1994 after transfers to GOM. Since January 1994,
MAA generates internally (after dividends to GOM) adequate funds for its investments and
operations and does not receive Government funds.
8.       Institutional Development Objectives GOM realized the need to strengthen MAA,
and supported organizational measures and extensive training of MAA personnel. In January
1994, a seven member Board of Directors was appointed for MAA. This Board completed the
drafting of MAA's Articles of Association in October, 1994. The registration of these Articles of
Association and the completion of other legal formalities will convert MAA into a more
independent corporate body under the law of limited liability companies. This process is
expected to be completed during the second half of 1995. MAA's financial operations are
separate from the GOM accounts and it has been given adequate autonomy over its cash flow and
investment decisions.
9.        MAA's capability to plan, design, construct and maintain its airport facilities
improved under the project. Moreover, technical assistance helped to introduce a new commercial
accounting system and management information system (MIS). The recruitment of a management
accountant and staff training programs have strengthened MAA's administration considerably. The
institutional development component was completed a year behind schedule. The main reason
was the time needed to recruit an international consulting firm to design the new systems.
Further, a management accountant recruited to implement the system resigned and the



4
replacement took time. Finally, implementation was further delayed as a result of the Gulf war,
as MAA had to focus on ensuring continued funding to complete the physical components of the
project.
10.      The main physical project components (para. 5 above) were completed on schedule:
navigation aids, March 1991; apron extension, turning pads, runway, June 1992; generators, July
1992; and fire fighting equipment, September 1993.
11.       Economic Analysis The economic rate of return (ERR) was recalculated basically
using the same approach as in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), i.e. estimating the difference in
cash flows with and without the project. GOM's fiscal benefits (1995 values) were estimated at
US$122 equivalent per incremental tourist (bed tax US$6 times nine nights, airport tax US$10,
lease income US$31 and import duty US$27). MAA's incremental net revenue (operating income
before depreciation) and the Tourist Ministry expenditures were also included. The resulting net
incremental cash flow in US$ was adjusted for the US consumer price index to base the ERR
calculations on values expressed in 1995 purchasing power. The resulting ERR is 55%, which
compares very favorably with the appraisal estimate of 36%.
12.      The above ERR of 55% should be considered a minimum estimate as it is based on
conservative assumptions and ignores benefits that are difficult to quantify, e.g.:
(a) salaries etc. for staff working in the tourist industry as a result of the growth made
possible by the upgrading of the airport;
(b) as from 1995, a five percent annual increase in the number of tourists has been
assumed - much less than experienced in recent years; and
(c) the runway was completed in June 1992, which facilitated the substantial increase in
air traffic and tourism experienced during the second half of this year. Only 50% of
this 1992 increase has been included among incremental benefits.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
13.       Project Cost and Financing The project cost of US$24.5 million was about 6% below
the projected cost of US$25.95 million. Works and equipment were exempt from import duties
and taxes. The foreign cost component was US$23.6 million, financed by GOM (US$2.0
million), IDA (US$8.1 million), KFAED (US$8.5 million), OPEC (US$2.0 million) and IDB
(US$3.0 million). The appraisal estimates and final project cost and financing plan are shown in
Part II, Tables 8A and 8B.
14.      Project Implementation The project completion date was December 31, 1993.
However, due to the reasons cited above (para. 9), the institution building component was
completed only by December 31, 1994. The estimated and actual disbursement of the IDA Credit
are shown in Part II, Table 4. The original Credit closing date of December 31, 1993, was
extended once to December 31, 1994. US$8.1 million equivalent of the Credit had been



5
disbursed by December 31, 1994 and an outstanding balance of about US$240,000 equivalent
was later canceled.
15.       Environment No major environmental issues were identified at appraisal of the
project, as it consisted of rehabilitation/upgrading of existing facilities. The environmental
concerns, arising from both airport operation and construction activities during project
implementation, were related to the limited quantities of sweet water on the airport island and the
safeguarding of neighboring coral reefs. These issues were addressed through design solutions
which provided for the prevention of contamination of the groundwater and coral reef and stone.
Potential construction hazards were addressed by requiring environmentally sound work practices
in the contract documents. Compliance with these provisions were carefully monitored during
implementation. In retrospect, the project should also have included a sewage treatment plant.
MAA is currently addressing the possible environmental hazards due to sewage being discharged
untreated into the sea outside the airport.
D. Project Sustainability
16.       MAA's operations and benefits achieved under the project will be sustained. Male has
already experienced a marked growth in tourist traffic between 1990-1994 and the growth is
expected to continue. MAA's operational plan anticipates passenger arrivals, airport traffic and
aircraft movement to increase by an average of 5% p.a. upto 2000. The conversion of MAA into a
more autonomous entity, staff training programs, future investment plans, and satisfactory financial
performance should also ensure continued efficient operations and profitability.
E. IDA's Performance
17.       Project Preparation During the November 1989 pre-appraisal, IDA reduced the scope
of the project and made it more technically and financially feasible. Based on detailed
engineering designs, IDA reduced the project cost from a proposed US42.0 million to about
US$25.0 million. An investment program was worked out with GOM and the co-financiers,
primarily consisting of the terminal building, runway and apron extensions. The financing plan
agreed on at the co-financiers meeting provided for IDA to finance the runway extension. For
supervising the works of the various project components, IDA utilized the consultant who
prepared the master plan and detailed engineering. This was a prudent decision, since the
consultant had performed satisfactorily and had intimate knowledge of the special conditions
existing at the coral island on which the airport is located. Technical, financial, economic,
institutional and environmental aspects were also reviewed and suitable components included in
the project as judged necessary. Although organic waste generally is not considered a serious
environmental hazard, the project should also have included a sewage treatment plant. On the
whole, however, IDA's performance in the project preparation was satisfactory.



6
18.      Project Appraisal The project was appraised in February 1990 by an economist, an
engineer and a financial analyst. The staff mix of the appraisal mission and the time spent on
appraisal were adequate. IDA also confirmed the commitment of GOM and MAA towards the
project's objectives during appraisal. The project was a part of MAA's least cost development
program and both GOM and MAA were fully committed to it. MAA's project implementing
capacity was also reviewed and it was agreed that MAA would require some technical assistance
and staff training for its institutional development and to establish a new commercial accounting
system. Necessary provisions were, therefore, made in the project to provide suitable technical
assistance and training. The financial package and co-financing arrangements were appropriate.
Overall, IDA's appraisal of the project was satisfactory.
19.      Project Supervision MAA provided IDA with brief (maximum four pages) monthly
progress reports by fax and this was very effective in keeping IDA up-to-date. It also proved
invaluable for the quick actions needed to keep the airport operating during project
implementation. The project was also regularly supervised by IDA through eight missions during
project implementation. The skill mix and duration of the missions were appropriate and
recommendations of the missions were diligently implemented by MAA.
20.       Following the Gulf war in August 1990, a co-financiers' meeting was held in IDA's
London office to evaluate the situation, make changes to the financing plan as necessary and set
project implementation back on track. The meeting agreed that the financing plan should remain
as agreed during appraisal. A Kuwaiti contractor had been awarded a US$5.65 million contract
for the KFAED financed component (soil stabilization for the runway). Works were scheduled to
start in September 1990. Following the Gulf War in August 1990, the contractor lost his main
operating base, equipment and materials. It was important to bring implementation back on track,
since IDA and IDB financed works depended on the soil stabilization for the runway. The
contractor lodged a claim for approximately US$3.5 million as compensation for loss of
equipment and materials. The co-financiers' meeting supported GOM's position that the
contractor delink the completion of the project from any resolution of his claim. While the
contractor agreed to keep the two issues separate, there was a one year delay in the KFAED
financed component. The contractor's claim has now been reduced to about US$1.5 million and
it is still not clear if MAA and/or insurance companies are liable to pay the claim. Despite the
problems caused by the Gulf war, the runway was completed on schedule.
21.       An Dutch consultant was retained to introduce a double entry accounting system.
Unfortunately, this system required sophisticated computers and programmes for which the
MAA staff did not have the necessary skills. IDA proposed that MAA utilize the uncommitted
Credit funds to train its accounting staff. Meanwhile, consulting activities were put on hold,
which resulted in a contract dispute between MAA and the consultant. MAA, with IDA support,
was able to reach a mutually acceptable settlement of this dispute.
22.      IDA displayed suitable flexibility during the execution of the project. All physical
components were completed on schedule and part of the remaining Credit was used to assist in
the completion of MAA's institutional strengthening. Using these remaining funds, MAA

extended the services of the Management Accountant, trained accounting staff, and procured
additional computer hardware and software. Overall, the supervision was carried out in a
satisfactory manner.
F. Performance of Borrower/Beneficiary
23.       Project Implementation MAA closely supervised the implementation of the project
through its Project Implementation Unit. This unit retained adequately competent staff to supervise
and monitor the project. MAA organized suitable staff training programs to ensure that staff had
the critical skills for the proper management and operations of the airport. Most of the training was
undertaken in neighboring countries. Progress reports were prepared in a timely manner and were
adequate for IDA to monitor project performance. Issues identified by IDA supervision missions
were addressed expeditiously. The start up delays caused by the Gulf War were managed
efficiently.
G. Assessment of Outcome
24.       The project achieved its sectoral, financial, physical and institutional objectives and is
project sustainable. The project implementation was timely, its cost below appraisal estimates and
the ERR substantially higher than projected. The overall assessment of the project is very
satisfactory.
H. Future Operation
25.       During the final supervision/implementation completion mission, an operational plan
(Appendix A) was agreed with MAA. Performance indicators projected up to year 2000 provide
for effective monitoring of MAA's operations. The key parameters include passenger arrivals,
airport traffic and aircraft movement. MAA also plans to conduct future need based training
courses to ensure that MAA staff has the critical skills for the proper management and operations
of the airport.
26.       The potential for the tourist industry within a reasonable traveling distance from
Male airport is nearly fully developed. Tourism (bed tax) is Government's main source of
income and, in addition, about 60% of the custom duties are tourist related. To support the
Government's regional development plans and facilitate the growth of tourism in the Southern
archipelago, MAA plans to upgrade three airport facilities in the south. Airport facilities that can
take wide-bodied jets and telecommunications are the main infrastructural requirements for the
development by the private sector of the tourism potential in this region. If so requested by
GOM, IDA should consider continued support for the sector.

I. Key Lessons Learned
27.       Thorough project preparation and substantial borrower/beneficiary interest and
ownership leads to efficient project implementation. The project had a bare minimum of
conditionality and the results indicate that the project objectives can be achieved without strong
conditionality, provided there is ownership and commitment on the part of the borrower and
implementing agency. Project related environmental issues should be studied, even if the project
only aims at upgrading existing facilities.

Table 9: Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
Economic Internal Rate of Return:
Appraisal Estimate: 36%              Actual: 55%
1.   Assumtions.. The ERR estimate is based on the incremental costs and benefits created by the
project and the calculations have been made on the following simplified assumptions:
(a) capital expenditures as reported by MAA;
(b) incremental costs and benefits based on the growth in the number of tourists as from July 1992; the
annual growth as from 1995 has been assumed at 5% in line with MAA's projections for general
airport traffic;
(c) the fiscal benefits to GOM has been estimated at US$122 per tourist, consisting of: US$54.00 in
bed tax (US$6.00 per night times nine nights); US$ 10.00 in airport tax; US$27.00 in lease income
from the resorts; and US$27.00 in custom duties on imports for tourism;
(d) MAA's net cash surplus is based on its financial statements for 1992/1993 and provisional data for
1994;
(e) the costs for the Tourism Ministry was estimated at US$0.6 million for 1994;
(f) the net benefit stream has been adjusted for the US consumer price inflation up to 1995 - thereafter
incremental unit costs and benefits have been assumed to remain constant in real terms.
2.     Based on the above assumptions, the recalculated ERR is 55% against an appraisal estimate of
36%.
3.     The above ERR of 55% should be considered a minimum estimate as it is based on conservative
assumptions and ignores benefits that are difficult to quantify, e.g.:
(a) salaries etc. for staff working in the tourist industry as a result of growth made possible by the
upgrading of the airport;
(b) as from 1995, a five percent annual increase in the number of tourists has been assumed - much less
than experienced in recent years;
(c) the runway was completed in June 1992, which facilitated the substantial increase in air traffic and
tourism experienced for the second half of this year, only 50% of this 1992 increase has been
included among incremental benefits; and
(d) TA costs have been included and net benefits have been adjusted for inflation; this was not done for
the appraisal estimate, so the real ERR exceeds appraisal estimates more than indicated in para. 2
above.

MALDIVES
MALE AIRPORT UPGRADING PROJECT
(Cr. 2143-MAL)
AIDE-MEMOIRE
(Final Supervision Mission - January 1995)
1) A World Bank mission consisting of Messrs. Mihkel Sergo and Ritin Singh visited the
Maldives from January 20 to 23, 1995 for the final supervision of the Male Airport Upgrading
Project (CR 2143 - MAL). Special attention was given to IDA's Implementation Completion
Review (ICR) requirements and work to be carried out by the Male Airport Authority (MAA) on
the ICR. The mission met with officials from the Ministry of Finance and Treasury and MAA. A
list of officials met is attached. The mission expresses its appreciation for all assistance and
courtesies extended to the mission.
2)  This aide memoire summarises the findings and conclusions of the mission and is subject to
confirmation by the Bank's senior management. 
3)     Use of Undisbursed Credit Amount. It was agreed that MAA will use US$30,717 of the
credit funds available in the Special Account to pay for the computer hardware as previously
agreed with IDA and set out in MAA's fax of December 15, 1994 to IDA. Remaining undisbursd
amount will be cancelled once the payment for the computer hardware has been done, but not
later than April 30,1995.
4)     MAA's Financial Performance. Provisional accounts for 1994 indicate a net income
(before Rf 15.0 million dividend to Government) of Rf 47.0 million, which compares very
favourably with the Rf. 4.8 million projected for 1994 at project appraisal. Similarly, MAA's
budget for 1995 indicates a net income of Rf 57.0 million against appraisal projections of Rf 6.4
million. This positive development was caused by revenues increasing substantially faster than
operating costs in the 1990 to 1994 project period, mainly due to higher airport traffic than
projected. As a consequence, MAA's operating ratio in 1994 was only 68% against an appraisal
estimate of 86% and its return on net fixed assets in operation 22% against on appraisal estimate
of 3%. MAA's net internal cash generation also improved substantially during the project period
and was estinated at over US$6.0 million equivalent for 1994. This provides MAA with
adequate funds for its investments and operations, which is essential as MAA, as from January
1994, does not receive funds from the Government.
5)     MAA's Legal Status and Autonomy. A seven member Board of Directors was appointed
for MAA as from January 1 1994. This Board completed the drafting of MAA's Articles of
Association in October 1994. The registration of these Articles of Association and the
completion of other legal fonnalities will convert MAA from a Government Department to a
more independent corporate body under the law for limited liability companies. This process is
expected to be completed by June 1995.
' The conclusions of this aide memoire was iater confirmed by a letter dated February 16, 1995.

Appendix A
page 2 of 8
6)     Project Implementation Completion Review (ICR). Based on the information about
IDA's ICR procedures provided to MAA in April 1994, MAA started to prepare the relevant
data. MAA's operation plan for the project and indicators for future performance were discussed
in detail and agreed on; the resulting operation plan is attached to this aide memoire.
7)     MAA and IDA will continue to co-ordinate the ICR preparation with the objective of
completing a satisfactory draft report by May 1995. For this purpose, MAA will send the Project
Implementation Assessment and relevant statistical tables and appendixes to IDA by the end of
March, 1995. IDA will incorporate the material received from MAA and complete the draft ICR.
This draft will be circulated to MAA and co-financiers for comments. MAA will submit the
report to the Department of External Resources, Ministry of Finance for review prior to
forwarding to IDA.
8)     Proposed Follow-up Project. To support Government's regional development plans and
facilitate the growth of the tourist industry in the Southern archipelago of the Maldives, MAA
plans to upgrade three airport facilities in this region. Plans to upgrade the Gan Airport have
already been developed. Government may ask IDA to support this project.

OPERATION PLAN
Investments outside IDA-Funded Project at the Male Airport
The Saudi and Den Danske Bank funded new Terminal Building, for about US $ 10
million, is expected to be completed by September 1995.
Further, to continue the growth in Airport Traffic achieved over the past 4 years, MAA is
planning additional investments and up-grading of the Mal' Airport as detailed below:
Distance Measuring Equipment[DME] and Doppler Very High
Frequency Omni Range [DVOR] for the Navigation capabilities    US$ 860,000
Two 1000 KVA Genset for Power Generation                  US$ 275,000
Land reclamation and sheet piling to increase
the availability of land                                   US$ 3,200,000
MAA is also planning to increase the storage capacity of the Jet A-I fuel by 5,500 MT
and strengtheni the ground handling and fire fighting capabilities by adding suitable equipment.
Tender formalities have already been initiated.
All the above investmwents at the Aal Airp)ort are going to be made out of MA4 's
internal cash generation (after payment of about US $ 1.5 million annual return to the
Government of Maldives).
Institutional and Financial Performance
As from January 1994 MAA has been operating as an autonomous body and for the
year 1994, MAA is expecting to achieve a net profit of Rf 32 million after declaring a dividend
of Rf 15 million to Government of Maldives. MAA's revenue and net profit is expected to
continue increasing over the next five years.
Manpower Development:
MAA has been organizing training programs as necessary for its staff to acquire the
critical skills required for the proper management and operations of the Airport. Following are a
few examples of training courses provided in 1994..
A weeks program course in Advanced Fire fighting for 10 people in Sri Lanka, a ten

Appendi4 A
page S of 8
days Ramp handling course in Sri Lanka for six people, a 14 weeks program in Aerodrome
Control in Sri Lanka for eight people, an eight weeks Accounts course for ten people conducted
locally.
MAA also plans to conduct future need based training courses to ensure that MAA staff
has the critical skills for the proper management and operations of the Airport. Currently MAA
has 820 staff consisting of Management and Administrative staff 80, Technical staff 269 and
Non Technical & Support staff 471. No increase in staff is expected in the next five years.
Possible Follow-up Project
To promote tourism and other economic activities in the Southern Atolls, Government
plans to upgrade the three Regional Airports namely Gan, Kadhdhoo, Kaadedhdhoo and
Hanimaadhoo. In the case of Gan Airport, it has been estimated that the upgrading would cost
about US $ 12.0 million. Estimates of the cost to upgrade the other three Airports are being
worked out. Government may ask the Bank to support the upgrading of these Airports through a
follow-up project.
Operation Plan
The operation plan for MAA has been is defined by Passenger arrivals, Airport traffic
and Aircraft movement, which are set out in attachment A, B and C. The projection of those
key parameters upto year 2000 will also serve as indicators of MAA's performance.

MALDIVES
MALE AIRPORT UPGRADING PROJECT
(Cr. 2143-MAL)
BORROWER'S EVALUATION
(Prepared by MAA in February-March 1995)
1. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of the project remained valid throughout the implementation and until
now. The tourism industry, while having maintained a healthy growth had also stayed as a major
economic activity. To this end the broad objective of "maintaining the viability and growth
potential of tourism through improvements at Male Airport" had proved to be very important and
critical indeed for the country. The project had stayed on the top ranks of development priorities
of the country and of the MAA throughout its implementation.
However with the addition of a new domestic airport in the country during the implementation
phase, domestic travel by native Maldivians also increased proportionately, increasing the
mobility of people within the country. Therefore increase in population mobility could perhaps
have been an objective of the project, even though the project was only about upgrading of an
existing airport. This is because new services like additional domestic airports, liberalisation of
other modes of transport like sea planes and high speed ferry services to outer atolls inevitably
taxes on the resources of Male International Airport.
The project was implemented smoothly with no major unforeseen demands on either the Project
Implementation Unit/MAA or the Bank. Some changes were made, but were dealt with
promptly.
ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
The objectives in physical terms, of:
a) meeting immediate and urgent Airport operating requirements and
b) bringing the Airport's facilities in line with traffic levels expected to be generated by
the tourist industry in the medium term,
have been broadly achieved, with some exceptions as indicated below.
The rehabilitated and extended runway will suffice for the short to medium term future. However
some constructional and/or design defects have led to asphalt bleeding on several locations along
the runway since completion. The consultants have denied responsibility and the question of
whether to investigate the problem using independent experts is being pondered here. Their
contractual design liability expires in five years from completion.

The extended apron is sufficient for the present but, due to a high increase in aircraft movements
in the last few years it is likely that a further extension will be required soon after the new
Passenger Terminal Building is commissioned.
Although the Passenger Terminal Building construction is on schedule as per the Contract, the
delay in its initially planned commencement has caused some difficulty in the Airport operations
as a result of over-crowding. Once opened, the new facility - with an increased floor area over
that of the original - is expected to be sufficient in capacity in the short-to-medium term future.
Shore protection works have similarly achieved its objectives in protecting and maintaining the
shoreline. However, there had been a marked increase in waves inside the harbour since the
sheetpiling works and, this problem has been resolved to an extent by providing a wave-breaker
pier at the southern entrance to the harbour.
The extended power house proved only sufficient for two years primarily because of increased
Terminal Building area over and above the original plan, coupled with an unexpected demand
generated by new facilities owned by Air Maldives who recently introduced an international
service.
Technical assistance provided by the Bank in the form of a management accountant and
computer hardware contributed greatly to improving MAA's accounting function and, in January
1994 MAA became financially autonomous.
It must be emphasised here that the tourism industry had grown faster than expected resulting in
a higher growth in the short-to-medium term future, than earlier envisaged. The rapid increase in
tourist arrivals (16% in 1994) and in domestic travel has nevertheless proportionately increased
MAA's revenue, thereby achieving the financial objectives very well indeed.
2. DESIGN
Based on the circumstances prevailing at the time of design the project design was appropriate.
The different components when examined separately however, reveals that:
a) the initial Passenger Terminal Building design was undersized. But the area was later
increased sufficiently.
b) the fact that the new sewerage system did not include any treatment prior to its outflow into
the lagoon immediately offshore, poses an environmental hazard. MAA is looking for an
adequate solution to this problem.
c) The design of the shore protection works apparently did not take into account its effect on
ripples/wave formation inside the harbour.
A key lesson learnt here is that co-financing of individual components causes complications in
processing withdrawal applications, since appropriate proportioning to different financiers
needto be done. Instead, multi-component projects requiring co-financing arrangements should
be easier to implement if each of the financiers financed whole individual components.

page 3 of 6
3. IMPLEMENTATION
The implementation was achieved on schedule except for the Passenger Terminal Building
which was delayed due to a delay in securing the financing required for that component. Its
completion is now scheduled for October 1995.
The financial consultants, although appointed on time did not meet MAA and the Bank
performance criteria. Therefore this component had to be discontinued.
The Project Implementation Unit / MAA was responsible as planned, for its implementation
throughout the Project. They were aided by Joint Venture Consultants (Kocks Consult GmbH,
Germany, Flughafen, Frankfurt Main, Germany and fNENGCO, Kuwait.) in the Design and
Supervision. The Project Implementation Unit further undertook the task of managing the project
finances in-so-far as cost control, financial variations during the project, processing of
withdrawal applications and keeping project accounts.
The single most important factor affecting the implementation was the need to schedule the
actual construction activities in the operational areas so as not to hinder operations. This was
however achieved very satisfactorily, through careful programming of the construction activity.
For instance activities on the runway were carried out mostly during night hours when the airport
operations were little or none.
A major milestone occurred during the Iraq-Kuwait war when the contractor for Shore Protection
and Subsoil Stabilisation works allegedly lost plant and equipment worth over 3 million US
Dollars, and subsequently claimed the amount under the contractual clause of Force Majeure.
The claim had been verified by the consultants and the amount certified by the Engineers had
been reduced by half. But the matter has not yet been resolved.
Regardless of these difficulties it can be concluded that the Implementation of this Project
proceeded smoothly and satisfactorily.
4. OPERATION EXPERIENCE
The most critical components affecting the operations, apart from the Passenger Terminal
Building are the Runway and Apron. The extended and overlayed runway, including the
Instrument Landing System and precision approach lighting, is now capable of handling wide-
bodied aircraft (making up 67% of the total aircraft movements) more safely, especially at night.
The Apron, although foreseen to be sufficient for some time into the future when planned,
became congested soon after opening for operations. The nature of operations here i.e., a largely
tourist oriented operation, places a higher demand on Apron, Terminal and Runway capacity,
than that on most other airports of the world. Tourist carrying charter flights all tend to



30
Appendix B
page 4 of 6
concentrate during morning hours and on certain days of the week due to night curfew hours at
European Airports (where most of the traffic originate) and because of a preference by holiday
makers to include week-ends at the beginning and end of their holidays.
This fact puts the ratio of airport capacity over annual revenues high calling for high capital
investment when compared with most other airports. Therefore every effort is being made to
spread this concentration as far as possible. In any event though, the Apron area will become
insufficient very soon1. Its expansion will certainly be justified by the existence of a Passenger
Terminal Building that can accommodate a greater through-put of passengers.
Nevertheless in light of the prevailing conditions when the Project was planned, it can be
concluded that the increased capacity has improved MAA's financial position far better than
expected by generating more revenue. The prospects of return on investment therefore is bright
as indicated in the financial report.
5. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
As outlined in the Staff Appraisal Report, Maldives Airports Authority created the Project
Implementation Unit which was assigned the task of managing the project. Consultants had been
already selected through competitive international tendering prior to the Bank's involvement.
Contracts for Project components of similar nature were grouped together and awarded based
again on international tendering.
In addition, the Government of Maldives formed a high-level committee named Project Co-
ordinating Committee that included members from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Civil
Aviation Department, Ministry of Planning and Environment and the National Airline and MAA.
This committee met to resolve important issues every now and again and were briefed by Project
Implementation Unit on major developments.
The Project Implementation Unit composed of a director assisted by suitable engineers,
procurement officers, project officers and secretaries performed its tasks as required by the Bank
and accepted by MAA. Regular site inspection was carried out by its engineers. Site meetings
were held fortnightly, attended by Project Implementation Unit, Consultants and the main
contractors. Key issues including additions and omissions were discussed and agreed here.
All withdrawal applications and interim reports were processed on time. The Consultants and
Project Implementation Unit prepared and submitted separate reports to the Bank and other co-
financiers regularly.
The Consultants designed and supervised all the components and made available a resident
engineer assisted by experts in different fields of speciality, the only exception being the design
of the Passenger Terminal Building which was undertaken by the Contractor as part of a design-
and-build project, after the Consultants failed to agree with MAA on a modified design brief
requested by MAA as a result of an unexpected increase in passenger movements.



31
Appendix B
page S of 6
The Consultant's performance can be said to be satisfactory except for some areas where it could
be termed deficient. For instance as indicated earlier they failed to agree with MAA's particular
requirements in the sizing of the Passenger Terminal Building. Likewise, during supervision of
the Project it was noted that they did not always fulfil their obligation to safeguard the Client's
interests.
Furthermore the question of whether the defects on the runway was a design and/or supervision
shortcoming, remains open.
Several Contractor's were appointed to undertake the different groups of components as
indicated earlier. This was necessary to ensure competency in the respective type of work, since
the components of this Project ranged from Instrument Landing Systems (which involves highly
sophisticated electronic gadgetry) to sheet piling. All the contractors performed very
satisfactorily.
With regard to improvement of MAA's accounting system, MAA provided necessary
information about the existing single entry system and other relevant data to the Management
Accountant. Project Implementation Unit and the Financial Section of MAA rendered all the
help it could, to the Management Accountant in order to facilitate the implementation of this
component.
Key lessons learned here are that:
a) the formation of a team specifically assigned to manage project implementation (in this case
PIU/MAA) is essential towards ensuring effective and timely implementation.
b) delay in securing financing can jeopardise effective implementation and can be costly in
terms of demobilisation and remobilisation costs incurred by contractors.
c) passenger/aircraft movements forecast for Male' Airport has always been under-estimated.
The primary reasons appear to be that Maldives is yet an emerging tourist  destination and
that the unique nature of its geography appeals to holiday makers   world-wide  especially
in this "green" era.
d) consultants who are in par with the Client's interests is essential to ensure a quality project
performance.
6. BANK PERFORMANCE
From the time of inception of the project the Bank was deeply involved in ensuring successful
completion. It took great interest in formulating a financially feasible project and its involvement
in the evolution of MAA into an autonomous corporation is recognised as proof of its interest in
making this organisation a viable entity.
More specifically its contribution to selecting the management accountant and financial
consultants were valuable to MAA.



32
Appendix B
page 6 of 6
The Bank sent regular missions to the Maldives to monitor the progress and hold discussions
with MAA. These discussions proved especially fruitful as the visiting missions were able to
gain first-hand knowledge of the status and problems and also advised the PIU on issues that
needed guidance from the Bank.
All withdrawal applications were processed on time.
Key lessons learned are that financing agency involvement in all phases of the project is vital to
attaining its objectives effectively. It provides constant opportunities to discuss problems and
arrive at solutions speedily thereby ensuring smooth progress.
7. PLAN FOR OPERATIONAL PHASE
As part of MAA's efforts at improving the maintenance procedures of infrastructure, equipment
etc., MAA is constantly assigning more manpower to the maintenance staff. Every training
opportunity is being used to this end. However, limited availability of local training facilities
necessitate certain levels/types of training to be undertaken only overseas. Same goes for
operational staff and this has always been the single most critical constraint in employing
appropriate manpower.
Of the many components of this project, all the performance indicators are limited to the
operations on the Runway, Apron and Passenger Terminal Building. This is because the key
indicators here are the nunber of passengers/aircraft that can be handled in these areas
efficiently. Presently MAA is keeping a data base of all operations.
However, performance indicators with regard to the new financial system are different in that
performance depends on the staff employed and their ability. To this end MAA has placed great
emphasis on training staff especially in this area. Presently selected MAA staff are attending a
diploma course in accounting at Male' and likewise executive staff are also receiving appropriate
training. In the interim, 3 expatriate financial staff have been employed to occupy key positions
until MAA can train appropriate staff to undertake their functions.
8. CONCLUSION
In conclusion the project as a whole has been a very successful one. MAA/Bank relationship was
extremely good. It was completed on time except for one component, which did not include the
Bank's financing. Male International Airport is growing rapidly, indicating good prospects for
loan repayment and above all a healthy rate of return on investment. We thank the officials of the
Bank who had been on site and those in office who had been involved in the project without
whose promptness we would not have made this project a success.
