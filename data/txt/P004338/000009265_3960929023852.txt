MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALDIVES
FOR THE MALE AIRPORT UPGRADING PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Maldives for SDR 5.9 million (US$7.5 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance a project for the
upgrading of Male Airport.  The project would be cofinanced by the Kuwait Fund
(US$8.5 million equivalent), the OPEC Fund (US$2.0 million equivalent), and the
Islamic Development Bank (US$3.0 million equivalent).
2.    Background.  The total land area of the Republic of Maldives amounts to
298 sq km and is made up of some 1,200 small coral islands dispersed over an
area extending 820 km from north to south and 130 km from east to west. Only
about 200 islands are permanently inhabited and the total population is estimated
at 205,000.  Despite formidaLlo' development constraints owing to small size,
geographic dispersion,  paucity cof land based natural resources and small
population base, the country has made notable progress in the p6at decade.  GDP
grew at an average annual rate of about 9.5 percent well in excess of the
population growth rate of 3.8 percent per annum.
3.    Government Strategy.  The Government of Maldives (GOM) has successfully
developed the country's few assets, in particular the abundant fishery resources
and more recently the tourism potential provided by the unique marine environment
of the coral islands. Fisheries and tourism have become the key sectorb of the
economy accounting for a third of GDP. While the role of tourism in the economy
was negligible in the early 1970s, in recent years it accounted for some 17
percent of GDP, more than half of foreign exchange earnings, over one-quarter
of Government tax revenue a-d a growing source of employment.
4.    GOM's tourism policies are pragmatic and it relies mainly on the private
sector for development of the industry. Currently, some 62 formerly uninhabited,
small islands are developed as tourist resorts. More than 80 per cent of these
islands are leased to the private sector. Of the leaseholders, about 85 percent
are Maldivian, the rest being foreign or joint ventures. All resorts are managed
by the private sector and more than half of the management companies are
Maldivian. Direct government expenditures in the sector have been negligible,
the only investment of any significance being the development of Male Airport
to international civil aviation standards in 1981. This investment permitted
direct flights from tourist generating regions to Male and greatly facilitated
the growth of tourist arrivals which increased from 33,000 in 1979 to some
158,500 in 1989.
5.    GOM also took steps to strengthen the aviation sector institutions,
principally the Maldives Airports Authority (MAA) and the Department of Civil
Aviation, through organizational measures and extensive training of their
personnel. In general, however, the emphasis has been on technical training;
management skills training such as resource planning, budgeting, accounting and
financial control have received less attention.   Furthermore, although the
appelation of MAA as an authority suggests a high degree of autonomy, it



- 2 -
functions strictly as a department of the Government. Its financial operations
are merged with the general revenue and expenditure accounts of the Government,
it has no cash flow control and accounting reports are not routinely prepared.
However, Government's long term aim is to vest MAA with some form of financial
autonomy.
6.    To safeguard the viability and growth potential of the tourist industry,
one of GOM's main investment strategies is to remedy a number of critical
deficiencies at Male airport which are increasingly threatening efficient and
safe operations and to bring the airport's facilities in line with traffic levels
expected in the near to medium term.  The deficiencies result in part from
increasing utilization of heavier, wide-bodied aircraft causing damage to the
runway and serious congestion at the terminal building. The unprecedented strong
tidal wave action of 1987, which caused considerable physical damage, had also
underlined the need to provide for more effective shore protection.  During
1986/87 a project - formulated in the context of a masterplan for the airport -
was presented for financing to a group of cofinanciers.   Processing of the
project, however was seriously delayed owing to difficulties in firming up a
feasible financing plan and this led the Government to request the Bank Group
in December 1988 to participate in financing the project.
7.    Rationale for IDA Involvement and Project Objectives.  The project aims
at maintaining the viability and growth potential of tourism, the key sector of
the economy, through improrements at Male airport upon which the tourist industry
is  critically  dependent.       To  this  end,  the  project  provides  for
rehabilitation/upgrading of the airport's facilities and for institution building
through technical assistance and training.   IDA participation is aimed at
ensuring that: (i) urgently needed investments in a key sector of the economy
are not delayed any further; (ii) the project scope is limited to a program of
well justified investments; and (iii) MAA's institutional capacity is further
improved.
8.    Project Description.   The project will provide for upgrading of the
existing airport (which completely occupies a small island situated partly on
reclaimed land) including:  (i) runway rehabilitation and extension through
stabilization of se3ctions of the runway, reconstruction of a section of the
original runway and application of an overlay;  (ii) reconstruction of the
aircraft turning pads; (iii) extension of the aircraft parking apron;
(iv) shore protection through reinforcement of the seawall at critical locations
around the airport island; (v) modification and extension of the airport terminal
complex including upgrading of utilities; (vi) improvement of aids to navigation;
(vii) equipment for power generation and fire fighting; and (viii) technical
assistance and training for strengthening the capabilities of MAA in the
accounting and financial areas. The total cost of the pro4act is estimated at
US$25.95 million equivalent with a foreign exchange componen.. of US$25.0 million
(97 percent). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.   Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.  A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Maldives are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 8464-MAL dated April 30, 1990, is being distributed separately.



9.    Environmental Aspect.  The project entails no major environmental issues
as it consists of rehabilitationlimprovement of existing facilities. The minor
issues arising from both airport operation and the construction activities during
project implementation concern the protection of the limited body of sweet water
on the airport island and the safeguarding of neighboring coral reefs. Potential
impacts are being addressed through the design solutions providing for good
sanitation practices; the prevention of contamination of the groundwater and the
coral reef; and the protection of coral stone.  Potential conatruction stage
hazards will be addressed by providing in the contract documents for
environmentally sound practices during work execution. Compliance with these
provisions will be carefully monitored during implementation.
10.   Agreed Actions.  Agreement was reached that:  (i) GOM will make adequate
overall budgetary provisions to cover its contribution to the project including
any unforeseen adverse cost development; (ii) establishment of an adequately
staffed Project Implementation Unit will be a condition of effectiveness of the
Credit; (iii) MAM will introduce by January 31, 1993 new, commercial-type,
accounting and information systems and will engage the services of a consultant
and a management accountant to design the systems and assist in their
implementation; and (iv) MMA will through airport tariffs, annually, generate
(a) revenues sufficient to cover operating expenses; and (b) funds sufficient
to meet its debt service and make reasonable payments to GOM.
12.   Benefits and Risk.  The project will safeguard the revenue generating
capacity of the tourist industry and provide the basis for its continued growth.
Without the project the level of service provided to airlines and passengers
would deteriorate and the airport could not continue to service wide-bodied
aircraft. This would downgrade the Maldives as a tourist destination, affect
tourist arrivals and in general rapidly impair the industry's revenue generating
capability. Although cost estimates are based oa detailed engineering designs,
some uncertainty remains regarding the cost estimates for the works components
given the general unfamiliarity of foreign contractors with working conditions
in the Maldives. The Government will address this risk by: (i) ensuring that
all prospective bidders are fully familiar with the situation in the Maldives
early on in the bidding process; and (ii) using a contract form which is
recognized in the industry as balanced and fair.
13.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the )roposed Credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Credit.
