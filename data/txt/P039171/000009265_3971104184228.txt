Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The development objective of the project is to improve agricultural productivity of rainfed and irrigated
crops on about 14 percent of the total agricultural area of Yemen (about 190,000 ha at full development - year 10).
The strategy for achieving this objective under the proposed project would be to develop a sustainable system for
the supply and use of seed of adapted varieties, fertilizers and other inputs. Progress toward this objective would be
monitored and evaluated on the basis of increases in major crop yields of farmers who use quality seeds of superior
varieties and/or adequate amounts of fertilizers.

3. Benefits and target population
(a) Benefits:
*    Increased agricultural production: the most tangible benefit would be increased production and yields
of major rainfed and irrigated crops. At full development (year 10), it is anticipated that incremental
annual production would amount to about 32,000 metric tons (mt) of vegetables (representing 7
percent of present production), 8,700 mt of potato (5 percent of present production), 7,200 mt of
wheat (4 percent of present production), 1,400 mt of maize (2 percent of present production) and
4,800 mt of sorghum/millet (1 percent of present production).
*    Stabilization of rural incomes: seed of superior land races and better adapted varieties would stabilize
crop yields and reduce the risks of crop failure for rainfed farmers.
*    Better management of natural resources: higher and more secure rainfed agricultural production and
farm incomes would reduce the need for farmers to move towards more irrigated agriculture or
expand cropping into marginal lands and hence lead to the conservation and more efficient use of
natural resources.
.    Reduced pressure on the Government budget: the efficient and commercial operation of the three
seed centers would reduce transfers from the Government budget to these institutions.
*    Greater efficiency and increased private sector participation in the seeds and inputs sectors: through
enabling policy measures (price liberalization, elimination of licensing from the Ministry of
Agriculture and Water Resources - MAWR, etc.), legal reforms (seed and fertilizers laws) and
capacity building (restructuring of seed centers) all of which would result in competitive prices for
farm inputs.
(b) Target population:
The project is expected to benefit over 116,000 rural households or about 842,000 people (7 percent of rural
population) throughout Yemen. Because it focuses, inter alia, on selecting disease-resistant, superior land races and
varieties for rainfed areas (Sana'a, Al Mahweet, Taiz, Ibb, etc.), the project would target rainfed farmers and help
reduce poverty among this poorest segment of the Yemeni rural population.
. 1 1....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
4. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements (also see Block 3, section 16):
Implementation period: Five years (1998-2002)
Executing Agencies:
*    The project will be implemented by six entities. Five are under the supervision of the Minister of
Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) and would be directly responsible for carrying out
specific activities. The sixth, the General Agricultural Cooperative (GAC), is an NGO.
*    To ensure timely and efficient implementation, the Government has recently created a Project
Support Unit (PSU). The PSU will not be an implementing entity but it will support the project
executing entities by: handling all procurement and disbursement activities, maintaining project
accounts and consolidating project monitoring and evaluation reports, and serving as the liaison with
IDA. The PSU will be based in Sana'a and will be headed by a Director. In addition to the Director,
the PSU will include procurement officers, certified accountants, one bilingual secretary and general
service staff.
*    The General Directorate of Plant Production (GDPP) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water
Resources (MAWR) will be responsible for Component (a) -- implementation of private sector
promotion and quality control.
*    The three seed entities (Potato Seed Company - PSC, Onion/vegetable Seed Company - OVSC, and
Seed Multiplication Center - SMC) will each be responsible for component (b), namely: (i)
implementing the sourcing and testing of superior varieties through contractual services; (ii)
increasing breeder/foundation seed; (iii) providing assistance to private seed producers; (iv)
processing and controlling quality of farmer-produced seed; (v) transforming their operations (PSC
and OVSC) into commercial enterprises; and (vi) developing domestic and export seed markets.

Country: Republic of Yemen                             Project Title: Seeds and Agricultural Services Project
The Agricultural Services Corporation (ASC) and the recently created General Agricultural
Cooperative (GAC) would be responsible for implementing component (c) of the project.
(a)   The ASC would be responsible for the importation, wholesale, and establishment of a
network of private retailers for the distribution of fertilizers and spare parts financed
under the project. It would also distribute subsequent imports financed from the proceeds
of the credit to increase its working capital and enable it to sustain the importation of
fertilizers and spare parts on its own; and
(b)  The GAC would be responsible for the importation, wholesale and distribution, through
its cooperatives network in remote rural areas, of the fertilizers procured under the
project and subsequent imports made possible by the credit provided by the Government.
The proceeds of the sale of fertilizers and equipment procured under the project will be
on-lent by the Government to GAC and would serve to increase its capital. This credit
will be paid back by GAC in Yemeni Rials. The credit on-lent by the Government to
capitalize GAC would be repaid to the Government on terms satisfactory to IDA. It was
agreed that repayment be over a period of 13 years at a variable market rate pegged to
the longest term treasury bill issued by the Central Bank of Yemen. The services and
inputs distributed by GAC will be sold to cooperative members and to the public at large.
Price discounts to GAC members cannot exceed two percent of the price charged to the
general public. GAC has agreed to use the proceeds from the sale of the fertilizer
provided under the project financing for regular importation and distribution of a
minimum of 4,000 tons of fertilizers annually. The rest of its financial resources would
be used for the provision of spare parts and other inputs.
. A National Seed Board (NSB) with broader representation (including farmers, NGOs, traders and
Government agencies) than the existing Seed Steering Committee (SSC) will be created in lieu of the
SSC by the seed law to provide policy advice to the Minister of Agriculture, certify new germplasm
and authorize the release of new crop varieties. A decree nominating the members of the NSB will be
issued by the Minister of Agriculture and Water Resources before December 31, 1998.
Project Coordination and Oversight
Previous experience with other projects in Yemen indicates that coordination arrangements can cause undue
project delays and are not, in this case, necessary. The PSU and its Director would be under the oversight and
authority of the Minister of Agriculture. The three seed centers and the ASC would be, as called for by their
statutes, under the oversight of their Boards of Directors and the Minister of Agriculture and Water Resources.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements:
The PSU will be responsible for keeping project accounts, reporting and auditing on the basis of systems and
procedures acceptable to IDA. MAWR has generally submitted timely audit reports which have been satisfactory to
IDA. Accounting records will be kept for all project-related expenditures and financing. Project accounts will be
audited annually, following international auditing standards by auditors acceptable to IDA. Provision has been
made under the project for technical assistance to help the PSU set up its accounting system and ledgers and for the
autonomous agencies involved in project to have their accounts audited by private auditors. The annual audit report
of the project would be submitted to IDA within six months of the end of each financial year. The project's Special
Account would be managed by the PSU and would also be audited.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements:
Project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) will be the responsibility of the project implementing agencies
(PSC, OVSC, SMC, ASC and GAC). They will undertake periodic data collection and analysis. The PSU would
consolidate the M&E reports of the various agencies and record their results in the semi-annual and annual project
reports. Monitoring and evaluation will be guided by the Project Implementation Plan (PIP), the monitoring and
evaluation performance indicators (Working Paper No. 6) and the Project Design Summary (Annex 1). M&E

Country: Republic of Yemen                                     Project Title: Seeds and Agricultural Services Project
would be conducted through: (a) periodic opinion surveys to be undertaken by the implementing agencies; (b) IDA
supervision missions; (c) annual progress reports; and (d) the project mid-term review (section 24, point 8). The
Borrower will update the PIP in consultation with IDA during the project's mid-term review, in June 2000 (section
24, point 8). The PSU will submit to IDA semi-annual progress reports (in July and January of each year) based on
semi-annual reports prepared by each of the executing agencies, complete a mid-term review by June 2000 and
submit to IDA a final evaluation report by November 30, 2002.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project            Document number and date of latest CAS discussion:
No. 15286 dated 01/19/1996
The proposed project would support a key objective of the CAS - promoting sustainable natural and human
resources development. The project would support this objective by developing adapted cultivars and improving
the efficiency of land and water resource use. Priority for the project has been established in both the CAS and the
Public Expenditure Review. The project would also be a key instrument for achieving the Government's objective
for improving agricultural productivity and food security in the rural areas where 70 percent of the population and
84 percent of the poor live.
....................................................................................................................................................................................................................
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy
Sector Issues
The key issues facing the agriculture sector are:
.    Lack of a comprehensive policy and legal framework to develop the seed and input supply sectors
and promote greater private sector participation (CAS - Report No. 15286-YEM);
*    An eroding natural resource base (CAS Report);
*    Policy-induced distortions (food subsidies to urban areas) with a negative impact on agriculture
(Poverty Assessment Report No. 15158-YEM);
*    Weak and under-performing public institutions managed by staff with inadequate training and
compensation (CAS Report);
*    Ineffective generation of suitable technologies to improve presently stagnant agricultural productivity
(Agriculture Sector Study Report No. 11 126-YEM), particularly for rainfed production systems; and
.    Scarcity of agricultural inputs as a result of unstructured, oligopolistic and underdeveloped private
sector input supply channels (Agriculture Sector Study Report).
Government Strategy
To deal with these and other issues, the Government is working with bilateral and multilateral donors to
restructure the country's economy and eliminate economic distortions. The Government has also formulated a five-
year-plan for the development of its economy. For the agricultural sector, the plan calls for a strategy aimed at
creating enabling policy and legal environments, increasing agricultural productivity, promoting food security and
private sector development, upgrading the country's human resources and improving the management of natural
resources.
..........................................................................................................................................................................................................
7. Main Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
*    The issue of lack of policy and legal frameworks for the seed and fertilizers sub-sectors would be
addressed up-front. During project preparation, PHRD grant financing was used to assist MAWR
formulate a seed and fertilizer law and to restructure the seed centers as autonomous companies (PSC
and OVSC) and a corporation (SMC). The draft law is simple and practical; it eliminates licensing,
promotes and encourages private initiative and regulates quality standards and truth in labeling
among others. A policy statement which recognizes market pricing, encourages competition and
promotes participation of the private sector in the seed and input supply subsectors has been prepared
by MAWR. The draft seed and fertilizer law is currently at the Parliament for enactment.

Country: Republic of Yemen                                    Project Title: Seeds and Agricultural Services Project
.    Lack of availability of suitable technologies, i.e. unavailability of seeds of adapted varieties and land
races for rainfed and irrigated crops would be alleviated by financing varietal sourcing, testing and
seed development activities.
*    Weaknesses in human resources and capacity of the public and private sector institutions involved in
the project (the three seed centers, the ASC and GAC) would be mitigated through (a) institutional
restructuring; (b) technical assistance; and (c) training.
*    The scarcity of agricultural inputs would be addressed through the promotion of competition and
greater involvement of the private sector in the import/supply and distribution of inputs.
The proposed project has been designed as a public sector project because:(a) the formulation of policy and
regulatory framework is a public sector function; (b) the private sector is not yet interested in seed processing and
distribution; (c) food security concerns and the lack of interest on the part of the private sector in developing
adapted varieties and superior land races. This is particularly true for open pollinated crops which would continue
to need Government budgetary support; and (d) the public sector is able and willing and has requested IDA's
assistance to promote private sector participation, particularly NGOs participation in the seeds and input supply
sectors.
.........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection;
.    The alternative of immediately privatizing the three existing seed centers prior to project
implementation was considered but was discarded because: (i) private sector showed no interest in
them due to the fact that the centers were not financially self-supportive; (ii) they would be sold at
below their real value; and (iii) adequate and enabling legal and institutional environments for the
sector did not exist. It was decided to restructure and commercialize the seed centers before their
privatization and to enact a legal framework conducive to sector growth and private sector
development. In addition, it was realized that seeds of open pollinated crops could not be
commercially viable due to the nature of the seeds. The seeds of those crops can be multiplied and
sold by anyone without any practical way for the seed institution to protect its right of ownership of
the new variety. This is not only the case in Yemen but also in other developing and developed
countries as well.
*    In view of the oligopolistic behavior of existing private input suppliers, the alternative of providing
them and other traders with credit and technical assistance was rejected because it would not have
been a sufficient incentive to create competition among them. It was decided to promote competition
by supporting the entry of the ASC and GAC in the supply of fertilizer and other inputs.
*    The restructuring and subsequent privatization (PSP and OVSP) of the existing three public seed
centers would ensure their increased efficiency and sustainability.
*    Commercializing the supply and distribution of inputs by public enterprises would rationalize their
operation and make them more competitive and sustainable.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
*    Clear policy and legal frameworks for the seed and inputs subsectors are essential for the promotion
and involvement of the private sector (lesson from the social assessment carried out as part of project
preparation).
*    Good management skills and managerial/institutional autonomy are prerequisites for improving the
efficiency and performance of existing seed centers (lesson from the experience of the Seed
Multiplication Project supported by the EU, the Potato Seed Project suppported by the Netherlands
and the Onion/Vegetable Seed Project supported by the Arab Organization for Agricultural
Development in the OVSC).
*    Financing the importation and distribution of inputs by competitive and commercial public
enterprises may lead to satisfactory performance (lesson from OED Impact Evaluation Report -
14761-IN on four seed projects).
*    Strengthening of procurement, disbursement and accounting capabilities needs particular attention
(SPPR/CPPR recommendations).
...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership
*    The project is included as one of the Government's priority projects in its Five-Year Development
Plan (1996-2000).
*    There has been broad participation of stakeholders in project identification and preparation
(Section 19).
*    MAWR and Ministry of Planning and Development (MOPD) have:
(a)   formulated clear policy and legal frameworks for the seeds and input supply sectors;
(b)   restructured the PSC and OVSC into autonomous companies, agreed to offer them for
privatization, and made the SMC into a semi-autonomous corporation;
(c)   committed themselves to redeploy/reduce excess staff out of the three seed centers (in
accordance with agreed timetable;
(d)   submitted the legal and institutional frameworks for enactment by the appropriate
authorities before negotiations; and
(e)   agreed to on-lend part of the credit proceeds to the GAC to enable it to increase its
capital and sustain its activity in the input importlsupply sector.
12. Value added of Bank support:
The preparation of the proposed project benefited from Bank support through four Bank activities: the CAS,
a Public Expenditure Review, a Poverty Assessment and mobilization of grant funds/co-financing to assist with
project preparation and stakeholders participation. In addition, Bank focused the Government's attention on many
issues in the sector, i.e. legal and institutional frameworks, and on designing ways to address them (formulation of
seed and fertilizer law and statutes for the PSC and OVSC).
Country Assessment Strategy:
The CAS was prepared with the participation of the MOPD and the collaboration of MAWR at a time when
the new Five Year Development Plan (1996-2000) was being formulated. As a result, the development priority of
the project and its relevance to the development of the agricultural sector was confirmed in both the CAS and the
Five Year Plan.
Public Expenditure Review:
The recently completed Public Expenditure Review (PER) further demonstrated that the strategy of
improving agricultural productivity was consistent with the Government's overall fiscal strategy and priorities.
Povertv Assessment:
The poverty assessment, completed in June 1996, concluded that 81 percent of the poor live in rural areas. In
these rural areas, agriculture is the main engine of growth, and the availability of quality seeds and other farm inputs
are essential to increased agricultural productivity and growth.

Mobilization of Grant Funds:
A PHRD grant was instrumental in helping the Government conduct several pre-preparation studies and
stakeholder participation activities. The PHRD grant:
(a) provided incentives and assisted the Government in preparing policy, legal and institutional frameworks;
and
(b) successfully promoted and used social assessments, participatory approaches and other tools, to
involve stakeholders in project design and implementation.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment (Annex 4):          Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$18.4 million; ERR= 36%
The project is economically sound. The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) was calculated on the basis of the
benefits stemming from the increased productivity of major crops (Working Paper No. 5). This increase in
productivity would be due to the use of improved seeds (yields up by 8 percent at full development) and fertilizer
(up by 24 percent) that would become available to farmers as a result of the project. The impact of seeds is
expected to materialize starting in year five of the project and reach full development in year ten. It was assumed
that the impact of the fertilizers would be realized by year three of the project.
The increase in capitalization of the ASC and GAC is expected to enable the two input suppliers to purchase
and distribute annually at least half the quantities (10,000 MT and 8,000 MT respectively) of fertilizers initially
procured under the Project. The rest of the capital would be used to supply other farm inputs. The ERRs for each
of the fertilizer and seed components and for each of the seed centers were calculated and the results are shown in
Annex 4. The NPVs were calculated at 12 percent cost of capital. Alternative project designs were considered for
both the seeds and fertilizer components.
Risk Analysis
The sensitivity analysis indicated that: (i) droughts occuring twice every five years would not jeopardize
project viability. These droughts would reduce the NPV to $17.7 million and the ERR to 35 percent in economic
terms and reduce the NPV to $8.5 million and the FRR to 23 percent in financial terms; (ii) the economic result is
marginally sensitive to the assumptions made on on-farm benefits. The ERR would be reduced to 12 percent by a
decrease of 52 percent in on-farm benefits. However, because the assumptions made on crop yields are quite
conservative, the probability that the accrued benefits would be lower than those assumed is considered very low.
On the other hand, the economic results of the project show that the project can absorb a cost increase of up to 108
percent before the ERR is reduced to 12 percent.
Fiscal impact:
The project would have a positive fiscal impact. By becoming profit-making enterprises, the PSC, OVSC,
SMC and ASC would pay 65 percent of their annual profits to the Government. The GAC would pay 34 percent of
its annual profits in taxes. In year five of the project, PSC, OVSC, SMC and ASC would pay into the Government
treasury an estimated US$3.9 million equivalent. The GAC would contribute an estimated US$14,000 equivalent in
year five of the project and about US$117,000 equivalent in year 16, when its loan from the Government is fully
paid (see Annex 4). In addition, the Government would gain substantial financial resources from the privatization
of the PSC, OVSC and ASC.
Laboratory services for the quality control of seeds and fertilizers would be sustained without impact on
public expenditures by having traders pay for the analysis of their samples (as called for in the new seed law).
Varietal development would be continued after the project by the commercially operating PSC and OVSC for
potato and vegetable crops and by the Agricultural Research and Extension Authority (AREA) for self-pollinated
crops.

Country: Republic of Yemen                                   Project Title: Seeds and Agricultural Services Project
14. Financial Assessment                          NPV = US$14.3 million            FRR = 30%
The project is financially sound. The financial NPV that would accrue to the three seed centers, ASC and
GAC is estimated at US$11.8 million equivalent (see Annex 4). The operating income as a percentage ofrevenue is
expected to improve in year five of the project (from base year 1996) from 24 percent to 52 percent for the PSC,
remain at about 80 percent for the OVSC, increase from negative 60 percent to 20 percent for the SMC, increase
from 31 percent to 36 percent for the ASC and reach 14 percent for GAC (Annex 5).
By restructuring and making the three seed centers more efficient and making the PSC, OVSC, and ASC
commercial and profitable, the allocation of budgetary funds to run these agencies would be reduced significantly.
Government contribution would be reduced by about US$100,000 annually or by up to 75 percent in year 5 of the
project.
.   fi    i.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
15. Technical Assessment
The project is technically sound. It addresses the fundamental issue of farmers' access to quality seeds and
other inputs that are essential to increased agricultural productivity and rural incomes. The scope and reach of the
new seed and fertilizer laws that the project would help put in place are also sound, practical and within the
implementation capacity of the Borrower. The proposed institutional arrangements which would restructure the
PSC and OVSC and the SMC have been developed with significant stakeholder participation and are adapted to the
Yemeni context. Project components (seed and fertilizers quality control, variety testing and development,
restructuring of seed institutions, and the expansion of inputs marketing channels) were prepared on the basis of
achievable technical standards. Innovations, such as the contracting of variety testing and laboratory analysis to the
private sector and the participation of an NGO in project implementation, have been designed with the participation
and support of stakeholders. The anticipated increase in agricultural productivity resulting from the increased
availability and use of quality seed and fertilizers is reasonable and is in line with the present yields (plus 20 to 30
percent) achieved by farmers who have access to these inputs.
Project cost estimates have been developed on the basis of actual local or international prices collected by the
project preparation mission and include reasonable physical (5%/O) and price (4%/O) contingencies.
........................................................................................................................................................................................
16. Institutional Assessment:
Executing agencies:
*    The GDPP of the MAWR, which would be responsible for the promotion of the private sector as well
as the implementation of the regulatory and quality control functions in the seed and agricultural
inputs sectors, has very limited capacity and expertise. Provisions for contractual services for
seeds/fertilizers analysis, technical assistance and staff training have been made under the project to
address these constraints. The seed and fertilizers laws have already been drafted and the
Government has submitted these draft law to Parliament for enactment before negotiations
*    The three existing seed centers lack the structure and statutes that would enable their management as
autonomous, self-supporting enterprises. To alleviate this constraint, the PSC, OVSC and SMC will
be restructured into autonomous public companies. The Government has finalized the company
statutes and authorised their creation. With the exception of the SMC, which would continue to
benefit from reduced Government budgetary support, the seed companies have the potential to
become self-sustaining, commercial entities by year 3 of the Project, provided they are managed as
independent profit-making enterprises. During negotiations Government gave assurances that it will
offer part or all of the PSC and the OVSC for private sector ownership by December 31, 2001 . The
major problems currently faced by all three seed centers are: (i) lack of management autonomy,
including the setting of personnel salaries and prices for seeds; (ii) overstaffing, for which the
Government has agreed to redeploy or reduce excess staff at the three seed centers (111 staff for the
SMC, 18 staff for the PSC and 10 staff for the OVSP) before December 31, 1998; severance
payments to staff will be determined in a manner satisfactory to IDA and the Borrower will require
the companies not to rehire reduced staff; (iii) inadequate institutional capabilities, particularly in
managerial skills would be addressed under the proposed project.

*   The ASC, which is a semi-autonomous and financially self supporting public enterprise has had
profitable operations since 1993. Due to its small capital base (US$0.5 million equivalent), it has not
been able to enter the fertilizers import business. However, it has had a good experience in the
distribution and sales of government-procured fertilizers and other inputs. It is well staffed and well
organized but lacks expertise in computerized accounting and auditing. Its transportation fleet is old
and subject to frequent breakdowns, thereby reducing its capacity to move large amount of goods. To
alleviate the capital constraint, the Government has agreed that the proceeds of the sale of fertilizer
and spare parts, as well as the trucks financed under the project for the ASC, will be used by the ASC
to increase its capital and enable it to import inputs. Financing for upgrading ASC's human resources
have also been included in the project. The Government has also agreed to offer the ASC for
privatization by December 31, 2001.
.   The GAC, an NGO, has been created by the Union of Agricultural Cooperatives (UAC). At the
request of the Government, it was included in the project to expand input supply marketing channels.
To enable GAC to enter the input supply and distribution channels, the project would finance the cost
of 8,000 mt of fertilizers, as well as institutional capacity building. During negotiations the
Government has agreed to sign a subsidiary agreement with GAC to on-lend it, on terms satisfactory
to IDA the amount of US$2.1 million equivalent for its capitalization.
Project management:
*    In order to avoid creating an implementation unit in each of the project agencies, a PSU has been
created to support all the project agencies. The PSU will be responsible for: (i) preparing,
advertising, evaluating and awarding contracts for the procurement of civil works, goods and
services; (ii) managing the project's special account and preparing withdrawal/replenishment
applications; and (iii) keeping and auditing project accounts, consolidating project reports and
monitoring and evaluating project actions. A qualified core staff of the PSU has been nominated by
the Government and would receive an allowance from the project. Operational cost of the PSU has
been included in the project. The PSU would be phased out shortly after Credit closing.
*   Because of inadequate managerial capabilities, the PSC, OVSC, SMC, ASC and GAC would benefit
from staff training and technical assistance (TA); the cost of this assistance was built into the project.
The Government has agreed to procure management and technical assistance expertise through
contractual arrangements for both the SMC and OVSC starting in year one of the project. In
addition, short term TA has been provided for private sector promotion, seed quality control,
procurement, accounting and auditing.
.........................................................................................................................................................................................
17. Social Assessment:
Two Rapid Rural Appraisals (RRA), a Needs Assessment (NA) and several thematic and project design
workshops were undertaken during project preparation.
The RRAs and NA identified several socio-economic and institutional factors affecting agricultural
production and the general welfare of farmers. These are:
(a)     oligopolistic control of agricultural inputs, particularly fertilizers and spare parts by a
small group of importers, leading to artificial scarcity and high prices;
(b)     weak and inefficient public agricultural services, in particular in the seed sector; and
(c)     limited involvement of the private sector and grassroot organizations in the provision
of inputs and in marketing of produce, owing to an absence of enabling policies and
legislation.
On this basis, the project design makes provision for institutional improvement, and has been enlarged from a seeds
project to include the provision of agricultural inputs and services. As designed, the proposed project fits well
within the Yemeni socio-cultural context.

18. Environmental Assessment:                       Environmental Category        C
*   No negative effects on the environment are expected from the project, nor would the project cause
resettlement or affect indigenous peoples;
*   the evaluation, selection and conservation of land races of major cereal crops native to Yemen would
contribute to the conservation of local genetic biodiversity;
*   by developing pest- and disease-resistant cultivars, the project would help reduce the need to use
chemical pesticides and insecticides, which would have a positive impact on the environment; and
*   higher and more secure incomes from rainfed agriculture (reduced risk of crop failure as a result of
introducing diseases- and drought-tolerant varieties) would reduce the need for farmers to develop
irrigated agriculture or expand agriculture to marginal areas and, hence, lead to the conservation and
more efficient use of water and land resources.
19. Participatory Approach:
At the project identification stage, an RRA was conducted by a multi-disciplinary team. During this
participatory exercise, major stakeholders were identified and consulted with regard to their problems, objectives
and priorities. Modalities on how to solve problems and reach goals were also discussed.
To ensure greater representation, an NA was later conducted nationwide. The results were shared and
discussed with the major stakeholders during two workshops. The preparation mission structured its work
according to the recommendations at the NA. Close collaboration between the Bank, the consultants and MAWR
was maintained throughout project preparation. During project implementation, particular attention would be given
to the involvement of farmers through grassroots organizations, in particular the UAC.

20. Sustainability:
The project is designed to promote long-term sustainability by: (i) creating a conducive legal environment for
private sector participation in the seed and input supply sectors; (ii) commercializing the operation and privatizing
the PSC, OVSC and ASC and, hence, reducing the fiscal burden on Government budget; (iii) promoting small-
holder seed producers (section 2-b) to enhance seed development; and (iv) ensuring adequate capitalization and
autonomy of the ASC and GAC to allow them to enter the farm input supply market and remain competitive.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Some government agencies may resist full implementation of the staff reduction plan, the privatization of the
seed centers and the ASC and the support to GAC. During negotiations, the Borrower gave assurances that agreed
covenants will be implemented in a timely manner. Present oligopolistic input suppliers may voice opposition to
the project in the hope of maintaining their present influence on the market.

Seeds and Agricultural Services Project
,Project Appraisal Document
Detailed Project Description
The project would finance four components.
A.  Private Sector Promotion and Seed/Fertilizers Quality Control Component
(Cost US$0.3 million or 2% of total cost)
1.   Under this component, three major activities would be financed by the project and implemented by the
General Directorate of Plant Production (GDPP) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources
(MAWR). They are:
(a)    The enactment and implementation of a new policy, as well as legal and institutional
frameworks, for the purpose of increasing growth in the seeds and fertilizers sectors and
promoting greater participation of the private sector in them. Through PHRD grant financing, a
draft seed and fertilizer law and draft statutes for the proposed Potato Seed Company (PSC),
Onion/Vegetable Seed Company (OVSC) and the Seed Multiplication Corporation (SMC) have
already been drafted and would be submitted by Government for enactment before project
negotiations. The new seed and fertilizers laws are simple and practical. They basically aim at
(i) creating the National Seed Board (NSB) as a consultative body advising the Minister of
Agriculture on seed policy issues and variety registration; (ii) encouraging private investment in
the seed sector by providing matching grant funds (10% of total cost) for the conduct of
investment projects feasibility studies; (iii) providing the seed sector with the benefits stipulated
in the country's general investment law and allowing foreign seed companies to operate in
Yemen; (iv) defining the criteria for seed registration; (v) recognizing property rights for variety
development; and (vi) establishing truth in labeling for containerized seed and fertilizers.
(b)    Provision of information and encouraging private sector to invest and take advantage of the
financial assistance provided for in the National Investment Law and the new Seed Law
(financial assistance to private operators for undertaking investment feasibility studies - to be
financed from the Agriculture and Fisheries Development Fund-AFDF). Under this
component, funding would be provided for promoting the participation of private enterprise in
the seed and fertilizer sectors as well as the use of superior-quality seed by farmers. These
promotional activities would be implemented through radio and television information
campaigns as well as the organization of workshops and seminars.
(c)    The establishment of a seed and fertilizers quality control system . This system would allow
the MAWR to inspect, monitor and verify that labels on seed and fertilizer containers are true to
content. A small cluster of GDPP staff (3 to 4 inspectors) stationed in Sana'a and in regional
offices of the MAWR would periodically collect seed and fertilizer samples throughout Yemen
and have them analyzed, through contractual arrangements at the University of Sana'a (UOS),
the Agricultural Research and Extension Authority (AREA) or at private laboratories.



- 18-
Annex 2
Page 2 of 3
2.   To allow the GDPP to acquire the institutional and technical capacity needed to implement the above
activities, the project would finance seed/fertilizer laboratory analysis contracts, staff training, technical
assistance, office equipment and operating costs.
B.   Seed Development Support Component (Cost US$5.3 million or 37% of Total Cost)
3.   Under this component, the project would assist the three seed centers (PSC, OVSC and SMC) in
reducing excess staff, restructuring/streamlining their operations and developing quality seed of superior land
races and varieties. To implement these actions, the Project would finance:
(a)    Severance payments, through government financing, to staff not needed by the PSC (18 staff);
the OVSC (10 staff) and the SMC (110 staff).
(b)    Activities aimed at testing, selecting and developing superior land races and adapted varieties of
cereals, potato, onion and vegetable crops through service contracts with public and/or private
operators. Superior land races and adapted varieties for rainfed crop production would be the
object of special focus. Seed of superior land race and adapted varieties would be multiplied by
private seed growers under contractual arrangements and sold by the seed centers to farmers.
Seed would also be produced, with the assistance of the SMC, by small holder seed producers,
who would receive small amounts of foundation/registered seed of land races and adapted
varieties for multiplication and dissemination through market and informal channels.
(c)    The project would also help improve the efficiency and commercialize the operation of two of
the three existing seed centers (PSC and OVSC) and prepare the PSC and OVSC for
privatization. To provide the PSC and OVSC with the autonomy they require to operate as
efficient, commercial enterprises, the Government would restructure them into General
Companies. The SMC would also be restructured to improve its efficiency and productivity. It
would not, however, attain the status of a commercial enterprise.
4.   To implement the above two activities, the project would finance contractual services for collecting,
testing and evaluating varieties of major rainfed and irrigated crops: sorghum, barley, maize, millet, potato,
onion, vegetable and fodder crops. It would also finance seed sourcing and production of breeder seed for
superior varieties; the upgrading of seed testing and production equipment; the rehabilitation of seed treatment
facilities; operation and maintenance costs, as well as technical assistance for enterprise management under
contractual arrangements.
C.   Expansion of Input Supply Marketing Channels (Cost US$8.0 million or 56% of Total
Cost)
5.   The project would help address the present market under-provision of fertilizers and spare parts and help
attenuate the effects of existing private sector monopolies, as well as the chronic shortages of farm inputs by:
(a)    Promoting and financing the entry in the input import/supply sectors of: (i) a financially self-
supporting public institution - the Agricultural Services Corporation (ASC); and (ii) the planned
General Agricultural Cooperative (GAC) to be established by the Union of Agricultural
Cooperatives (UAC) - an NGO representing farmers throughout Yemen.



- 19-
Annex 2
Page 3 of 3
(b)    To help create the GAC and allow it and the ASC to operate in the input supply sectors , the
project would finance the procurement of transport equipment, vehicles, storage facilities,
training, technical assistance as well as 14,000 tons of fertilizers (10,000 MT for the ASC and
8,000 MT for the GAC) and spare parts.
6.  In order to sustain the involvement of the ASC and the GAC in the importation and distribution of
inputs, the proceeds of the sale of fertilizers, spare parts and heavy equipment procured under the project for
these institutions would be capitalized by the ASC and the GAC (through government on-lending of the
proceeds of part of the Credit to the GAC). Imported inputs would be distributed by the ASC through a
planned network of 30 private retailers and by the GAC through the existing national network of regional and
local agricultural cooperatives.
D.  Establishment of a Project Support Unit (Cost US$0.7 million or 5% of Total Cost)
7.   The project would have a duration of five years and would involve a total of six executing agencies. The
GDPP, the PSC, the OVSC, the SMC and the ASC are all under the supervision of MAWR. The new GAC is
an NGO. The above executing agencies do not have the experience necessary to implement project
procurement, disbursement, accounting and auditing activities according to Bank guidelines and standards.
Instead of giving each of the six institutions the capability necessary to conduct procurement, disbursement,
accounting, etc., a Project Support Unit (PSU) has been created to undertake these activities. Project
implementation responsibilities and procedures are detailed in the Project Implementation Plan.
8.   The staff of the PSU, which will have to be approved by IDA, has been nominated by the Government
before Board presentation. It would only be required during the life of the Project and would be disbanded at
the closing date of the Credit. It would be headed by a Director (with excellent English language skills and
strong competency in reporting as well as in project monitoring and evaluation) and include procurement
officers, accountants, a secretary (with excellent Eiiglish and Arabic skills) and general service staff. In
addition to the above staff the PSU would benefit from project-financed technical assistance in
accounting/disbursement ( 3 person months) and in auditing (5 person months). Project accounts would be
audited by private auditors designated by COCA. The staff of the PSU would receive allowances financed
under the Project.
9.   The PSU would be responsible for: (i) preparing, advertising and evaluating tenders, as well as
awarding contracts for the procurement of civil works, goods and services for the various entities involved in
the Project; (ii) managing the Project's special account and preparing withdrawal/replenishment applications;
(iii) keeping project accounts; (iv) having project accounts audited annually and submitting audit reports
regularly to IDA; and (v) consolidating and submitting to IDA project progress, mid-term review and
implementation completion reports as well as following up and consolidating reports on monitoring and
evaluating of project actions. The PSU would be based in Sana'a in rented quarters.

All present values are calculated at 12%.
Main Assumptions:
1. The assumptions for the seeds component are that the improved seeds produced by the seed centers will be
purchased and used by the farmers to get higher incomes. The seed centers are expected to produce good
quality seeds starting from year 5 and reaching full (capacity) development in year 10 of the project.
2. The assumptions for the fertilizer component include the use of the fertilizers by the farmers from year 3 and
that the fanners will be able to increase the yields of major crops. The expected rate of capitalization for the
import of fertilizers in the following years is half of the imports financed by the project.
3. The analysis includes all the investment and recurrent costs of the project. The recurrent costs and the costs of
the fertilizer imports in successive years are included throughout the life of the project.
4. A conversion factor of 94.8 (as provided by the MN2CO) has been used for calculating the economic prices

5. The above analysis pertains to the project entities and the country, vis-a-vis expected returns of the farmers'
benefits.
Gainers and Losers: The main objective of the project is to improve the agricultural productivity of rainfed and
irrigated crops on about 190,000 ha at full development. The measure of the benefits of the project is the
incremental productivity of farmers. In the table above, the taxes column indicates the benefits accrued by the
Government and all other direct benefits are accrued by the farmers. However, there are indirect benefits to the
consumers and the country as a whole due to additional production.
Sensitivity Analysis
a) Switching Values calculated on the basis of a discount rate of 12 percent indicate that project benefits
can be reduced by 52 percent and costs can be increased by 108 percent (in economic terms) without
reducing the ERR to below 12 percent. This confirms that the project is robust and not very sensitive
to changes in benefits and costs.
Overall Project (economic)    Overall Project (financial)
US$ Million                 US$ Million      (%)
Benefit           35.0             52.0%        33.0           43.5
Cost              17.0            108.1%         19.0          77.0
Net Benefit        18.0                          14.0
b) A sensitivity analysis indicated that droughts occuring twice every five years would reduce the NPV to
$17.7 and the ERR to 35.4 percent in economic terms and reduce the NPV to $8.5 million and the FRR
to 23.0 percent at a cost of capital at 12 percent).
c) Changes in the exchange rate and the narrowing of the gap between the official exchange rate and the
market exchange rate has increased the prices of imported and local wheat. As subsidies are being
gradually eliminated, the price of locally produced wheat would be higher than the 30 or 35 rials
presently paid by consumers and would therefore increase the financial benefits of the project.
N.B.   A detailed working paper (Working Paper No. 5) is available in the Project File. It provides the
economic and financial analysis of the Project.
