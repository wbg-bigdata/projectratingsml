A. SUMMARY

1. The proposed changes include: (a) modifications of the results framework; (b) a reallocation
   of Grants proceeds; and (c) certain changes to the percentage of financing for the IDA Grant
   and the AHI Facility Grant as well as creation of a new disbursement sub-category for the
   PHRD Grant. These modifications are necessary to respond to the project changes described
   below.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2. Progress towards achievement of the Project Development Objective is rated as Moderately
   Satisfactory, and Implementation Progress is rated as Satisfactory. Current disbursements
   stand at USD 8,585,587 or 78% for all three financing sources combined (as of September
   30, 2012).

3. The Project Development Objective (PDO) remains relevant and is a priority for the
   Kingdom of Cambodia. Continuous efforts are being made in capacity building (including
   training in rapid response, monitoring and reporting, and infection control measures) and
   institutional organization, and the pandemic preparedness procedures have been established
   and continue taking hold, together with an extension of the technical service contracts with
   the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) (for institutional strengthening and technical
   assistance in animal health, particularly avian flu) and with the World Health Organization
   (WHO) (for technical assistance and capacity building in response to the threat of avian flu).
   These steps together are contributing toward adequate progress in meeting the PDO, which
   remains achievable within the remaining project period.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

4. Results / Indicators. A change to the project performance indicators is proposed. One of
   the two original outcome indicators was that there would be “No cases of H5N1 avian
   influenza in peri-urban commercial poultry flocks once control and preventive measures
   were implemented?. This indicator was selected because cases of H5N1 avian influenza had
   occurred in this sector prior to commencement of the project and peri-urban farms were
   expected to implement new control and preventive measures developed during the life of the
   project. Cases of H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks in peri-urban poultry farms were expected
   to continue until appropriate risk reduction measures were put in place. However, since the
   commencement of the project (and before measures developed through the project were
   implemented) no H5N1 outbreaks have been reported from peri-urban commercial poultry
   farms. Continuing to report zero case in peri-urban commercial farms has no meaning
   because the 'absence of cases’ has occurred despite, not because of the project. Poultry
   outbreaks have been reported only from rural areas. This indicator will be replaced by
   another indicator relevant to the work on prevention of avian influenza in the villages

                                                4
        targeted under the ‘Healthy Livestock, Healthy Village, Better Life’ scheme. The new PDO
        indicator is “the number of villages adopting two or more disease preventive measures
        recommended under the scheme?. Baseline data were collected for this PDO during the
        initial selection of villages participating in the scheme.

5. The second outcome indicator “Evidence of improved effectiveness of participating animal
   and human health services in responding to the risk of avian influenza in poultry and a
   human pandemic of influenza? remains unchanged and relevant.

6. To measure the effectiveness of the second PDO level indicator, three intermediate sub-
   indicators are proposed to be added to the results framework on AHI outbreak rapid response
   system including: (i) percentage of suspect cases investigated (and time from reporting to
   investigation); (ii) percentage of investigated cases from which samples were collected; and
   (iii) percentage of cases tested for avian influenza and Newcastle Disease (ND).

7. For the purpose of reducing fragmentation of the World Bank financing and as part of
   sustainable exit strategy, most of the activities related to human health under Project’s Part B,
   have been transferred to be financed under the Second Health Sector Support Program
   (HSSP2) Pooled Fund starting January 2012, and a full effective is as of July 20121. The
   AHICPE Project will continue to finance the contract with WHO and a consultant for
   financial management of AHICPEP’s Part B up to the project closing date of June 30, 2013.
   HSSP2 Pooled Fund finances activities on communicable diseases, including H5N1 and
   other emerging diseases, in the areas of capacity and quality improvement, behavior change
   and communication, and operating costs. In addition, the MOH has decided to integrate the
   detection of human H5N1 cases in children into the Integrated Management of Childhood
   Illness (IMCI) at the health center level and into the Community Integrated Management and
   Childhood Illness (CIMCI) activity in provinces where cases have been detected. Village
   health volunteers (VHV) will therefore be trained in CIMCI rather than AHI alone. Hence it
   is proposed that the progress towards intermediary results indicators for Part B activities
   transferred to be financed by HSSP2 Pooled Fund will be reported in the HSSP2 semi-annual
   and annual progress reports.

8. Reallocation. The proposed reallocation is necessary to support health system sector wide
   approach through HSSP2 and provide: i) sufficient funds to the National Committee for
   Disaster Management (NCDM) to implement its activities under Part C of the project, during
   the 18-month extension period; and ii) addition funds to Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
   and Fisheries (MAFF) to expand the pilot Healthy Livestock, Healthy Village, Better Life
   program. After moving Project Part’s B Goods and IOC (funded by IDA and AHIF grants)
   financed activities to HSSP2, the savings are proposed to be reallocated to: i) cover NCDM
   Training and IOC under Part C (under IDA and AHIF grants) that are needed to cover costs
   during project extension; and ii) provide additional funds to MAFF to expand the pilot
   Healthy villages. Savings from Consultant Service category under Parts B and C (PHRD
   grant) would be used to cover training needed under these parts, for which the training
   budget had to be reduced in December 2011 restructuring due to added IOC needed to
   account for project extension. While no new training will be financed from the project under
   Part B, the reallocation will address the slight overrun that occurred in this category while
   providing necessary training as part of project activities.

9. Disbursement arrangements. There are not enough funds to finance training/workshops for
   NCDM under IDA and AHIF, while some excess funds from Consultant Services that will no
   longer be needed are available under PHRD. Therefore, a new disbursement sub-category
   will be established under the PHRD Grant Agreement to finance training/workshops for
   NCDM under Part C of the project. Additionally, the Financing Agreement and the AHI
   Facility Grant Agreement will be amended to reflect a new description of the percentage of
   financing in the withdrawal schedule.

Project Development Objective (PDO):

The project’s overall development objective is to support the implementation of the Cambodia Comprehensive AHI National Plan contributing to minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry sector
by an AHI infection in Cambodia, and to prepare for, control, and respond, if necessary, to a human influenza pandemic.
