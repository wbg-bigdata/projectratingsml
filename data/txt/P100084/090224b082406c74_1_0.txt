                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has satisfactorily achieved its PDOs as demonstrated by the following. The project supported the implementation of Cambodia’s Comprehensive AHI National Plan
                         thereby by minimizing the threat posed to humans and the poultry sector through improved efficiency of reporting and response to disease outbreaks (both avian and human) as well
                         as supporting implementation of appropriate preventive measures in poultry at the community and farm level. The number of villages that have adopted two or more disease
                         prevention measures recommended by the project has reached the end-of-project target of 30 villages, representing over 1440 households. Evidence of improved effectiveness of

                         2000 trainees have been trained using a curriculum revised by the project (target 700). Some 180 cases of disease suspected of being avian influenza were reported by VAHW in
                         2013 and 96% were investigated within 24 hours (targets 200/annum and 90%). Samples from 100% of cases (target 100%) that was consistent with avian influenza after field
                         investigations (82% of investigated cases, target 80%) were collected and transported to the National Animal Veterinary Research Institute (NaVRI) for testing for avian influenza and

                         foster inter-ministerial cooperation for pandemic preparedness, terms of reference for the National Committee for Disaster management (NCDM) were modified to include inter-
                         ministerial cooperation. A Pandemic Preparedness, Response and Recovery Program (PPRRP) has been prepared and tested. A NCDM emergency management information
                         system and monitoring and evaluation systems have been designed, developed and established, and staff trained appropriately.
