                         posed to humans and the poultry sector by AHI infection in Cambodia, and to prepare for, control, and respond if necessary to a human influenza pandemic.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project development objective (PDO) remains a priority for the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC), with the three implementing agencies (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
                         and Fishery (MAFF); Ministry of Health (MOH); and National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM)) further advancing project activities which are aimed at contributing to the
                         PDO and thus increasing likelihood of PDO being achieved during the extended implementation period (i.e., closing date has been extended from December 31, 2011 to June 30,
                         2013). The number of villages adopting two or more disease preventive measures recommended under the "Healthy Livestock, Healthy Village, Better Life scheme" is increasing.

                         There also has been improved efficiency in avian influenza reporting, surveillance, outbreak investigation and emergency response. For the first half of 2012, a total of 94 suspected
                         cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were reported, of which 80% were investigated within 24 hours. Samples were collected from 87% of the investigated cases, where
                         there was a high suspicion of HPAI, and the causative agent of the disease was detected from samples in five of these cases. Data recording on cases has also improved. With
                         regard to cases of influenza (H5N1) in humans, three cases were reported in the first half of 2012. All cases in humans and poultry which were confirmed by the Rapid Response

                         Team (RRT) were followed up within 24 hours to undertake investigations and to conduct appropriate control measures in poultry so as to ensure there was no evidence of onward
                         transmission of the virus in human.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The closing date was extended from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2013. The project restructuring cover the following: (a) replacing the first PDO indicator (as there have been no
                         cases of avian influenza reported in periurban commercial farms since project commencement) with a new PDO indicator that measures the uptake of avian influenza preventive
                         measures in villages targeted under the Healthy Livestock, Healthy Village, Better Life Scheme; (b) adding the following new intermediate results indicators (under Component A) to
                         further demonstrate the PDO focus on improved effectiveness in responding to risks of avian influenza: (i) percentage of cases investigated, including response time from report to
                         investigation; (ii) percentage of investigated cases from which samples are collected; and (iii) percentage of collected samples tested for avian influenza and Newcastle disease; (c)
                         transfer of the entire Component B to the Bank-assisted HSSP2 Project (except the MOH contract with WHO and the engagement of a National FM Consultant); and (d) re-allocation

                         of the remaining budget under Component B (MOH) to support the activities in Components A and C (MAFF and NCDM).
