INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of The Gambia in an amount equivalent to
US$5.5 million on standard IDA terms to help finance an Education Project.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economy of The Gambia" (907-GM) dated
December 12, 1975 has been circulated to the Executive Directors. Its con-
clusions are reflected and updated in the following analysis. Country data
sheets appear as Annex I.
3.        The Gambia is a narrow enclave of 10,000 km  inside Senegal along
both sides of The Gambia River. Its population of 540,000 is growing at an
annual rate of 2.4 percent. Owing to urban migration, the capital area is
growing at 4.2 percent per year. The population is predominantly illiterate
(90 percent). Economic growth has been quite respectable in the long term,
real GNP per capita having risen at almost 4 percent p.a. between 1960-75.
However, following 1975, which was a record year, per capita output declined
owing in large part to a leveling off and subsequent decline in the production
of groundnuts, on which the economy is heavily dependent. GNP per capita
in 1976 was $180 and is estimated to have gone down somewhat in 1977, when
poor weather affected both groundnuts and foodcrops. The fall in the value of
the Dalasi, which is pegged to the British pound, from 56 US cents in 1975 to
about 45 cents in 1976 and 1977, also lowered GNP expressed in US dollars
during this period, while deteriorations in the terms of trade reduced real
income even further.
4.        The economy consists mostly of traditional smallholder rural activi-
ties: agriculture, livestock and fisheries account for 60 percent of the
country's total GDP and employ about 85 percent of the active population.
Agriculture is mostly rainfed, characterized by a short production period
limited to the six months of the rainy season, and dominated by groundnuts,
which are almost the only cash crop of The Gambia. Groundnuts are the main
source of foreign exchange and constitute the basis for the country's major
industrial activity, groundnut oil milling. Millet, sorghum, cassava and more
recently rice are the major food crops, and cattle raising is an important
economic activity. Income per capita of the urban population, estimated at
US$470, is 3.6 times higher than that of the rural population (US$130).
5.        The Gambian economy is influenced by certain important structural
weaknesses: (a) low productivity of the rural sector; (b) wide seasonal



-2-
fluctuations in output and employment (there is full employment at the height
_i ti.e agricultural season but this is followed by six months of sharply
reduced activity in most economic sectors, including trade, transport, and
industry, all linked to groundnuts1); and (c) extreme vulnerability to varia-
tions in groundnut prices and production levels (the latter essentially a
function of rainfall).
Recent Developments
6.        The government has undertaken both to increase productivity of the
rural sector and to diversify agriculture in order to reduce its dependence
on grotndnuts. It has developed irrigated rice along the Gambia River, cotton
in the east and vegetables around the urban areas. For instance the IDA-
financed Irrigated Rice Project is estimated to have increased rice production
of 1,500 families by 5,000 tons p.a. (about 12 percent of national consumption
requirements of rice). To provide a sound basis for its agricultural develop-
ment strategy, in 1972 the government requested the U.K. to conduct a nation-
wide land resource survey which was completed in February 1975. This led to
the ongoing IDA-financed Rural Development Project, which covers about
half the farms in the country and concentrates on improvement of rainfed
cultivation of millet, sorghum and groundnuts. Other rice and foodcrop
development programs are under preparation.
7.        The Government has also actively promoted the establishment of
hotels, mostly with private financing, by ensuring provision of infrastructure
facilities, participating in the equity of some of these enterprises, and
granting tax holidays and other incentives. These activities have had a bene-
ficial impact on the balance of payments and have resulted in the creation
of about 2,000 jobs (about 10 percent of employment in the modern sector).
Although this employment is seasonal, it occurs during periods of low agricul-
tural employment. To mobilize savings and channel credit to local entre-
preneurs, the Government established in 1972 The Gambia Commercial and
Development Bank (GCDB). As a first attempt to spur small industries, it
created the Indigenous Business Advisory service in 1975.
8.        Economic performance, however, continues to be dominated by the
groundnut sector. In 1975 high prices and yields raised output, exports and
incomes markedly after the Sahel drought. In 1976, groundnut production
leveled off and export prices fell by 15 percent, while import prices rose by
a comparable amount. These factors resulted in a substantial deficit in the
current account of the balance of payments, notwithstanding low import growth
in real terms. In 1977 there was a decline in groundnut output, but export
prices were favorable. Imports again rose slowly in real terms, but there
was still a sizeable current account deficit as the cost of imports was pushed
up both by higher world prices and the decline in the value of the Dalasi.
Throughout this period of low growth and rising import costs the Government
nevertheless managed to maintain a satisfactory overall financial position,
as capital inflows financed most of the current account deficits and foreign
exchange reserves, though declining, were kept above 4 months of imports.
With respect to public finance, current expenditures were held below current



-3-
budget revenues, and modest budgetary savings were available for public
investment.
Development Prospects and Constraints
9.        During 1975-1985 GDP is projected to grow by only 2.5 percent p.a.,
about the same rate as population growth, with very low growth in the first
five years of the period, and growth of about 4.0 percent p.a. between 1980-
85. The main factors behind this outlook are the very slow average growth of
groundnuts, which will be depressed by unfavorable long term price trends,
and more rapid growth of food crops, services, and small-scale enterprises in
the early 1980s. The long-term decline in groundnut prices together with
increases in the cost of imports mean that The Gambia will face a deteriora-
tion in terms of trade and a loss of real purchasing power. Whereas gross
domestic income was 8 percent higher than GDP in 1974, in 1980 it is expected
to be 13 percent lower.
10.       The Government is implementing its first Five-Year Development Plan
which covers the 1976-80 period. This Plan gives greater emphasis to the
productive sectors, agriculture and industry, than in the preceding four-year
program (40 percent of total investment compared with 17 percent). It also
includes urban and transport infrastructure and stresses the development of
skilled manpower. The Plan provides for gross public investment of US$67
million (1975 prices). This corresponds to annual expenditures of about 11
percent of GDP, a sharp increase over the past when total public investment
averaged only 5-6 percent of GDP. A major addition has been made to the
Plan with the Farafenni Dam, estimated to cost US$56 million.
11.       Lack of skilled manpower is one of the major bottlenecks hindering
economic development and has slowed down the preparation and execution of
development projects in the past. The Plan will include a human resources
development program which aims at creating in the shortest possible time
a stock of trained manpower at all levels. The Infrastructure and Tourism
Project as well as the ongoing Rural Development Project both have substan-
tial training components. The Government requested the assistance of the
Association in formulating and financing the present project to help train
skilled manpower and make the education system more responsive to the labor
market.
Financial Prospects and Foreign Aid
12.       The financing needed to implement the Development Plan is expected
to come from a combination of foreign aid, drawing down of existing reserves,
and public savings generated during the Plan period. In recent years the
Government has managed to generate small budgetary surpluses as a result of
its efforts to improve tax collection and restrain the growth of recurrent
expenditures. Assuming that groundnut prices decline as forecast, the Gambia
Produce Marketing Board will be unable to generate significant surpluses over
the Plan period. Public savings, which reached a high of US$17 million after
debt service in 1974 are expected to be much lower over the Five-Year Plan
period. Development expenditure will also be less than planned, as the



- 4 -
Government decided to postpone projects for which financing in the current
year had not been fully secured. The Government is studying, with the
help of the IMF, fiscal reform in order to improve revenues. Finally, the
Revenue Fund, financed with earlier budgetary surpluses and Marketing Board
contributions, is not yet depleted.
13.       Foreign aid increased sharply over the past three years:  from US$7
million in 1976 to US$15 million in 1977. Disbursements in 1978 are forecast
to be US$19 million. Donors from OPEC countries have increased their commit-
ment from US$0.3 million in 1975 to US$22.7 million in 1978. IDA disburse-
ments represented 7 percent of disbursements in 1976, 6 percent in 1977 and
will not exceed 8 percent in 1978.
14.       Our projections show that Government should be able to finance at
most about 20 percent of its present Five-Year Development Plan. However,
these projections are particularly sensitive to the groundnut situation. A
single bad crop, a slower rate of growth in groundnut output, a drop in
groundnut prices beyond forecasts or a combination of these factors could
seriously affect the realization of the Plan's objectives. The Government is
therefore justified in seeking external financing on concessionary terms as
well as the foreign financing of Local costs in appropriate cases. With a
continuation of present policies we expect The Gambia to be successful in
mobilizing the necessary finance on appropriate terms; accordingly debt
service will not impose an unduly heavy burden on budgetary receipts. Because
of the diversification of foreign aid donors, the exposure of IDA is expected
to decrease from 40 percent of total outstanding debt in 1973/74 to 20 percent
in 1985.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE GAMBIA
15.       To date the Bank Group has financed four operations in The Gambia
totalling US$13.9 million of which US$6.5 million has been disbursed as of
February 28, 1978. One credit of US$2.1 million in FY70 (187-GM) was for
rehabilitation of the port of Banjul, essential for a country so vitally
dependent on foreign trade; due to a sharp increase in construction costs
following project appraisal, a US$2.4 million supplementary credit was added
in FY74. The second operation involved a US$1.3 million credit (333-GM) for
the irrigation of 3,000 ha under rice cultivation and for the preparation of
a follow-up project. A third involvement, for which a US$4.0 million credit
(602-GM) was signed January 12, 1976, focuses on the development of the
tourism sector in which The Gambia has some comparative advantage; it more-
over aims at improving public utilities in both Banjul and suburban areas.
Finally, during FY76 IDA approved a credit of US$4.1 million (644-GM) for a
Rural Development Project, co-financed by ODM and BADEA. The project is aimed
at improving agricultural extension services, transport and marketing infra-
structure, and would provide training and agricultural credit for farmers.
Project implementation in The Gambia has been generally satisfactory. Notes
on the execution of ongoing project:s are presented in Annex II.



-5-
16.       Medium and long-term credit is virtually unknown in The Gambia
except in specific crop development projects. To stimulate further develop-
ment in agriculture, agro-industries, small-scale enterprises and housing
construction, IDA has just appraised a DFC project for The Gambia Commercial
and Development Bank. Recently, road construction has been the focus of
considerable attention from a variety of external aid agencies, particularly
from Arab funds. Already, close to 90 percent of the primary and feeder
roads proposed in the present Five-Year Plan have received commitment for
financing of studies and construction. However, present road maintenance
operations are not sufficient to adequately maintain the existing network.
At the request of the government IDA is preparing a highway maintenance
project which would include technical assistance and training, procurement
of equipment, and rehabilitation of about 200 km of laterite roads.
17.       The education project proposed in this report would assist the
Government in improving secondary education, strengthening educational admin-
istration and planning, expanding the training of skilled workers, techni-
cians and para-medical personnel and upgrading middle-level managers and
administrators.
PART III: THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Structure
18.       The Gambian education system is patterned on the British education
system and still maintains strong links with it in terms of examinations,
standards and professional qualifications. Primary school is six years, and
beginning in school year 1976/77 the admission age was raised from 7 to 8.
Secondary school consists of four years in secondary technical school or five
years in secondary high school. Admission to secondary school is regulated by
an entrance examination. About 40 percent of the pupils enrolled in primary
grade 6 pass this examination and continue to secondary school. Recruitment
for the five post-secondary institutions in The Gambia is done among secondary
high school graduates (grade 11) for the Teacher Training College, the School
of Nursing and the School of Public Health, and among secondary technical
school graduates (grade 10) for the Vocational Training Center and the Agri-
cultural and Technical Center. University education is not available in The
Gambia.
Administration
19.       The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports has two departments:
the Department of Education, directed by a Chief Education Officer, and the
Department of Youth and Sports. The administrative structure of the Depart-
ment of Education is small; it consists of a central administrative unit,
an inspection unit, a small but efficient statistical office, and a recently
established curriculum development center. The Department has no educational
planning capacity, and planning generally occurs on an ad hoc basis under the



- 6 -
direction of the Chief Education Of'ficer. Administration and supervision of
the school system is centralized in, Banjul. The reluctance of supervisory
staff to travel up-country and diff'iculties in communications and transporta-
tion generally result in inadequate support for the rural schools. A scheme
to decentralize certain administrative functions has made a modest start with
the recent appointment of four regional education officers.
Access to Education
20.       Total enrollment in primary schools is about 25,500 pupils (1976/77),
representing 33 percent of the 7-12 age group. There are striking geographic
disparities in the access to education: in the urban Banjul-Kombo area where
15 percent of the population live, about 82 percent of the eligible children
are enrolled in primary school; this ratio drops to about 24 percent for the
rural areas. Total enrollment in secondary schools is about 6,800 students
(1976/77), representing about 15 percent of the 13-17 age group. At the
secondary level, like the primary, schools are also concentrated in Banjul:
five of the 16 secondary technical schools and five of the seven secondary
high schools are located there. Access to formal public education in rural
areas is restricted by the lack of school buildings and by prevailing atti-
tudes of Muslim parents, who often prefer to send their children to a Koranic
school. The Government is trying to increase public school enrollment by
providing for religious (Koranic) instruction in the primary and secondary
schools. Thirty-two percent of the pupils in primary schools are girls,
representing 23 percent of the 7-12 female population. In secondary schools
30 percent of the pupils are girls, representing 19 percent of the 13-17
female population. There are considerable regional fluctuations in the
participation of girls: in Banjul, 48 percent of the primary pupils are
girls, while in the rural Lower River Division, for economic and religious
reasons, only 17 percent of the primary pupils are female.
Quality of Education
21.       The quality of primary education is generally low, particularly
outside the urban Banjul-Kombo area.. There is no official curriculum, but
a curriculum development center supported by UNDP has started to develop one
for the primary grades. The quality of many school buildings in rural areas
is very poor. Few schools have furniture and the provision of school books
and supplies is inadequate. Only 54 percent of the 830 primary school
teachers have been trained for their jobs; the proportion of trained teachers
decreases in the rural areas. Pedagogical and administrative supervision of
schools in rural areas is infrequent.
22.       The secondary high schools are generally well organized and ade-
quately staffed. The secondary technical schools located in Banjul are
in suitable buildings that are reasonably well equipped, but those located in
rural areas lack adequate facilities and equipment for teaching science and
practical subjects. In addition, the four-year program offered by these
schools is deficient in scientific and skill content. The Government has
decided to extend the program from f'our to five years and to give the cur-
ricula a more practical orientation. Teachers for practical and science
courses are available in The Gambia, but they generally need to be upgraded.



- 7 -
23.        The principal institution for pre-employment vocational training
is the Vocational Training Center (VTC) in Banjul, which offers one- and
two-year courses in a number of basic trades. The technical teaching staff
is qualified and experienced, but the VTC is housed in small and dilapidated
buildings and the available staff and equipment are not adequate to conduct
the additional training courses needed to meet the demand for skilled workers.
Financing of Education
24.        Government expenditures for education, which are about 1.6 percent
of GNP and about 15 percent of the budget, are low by West African standards,
where these expenditures generally range from 3 to 5 percent of GNP and 20 to
30 percent of the budget. The Government has been increasing expenditures for
education in recent years but most of the increase has been absorbed by higher
teacher salaries, and has not resulted in an expansion of the system. Unit
costs have increased accordingly: in 1974/75 the direct per pupil costs were
estimated at US$24 for primary schools and US$48 for secondary technical
schools; the 1976/77 budgeted costs were US$57 and US$87, respectively. In
1976/77, the allocation for teachers' salaries was approximately 78 percent of
the education budget, about 20 percent was spent on student accommodation and
allowances, while the provision for books, equipment and supplies was only 2
percent.
Government Strategy - Education
25.        The Government's most important policy objectives for education
and training over the ten-year period 1976-1986 are to upgrade the quality
of education, particularly at the primary and secondary levels, improve access
to education for the rural population, and better align education and training
with employment needs. To address these objectives, Government is consider-
ing: (a) doubling primary school enrollment and introducing a new primary
school curriculum; (b) improving secondary technical school curricula and
providing basic skill training programs at the secondary level to better equip
students for informal sector employment or self-employment; (c) concentrating
on qualitative improvements at the post-secondary level and relating job-
specific skill training more closely to labor market needs. Expansion of
primary education is an important objective but Government is taking a cau-
tious approach due to financial constraints and the need to plan and implement
an effective expansion program. To assess its educational programs and
formulate a long-range strategy for education development, Government intends
to establish a planning unit within the Ministry of Education. In addition,
to coordinate manpower and training requirements on a national scale, Govern-
ment has decided to strengthen the National Vocational Training Board which
was established in 1966 under the President's Office.  This Board would set
overall training policy, identify needs in all sectors of the economy, coor-
dinate vocational training programs, prepare legislation setting up formal
apprentice schemes, and be responsible for the operation of some of the
country's vocational training facilities.



-8-
Government Strategy - Health Training
26.       In the health sector, the Five-Year Development Plan emphasizes the
improvement of basic rural health services through upgrading existing health
centers and establishing new rural health centers and clinics. The additional
personnel needed to staff these facilities will be mainly at the lower and
middle level and will include nurses, midwives, sanitary inspectors and other
auxiliary health personnel. To implement this proposed program of expansion
of health facilities and staff training, the Government intends to strengthen
the planning capacity of the Ministry of Health and expand the training of
para-medical personnel.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
27.       Discussions with the Gambian Government on priorities in the educa-
tion sector began with an IDA mission that visited the country in November
1975. This was followed, in May 1!976, by an IDA mission that started prep-
aration of a project for IDA financing. Detailed preparation of the major
project components was completed by consultants employed by the Government
and financed under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF), and by technical
assistance provided through the UNI1P. The proposed project was appraised in
April 1977 by an IDA mission. Negotiations were held in Washington from March
6 to 10, 1978, with a Gambian delegation led by Dr. J. A. Langley, Permanent
Secretary, Ministry of Economic Planning and Industrial Development. A Staff
Appraisal Report [No. 1711a-GM] is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. The attached map [IBRD 13094R) shows the project area.

Project Description
29.       The project would comprise:
(a) Construction, furniture and equipment for:
i. a technical institute;
ii. a training center for auxiliary nursers, an extension
to the School of Nursing, and two small hostels for
nursing staff on field training;
iii. a management development institute;
iv. 30 specialist rooms for science, technology and
practical work at four secondary technical schools
and one secondary high school; and
v. three regional education centers and a production
unit for school furniture;
(b) Equipment and materials for an educational planning unit
and a project unit; and
(c) Provision of 19 man-years of technical assistance and
consulting services, and 50 man-years of fellowships for
items (a)i, ii, iii, iv and (b).
30.       Three man-years of technical assistance would be provided for esta-
blishing the Technical Institute and 8 man-years of fellowships would be used
for technical upgrading and teacher training of local instructors. The Insti-
tute would train apprentices, upgrade skilled workers and offer pre-employment
training in mechanical, automotive and construction trades. The Institute
would maintain links with employers through a National Vocational Training
Board which would set training policy, identify training needs and coordinate
vocational training on a national scale. The Institute would be managed by a
Board of Governors representing the public and private sectors. The Board
of Governors would be established not later than January 31, 1979 and would
be placed under the President's Office [Schedule 2(A) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement].
31.       In addition to construction of health training facilities, provision
would be made for 2 man-years of technical assistance to help plan and imple-
ment the expansion of health delivery in the rural areas and 6 man-months of
consultant services for training program design. The expanded School of Nurs-
ing in Banjul would be used to train graduate and auxiliary nurses and for in-
service training of middle and lower-level health staff, especially for rural
health centers. The proposed auxiliary nurses training center would train
lower-level auxiliary personnel to staff rural clinics and health centers
being upgraded or expanded. An appropriate curriculum for auxiliary nursing
training would be submitted to IDA for review not later than January 31, 1980,



- 10 -
and a study of the infrastructure, manpower requirements and recurrent cost
implications of the proposed expansion of the health system would be sub-
mitted to IDA for review not later than January 31, 1981 [Schedule 2(B) of
the draft Development Credit Agreement].
32.       The project would provide 3 man-years of technical assistance to
help establish the Management Development Institute and 3 man-months of
consultant support for program design. The Institute would train middle-
level managers and administrators for the public and para-public sectors,
and offer programs in general management and administration, office manage-
ment, personnel supervision and business finance. The Institute would be
managed by a Board of Governors representing central government, local
councils, public corporations and private enterprise. The Board of Gov-
ernors would be established not later than January 31, 1979 under the Office
of the President [Schedule 2(C) of ithe draft Development Credit Agreement].
33.       In connection with the establishment of 30 specialist teaching
areas for technical education in secondary schools, 40 man-years of fellow-
ships would be provided to train and upgrade science and practical subject
teachers. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
that detailed proposals for a science and technical teacher training program
would be submitted to IDA for review not later than December 31, 1978 and de-
tailed curricula for science and practical subjects for secondary technical
schools would be developed and submitted to IDA for review not later than
September 30, 1980 [Schedule 2(D) of the draft Development Credit Agreement].
34.       In addition to the construiction of regional education centers and a
furniture production unit, two man-years of technical assistance would be
used to set up an educational planning unit, 1 man-year of specialist services
would assist in developing future education and training projects and 2 man-
years of felklwships would train a local educator in planning and statistics.
The planning unit would be established no later than September 30, 1978 and
its first task would be to prepare a school map and formulate, not later than
July 31, 1980, a detailed plan for expanding primary education in rural areas.
The regional education centers would provide an administrative base for the
regional education officers, and the production unit would manufacture and
repair simple school furniture [Schedule 2(E) and (F) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement].
Project Cost and Financing
35.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$6.5 million, net
of tax. The foreign exchange cost, estimated at US$5.5 million and represent-
ing about 85 percent of the project cost, would be financed by the IDA credit.
The balance of US$1.0 million and an additional US$.5 million in taxes, would
be financed by the Government. Retroactive financing of up to US$100,000 is
recommended to pay for the cost of establishing the project unit and the cost
of preparing architectural working drawings and tender documents during the
period between credit negotiations and credit signature. The estimated
average cost of construction per square meter, including site development, is
US$190 for the secondary school addiitions, and US$250 for the other project



- 11 -
institutions. This compares favorably with prevailing costs for contracts
awarded for similar construction in Sierra Leone and Liberia. The estimated
unit cost per student place for the major project institutions is US$1,625 for
the secondary schools and US$4,675 for the Technical Institute. These figures
are about average for similar institutions in the region. The estimated cost
of technical assistance, based on recruitment experience of international
organizations and bilateral agencies is US$60,000 per man-year.
Project Implementation
36.       The project would be implemented between 1978 and 1983.  A project
unit would be established within the Ministry of Economic Planning and Indus-
trial Development and would be responsible for the implementation and admin-
istration of the project. The project unit staff would consist of a project
coordinator, an accountant, two clerks of works, a procurement officer to be
financed by the Government, and a project manager and a project architect to
be recruited internationally and financed from the proceeds of the credit.
The project unit would be established and the project coordinator appointed
before credit effectiveness. The project unit would be advised by an inter-
ministerial coordinating committee representing all government agencies and
departments concerned with the project. The coordinating committee would be
established not later than July 31, 1978 [Schedule 2 of the draft Development
Credit Agreement].
Procurement and Disbursement
37.       Civil works valued at US$3.1 million, and furniture, equipment and
vehicles valued at US$1.1 million would be procured on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with IDA's guidelines. Domestic
contractors would be given a preference of 7-1/2 percent in the evaluation of
bids for civil works. Domestic manufacturers of furniture and equipment would
be allowed a preferential margin of 15 percent of the CIF price of competing
imports or the total applicable customs duties and import taxes, whichever is
lower. Furniture, equipment, vehicles and other items which cannot be grouped
in packages of at least US$50,000 equivalent each, or which are not suitable
for international competitive bidding, would be procured by inviting quota-
tions from reliable suppliers or in accordance with local competitive bidding
procedures satisfactory to IDA. The value of such items would not exceed
US$0.2 million. Disbursements from the credit account would cover (a) 70
percent of the total civil works expenditures; (b) 100 percent of foreign
expenditures for directly imported, 70 percent of expenditures for imported
but locally procured and 100 percent of the ex-factory cost of locally manu-
factured furniture, equipment and vehicles; (c) 100 percent of total expendi-
tures for professional services, technical assistance and fellowships. The
credit also includes US$40,000 to refund the PPF advance [Schedule 3 of the
draft Development Credit Agreement].
Project Benefits and Risks
38.       The shortage of skilled and literate manpower is one of the prin-
cipal development constraints in The Gambia. The proposed project would



- 12 -
support the Government's education and training policies and help to over-
come manpower constraints by (a) training and upgrading skilled workers,
technicians, managers and administrators, and middle-level health personnel,
(b) improving the quality of secondary education, and (c) helping to plan
for the expansion of primary education to rural areas. The project does not
specifically address the needs of women, but it would have a positive impact
on the status of women by (i) helping to plan for improved access to rural
primary education; (ii) improving secondary and post-secondary instruction in
practical subjects, including home economics; and (iii) improving the delivery
of health services, including maternal care, especially in rural areas. The
project does not present any unusual risks.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of The
Gambia and the Association and the Recommendation of the Committee provided in
Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
40.       Features of the Development Credit Agreement of special interest
are listed in Section III of Annex III. Special conditions of effectiveness
are that the Government will (i) formally establish, under the President's
office, the proposed Technical Institute to be managed by a Board of Gov-
ernors, with terms of reference acceptable to IDA and (ii) establish the
project unit and appoint the project coordinator (Section 5.01 (a) and (b) of
the Draft Development Credit Agreement).
41.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
42.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.
