Beneficiaries:       Government of Uttar Pradesh (COUP) and up to 30 towns
in Uttar Pradesh (UP); and Canga Project Directorate
(GPD) and four or more towns in Bihar, UP, and West
Bengal.
Amount:               Bank Loan : US$20 Million
IDA Credit:  SDR 106.3 Million (Us$130*0 M equivalent)
Terms:                Bank Loan : Repayment over 20 years including five
years' grace, at applicable rate of
interest.
IDA Credit:  Standard.
Relending Terms:      From GOI to GOUP:  As part of central assistance to
states for development projects on terms and conditions
applicable at the time.
From COUP to the development authorities, municipal
corporations or boards, town water and sewerage
authorities, in about 30 urban areas for:
(i)   technical assistance:  grants;
(ii)  low cost sanitation:  50X grants;
(iii) slum upgrading:  grants up to Rs 250/capita;
(iv)  community facilities in sites and services: grants
and
(v)   other project activities:   at 8.75% p.a. interest
over 20 years including five years' grace period

to beneficiaries at not less than 12X p.a. over
varying periods of time.



-ii- 
From GOI to GPD: grants.
Prom GPD to designated implementing agencies in Bihar,
UP, and West Bengal: grants.
GOI would bear the foreign exchange risk.
Project Description: The project would: (a) support policy adjustments,
institutional strengthening, and urban shelter and
infrastructure developments initiated by COUP; and (b)
address sector policy improvements to support GPD at the
national level by strategic planning for pollution
reduction and control in the Ganga River.
The project comprises two distinct programs: the UP
Program, and the Ganga Program. The UP Program would
support: (e) sector management, technical assistance and
training, sites and services, slum upgrading, area
development, water suRply, sewerage and sewage treatment,
drainage, low cost sanitation, solid waste management,
maintenance management, and traffic engineering and
management, in about 12 urban areas in the state, and (b)
low cost sanitation investments in a further 18 towns
where UNDP/TAG feasibility studies have already been
carried out. This program would focus on improving urban
management, and operations and maintenance of investments,
including improved resource mobilization and utilization.
The Ganga program would provide consulting services,
studies, training, priority rehabilitation and pollution
control works, and equipment for sewer cleaning operations
and river monitoring to reduce pollution of the Canga
River.
The potential zisks of the UP program are: (a) the
capacity of UP's Investment Planning and Monitoring Cell
(IPMC) to manage the project; (b) the institutional
capacity of town agencies to implement a multi-sector
investment program; and (c) non-compliance b- GOUP and
project towns of policy conditions relating to cost
recovery and resource mobilization. However, GOUP has
staffed the IPMC with its most experienced
multi-discipline officers who are familiar with
programmed activities. Project towns would implement
an operational action plan, supplemented by
training, to strengthen their institutional capacity.
GOUP and project towns have already demonstrated a firm
commiitment to objectives by having increased
substantially, water tariffs and water and sewer taxes



-iii-
substantially, water tariffs and water and sewer taxes
and charges. The potential risks of the Ganga program
are low since CPD will be engaging specialist
consulting services to support its core team.
Implementation will be carried out by competent
authorities at the state level.

I. S5CTOR BACKCROUND
A.  India - National Urbanization Trends and Management
1.01    India's cities and towns are growing rapidly.  The increase in urban
population from 107 million in 1971 (20% of total population) to 156 million
in 1981 (24% of the total) marked an acceleration in the annual rate of urban
growth to 3.9% from 3.3% in the previous decade. By the year 2000, India's
urban population will have more than doubled, reaching a total of at least
325 million. In the next 15 years, more than half of India's population
growth will occur in urban areas.
1.02    There is a growing realization in India that urban development is an
important part of economic development and that past efforts to contain urban
growth may have been counterproductive. Increasing attention is therefore
being given to the development of more appropriate urban sector policies and
to the strengthening of sector institutions. Better management of urban
growth is now a priority of both the Government of India (GOI) and the State
Governments, with three principal objectives: (a) to support the expanding
urban economy of India; (b) to alleviate urban poverty; and (c) to improve
living conditions.
1.03    Within these objectives1 the State Governments, with whom the primary
responsibility for urban development rests, emphasize four broad themes *which
characterize urban sector policies: (a) increased efficiency and effective-
ness of resource utilization, (b) improved pricing, cost recovery, and local
resource mobilization, (c) more rational allocation of sector respon-
sibilities between the private and public sectors, and (d) strengthening of
public sector management.
1.04    Resource Utilization:  Design standards are being modified and lower
cost technologies are being adopted for public sector land development, water
supply, sanitation, transport, and other municipal services to make invest-
ments affordable. This permits coverage to be expanded, costs to be
recovered, and sector subsidies to be reduced. It is also recognized that
existing facilities must be better utilized, which requires improved main-
tenance and more efficient operations (e.g., reduced leakage and wastage in
water supply systems, improved traffic management, etc.).
1.05    Improved resource utilization is the policy area in which the most
progress has been made. Affordable and replicable approaches have been
identified and are being incorporated into individual investment projects and
into some statewide investment programs. However, widespread application
is hampered by weaknesses in resource mobilization and sector management.
Also, while good progress is being made in making new investments more
cost-effective, progress is slower in improving the operation and maintenance
of existing facilities.
1.06    Resource Mobilization:  Policy formulation and action to improve
resource mobilization in the urban sector is under way. There are three
principal areas of-emphasis: (a) pricing of public sector land and housing,
where full cost recovery from beneficiaries is increasingly accepted,
although interest rates remain low (except in Bank-supported projects where



-2-
interest of 121 or more is being charged); (b) tariff setting for public
utilities, such as water supply, sewerage, and transport, where the principle
of full cost recovery is also becoming accepted; and (c) mobilization of
general municipal revenues, and particularly property tax revenues, where
less progress has been made.
1.07    The mobilization of additional municipal tax revenues will require
that comprehensive programs be designed and implemented to address a number
of inter-related issues which are administratively complex and politically
sensitive, including mapping and land registration, property value assess-
ments, rate setting, billing, and collection. Property values are typically
assessed on the basis of rents, which are kept artificially low because of
rent control. Hence, a new basis for property valuation, and rent control
reforms are cautiously being pursued by GOI and some State Governments.
1.08    Sector Management:  Sector management needs to be strengthened at
three levels: central, state, and local (municipal). At the central level,
the concerned GOI sector ministry was reorganized in 1985 and renamed the
Ministry of Urban Development (formerly Works and Housing) to reflect better
the emerging broader emphasis on urban policy. The role of the existing
Housing and Urban Development Corporation of India (HUDCO) may be expanded.
HUDCO is currently the only central level agency performing the role of
financial intermediary for a Bank-supported project in the urban and water
supply sector (the Madhya Pradesh Urban Development Project). In 1985, GOI
also established the Central Ganga Authority (CGA) to assist the states along
the Ganga in reducing river pollution, principally by improving sewerage and
sanitation in urban areas. The Ganga Project Directorate (GPD) within the
CGA is responsible for the preparation of action plans for the cleanup of the
Canga River. Early in 1986, GOI also established a national Urban
Infrastructure Finance Corporation to provide both financial and policy
support to State Governments and sector agencies. A proposal is under con-
sideration to establish a National Housing Bank during the Seventh Plan
period. The above are examples of India's new found resolve to build a
coherent urban policy and a sound framework for its execution.
1.09    At the state level, some progress has been made in strengthening
sector management. In most states, agencies now exist for housing, water
supply and sanitation, etc. They are essentially construction agencies whose
capacity for broader sector planning and management functions is being
strengthened in only a few states. An adjustment in their mandate and out-
look is required. Equally important, State Governments themselves need to
be better organized and staffed to plan or economic development and to
address urban sector issues and opportunities as part of their economic
development programs, rather than as isolated physical planning subjects.
1.10    Less progress in strengthening sector management has been made at the
municipal level. However, valuable experience has been gained and demonstra-
tion of new policies and approaches has taken place through Bank-supported
projects, providing a good basis for a broader strengthening program. State
Covernments have previously adopted a relatively centralized approach to
local issueo, preferring to carry out development programs through state
level bodies, thereby often bypassing and weakening local governments and



-3-
community groups. There is now a growing realization that a more decentral-
ized approach must be adopted ii the managemenc, investment, and maintenance
requirements of India's 3500 cities and towns are to be met.  Local initia-
tive and local resources must be stimulated and mobilized to a greater extent
than has been the case to date. This is a major policy theme of the Seventh
Plan.
1.11    Rational Allocation of Sector Responsibilities.  There are tuo
sub-sectors in which the role of the private sector clearly needs to be
strengthened in Indias shelter and urban transport. It is now generally
accepted that house construction itself should be left to the private sector,
with the public sector focusing on the provision of trunk infrastructure and,
selectively, on land assembly and on-site infrastructure for low-income
households and small businesses. The need to adjust the legal and financial
framework accordingly is beginning to be accepted, and adjustments are being
considered and introduced (e.g., reform of rent control and urban land ceil-
ing legislation, reform of land use and building control regulations
applicable to the private sector, and strengthening of housing finance
institutions). In transport, there is limited although growing acceptance of
the need to liberalize policies on the licensing of private bus operators,
and some states are moving in this direction.
B. Urbanization Trends in Uttar Pradesh
1.12    Uttar Pradesh is the fourth largest state in India, covering 9% of
the total area of the country. It is, however, first in population, with 111
million, according to the 1981 census, and has about 17% of India's popula-
tion. The 1981 urban population of Uttar Pradesh was about 20 million, or
18% of the state's population, and grew at the rate of 4.9% a year during
the period 1971-1981, compared to the all-India urban population growth of
3.9% ovsr the same period. The greatest increase in growth rate has been ;n
towns of under 20,000 population. Almost half of this increase is migration
from rural areas, especially from the less developed Eastern and Hill
regions. About one million persons per year are being added to UP's urban
population and on the basis of present projections, by 2001 the urban popula-
tion could exceed 52 million, or 30% of the state's population. The UP urban
population is widely dispersed in about 660 cities and towns, indicating the
need for decentralization of urban development responsibilities to the local
level and to the private sector, with State Government interventions focused
on the establishmentt of broad policies and on an appropriate framework of
incentives. State level bodies cannot mobilize either the financial or the
managerial resources required for direct intervention in all urban areas.
1.13    Although the economy of the state is primarily agricultural, with 52%
of the State Domestic Product (SDP) originating in agriculture and allied
sectors compared to 40% for India as a whole, urbanization is becoming impor-
tant. For many decades, economic growth in the state lagged behind the rest
of India. Recently, however, the economy has expanded at a rate of about 6Z,
which equals or exceeds the growth rate of the national economy. Some of the
industrial sectors, su:h as chemicals, machinery, transport equipment,
non-metallic products and miscellaneous manufacturing, which are
predominantly urban in their location and characteristics, show particularly



-4-
rapid growth. It is clearly becoming more important to provide an efficient
urban environment as an incentive to growth for industry and commerce in the
state. Further details of the economy of the state and urban services are
attached as Annex 1.
1.14    Urban growth has taken place in the context of an inadequate public
utility infrastructure. The problems of urban growth are all the more severe
in the largest cities because of the greater absolute number of people
involved.  About 45% of the urban population does not have access to a safe
water supply, 55% have no access to electricity, and 27% have no access to
latrine facilities. Local government services, auch as solid waste manage-
ment, night soil collection and disposal, and street cleaning and lighting
are poor, particularly in low-income areas. State provision of developed
land and shelter falls far short of needs. The UP Housing and Development
Board, whose jurisdiction extends to 113 cities and towns in the state,
completes about 1200 housing units and plots a year. Annual requirements for
new shelter alone are about 70,000 units/plots.
1.15    Urban Investment Requirements.  UP has given increasing emphasis to
urban development in recent Five Year Plans, as Table 1.1 indicates. Between
the Fifth and Sixth Plans, for instance, the amount allocated rose threefold.
The amounts, however, fall far short of needs. Based on recent national
estimates of investment requirements for providing "adequate" levels of urban
services (in water supply, sewerage/sanitation, solid waste, storm drainage,
roads, street lighting, and associated land development) for the urban
population up to the year 2001, including filling the existing backlog, and
the replacement of worn out infrastructure (assuming here a 40 year life
expectancy), UP would require about Rs 6,000 crores (equivalent US$4,615
million) in 1986 prices. On this basis, the average annual requirement for
its current (1985-1990) Five Year Plan would be about Rs 2,000 crores. This
would be the equivalent of 19% of UP's total current (Seventh) Five Year Plan
allocation. GOUP has allocated 4%. Although full funding requirements for
the sector are not likely to be realized, the increasing emphasis given to
urban development is timely and should be pursued.

1.16    Sector Policy Adjustments.  In 1984, in order to provide the back-
ground necessary for making sectoral policy adjustments, GOUP carried out an
extensive review of the urban sector. IDA reviewed this document and is in
agreement with its conclusions. Drawing also on the lessons learned from the
two Bank-supported projects (see para 1.17), COUP revised its urban sector
policies and prepared an action plan for the implementation of necessary
policy adjustments. These focused on improved cost recovery and local
resource mobilization, a shift of housing construction to the private sector,
relaxation of constraints on private bus operations in urban areas, relaxa-
tion of rent control, and greater reliance on local community initiative and
resources. COUP and local authorities have already made good progress in
introducing the policy adjustments and in implementing the action plan.
Principal steps taken to date include:
Pricing "An  Cost Recover    (i) COUP has rescinded its freeze on
increases in water charges. A number of towns, including all the
proposed project towns, have raised tariffs (increases ranged from 50%
to 200%) and water and sewer taxes (increases ranged from 12X to 100%);
(ii) all project agencies have begun enforcement of the collection of
arrears of general tax, water, and sewer taxes and charges, and hire
purchase on loan schemes.
Resource Mobilization: COUP has rescinded its freeze on reassessments of
urban property values for tax purposes, and a number of towns, including
all proposed project towns, have introduced revised property value
assessments. Project towns have extended octroi reforms incorporated in
Kanpur and have minimized exceptions from octroi.
Rent Control: COUP has amended the rent control act to extend the
".control free"l period for new properties from 10 to 20 years.
Institutions: COUP has (i) expanded a state-level urban cell established
under KUDP in HUDD into an investment planning and monitoring cell (IPMC)
to strengthen sector management and to carry out appraisal, supervision
and evaluation of projects proposed by local authorities, and (ii) has
created a cell in the Directorate of Local Bodies (DLB) to manage an
expanded low cost sanitation program.
Legislation: COUP has ,i) amended the Slum Areas (Improvement and
Clearance Act of 1962 to streamline the process of land acquisition
(this will aid in cost recovery in slum upgrading), and (ii) amended the
Mahapalika Adhiniyam (municipal corporation act) and the UP
Municipalities Act of 1916 to permit urban, commercial properties to be
taxed at higher rates than residential properties, and improve the proce-
dures for reassessing urban properties.
Transportation Study: COUP has prepared a draft study in Kanpur to
assess options of introducing private bus services.

C. The Bank's Sector Role and Assistance Strategy in India
1.17    To date, the Bank has committed a total of US$1,395.6 million in
credits and US$89.1 million in loans, net of cancellations, to support 21
projects in the urban and water supply sector in India. Nine projects have
been completed (Calcutta Urban I and II, Calcutta Transport, Bombay Water
Supply and Sewerage I, Bombay Urban Transport, Madras Urban I, Uttar Pradesh
Water Supply and Sewerage, Maharashtra Water Supply and Sewerage, and Punjab
Water Supply and Sewerage), while 12 projects are under implementation
(Calcutta Urban III, Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage II and III, Bombay
Urban, Madras Urban II, Kanpur Urban, Rajasthan Water Supply and Sewerage,
Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage, Madhya Pradesh Urban, Tamil Nadu Water
Supply and Sanitation, Kerala Water Supply and Sanitation, and Gujarat
Urban).
1.18    Physical investments are being implemented satisfactorily under these
projects. Intended improvements in operations and maintenance are being
achieved in some cases but are generally lagging. Progress is also being
made in achieving the cost recovery and resource mobilization objectives of
these projects 1/, particularly in establishing more appropriate water
tariffs, bus fares, plot prices and interest rates, but less so in raising
property tax revenues. Progress is slower in improving sector management, as
evidenced by the slow dissemination of sector-wide policy measures which have
been introduced and tested under specific Bank-supported projects. The
statewide UP Water Supply and Sewerage Project (UPWSSP) (Cr. 585-IN) was
completed in 1983 2/.  Its institutional and financial objectives were not
fully achieved, largely due to (a) a relatively centralized approach with
insufficient involvement of local governments and communities, and (b) a lack
of detailed action plans mapping out how the objectives were to be achieved.
The objectives themselves were ambitious, in retrospect, and could not have
been achieved in the time span of a single project. The Kanpur Urban
Development Project (KUDP), approved by the Board on October 27, 1981
(CR.1185-IN), focuses on the introduction of institutional and financial
improvements in only one town and has been more successful, within its more
limited objectives.  Most major works were completed by the original closing
date of June 30, 1986. A one year extension was granted to complete the
provision of building and sewer connection loans to beneficiaries and to
complete the slum upgrading program, which has been delayed by land acquisi-
tion problems.
1.19    The Bank's lending program in the urban sector will continue to
include specific investment projects to introduce improved resource utiliza-
tion and cost recovery, particularly in states where no or little Bank assis-
tance has been provided previously. However, there will be a shift towards

-7-
sector lending operations which provide more support to broader resource
mobilization and sector management improvements, starting with states where
the Bank has substantial prior sector experience. The proposed project sets
the stage for such an opcration since, at the state level, some important
sector policy changes have been instituted. In addition, about 502 of the
state's Plan investments in the sector has been appraised, in partnership
with the State Government (see paras 2.03 to 2.06). The project, therefore,
has many elements of a sector lending operation, albeit in the selected
towns. At the same time, there will continue to be a movement towards
increased support to, and through, central level intermediaries to help
ensure that policy initiatives and new methodologies are disseminated more
rapidly among states and that all states adopt a reasonably consistent urban
policy framework.
1.20    The Bank's sector assistance strategy has evolved from an initial
phase of exploration and demonstration of alternative sector approaches,
relying mainly on specific investment projects, to the current phase of more
concerted and better focused efforts to assist the respective governments in
formulating and implementing a consistent set of urban sector policies, with
increasing reliance on broader sector lending operations as vehicles to
support change. The current phase of the Bank's assistance also gives more
emphasis to sector analysis and to the provision of direct staff support in
evaluating sector performance and in disseminating lessons on policy initia-
tives and implementation.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Introduction
2.01    Through the two previous projects in UP, the Bank has helped lay the
basis for improved urban sector policies and is encouraging wider dissemina-
tion of required policy adjustments. After two years of intensive analyses
and discussion, GOUP has now demonstrated its readiness to take appropriate
policy actions and set the stage for a sector lending approach. Furthermore,
at the national level the project will assist in the development of a
national level sector intermediary which would address required sector policy
improvements on a multi-state basis through the GPD.
B. Project Objectives
2.02    The overriding objective of the project would be to support the
policy adjustments and the institutional strengthening initiated by GOUP and
GOI/GPD, and to reduce the serious deficits in urban shelter, infrastructure,
and services. To that end, GOUP's specific objectives would be to improve:
sector finances by improving cost recovery and resource utilization and
mobilization; sector management by strengthening sector organizations; and
infrastructure and services by extending and improving, for example, water
supply, sanitation, drainage, solid waste collection, maintenance management,
and traffic management for the urban population, especially the urban poor.
GPD's specific objectives would be to address sector policy improvements by:



-8-
the introduction of program management systems; the development of river
pollution control models; and the preparation of strategic plans for reduc-
tion and control of pollution in the Ganga River.
C. Project Concept
2.03 The project comprises two distinct programs of investments: (a) (i)
about 50Z of UP's Seventh Plan and partial Eighth Plan investments in urban
development and water supply in 11 cities and one new urban area, including
technical assistance and training; (ii) low cost sanitation in an additional
18 towns; and (b) phase 1 investments by the GPD in three states (Bihar, UP,
and West Bengal) under its Seventh Plan, mainly for technical assistance,
training, and urgent rehabilitation works, pending the formulation of a phase
2 action plan to reduce the level of pollution of the Ganga River (see Annex
2 for phase 1 description). As the project provides for rehabilitation o5,
and additions to, existing water works and schemes, there will be no adverse
effect on the flow of waters. Instead, the project will abate pollution and
improve the quality of the flows. In view of this, no notification to down-
stream riparian is required pursuant to OMS 2.32.
2.04    Drawing on its urban sector review, COUP identified a number of urban
areas (see Annex 3) which, based on size, growth rates, urban infrastructure
deficits, economic potential, rnd institutional capacity, could benefit from
an enhanced program of investments. They have been classified into four
principal categories which reflect their size and their particular investment
needs:
Group A:   Kanpur, Agra, Varanasi, Allahabad, and Lucknow - KAVAL towns -
the largest towns with populations ranging from 600,000 to
2,000,000;
Group B:   Bareilly, Moradabad, Gorakhpur, Aligarh, Saharanpur, and
Chaziabad - the group of to-wns next in economic importance in
the state, with populations ranging from 300,000 to 600,000;
Group C:   Shaktinagar - a "new" urban area located near the Singrauli
coalfields and power stations; and
Group D:   Up to 18 towns for which (UNDP/TAG) feasibility studies on low
cost sanitation have been carried out.
2.05    While the selection of the Groups A and B towns has been made on the
above criteria, their inclusion in the project would be contingent upon
continued successful implementation of the policy adjustments referred to in
paragraph 1.16. Standby towns have been identified as well which have also
implemented the policy adjustments but whose project implementation will only
commence after a decision on their inclusion.   Dehradun and Jhansi (Group B)
have been selected as standby, since they are the next two towns in order of
importance in the state. Nainital has been selected as a standby town under
Group C due to the special problem of extreme pollution of its main water
source. Assurances were given during negotiations that if any of the
original 11 towns do not meet agreed interim financial performance targets,



-9-
or lag unduly in implementing their respective investment programs, GOUP/IPMC
will, in consultation with the Bank and IDA, reduce the proposed capital
allocation to such towns and make the funds available to a better performing
town, and/or induct one or more standby towns into the project.
D. Project Description
2.06    The UP program would include the following components:  Z.ctor
Management, Technical Assistance, and Training; Sites and Servicesi Slum
Upgrading; Area Development; Water Supply; Sewerage and Sewage Treatment;
Drainage; Low Cost Sanitation; Solid Waste Management; Maintenance Manage-
ment; and Traffic Engineering and Management. Within a funds allocation
based on per capita criteria, Group A and B towns were given the latitude to
select their perceived investment priorities from the above mentioned
predetermined components. This approach addresses one of the options
proposed in the Project Completion Report (PCR) of UPWSSP, namely, the
desirability of decentralizing the planning function so that awareness and a
sense of ownership and responsibility for the investments might be estab-
lished at an early stage. The Ganga program would provide: (a) consultancy
advisory services and training; (b) pollution monitoring and maintenance
equipment; and (c) priority pollution control works. Table 2.1 shows the
selection of investments by each town based on the funds allocations made by
aOUP, anu investments by GPD. The Bank appraised all proposed investments in
water supply and sewerage, and a representative sample in the remaining
components. The following criteria were used: (i) design standards which
were affordable to the target group; (ii) least cost solution (e.g. in water
supply and sewerage); (iii) emphasis on rehabilitation and maximization of
existing investments; (iv) operation and maintenance; and (v) technical
assistance and training.
2.07    In addition to these investments, there are a number of interrelated
project activities to be undertaken by participating agencies to accelerate
project implementation and to improve the operating efficiency and financial
viability of sector agencies. These actions are discussed throughout this
report, and, because of their importance, they have been grouped into an
Operational Action Plan (OAP) (see Annex 4). Assurances were given at nego-
tiations that the OAP will be reviewed and updated annually by GOUP and GPD,
to be satisfactory to the Bank and IDA.
2.08    Project Components.  Project components are described in the follow-
ing paragraphs. Some components are described in greater detail in Annex 5.
UP Program
2.09  Sector Management, Technical Assistance, and Training:  (Cost: 1/
Rs 7.3 crores:  US$5.6 million).  At the state level in UP, the project would

sion and management costs over an eight year (i.e. Bank-wide Sector
Profile) implementation period.



-10-
support the establishment and operation of: (i) IPMC and a Traffic and
Transportation Appraisal Unit (TTAU) (see para 4.05); and (ii) the costs of
UP Jal Nigam (UPJN) for the preparation of Group A and B towns' water supply
and sewerage components. Consultants would assist the Town and Country
Planning Department (TCPD) to prepare an outline development strategy for new
urban areas. At the local level the project would support the establishment
and operation of Traffic and Engineering and Management Cells (TEMC's) in the
KAVAL towns (in Kanpur such a cell was established under KUDP). IPMC and
local authorities would retain consultant and advisory services for improving
their accounting and management information systems. Technical assistance
would be sought for a number of studies to help improve urban management and
service delivery. GOUP would give major emphasis to training at all levels,
for which programs have been substantially prepared.
2.10    Shelter.  (i) Sites and Services (Cost:  Rs 28.7 crores; US$22.1
million). Eight of the Group A and B towns have included a sites and serv-
ices component in their programs. In all, about 122 hectares would be
developed in eight sites to provide about 9,580 serviced residential plots,
and about 8.3 hectares of commercial and small business plots. All sites are
located close to employment locations, transport facilities, and adjacent to
developed residential areas. Land for all sites has already been acquired;
(ii) Slum Upgrading (Cost: Rs 16.5 crores:  US$12.7 million).  Ten of the
Group A and B towns have selected slum upgrading. About 230 slums covering
about 510 hectaree of land with approximately 350,000 inhabitants would be
upgraded in six cities. Almost all slums to be upgraded are former rural
villages that have been incorporated into the municipatl boundaries. Most
households are the legal owners of their respective properties, so no trans-
fer of land title is contemplated; and
(iii) Area Development (Cost: Rs 3.8 crores: US$2.9 million). Urban shel-
ter can be divided into three main categories: (a) planned communities by
public authorities (e.g., sites and services); (b) communities developed
privately through sub-division; and (c) unauthorized settlements.  In the
latter two categories, while householders generally hold legal title to the
land, minimum standards of services have either followed the creation of the
housing stock, or more likely, there are no services at all. The component
will address six such sites totalling about 57 hectares in two cities housing
approximately 17,500 inhabitants would be improved through provision of
roads, drainage, street lighting and connections to off-site water and
sanitation services. About 60% of the households in these sites are Economi-
cally Weaker Section (EWS) households.

2.11    Water Supply and Sanitation  (i)  Water Supply: (Cost:  Rs 79.4
crores: US$61.0 million). All Group A and B towns have selected investments
in water supply, which is an indication of the deficiencies in this service.
The investments represent the least cost solution to augmenting supplies.
Operational and financial improvements would enhance the efficiency and
delivery of the service;
(ii) Sewerage: (Cost: Rs 19.3 crores: US$14.8 million). As is the case
with water supply, all Group A and B towns have included investments in this
component. Most of the work included in the project would support cleaning
and repair of existing sewers and, in some cases (which are quite extensive)
the construction of new sewers to replace old sewers, now either beyond
repair or with inadequate capacity to meet present and future flows;
(iii) Drainages (Cost: Rs 27.9 Crores: US$21.5 million). Ten Group A
and 8 towns have included investments in drainage, which include the procure-
ment and laying of pipes and the construction of drains. Where the latter
are located in built up areas, the public will be protected from the poten-
tial danger posed by the drains by the construction of parapet walls. In
some places the drains will be covered intermittently to provide protection
without preventing cleaning; and
(iv) Low Cost Sanitation: (Cost: Rs 12.9 crores: US$9.9 million). Eight
Group A and B towns and up to 18 towns in Group D would invest in low cost
sanitation. The sub-projects prepared by the towns are to UNDP/TAG design.
The project places great importance on the proposals for those citizens who
dwell outside the sewered areas. The proposals form part of a program which
extends beyond the project period. Accurate estimates are not available
because these depend on public response. However, Kanpur, for example, aims
at completing 2,500 conversions per annum over the project period, and to
construct 150 community latrines as well. Overall, some 51,700 conversions
from the bucket conservancy system to ventilated improved pit latrines with
poured flush, and about 7,700 new units, are expected to be completed over
the project period.
2.12    funicipal Services  (i) Solid Waste Management (SWM):  (Cost:  Rs
11.8 crores:  US$9.1 million). Ten towns would improve their solid waste
operations. At present) these towns expend an average of 40% of their total
revenues on SWM, but existing primary collection methods involve double or
triple handling of wastes, resulting in low productivity and vehicle utiliza-
tion, with poor service delivery. Estimates of population served vary now
from 35% to 65%.
(ii) Maintenance Management: (Cost: Rs 9.7 crores: US$7.5 million). Nine
towns have included investments in this component which would provide for
studies and the purchase of equipment. An important objective of the project
is to institute lasting improvements in the maintenance of infrastructure and
service delivery systems. While a number of factors, including insufficient
funding, contribute to the maintenance deficiencies, the primary cause is a
management problem which the project will seek to redress through technical
assistance and training; and



-13-
(iii) Traffic Engineering and Management: (Cost: Rs 9.8 crores: US$7.6
million). TEMC's would be responsible for (a) initiating the process of
evolving long-term transport policies in their respective cities, (b) sup-
porting low cost solutions to traffic congestion and means of improving
traffic safety, (c) arranging for the purchase of equipment for traffic
police, and (d) promoting and carrying out road safety programs.
2.13    Ganga Program:  This.program would provide:  (i) Technical
Assistance: (Rs 4.3 crores; US$3.3 million). The project would support
environmental impact studies; sewer condition assessment and identification
of remedial works; program monitoring; river quality monitoring assessment;
assistance in programming and preparation of rehabilitation works not yet
identified; and the preparation of a strategic plan for the long term reduc-
tion of pollution in the Ganga River;
(ii) Training: (Rs 0.8 crores; US$0.6 million). The project would
develop training needs; review institution availability; determine training
institutional arrangements; and provide river modeling technology training;
(iii) Priority Equipment: (Rs 5.4 crores; US$4.2 million). GPD
would arrange to procure: (a) jetting machines, gulley pit emptiers, rodding
and bucket cleaning machines, loaders and related equipment for sewer clean-
ing operations; and (b) automatic monitoring, sampling and analyzing equip-
ment; and
(iv) Priority Pollution Control Works: (Rs 48.5 crores; US$37.3
million). The works to be implemented include: (a) sewage treatment plants
at Allahabad, Haridwar, and Kanpur; and (b) other pollution control works to
be identified.
III. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A. Cost Estimates
3.01    The total project costs, including contingencies, are estimated at
Rs 309.2 crores (US$237.8 million). The foreign exchange component is
Rs 73.4 crores (US$56.4 million), or 241 of project costs. Taxes and duties
are estimated at Rs 15.6 crores (US$12.0 million), or 5Z of project costs.
Summary cost estimates are given in Table 3.1, while more detailed estimates
for each town/component are given in Annex 6.
3.02    Base cost estimates are in September 1986 prices.  Cost estimates for
civil works are based on final designs for a number of major components in
UP's Seventh/Eighth Plan investment proposals and on the costs of similar
works carried out recently in UP, and on preliminary engineering designs for
the GPD component. Estimates for equipment and materials are based on recent
quotations from suppliers. The project provides for sustained support in
sector anagement (US$1,600,000), detailed engineering (US$2,600,000), tech-
nical assistance (US$4,000,000), and training (US$1,400,000).  Average per-
son-month (all inclusive) costs for foreign and locally procured consultant
and advisory services are estimated at US$16,000 and Rs 20,000 (US$1,540)



-14-
respectively. The project provides for about 75 person months of foreign
consultancy for GPD, and for leak detection and repair assistance for GOUP.
3.03    Physical contingencies of 10% have been included for all components
except slum upgrading, drainage, and solid waste civil works, where 15Z has
been used. Design and supervision costs are estimated at 13X. No physical
contingencies or design and supervision costs have been applied to land,
equipment and materials, and technical assistance and training. A 2X manage-
ment fee has been applied to all investments. Price contingencies have been
estimated as follows for both foreign and local costs: 6% for fiscal year
1986/87, 6.8Z for 1987/88-1988/89, 71 for 1989/90-1990/91, and 4X for
1991/92-1993/94.
Status of Preparation
3.04    Final designs and bid documents have been completed or are in
advanced stages of preparation for all investments in Group A, Bo and D
towns. For Group C (Shaktinagar) investments in key sectors would be iden-
tified and created following studies to be carried out in the area. In the
Ganga program, GPD has retained corporate consultancy services (financed by
the Overseas Development Authority (ODA) of UK) to undertake the first phase
of advisory services focusing particularly on (i) river quality modelling,
and (ii) resource recovery and utilization. Physical investments for the
Ganga program have been prepared up to the preliminary design stage.
B. Financing Plan
3.05    The proposed Bank loan of US$20 million and IDA credit of US$130
million would finance about 66% of project costs, net of taxes and duties.
The loan and credit would cover 1001 of the foreign exchange costs and about
521 of local costs. The loan and credit would be made available to COI,
which would pass them on to COUP on its standard terms and conditions as part
of central government assistance to the state, and to GPD as a grant (Credit
only). COUP would make available to the project towns all funds required for
their investments, including the proceeds of the Bank loan and IDA credit,
in a combination of loan and grants. The terms of COUP loans to implementing
agencies conform to current practices as follows: 8.75Z per annum, to be
amortized over 20 years, including a five year moratorium on principal repay-
ments. GOUP will provide funds on a grant basis for the following invest-
ments: (i) low cost sanitation (501 grant); (ii) Minimum Needs Program (MNP)
for slum upgrading (1OOZ grant up to Rs 250/capita or such other threshold to
be set from time to time by GOI); and (iii) community facilities, including
schools, health centers, police stations, post offices and community halls in
the sites and services component (100% grant). CPD will make available
directly to implementing agencies in Bihar, UP and West Bengal all funds
required for rehabilitation works and new construction, intluding the
proceeds of the IDA credit, as grants. The flow of funds is indicated in
Chart 3.2.

3.06    Sector management, technical assistance, and training expenditures
would be absorbed by GOUP except expenditures for technical assistance
incurred by project towns for the preparation of their water supply and
sewerage proposals by UPJN, which would be treated as a loan by COUP to the
water and sewerage authority in each town.
3.07    Total project costs, including contingencies, design, supervision
and management, and taxes (see Table 3.1) are based on the Bank-wide profile
applicable to the sector (i.e., eight year implementation/nine year disburse-
ment). All economic and financial analyses are also based on this profile.
However, GOUP and GPD believe they can implement the project over five years
and four years, respectively, in accordance with the funding arrangements set
out in Annex 7. Under this schedule, the total project cost including con-
tingencies, design, supervision and management, and taxes and duties is
estimated at Rs 283.27 crores (US$217.90 million), or about US$20 million
(8X) less than the costs in Table 3.1. Assurances were given at negotiations
that GOUP and GPD will provide the resources necessary to complete the
project as appraised, or any mutually agreed amendments arising during the
course of implementation.
3.08    As the state of preparation is well advanced, with detailed engineer-
ing designs, and estimates of quantities completed for most components, and
as GOUP and GPD are anxious to sustain the momentum built up by project towns
and also take advantage of the present construction season, the following
retroactive financing would be provided:
(i) from November 1, lJ85: (a) consultant assistance for project
preparation; and
(ii) From August 1, 1986, all other project expenditures.
The total amount of retroactive financing would not exceed US$15 million, or
10% of the loan and credit.

IV. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. UP State Level Agencies
4.01    GOUP's Housing and Urban Development Department (HUDD) has respon-
sibility for overseeing project implementing agencies, including local
governments, development authorities, and town water and sewerage agencies.
Policy guidance and coordination of other state and local agencies rests with
a Project Coordination and Monitoring Committee (PCMC) at the state level
under the chairmanship of the Secretary, HUDD. At each city level, a Local
Coordination and Monitoring Committee (LCMC) was formed to coordinate and
monitor project activities. LCMC would report to PCMC. The organizat2cn and
interrelationship of the state and local level agencies is outlined in
Chart 4.1.
4.02    Investment Planning and Monitoring Cell (IPMC).  The actual formula-
tion, monitoring of project implementation, authorization of disbursements
to project agencies, and evaluation of the investment program would be the
responsibility of IPMC, a separate unit within HUDD. IPMC evolved out of the
urban strategy cell created under KUDP to develop a strategy for statewide
urban development and strengthen urban management and finance. It prepared
an Urban Sector Review (Item No. 1 of Annex 13), a critical document on the
status of urban deielopment, management, and finance in the state, from which
the present project was formulated. IPMC participated with the Bank in the
pre-appraisal and appraisal of the project, demonstrating an independence and
professionalism which would make it suitable for assuming some supervisory
responsibility during implementation. The appraisal mission agreed with IPMC
on appropriate technical, financial, and economic guidelines and criteria tc
be followed. During implementation, IPMC would be responsible for reviews
of the towns' investments programs, and the deletion, substitution, inclusion
of new investments and standby towns (see para 2.05), in consultation with
the Bank and IDA. IPMC's influence has already begun to extend beyond the
project towns into the remaining urban areas of the state. The present
professional staff strength is 10, with disciplines in town planning, tran-
sport planning, civil and mechanical engineering, sanitary engineering,
economics/financial analysis, and law. They are all senior officials well
experienced in their fields who were associated with KUDP during preparation
and implementation. As part of the OAP, GOUP would ensure that IPMC has the
resources necestary to carry out a greater role in the supervision of the
project.
4.03    Throughout project preparation, the State Government through HUDD
and IPMC has supported the project by implementing critical policy adjust-
ments, resolving problems, and adopting new ideas.

4.04    Low Cost Sanitation Cell.  GOUP has also created a low cost sanita-
tion cell in the Directorate of Local Bodies (DLB) to supervise the low cost
sanitation program in the 18 Group D towns. Assurances were given during
negotiations that GOUP will employ adequate staff in the cell with the
appropriate disciplines throughout the project period to carry out this
program.
4.05    Traffic and Transportation Appraisal Unit (TTAU).  GOUP proposes to
create a TTAU within its Town and Country Planning Department (TCPD) to
assist in evolving appropriate traffic and transport policies at the city
level, and to provide technical support at the state level towards resolving
problems of coordination among various departments and agencies (e.g., elec-
tricity board, public works department, telecommunications department). It
will also frame guidelines for transport sector studies, and institutional
arrangements, and carry out appraisals not only in the KAVAL towns where
traffic engineering and management cells (TEMC's) are to be set up before
July 1, 1987, but also in the 16 other large urban areas in the state where
development authorities have been created and prospective development plans
are being drawn up by TCPD. As part of the OAP, GOUP would be required to
staff the TTAU adequately through the project period.
4.06    Special Area Development Authority (SADA).  The Group C town,
Shaktinagar, is the Singrauli area of Mirsapur district of UP where major
development activities in power generation and coal mining are taking place.
The urban population of the Shaktinagar area is expected to increase from the
present 20% of the total urban population of Mirzapur district to about 50Z
by the year 2001. As there has been little planned development to date in
the area, resulting amongst other things in increased environmental problems,
COUP has created SADA there. A planning unit under a chief regional planner
would be set up in SADA during the project period to assist in developing a
strategic plan, followed by an investment plan, for the area. The TCPD would
assist with some studies. The lessons learned would be applied to other
areas of the state where because of particular considerations, similar SADA's
might also be established.
4.07    UP Jal Nigam (UPJN).  UPJN, a State Government autonomous corpora-
tion, was created in June 1975 out of the Local Self Government Engineering
Department, previously known as the Public Health Engineering Department.
4.08    UPJN has the legal responsibility for planning, designing, and con-
structing investment projects in the water supply and sanitation sector, on
behalf of urban and rural agencies. One of its first tasks was to implement
the UPWSSP (see para 1.18). While UPJN will continue to play a major role in
the rural areas, owing to the lack of technical expertise and administrative
arrangements, its role in urban areas needs to be reoriented. The PCR listed
a number of options which to a large extent were adopted for the sector under
this project (e.g., "bottom-up" approach to the planning of investments to
obtain, inter alia, local body commitment, with funding to pass through the



-21-
local agency). In all eleven project towns the local water authority
prepared its respective components with the assistance of the UPJN.
4.09    A high level GOUP committee is reviewing the role of a number of
institutions in the state, including that of UPJN and Jal Sansthans (JS's).
Assurances were given at negotiations that GOUP will keep the Bank and IDA
informed of any changes contemplated/made in the role of any project
implementing agency which will materially affect the project.
B. UP Local Level Agencies
4.10    At the local level, LCMC's have overall responsibility for coordina-
tion of project execution. The agencies directly involved in implementing
the project at this level are the Development Authorities (DAs), the Nagar
Mahapalikas (NM's) or municipal corporations, in Kanpur, Agra, Varanasi,
Allahabad, Lucknow, Bareilly, and Gorakhpur, Nagar Pahalikas (NP's), or
municipal boards, in Moradabad, Aligarh, and Saharanpur, City Board (CB), in
Ghaziabad, and the Jal Sansthans (JS's), or city water and sewerage
authorities in Kanpur, Agra, Varanasi, Allahabad, and Lucknow. Water supply
and sanitation in the remaining towns is the responsibility of NM's or NP's
(see Table 4.2). Ownership of the investment created, and responsibility for
operation, maintenance, and servicing the debt thereon (where applicable)
would likewise devolve on the local agencies in Groups A-D listed in Table
4.2, with the following exceptions:
ii) Water supply and sewerage: UPJN would assist in execution: owner-
ship would remain with Jal Sansthans (JS), Nagar Mahapalikas (NM),
Nagar Palikas (NP), and City Board (Ghaziabad);
(ii) Low cost sanitation: Lucknow - JS would implement this component on
behalf of NM. The Directorate of Local Bodies (DLB) would assist
municipal boards in implementation of the Group D Component; and
(iii) Traffic Engineering and Management: Agra - DA would implement this
component.
4.11    Under the provisions of the UP Planning and Development Act of 1973,
DA's are set up in selected cities to coordinate and promote the development
of the area.  DA's have the power to acquire, hold, manage, and dispose of
land and other property, and carry out construction, engineering, and other
operations. There are at present 21 development authorities in the state.
Under tht project, DA's would be responsible for implementing the sites and
services and area development components.
4.12    The main weaknesses of DA's are administrative and financial manage-
ment. DA's tend to incur losses on sales, owing to lengthy periods in
acquiring land, for which additionaX amounts are often paid following

court rulings. They also have a low or negative return on their rental
properties. The financial position is supported temporarily by the large
amount of refundable deposits taken for the construction of shelter. These
problems could be solved with better management and an accrual accounting
system rather than the single entry cash system. Under KUDP, consultants
were employed to design and implement an appropriate accrual accounting
system for the Kanpur Development Authority (KDA) including improvements in
organization and methods, collection systems, project cost accounting and
management, and internal controls. The systems have been duly implemented,
resulting in improved management and finances of KDA, enabling it to complete
nearly 15,000 sites and services units in four years at a cost which is
affordable to the original tirget group. The ir'provements introduced into
KDA are being replicated in the DA's of the other project towns (see OAP -
Annex 4, Section 4).
4.13    Urban Local Bodies.   There are some 660 urban local bodies in the
state, including eight corporations, 167 municipal bodies, 44 notified areas,
and 441 town area communities. Municipal corporations are governed by the
Uttar Pradesh Nagar Mahapalika Adhiniyam of 1959, municipal boards by the UP
Municipalities Act of 1916* and town areas by the Town Areas Act of 1920.
4.14    A local body is responsible for solid waste management, sanitation,
street lighting, traffic engineering, city roads, and to some extent, mater-
nity and child health, and education. Its duties are mainly operation and
maintenance of facilities, but it also undertakes some new works. Under the
project, NM's and NP's will carry out the following capital works: slum
upgrading, sanitation, drainage, solid waste and maintenance (e.g., con-
struction of garages and workshops), and traffic engineering and management.
The functions of local bodies have sometimes been eroded: (i) by creation of
DA's; and (ii) by separating water supply and sewerage operations into Jal
Sansthans (see para 4.17). Elections have not been held for a number of
years, and all local bodies in the state are now functioning under
administrators appointed by the State Government.
4.15    Local bodies generally have severe financial constraints which
inhibit the effective operation and maintenance of assets and service
delivery. Their administration is characterized by low productivity and over
staffing. Revenues are generally inelastic except for octroi which, being
based on the present value of goods, rises with inflation and accounts for
between 45-60X of recurrent revenue generation. There is resistance to
paying for services rendered (e.g., water and sewerage), while rent control
on properties precludes periodic revaluations to take account of inflation.
Under KUDP, corsultant assistance was retained by Karpur Nagar Mahapalika
(KNM) to (i) carry out a comprehensive institutional strengthening program,
(ii) introduce an appropriate accounting system, (iii) carry out a resource
mobilization study to improve the resource base by (a) improving internal
efficiency, (b) improving the tax assessment and collection machinery, and
(c) tapping additional revenue resources, and (iv) strengthen maintenance



-24-
management. KNM, since implementing the recommendations of the above
studies, has achieved impressive results in some areas, notably improvements
in octroi collection, and in accounting and financial management. Many of
the improvements introduced into KNM have already been replicated in the NM's
and NP's of the remaining project towns. The introduction of the accounting
systems, expected to be operational from April 1, 1987, has commenced. As
suggested in paras 1.06 and 1.07, improvements in property tax valuation
assessment and billing and collection have come more slowly than other
resource mobilization measures. Paragraph 1.16 lists several actions that
have been taken to improve revenues.
4.16    Traffic Engineering and Management Cells (TEMC's).  In the KAVAL
towns, TEMC's would operate on a continuing basis within NM's to (i) initiate
the process of evolving long term transport policies in the respective cities
in consultation with TTAU (see para 4.05), and (ii) support low-cost traffic
management schemes and safety measures. The cells would be headed by a
qualified traffic and transportation planner, and the favorable experience
gained by TEMC, Kanpur, during the past four years would be disseminated to
the remaining KAVAL towns. Assurances were given at negotiations that TEMC's
will be established in Agra, Varanasi, Allahabad, and Lucknow, similar to the
cell in Kanpur, and that they will be adequately staffed before proceeding
with physical components.
4.17    Jal Sansthans (JS).  When the State Government created the UPJN in
1975 under the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam Act of 1975, it also created under the
same act a number of Jal Sansthans to be autonomous and financially viable
water supply and sewerage undertakings, by separating the water supply and
sewerage functions from the local body. There are now eight JS's: three
regional--Garhwal, Kumaon and Bundelkhand--and 5 city specific - Kanpur,
Agra, Varanasi, Allahabad, and Lucknow. The functions and powers of JS's are
to promote and execute schemes in water supply and sanitation and operate
such schemes efficiently. They have the power to borrow, introduce or amend
tariffs (subject to approval of UPJN), and collect all due charges and taxes
on their operations.   In practice, JS's do not possess planning and design
capability, which has been carried out by the UPJN instead. JS's and other
local bodies responsible for the distribution and sale of water are required
to meet their operation, maintenance, and debt service costs from their own
revenue sources. The actual state of affairs is that in order to balance
expenditures and receipts, JS's and local bodies underperform on maintenance
and do not promptly pay their electricity bills or debt service to UPJN.
Organizationally, they require more trained staff to remedy deficiencies in
implementing metering and meter repair programs, billing, and collection.
4.18    While physical performance under UPWSSP was good, financial perfor-
mance of JS's was poor. None of the JS's met the covenanted rates of return
during the implementation period of the project. Under KUDP, a more limited
financial objective was set for the Kanpur Jal Sansthan (KJS), which, until
recently, it also had experienced difficulty in meeting. In October 1985,



-25-
KJS raised its tariffs, taxes, and charges by an average of about 65%. From
April 1, 1987, water and sewer taxes (which are a percentage of the annual
values of properties) will increase further through the introduction of
revised assessments of urban properties. The effect of the above measures
will now enable KJS to meet its financial covenant.
C. Central Ganga Authority (CGA)
4.19    Overall responsibility for the cleanup of the Ganga River rests with
the CGA, which is chaired by the Prime Minister. CGA has drawn up a Ganga
Action Plan (GAP) which is coordinated through the Ganga SteAring
Committee 1/, while the Ganga Project Directorate (GPD) is responsible for
the detailed implementation of GAP. GPD is soundly managed. It is headed up
by a senior civil servant from the Indian Administrutive Service (IAS) and
staffed with a small core of spe:ialists in financial management, sanitary
engineering, and pollution control. GPD would rely heavily on consultants
for corporate consulting advisory services (see para 3.04), environmental
impact studies, ,ewer condition assessment, program monitoring, including
review of tender documents and the technical assessment of schemes, river
quality monitoring, and the preparation of rehabilitation works not yet
identified. The project provides financing for the above services.
4.20    GPD would delegate responsibility for executing priority rehabilita-
tion works under the project to the following implementing agencies:
Bihar:          Bihar State Water and Sewerage Board (BISWAS)
Uttar Pradesh:  UP Jal Nigam (UPJN)
West Bengal:    Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA)
and Public Health Engineering Directorate (PHED).
The States may also designate other agencies to assist in implementing this
component.   IPMC would be responsible in UP and Bihar for procurement of
sewer cleaning equipment, and its distribution to the respective JS's, NM's
and BISWAS. Ownership of the investments would generally rest with the
municipal corporation/board in whose locality the asset is created. GPD
investments can be divided into three categories: (i) rehabilitation of
existing assets, (ii) expansion of existing assets, and (iii) new assets.
1/ Chaired by the Secretary, Department of Environment, and members consist-
ing of the Chief Secretaries of Bihar, UP, and West Bengal, Secretaries
of Ministry of Urban Development, Department of Non-Conventional Energy
Sources, Joint Secretaries of Fertilizer Division Ministry of Agricul-
ture, Ministry of Finance, Industrial Development concerned with licens-
ing of industrial units, Chairman of the Central Board for Prevention and
Control of Water Pollution, and a representative from the Ministry of
Health.



-26-
Items (i) and (ii) would remain with the local authority for ownership,
operation, and maintenance. For item (iii) GPD would provide the funds
needed for operation and maintenance during the 7th Five-Year Plan
(1985-1990). After 1990, in the event GPD is dismantled, the ownership and
operation and maintenance of the new facilities would be vested in the
respective State Governments. In order to address the issue of long term
irstitutional and financial arrangements for effective operation and main-
tenance of new facilities, GPD has set up an expert committee. It is due to
report shortly. However, COUP has already given a commitment to finance
oneration and maintenance of the new facilities in UP after the 7th Plan
petriod.
D. Implementation Schedule
4.21    IPMC and GPD would be responsible for overall coordination and
management of the project. As up to 10 components may be under implementa-
tion at any one time in over 10 towns, no summary project implementation
schedule is presented. Instead, the schedule of implementation of each
component is given in the Summary Project Reports for each town (Annex 13,
Item 7).
E. Procurement
4.22    Table 4.3 provides a breakdown of project costs, showing also the
principal types of procurement. All contracts would be awarded in accordance
with Bank procurement guidelines. During appraisal, format draft procurement
documents were agreed with IPMC and GPD to be used by implementing agencies
for all components in all project towns.
4.23    Out of a total estimated value of contracts for civil works of
US$165.3 million, about US$58.0 million would be awarded under international
competitive bidding (ICB). This comprises about six contracts to be awarded
on a turnkey basis to prequalified contractors for (a) design, construction,
and commissioning of water treatment plants at Lucknow and Agra, and augmen-
tation of river water supplies at Varanasi, and (b) sewage treatment plants
at Allahabad, Haridwar, and Kanpur. The turnkey option was selected by both
COUP and CPD to take maximum advantage of available technology options, and
to ensure that least cost treatment process designs are adopted. For these
turnkey contracts, margins of preference for domestic manufacturers and
contractors would be agreed between the Bank/IDA and GOUP/GPD. An amount of
about US$107.3 million would be spent on the remaining civil works, to be
procured under local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures. These contracts
would not attract foreign bidders, since they are widely dispersed over area
and time. Under the sites and services and area development components,
however, the works for each site would be let on a "slice and package" basis
to pre-qualified contractors advertised on an all-India basis. The size of
each contract would vary from about Rs 65 lakhs (US$0.5 million) to Rs 585
lakhs (US$4.5 million).

4.24    Contracts for equipment and materials to be procured under the
project total US$28.9 million. Of rhis amount, US$18.8 million would be
procured under ICB based on a contract package threshold of US$100,000 equiv-
alent. The equipment and materials would be grouped into packages, and
further aggregated by towns in order to achieve lower unit costs. The fol-
lowing items would be covered: aerial tower wagons, carrier vehicles and
containers, cast iron/ductile iron pipes and fittings, compaction collection
vehicles and bins, cranes, gully pit emptiers, hydraulic towers, jeeps, sewer
cleaning and jetting machines, static road rollers, tipper trucks (4/7 mt),
water meters, and vibratory road rollers (1-4 tons). IPMC would, on behalf
of towns, tender for such equipment each year and recommend to the respective
towns the lowest evaluated bidder (i.e., procurement through nominated
suppliers). Towns and suppliers would settle directly with each other.
Qualifying domestic manufacturers would receive a preference in bid evalua-
tion of 15% or the import duty, whichever is the lower. Other equipment and
materials totalling US$10.1 million, which, even after grouping, would not
exceed contract package thresholds of US$100,000 equivalent, would be
procured through contracts/purchase orders advertised locally, except for
minor items of equipment such as aluminum tower ladders, fogging machine and
trailer, handcarts, mobile generators, minor tools, primary collection equip-
ment, pumps (20 hp), silt/water wagons, test equipment and tractor attach-
ments, totalling US$1.2 million, which would be purchased on the basis of at
least three quotations.
4.25    Existing local competitive bidding procedures have been reviewed for
Uttar Pradesh. (Those for West Bengal (GPD component) have been reviewed and
refined over the course of three urban development projects financed by the
Bank since 1973). The review showed that the procedures generally ensure
adequate competition, open procedures, fair and equitable treatment of all
bidders, and encourage economy and efficiency. However, potential weaknesses
were noted in: (a) inexplicit bid evaluation criteria, (b) award to the
lowest responsive evaluated bidder, and (c) settlement of disputes by local
courts or local arbitration procedures. Assurances were given during nego-
tiations that Bank and IDA procurement guidelines will be complied with.  The
Bank and IDA would also ensure during project execution that the anomalies
noted above are given due attention.
4.26    Sector management, technical assistance and training costs under the
project total US$9.0 million. Of this amount, US$1.5 million is for sector
management in UP, US$2.5 million for engineering services provided by UPJN
for the design of the water and sewerage (UP and GPD) components, US$1.4
million for training, and US$3.6 million for technical assistance. Bank
guidelines for the use of consultants would be complied with for the follow-
ing: (i) in the UP component, in leakage and waste control in all KAVAL
towns, in utility mapping and inventory in all project towns, in a tariff
study for water supply and sewerage, in assistance to implement accounting
and management information systems, in maintenance studies, in audits (see
para 4.34), and in other technical assistance agreed by the Bank/IDA and GOUP



-29-
that would be needed to achieve project objectives; and (ii) in GPD com-
ponent, in corporate consulting advisory services, in environmental impact
studies, in sewer condition assessment, in program consultants services, in
river quality monitoring and documentation, and in assistance to GPD in
programming and preparation of rehabilitation works not yet identified.
4.27    Contract Review.  All bidding packages for civil works estimated to
cost US$500,000 equivalent or more, and all bidding packages for equipment
and materials estimated to cost US$200,000 equivalent or more, would be
subject to the Bank's and IDA's prior review of procurement documentation,
resulting in coverage of 49% of the total estimated value of works contracts,
and about 30% of goods and materials contracts. This will involve a review
of about 41 contracts (22 civil works, 19 equipment and materials). The
balance of contracts would be subject to random post review by the Bank and
IDA after contract award. All contracts would be subject to IPMC and GPD
review. The number and value of contracts to be reviewed are less than the
suggested guidelines. As described in paragraph 4.24, contracts have, to the
extent possible, been aggregated by towns to produce larger contracts. The
geographical spread of the project and varied nature of works generally
preclude further aggregation of works contracts. The relativeiy Low number
and value of contracts to be reviewed under the project is therefore con-
sidered acceptable.
F. Disbursement
4.28    The proceeds of the loan and credit would be disbursed against:
(a) 100% foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment and
materials, and 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally
manufactured equipment and materials procured through ICB;
(b) 65% of expenditures for equipment and materials procured through LCB
or through quotations;
(c) 85% of expenditures on contracts for civil works, including turnkey
contracts, awarded under ICB;
(4) 65% of expenditures on civil works contracts awarded under LCB;
(e) 85X of expenditures on home improvement loans; and
(f) 100% of expenditures for sector management, technical assistance and
training and related equipment.
Disbursements for (e) above, for civil works and equipment and materials
expenditures against contracts not exceeding Rs 26 lakhs (US$200,000), and
sector management and training expenditures, would be made against statements
of expenditures (SOE's), the documents for which would not be submitted to



-30-
the Bank/IDA but retained and made available for inspection during project
supervision missions, and subject to independent audits (see para 4.34).
4.29    To expedite disbursements, a Special Account with an authorized
allocation of US$5.6 million (representing about four months of estimated
IDA-financed expenditures), would be established in the Reserve Bank of
India, on terms at-d conditions satisfactory to IDA. The Special Account
would be used to finance all eligible expenditures, and would be replenished
from time-to-time on receipt and approval of withdrawal applications, sup-
ported by the required documentation.
4.30    As indicated in paragraph 3.07 above, GOUP and GPD expect to imple-
ment the project over five years and four years, respectively. As the
Bank-wide profile for the urban and water supply sectors indicates a nine
year disbursement period, a schedule for disbursement of the Bank loan and
IDA credit has been prepared accordingly, and is shown in Table 4.4.
C. Accounts and Audit
4.31    During preparation of KUDP, accrual accounting and associated manage-
ment information systems were designed and implemented for Kanpur Development
Authority (KDA), while for Kanpur Nagar Mahapalika (KNM) a partial accrual
accounting system and associated management information system was also
designed and implemented. The accrual accounting and management information
systems for Kanpur Jal Sansthan (KJS) were designed and implemented under
UPWSSP.
4.32    All remaining project towns have commenced introduction of the
systems designed under KUDP, and they are expected to be fully operational
commencing April 1, 1987. In addition, DLB on behalf of Group D towns, UPJN,
Bihar State Water and Sewerage Board (BISWAS), Calcutta Metropolitan Develop-
ment Authority (CMDA), Public Health Engineering Directorate (PHED, West
Bengal), and GPD would maintain separate project accounts to record the
progress of implementation of the components for which they are responsible.
4.33    Compliance with audit covenants under UPWSSP and KUDP has been poor.
In the years that UPWSSP was under implementation, no audit report was sub-
mitted. Audit reports for KUDP were delayed initially but are now up to
date. The audit reports received to date have been the standard Accountant
General's (AG) statutory audits. Although IDA had requested it, no separate
assessment was made by the auditor of record of the material deficiencies or
weaknesses in the accounting and internal controls of KDA, KNM, and KJS.

4.34    With the introduction of improved accounting systems in the remaining
project towns, GOUP recognizes there is a need for a critical assessment of
the financial operations of the principal implementing agencies. Subject to
the approval of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), COUP has agreed,
therefore, that for at least the first three years of the project commencing
April 1, 1987, at least 11 principal implementing agencies in the Group A and
B towns with project investments exceeding Rs 10 crores, will employ inde-
pendent commercial auditors selected in consultation with the CAG or AG. The
costs of such services would be treated as technical assistance and financed
from the proceeds of the credit. The auditors will be required to provide,
along with their audit report, a separate management letter advising the
agencies of any deficiencies or weaknesses in the accounting and management
information systems and internal controls, and recommendations for improve-
ments. The project accounts of UPJN, BISWAS, CMDA, and PHED, will also be
audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and IDA. In
addition, when reimbursements are requested through SOE's, independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank and IDA will annually certify that the under-
lying data fully support these requests. The Bank and IDA will require that
these certificates also be submitted within nine months of the end of each
fiscal year. During negotiations assurances were given that audit reports
and related financial statements will be submitted to the Bank and IDA within
nine months of the end of each fiscal year. Assurances were also given at
negotiations that COUP and GPD will follow these audit practices.
H. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.35    IPMC and GPD will be responsible for monitoring the physical and
financial progress of the project. For reporting purposes, IPMC will ensure
that project towns will use the reporting formats developed and refined under
KUDP. It will collate the monthly reports received from project towns and
submit consolidated quarterly reports to the Bank and IDA. GPD's program
monitoring consultants will develop reporting formats similar to IPMC's for
reporting on this component.
4.36    IPMC, and GPD where appropriate, will also focus on fiscal and
socio-economic performance in terms of key indicators, such as actual and
estimated operation and maintenance costs; actual and estimated service
delivery norms; actual and estimated revenue collection and direct cost
recovery; actual and estimated revenue expenditures. Assurances were given
during negotiations that GOUP and GPD will: (i) arrange to send the Bank and
IDA regular reports of physical and finarcial progress of the project perfor-
mance in terms of key indicators; and (ii) consult with the Bank and IDA on
any major changes they or project towns propose to make to their respective
investment programs.



-33-
I. Supervision
4.37    The project will require an average of about 20 person weeks per year
of Bank and IDA supervision, totalling about 180 person weeks over the
estimated nine year project period. The regional average for urban projects
supervision is about 15 person weeks. The higher supervision requirements
for this project are due to the number of components and the geographical
spread of the investments. IPMC and GPD will assume an increasing burden of
supervision in all project towns as the project progresses, with Bank and IDA
staff inputs gradually being reduced. Ultimately, it is envisaged that staff
inputs would concentrate on IPMC and GPD, which will play the key inter-
mediary roles.
V. PRICING, AFFORDABILITY, COST RECOVERY, AND RESOURCE MOBILIZATION
A. Pricing, Affordability, and Cost Recovery
5.01    About 45% of total project costs would be recovered from
beneficiaries (10% through payments in the sites and services and area
development components, and 351 through user charges in the water and sanita-
tion components). The interest rates for shelter, home improvement, sewer
connection, and low cost sanitation loans would be higher than in existing
programs and positive in real terms. The average annual rate of inflation
over the project period is expected to range from 4% to 7Z.
5.02    Sites and Services.  Full cost recovery would be achieved in this
component. About 95% of the total cost would be directly chargeable to
beneficiaries (land, site preparation, on-site infrastructure, off-site
infrastructure, on-plot development, and shelter loans). Land would be
costed at market prices (up to Rs 100 per square meter compared to Rs 10 per
square meter typical in past projects). Overheads would be included in the
costs to be recovered. Interest at not less than 12Z per annum would be
charged, which is expected to be positive in real terms since the annual
inflation rate during the project period is expected not to exceed 7%. The
rate is well above the 4% to 6X now charged in similar projects. Cost
recovery at this level would be made affordable through appropriate designs
and a system of differential land pricing, with upper income and business
plot beneficiaries paying higher than average costs. Thus, about 78X of
plots would be affordable to economically weaker section (EWS) and lower
income group (LIC) households with incomes up to Rs 700 per month (about the
25th percentile) and between Rs 701 to Rs 1,500 per month, respectively. The
terms of plot charges and loans would include:
(i) for residential plots and shelter loans for EWS households, an
average 15% downpayment on the price of the plot, with the balance of
the plot price and loan amount (if any) to be repaid at not less than



-34-
121 p.a. interest over 20 years; and (ii) LIG and middle income
groups (MIG), a 25% downpayment with the balance to be paid at not
less than 12% p.a. over 6-10 years, and (iii) higher income groups
(HIG) and industrial plots, a 25% downpayment with the balance to
be paid at not less than 12X p.a. over 6 years. Assurances were
given at negotiations that the terms and conditions of lease and hire
purchase agreements in sites and services, will be satisfactory to
the Bank and IDA and an interest rate of not less than 12% will be
charged to beneficiaries.
5.03    The remaining cost of community facilities (51) would not be
recovered directly, but some of the costs of off-site infrastructure would be
recovered through user charges.
5.04    Slum Upgrading.  There would be no direct cost-recovery from
beneficiaries for slum upgrading except in the ahatas of Kanpur (see Annex 5,
paras 7 and 8). As part of the OAP, agreement was reached on the following:
(i) a full socio-economic and physical survey be carried out in each slum to
ensure that at least 80% of residents are the legal owners; (ii) there is
community participation in the scheme; (iii) households are given the oppor-
tunity to 'purchase' a water connection where feasible, and/or install lox
cost sanitation (under the low cost sanitation component of the project);
(iv) off-site infrastructure (to be recovered from the general revenues of
the local body) be provided in all slums to be upgraded; and (v) appropriate
arrangements be made for the maintenance of the upgraded slums.
5.05    Area Development.  Full cost recovery would be achieved in this
component. Assurances were given during negotiations that, in implementing
this component, development authorities will: (i) deal only with a
"society," for the purposes of securing separate agreements with individual
residents together with at least 25% down payment before commencing the work;
and (ii) recover the balance through a short term loan from individual resi-
dents at not less than 121 interest per annum.
5.06    Water and Sewerage Charges.  Investment costs in water supply and
sewerage would be recovered under the UP component through water tariffs,
charges, and water and sewer taxes. Assurances were given during nego-
tiations that project towns will cover the full cost of operation, main-
tenance, and debt service obligations on their water supply and sewerage
operations. This would be achieved through operational and financial
improvements, including tariff increases (Annex 10, para 12 (ii)). The dates
for attaining this ob3ective differ among towns. The OAP (Annex 4, Attach-
ment 1) indicates interim, monitorable targets towards that end. The costs
of water and sewerage services are affordable, taking into account the likely
increases in income levels and likely increases in price levels in future
years. The above financial objective is an interim measure pending the
results of a tariff study (see paras 4.26 and 5.07), and the revaluation of



-35-
all water and sewerage assets (OAP Annex 4). Ultimately COUP would require
that investments in water and sewerage earn a positive rate of return.
5.07    No mechanism exists for charging directly for sewerage services.  The
project includes a tariff study which would focus on: (i) review methodology
of costing, and recommends alternatives if necessary; (ii) rationalization of
the tax and meter charge elements in pricing; (iii) review and recommenda-
tions of alternative methods for recovering costs of sewerage and sanitation
operations; and (iv) recommendations for a tariff structure for project
towns, taking into account any social policies and objectives of GOUP.
5.08    Other components.  The costs of slum upgrading (additional amounts
expended in this component that exceeded the COUP's minimum needs program),
drainage, solid waste management, maintenance management, and traffic
engineering and management would be recovered indirectly through the general
revenues of local bodies. (See Annex 10, Income and Expenditure Statements
of Local Bodies).
B. Resource Mobilization
5.09    Sector policy adjustments (see para 1.16) include a major effort to
improve the general revenue position of the local bodies, including the
reduction/elimination of direct and indirect subsidies. During negotiations,
agreement was reached that project towns will generate sufficient internal
revenues to finance increasing proportions of their revenue expenditures.
The OAP (Annex 4, Attachment 2) includes interim targets towards that end.
During negotiations, assurances were also given that by March 31, 1989, COUP,
in consultation with GOI, will present for Bank/IDA review proposals to
minimize the negative effects of rent control, and thereafter, take steps to
implement any mutually agreed proposals.
VI.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Economic Evaluation
6.01    Economic rates of return (ERR's) have been calculated for about 52%
of project costs.  ERR's were calculated for water supply and sanitation (see
Annex 11 for assumptions).  Benefits were measured by incremental revenues
after 1986/87.  The average ERR for the 11 project towns in the UP program
was 10.2% at 100% labor shadow prices and 13.5% at 70% labor shadow prices.
About 20% of water produced is not billed. Collections range from about 70%
of current billings in the larger cities to about 501 in some of the smaller
towns. Although the revenue projections used are based on assumed incremen-
tal improvements in billing and collections, they probably still underes-
timate economic benefits, especially in the smaller towns where current
billing and collection performance is poor. Benefits such as external health



-36-
effects are not captured by prices and are not included in the analysis.
EaRs for sites and services, slum upgrading, and area development, are 13X,
171, and 161, respectively. Benefits were estimated using market information
on rental values of completed houses and on the sale prices of developed
land. Sensitivity analysis indicates that rent levels of 10% less than those
estimated would lower the ERRs to 12%, 13%, and II%, respectively. Rates of
return on traffic engineering and management schemes have not been worked out
as the schemes have not yet been defined. However, experience from similar
schemes in the region suggest rates of return varying from 301 to 100%.
6.02    The investments proposed under the Ganga program comprise an
integrated set of actions, and the relationship between specific benefits and
investments cannot be quantified. The investments will (i) reduce pollution
in the cities, and (ii) treat sewage before discharge onto agricultural land
or into the river. An attempt has been made in Annex 2 to identify the
benefits more precisely.
B. Impact on the Poor
6.03    The sites and services, area development, slum upgrading, low cost
sanitation and solid waste management components accounting for about 261 of
project cost will directly benefit people with incomes below the poverty
level. 1/ The remaining project components (water supply, sewerage,
drainage, maintenance, traffic engineering and management) also confer a
substantial proportion of their benefits on the poor.
6.04    The urban poverty impacts of the UP component are tabulated in Annex
12 and are summarized below:
(a) about 781 of the residential plots in the sites and services com-
ponent would be affordable to the urban poor (8,300 out of 10,640);
(b) about 90% of the households in the slum upgrading areas would be in
the urban poverty group;
(c) about 60% of the households in the area development schemes are
classified as urban poor;
(d) 1001 of the households benefiting from low cost sanitation invest-
ments would be urban poor;
(e) about 451 of the benefits of off-site water supply, sewerage and
drainage are expected to accrue to the urban poor;
1/ Assumed to be Rs 650 per month, calculated in accordance with OPN 2.07.



-37-
(f) Solid waste management improvements will accrue mostly to the low
income areas and about 70X of the benefits are expected to accrue to
the urban poor; and
(g) Traffic management measures are concentrated in the most densely
developed areas of cities, and about 45X of the benefits are expected
to accrue to the urban poor.
The benefits under the CPD Program are:
(a) improved environmental conditions for urban dwellers;
(b) improved amenities at pilgrim towns;
(c) utilization of treated effluent for irrigation; and
(d) direct health benefits for farm workers.
C. Risks
6.05    The major risks aret  (a) the capacity of IPMC to carry out appraisal
(in the event a town is dropped and additional investments in other towns, or
standby towns are brought into the project), supervision, and other support
functions; (b) the institutional capacity of towns, particularly the Group B
towns, to undertake such a large and complex program; and (c) possible
non-compliance with policy conditions relating to cost recovery and resource
mobilization.
6.06    GOUP has staffed the IPMC with its most experienced officers, almost
all of whom were involved at one stage or another in the preparation and/or
implementation of KUDP. The experience gained under KUDP has, and will be,
used to ensure effective implementation of this project. Further, COUP and
project towns recognize that productivity and service delivery are less than
satisfactory and have committed themselvec to an extensive program of techni-
cal assistance and training. Lastly, COUP and project towns have already
demonstrated a firm commitment to project objectives by implementing an
action plan agreed to in October 1984 which has already, and will further
bring about, substantial improvement in resource mobilization through
increases in water and sewer taxes and charges, octroi, and the enforcement
of legal remedies against defaulters. COUP is also taking steps to make the
property tax the long term primary source of internally generated revenue of
local bodies, and has already, on its own intiative, extended the rent "con-
trol free" period on new properties from 10 to 20 years.
6.07    In the CPD program, the potential risks are low.  The program would
address sector policy issues at the national level and in this effort GPD
will be engaging specialist consulting services to support its core team of
senior professionals to appraise, supervise and monitor the progress of the



-38-
works. Implementation would be carried out by competent authorities at the
state level who have already been selected by GPD, and have proven capability
for executing the works involved.
6.08    Land acquisition, usually a problem in urban and water supply
projects, has been minimized. In the UP component, all of the land required
for the project has already been acquired. The process of land acquisition
for sewage treatment works at Allahabad, Hardiwar, and Kanpur under the GPD
component has already started.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01    The following agreements t'ere reached at negotiations:
-   Project towns which do not meet agreed interim financial performance
targets, or which delay project implementation, will have their
capital funds reduced, and such funds will be reallocated to better
performing towns, or to standby towns, in consultation with the Bank
and IDA (para 2.05).
-   COUP and GPD will review and update annually, the OAP, to be satis-
factory to the Bank and IDA (para 2.07).

project as appraised, or any mutually agreed amendments to the
project arising during the course of implementation (para 3.07).
-   COUP will staff the low cost sanitation cell in DLB with the
appropriate disciplines required to carry out the low cost sanitation
program throughout the project period (para 4.04).

submit such audits to the Bank and IDA within nine months of the end
of each fiscal year (para 4.34).



-39-
At least 11 UP implementing agencies will retain independent commer-
cial auditors for at least the first three years of the project (para
4.34).
Independent auditors will audit SOE's and submit such audits within
nine months of the end of each fiscal year (para 4.34).
GOUP and GPD will arrange to send regular reports on the physical and
financial progress of the project performance in terms of key
indicators to the Bank and IDA (para 4.36).
GOUP and GPD will consult with the Bank and IDA on any major changes
proposed in the investment programs of the project towns (para 4.36).
The terms and conditions of lease and hire purchase agreements in the
sites and services component will be satisfactory to IDA, and inter-
est of not less than 121 p.a. will be charged to beneficiaries (para
5.02).
Slum upgrading component criteria for ownership, community participa-
tion, off-site infrastructure, and maintenance will be satisfactory
to the Bank and IDA (para 5.04).
Area development component criteria for selection of sites and
financing arrangements will be agreed on with the Bank and IDA (para
5.05).
UP project towns will cover the full cost of operation, maintenance
and debt service obligations on their water supply and sewerage
operations (para 5.06).
Project towns will generate sufficient internal revenues to finance
increasing proportions of their revenue expenditures (para 5.09).
GOUP will, in consultation with GOI, present, by March 31, 1989,
specific proposals to minimize the negative effects of rent control,
and thereafter, take steps to implement any mutually agreed proposals
(para 5.09).
7.02    On the basis of the above agreements, the project is suitable for a
Bank loan of US$20 million and an IDA credit of SDR 106.3 million (US$130
million). The Borrower would be India.

INDIA
UTTAR PRADESH URBAN DEVEWPMENT PROJECT
Uttar Pradesh: Urban Growth, Development, and Services
Uttar Pradesh
1.      Uttar Pradesh is India's largest state, with 110.8 million people
according to the 1981 census. It is one of India's poorest states, with an
average annual per capita income of only US$125, or 25% below the Indian
average. State population growth is about the same as in India as a whole,
about 2.31 over the 1971-81 period. As with the rest of India, the popula-
tion of UP is primarily rural. About 18% was classified as urban in the 1981
census. However, the urban population of UP is growing at a rate which is
faster than that for India as a whole, (4.9%, compared to 3.9% for the
national average). It is estimated that, over the next 15 years, about half
of UP's population growth will be located in urban aceas. By 2001 the UP
urban population could exceed 30%.
Economic Growth
2.      The State economy had for many decades lagged behind the ,rowth of
the rest of India. However, in recent years UP's State Domestic Product
(SDP) increased at a slightly faster rate. For example, in the Fifth Plan
period from 1974/5 to 1978/9 it was 5.7% p.a. (compared to a national average
of 5.2% p.a.). UP's target for the Sixth Plan was 6.0% p.a. (compared to
5.2% p.a. for India). The earlier lag in economic development was not
attributable to poor agricultural or industrial sector performance. It was
mainly a result of poor performance in service sectors which are
predominantly urban in their location and characteristics, such as storage,
communications, banking, public administration, and transport.  Moreover,
these sectors have continued to lag behind. Recently, however, some of the
industrial sectors which are also urban in location have shown remarkable
growth, and this has accounted for the rise in overall state growth rates
above the national average. These rapidly growing sectors include chemicals,
machinery, transport equipment, non-metallic products, and miscellaneous
manufacturing.
Economic Regions of UP
3.      It is possible to divide UP into five economic regions:  The Hills
(in the north), Western, Central, Eastern, and Bundelkhand (in the south).
The Western region leads the others in most instances and may be regarded as
the most economically advanced of the five, followed by the Central, Eastern,
Hills, and Bundelkhandp in that order. The State Government has declared the
Eastern, Hills, and Bundelkhand regions as backward. 1/
1/ Defined as areas where there are no large or medium industries.



ANNEX 1
-41-                 Page 2 of 3
4.      The main reason for the superior ecoPomic position of Western UP is
greater agricultural productivity, which in turn has led to growth in local
manufacturing and service activities and to developments of agro-industries
in the region. Another significant advantage of Western UP is its proximity
to New Delhi. Inclusion within the Delhi economy has led to industrializa-
tion opportunities not encountered elsewhere in UP. Thus, the overall pic-
ture is of a state whose economy is changing rapidly as industrialization
proceeds, but with marked differences in the economic performance between
the Western region and the other regions.
Urban Growth in the Regions
5.      The economic performance of UP is reflected in the growth rates of
the urban areas in the regions. The Western region had the fastest rate of
growth in urban population at 5.11 p.a. (apart from Bundelkhand, whose growth
was a little faster but from an extremely low base). The Western region also
has more urban areas than the others. Taking Class I, II, and III towns and
cities together, which cover all urban areas in excess of 20,000 population,
the Western region has 82 out of UP's total of 150 urban areas. It contains,
however, only one of the five largest cities of UP: namely Agra (population
0.77 m). The more sustained economic and urban growth of the Western region
compared with the others has therefore taken place in many towns and cities
which are medium rank (50,000 to 200,000 population).
6.      The less developed regions of UP do contain a few of these medium
sized towns. They are widely dispersed and have special features which may
account for their growth; for example, they act as transport centres, places
of religious importance, or have institutions such as colleges or public
administration.
7.      Of the five largest towns in UP (the KAVAL towns), one (Agra, 0.77 m
population) is located in the Central region, and two (Allahabad, 0.6 m
population, and Varanasi, 0.8 m population) in the Eastern region. Some
towns with high growth rates during 1971-81 include Chaziabad (8.6Z), Har-
diwar (6.3X), Bulandshahr (5.71), Firozabad (4.21), and Muzaffarnagar (4.1%).
New Locations for Growth and Planned Developments
8.      Another category which needs to be considered in the total urbaniza-
tion picture of UP is that of the essentially "new" urban area. Such growth
centers have two principal origins. The first is where there is exploitation
of some local economic endowment which leads to urban growth. The most
notable example is Shaktinagar in the southeast corner of the state bordering
Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, where there is a giant coal-field, a growing number
of thermal power stations, and other industrial developments which utilize
coal and/or electric power. The second instance of new urban growth derives
from the state's industrial location policies to place certain manufacturing
enterprises, such as fertilizer factories, and electronic, telephone, and



-42-                 ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 3
cement industries, in backward areas in order to create employment oppor-
tunities and help to arrest migration to the urban areas. One such area on
the borders of the Central and Eastern regions around Raebareli and Sultanpur
has some prospects of success, owing to the availability of infrastructure.
There is little evidence to show that the economic costs of these locations
have been assessed. Moreover, the employment creation is likely to be of a
type that will not help (or not directly help) local rural population.
Urban Services
9.      Wherever urbanization takes place in the UP, it does so in the con-
text of inadequate public utility infrastructure. This is a feature of the
Western region just as much as the others. Problems of urban growth are all
the more severe in the largest cities because of the greater absolute numbers
of people involved.
10.     An adequate water supply of good quality is a problem for most towns.
Most of the water developments taking place involves independent tubewell
systems, while funding for trunk infrastructure is deferred. The quantity
and quality of water supply, and the operation of a large number of independ-
ent systems, pose serious problems for agencies and consumers alike.
iI.     Sanitation receives less priority than it deserves.  Four towns have
waterborne sewer systems and have considerable operational problems. Dis-
posal methods are highly unsatisfactory and add to pollution. Low-cost
sanitation has been introduced in Kanpur under KUDP, and may provide a model
for other towns.
12.     Local government services such as solid waste management, road con-
struction, street cleaning and lighting, etc., suffer from inadequate funding
for maintenance. Service is particularly poor in low-income areas.
Municipal governments have inadequate resources to extend maintenance to
newly improved low-income areas. Community participation in the planning and
maintenance of services in these areas could be achieved if community
development support is provided. Organization of maintenance activities by
local governments needs to be radically improved. Traffic management is now
being recognized as an essential part of city services, as can be seen in
Kanpur. Serious traffic problems exist in the larger towns, due to different
modes of transport, undisciplined road use, and lack of traffic rule enforce-
ment.
13.     State provision of developed land and shelter falls far short of
needs.  COUP investments in housing are mainly intended for the poor (EWS),
yet the units constructed remain out of reach of the intended beneficiaries.
Earlier COUP sites and services projects have not been successful because
of (a) poor location, (b) minimum standards not acceptable to potential
clients, (c) bureaucratic delays, and (d) lack of enforcement and poor
credibility of government agencies. The state sponsored slum improvement
schemes presently provide water supply to slums plus other basic services
with no cost recovery.

INDIA
UTTAR PRADESH URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
GANGA ACTION PROGRAM (PHASE 1)
Background
1.      Following a survey of the Ganga Basin by the Central Board for the
Prevention and Control of Water Pollution, the Central Ganga Authority (CGA)
was established in February 1985 to undertake a comprehensive Action Plan for
Prevention of Pollution of the Ganga in parallel with initiatives taken by
Uttar Pradesh. In June 1985, the Ganga Project Directorate (GPD) was estab-
lished under the authority to coordinate the various activities of the action
plan. The CGA is responsible for the overall action plan, determination of
policies, and allocation of resources. CCA's initial efforts will focus on
sanitation and wastewater management in urban areas of UP, Bihar, and West
Bengal. The GPD reports to the CGA through the inter-departmental steering
committee and is responsible for appraisal and sanction of projects prepared
by state-level agencies and non-governmental organizations, release of funds,
project coordination and overall monitoring.
Rationale for Bank Suprort
2.      Through the CGA, the Bank could assist in the development of a
national organization which would set appropriate standards and policies for
pollution prevention and control on a multi-state basis. This assistance
would include (a) the introduction of program management systems; (b) the
development of river pollution control models; and (c) the preparation of
strategic plans for reduction and control of pollution in the Ganga River.
Pollution Control Problem
3.      The Ganga extends for a length of 2,525 kilometers, rising in the
Himalayas and discharging into the Bay of Bengal at Ganga Sagar. The Ganga
and its tributaries, with a catchment area in India of 861,404 km2, drain
parts of eight states. About 242 million people (37 percent of the total
population of India) live in the Canga basin. Of these, 84 percent live in
rural areas and the remainder (40 million) in a total of 629 urban centers.
Apart from non-point source pollution, about 100 cities with a combined
population of about 15 million discharge liquid and solid waste directly into
the Ganga, in most cases with no prior treatment. It is estimated that more
than 85 percent of the direct pollution load in the Canga derives from the 29
Class I cities (with population of about 12 million). The pollution load
from these cities is being addressed under Phase I of the Ganga Action Plan
which is programmed through 1990 at an estimated cost of about Rs 244 crores
(US$200 million).



-44-
ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 15
Canga Action Plan
4.      in most cities it is neLessary to address the pollution control
problem through a number of inter-related actions; including (a) renovation
of existing sewers; (b) construction of interceptor sewers and trapping of
surface streams (nallahs); (c) renovation and/or construction of treatment
plants; (d) energy recovery and sludge digestion; (e) construction/renovation
of sewage pump stations; and (f) development of low cost sanitation options.
Technology Issues
5.      In implementing the Action Plan, the CCA and the GPD face several key
issues outlined below.
6.      Effluent Quality Standards.  Effluent quality standards are set by
state pollution control boards under guidelines established by the Central
Water Pollution Control Board. A key issue in improving water quality in the
Canga is the degree to which effluent standards should be rigidly applied.
Especially in the case of municipal effluent, a more flexible approach to the
application of effluent quality standards might enable broader coverage of
pollution control measures within available capital and operating budgets.
Consideration could be given to the relation of effluent standards to river
flow and quality characteristics. The optmimum degree of pollution load
which the river can accommodate at any point would be considered. This issue
is already being addressed under a river modeling program being undertaken by
GPD's corporate consultancy advisors. The self-purifying capacity of the
Ganga is well known, and this would need to be exploited to the fullest
extent. In general, the unit cost of sewage treatment increases very sub-
stantially as higher effluent quality standards are sought. Primary treat-
ment on a very large scale is therefore likely to be more cost effective than
secondary and tertiary treatment of limited quantities. The river water is
used extensively for agriculture; the annual consumption drawn from the Ganga
amounts to about 85 billion cubic meters to irrigate a command area around
153,009 VW. The flow in the river is therefore critical, and this con-
sideration may influence greater development of the groundwater potential
in the Canga basin which, on the whole, is presently underutilized. The most
vulnerable section of the river, from the pollution point of view, is the
stretch from Haridwar to Allahabad. Below Allahabad the Canga is joined by
its major tributary, the Yamuna, which contributes almost 60 percent of the
total flow. Coordination with irrigation authorities will be important in
this regard.
7.      Treatment Processes.  A large number of treatment alternatives is
available, including both conventional and non-conventional processes
amenable to resource utilization. The costs and resources (manpower, energy,
capital, plant, land, etc.) which are required vary substantially and are



-45-
ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 15
site specific. Staged process development may be the most cost-effective way
of providing the most far reaching benefits in the short term.
8.      Resource Recovery and Marketing.  The Action Plan is predicated on
substantial recovery of operation and maintenance costs from the sale of the
by-products of the sewage treatment process (methane gas, plant nutrients,
fertilizer and effluent). The sale of such by-products is totally dependent
on the availability of an appropriate market. Experience elsewhere shows
that a variety of factors may reduce revenue to much less than might be
expected. For example, the location of sewage treatment works is seldom
optimum for the sale of such a diverse range of products. Location is
usually governed by the need to minimize capital and operating cost and
environmental impact. Any additional marketing costs must be factored into
the overall analysis of the scheme costs and viability. The pollution con-
trol objective can sometimes be compromised by marketing considerations as is
happening at the Okhla works in Delhi, where power failures result in a
deterioration of effluent quality due to the need to maintain customers' gas
supplies instead of using standby power generation for activated sludge
aerators. These problems suggest that thorough economic analysis is required
to assure the viability of resource recovery schemes.
9.      Data Collection.  Data collection is important to monitor river
quality and to design cost-effective programs to improve water quality. Data
should be appropriate and available on a timely basis to decision makers.
Data provides the basis for important decisions on process operations. Since
1980, routine sampling and analysis have been undertaken at 38 monitoring
stations throughout the length of the Ganga between Haridwar and Diamond
Harbour to provide a water quality data base. It is known that there are
large variations of quality across the width of the Ganga and along its
length. Cost-effective means of collecting the most essential data need to
be considered. For example, improved information may show the possibility of
providing pollution control through dilution by mixing or mid-stream outfalls
in lieu of treatment. Economies in data gathering may be achievable by
reducing the number of parameters measured or by transporting samples to
central laboratories rather than testing them in the field. Automatic
monitoring stations would also contribute to cost effectiveness in this
respect.
Institutional Arrangements
10.     Overall responsibility for the Ganga Action Plan (GAP) rests with the
CCA; which is chaired by the Prime Minister of India. CGA meets quarterly.
Coordination of the plan is carried out by the Ganga Steering Committee, with
the GPD serving as a secretariat for detailed implementation of the plan.
GPD would have overall responsibility for sanctioning investments under the
Ganga component but would delegate to the State Governments responsibility
for ezecuting the specific sub-components in their respective states. This



-46-
ANNEX 2
Page 4 of 15
responsibility would be delegated to State agencies as follows for implemen-
tation of the worksS
Bihar       - Bihar State Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BISWAS)
UP          - UP Jal Nigam
West Bengal - Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and
the State Public Health and Engineering Directorate
(PHED)
The States may also designate other agencies to assist in implementing this
component.
11.     These agencies would be responsible for implementation of the
priority rehabilitation works, including preparation of tender documents for
the sewage treatment plants, preparation of bid evaluation reports for review
and approval by GPD, and supervision of construction. In UP, the Investment
Planning Monitoring Cell (IPMC) would be responsible for procurement of sewer
cleaning equipment and its distribution to the respective Jal Sansthans and
Nagar Mahapalikas. IPMC would be responsible also for the procurement of
such equipment in Bihar. An organization chart is given in Appendix 1.
Operation and Maintenance
12.     Physical investment in the Ganga program can be divided into three
categories:
(i) Repair of existing infrastructure;
(ii) Expansion of existing infrastructure; and
(iii) New facilities.
13.     The operation and maintenance reponsibility of the repaired and
expanded infrastructure facilities (items (i) and (ii)) would remain with the
relevant local authority (Jal Sansthans and Nagar Mahapaliisas). The State
agencies (UP Jal Nigam, BISWAS, CMDA, and PHED) would initially be respon-
sible for maintaining new facilities executed under the Ganga component.
These state agencies would also be responsible for the training of staff of
the local authorities.
14.     To the extent that local authorities and state agencies may not be in
a position to raise sufficient revenues to operate and maintain expanded and
new facilities, GPD would contribute any necessary additional resources
required during the Seventh Plan Period (through March 31, 1990). There-
after, in the event that GPD is dismantled, the ownership of new facilities



-47-
ANNEX 2
Page 5 of 15
created under the project would be vested in the respective State Govern-
meuts. The State authorities would initially be responsible for operating
new facilities.
15.     However, in order to address the issue of long term institutional and
financial arrangements for effective operation and maintenance of new
facilities, GPD has set up an expert committee with the following terms of
reference:
(a) review existing technology employed in treatment facilities;
(b) review the existing arrangements for operation and maintenance and
standards;
(c) quantify the costs of the various items for operation and main-
tenance;
(d) fix standards for operation and maintenance and quantify the costs;
(e) review organizational issues relating to operation and maintenance;
(f) consider various technology options in treatment processes and the
cost of operation and maintenance of similar plants for different
technology options;
(g) identify resource recovery possibilities; and
(h) recommend appropriate norms and standards for operation and main-
tenance of treatment facilities considering the various items of
costs, resource recovery, technology options and capacities.
This committee is expected to report its findings to GPD shortly. However,
the Government of Uttar Pradesh has already given a commitment to finance
operation and maintenance of new facilities in Uttar Pradesh State beyond the
7th Plan period in the event that GPD is dismantled.
Ganga Component Description
16.     The Ganga component would provide (a) consultancy advisory services
and training; (b) pollution monitoring and maintenance equipment; and (c)
priority pollution control works. Details of the Ganga component with all
inclusive costs are summarized below:
I. Technical Assistance (Rs 3.01 crores; US$2.31 million). Appointment
of consultants to assist CPD to undertake:
(a) Environmental impact studies.



-48-
ANEX 2
Page 6 of 15
(b) Corporate consultancy advisory services (following up Phase I
studies).
(c) Sewer condition assessment, identification of remedial works,
program, and costs, financing arrangements.
(d) Program consultants to assist GPD in (1) program monitoring; (2)
technical assessment of schemes; and (3) review of tender docu-
ments for turnkey projects.
(e) River quality monitoring assessment and documentation.
(f) Assistance for GPD in programming and preparation of rehabilita-
tion works not yet identified.
II.  Training (Rs 0.78 crores; US$0.60 million).  Training for staff of
GPD and its implementing agencies including:
(a) Development of training needs and program.
(b) Training institution availability and capability.
(c) Formulating training institutional arrangements.
(d) Overseas and local training requirements.
(e) Automatic river monitoring technology.
(f) Use of specialized sewer cleaning equipment.
III. Priority Equipment (Rs 5.49 crores; US$4.22 million)
(a) Supply jetting machines, gully pit emptiers, rodding and bucket
cleaning machines, loaders, and related equipment for sewer
cleaning operations in about 54 units.
(b) Supply of 11 automatic water sampling and analysing units and
related equipment.
IV. Priority Pollution Control Works (Rs 53.78 crores; US$41.37 million)
(a) Construction of 60 million liters per day (mld) capacity was-
tewater treatment plant at Allahabad, together with staff
quarters.



-49-
ANNEX 2
Page 7 of 15
(b) Construction of 18 mld capacity wastewater treatment plant at
Haridwar, together with staff quarters.
(c) Construction of 135 mld capacity wastewater treatment plant at
Kanpur, together with staff quarters.
(d) Construction of other priority pollution control works to be
identified. These would be based on detailed studies to be
undertaken by nominated executing agencies in Bihar, Uttar
Pradesh, and West Bengal with appropriate consultant assistance,
and submitted for IDA review after evaluation by GPD and its
advisors.
17.     Turakey Contracts.  Contracts for sewage treatment works at
Allahabad, HarLdwar, and Kanpur would be invited on a turnkey basis from
prequalified contractors under ICB procedures. The turnkey contracts would
include designs, civil works, mechanical and electrical equipment, commis-
sioning, and initial operation against performance requirements.
18.     Detailed engineering studies have been completed for the proposed
works at Allahabad, Haridwar, and Kanpur. These studies have considered
alternative technology options to determine least cost designs. In the case
of Allahabad, a comparison of capital, operation and maintenance, and land
costs undertaken by UP Jal Nigam indicated that stabilization ponds and the
activated sludge process costs are about equal. At Kanpur, in view of the
problems of land acquisition, it is likely that conventional treatment with
activated sludge secondary treatment would provide the optimal solution.
19.     In order that GPD may gain the best advantage from available technol-
ogy options, turnkey contractors would be invited to submit process designs
to meet specified effluent quality standards. Land availability, operation
and maintenance, resource recovery, environmental impact, and related con-
siderations would be taken into account in evaluating the offers. This
consideration would include the impact of staged effluent quality improvement
and budgetary constraints.
Costs and Financing
20.     Cost Estimate.  The cost estimate for the Ganga component of the
project (base cost 1986/87) is summarized below:

Notes
1. Base cost figures include supervision and management costs.
2. Rs 13.0 = US$1.0.
3. Costs include 5 taxes and duties where appropriate.
21.     Implementation.  The above costs have been calculated on the basis of
an eight year implementation period, with disbursements extending over nine
years. The GPD intends to implement the Ganga component during the Seventh
Plan Period through March 31, 1990. In this event the overall cost of the
Ganga component would be reduced to about Rs 57.77 crores (US$44.4 million)
due to the shorter implementation period.
22.     Procurement.  Consulting services contracts would be awarded in
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency," August 1981 edi-
tion. Contracts for civil works and the supply of equipment would be
procured in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits," May 1985 edition. Local competitive bidding (LCB)

procedures which are adopted in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal States
have been reviewed to determine their conformity with the above guidelines.
Further details are presented in Section IV, sub-section B.
23.     Schedule of Contracts.  The contracts which have been identified
under the Canga component are listed in the following table, which also
indicates the bidding procedure and the processing timetable.
24.     Financing - Capital Costs.  The proceeds of Bank financing towards
the Ganga component of the UP project would be passed on by GOI to GPD as
grant. This is consistent with the GAP strategy that all capital expenditure
under the program would be financed on a grant basis. Expenditures under the
Bank financed component would be approved like other Ganga Action Plan expen-
ditures, with the following limits:
Up Rs 1.0 crores         -      Project Director of CPD
From Rs 1.0-5.0 crores   -      Steering Comittee of the Central
Ganga Authority (CCA)
Above Rs 5.0 crores       -     CGA
25.     Financing - Operation and Maintenance Costs.  Some operating and
maintenance costs of project works executed under the Ganga Action Plan would
be financed by CPD during the Seventh Five Year Plan period comprising
incremental costs only on the following basis:
(i) Full operating and maintenance costs of new facilities, such as
sewage treatment plants.
(ii) Incremental costs of facilities enlarged under the GAP.
(iii) No contribution would be made by GPD towards the operating costs
of equipment rehabilitated under the CAP but whose capacity
remains the same as before.
The financing and institutional arrangments for operating and maintaining
new facilities from 1990 were discussed during negotiations (refer to para
4.20).

ANNEX 2
Page 11 of 15
Benefits and Justification
26.     Benefits.  The investments proposed under the Ganga component of the
UP urban development project comprise an integrated set of actions, and it is
not easy to quantify the relationship between specific benefits and invest-
ments. Nevertheless, the potential benefits and beneficiaries are identified
in this section. Two main sets of actions are considered; (i) the reduction
of pollution in the cities, including the cleaning and rehabilitation of
existing sewers and pump stations, and the interception and tapping of nal-
lahs (storm drains) that currently discharge directly into the Ganga; and
(ii) the treatment of sewage before its discharge onto agricultural land or
into the Ganga River. Some of the benefits can be quantified. Others are
considered qualitatively.
27.     Improved Sewage Conveyance.  Investments relating to the cleaning and
rehabilitation of the existing sewer network include the purchase of jetting
machines and bucket sewer cleaning equipment. The Ganga Action Plan also
includes the rehabilitation of sewage pump stations and civil works to inter-
cept the dry weather flow of nallahs that are significantly contributing to
the pollution of the Ganga. The main benefit of these investments will be
(i) the improved environmental and living conditions for the city dwellers,
particularly the urban poor; and (ii) improved ammenit; value of the Ghats
(bathing places) located along the river banks in the project cites. This
latter benefit is particularly important at Allahabad, Haridwar and Varanasi,
which are visited by millions of pilgrims annually foz the specific purpose
of taking a "holy dip" in the sacred Ganga River. Ovet time, these actions
would also improve the urban enviroment by reducing backing-up of sewers and
sewage flows in open storm drains, contributing to increased rental values of
properties.
28.     Farmers' Benefits.  At the present time, raw sewage is used for the
irrigation of farm land, partly owned by municipal authorities and partly in
private ownership. In principle, the raw sewage is diluted with river water
or ground water, but at the present time only a small proportion of the
sewage is applied to the land, with the major part being discharged directly
into the Ganga, since the main sewage pump stations are mostly out of serv-
ice.
29.     There is a great demand for sewage for crop irrigation in the
environs of the cities located along the banks of the Ganga. Major benefits
would result from the rehabilitation of the sewage pumping stations and the
irrigation channels on the existing sewage farms by fully utilizing the
available sewage flow. It would appear that there is sufficient municipally
and privately owned land available to make use of all the sewage effluent
that is likely to be available well into the next century. From an agricul-
tural standpoint, farmers generally have a need for irrigation water only for



-54-
ANNEX 2
Page 12 of 15
about nine months of the year, from October until June, since seasonal mon-
soon rainfall provides crop water requirements during the three remaining
months. However, during this period (July-September), there would be negli-
gible pollution from direct discharge of either primary or secondary treated
effluent into the Ganga, since there is enough water in the river to provide
a dilution of more than one thousand to one, as is shown in Appendix 2,
Table 1.
30.     In addition, there may be *-ntermittent occasions during the harvest-
ing of some crops when all the effluent may not be required for irrigation
and would need to be discharged directly into the Ganga. Effluent quality
should therefore be suitable for discharging into inland surface waters and
for use in agriculture for irrigation purposes.
31.     Downstream Beneficiaries.  Pollution levels in the Ganga may be
expected to fall considerably both within and downstream of each of the
cities in which the project is implemented. Reductions in biochemical oxygen
demand, suspended solids, and pathogen levels are anticipated even if the
effluent quality standards recommended by the Central Water Pollution Control
Board are not fully met immediately. Major benefits will therefore accrue to
people who make use of the Ganga waters downstream of the cities in which the
project actions take place. This is most important in the stretch of the
Ganga between Haridwar and Allahabad, where due to major abstractions of
water for irrigation for much of the year the remaining flows provide insuf-
ficient dilution to permit natural regenerative capacity to the river to
reduce pollution between the main cities. The economics of pollution control
must therefore be considered in the context of the whole stretch of the river
and cannot be judged solely by city specific considerations. In this respect
the investments in river modeling and monitoring equipment would ultimately
contribute to overall improvement in river quality management, to the benefit
of both city and rural dwellers throughout the length of the Ganga.
32.     Benefits from Sewage Treatment.  The present practice of discharging
untreated sewage onto farmland is unsatisfactory for the following reasons:
(i) there is a risk of infection from consumption of sewage irrigated
vegetables due to uncontrolled cropping pattern on sewage irrigated land;
(ii) studies have shown that 80X of farm workers handling raw sewage are
infected by intestinal parasites (almost three times above the normal infec-
tion rate); and (iii) farmers complain of "soil sickness" as a result of
irrigation with untreated sewage effluent, due to lack of aeration in the
soil, blocking of soil pores by the fine suspended solids, and over-watering,
resulting in short term waterlogging of the soils.
33.     Sewage treatment would (i) reduce pathogen levels, with resulting
direct health benefits for farm workers; (ii) both primary treated effluent
proposed initially and secondary treated effluent likely in the long term
under the Ganga Action Plan would provide an effluent of satisfactory quality



-55-
ANNEX 2
Page 13 of 15
acceptable for use in irrigated agriculture, although uncontrolled cropping
with vegetables would not be recormmnded without chlorination; (iii) sig-
nificant improvements in crop yields may be expected as a result of sewage
treatment; and (iv) digested sludge would provide a soil conditioner low in
pathogens and high in nutrients for agricultural use.
Least Cost Solutions
34.     Detailed engineering studies have been prepared by the UP Jal Nigam
for three sewage treatment plants (STPs) at Allahabad, Haridwar, and Kanpur
in UP for financing under the Canga component. Several treatment alterna-
tives have been considered including: activated sludge process (ASP), trick-
ling filters (TF), aerated ponds (AP), and stabilization ponds (SP), in order
to determine the least cost solutions. Bank participation in the project
preparation has ensured that major engineering components were analyzed for
cost effectiveness and least cost solutions determined.
35.     Allahabad.  Capital and operating costs for three sites and three
treatment options were compared in order to select the least cost solution.
The analysis prepared by the UP Jal Nigam indicates that the Naini site,
where land belonging to the Nagar Mahapalika is available and treated
effluent could be discharged into the Ganga downstream of the Sangam bathing
place would provide the least cost alternative. Costs of sewage treatment
would be similar for the ASP and SP processes, but a land area of 162 hec-
tares (ha) would be required for SP. Although this amount of land is owned
by the Nagar Nahapalika, it would not be feasible to develop the area for
stabilization ponds due to (i) the environmental impact on existing villages
and housing; and (ii) the sloping topography of the area. An area of 40 ha
level ground has been selected which provides sufficient space for an ASP
treatment plant. This option would provide the most effective design in this
case.
36.     Haridwar.  Three different sewage treatment options were evaluated
indicating similar least costs for the ASP ard AP processes and higher cost
for the SP process, on account of the large land area required (2.0 ha/mld)
and high land costs ($40,000/ha). The ASP was selected over the AP to con-
serve agricultural land. However, it is possible that other treatment proces-
ses may be proposed during tendering for the turnkey contract for treatment
works. It is possible that a combination of anaerobic and aerobic ponds
could provide the most economic solution, since the area required would only
be about 0.4 ha/mld or a total of 7-8 ha, which could easily be found on the
existing sewage farm that belongs to the Nagar Mahapalika.
37.     Kanpur.  A similar comparison of treatment options was carried out
for Kanpur. In this case, the limited availability of suitable land on which
to locate treatment facilities (40 ha) dictates that ASP is adopted as the



-56-
ANNEX 2
Page 14 of 15
most effective treatment process. Stabilization ponds would require about
200 ha of land.
38.     Sludge Digestion.  An objective of the Ganga Action Plan is to con-
serve resources and to maximize the potential for resource recovery where
possible. Digestion of sewage sludge and the production of biogas for elec-
tricity generation have been included in the sewage treatment plants. The
justification for these investments is based on the relative costs of provid-
ing electricity for operation of the plants, and also on need for reliability
and to conserve national resources. Reliability is particularly important in
India since power outages of up to six hours are fairly frequent. Stand-by
power generation capacity is essential to avoid interruption to sewage con-
veyance and treatment operations. Sewage pump stations rehabilitated under
the Canga Action Plan include diesel stand-by generators to ensure uninter-
rupted pumping during power outages.
39.     The figures provided by the UP Jal Nigam indicated that electricty
generation from biogas would be sufficient to meet the full power require-
ments for ASP treatment. However, taking into account the operating
experiences of the Okhla ASP sewage treatment plant in Delhi and elsewhere,
it is likely that gas generated from digestion of sludge would certainly be
sufficient to cover the power requirements for primary sedimentation and
digestion but might not meet the full power requirements for ASP secondary
treatment.
40.     Leaving aside the questions of reliability of electricity supply from
the State Electricity Boards (SEBs) and conservation of resources, it would
be marginally less costly at present electricity price levels (Rs 0.6/kwh)
for the STPs to purchase electricity from the grid than to generate their own
power from biogas when the capital costs of biogas generation and dual-fuel
powered generators are taken into account. However, the cost of peak power
generation is at least twice this level, and it is likely that off-peak and
peak power tariffs will be introduced in the future so that the cost of power
consumption reflects better its economic cost. To this end, the National
Thermal Power Corporation plans to start charging the SEBs differential rates
for peak period power.  Therefore, it is likely that within the foreseeable
future it will be financially viable (as well as economic from the standpoint
of the national economy) for the STPs to generate some or all of their elec-
tricity requirements from biogas during the peak periods, and to limit their

powered generators would therefore be sized to meet the emergency stand-by
requirements of the STPs.

and use its water in addition to the beneficiaries in the cities in which the
investments take place. On this basis the costs of construction for the GAP,
including the Ganga component of the UP project, will be made on a grant
basis by GOI to the implementing state and city level agencies. Recovery of
capital investment costs is not envisaged. Nevertheless, it is envisaged
that the full cost of operation and maintenance of the facilities will have
to be met by local authorities within a certain period of time. Moreover,
these agencies will themselves have to start assuming responsibilities for
replacements and future investments in environmental pollution control.
42.     Projections of future income and revenue have been made for the
participating towns to ascertain their capacity to afford to continue main-
taining the infrastructure to be provided under the CAP. These indicate that
investments should be phased over several years, in order to moderate the
rate of increase of maintenance costs, since there is a limit to the rate
at which municipal revenues can be expected to rise. The initial provision
of primary treatment, comprising sedimentation and sludge digestion, would
minimize the additional financial burden on the local authorities, who
already have ongoing financial commitments for water supply and sewerage. In
the longer term, revenue enhancement and improved financial health of the
benefiting authorities could provide a basis for further improvement of
effluent quality standards.
43.     Annex Tables 2-4 compare estimated sanitation costs and revenues for
Allahabad, Haridwar, and Kanpur on completion of the Phase I of the Ganga
Action Plan by 1993/94. Annual expenditures for operation and maintenance
will have increased about fourfold, taking into account the cost of maintain-
ing the rehabilitated sewerage system and the cost of operating primary or
secondary sewage treatment and sludge digestion. The municipalities estimate
that annual revenues for sanitation, which are based on rental values, would
also increase considerably by 1993/94 to meet the financial covenants
proposed under this project. On this basis, the operating and maintenance
deficit for primary treatment is estimated to be about 6-7 percent of the
projected income of the three Nagar Mahapalikas for which feasibility studies
have been prepared. In the event that secondary treatment is provided, this
deficit would be about 8-10 percent of the projected income of the local
authorities.
44.     Ganga Action Program (GAP).  The investment required to provide
secondary treatment at Haridwar, Kanpur, and Allahabad, as proposed in the
feasibility studies prepared by the UP Jal Nigam, is estimated at about Rs 44
crores, 18 percent of the total Rs 244 crores ($200 million) Phase I of the
GAP, which has been sanctioned in the Seventh Five Year Plan. This compares
with a figure of Rs 34 crores estimated for the three sewage treatment plants
in the GAP (14% of the Plan provision). Primary treatment as a first stage
development would reduce the investment in the three STPs by about 35 percent
(from Rs 44 crores to Rs 29 crores), thus enabling the overall CAP program to
remain within its estimated budget.

UTTAR PRADESH URBAN DEVEWPMENT PROJECT
City Profiles
The following Group A and B cities were identified for inclusion in
the project, based on size, growth rates, urban infrastructure deficits,
economic potential, and institutional capacity. They appear in descending
order of importance. The city of Meerut (population 540,000) which should
appear as No. 6 below (at the top of Group B) has been excluded from the
project, since it comes under the National Capital Region for planning and
development purposes.
Croup A
Kanpur (population 1/ 1,688,000; annual growth rate 2/ 2.8X)
Kanpur, situated in the Central region on the Ganga River, is the
largest and most important industrial city in UP, and the eighth largest
metropolis in India. The city's industry was initially established in the
mid 1800's in cotton and wool textile mills, followed by tanning and leather
making industries. After Independence, fertilizer, armaments, light
engineering, agricultural and chemical plants were added. The city suffers
from a lack of adequate shelter (about 451 of households live in slums), and
its environmental and health conditions are regarded as among the worst in
the cities of India.
A8ra (population 770,000; annual growth rate 2.01)
Agra is situated in the Western region on the right bank of the
Yamuna River about 200 km from Delhi. The city has great historical impor-
tance, having been the capital of the Mughals for some time. The Taj Mahal
is located in Agra, and other famous relics of the Mughal empire are located
nearby. Agra is an important air, rail, and road junction, and is thus well
connected to other cities in the state, as well as Delhi, Calcutta, and
Patna. The most critical problems facing Agra are scarcity of water and poor
environmental and sanitation conditions.

Varanasi (population 794,000; annual growth rate 2.7Z)
Varanasi is situated in the Eastern region about 700 km from Calcutta
and Delhi. It stands on a crescent-shaped ridge on the left bank of the
Ganga River, which at this point runs approximately south to north. It is
one of the most ancient cities of India and from the beginning has been a
place for pilgrimage, and a center of religion, culture, and learning.
Varanasi lacks adequate shelter, water supply, sewage treatment, and drainage
facilities. The project proposes to address these problems.
Allahabad (population 642,000; annual growth rate 2.3X)
Allahabad is situated in the Eastern region on the confluence of the
Yamuna and Canga River, Like Varanasi to the east, it is a sacred Hindu city
where the faithful make periodic pilgrimages. It is an important city educa-
tionally, culturally, and administratively, with several central and state
government offices. Allahabad has good road and rail transportation links
with other major cities of the state, and with Calcutta and Delhi. Its main
problem areas are in shelter, water supply, sewerage and sewage treatment,
and drainage, which the project will address.
Lucknow (population 1,,OOOOOO; annual growth rate 2.1X)
Lucknow is in the Central region and is located on both sides of the
Gomti river. It is the capital of the state and a city of historic impor-
tance beginning in the Nawabi period to the end of British rule in India. It
is also important as a cultural, educational, and medical center. Lucknow
has proposed investments in all components of the project except area
development.
Group B
Bareilly (population 438,000; annual growth rate 3.01)
Bareilly is in the Western region, about 230 km from Lucknow, and
250 km from Delhi. It is situated on the Ramganga River, and is well con-
nected by road and rail to the other major cities of the state. It is the
division headquarters for the Northeastern Railway and an important center
for light and heavy industry (rubber, campher, sugar). Urban service
deficiencies are mainly water supply, sewerage, and drainage.
Moradabad (population 348,000; annual growth rate 3.0t).
Moradabad, the eighth most populous city of UP,, is situated between
the Rauganga River in the northeast, and the Canga River in the southwest.
It is famous for its brassware (a big foreign exchange earner) and cottage



-65-
ANNEX 3

industries. There are good road and rail transortation connections to other
major urban areas of the state, and to Delhi. The city's main deficiencies
are in shelter, water supply, and drainage.
Gorakhpur (population 306,000; annual growth rate 2.82)
Corakhpur is in the Eastern region, some 265 km from Lucknow, 210
km from Varanasi, 260 km from Allahabad, 820 km from Calcutta, and 50 km from
the Nepalese border. It is located at the confluence of the Rapti and Rohin
Rivers. It is the headquarters for the Northeastern Railway. Corakhpur
University and a large fertilizer factory enhance its importance in the
region.   Shelter, slum upgrading, and water supply are the principal invest-
ments proposed.
Aligarh (population 320,000; annual growth rate 2.7X)
Aligarh is in the Western region. It is situated between two major
drainsS Jafari in the north and east, Aligarh in the south. The city is
divided into two parts by the Northern Railway main line. Aligarh is propos-
ing major investments in shelter, water supply, and sewerage.
Saharanpur (population 294,000; annual growth rate 2.71)
Saharanpur is located in the Western region close to the border with
the State of Haryana. The Yamuna River, which separates Haryana from UP,
forms the western boundary of the district of Saharanpur. It is well con-
nected by road and rail to Lucknow and other important centers in the state,
and to Delhi. It is an important commercial and industrial town. Major
improvements are required in the provision of water supply, sewerage, and
drainage.
Ghaziabad (population 292,000; annual growth rate 8.42)
Chaziabad is in the Western Region, about 30 km from Delhi, and 470
km from Lucknow. The city developed from the amalgamation of three villages
in the 18th century. At the end of the 19th century it became famous for its
food grain market. Its proximity to Delhi now accounts for its phenomenal
growth, and many housing estates have sprung up in recent years. It is also
an important industrial base. The Hindon River, flowing north to south,
divides the city into two distinct areas: Ghaziabad city, and Trans Hindon
Area. Ghaziabads priorities under the project are water supply, sewerage,
and solid waste management.

Group C
Shaktinagar, in Mirzapur District in the southeast part of the state,
is part of the Singrauli area bordering on Madhya Pradesh, where major coal
deposits are located. Coal mining, power generation, and related develop-
ments are creating unplanned and unserviced colonies in the area. QOUP has
set up a Special Area Development Authority to plan for future development.
Pending the outcome of studies under the project, a notional allocation of
funds is being provided for investments in sites and services, water supply,
drainage, and traffic engineering and management.
Standby Towns
Naini Tal (population 27,000; located in Hill region)
Nainital is a popular tourist resort and its chief attraction is the
lake. Overdevelopment, however, has led to severe pollution of the lake,
which is also the town's chief water source.

UTTAR PRADESH URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Detailed Description of Selected Project Components
Sector Management, Technical Assistance, and Training
1.      In sector management, the Town and Country Planning Department (TCPD)
would retain consultants to prepare an outline development strategy for new
urban areas. The strategy initially would be applied in the GROUP C town -
Shaktinagar (see para 2.04). Within TCPD also, GOUP would create a Traffic
and Transportation Appraisal Unit (TTAU) to assist in evolving appropriate
traffic and transport policies, and provide technical support at the city
level. At the latter level, traffic engineering and management cells (TENCs)
would be established in the municipal corporations of the KAVAL towns (except
Kanpur, where such a cell was set up under KUDP).
2.      The component includes initiatives to address some of the state's
fundamental policy issues. There would be a major effort to strengthen
municipal finances (see paras 6.08). The issue of rent control will also be
addressed. In the context of the Bombay Urban Development Project, GOI has
provided its statement of intent in the Approach Paper to the Seventh Five
Year Plan as an indication of its commitment to move ahead on this issue. In
the Gujarat Urban Development Project, the Municipal Corporation Act has been
amended to enable corporations to value rental properties on the basis of
actual, as opposed to 'standard' rent as a first step towards more fundamen-
tal changes in property valuation. The proposed amendment to the Delhi Rent
Control Act, which could guide other states seeking to pass similar legisla-
tion, and the efforts of Maharashtra and Gujarat to seek rent control reform,
are welcome signs of movement in this direction.
3.      Technical assistance would be sought for (i) leak detection and
repair in the KAVAL towns, (ii) base and utility mapping and inventory in all
project towns, and (iii) a water tariff study to rationalize the tax and
uateE charge elements in pricing, including recommendations for alternative
methods of recovering costs of sewerage and sanitation operations.
4.      COUP recognize that a sustained training program is required to
complement the policy initiatives begun during project preparation, and to
improve the management and efficiency of service delivery. To that end, at
least eight clusters of training requirements ranging from daily operations
and maintenance activities to city level planning have been identified.
Existing State and National level training institutes would be used to train
senior and middle level management, supplemented in some cases by overseas
fellowships and training. After the 'training of trainers,' substantial
numbers of operational level staff would be trained at frequent intervals
locally. IPMC would be responsible for coordinating all training programs



-79-
ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 6
for which it has retained the services of a training consultant. In some
cases (e.g. leak detection and repair consultancy, purchase of specialized
equipment) an element of training would form an integral part of the con-
tract.
Sites and Services
5.      All project towns (except Kanpur, where sites and services schemes
were constructed under KUDP) would for the first time be implementing schemes
designed for more efficient land use with up to 501 more saleable land than
in their previous schemes, and differential land pricing to reduce plot costs
for EWS and LIC. Site design is to be based on a model site layout for about
eight hectares of land serving about 5,500 population. The design charac-
teristics would make about 781 of the plots affordable to low income (EWS and
LIG) households (average 5.5 persons) earning Rs. 1,500 per month or less.
An average of about 651 of each site would be marketable. Plot sizes would
vary from 27-42 m2 for EWS to 162-300 m2 for HIG. An average density of
about 432 persons per hectare would be achieved in these sites.
6.      All sites would have independent water supply and low cost sanitation
except in Lucknow and Kanpur, where connection to existing sewerage networks
is available. Most EWS plots would front on to 3-4.5 m pedestrian lanes of
brick paving. Larger plots for LIG, MIG, HIC and industrial and commercial
plots would front on to vehicular roads of 6-12 m width with single or double
lane bituminous surfacing. All sites would be served by electricity networks
and street lighting. Community facilities like primary schools, primary
health centers, police posts, and post offices would be provided.
Slum Upgrading
7.      The program would improve the provision of basic services such as
water supply, sanitation, access, electricity, etc., to meet the communities'
needs on the basis of their ability to pay. Community participation would be
sought in planning the improvements, with individual home improvement to be
carried out on a self-help basis. COUP proposes to supplement the ongoing
Environmental Improvement of Slums under its Minimum Needs Program (MNP) with
project funds to ensure an adequate level of upgrading. Project funds would
be on-lent to the municipal bodies for off-site infrastructure, and to
beneficiaries for individual water connections and low cost sanitation.
8.      If Kanpur elects to upgrade its remaining 'ahatas' 1/ also, they
would first be acquired under the Slum Areas (Clearance and Improvement) Act
of 1962, as amended in the light of experience gained under KUDP. If dif-
ficulties in acquisition continue to arise notwithstanding amendments to the
above act, Kanpur could proceed to improve its ahatas under HIP. The use of
project funds for on-site infrastructure wGuld not be permitted in such cases
since residents do not have legal tenure. However, the costs of any off-site
1/ slums on privately owned land, generally in the center of the city.



-80-
AM=H S
Page 3 of 6
infrastructure associated with any ahata improved under NIP would be eligible
for financing.
Water Supply
9.      The IAVAL towns (Croup A) all use as their major source of water
supply the rivers on which they are sited, 1/ with some use of groundwater as
well. The Group B towns are wholly dependent on groundwater for their sup-
plies.
10.     All the towns are short of water, particularly in the summer months.
Allahabad and Varanasi have special problems; both attract enormous crowds of
pilgrims (up to 10 million, it has been estimated) over short periods and are
in even more serious difficulties at these times than normally. To take the
example of Kanpur (Group A), supply at present is thought to be aboat 702 of
demand. However, there, and in all the other towns, production figures are
little more than estimates, since there are few measurements of water being
put into supply. Similarly, although metering of consumer connections is
widespread, many meters are out of order and there are also mny unmetered
connections. The project will place special emphasis on metering - produc-
tion, zonal, and consumption. In addition, leak detection and repair, and
waste prevention will form an important part of the project, and technical
assistance will be provided to train staff in the use of appropriate techni-
ques and equipment.
11.     The works to be carried out under the project will follow existing
patterns. Kanpur, Varanasi, and Lucknow will develop further their river
intake arrangements and increase treatment capacity, either by extending
existing plants or constructing new ones. Raw water and clear water pumping
arrangements together with associated transmission mains have been included
in the proposals. Dredging operations will be necessary at Lucknow but more
particularly at Kanpur because the main streams of the rivers have receded
from the intake locations. The channels leading from the main river streams
to the intakes are constantly dredged, and the project includes provision for
overhauling existing dredgers.
12.     At Allahabad, and at all the Croup B towns, groundwater will be
developed to provide additional supplies. The numbers of tubewells to be
provided under the project will be Allahabad 16, Bareilly 1, Moradabad 1,
Gorakhpur 5, Aligarh 8, Saharanpur 9, and Chaziabad 17; 63 in all.
Chlorinators, overhead tanks, pumphouses, and other ancillary works would be
provided to an appropriate scale.
13.    Agra's principal source of water is the Yamuna River.  During the
summer months, when wator is drawn from the Yamuna at a barrage mny miles
upstream of Agra to feed an irriga.ion canalp flow in the river is reduced to
1/ Kanpur, Varanasi - Canga; Agra - Yamuns; Allahabad - Ganga and Yamunaa
Lucknow - Gomti.



-81-
AWMEX 5
Page 4 of 6
a level insufficient to meet Agra's needs. To deal with this difficulty an
arrangement has been made to release water from the canal into Keetham Lake
and from the lake back into the Yamuna. This arrangement will become per-
manent, and the project will include those works ne'ied to utilize the arran-
gement efficiently. Keetham is about 10 miles west of Agra and the city is
expanding in that direction, away from the existing int4ke. Unier the
project, a new intake will be built about 5 miles west of Agra with
associated pumping station, raw water main, treatment plant, and clear water
transmission main to the city.
14.     In all the project towns, the project would provide for distribution
mains, connections, consumers' meters, zonal meters, and production meters;
in some towns handpumps will also be provided.
Sewerage
15.     The main thrust of the program will be towards maximizing utilization
of existing sewerage networks, with emphasis on connecting properties to the
sewers. To achieve this, sewers in some cases wil have to be cleaned,
repaired or replaced to be compatible to flows to be carried. Up to 15,000
new connections are projected. To encourage households to connect, the
municipalities will lay that part of the house connection which lies within
the street, and in this way the burden on the householder will be reduced.
16.     The municipalities will use, to the extent possible, mechanical
joints for sewer construction and will review their standard specifications
for sewers and manholes. It is expected that the practice of using manholes
as polnts of connection will cease, and that future connections will be made
directly to the sewers. The project also includes procurement of sewer
cleaning equipment and mobile gully emptiers.
Solid Waste Mbnagement (SUM)
17.     In all towns, the 5101 service is the largest employer of labor and
transport and normally spends the largest proportion of the revenue budget,
but in no town is there a senior officer employed exclusively on SUK opera-
tions. In some towns the medical officer is nominally responsible, but only
at the third or fourth tier management level is there anyone engaged
full-time on SUM duties. In some of the larger towns the medical officer is
responsible for the labor-intensive street sweeping and primary collection
service; a section of the engineer's department providing and maintaining
the transport and employing the drivers and loaders. The present service
suffers as a result of divided control, and it becomes difficult to alter
working methods or systems in one department because of the effect it may
have on the other.
18.     Ideally, each town should have a separate conservancy or cleansing
department with its own administrative, financial, and technical support
staff, headed by a technical officer with SUM experience and directly respon-
sible to the administrator or executive officer for all aspects of SWU.



-82-                        ANNEX 5
Page 5 of 6
However, such a change would involve radical restructuring and may not be
supportable in the smaller towns.
19.     COUP has accepted the principle of centralized control and will issue
the necessary changes in the manner most appropriate to local conditions and
staff resources.  The designated officers will receive SWM training under the
training and technical assistance component, and the new management organiza-
tion will be built up from the existing structure by inter-departmental staff
transfers. In the largest town, Kanpur, the establishment of a centralized
SWM department was a covenanted requirement under KUDPT, and has been complied
with.
20.     The primary collection system will be improved by the provision of
simple low-cost indigenous equipment, such as improved design hand-carts and
tricycle or auto rickshaws for congested areas, transferring the wastes
collected to containers or feeder tipping vehicles, and eliminating, where
possible, the present roadside heaps. "Once only" handling will be achieved
by replicating the primary collection systems developed by All India
Institute of Hygiene and Public Health (AIIEPH) in the Calcutta Metropolitan
Area under a project partly financed by the Bank. The SWM sub-cell of IPMC
will initiate demonstration projects in selected project towns, adapting the
AIIHPH methodology to suit UP conditions. To cope with the increased tonnage
collected by improved service delivery, tipping vehicles of varying
capacities tailored to local needs will be provided.
21.     Existing maintenance and workshop facilities are generally poor and,
with one exception, no routine servicing of vehicles is carried out.  Exist-
ing workshops will be improved or new workshops provided in more convenient
locations for first line repair and servicing. Major repairs will continue
to be carried out by private sector garages. Where compaction type collec-
tion vehicles are being provided, the towns will enter into operation and
maintenance contracts with the supplier to ensure maximum vehicle
availability.
22.     Except in Kanpur, where an existing compost plant will shortly become
operational, all disposal of wastes will be by landfill. Where required,
all-weather roads will be constructed, operational methods improved, and
bulldozers and payloaders provided for spreading and leveling the wastes.
Maintenance
23.     Many investments to be made under this project in infrastructure and
equipment rehabilitation are necessitated by neglect of maintenance needs
which has resulted in significant backlogs of deferred maintenance in all
service sectors. Substantial amounts of unaccounted-for water in the dis-
tribution systems, deteriorated treatment works, clogged drains and sewers,
and defects in road pavements bear witness to the lack of proper maintenance
in the project cities. Insufficient maintenance not only results in prema-
ture needs for rehabilitation or replacement but also significantly affects
the cities' ability to sustain urban productivity and employment, and results
in increased costs to the users of urban roads and other infrastructure.



-83-

24.     A special study on maintenance management will be carried out in all
project cities by the operations and maintenance COIN) sub-cell which was
established under the IPMC to assist project cities in this area on a con-
tinuous.basis. IDA has provided draft terms of reference for this study.
25.     Utility mapping will be carried out in all project cities to estab-
lish necessary inventories and records of assets as a precondition for a
systematic maintenance effort.
26.     Lastly, priority items of vehicles and equipment as well as improve-
ments to municipal workshops and depots will be provided in all cities except
Aligarh and Chaziabad which, because of their proximity to New Delhi can
contract out equipment and intensive maintenance works to the many contrac-
tors located in the capital area.

ANNEX 10
Page 43of 47
Summary of Assumptions for Financial Projections
1.      Extended financial projections have been prepared for all the Group A
and Group 8 project towns covering the following entities or activities:
(a) For water supply and sanitation, the Jal Sansthans as implementing
agencies for water supply and sanitation components in Group A towns,
and for the water supply and sanitation activities of Nagar Palikas
(Municipal Bodies) in Group B towns.
(b) Municipal Bodies -- Nagar Mahapalikas in Group A towns and Nagar
Palikas in Group B towns.
(c) Development Authorities in those Group A and Group B towns where
there are project components which will be implemented by these
Authorities.
2.      The projections are for all fiscal years up to 1993/94.  Where
appropriate they are made from a base of actual data for fiscal years 1983/84
to 1985/86, or final estimates for 1985/86 where data were not yet available.
3.      All figures in the projections are expressed in Rs. L.akhs at current
prices using the following price escalation assumptions:
Year                             Price %
1986/87                                  -
1987188                                 6.8
1988189                                 6.8
1989/90                                 7.0
1990/91                                 7.1
1991/92                                 4.0
1992/93                                 4.0
1993/94                                 4.0
A. Water Supply and Sanitation
4.      Two separate projections have been prepared:
(a) Income and expenditure on a cash basis.
(b) Sources and applications of funds.
S.      Underlying each projection is an eight-year profile of project capi-
tal expenditures with the associated operation and maintenance cost implica-
tions and revenues. These are overlayed on the continuing operations of the
entities to provide a global performance projection. The project financing



-160-                        ANNu  10
Page 44 of 47
terms are for 20 year annuities at 8.75 percent, with a five year period of
grace for the repayment of principal.
Income and Expenditure
Operation and Maintenance and Other Expenses
6.      In the past, some towns were unable to meet out of their revenues all
their working expenses. Von-payment of electricity bills and interest char-
ges has been a common occurrence. The projections assume all expenses will
be met, except in Agra, Saharanpur and Chasiabad.
7.      Wherever possible expenses are broken down according to labor, power,
materials and other expenses and are shown for water supply and sanitation
separately. Interest charges and depreciation are also shown separately but
depreciation is invariably an unreliable estimate (see balance sheets,
below).
8.      In the past the levels of operation and maintenance expenditures
often have been inadequate for the tasks. Accordingly it would be in order
to project increases in the levels of 0 and 1 costs as a reflection of expen-
diture needs to achieve enhanced standards, as well as for the enlarged tasks
to be performed under the project. On the other hand, there is scope for
efficiency gains. Accordingly the projections of 0 and M costs are a com-
bination of these factors which are working in different directions. Under
the project, a Maintenance Study will be carried. One of its objectives will
be to identify the resources needed for appropriate levels of maintenance.
Revenues
9.      Revenues are receivables from consumers as water charges and as water
and sewer taxes (based on a percentage of the assessed value of properties).
Some towns are in the process of introducing a drainage tax in lieu of a
sewer tax where there are no sewer services. Between October 1985 and July
1986 all project towns introduced new tariffs and/or new tax rates, and are
undertaking property reassessments. There are also, other minor receivables.
These actions will have the consequence of significant upward movements in
revenues during 1986/87 and 1987/88 when compared with earlier years in all
towns, although the magnitudes of the increases will vary.
10.     A major concern in all towns is the magnitude of arrears.  Unpaid
bills cannot be written off under Government accounting rules so the true"
measure of arrears, in the sense of being receivables rather than bad debts,
is not known. Current demand appears at face value to be unduly large but
this is partly because discounts are offered by the entities for prompt
payment and for owner-occupier dwellings. Nevertheless, these matters cannot
conceal the fact that much more revenue can, and should, be collected. All
towns are taking active steps to reduce arrears through improved billings,
resort to the courts, adverse publicity, and so on. These actions will
gradually improve the revenue position of the entities over the project
period. Often the worst offenders are institutions such as the police, fire



-161-                         ANNEX 10
Page 45 of 47
service and hospitals where action to cut off supplies would be inap-
propriate.
11.     With their improving revenue achievements arising from the various
actions outlined above, project towns except Agra, Saharanpur and Ghaziabad
would be in a position tc meet at least their anticipated water supply and
sanitation operation and maintenance costs (i.e. working expenses) throughout
the whole of the project period. The three exceptions would meet their
working expenses as from the following datesS
Agra -         1989/90 onwards
Saharanpur -  1988/89 "      "
Chaziabad  -  1990/91 "      S
12.     An objective of COUP is for project towns to cover 100I   of their
operation and maintenance and debt service expense by 1993/94 (See Annex 4,
Attachment 1). A number of towns are able to do so earlier, and accordingly
earlier dates have been set for achieving this objective. The financial
projections include the following:
i) Assumptions
351 increase in water and sewer/drainage taxes in 1986/87 and
1991/92 in concert with the quinquennial assessment of urban
properties;
ii) Requirements

The above are "illustrative" since it might be possible to achieve the
desired result by different means, such as improved billing and collection of
current demand over projections, and improved collection of arrears.
Sources and Application of Funds
13.     Statements have been constructed from the Income and Expenditure
Statements project cost summaries to provide a projection of water supply and
sanitation funds flow. However, instances occur where, from the data at
hand, sources do not balance with applications. Where they are inadequate a
balancing item has been shown representing the amount needed to fund the
operations either out of reserves or by some external subvention.
14.     Changes in working capital requirements are assessed using changes in
one month's labor costs plus three month's materials.
Balance Sheets
15.     Balance sheets projections have not been included as fixed asset
values are unreliable due to inadequacies of existing assets registers which
provide, at best, only a guide to the true valuation and may be misleading.
During the project period all water supply and sanitation assets will be
surveyed and asset valuations will be updated. Project towns would then be
encouraged to produce projected balance sheets.
B. Municipal Bodies
16.     Income and expenditure projections have been prepared on a cash basis
for the Nagar Mahapalikas (Group A) and Nagar Palikas (Group B).
17.     Revenues are derived from general tax, octroi and various other taxes
and direct sources of income, and from COUP in the form of revenue grants.
During 1986/87 and 1987/88 there will be significant increases in own
revenues arising from the effects of reassessments of properties and some
changes to tax rates, including octroi. An approximately 35% increase in
general tax is projected in 1991/92 when the next quinquennial reassessment
of properties is due.
18.     Revenue grants are in part determined by formulae -- e.g. municipal
bodies receive 22 percent of their salaries expenditure as grants, and other-
wise at the discretion of COUP.
19.     Capital accounts consist, on the income side, of loans and capital
grants where the grants are at a rate of 50 percent of qualifying capital
expenditure for low cost sanitation and certain other items.

Page 47 of 47
20.     A COUP objective is for project towns to finance an increasing share
of its revenue expenditures from internally generated revenues (See Annex 4,
Attachment 2). This can be achieved by making assumptions on the increases
in the general tax (see para 17 above), other revenue enhancement measures
introduced/to be introduced by COUP (see para 6.08), improved collection of
current demand, and improved collections of arrears.
21.     All towns, except possibly Bareilly, are capable of financing their
respective investment programs. The program for Bareilly would be reviewed
in depth after one/two years implementation to determine whether, in the
light of their resource mobilization progress, the scale of their original
investment program should be reduced.
22.     General (property) tax is much underexploited (being governed by the
Rent Control Act), and efforts will be made as part of the project to
increase revenues from this source. OUJP, in consultation with GOI, would
prepare proposals by March 31, 1989 to eliminate rent control, or further
ease its negative effects, and implement mutually acceptable proposals in the
remaining project period (see para 6.08).
23.     In addition to the general improvement in their revenue base, all
bodies would continue to increase the quality of services provided and the
efficiency of service delivery. Achievement of this objective is difficult
to demonstrate in the tables although all bodies are capable of increasing
revenue expenditure over the project period.  As mentioned in paragraph 8 of
this Annex, a Maintenance Study, to be carried out under the project, would
help determine appropriate levels of revenue expenditure to ensure, inter
alia, improved service delivery.
C. Development Authorities
24.     Income and expenditure and balance sheet projections have been
prepared for all Development Authorities which are project implementing
entities. In all cases the project represents a small proportion of their
total investment program.
25.     The income and expenditure projections demonstrate that all the
Authorities can recoup through sales and leases their full costs including
debt service charges, at real rates of interest and after making allowance
for overheads and depreciation.

UTTAR PRADESH URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS ASSUMPTIONS - WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION
1.      An economic analysis has been performed on the water supply and
sanitation components of the project for each Group A and Group B town.
Detailed working papers are held in the project file.
2.      All costs are expressed in Rs lakhs at 1986 prices.  Capital expendi-
ture is phased over eight years and includes contingencies but not design,
supervision, and management. Operating and maintenance expenditure has been
derived incrementally from fiscal year 1986/87. After 1993/94, 0 and M costs
are assumed constant other than for labort which has been assumed to rise at
1 percent per annum to reflect general growth in real wages offset by produc-
tivity gains.
3.      Benefits have been measured by incremental revenues from 1986/87.
Revenues have been taken from all sources, including taxes, and are for water
supply and sanitation services combined. Revenues overstate benefits to the
extent that taxes are paid by some people who do not receive services, but
they understate the benefits, since prices have not limited demand to the
supplies available. Revenues also include some arrears, which may not
measure current benefits. On the other hand, current arrears are benefits
which are not measured by revenues, so these two effects are offsetting, to
some extent. Revenue projections include the substantial effects of tariff
and tax increases introduced in 1986/87, and the quinquennial reassessment of
properties in 1991/92. They also include adjustments to water charges as
outlined in Annex 10, Summary of Assumptions for Financial Projections. No
further revenue increases are incorporated other than a 0.5 percent per annum
general rise after 1993/94, which reflects an increase in the usage of
facilities and services by the project as towns grow.
4.      No formal assessment has been possible of health benefits and other
social benefits of the project other than those incorporated into revenues,
but they undoubtedly are important in the overall justification of the
project.
5.      Labor shadow prices have been assumed alternatively at 100 percent
and 70 percent of nominal wages. The labor content of capital expenditure
was assumed to be 50 percent. The labor content of 0 and M costs was
measured directly.

6.      The project life has been assumed at 40 years from the start of
construction in 1986/87.
7.      The economic rates of return for all towns, along with the net
present values of the net benefit streams at discount rates of 6 and 8 per-
cent, are as follows:
Labor         ERR           NPV at 6X         NPV at 8X
(Rs lakhs)        (Rs lakhs)
100l         10.2X          2,842                810
