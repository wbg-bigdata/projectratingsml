I.        STRATEGIC CONTEXT

     A.    Country Context

  1.    More than two years of violent conflict in Syria has resulted in massive movements of
people within Syria, as well as into neighboring countries. In early May 2013, almost 1.5 million
people had registered, or were awaiting registration with the UNHCR in Jordan, Lebanon,
Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. Of these, approximately 541,000 have crossed the border into Jordan –
with 240,000 having arrived in 2013 alone. Given the current rate of entry, and the Government
of Jordan’s (GOJ) commitment not to close the borders, the UNHCR is estimating that by the
end of 2013, the number of refugees in Jordan will surpass the 1 million mark, constituting more
than 16 percent of the population. Such increases in the number of refugees into Jordan are
threatening the country’s strong achievements in human development and poverty reduction. For
example, measles and polio – diseases that have been eliminated in Jordan for some years – have
reappeared in the past few months. With summer approaching, threats of major outbreaks of
diseases exist.

  2.   At the same time, Jordan experienced other large exogenous shocks over the past years
that have resulted in a sharp and unsustainable deterioration of its fiscal and external balances.
Jordan imports almost all of its input for electricity generation, mostly in the form of gas from
Egypt (contracted at preferential rates). Due to gas pipeline explosions, gas supplies from Egypt
have drastically shrunk in 2012 to 16 percent of contractual obligations. To meet its generation
needs, Jordan had to substitute cheap gas with expensive oil imports. This resulted in a drastic
and unsustainable widening of both the current account and the fiscal balance deficits. The
former reached a staggering 18 percent of GDP in 2012, up by 6 percentage points of GDP from
2011. The latter reached 16 percent of GDP (excluding arrears) in 2012 for the non-financial
public sector as losses from NEPCO, the national electricity company, surged to 5 percent of
GDP due to the gas supply disruption, and the central government’s deficit reached 10 percent of
GDP (excluding grants). Public debt dynamics rapidly deteriorated with gross public debt
soaring from 71 percent of GDP at end-2011 to 80 percent of GDP at end-2012. Faced with
mounting macroeconomic vulnerabilities, including a large deterioration in its foreign exchange
reserves, Jordan entered into an IMF Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) program in August 2012.
Given the magnitude of the vulnerabilities and financing needs of the country, the SBA required
exceptional access from the IMF.

  3.    To address pressures on its fiscal and external balances, in November 2012, the GOJ
eliminated entirely its large petroleum products subsidy program (with the exception of the LPG
program). With rising oil prices, the cost of subsidizing petroleum product prices became
unsustainably large, reaching about 3 percent of GDP in 2012. As a result, in November the GOJ
increased the price of petroleum products in one step so as to eliminate the subsidy. The resulting
price increases on gasoline (Octane-90), diesel and kerosene ranged from 14 to 33 percent.
Although subsidies on LPG cylinders used mainly for cooking were not fully removed, retail
prices were increased by 54 percent to reduce the subsidy cost. The GOJ also reinstated the
monthly automatic petroleum products price adjustment mechanism that existed until December
2010 to prevent the re-occurrence of subsidies over time. To compensate households for large
price increases on petroleum products, the GOJ simultaneously introduced a broad-based cash
transfer scheme, implemented by the Ministry of Finance (MOF).


                                                9
  4.     Rising macroeconomic vulnerabilities and tepid growth led to renewed increase in
already high unemployment. Growth reached 2.6 percent in 2012, far below the 6.6 percent
average growth rate achieved during 2000-2008. Headwinds in 2012 stemmed from the onset of
a large fiscal consolidation program, pressure on net exports due to trade disruptions linked to
the conflict in Syria, and the impact of a large increase in retail petroleum product prices on
private consumption as a result of the elimination of all petroleum subsidies (except for LPG as
described above). Given Jordan’s low employment elasticity to growth, the country’s already
high unemployment rate further deteriorated, from 12.5 percent at end-2012 to 12.8 percent in
the first quarter of 2013, with unemployment levels particularly high among women and youth.

  5.    The Syrian conflict has already impacted key economic sectors in Jordan and poses a
serious risk to growth. The accelerating influx of Syrian refugees materially increased pressure
on public service provision, worsened already stretched public finances, and is also having an
impact on Jordanians working in the informal labor market, both in terms of competition for jobs
and downward pressure on wages. Some Jordanians are marginally profiting from the increased
demand for commodities, rental accommodation and jobs. But a vast majority of communities -
particularly those in the north - are being squeezed by higher prices and lower wages. A decline
in exports following the closure of Syrian transit routes, combined with rising imports due to
Syrian refugee’s demand (e.g., food imports rose by about 20 percent in 2012), worsened
Jordan’s trade balance in 2012 and pressures are expected to continue in 2013. The continuing
conflict in Syria and the growing influx of refugees are exerting mounting inflationary pressures
on Jordan’s economy: inflation rate rose to 7.6 percent year-on-year in March 2013 as prices of
transport, vegetables, meat, poultry, and fruits rose by 10 to 27 percent year-on-year. While the
large refugee influx has somewhat helped sustain domestic demand through increased private
consumption, this could rapidly be overshadowed by the negative impact that the worsening
Syrian conflict could have on consumer and investor confidence (as has already occurred in
Lebanon). Overall, the conflict poses significant downside risks to growth in Jordan.

   B.    Situations of Urgent Need of Assistance

  6.    This project is being prepared and implemented according to paragraph 11 of the World
Bank Operational Policy 10.00, which allows for certain exceptions to the investment project
financing policy requirements if the Bank deems the borrower to be in urgent need of assistance
because of a man-made disaster or conflict (among other factors). The evolving situation in
Jordan reflects both the impact of conflict (in neighboring Syria) and of a man-made disaster
(resulting from the influx of refugees fleeing the conflict) – two of the specific situations that the
provisions were developed to address.

  7.    There are to date no indications that conditions in Syria will change in the foreseeable
future, and it is expected that the costs stemming from hosting Syrian refugees in Jordan will
continue to rise. As the influx of Syrians continues to increase, the capacity of the existing
infrastructure will no longer be sufficient to meet the excess demand, and urgent public
investments in the sectors that are under particular pressure, among them education, health water,
municipal waste, will be needed – imposing further and potentially substantial burdens on
Jordan’s already stretched public finances.

     C.      Sectoral and Institutional Context

  8.    While some of the Syrian refugees are living in camps, the large majority (estimated to be
as much as 70 percent of refugees) are living in Jordanian communities. In addition to its
commitment not to close its borders, the GOJ decided early on to allow Syrian refugees to access
public services (health facilities, schools) and subsidies extended to Jordanian citizens (energy,
water, bread and gas), hence putting pressure on delivery of services and public finances. The
immediate impact of the exponential increase in users over such a short time period has primarily
been met through existing structures such as double shifting in schools and an accelerated use
and hence depletion of Jordanian drugs and vaccination stocks. Given the unequal spatial
distribution of refugees in Jordan, crowding out of public services - such as MOH-run hospitals
and primary healthcare centers - has materially impacted access for Jordanians in communities
with large concentrations of Syrian refugees such as in the northern governorates. The GOJ has
calculated that it incurred additional costs in the order of US$250 million in 2012 and the first
quarter of 2013 to accommodate the increased demand for services. In health care, the MOH has
already spent US$53 million to cover the health care needs of the Syrian refugees. The latest
GOJ Response Plan (see below) estimates the cost of accommodating the Syrian refugees in
2013 at US$850 million.1

 9.     In spite of the significant impact felt by the Jordanian state and communities, the majority
of the international support has been channeled to the needs of the displaced Syrians. UN
agencies such as UNHCR and UNICEF, supported by donors, international NGOs and charities,
are catering to the needs of those residing in camps and cover some social services of those
outside. 2 Very little has been targeted to mitigate the impact of the influx of Syrians on
livelihoods and service delivery of Jordanians.



1
 The Government assessments and requests have not been based on a common methodology across agencies, and most of them
have found it difficult to produce accurate figures on the expenditures incurred due to the Syrian influx as they have been
absorbed to a large extent by the general budget. In addition, the extent to which some of the costs are recovered by external
donors also varies across sector reporting.
2
 Even so, it has been difficult to raise sufficient funds to cover these needs: the last UN appeal of US$500 million has been met
with a 50% response as of May 16, 2013.



                                                               11
 10. One of the key sectors that is facing pressures as a result of the influx of Syrian refugees
is the health sector. 3 Jordan’s health sector fares better than many countries in the MENA region.
It spends approximately 8.0 percent of the GDP on health, a figure considered high for a low-
middle income country. Health coverage is also widely available to most of the population (75
percent of the population have some form of health insurance). The largest insurer is the Civil
Health Insurance program (CIP/MOH), covering over 34 percent of the population, followed by
the Military Health Insurance program (RMS), covering 23 percent, UNRWA covering 9
percent, and the private insurance covering 8 percent. The remaining 25 percent of the
population who are without any health insurance are by law entitled to free care in MOH
facilities and when needed, are referred to non-MOH facilities for treatment.

 11. However, continuity and sustainability of health service delivery in Jordan is at risk of
being compromised, and past achievements in the sector are potentially threatened. The
healthcare needs of the Syrian refugees are naturally different than those of the settled
populations due to the different demographic mix, living conditions and vulnerabilities.
According to UNHCR data, 78 percent of the Syrian refugees are vulnerable, requiring
additional assistance. This includes women (49 percent), children under the age of 12 (40
percent), and elderly (2.1 percent). In addition, 23 percent of Syrian refugees have chronic
diseases or serious medical conditions that require medical follow up. Comparative morbidity
data show a different disease profile with increased levels of morbidity for Syrians refugees than
Jordanians which may affect the disease burden in the future. According to Jordan’s national
cancer statistics, Syrian refugees presenting with cancer at health facilities rose from 134 in 2011
to 169 in the first quarter of 2013, representing a 14 percent increase in Jordan’s total cancer
disease burden. Similarly, morbidity data from the MOH show a rise in selected communicable
diseases. For example, TB case notification increased from 5/100,000 in 2009 among Jordanians
to 13/100,000 among Syrian refugees in 2013. While no measles cases have been reported in
Jordan since 2009, MOH data show that 18 Jordanians and 23 Syrians have been diagnosed with
the disease in 2013. Polio, which had been eliminated since 1999 in Jordan, was also detected in
two cases in 2013. Demand for services by refugees at MOH facilities has increased
significantly. MOH data show that the number of outpatient visits to MOH primary health care
centers (PHCCs) by Syrian refugees increased from 68 in January 2012 to 15,975 in March
2013. Similarly and during the same period, Syrian refugees attending MOH hospitals increased
from 300 to 10,330; this was associated with a sharp increase in the number of surgeries
performed at these hospitals going from 105 to 622 surgeries

 12. With the higher demand for health services and the GOJ’s policy to provide refugees with
access to the country’s health care services, the health sector is facing significant financial
pressures and shortages, particularly in drugs and vaccines, as these are being depleted at a faster
rate. The response of health facilities has been to run down their emergency stocks. Between
2011 and 2012 drugs procured by the MOH increased by 15 percent at an additional cost of $14
million (18 percent increase). And between 2013 and 2014, drug costs are expected to increase
by 23 percent at an additional cost of around US$16 million. Financing some of the immediate

  The team also investigated the impact on the education sector but, for a variety of reasons, it estimated that the fiscal impact
was lower in magnitude than in the health sector, at least as of early 2013. These reasons include: (1) the room to absorb in
classrooms a large number of students at minimal marginal cost for the state given the low initial student-teacher ratio existing in
Jordan; and (2) the fact that some UN agencies and donors are directly financing some of these education costs for the Syrian
refugees (e.g., UNICEF/EU finances teachers and books needed in schools were double-shifting is occurring).


                                                                12
healthcare needs, mainly hospital referrals, drugs and vaccines will help alleviate the burden of
the Syrian crisis on affected communities, improve the fiscal ability of the MOH and assist the
GOJ in maintaining its commitment for timely access to health care to its citizens.

 13. Notwithstanding fiscal consolidation pressures, the GOJ is strongly committed to
protecting not only its poor citizens but also its lower middle class. One of the elements of its
poverty-reduction approach has been to provide access to basic household commodities for the
population, particularly bread and LPG household cylinders (used for cooking and space
heating). The bread and LPG cylinders programs are simple in their design and enable all
households living in Jordan to access basic necessities, as these are universal untargeted
programs. Both programs are on-budget, as opposed to subsidies on water or electricity so the
link between increased consumer demand and the GOJ budget is clearer. For 2012, spending on
these two programs reached 1.6 percent of GDP. With respect to the bread subsidy program, the
GOJ subsidizes wheat but also sets the price of bread at the bakery level. The price is established
with a view to (i) keeping the price of the subsidized bread constant at the bakery level; and (ii)
maintaining a given profit margin for mills. Mills transform the wheat into flour and sell to
bakeries that, in turn, sell the subsidized bread at a regulated retail price of JD0.16/kg, a price
that has been unchanged since 1996. With respect to LPG cylinders, the program is a direct
subsidy scheme administered by the MOF and implemented by the Jordan Petroleum Refinery
Company (JPRC). Through its LPG cylinder factory, the JPRC sells two types of LPG cylinders
in Jordan: a 12.5kg cylinder, the price of which is subsidized and regulated by the Government,
and which is aimed at households for home cooking and also space heating. The other cylinder
produced is a commercial 50kg cylinder, which is not aimed at households and is not subsidized.

 14. Bread and LPG products are progressive and relatively heavily consumed products for
Jordanian households. Poorer households spend a larger share of their total expenditure on bread
and LPG (World Bank, 2009, 2011). 4 They account for about 7 percent of poor households’ total
consumption compared to only 2 percent of the richest Jordanian households. More specifically,
Jordanian households in the bottom decile spend 3.6 percent of their expenditures on subsidized
food items, whereas for the richest 3 deciles that share falls to below 1 percent. Similarly, the
poorest 20 percent Jordanian households spend 2.3 percent of their total spending on LPG
compared to 1 percent for the richest 20 percent households (World Bank, 2012). 5 Simulations
show that non-availability of bread and LPG at their current subsidized prices would notably
increase poverty in Jordan, whereby 45,000 people could be pushed into poverty (if prices for
wheat and LPG increased by 35 and 15 percent, respectively). Non-availability of bread at their
current subsidized price could also result in significant social instability, as past bread riots that
resulted from the increase in price of the subsidized bread demonstrated (Lamis and Schwedler,
1996). 6 Given their universal/untargeted nature, both the bread and LPG subsidies, however,
suffer from leakage to better off consumers, including consumers in other countries due to

potential for smuggling activity, especially given supply disruptions in the provision of basic
goods such as bread and LPG that is taking place in Syria. As recommended in the above-
mentioned World Bank studies, the efficiency of these subsidy programs could be significantly
improved over time.

 15. The GOJ has maintained its subsidy policy during the period of large influx of Syrian
refugees, and therefore has had to incur significant pressure on its budget. Between 2010 and
2012, bread subsidies rose from JD103 million to JD225 million. Similarly, the LPG subsidy
increased from JD70 million to JD127 million. Analysis shows that the presence of large
numbers of Syrian refugees has been behind the significant and material increase in demand for
subsidized bread in Jordan and that the marked change in consumption trend is well explained by
the influx of Syrian refugees and the price gap (see Economic Analysis and Annex 2 for details).

    D.    Higher Level Objectives to which the Project Contributes

 16. The overarching strategic objective of the World Bank Group’s Jordan Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2012-2015 is building resilience to internal and external shocks
through laying a foundation for inclusive growth and job creation. 7 This strategic approach
proves to be relevant in the current context. While it could not foresee the Syrian crisis and its
impact on Jordan, the CPS acknowledged that Jordan is vulnerable within a highly volatile
region and is clearly exposed to risks stemming from the regional environment. The strategic
framework of the CPS was formulated in a flexible manner to allow for needed adjustments
including additional operations in response to GOJ’s demand. One key pillar identified in the
CPS to help mitigate risks, and to which the proposed emergency project speaks, is enhancing
inclusion through social protection and local development. Under this pillar, the CPS places
enhancement of inclusion and improvement of living standards of the population at the center of
the strategy, with social protection and local development as one of the means for reducing
regional imbalances. Jordanian households, in particular in the hosting communities, are
struggling to maintain living standards under the current stress. The proposed operation therefore
supports the basic needs of Jordanian households (through financing bread and household gas
subsidies). As the Syrian conflict will clearly impact development achievements in already
vulnerable areas, the operation, in alignment with the CPS, addresses poverty, as well as human
development services to vulnerable groups.

 17. When the Syrian refugee issue surfaced, the World Bank stepped in to support the GOJ
through a State and Peace-building Fund Grant (SPF) of US$1.2 million to support a pilot
livelihood program, as well as to undertake a fiscal impact study. In addition, the Bank has been
the recipient of a US$4 million grant from Canadian CIDA to support livelihoods in affected
communities. Recognizing the fast evolving situation, the Bank is stepping up its support. This
project is thus part of a larger program of support that would aim to help Jordan build up
resilience to the current and future impacts of conflict spillover, and pursue its reform programs.
In addition to this emergency operation, the package would include a DPL that addresses
medium-term structural reforms, and investments directed specifically at the most affected cities
and towns to provide capacity building and institutional support to hosting communities and key

central and local institutions. The Bank will seek to attract additional donor resources –
particularly in the form of grants and specifically for the mitigation of the impact of the crisis on
Jordanian citizens.

 18. Support for fragile and conflict-affected states is a key priority for the World Bank
Group. The World Development Report (WDR) 2011 on Conflict, Security and Development
considers four tracks to improve global responses for security and development: preventing
repeated cycles of violence; reforming internal agency systems to restore confidence and long-
term institution building; acting regionally and globally on external stresses; and marshaling
experience and support from global and regional institutions to reflect the changing landscape of
international policy and assistance. The proposed project, which will form a significant part of a
package of Bank support to Jordan to address the challenges of Syrian conflict, fits within this
framework. It not only aims to respond rapidly to address the urgent needs of the affected
populations, but also ensure that Jordan’s hard earned development gains in sectors like health
are not compromised by the current conflict.

II. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES

   A.    PDO

 19. The project objective is to help the Government of Jordan maintain access to essential
healthcare services and basic household needs for the Jordanian population affected by the large
and increasing influx of Syrian refugees.

   Project Beneficiaries

20.     The project beneficiaries consist of the following:

           •   Jordanian children between ages 0-6 years: Children between ages 0-6 years will
               receive vaccinations, which will prevent and control transmission of vaccine
               preventable diseases.

           •   Jordanian households particularly of the poor and lower-middle classes: The
               Jordanian population as a whole will benefit from the project through the
               continuation of the basic food (bread) and fuel (LPG) subsidies, as well as the
               medicines financed under the project. During the one-year implementation of this
               project, women, who constitute 48.6% of the population, will continue to benefit
               from the universality of the subsidies and medicines. In addition, poor and lower-
               middle class households will particularly benefit as they would be
               disproportionately impacted if universal access to these goods and services was
               interrupted.

           •   Jordanian patients: The project will benefit approximately 2500 Jordanian
               patients, particularly those living in the north, to continue to have access to health
               services.




                                                 15
             •    Health facilities: The project will provide health facilities with the needed drugs
                  and vaccines to ensure the stocks are available.

PDO Level Results Indicators

 21. Progress towards the PDO will be monitored through the following key indicators (see
Annex 1 for further details):

    1. Direct project beneficiaries (number), of which women (%) (Core indicator). This
       indicator will track the total beneficiaries of the immunization program, and inpatient
       and outpatient medical treatment.
    2. Children immunized (%) (Core indicator). This indicator will track the percentage of
       children immunized over the project period.
    3. Beneficiaries of social safety net program – subsidies (number), of which women (Core
       indicator). This indicator will track the total beneficiaries of the bread and LPG cylinder
       subsidy.
    4. Overall outpatient and inpatient utilization rates (%) at health facilities remain at or above
       baseline value. This indicator will measure the increase in the rate of utilization at the
       health facilities in the governorates most affected by Syrian refugees.

III. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

 22. The project consists of the following three components: (i) maintaining access to
essential healthcare services; (ii) supporting basic household needs; and (iii) project monitoring,
auditing, and verification. The selection of healthcare services and basic household needs was
based on the following criteria, considerations and constraints:

         (a)      Finance existing programs and those ready for implementation: this is motivated
         by: (i) the urgency of the situation, (ii) the tight fiscal constraint that the country is under
         given its commitments to the IMF as part of its Stand-By Arrangement program, and (iii)
         the need for rapid delivery and disbursement. As a result, the project is not increasing
         expenditures beyond those already included in the 2013 budget. Nor is it, therefore,
         affecting the budget deficit of the Government and its total public debt (whereas public
         debt is unchanged, the composition of the debt is affected, with World Bank financing
         replacing more expensive issuances, such as Treasury bonds). 8

         (b)     Protect poor and vulnerable lower middle class households from the impact of the
         crisis and rapid results: Shocks stemming from crisis situations can generate long-lasting
         impacts. Preventing or minimizing these short-term shocks from occurring can therefore
         generate substantial individual and social welfare gains, as well as long-term economic
         gains. Examples of such “hysteresis effects? include health where prolonged malnutrition
         or lack of vaccination during a crisis can lead to long-term effects (e.g. stunting,
         epidemics).

8
  Since the total debt stock of the country is not affected by this Project, the debt sustainability profile of Jordan is
also not impacted (though, at the margin, if the project is substituting domestic debt with foreign debt, the exposure
to foreign exchange shocks and pressure would be increased).


                                                          16
        (c)    Material impact: identify basic/key needs that are negatively and materially
        impacted by a large influx of refugees.

        (d)    Donor complementarity: focus on areas that are not currently addressed by the
        donor community.

        (e)      Simple and self-targeted: design a simple and, if possible, self-targeted operation
        so as to increase its effectiveness in reaching Jordanians most impacted by the crisis and
        facilitate monitoring.

        (f)     Self-winding operation: given Jordan’s large fiscal consolidation efforts, a key
        design consideration for the operation is that it does not generate additional fiscal costs
        for the budget beyond the temporary shock created by the Syrian conflict and the large
        influx of refugees.

 23. The project will be implemented over 12 months given the urgent needs. It includes
provision for retroactive financing of up to US$60 million (40 percent of loan amount) for
expenditures (identified under the project) incurred 12 months prior to loan signing. While
indicative allocations were agreed upon during project appraisal for Components 1 and 2, the
project is designed to accommodate changes in needs during implementation. Disbursements will
be made either based on a positive list (agreed upon during appraisal to be the Rational Drug List
- see Annex 3) or transaction based.

   A.    Project Components

 Component 1: Maintaining Access to Essential Healthcare Services (US$70 million)

 24. This component aims to sustain the provision of essential healthcare services to the
Jordanian population which is at risk due to the stress on resources resulting from the large influx
of Syrian refugees. This will be achieved by financing needed vaccines and drugs, and the
treatment of Jordanians that are being crowded out from public hospitals as a result of the
increasing use of public services by Syrian refugees.

   •    Provision of vaccines and essential drugs to ensure their adequate and continuous supply
        at all public healthcare facilities (US$50 million). In particular, the sub-component will
        finance vaccines and drugs procured by the Joint Procurement Department (JPD) from
        the Rational Drug List (see Annex 3) in a manner that satisfies the considerations of
        economy and efficiency. The project will finance a total of US$50 million of drugs and
        vaccines, including costs of drugs and vaccines procured and paid from June 30, 2012 to
        June 30, 2013, retroactively, and expected to be procured and paid from July 1, 2013 to
        June 30, 2014.

   •    Financing of healthcare services for Jordanians in non-MOH health facilities (US$20
        million). This sub-component aims to mitigate the financial impact of referring Jordanian
        patients to non-MOH hospitals and health facilities as a result of the increased demand
        for public facilities by Syrian refugees. As Jordanian law entitles all citizens to free


                                                17
       public health services, referrals from crowded public facilities to the non-MOH hospitals
       and health facilities have been undertaken by the MOH to ensure access to healthcare
       services for Jordanians, thus incurring higher costs. Specifically, the project will finance
       the costs of healthcare for approximately 2,500 Jordanian patients who MOH will need to
       refer to non-MOH hospitals and health facilities, based on criteria agreed upon with the
       MOH (see Annex 2). This will help alleviate the burden of the Syrian crisis on affected
       communities, improve the fiscal ability of the MOH to reimburse the non-MOH hospitals
       and health facilities for its services, and assist the MOH maintain its commitment for
       timely access to health care to its citizens

 Component 2: Supporting Household Basic Needs (US$79.9 million)

 25. Financing universal subsidies for household basic needs. The objective of this
component is to help the GOJ ensure the uninterrupted supply of basic household commodities
for poor and lower middle class households. The two subsidized products financed under this
component are bread (wheat) and LPG cylinders.

       •   Bread (US$55 million): The project will finance part of the increase in the cost of the
           bread subsidies worth US$55 million which is the estimated cost—based on a
           regression analysis—arising from the Syrian conflict and the associated increase in
           bread demand (see Annex 2 for details). Specifically, the component will finance the
           subsidy cost of 77,773 metric tons of flour for the retroactive period from July 2012-
           June 2013, and an estimated 64,811 metric tons of flour for the period July 2013-June
           2014. The average subsidy cost per metric ton of flour is estimated at US$385.7 based
           on historical cost from July 2012-May 2013.

       •   LPG Cylinders (US$25 million): For the LPG cylinders, which are mostly used by
           households for cooking and space heating, the project will finance the increase in the
           cost US$25 million worth of LPG subsidies which is the estimated cost arising from
           the Syrian conflict and the associated increase in LPG demand (see Annex 2 for
           details). Specifically, the component will finance the subsidy cost of 1.8 million
           standard (12.5kg) LPG cylinders for the retroactive period (June 2012-June 2013),
           and an estimated 3.2 million cylinders for the period July 2013-June 2014. The
           average subsidy cost per LPG cylinder is estimated at US$4.97 based on historical
           cost from June-December 2012 (latest data available).

 26. For both parts of Component 2, the project finances goods and services that are
universally provided. It is precisely because of this universal access that the Syrian crisis and the
large influx of Syrian refugees is increasing demand for these goods and services and therefore
adding fiscal pressures. These goods, however, are progressive in the sense that they constitute a
larger share of poor households’ expenditure than that of rich households. The continuation of
the supply of these universal goods and services is therefore aimed to help poor and lower
middle class households.




                                                 18
    Component 3: Project Monitoring, Auditing and Verification (US$100,000)

     27. This component will finance: (i) the costs of two special purpose audits (see below) as
    required for Component 1; and (ii) the cost of an external auditor, acceptable to the World Bank,
    who will be appointed to audit the project financial statements covering the Project’s 12 months
    lifetime and for both Components 1 and 2.

     28. For Component 1, an audit firm will be contracted within three months of effectiveness to
    perform an audit of the funds disbursed under retroactive financing for vaccines and drugs. The
    auditor will issue a special opinion on supporting documents related to the Rational Drug List
    and the Designated Account (DA) to be established in the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) to
    deposit the loan proceeds. Also, a consultancy firm will be contracted to perform a technical and
    financial verification of the list of medical bills of patients who will be referred to the non-MOH
    hospitals and health facilities before being further processed for payment by MOF.

        B.    Project Financing

        Financing Instrument

     29. The financing instrument is an Investment Project Financing for the amount of US$150
    million, to be financed through an IBRD loan. The Borrower has requested a Variable Spread
    Loan (VSL), linked to commitment with a 25 year maturity including a 4.5-year grace period.
    The Front-end Fee equal to one quarter of one percent (0.25%) of the Loan amount would be
    financed out of the loan proceeds.

        C.    Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design

     31. In emergency situations, temporary support to help meet essential household needs are
    pro-poor interventions that can help mitigate the potential for social instability. While the
    economic case for subsidies in normal circumstances is not compelling, this approach can be
    considered “best fit? in the current circumstances (as recommended in the WDR 2011) and can
    play an important temporary role in an emergency. In addition, both bread and LPG subsidies are
    considered pro-poor in that, while the non-needy benefit from a universal subsidy, the needy
    receive an equal share of the subsidy that in terms of relative income is more helpful in
    maintaining consumption.

     32. Reliance on existing structures and tested implementation approaches during a crisis
    facilitates a rapid and effective response. Evaluation of the World Bank’s experience in
    responding to the global financial crisis indicates that, in the interest of providing timely
    assistance, 74 percent of responses were channeled through existing programs. In the case of this
    operation, the project will rely on the MOF as the main implementing agency (see Section IV.
    A), which has experience with implementation of large cash transfer programs. In addition, the
    project will use existing national systems of the Joint Procurement Department (JPD), which has
    proven experience in large-scale procurement of drugs and vaccines for the Kingdom.

     33. Effective implementation requires intensive and sustained World Bank support.
    Experience from rapid responses undertaken in the context of the global financial crisis
    emphasizes the importance of sustained implementation support from the World Bank. Similar
    operations in the DRC and Ethiopia needed careful implementation support to introduce project
    modifications and to resolve unanticipated issues (e.g. those relating to verification of payments
    and eligibility of expenditures). In Jordan, the World Bank’s existing working relationship with
    the Ministry of Finance is expected to permit the necessary intensive and sustained technical and
    fiduciary implementation support. In addition, the World Bank Team expects to provide
    intensive and frequent implementation support throughout the project drawing on multi-sectorial
    staff based in Amman and the Lebanon Country Office.

     34. The inherent flexibility of newly introduced OP10.00 helped expedite preparation and the
    World Bank’s overall ability to respond to this situation of urgent need. This operation was the
    first in the MNA region (and the first Bank-wide) to apply OP10.00, paragraph 11 (Projects in
    Situations of Urgent Need of Assistance or Capacity Constraints) and under condensed
    procedures. As noted in the WDR 2011, the imperative to respond quickly in fragile situations
    places a “particular premium on speed? in an overall attempt to build confidence in the state’s
    ability to respond to challenging circumstances. The project has been specifically designed to
    minimize the need for time-intensive procurement, make use of the country system to the degree
    possible, and to make use of the higher proportion of retroactive financing permitted under
    OP10.00. The additional flexibility permitted under these provisions and streamlined processing
    enabled the World Bank to pivot effectively in responding to GOJ’s request for assistance.


                                                   20
IV. IMPLEMENTATION

   A.    Institutional and Implementation Arrangements

 35. The project will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) who will implement
the project through its regular budget implementation and monitoring mechanisms. Hence, there
will be no separate project implementation/management unit established. Implementation of the
project is primarily related to the management of bills, payments, and verifications/audits. Such
transactions are part of MOF’s function, and therefore it is logical that it be the implementing
agency. In addition, MOF manages the budget for the subsidies program, which is more than half
of the project, and they are implementing the large cash transfer program for subsidy
compensation, which requires a large amount of budget handling, systems, and payments.
However, in light of the fact that MOF has limited experience with the World Bank financial
management and disbursement guidelines, training will be provided to a qualified accountant
that will be appointed by MOF from its staff who will follow up on the financial management
and disbursement aspects of the project. In addition, the project will finance the following
additional support for MOF: (i) hiring an audit firm to verify retroactive expenditures on
vaccines and drugs; (ii) hiring an audit firm to perform the annual audit on the project (could be
same firm); (iii) hiring a consulting firm from the project funds to perform a technical and
financial verification of medical bills for patients referred to the non-MOH health facilities.

 36. With respect to the procurement of drugs and vaccines, the project will rely on Jordan’s
existing system for procurement through the Joint Procurement Department (JPD). The JPD is
the central organization in Jordan responsible for procurement of most of the pharmaceuticals
needs in the Kingdom in the public sector (see Annex 3 for additional information on the JPD).
The JPD, which began operations in 2004, based on by-law No. 91 of 2002 - Medicines and
Medical Supplies – conducts the procurement of pharmaceutical/medical goods in a transparent,
well organised and sound manner.

   B.    Results Monitoring and Verification

 37. The monitoring and verification of project results will be based on the financial
management and verification system. MOF will coordinate reporting on the project indicators
which will be generated from the payments and invoices incurred for vaccines, drugs, medical
treatment, bread and LPG subsidies. The MOF, the MOH, and the MOIT will provide the
requisite baseline data from which to measure outcomes by the end of the project. MOF will
establish a technical group/monitoring committee to ensure the achievement of the agreed
results.

 38. Specifically, there are two key monitoring aspects in this project: (i) monitoring of the
retroactive payments incurred for the goods and services already delivered; and (ii) monitoring
and verification of payments for the bills for goods and services to be procured prospectively.
For the retroactive payments, the audit firm and the technical firm will verify the supporting
documents related to the goods and services (vaccines and drug lists, and subsidies). For the
prospective payments, the bills for goods and services submitted to MOF will be tracked to
monitor the results, and measured against the baseline set up in the results framework.


                                               21
    C.    Sustainability

 39. The project is designed such that the bread and gas supports automatically wind down
when the crisis needs that they are addressing disappear. The intervention has been specifically
designed to avoid placing further fiscal stress on the Government – either in the immediate term
or, by affecting prices, create a future expectation that the level of support would be sustained
after the crisis has subsided. Broad-based and untargeted subsidies have well known drawbacks,
such as leakage to the non-poor and therefore a relatively high fiscal cost. This is also the case in
Jordan. The current operation, however, is designed to addresses the latter issue over the short-
term. By providing support only to incremental volumes of bread and gas consumed beyond the
level reached immediately prior to the onset of the Syrian conflict, the operation would not lead
to a permanent increase in subsidies in Jordan. It is designed to address a temporary shock. The
structural fiscal balance of the Government—which is the fiscal balance remaining once the
impact of cyclical and one-off shocks on both revenue and expenditures have been eliminated—
is therefore unaffected by the project. The project, therefore, does not impact the GoJ’s ongoing
and medium-term domestic and international commitments to fiscal consolidation. Over the
medium-term, however, the GOJ is committed to refine its petroleum subsidy cash transfer
program by developing a unified registry and improving the targeting of the program 9. Given
this commitment to targeting, it is expected that the GOJ will able be able to improve the
efficiency of the current universal bread and gas programs. This would significantly strengthen
the sustainability of these programs.

     B.   Overall Risk Rating Explanation

  40. The overall risk for this operation is rated “High? stemming primarily from the financing
 of the cost of medical treatments for Jordanian patients under Component 1, where such referral
 systems normally require significant controls and monitoring to ensure the appropriate patients
 are referred, referrals are directed to the right facilities, and that costs are controlled. The project
 design includes substantive financial management and control procedures, including for the
 medical treatments sub-component. Ample training on the World Bank financial management
 and disbursement guidelines will also be provided to the Borrower’s Ministry of Finance staff
 implementing the project in order to mitigate implementation risks. Additionally, the Bank will
 provide close implementation support to the Jordanian authorities, particularly in early stages of
 project implementation. With regard to social aspects, the project is primarily designed to
 reduce social tensions and pressure from the population as they see Government is committed to
 continue the availability of basic services for its citizens even in the face of mounting pressure
 from Syrian refugees. The measures noted earlier, together with strong Borrower ownership and
 interest in this operation will help mitigate against the key operational risks.

VI. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

     A.   Economic and Technical Analysis

 41. Economic analysis indicates that financing of US$80 million worth of supply of basic
goods at their current price would prevent both the incidence of poverty and its depth from
worsening. Simulations based on the SUBSIM model (Abdelkrim and Verme, 2012 10) show that
the proposed US$55 (US$25) million in financing for the wheat (LPG) program would prevent
prices of wheat (LPG) from rising by 35 (15) percent. Such price increases would, in turn, push
about 45,000 people into poverty, which represents a 5 percent increase in the number of the
poor in Jordan. Keeping the prices stable would also prevent the existing 14.4 percent (almost 1
million people) of the Jordanian population that is already in poverty from becoming even
poorer. As a comparison, when the GOJ eliminated all petroleum product price subsidies (except
LPG) in November 2012, the increase in petroleum product prices that resulted would have
pushed a similar magnitude of Jordanians into poverty (i.e., 53,000). To prevent such a dramatic
impact on poor and vulnerable households, the GOJ accompanied the subsidy phase out with a
broad-based cash transfer program of about US$420 million per year.

 42. The economic benefit from maintaining access to essential healthcare services, and in
particular drugs (medicines, vaccines) and medical treatments is significant. Disruption to access
of such services could have severe and lasting impacts both in terms of health outcomes and
fiscal cost for the budget that would be commensurately larger than the short-term cost of
ensuring continuous access. For instance, disruptions of vaccine supplies could lead to outbreaks
of diseases or even epidemics. Such concerns are real and present in Jordan at the time of project
design: while measles and polio had not occurred in Jordan in the past several years - as a result
the World Health Organization was in the process of certifying that Jordan had eradicated these
diseases prior to the influx of Syrian refugees - outbreaks of each of these diseases have recently

occurred. Immunizations are among the most cost effective activities provided by government in
the time of crisis without additional financial burden to families. Poor and lower middle class
Jordanian households would likely be disproportionately impacted by the situation as (1) they
cannot afford to access healthcare services outside MOH facilities, and (2) would be more at risk
of being infected by outbreaks of diseases.

     B.    Financial Management

 43. Due to the emergency nature of this operation and the need to respond quickly, the
financial management approach was streamlined and based on more simplified ex-ante
requirements, while relying more heavily on ex-post requirements as additional fiduciary
controls and review. The risk mitigation measures were designed to suit the available capacity
during implementation. The World Bank updated the assessment of the financial management
systems within MOF that was previously conducted during the preparation of the “Support to
Implementation of a National Unified Registry and Outreach Program for Targeting Social
Assistance Project?. 11 The assessment concluded that, with the implementation of agreed-upon
actions, the proposed FM arrangements will satisfy the minimum requirements under OP/BP
10.00. Furthermore, the Bank examined the inventory management system at the Directorate of
Purchases and Supplies/Ministry of Health (MOH) to ensure that reasonable assurance exists to
safeguarding the vaccines and drugs and collection by beneficiary hospitals and health centers.
Annex 3 provides additional information on the FM assessment and the recommended mitigation
measures.

 44. The Project financial management and disbursement functions will be managed by the
Finance Department at MOF. A qualified accountant will be identified from MOF’s Finance
Department to follow up on the financial management and disbursement aspects. In addition, a
Coordination Officer will be designated from Joint Procurement Department (JPD) who will be
in close coordination with the MOF accountant and will be responsible for providing MOF with
the necessary information and documentation. The MOF has limited experience and knowledge
with the World Bank financial management and disbursement guidelines. Therefore, adequate
training will be provided to Accountant in order to ensure full understanding and application of
the World Bank financial management and disbursement Policies and Procedures.

 45. To ensure that funds are readily available for project implementation, a Designated
Account (DA) will be opened at the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ). The DA will have a ceiling of
$60,000,000 and will be managed by MOF.

 46. Retroactive financing of up to US$60 million, equivalent to 40 percent of the Loan
amount, would be provided to finance US$21 million under Component 1 (vaccines and drugs)
and US$39 million under Component 2 (bread and LPG cylinders) for payments made before
Loan signing date, but on or after June 30, 2012. Such items are procured using acceptable
procurement procedures (as defined in Annex 3; Procurement Section). Funds under retroactive
financing will be transferred to the Government Unified Treasury in local currency. The

supporting documentation needed for submission under retroactive financing of each component
is defined below.

 47. For Component 1, the loan proceeds will finance the purchase of vaccinations and drugs
based on the Rational Drug List of products. The World Bank assessed the inventory
management system at the Directorate of Purchases and Supplies (MOH) in order to have a
reasonable assurance about the safeguard and storage of the project’s drugs until collection by
beneficiary hospitals and health centers. The assessment concluded that the inventory
management system at the Directorate of Purchases and Supplies (MOH) is adequate to
safeguard the drugs and collection by beneficiary hospitals and health centers. Retroactive
financing would be provided for vaccines and drugs purchased and paid during period from June
30, 2012 to June 30, 2013 against submitted Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). To avoid
excessive transaction costs, the minimum amount for direct payment and reimbursement would
be set at 20% of the Designated Account ceiling amount along with necessary supporting
documents. After funds being disbursed under retroactive financing for vaccinations and drugs,
an audit firm will be contracted within three months of effectiveness to perform audits. The
auditor will issue special opinions on drugs being procured and paid as per the Rational Drug
List, the corresponding stocks registers, and inventory controls in the assigned warehouses. For
vaccines and drugs procured and paid by JPD after June 30, 2013, disbursements will be made
from the DA and replenishments will be against SOEs. The same requirements of retroactive
financing related to minimum value of contracts to be submitted to the Bank and full supporting
documents will apply as well for prospective purchases after June 30, 2013. In addition, the final
project audit will include an audit (same scope as the retroactive financing audit) on the
prospective payments.

 48. In addition, for Component 1, the Project will finance the cost of referring Jordanian
patients to non-MOH hospitals and health facilities as a result of the increased demand for public
facilities by Syrian refugees. Due to the expected high volume of claims and the limited staff
capacity of MOF, a consultancy firm will be contracted to perform technical (medical) and
financial audit of medical bills of patients referred to the non-MOH hospitals and health facilities
before processed for payment by MOF. The work scope of the consultancy firm will be specified
in the TORs, acceptable to the Bank, and will include and not limited to: (i) verifying that
referrals are issued in accordance with MOH procedures; (ii) ensure appropriateness of referrals
and use of service according to health needs; and (iii) reasonableness of medical bills of the non-
MOH hospitals and health facilities. The TORs will be prepared by MOF and cleared by the
Bank. No retroactive financing is provided for this activity. Disbursements will be made from the
DA and replenishments will be against SOEs with appropriate certification of payments by the
consultancy firm.

 49. For Component 2, loan proceeds will finance the increase in the cost of the bread and
LPG cylinder subsidies due to the crisis. Retroactive financing would be provided for the bread
and LPG subsidies during period from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013 against submitted SOEs
that are reviewed and approved by the World Bank task team. In order to finance retroactively
bread and LPG subsidies, the following audit reports with audited financial statements and
quarterly review report are needed for submission to the Bank:




                                                25
              i)     The “Special Trade Account? of the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) for
              the year ended December 31, 2012; and
              ii)    The Petroleum Refinery Company (JPRC) for the year ended December 31, 2012
              and the quarterly review reports of March 31, 2013.

     50. MoIT “Special Trade Account? is solely used to record all financial transactions related
    for the basic food supplies, including bread. This account is annually audited by an independent
    audit firm hired by MoIT. The JPRC financial statements are annually audited by an external
    audit firm hired by JPRC. MOF should confirm the subsidy balances for bread and LPG’ as
    reported in audited financial statements of the year ended December 31, 2012 and quarterly
    report of March 30, 2013.

     51. For financing part of the increase in the cost of the bread and LPG cylinder subsidies
    after June 30, 2013, disbursements will be made from the DA based on the monthly reports on
    bread and LPG subsidies submitted by the MoIT and JPR verified and approved by MOF. The
    reports detail the monthly sales volume and will include the increase in sales volume due to the
    crisis, costs per unit, and subsidy amount at the end of each month. Replenishments will be
    against SOEs reviewed and approved by the World Bank task team, who will review the monthly
    reports for the increased cost of bread and LPG.

 53. MOF will be required to generate quarterly Interim un-audited financial reports (IFRs)
and submit to the Bank by no later than 45 days after the end of each quarter. An external
auditor, acceptable to the World Bank, will be appointed based on Terms of Reference (TORs)
acceptable to the Bank to Audit the project financial statements covering the Project’s 12 months
lifetime. The Project’s audited financial statements are due for submission to the World Bank no
later than three months after the end of the twelve months project implementation period. In
addition to the Project’s financial statements audit, special purpose audits are required for
component one. As detailed earlier, an audit firm will be contracted within three months of
effectiveness to perform audit of the funds disbursed under retroactive financing for vaccines and
drugs. Furthermore, a consultancy firm will be contracted to perform technical (medical) and
financial audit of the list of medical bills of patients referred to the non-MOH hospitals and
health facilities before being processed for payment by MOF.

   C.    Procurement

 54. Given the prevailing impact of the Syrian conflict on Jordan, this project is being
prepared and implemented according to paragraph 11 of the World Bank Operational Policy
10.00, where sub-paragraph 11(b) mentions “Such Projects may be processed under special
procurement arrangements referred to in paragraph 20 of OP 11.00 and may finance a positive
list of goods procured in a manner that satisfies the considerations of economy and efficiency
(including national procurement procedures of the borrower).?, procurement is being processed
under paragraph 20 of OP 11 “Procurement under Situations of Urgent Need of Assistance or
Capacity Constraints?, where “Simplified Procurement Procedures? may apply. Procurement
activities of this project are limited to vaccines/pharmaceutical goods under Component 1, and
consultant services (audits) under Component 3.

 55. Assessments and reviews conducted on procurement of medical goods in Jordan show
that the “Joint Procurement Department? (JPD) is successfully running annual procedures of
drug procurement on behalf of its partner institutions in Jordan, based on a Rational Drug List


                                                          27
that is updated from time to time as needed. The JPD conducts the procurement of
pharmaceutical/medical goods in a transparent, well organised and soundly managed
organisation that is successfully dealing with the procedures throughout the Kingdom.
Additionally, based on conducted studies, many major global pharmaceutical companies and a
large number of generic producers from various countries are present in the market and can
participate through their local agents.

 56. Acknowledging the prevailing emergency conditions of the project, a waiver of some of
the provisions of the Bank’s Anti-Corruption Guidelines is sought from the Board of Executive
Directors allowing the Bank to rely on the Borrower’s national Anti-Corruption Commission
(ACC) for investigation of cases of fraud and corruption in the use of project funds for individual
contracts, both retrospective and prospective, under US$5 million. This waiver applies to
vaccine and medicine contracts subject to retroactive financing (those contracts that have already
been signed and fully paid) as well as those vaccine and medicine contracts not yet signed, but
which are valued at less than US$5 million each and are being procured using national
procurement methods. It is proposed that for these contracts only, the ACGs be modified to
permit the Bank to rely on the Borrower’s national ACC to investigate cases of fraud and
corruption in the use of loan funds. Under the modified provisions, the Borrower would have an
obligation to report the findings of any such investigation to the Bank as well as to make
available all documentary and other evidence arising, and to allow the Bank to review relevant
books and records and to meet relevant persons.

57.     In addition, specific mitigation measures have been included in the project (two special
purpose audits relating to retroactive financing, technical audits and financial verification). The
total loan amount subject to the modified provisions is estimated at between US$38-50 million,
of which up to US$21 million represent contracts subject to retroactive financing. To mitigate
the risk of some international firms not learning of the opportunities on time, packages above
US$500,000, which are still to be procured, will additionally have timely notification in UNDB
online and the JPD website would include the English version of the advertisement (see Annex 3
for further details). All project procurement above the US$5 million threshold will remain
subject to standard Bank terms, conditions and policies, including the application of the ACGs.

 58. Regarding application of Anti-Corruption Guidelines, it should be noted that the JPD
contracts do not explicitly contain clauses related to fraud and corruption, but are governed by
the national anti-corruption rules providing for the exclusive jurisdiction of the ACC, an
independent agency, in cases of fraud and corruption. Therefore, a waiver of some provisions of
the World Bank Anti-Corruption Guidelines is sought to rely on the Borrower’s national ACC to
investigate cases of fraud and corruption in the use of project funds for the aforementioned
contracts (under US$5 million). The waiver specifically proposes the modification of paragraph
9 and the deletion of paragraph 10, which currently provide, among others, for the right of the
Bank to inspect accounts, records and all other documents of the Borrower or other recipients of
loan proceeds relating to the Project. These paragraphs will be substituted with modified
provisions stating the obligation of the Borrower to undertake investigations in case of allegation
of fraud and corruption and provide related reports to the Bank (Modified Anti-Corruption
Provisions; see Annex 3). This approach is similar and along the lines adopted in Program-for-
Results Financing (PforR) projects. All other procurement for contracts for goods and services

equivalent to or above the threshold of US$5,000,000 will be subject to prior review, to the
Anti-Corruption Guidelines and to all other standard Bank terms and conditions. Specific
mitigation measures are outlined in Annex 3.


   D.    Social (including Safeguards)

 59. The project will respond directly to several social concerns of Jordanian citizens through
supporting continuing availability of critical basic services including health and bread and gas
subsidies in the face of the refugee crisis. It will help the ministries continue to provide services,
especially to those in the governorates with large refugee populations. Because the project is
meant to help mitigate the risks of potential impacts due to unmet demands of Jordanian citizens,
there is reduced chance of social tensions related to shortages of basic household goods. In fact,
the social impact of this project is likely to be positive.

 60. The design, nature and scope of the project do not result in social safeguards issues and
therefore the safeguards policies are not triggered as a result of project interventions.

   E.    Environment (including Safeguards)

 61. The project is classified as Category C according to the World Bank Operation Policy on
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01). The design, nature and scope of the project do not result
in environmental safeguards issues and therefore safeguards policies are not triggered as a result
of project interventions. The project will finance the procurement of vaccines and drugs; medical
bills of patients who will need to go to non-MOH facilities due to crowding-out effect—both as a
result of increasing use of public services by the influx of Syrian refugees into Jordan, resulting
in stress on public resources. Drugs and vaccines that will be procured through the project by the
JPD are subsequently supplied to MOH warehouses who distribute them to the various health
care facilities as and when there is a demand due to shortage of stocks. Healthcare facilities will
continue functioning in the present manner in relation to management of medical wastes.
Additionally, the project will finance subsidies for bread (wheat) and LPG cylinders, in order to
support basic household needs. The project will not involve any construction related civil works.
OP 4.01 and other environmental safeguard policies will not be triggered and therefore the need
to prepare an environmental safeguards-related instrument does not arise.

                           HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
       Emergency Project to Assist Jordan Partially Mitigate the Impact of Syrian Conflict
                                          (P145865)

Background

 1.     Jordan has a long history of hospitality towards refugees and the country is currently
hosting approximately 2 million registered Palestinian refugees of which approximately 350,000
live in camps 12, and another 30,000 Iraqis are registered with UNHCR. 13 The Jordanian
Government has likewise kept the border open for Syrians since the conflict broke out in March
2011. Syrians entered the country freely and settled in urban settlement on their own, until
Zaatari camp opened in northern Jordan in July 2012, when the Syrian refugee population
according to Government estimates had increased to 150,000. As of June 13, 2013, almost
540,000 had registered or were awaiting registration with UNHCR, a number that is expected to
continue to increase as the daily arrivals continue to rise. Approximately 170,000 currently
reside in Zaatari camp, and a second camp with a capacity of 30,000 has opened in Zarqa with
support of the United Arab Emirates. A third camp with a planned capacity of 50,000 is currently
under construction at Azraq. Still the majority of Syrians reside in host communities across
Jordan, with a concentration in the northern region and Amman.

 2.     The Government decided early in 2012 to allow Syrian children to attend public schools,
and medical facilities have also remained open for Syrians seeking treatment. To prevent the
spread of communicable diseases, extensive vaccinations of Syrians have taken place upon
arrival – an effort that will be extended to Jordanians to preclude the reemergence of previously
eradicated diseases. In addition, they have alongside their Jordanian hosts made use of non-
exclusionary benefits, such as subsidies on energy, water, bread and gas.

 3.     The Government of Jordan has not extended an automatic permission to work, and
Syrians have had to apply for work permits under the same conditions as other foreign workers.
As a result, while they are not competing with Jordanians for skilled jobs in the formal sector,
there is some evidence to suggest that Syrians are entering the informal sector where they are
undercutting Jordanian wages and working conditions. With localized spikes in basic commodity
prices and lower-scale rents in areas where the concentrations of refugees are high, there are
strong indications that it is the poorer segment of the Jordanian population with minimal shock
absorption capacity that are feeling the brunt of the impact.

 4.     The Government has been seeking international financial support to cover the
expenditures incurred due to the Syrian displacement through a regularly updated Response Plan,
coordinated by the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation. This plan compiles the
estimated needs (current costs and projected capital investment costs) in the sectors mostly
affected by the increased demand for services and benefits; including health, education, energy,
water, municipal services, subsidies and security.

 5.    Support by the international community has been concentrated on meeting the immediate
humanitarian needs of the Syrian displaced. The construction and running of Zaatari camp is
almost fully funded by external sources, and some UN agencies and international NGOs are
providing additional assistance to Syrian households in the form of, for example, cash and
vouchers as well as reimbursement of health and education expenses. Most bilateral donors have
channeled their support through UN agencies or NGO, while only a few have supported the
Government directly, such as a recent US$200 million grant from the United States.

Health

 6.     Jordan’s health sector made significant progress in the last decade. Jordan’s health
indicators are above regional and upper middle- income averages with life expectancy for both
sexes being 74 years, under five mortality rate of 21 per 1,000 live births, and maternal mortality
ratio of 63 per 100,000. 14 Antenatal coverage with at least four visits and births attended by
skilled health personnel are both quite high at 94 percent and 99 percent of pregnant women,
respectively. Current immunization coverage among children under the age of one is also very
high at 98 percent for measles, DPT3, HepB3 and Hib3, which is among the highest in the
region. About 75 percent of children with ARI symptoms are taken to a health facility and 79
percent receive antibiotics for treatment. With the Government’s strategy to ensure access to
health services within 10 km proximity to all citizens including those residing in remote areas,
the country established a wide network of primary health care centers (PHCCs) supported by a
range of secondary and tertiary care facilities. However, continuity and sustainability of health
service delivery in Jordan is at risk of being severely compromised as a result of the upsurge in
demand for healthcare by the influx of the Syrian refugees.

 7.     The healthcare needs of the Syrian refugees are different from those of the settled
populations because of the different demographic mix, living conditions and vulnerabilities,
requiring therefore a different mix of services and mode of health system response to respond to
their needs. Such an upsurge both in demand and the mix of healthcare needs could easily
overwhelm the existing facilities especially in Jordan where the absorptive capacity is relatively
low given its own population size relative to the size of the refugee population. According to
UNHCR data, 78 percent of the Syrian refugees are vulnerable requiring additional assistance.
This include women (49 percent), children under the age of 12 (40 percent), and elderly (2.1
percent). In addition, 23 percent of Syrian refugees have chronic diseases or serious medical
conditions that require medical follow up. Comparative morbidity data show a different disease
profile with increased levels of morbidity for Syrian refugees than Jordanians which may affect
the disease burden in the future. According to Jordan’s national cancer statistics, Syrian refugees
presenting with cancer at health facilities rose from 134 in 2011 to 169 in the first quarter of
2013, representing 14 percent increase in Jordan’s total cancer disease burden. Similarly, MOH
morbidity data show a rise in selected communicable diseases. For example, TB case notification
increased from 5/100,000 among Jordanians in 2009 to 13/100,000 among Syrian refugees in
2013. While no measles cases have been reported in Jordan since 2009, recent MOH data show
that 18 Jordanians and 23 Syrians have been diagnosed with the disease in 2013. Polio which had
been eradicated since 1999 was also detected in two cases in 2013. With this higher demand for

health services and the GOJ’s policy to provide refugees with access to MOH health care
services, facilities especially in the north, are witnessing a dramatic increase in the use of
services that is exceeding their capacity.

 8.    It is evident that this dramatic change in the demographic and epidemiologic conditions
in Jordan as a result of the Syrian conflict is taking its toll on the health sector. Demand for
services by refugees at MOH facilities increased significantly. MOH data show that the number
of outpatient visits to MOH PHCCs by Syrian refugees increased from 68 in January 2012 to
15,975 in March 2013 (Figure 1). Similarly and during the same period, Syrian refugees
admitted to MOH hospital increased from 300 admissions to 10,330 associated with a sharp
increase in the number of surgeries performed at these hospitals going from 105 to 622 surgeries.

               Figure 1: Use of MOH services by: January 2012-March 2013




 9.     MOH facilities in the northern part of the country are shouldering the greatest burden
from the refugee influx. For example, Figure 2 shows utilization rates in the Women and
Children Hospital in the northern city of Ramtha during the first three months of 2013, where
children and women outpatient visits increased by more than 300 percent and 400 percent,
respectively. As the figure indicates, the number of deliveries increased from 8,157 in 2011 to
10,097 in 2012, a 27.2 percent jump. In the first three months of 2013 alone, the number of
deliveries rose by 30.3 percent going from 66 in January to 86 deliveries in March.

 10. In response to the health crisis of the Syrian refugees, the MOH mobilized significant
human and financial resources to address the increased demand for health services. The MOH is
projecting a 23.4 percent increase in expenditure on drugs. Due to the high number of children
among the Syrian refugees, the MOH’s procurement of vaccines almost doubled going from
around US$12 million in 2012 to US$20 million in 2013. The MOH is projecting expenditures
on vaccines in 2014 to reach around US$34.5 million.

           Figure 2: Use of Services in Women and Children Hospital, Ramtha, 2013




 11. The surge in refugees is also putting pressure on the Jordanian people particularly those
in the north, and on their ability to access health services. With PHCCs and hospitals reaching
their full capacity, Jordanians are facing delayed access to public facilities. According to
Jordanian law, Jordanians are eligible for free health care in MOH facilities, so while the MOH
is providing health services to the refugees, efforts continue to maintain Jordanians’ access to
health care services. Currently, a significant number of Jordanians requiring hospital care are
being referred to non-MOH facilities. MOH data indicate that between 2011 and 2012, referrals
to non-MOH hospitals increased by 11 percent to 10,069 cases while the cost of referrals surged
50 percent to around US$124 million in 2012.

 12. With the continuing crisis, the health sector is facing significant financial pressures and
shortages, particularly drugs and vaccines that are being rapidly depleted. With the influx
expected to continue in the near future, more resources are required to cope with the situation.
Access to health care for underserved Jordanians is currently jeopardized. Financing some of the
immediate healthcare needs, mainly hospital referrals, drugs and vaccines will help alleviate the
burden of the Syrian crisis on affected communities, improve the fiscal ability of the MOH to
reimburse the non-MOH providers for its services, and assist the MOH to maintain its
commitment for timely access to health care to its citizens.

 13. The project will finance a total of US$50 million of drugs and vaccines. 15 This figure is
estimated based on: (i) the gross rate of pre-crisis consumption in medicine, namely in 2010 and
2011; (ii) projected increase in the procurement of generic drugs at the rate of 3 percent (this rate
was estimated based on pre-crisis rates of increase, as well as the standard rate of increase set by
15
  Medications received by the MOH from JPD – which procures drugs and vaccines for the MOH - are distributed
to seven MOH warehouses around the country. The inventory is then distributed to the PHCCs and hospitals
according to their projected need. Upon receipt of medications, representatives from PHCCs and hospitals sign
documents listing the names and quantities of drugs received prior to transporting the inventory to the facilities.

the GOJ given its goal of increasing the share of generic drugs procured); and (iii) actual
procurement of medication. Table 1 shows that while the rate of increase between 2010 and 2011
was around 4.4 percent, the increase in cost of drugs was 12.7 percent in 2012, 35 percent in
2013, and is expected to be 37 percent in 2014. The program is designed to compensate the
MOH for the increase in cost of drugs procured as a result of the influx of Syrian refugees. In
2012, the program will finance six months’ worth of drugs procured between July – December
2012, totaling US$5 million; the full cost of drugs procured in 2013 totaling US$29.4 million;
and the first six months of 2014 (January-June) at US$16 million. This amounts to US$50
million.

 14. In addition, the project will finance a total of US$20 million for treatments for Jordanian
patients. To accommodate the needs of the Jordanian population, the MOH has been referring
patients to non-MOH hospitals at a higher cost than at its own facilities. The MOH’s system for
referring patients to non-MOH facilities is as follows: treatment of the uninsured is under the
auspices the Royal Diwan for Medical Services - Department of the Uninsured, based at the
MOH. This program is only for the uninsured Jordanians. The Department has the responsibility
of receiving, reviewing, validating, and approving referrals to non-MOH facilities. Uninsured
patients referred from MOH providers for lack of availability of needed treatment have to submit
an application with a medical report to the department. The department first conducts a screening
to validate that the patient is uninsured and that he/she does not have any other sources of
coverage. Once verified, the department will refer the patient to the MOH employees’ clinic
department to conduct a medical check-up to validate the medical diagnosis and need for
treatment. Based on the results, the MOH will recommend the patient’s referral to the most
appropriate and cost effective hospital. The referral documents are then approved by the director
of the department of the Royal Diwan for medical services. Consequently, the MOH receives
monthly bills from the hospitals with listings of all patient names and invoices. The MOH has
medical auditors who select 10% of the bills for detailed review and auditing. The medical
auditing is considered both a technical and financial audit since it will validate the appropriate
utilization of services based on the medical condition of the patient as well as the billing of these
services according to the set rates.

 15. The project will finance US$20 million towards the cost of treatment of Jordanian
patients with highest need for care referred by the MOH to non-MOH facilities, focusing on
patients living in the most affected areas in Jordan and who have urgent conditions. A cost
ceiling of US$10,000 per patient will be adhered to. The estimates are based on data showing an
increasing trend in the numbers and costs of referrals from before the influx of refugees to the

                                                 37
present time. In 2012, the overall cost of treatment in non-MOH facilities totaled US$242 million
indicating a 50% increase from 2011. Using El-Hussein Cancer Center as a baseline for analysis
(Table 2), the unit cost for treatment increased from US$6158 to US$7600.

on all invoices of eligible patients (around 2500 patients) before payment from the loan can be
made (see Annex 3, FM and Disbursement Arrangements).

Bread and LPG Subsidy Programs

 17. Similar to other countries in the region, the GOJ has a long history of providing broad-
based price subsidies for basic household commodities. These programs have, for the most part,
been generalized and untargeted. As international food prices have at times increased drastically,
the sustainability of these programs has repeatedly been called into question. In 1990, for
example, food subsidies reached 3.9 percent of GDP. 16 Several waves of reform aiming to
sequentially reduce their fiscal impact have taken place over the years. Reforms have included
the use of food vouchers for which only Jordanian households were eligible (i.e., excluding
migrant workers, tourists, etc.), the use of generalized cash transfers, and the use of targeted cash
transfer from the National Assistance Fund (NAF). Reforms of these programs have, however,
often been reversed. A major reform of the bread subsidy in 1996 which saw the complete
elimination of the price support and its replacement by a cash transfer was rapidly overturned as
large demonstrations and unrest followed. 17

 18. The bread and LPG cylinders programs are simple in their design and enable all
households living in Jordan to access basic necessities, as these are universal untargeted
programs. Both programs are on-budget, as opposed to subsidies on water or electricity so the
link between increased consumer demand and the GOJ budget is clearer. Jordan’s bread subsidy
program is indirect as the Government subsidizes wheat but also sets the price of bread at the
bakery level. The subsidized bread is very specific and has defined standards. The bread subsidy
chain runs from the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) which is the sole importer of wheat
in the country. The MOIT sells imported wheat (along with small quantities in domestically
procured wheat) to mills at a pre-set price. This price is established with a view to (i) keeping the
price of the subsidized bread constant at the bakery level; and (ii) maintaining a given profit
margin for mills. Mills transforms the wheat into flour which is then sold on to bakeries. This
flour is very specific and used specifically for this type of bread. Bakeries sell the subsidized
bread at a regulated retail price of JD0.16/kg. This price has been unchanged since 1996.

19. Jordan’s subsidized LPG cylinder program is a direct subsidy scheme administered by the
Ministry of Finance and implemented by the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company (JPRC). JPRC

is the sole importer of LPG in Jordan (more generally, JPRC is the sole provider of petroleum
products in the country). Through its LPG cylinder factory, it sells two types of LPG cylinders in
Jordan: a 12.5kg cylinder, the price of which is subsidized and regulated by the Government.
This cylinder is aimed at households and it is used for home cooking and also space heating. The
other cylinder produced is a 50kg cylinder, which is not aimed at households and is not
subsidized.

 20. While the GOJ took measures to reduce the budgetary cost of food subsidies after the
2007 global food and fuel crisis, these have risen significantly since the onset of the Syrian
conflict. Food subsidies increased very sharply between 2005 and 2007. They declined in 2008
after the GOJ reduced direct food subsidies to only wheat and barley (the latter is used for animal
feeds, which is not expected to be materially impacted by the Syrian refugee influx). Total food
and gas subsidies decreased between 2007 and 2010, from 11.2 percent of total central
government expenditure to 3.3 percent. In 2010, the bread and LPG subsidy programs amounted
to JD103 million and JD69 million, respectively (a total of 0.9 percent of GDP). By 2012, these
programs had reached JD190 million and JD110 million, respectively (a total of 1.4 percent of
GDP). The analysis below points to the Syrian crisis and the refugee influx as key drivers of the
increased fiscal cost.

 21. An econometric analysis shows that the Syrian conflict is significantly and materially
increasing demand for subsidized bread in Jordan. While consumption of subsidized flour
decreased by 9.6 percent from 2007 to 2008, it remained remarkably stable for the subsequent
three years (volumes consumed decreased by 0.6 percent from 2008 to 2009, and rose by 2
percent from 2009 to 2010). Over the three years prior to the Syrian conflict, consumption
hovered around 44.6 metric tons per month. Then, starting in 2011, consumption started to
steadily increase. Average consumption for the first five months of 2013 is 20.4 percent higher
than the average monthly consumption of 2010 (the increase is particularly strong among
Jordan’s northern governorates, i.e., close to the Syrian border and also where the highest
number of refugees reside). As retail price is unchanged, any increase in quantities consumed is
expected to be primarily driven by a rise in consumer numbers. 18 This is confirmed by an
econometric analysis of the determinants of subsidized flour volumes. 19 The analysis reveals that
the marked change in consumption trend in Jordan is well explained by the influx of Syrian
refugees and the price gap. All the coefficients have the expected sign. The refugee variable is
statistically significant and with a relatively stable coefficient in most specifications used. The
price gap variable was less robust to specification changes. This variable captures incentives to
smuggle subsidized Jordanian bread abroad. 20 As the price gap widens, this incentive increases.


18
   This arises as behavioral changes—such as tastes—or income and substitution effects would not be expected to
have a large impact over short periods of time for such a staple product as bread. The stable consumption pattern
from 2008 to 2010 testifies to this stability when consumer numbers are not rising significantly.
19
  The dependent variable (volume of subsidized four) was regressed on (1) the number of UNHCR-registered
Syrian refugees, (2) the gap between the flour import price and the mills price, and (3) lags of the dependent
variable. Monthly data from January 2007 to May 2013 were used.
20
   This smuggling activity is also likely capturing another impact of the Syrian conflict on Jordan. As supplies,
bakeries, and logistics in Syria are being disrupted by the conflict, potential shortages and rising prices in Syria
increase the incentive to get bread supplies from Jordan. The larger the price gap between Jordan’s subsidized price
and the “international? price, the stronger the incentive to supply in Jordan.

                                                        39
 22. Based on the regression coefficients of the econometric analysis, the increase in
consumption related to the Syrian conflict is estimated at 77,773 metric tons of flour during the
period of retroactivity (June 2012-June 2013). This accounts for 80 percent of the increase in
volume observed since the 2010 pre-crisis baseline and 12.2 percent of total flour demand. With
an estimated average subsidy of US$385.7 per metric ton of flour, the estimated retroactive
financing for this component of the project reaches US$30 million. For the period July 2013-
June 2014, assuming the unit subsidy cost is unchanged the project proposes to finance 64,811
metric tons of flour for a component financing cost of US$25 million.

 23. An analysis of demand responses to large regulated LPG price changes pre- and post-
Syrian crisis reveals that the demand for LPG cylinders is driven by the rise in Syrian refugees
(along with some likely smuggling activity towards Syria). Gas cylinder demand has risen by
one third between 2010 and 2012. Lack of sufficiently long time series and variable availability
did not allow undertaking an econometric analysis of the determinants of this demand. The
impact of Syrian-related effect on LPG demand is, therefore, inferred by analyzing two large
LPG price changes of similar magnitude: one that took place prior to the Syrian conflict
(February 2008), the other after (November 2012). As LPG cylinder is not a Giffen good—a type
of inferior good whose demand rises as its price rises—these price increases should have, ceteris
paribus, led to a fall in demand. Such a fall in consumption did occur after the 2008 price
change: a 53 percent price increase led to a 4 percent decrease in consumption. This was,
however, not the case after the November 2012 price change: a similar price increase (54
percent) led to an 8 percent increase in consumption between December 2012 and December
2010 (the pre-crisis baseline). These sharply different consumption responses are even larger
once one controls for smuggling incentives: 21 these were about twice as large in real terms in
2008 than in 2012. Only a large influx of new gas consumers can explain such stark differences
in consumption to these very similar price shocks.

 24. To quantify the specific impact on demand of the Syrian conflict, it is assumed that the
rise in consumption can be captured by the number of Syrian refugees in the country. 22 Given
the estimated number of refugees during the retroactive period (July 2012-June 2013) and their
average consumption, it is estimated that a total of 1,809,409 million cylinders would be
financed by the project for a total cost of US$9 million. These 1,809,409 million cylinders
represent 23.5 percent of the increase in the cylinder demand since 2010 and 6.2 percent of total
2012 consumption. For the period July 2013-June 2014, assuming unchanged subsidy per
cylinder, the operation envisages to finance 3,196,622 million cylinders for a cost of $15.9
million. This projected demand critically depends on estimates of the growth in refugee influx
21
  Similar to the analysis undertaken for the determinants of bread consumption these are captured by the difference
between the imported price and the retail price of the LPG cylinder. A larger gap, as was the case after the 2008
price change compared to the post 2012 price change period, would induce traders to buy LPG domestically and
export it so as to cash in the subsidized value; this would increase domestic demand for LPG cylinders.
22
   More precisely, it is assumed that the average consumption of a refugee equals that of an average Jordanian.
While this assumption might at first seem high for refugees, it embeds a number of factors and is therefore
considered to be realistic. For example, it captures not only the demand arising from Syrian nationals present in
Jordan, but also the demand likely to be rising demand from Syrians residing in Syria as the impact of the conflict is
likely negatively impacting LPG supplies and deliveries. Another factor is that as Syrian refugees are expected, on
average, to be poorer than the average Jordanian (given initial difference in average GDP per capita and the loss in
income and wealth that refugees endure). As a result, Syrian refugees are likely to have a large share of their
consumption basket devoted to subsidized LPG.

                                                         40
during the forecast period. For the period July 2013-June 2014, the average Syrian refugee
population in Jordan is expected to reach 727,547 or 11.7 percent of the Jordanian population.
These forecasts are slightly more conservative than the latest UNHCR projections.

 25. Bread and LPG products are progressive and relatively heavily consumed products by
Jordanian households. These two products are progressive in the sense that poorer households
spend a larger share of their total expenditure on them (World Bank, 2009, 201123). They
account for about 7 percent of poor households’ total consumption but only 2 percent of the
richest Jordanian households. More specifically, Jordanians households in the bottom decile,
spend 3.6 percent of their expenditures on subsidized food items, whereas for the richest 3
deciles that share falls to below 1 percent. Similarly, the poorest 20 percent Jordanian households
spend 2.3 percent of their total spending on LPG compared to 1 percent for the richest 20 percent
households(World Bank, 2012 24). Bread and LPG also account for a relatively large share of
poor households’ total spending so disruption to their supply would have a material impact on
these households.

 26. Financing bread and LPG products would self-target households in need of assistance due
to the impact of the Syrian conflict. Several channels would generate self-targeting. First, the
many Jordanian households that are hosting Syrian refugees would see their demand for bread,
cooking and heating gas increase. Second, poor and lower middle class Jordanian households are
also likely to be impacted by the crisis through reduced income and purchasing power. This
could arise, for example, as some of the refugees enter the labor force in Jordan—most likely in
the large informal sector—and put downward pressure on wages, especially those of unskilled
and therefore more vulnerable Jordanian workers. An impact on the purchasing power of
Jordanian households would be the strong upward pressure on rents reported in areas of high
refugee density. This arises as a rapid and large increase in housing demand cannot be met by a
concomitant increase in housing supply, given long response lags of the latter. As incomes and
purchasing power of some Jordanian households come under pressure, their reliance on staple
products such as bread and LPG will grow. The operation ensures that these self-selecting
channels remain available to Jordanians who most need them during hardship times.

 27. While untargeted subsidies are costly and inefficient, the ministries in charge of the bread
and gas subsidy programs are studying technical means to improve efficiency. Options include
refining the current cash transfer that was introduced in November 2012 to compensate
households for the elimination of petroleum price subsidies. Refinement could include the use of
proxy means testing to better target the intended beneficiaries. The GOJ is currently estimating
technical options to obtain a good proxy means testing, as part of a Unified Registry Transition
Fund project with the World Bank. In addition, the use of smart cards is being considered to
provide fixed quantities of subsidized product. Such programs could materially reduce the fiscal
cost of the program even without reducing the benefit value and coverage to Jordanian
households. World Bank staff is engaged in technical assistance and policy advice to the
Government of Jordan on these issues.

                           HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
       Emergency Project to Assist Jordan Partially Mitigate the Impact of Syrian Conflict
                                          (P145865)


A.         Project Institutional and Implementation Arrangements

1. The project will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) who will implement the
project through its regular budget implementation and monitoring mechanisms. Hence, there will
be no separate project implementation/management unit established. Implementation of the
project is primarily related to financial management of bills, payments, and verifications/audits.
Such transactions are part of MOF’s function, and therefore it is logical that it be the
implementing agency. In addition, MOF manages the budget for the subsidies program, which is
more than half of the project, and they are implementing the large cash transfer program for
subsidy compensation (supported by a World Bank project) 25, which requires a large amount of
budget handling, payments, and advanced IT systems. However, in light of the fact that MOF has
limited experience with the World Bank financial management and disbursement guidelines,
training will be provided to a qualified accountant that will be appointed by MOF from its staff
who will follow up on the financial management and disbursement aspects of the project. In
addition, the project will finance the following additional support for MOF: (i) hiring an audit
firm to verify retroactive expenditures on vaccines and drugs; (ii) hiring an audit firm to perform
the annual audit on the project (could be same firm); (iii) hiring a consulting firm from the
project funds to perform a technical and financial verification of medical bills for patients
referred to the non-MOH health facilities.

2. With respect to the procurement of drugs and vaccines, the project will rely on Jordan’s
existing system for procurement through the Joint Procurement Department (JPD). The JPD is
the central organization in Jordan which procures most of pharmaceuticals in the Kingdom. The
JPD, which began operations in 2004, based on by-law No. 91 of 2002 - Medicines and Medical
Supplies – conducts the procurement of pharmaceutical/medical goods in a transparent, well
organised and sound manner.

Financial Management

3. The Project financial management and disbursement functions will be managed by the
Finance Department at MOF. A qualified Accountant will be identified from MOF Finance
Department to follow on the financial management and disbursement aspects with all
stakeholders. The MOF has limited prior experience with implementing of World Bank projects;
therefore, the World Bank team will provide adequate training to an Accountant to ensure full
understanding and application of the World Bank financial management and disbursement
Policies and Procedures. A Coordination Officer will be designated from the Joint Procurement
Department? (JPD) who will be responsible for collecting the data and documentation for MOF.

                                                        42
The Officer will be in close coordination with MOF Accountant on FM and disbursement related
issues.

4. Project Financial Management Risk. The overall FM risk is “Substantial?. With
mitigation measures in place, the project will have acceptable project financial management
arrangements; its financial management risk rating will be “Moderate?. The FM risk is assessed
as “Substantial?, mainly due to:

          i.   Limited prior experience and knowledge of MOF staff of World Bank financial
               management and disbursement guidelines;
         ii.   Possible limited coordination between MOF and JPD that could cause delays in
               payments and financial reporting;
        iii.   Standard financial audit may not provide adequate assurance given the specifics
               of each component;
        iv.    Accounting systems at MOF are not capable of generating the quarterly IFRs as
               per the World Bank guidelines;
         v.    Loan proceeds financed ineligible drugs as per the Rational Drug List under
               retroactive financing;
        vi.    Ineligible referred patients to the non-JPD hospitals and health facilities or
               inflated medical bills.

5. The following measures are to be taken to mitigate FM-related risks:

          i.   A qualified Accountant will be identified from MOF Finance Department;
         ii.   Adequate training will be provided to the Accountant on the World Bank financial
               management and disbursement guidelines;
        iii.   Within 3 months of effectiveness, an independent external auditor, acceptable to
               the World Bank, will be hired to audit the project’s annual financial statements in
               accordance with terms of reference (TOR) acceptable to the World Bank. The
               auditor will also assess the effectiveness of internal controls within the project;
        iv.    Within 3 months of effectiveness, a consultancy firm will be contracted to
               perform technical and financial audit of medical bills of patients referred to the
               non-MOH hospitals and health facilities before payment;
         v.    Within 3 months of effectiveness, an audit firm will be contracted to perform
               special purpose audit of the funds disbursed under retroactive financing (US$21
               Million) for vaccines and drugs;
        vi.    Robust auditing arrangements will be spelled out in the TORs to provide
               reasonable assurance that the proceeds of the loan are used for the intended
               purposes;
       vii.    A simplified format using spread sheets will be used to generate the quarterly
               IFRs;
       viii.   The Directorate of Purchases and Supplies- MOH will submit to MOF the
               inventory reports within sufficient time (30 days after the end of quarter) in order
               to give MOF time to include in the IFRs before submission to the Bank;
        ix.    The World Bank team will intensively supervise the Project, particularly early in
               implementation.



                                                43
6. Budgeting. The activities to be financed under this Project are well identified as described in
each of the two components with their respective allocation. Those activities are already
budgeted under the budget law of 2012 and 2013. For activities to be financed during 2014, a
budget line item will be established in the budget Law of 2014 under MOF. A breakdown of the
cost of each item by component is agreed upon during preparation and will be monitored by
MOF during the implementation. Variance analysis will be provided along with the quarterly
Interim Unaudited Financial Reports (IFRs) to be submitted by MOF.

7. Internal Controls. The Project’s expenditure cycle will follow the controls specified in the
National Financial System of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which include: (i) technical
approval of department involved; (ii) finance staff checking and approval; (iii) resident Internal
Auditors who validates the accuracy of the payment and its compliance with the applicable laws
in Jordan and with the World Bank procurement and FM procedures as well as the Loan terms
and conditions. Complementing that, the Project will have in place supplementary controls for
monitoring project activities including the Bank’s financial management guidelines with respect
to financial reporting requirements and disbursement procedures.

8. Inventory Management: Under Component 1, the Project will finance the purchase of
vaccinations and drugs to the order of US$ 50 million, out of which US$ 21 million is financed
retroactively. Therefore, the World Bank assessed the inventory management system at the
Directorate of Purchases and Supplies (MOH) in order to have a reasonable assurance about the
safeguard and storage of the drugs procured under the project and collection by beneficiary
hospitals and medical centers. The assessment concluded that the inventory management system
at the Directorate of Purchases and Supplies (MOH) is adequate to safeguard the drugs procured.
The policies and procedures over inventory management are properly recorded in the National
Financial System of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, including control procedures over
receipt and release of inventory to beneficiary hospitals and health (collected from beneficiary
hospitals and medical centers from the central warehouses) and recording of such transactions.
Such controls ensure proper receipt of goods by the Directorate of Purchases and Supplies
(MOH) as evidenced by signed receipt documents confirming the quantity received, and signed
by authorized officials validating the order received is acceptable. The Jordan audit Bureau, the
Government auditor, performs annual audit of MOH including the operations of the Directorate
of Purchases and Supplies (MOH). Additional specific controls will be applied for this operation
over inventory, including: i) separate accounts will be established in the inventory management
system for drugs purchased under the Loan, ii) system generated reports of Project inventory will
be submitted and included in the quarterly IFRs, iii) the Jordan Audit Bureau annual audit reports
issued for the operations the Directorate of Purchases and Supplies (MOH) will be requested and
reviewed, (iv) during the World Bank implementation support missions, the inventory operations
will be reviewed, and (v) the work scope of the external auditor, to be hired to perform audit of
the Project’s accounts, will specifically request performing physical check of inventory.

9. External Audits and Audit Reports Due Dates. Given the peculiarities of each component,
the following audit reports are due for submission:

       i.      Component 1 (Financing of vaccines and drugs): within 3 months of
       effectiveness, an acceptable audit firm will be contracted to perform audit of the funds
       disbursed under retroactive financing (US$ 21 Million) for vaccines and drugs. The
       auditor will issue a special opinion on drugs being procured as per the Rational Drug List,
                                               44
       the corresponding stocks registers, and inventory controls in the assigned warehouses.
       The expected due date is November 30, 2013.

       ii.      Component 1 (Financing of medical care for Jordanians in non-MOH health
       facilities): a consultancy firm will be contracted to perform technical (medical) and
       financial audit of medical bills of patients referred to the non-MOH hospitals and health
       facilities before being processed for payment by MOF. The scope of work of the
       consultancy firm will include; i) verifying that referrals are issued in accordance with
       MOH procedures, ii) ensure appropriateness of referrals and use of service according to
       health needs, and iii) reasonableness of medical bills of the non-MOH hospitals and
       health facilities.

       iii.   Within 3 months after the closing date, the auditor will audit the Project Financial
       Statements covering the project's 12-month lifetime, the expected due date is October 31,
       2014.

10. These audits will be carried out in in accordance with international standards of auditing
based on TORs acceptable to the Bank. MOF will be responsible for preparing the TORs for the
auditor and submitting them to the Bank for clearance. The final payment for the auditor after the
closing date will be transferred from the Loan account to an escrow account maintained by MOF.
According to the World Bank Policy on Access to Information issued on July 1, 2010, the audit
report with audited financial statements of the project will be made available to the public.

11. Accounting and Reporting. The project will follow the cash basis of accounting where
resources and uses of funds are recorded when cash is received or when payments are made. The
GoJ has rolled out in the majority of line ministries and budget units the Government Financial
Management Information System (GFMIS) for budget preparation and execution however, since
this project is not included in the budget Law of 2013, GFMIS will not be used for this operation
but will be used during the year 2014 after Project is included in the budget Law of 2014. As
GFMIS is not capable of generating the IFRs the Project will use Excel sheets to generate the
quarterly IFRs. The reports will consist of Statement of Cash Receipts and Payments by category
and accounting policies and explanatory notes, including a footnote disclosure on schedules: (i)
wheat and LPG sales in tons, unit costs calculation, and subsidy value at the end of each period,
(ii) “the list of Contracts above US$ 200,000 showing Contract amounts committed, paid, and
unpaid under each contract?, (iii) Reconciliation Statement for the balance of the Designated
Account, and (iv) a list of vaccines and drugs generated from inventory system of “Directorate of
Purchases and Supplies? (MOH). MOF will prepare the IFRs and submit to the Bank by no later
than 45 days after the end of each quarter.

12. Training and Implementation Support. The World Bank team will intensively supervise
the Project, particularly early in implementation, and will provide adequate training to an
Accountant to ensure full understanding and application of the World Bank financial
management and disbursement Policies and Procedures.

    Funds Flow and Disbursement Arrangements

    13. Designated Account (DA). To ensure that funds are readily available for project
    implementation, a DA will be opened for MOF at the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ). This
    account will have a ceiling of US$60,000,000 and will be managed by MOF. Authorized
    signatories, names and corresponding specimens of their signatures would be submitted to the
    Bank prior to the receipt of the first Withdrawal Application.

    14. The proceeds of the Loan will be disbursed in accordance with the Bank's disbursements
    guidelines as will be outlined in the Disbursement Letter and in accordance with the Bank
    Disbursement Guidelines for Projects. Transaction-based disbursement will be used under this
    project. Accordingly, requests for payments from the loan will be initiated through the use of
    withdrawal applications (WAs) either for direct payments, reimbursements, and replenishments
    to the DA. All WAs will include appropriate supporting documentation including detailed SOEs
    and certification for reimbursements and replenishments to the DA. The category of Eligible
    Expenditures that may be financed out of the proceeds of the loan and the percentage of
    expenditures to be financed for Eligible Expenditures are outlined in the table to follow.
    Necessary supporting documents will be sent to the Bank in connection with contracts as
    described below under detailed flow of funds of each component. The documentation supporting
    expenditures will be retained at MOF and will be readily accessible for review by the external
    auditors and Bank supervision missions. All disbursements will be subject to the conditions of
    the Loan Agreement and disbursement procedures as will be defined in the Disbursement Letter.

    15. The table below summarizes the disbursement requirements for each Project’s components:

    16. The detailed flow of funds for each component are described as follows:

    17. Component 1 (Maintaining Access to Essential Healthcare Services) will finance the
    following public expenses:

            A.      Financing for vaccines and drugs. Retroactive financing of up to US$21 Million
            would be provided to finance the cost of vaccines and drugs on the Rational Drug List
            procured before loan signing, but after June 30, 2012. The disbursements of the
            retroactive portion will consist of reimbursing 100% of the procured and paid vaccines
            and drugs paid by JPD as per the Rational Drug List against submitted SOEs. To avoid
            excessive transaction costs, the minimum Withdrawal Application amount for direct
            payment and reimbursement would be set at 20% of the Designated Account ceiling and
            full supporting documents will be limited for contracts above US$ 5,000,000 as follows:
            (i) proof of purchase (purchase order), (ii) certified invoices by JPD, (iii) evidence of
            payment, (iv) and delivery evidence to the Directorate of Purchases and Supplies MOH
            central Warehouse. Reimbursement would be made through a transfer to the Government
            Unified Treasury Account being the Single Treasury Account (STA) at the CBJ in local
            currency. For vaccines and drugs procured by JPD after June 30, 2013, disbursements
            will be made directly from the DA and replenishments will be against SOEs. The same
            requirements of retroactive financing on the minimum value of contracts to be submitted
            to the Bank and respective full supporting documents will apply for prospective
            purchases after June 30, 2013.

            B.    Financing of medical care for Jordanians in non-MOH health facilities. This sub-
            component will finance medical bills of patients referred to the non-MOH hospitals and
                                                          47
       health facilities due to the lack of available beds or services in the public sector. A
       consultancy firm will be contracted to perform technical (medical) and financial audit of
       the list of medical bills of patients referred to the non-MOH hospitals and health facilities
       before payment. A prior clearance of the firm on the list of bills and patients is needed
       before payment. All supporting documents (invoices and related approvals) will be
       retained by MOF for audit purposes after being sent from JPD. Disbursements will be
       made from the DA and replenishments will be against SOEs verified by the consultancy
       firm.

18. Component 2 (Supporting Household Basic Needs). Under this component, the project
will finance the increase in the cost of the bread and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) subsidies.
Retroactive financing of up to US$39 million would be provided to finance the bread and LPG
subsidies for payments made before loan signing date but on or after June 30, 2012 and
prospective financing will be provided up to US$ 40.5million after July 1, 2013. The details of
the increase in bread and LPG subsidies due to the crisis are detailed under project components
section. Retroactive financing would be provided for the bread and LPG subsidies during period
from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013 against submitted SOEs reviewed and approved by the
World Bank task team.

19. In order to finance retroactively the bread and LPG subsidies, acceptable audit reports with
audited financial statements of the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) “Special Trade
Account? and Petroleum Refinery Company (JPRC) – Public Shareholding Company (LLC)
should be submitted to the Bank for year ended December 31, 2012 and the auditor review report
of the quarter ended March 30, 2013. MoIT “Special Trade Account? is solely used to reflect all
financial transactions related to the basic food supplies. This account is annually audited by an
independent audit firm hired by MoIT. Also, JPRC accounts are annually audited by an external
audit firm (a big four audit firm) hired by JPRC based on the requirements of the Companies’
Law and Stock Market regulations. Before retroactively financing bread and LPG share of
subsidies, MOF should confirm the subsidies balances for bread and LPG as reported in audited
financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2012 and the quarterly review report of
March 30, 2013. Reimbursement would be made through a transfer to the Government Unified
Treasury Account at the CBJ.

20. For financing part of the increase in the cost of the bread and LPG cylinder subsidies after
June 30, 2013, disbursements will be made from the DA based on the monthly reports on bread
and LPG subsidies submitted by the MoIT and JPR verified and approved by MOF. The reports
detail the monthly sales volume and will include the increase in sales volume due to the crisis,
costs per unit, and subsidy amount at the end of each month. Replenishments will be against
SOEs reviewed and approved by the World Bank task team, who will review the monthly reports
for the increased cost of bread and LPG.

21. The audit reports of MoIT “Special Trade Account? and JPRC for the year ended December
31, 2011 that was carried out by an independent audit firm contained qualified audit opinions.
The main qualifications of MoIT “Special Trade Account? audit reports relate to the inability of
verifying the existence of fixed assets and ownership of investment in a local company. While,
the main qualifications of JPRC audit report relate to the concession period ending March 2,
2008 and the MOF non- approval of the balances and transactions related to MOF as shown in
the audited financial statements. No material internal control issues were reported by the external
                                                48
auditors that would impact the disbursement of the Project and the examination of the reported
qualification of the audit reports concluded that they are not directly related to subsidies and no
specific implications on the operation are foreseen.

22. E-Disbursement. The World Bank has introduced e-disbursement for all projects in Jordan.
Under e-Disbursement, all transactions will be conducted and associated supporting documents
and IFRs scanned and transmitted online through the World Bank’s Client connection system.
The use of e-Disbursement functionality will streamline online payment processing to (i) avoid
common mistakes in filling out WAs; (ii) reduce the time and cost of sending WAs to the Bank;
and (iii) expedite the Bank processing of disbursement requests.

23. The following specifies the categories of eligible expenditures that may be financed out of
the proceeds of the Loan and the percentage of expenditures to be financed for eligible
expenditures:

             Category                        Amount of the Loan                  Percentage of Expenditures to

                                                                                Section 2.03 of this Agreement

Procurement

24. Given the prevailing impact of the Syrian crisis on Jordan, and urgency of the Project, which
is being prepared and implemented according to paragraph 11 of the World Bank Operational
Policy 10.00, where sub-paragraph 11(b) mentions “Such Projects may be processed under
special procurement arrangements referred to in paragraph 20 of OP 11.00 and may finance a
positive list of goods procured in a manner that satisfies the considerations of economy and
efficiency (including national procurement procedures of the borrower),? the procurement is

26
    Include bracketed withdrawal category ONLY if the Borrower has elected caps and collars AND requested to
finance the premia out of the proceeds of the loan. The amount allocated to this category will be zero until premia is
to be charged.


                                                         49
being processed under paragraph 20 of OP 11.00 “Procurement under Situations of Urgent Need
of Assistance or Capacity Constraints?, where “Simplified Procurement Procedures? may apply.
Procurement activities of this project are limited to medical/ pharmaceutical goods under
component 1, and consultants’ services (audits) under components 3.

25. Procurement by “The Joint Procurement Department? (JPD): The pharmaceutical sector in
Jordan plays a relatively large economic role; it is second only to garments in terms of annual
export revenues. The Government of Jordan (GOJ) considers the sector to be of strategic
importance in its economic development plans. The World Bank has also provided technical
support to the Jordanian pharmaceutical sector. Among other things, the Bank has assisted the
GOJ to develop guidelines for the procurement of drugs and to organize the procurement of
drugs in a more coherent manner. Most pharmaceutical procurement in the kingdom is currently
being handled by a centralized organization called “The Joint Procurement Department? (JPD).

23. JPD began operations in 2004, based on by-law No. 91 of 2002 - Medicines and Medical
Supplies. The objective of the JPD is to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, economy and
transparency of pharmaceutical procurement. JPD’s actual involvement with Procurement started
in 2007 and gradually expanded as: JD 12 Million in 2007, JD 24 Million in 2008, JD 77 Million
in 2009, JD 73 million in 2010, JD 96.5 million in 2011, JD 91 million in 2012, and about JD
120 million planned for 2013.

24. Assessments and reviews conducted on procurement of medical goods in Jordan (including
Assessment of JPD in 2008, OECD-DAC workshop of 2008, HERA (Health Research for
Action) report on the status of the existing JPD procurement procedures in 2009, Jordan
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Sector Review/Study of 2010) along with current assessment
conducted through review of documents at JPD, and interview of its staff, show that JPD is
successfully running annual procedures of drug procurement on behalf of its partner institutions
in Jordan, and based on a Rational Drug List that is updated from time to time as needed,
conducts the procurement of pharmaceutical/medical goods in a transparent, well organised and
sound managed organisation that is successfully dealing with the procedures throughout the
Kingdom.

25. Procurement methods being used by JPD include:

   •   Tendering (National Bidding) is used for most of JPD Procurement
   •   Shopping (RFQ) for small amount, after re tendering, low or no response from bidders.
   •   Direct Purchasing for emergency or single source.

26. Even though procurement opportunities are openly advertised in the JPD website
(www.jpd.gov.jo) and local newspapers which makes them accessible to all, the National
regulations under Jordanian Food and Drug Administration (JFDA) do not allow international
procurement unless foreign companies have a local representation. The current practices do not
promote real, open international competition, resulting in reduced competition and the possibility
of higher costs in comparison to market prices. As a result, despite having a bi-lingual website,
most documents, including advertisements, are only available in Arabic.




                                               50
27. The available Guidelines (also accessible through www.jpd.gov.jo) describe procurement
procedures that are sound and accepted as sufficiently transparent and explicit. The existing JPD
procurement guidelines are written in Arabic. The English translation reflects the original Arabic
version, but needs to be improved.

28. Since the requirement of registration by JFDA is a known requirement in the industry, and
that currently there is no system that would allow foreign companies to bid for unregistered
product except in exceptional cases, many major global pharmaceutical companies and a number
of generic producers, from Europe, India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt and other
countries are represented in Jordan through their locally registered agents which number around
200. Additionally, 16 local manufacturers produce pharmaceuticals in Jordan, which account for
about one third of drugs procured.

29. Tendering procedures followed include:
    • Tender advertisement (Bidding Documents available)
    • Bid submission after at least 4 weeks from advertisement date (Using Special deposit
       Box)
    • Public Bid opening by Tendering Committee including using webcam for online bid
       opening broadcasting.
    • Publishing the opening information on the Website the next day
    • Preparation of Bid technical evaluation report
    • Initial bid award notifications to all bidders and also publishing all the information on the
       website. (4 days for objection to the decision is provided).
    • Final Notification and publication of award after all reports are approved by the tendering
       committee and the Board.

30. Transparency; JPD publishes all the information required by its partners publicly in the
website such as the following, and conducts public bid opening:
    • Legislation (regulation, guidelines & condition).
    • Tender announcement (document, opening minutes, initial award, objections response
       and final award).

31. Considering the urgency of the project (paragraph 20 of OP 11 “Procurement under
Situations of Urgent Need of Assistance or Capacity Constraints?), that the implementation
period is only one year and that there is a well-established procurement practice in place,
procurement of pharmaceutical and medical equipment will be undertaken using the existing JPD
procedures for contracts from US$ 200,000 up to the threshold of US$ 5 million (per contract)
from Rational Drug List (The Positive List of Goods). This procurement approach, based on the
Jordanian Rational Drug List will help prevent delays in supplying the medicines and vaccines
by accessing the many global pharmaceutical companies and generic producers with a presence
(or agency) in Jordan. The only proposed additional mitigation measure is to notify potential
international bidders of packages above US$ 500,000 in UNDB online and the JPD website
(English version).

32. To minimize the number of transactions and required documents, a positive list of goods
(Contracts with estimated cost of US$ 200,000 and above) will be prepared for pharmaceuticals
and vaccines to be procured, that includes items cleared by JFDA. To facilitate disbursement the

                                                51
necessary documents to be provided by the Borrower will be defined as: (i) proof of
advertisement, (ii) proof of purchase (Purchase Order), and (iii) proof of payment to suppliers.

33. Retroactive Financing: JPD procurement practice used to procure goods up to US$5 million
was considered acceptable for retroactive financing from the Rational Drug List (The Positive
List of Goods) under this Project. For the contracts that are eligible for retroactive financing, a
list of contracts with an estimated cost of US$ 200,000 and above up to US$5 million equivalent
will be prepared for pharmaceuticals and vaccines (from the Positive List of Goods) procured,
that includes items cleared by JFDA. To facilitate disbursement, the necessary documents to be
provided by the Borrower will be defined as: (i) proof of advertisement, (ii) proof of purchase
(Purchase Order), and (iii) proof of payment to suppliers.

34. Procurement by Ministry of Finance (MOF): MOF is only responsible for procurement under
Component 3 (Selection of Technical and External Auditors), which are very small contracts, for
which it has sufficient experience and capacity to follow the Bank Guidelines for this task.

Applicable Guidelines

35. JPD will be responsible for the procurement of all project contracts under Component 1
(Provision of vaccines and essential drugs to ensure their adequate and continuous supply at all
public healthcare facilities). The MOF will procure all contracts under Component 3. The
Procurement will be carried out in accordance with the ‘Guidelines On Preventing and
Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and
Grants Dated October 15, 2006 and Revised in January, 2011’, and the “Guidelines: Procurement
of Goods, Works, and Non-Consulting Services under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants?
dated January 2011, and “Guidelines: “Selection and Employment of Consultants under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits and Grants by World Bank Borrowers? dated January 2011, as detailed
below and the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement.

Anti-Corruption Guidelines

36. The Borrower shall ensure that the Project (except for contracts specified in paragraph 39
below) is carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Anti-Corruption Guidelines
mentioned in paragraph 37.

37. The JPD contracts and standard bidding documents do not explicitly contain clauses related
to fraud and corruption, because these contracts are governed by the national anti-corruption
rules providing for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) of
Jordan, an independent agency, in cases of fraud and corruption. Therefore, a waiver of some
provisions of the World Bank Anti-Corruption Guidelines is sought to rely on the Borrower’s
national ACC to investigate cases of fraud and corruption in the use of project funds for the
aforementioned contracts (under US$5 million). The waiver specifically proposes the
modification of paragraph 9 and the deletion of paragraph 10, which currently provide, among
others, for the right of the Bank to inspect accounts, records and all other documents of the
Borrower or other recipients of loan proceeds relating to the Project. These paragraphs will be
substituted with modified provisions stating the obligation of the Borrower to undertake
investigations in case of allegation of fraud and corruption and provide related reports to the
Bank (see Modified Provisions below), therefore all contracts procured or to be procured using
                                                52
JPD procedure up to US$5,000,000 per contract are instead subject to Modified Anti-Corruption
Guidelines, as detailed below.

38. Mitigation Measures. The ACC was legally established in 2006 and strengthened through
legislation passed in 2012. It is a financially and administratively independent commission with
the statutory requirement to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption and is required
subject to criminal charges, to conduct its investigation in full confidentiality and issue a report
with its findings and decisions. The ACC has established itself as a credible and independent
institution. The World Bank is currently supporting the ACC through an IDF grant that aims to
improve the institutional capacity, effectiveness and efficiency of the Commission’s case
management system, and its production of reliable statistics. The legislative strengthening of
ACC was identified as a prior action in the Jordan First Programmatic DPL (2012) and was met
successfully and on time. In light of this recent and ongoing Bank support, regional management
has confidence in ACC’s ability to fulfill its investigatory role and to coordinate effectively and
appropriately with the World Bank should the need arise.
39. The Modified Provisions still safeguard the Bank’s rights in case of fraud and corruption
allegations, such as inter alia, the obligation of the Borrower to report to the Bank the findings of
any such investigation, including making available all documentary and other evidence arising
and allowing the Bank to review relevant books and records and interview relevant persons.
40. In addition, the project puts in place additional technical audit provisions and a financial
verification of the use of loan proceeds. The project will finance the cost of two special purpose
audits, to perform an audit of the funds disbursed under the retroactive financing for drugs and
vaccines. Finally, all other procurement for goods, consultants’ services, and non-consulting
services would be subject to the Bank’s terms, conditions and policies.

41. Furthermore, the Bank has remedies in the event that the Borrower fails to take timely and
appropriate action to investigate material and credible allegations as this would be a performance
failure subject to the Bank’s General Conditions applicable to the Loan Agreement.

Modifications to the Anti-Corruption Guidelines

42. Paragraph 9 is modified to read as follows:

   “9. In furtherance of the above-stated purpose and general principles, the Borrower will:
   (a) Take all appropriate measures to ensure that the Project is carried out in accordance with
   these Guidelines;
   (b) Take all appropriate measures to prevent corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, coercive and
   obstructive practices in connection with the use of Loan proceeds, including (but not limited
   to) (i) adopting appropriate fiduciary and administrative practices and institutional
   arrangements to ensure that the proceeds of the Loan are used only for the purposes for
   which the Loan was granted, and (ii) ensuring that all of its representatives involved with the
   Project, and all recipients of Loan proceeds with which it enters into an agreement related to
   the Project, receive a copy of these Guidelines and are made aware of its contents;



                                                  53
   (c) Immediately report to the Bank any allegations of fraud and corruption in connection with
   the use of Loan proceeds that come to its attention;
   (d) If the Bank determines that any person or entity referred to in (b) above has engaged in
   corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, coercive or obstructive practices in connection with the use of
   Loan proceeds, take timely and appropriate action, satisfactory to the Bank, to address such
   practices when they occur;
   (e) (i) Take timely and appropriate action to investigate all credible and material allegations
   or other indications of fraud and corruption; (ii) promptly, upon the completion of any such
   investigation, report to the Bank the findings thereof, including making available all
   documentary and other evidence arising therefrom, and allow the Bank to review relevant
   books and records and to meet relevant persons; and (iii) if the Borrower or the Bank
   determines that any person or entity has engaged in fraud or corruption in connection with
   the Project, take timely and appropriate action, in accordance with the Borrower’s laws and
   regulations and satisfactory to the Bank, to remedy or otherwise address the situation and
   prevent its recurrence;
   (f) In the event that the Bank declares any recipient of Loan proceeds ineligible as described
   in paragraph 11 below, take all necessary and appropriate action to give full effect to such
   declaration by, among other things, (i) exercising the Borrower’s right to terminate early or
   suspend the agreement between the Borrower and such recipient and/or (ii) seeking
   restitution; and
   (g) Ensure that any person or entity debarred or suspended by the Bank is not awarded a
   contract under or otherwise allowed to participate in the Project during the period of such
   debarment or suspension.?
   Paragraph 10 is deleted in its entirety.
43. Procurement of Works. There are no Work Contracts Planned under the Project.

44. Procurement of Goods. Goods procured or to be procured under this project will include
supply of Medicines and Vaccines using Bank’s Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for all ICB
packages above US$5 million, and using the JPD standard procedure for all packages up to US$5
million.

45. Procurement of Consultants. Consultants to be selected under this project will include
External and Medical Auditors to be selected by MOF based on Bank’s Guidelines using its
standard documents and selection process.

46. Procurement Plan and Procurement Arrangements. The 12-month Procurement Plan
(dated June 5, 2013) for the project has been reviewed and is acceptable to the Bank. This plan
will be updated as needed to reflect the latest circumstances. The Procurement Plan comprises of
Goods and Consultancy Contracts, as indicated below.

Strategy and Approach for Implementation Support

The World Bank’s implementation support to the project will consist of technical, fiduciary
and evaluation assistance as follows:

    1. Technical assistance: The Bank’s policy guidance and advice has been an integral part
       of preparation of the project. The Bank will continue to seek advice internally from the
       networks and regions and global experts outside of the Bank during implementation.
    2. Fiduciary management support: The World Bank team includes fiduciary management
       staff to provide routine supervision of FM and procurement activities. This will include
       review and clearance of the TORs of the accountant, audit firm, and technical
       consultancy firm. The Bank’s fiduciary staff will also provide guidance to the accountant
       at MOF on financial management guidelines, preparation of the first IFRs, compliance
       with the Bank guidelines and other issues as they arise during the implementation.
    3. Monitoring and verification support. The Bank will provide monitoring and
       verification support with respect to drugs procured. The Bank team will provide support
       to MOF and the MOIT to monitor prices of the subsidized products and preparation of
       forecasts of demand generated by influx of Syrian refugees.
