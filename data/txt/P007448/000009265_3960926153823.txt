MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEN4DATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO JAMAICA
FOR AN EDUCATTON PROGRAM PREPARATION
AND STUDENT LOAN PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed US$8.3
million loan to Jamaica is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would
be repayable over a period of 17 years, including 4 years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.       Backgraund.  Sustained development of the Jamaican economy depends
not only on a stable macro-economic environment, sound fiscal management,
and sectoral policies that promote efficiency in the use of available
resources, both public and private. It depends as well on the skills and
capabilities of its people. The expansion and improvement of education
services in Jamaica through appropriate policies of management, finance,
and education program development is a major component of the Government's
economic recovery and development program.
3.       Jamaica possesses a broadly based education system.  Education is
free and compulsory up to 11 years of age (private schools figure only
marginally in the system); promotinn is automatic and access and retention
ratios are high. Net enrollments in primary education (grades 1-6) and in
lower secondary education (grades 7-9), which together comprise the nine-
year basic education program, are currently 97? and 922, respectively, of
the corresponding age groups. Enrollment rates for females are about equal
to those for males. Twc-thirds of the students enrolled in basic education
are at the primary level; the rest are at the lower secondary level.
However, students enrolled at tbe latter level are separated into two
groups: (a) those attending the substandard "all-age" schools where grades
one through nine are offered and who, as they leave school, generally
become part of the unskilled labor force; and (b) those in the junior cycle
(grades 7-9) of the regular secondary schools (grades 7-11/13), who receive
a higher quality education. Two principal institutions of higher education
-- the University of the West Indies (UWI). a regional university of which
the Mona campus is located in Kingston, and the College of Arts, Science
*           and Technology (CAST) -- have experienced enrollment growth at about 5?
p.a. in recent years. For the purpose of assisting post-secondary students
from low-income backgrounds, the Government has provided loan financing for
students through the Students' Loan Bureau (SLB) since 1970.
4.       Despite this relatively favorable situation, the Government faces
major problems in view of sharply declining public resources for education
(28? in real terms since 1983-84). In recognition of these constraints, in
1987 the Government conducted a review of conditions in, among other areas,
education and training, and has drawn uD a comprehensive social sector
strategy to undertake crucial rehabilitation and reforms. This review has
indicated that, in basic education, achievement levels are generally low
and the common entrance examination for secondary education is popularlyv



-2-
viewed as perpetuating an elite secondary system which ignores the
educational and employment needs of the majority of students. The Ministry
of Education's (MOE) program development and evaluation capacity is weak.
In many areas of the country, physical facilities are inadequate, poorly
maintained and, in terms of size, not cost-effective. With respect to
post-secondary education, in the absence of cost-recovery, the Government
has been able to preserre its colleges and universities only by neglecting
badly needed pr -P'y and secondary school investments.  In recognition of
this dilemma, tn_= Government has recently terminated boarding grants and
introduced selective fees in higher education. The SLB has suffered from
poor administrative and financial practices, although, in preparation for
the proposed project, man4gement and procedures of the SLB have already
been strengthened. The SLB has been reorganized in line with consultant's
recommendations; a new director and staff are in place; improved
procedural guidelines for loan appraisal, disbursement, and collection have
been developed; and a long-standing policy permitting the SLB to recover
from the Government accounts in arrears for over 90 days was abolished at
the end of 1986 in an attempt to increase the efficiency of SLB operations
and the effectiveness of collection procedures.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The World Bank has taken a lead
role in assisting the Government of Jamaica to formulate and implement an
economic adjustment program. A complementary Bank role in the social
sectors, particularly those services reaching the majority of the
population, is justified not only to help the Government mitigate the
soc al cost of adjustment, but also to increase Jamaica's long-term
economic viability. The Bank's sector development strategy for education
emphasizes cost-effective measures for qualitative development of basic
education, further rationalization and consolidation of secondary
educatici, including job training, and assistance for post-secondary
education that would be financed by a combination of increased cost-
recovery and targeted subsidies for capable students from poorer families.
The Bank has supported three education projects in Jamaica focussed largely
on secondary and vocational education, and teacher training. Despite
implementation delays related to lack of counterpart financing and staff
turnover, project objectives have been largely met in each case. The
proposed project would complement Bank assistance under the Administrative
Reform Program (ARP, Loan 2423-JM), and the Second Technical Assistance
Project (Loan 2507-JM) that are strengthening personnel and financial
management within MOE.
6.       ProJect Objectives.  The first objective of the project is to
assist the Government to prepare and evaluate options for an education
rehabilitation and development program aimed primarily at the first nine
grades, especially grades 7 through 9. The second objective is to
strengthen the student loan program for higher education by substantially
improving its collection performance and overall administration.
7.       Prcject Description.  The proposed project would assist the MOE
through: (a) preparation of studies on organizational and financing
alternatives that would cover: (i) Jamaica's current educational needs and
priorities in basic education, with particular reference to lower secondary
education; (ii) alternative policy actions and their estimated costs; and
(iii) those policy actions recommended on the basis of cost-effectiveness
and educational criteria; (b) experimentation with some solutions to the



3 -
issue of all-age schools, through: (i) the development of software (e.g.,
revised curriculum, student evaluation procedures, and teacher training
program) for lower secondary education; (ii) pilot consolidation of small
all-age schools in two parishes into more efficient school sizes and
incorporation of students in the lower secondary grades of these schools
into the regular system; and (iii) the organization of community-based
school maintenance committees; (c) training of key MOE personnel for
research and planning; and (d) formulation of a basic education development
plan and investment program. The rroject provides fuinds for technical
assistance and studies (US$2.3 million), and for construction, renovation,
furniture and equipment (US$5.3 million) to support these components. In
view of recent reduction of student subsidies in higher education, the
proposed project would also assist the SLB to finance student loans and to
introduce reforms to improve SLB performance and capacity to respond to an
expected increase in volume of loans (US$3.5 million). Computer equipment
would be purchased for the SLB management information system and a study
carried out to improve student selection criteria and develop equitable
financing conditions. The relevant project components would be managed and
monitored by the MOE and the SLB. The existing project implementation unit
in MOE would be strengthened through the recruitment of a coordinator and
an educator. With these additions, supported by consultants, as
appropriate, MOE and SLB have adequate capacity to implement the project
which would be carried out over three and one-half years. The total cost
of the project is estimated at US$11.1 million, with a foreign exchange
component of US$4.1 million (36.9Z). Breakdowns of costs and financing are
shown in Schedule A, and amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Jamaica are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No.6933-JM, dated December 1, 1987, is attached.
8.       Agreed Actions.  Witt. respect to the MOE component,  the
Government has agreed on the following actions: (a) establishment and
maintenance throughout the implementation period of both a technical
advisory committee and a high level review committee to assist in
preparation and review of the studies, respectively, and to assure
appropriate linkages into policy formulation and resource allocation; and
(b) informing the Ban'., not later than June 30, 1990, of the initial
findings of the studies, and presenting to the Bank for review, not later
than December 31, 1990, a basic education development plan and investment
program that would take into account the conclusions and alternatives
proposed in the studies. For the SLB component, the Government has agreed
on a Plan of Action, to be reviewed annually with the Bank, covering: (a)
on-lending terms and conditions (including agreed institutional and
needs-based student eligibility criteria and maintaining interest rates
positive in re.l terms); and (b) procedures for the improvement of loan
administration and recovery (including retaining the services of collection
agencies en a commission basis and adoption of such legislative or
administrative measures as are necessary fully to implement the
procedures). As conditions of loan effectiveness, in addition to having
established the technical committee and the review committee, the
Government will have appointed key personnel, and designed satisfactory
contractual agreements with the SLB and the Estate Development Company
(which will manage civil works).

9.       Benefits.  The main contributio.s of the project would be to
finance the design and testing of economically sound development strategies
for basic education and promote more equitable financing of higher
education. In particular, it would help develop co*t-effective solutions
to problems faced by the all-age schools, namely, lcw student achievement,
ineffective teacher training, inadequate physical environment, and poorly
designed curriculum. It would also provide resources to improve the MOE
and SLB planning, managerial, and operational capabilities. In addition,
by introducing measures to improve the economic performance of the SiB, it
would strengthen Government's plans to increase cost-recovery and improve
equity in higher education. All these actions are essential elements in
supporting long-term rehabilitation and reform proposed by the Government
for the education sector.
10.      Risks.  The main project risk is that the education strategy and
program to be prepared on the basis of studies and technical assistance
financed under the project may not be adopted. This risk is minimized by
the strong commitment of the Government to improving the sector, as
symbolized in its social sector strategy. In addition, the project is part
of the medium-term development strategy agreed with the Bank, and the pilot
demonstration and studies should assist the Government LO prepare a high
quality investment program for basic education to be financed from both
domestic and international sources. A secondary risk in the student loan
component is that the reduction of student subsidies and other cost-
recovery measures introduced at the post-secondary level may be suspended
or that student loan collection targets may not be achieved. However, the
Government is highly committed to increasing efficiency and raising
productivity in education. It is also committed to a set of actions to
continue improving the collections record. Many of the improved
collections policies are already being implemented, and monthly monitoring
will provide early warning of difficulty. Project covenants and progres-'
indicators have also been designed to give timely signals in case progiam
objectives and government actions di,verge, and an active supervision plan
will be followed.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
