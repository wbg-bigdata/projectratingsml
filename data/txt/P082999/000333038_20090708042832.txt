    2. Introductory Statement

This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Regional Vice President to introduce the
following changes in the Tunisia Education Quality Improvement Program Phase 2 (Loan
no. 7220-TUN, P082999), namely to extend the closing date from June 30, 2008 to
September 30, 2009 and to reallocate funds from the civil works and consulting services
categories into goods. During the supervision mission in September 2007, and the Sector
Manager's visit in April 2008, the Bank discussed this request with the Government.
After reviewing the revised implementation documentation and the proposed reallocation
of funds, which represent more than 5% of the original loan amount, the Bank's team
made a detailed assessment to estimate the timeframe needed to complete the
implementation of the project activities and carry out the procurement plan. Based on
this assessment, it was estimated that an extension of 15 months will be needed to
complete all remaining Project activities (civil works component, equipment purchases
and training activities). This request was confirmed by the Government during the
supervision mission conducted on May 20-30, 2008. The Bank's team assessment
confirms that the implementation schedule and procurement plan are feasible within this
timeframe.

The proposed reallocation of Funds is consistent with the current completion rate of
activities, and Project savings. Some activities initially planned to be funded under the
loan have been carried out using the Borrower's own resources, leaving room for funding
additional equipment under the loan. The actual costs of the civil works component have
been lower than the estimated costs at the time of project preparation, and savings have
been made due to appreciation of the Euro against the Dollar and Dinar in which
construction expenses are made. The proposed reallocation does not imply changes in
the components of the project, nor in the activities to be carried out by the project. The
new allocations reflect the need to increase the scale of the ICT program and hence the
need to increase the number of schools to be equipped with computers. Along the same
lines, in order to fully implement the language program in schools, the equipment of
language labs at the school level was deemed necessary.


    3. Background and Reasons for Restructuring

The project was approved on March 8, 2004 and became effective on May 24, 2004. The
Project Development Objective of PAQSET II is to promote excellence in teaching and
learning throughout the school system and provide equitable access and opportunities for
post-basic education. Progress against this objective is measured by enrollment and
completion rates, disaggregated by gender. Important progress has been made towards
reaching these goals, particularly in enrollment, where it has reached 97.4% for girls and
97.3% for boys in primary and 91.1% for girls and 90% for boys in lower secondary.
Completion rates have also shown important progress, particularly in primary for both
girls (88.4%) and boys (82.5%). There are still some challenges in particular in the
repetition and dropout rates observed in secondary education. The government is
following up closely on these observations, and is in the process of conducting a study to
evaluate the reasons that prompt youngsters to abandon or fail in school. Intermediate



                                            2

objectives, each associated with a project component have been making progress as well.
A detailed evolution of these indicators is found in Annex 2.

Although the project is scheduled to close in June 2008, there are 38 million Euros, from
a total loan amount of 104 million Euros that will be committed in the upcoming months.
Given the short time frame to complete the project, the government has requested an
extension period in order to complete all the planned activities. The supervision mission
conducted in September 2007 made specific recommendations to improve and accelerate
the implementation, in particular in project management and coordination, procurement
and financial management and reporting. The May 2008 mission confirmed that the
Ministry of Education has taken action on the recommendations and the pace of
implementation has improved.

Project Implementation

After the September 2007 mission, the Monitoring and Evaluation was downgraded to
Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) because the recommendations made at the mid-term
review on how to monitor and report progress on implementation of activities, including
school rehabilitation, were not followed.

During the May 2008 mission, progress made on all monitoring indicators was fully
discussed with Ministry of Education officials. It was also agreed that in order to monitor
progress made on equity, indicators on repetition and dropout rates for the schools
operating in underserved areas (PEP Schools) will be reported and monitored until the
project closing date. In addition, enrollments of handicapped children in basic schools,
and in pre-school in rural areas will also be reported. From the analysis of these
indicators it can be observed that important progress has been made on providing equal
opportunities for children under special circumstances. Based on the recommendations on
reporting and monitoring project indicators, the M&E will be upgraded to satisfactory in
the upcoming ISR.

The last ISR dated November 2, 2007 rated the Implementation Progress (IP) moderately
unsatisfactory due to the following reasons:

         a) Procurement management continued to experience severe delays. Although
         some problems related to the practice of procurement processes had been
         resolved since the mid-term review showing some efficiency with regards to the
         procurement of goods, the lack of proper project coordination between different
         agencies was identified as a major cause of delays in terms of the selection of
         consultants.
         b)   The Project Coordinator had been assigned to a different institution, and the
         coordination function has not been assigned to a relevant unit/person within the
         Ministry of Education and Training (MET).

The above delays on procurement and implementation of some of the project activities
were discussed with the Government authorities during the September 2007 mission, and
the procurement plan was revised according to the project's constraints. These issues
were brought to the attention of the Minister of Education and Training. The Bank team
was informed of the measures taken by the Government to improve the implementation


                                              3

of the project, which include the establishment of a Project Management Unit in the
Ministry that will follow the implementation of PAQSET II, with a Project Director, as
described in Schedule 5 of the Loan agreement. This decision was translated in a
Presidential Decree signed and published on August 31, 2007, and provided the Bank
team with the assurance that the implementation of this project would improve. For the
extension period, the Project implementation modalities remain the same as described in
Schedule 5 of the Loan agreement.

The May 2008 mission observed that the Ministry of Education and Training has made
efforts in the past few months to accelerate the procurement processing, has recruited a
new person responsible for procurement of consulting services, was appointed a project
coordinator, and is in the final stages of appointing a Director for the Project
Management Unit. The assessment of the mission is that the revised procurement plan is
consistent with the requested extension period and the present capacity of the Ministry.

Given the progress made, the IP will be upgraded to Satisfactory in the next ISR to be
filed before June 30, 2008.

Cancellation of the ongoing bidding processes

Within the request for extension, On February 21, 2008, the Borrower raised the need to
further focus on increasing the scale of ICT and language laboratories. As a consequence,
the Borrower proposed to cancel three ongoing bidding processes aiming at acquiring
science laboratory equipment in order to reallocate funds to the acquisition of ICT and
language laboratory equipment. The revised procurement plan includes the two new
bidding processes.

Based on the fact that the change of priorities of the Ministry of Education has caused a
change in the procurement needs of the Borrower in this sector and based on the fact that
these changes do not affect the Project's development objective, the cancellation of the
three ongoing bidding processes have been found acceptable by the Bank.

Financial Audit

After the September 2007 mission, the Financial Management was upgraded to
satisfactory as, the reports presented using the software required by the Bank were of
very good quality and following all Bank requirements. The audit is current and
unqualified.

    4. Proposed Changes

The proposed changes are to extend the closing date for the first time from June 30, 2008
to September 30, 2009 and to reallocate funds as follows:

    5. Analysis

The extension of the closing date and the reallocation of loan proceeds will not have any
major effect on the original economic, financial, technical, institutional or social aspects
of the project as appraised. The environmental category will remain unchanged and no
exceptions to Bank rules are sought.

The Borrower has prepared an action plan containing the new disbursement forecast and
a revised procurement plan (both attached as annexes 3 and 4).


    6. Expected Outcomes

The proposed changes will not affect the project's development objective. Annex 1
contains the detailed key performance indicators at their target values until present


    7. Benefits and Risks

There are no risks that would jeopardize the achievement of the restructured project's
development or outcome targets.
