3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
             The overall original objective of the Ukraine Ozone Depleting Substance Phase Out Project
             (the Project) was to assist Ukraine in the rapid phase out of ODS consumption, in a manner
             consistent with international efforts and within internationally agreed timeframes.

             The Project's more specific objectives were to:

              (i)   assist high consumption enterprises in Ukraine to make the transition to non-ODS
                    substitutes before ODS supplies diminish;
              (ii)  provide technical assistance for phase out in the halon sector;
              (iii) provide technology transfer associated with low Global Warming Potential (GWP)
                    refrigerants for domestic refrigeration; and
   (iv) provide institutional strengthening to the Ozone Office within MEPNS and MEP.

             Assessment of the Objectives

             The origin of the Project was the international community's recognition of the difficulty that
             the Countries with Economies in Transition (CEITs) in Eastern Europe and the Former
             Soviet Union (FSU) would have in meeting their obligations under the 1990 London
             Amendment to the Montreal Protocol (MP), namely the elimination of Annex A and B
             Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) consumption and production by December 31, 1996
             Phase Out date for all Annex A and B ODS except carbontetracloride (CTC) under the
             1992 Copenhagen Adjustment. To address this, the the Global Environmental Facility
             (GEF) formally opened an Ozone Focal Area in 1995 for CEITs who had Country Programs
             endorsed by the Parties to the MP, and had ratified the London Amendment. As a GEF
             Implementing Agency (IA), the Bank has undertaken a number of successful GEF ODS
             Focal Area operations in eligible countries in the region.

             Ukraine was the last of these countries, having adopted a Country Program Developed with
             Danish Bilateral assistance in October 1996, and ratified the London Amendment in
             February 1997. Among the CEITs in the region, the Ukraine was considered among the
             largest consumers of ODS. In 1991, annual consumption of Annex A and B ODS in Ukraine
             was estimated to be 7,061 MT but by 1994 actual consumption had fallen to 3,310 MT and
             was reported to be 1,470 MT ODP in 1996 and 1,780 MT ODP in 1997 Consumption
             occurred in the refrigeration, aerosol, solvent sectors and fire protection sectors.

             At a general level, the Project's overall objective adequately defines what the Project was
             intended to accomplish within the context of international and national priorities prevailing
             at the time. It was intended to be a comprehensive country consumption phase out of
             Annex A and B ODS such that Ukraine achieved compliance with the London Amendment
             phase out requirements by January 1, 2000, a date that was initially accepted by the Parties
             to the Montreal Protocol for non-compliant CEITs.               The specific objectives also
             appropriately amplify the overall objective and proactively reflect the GEF priority related to
             promotion of low GWP ODS substitutes that was emerging at the time.

   However, this assessment should be qualified in relation to some of the original assumptions that
   underpinned the objective, mainly in terms of how realistic it was to meet the targeted date for London
   Amendment compliance.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The Project's objectives were never formally revised and essentially remained as originally stated
throughout its implementation. However, the phase out compliance date effectively changed when
Ukraine was granted a further extension to December 31, 2002 for correction of its non-compliance
status ( "UNEP/OzL.Pro/ImpCom/21/3, Decision X/27(h). - Compliance with the Montreal Protocol by



                                                    - 2 -

Ukraine" Minutes of the Implementation Committee under Non-Compliance for the Montreal Protocol,
Twenty-first meeting Cairo, 16 November 1998). Revisions to the scope and GEF Work Program were
initiated during implementation to place greater emphasis on investment initiatives in the refrigeration
servicing and fire protection sectors were made to better address economic and social impacts
associated with phase out, particularly in light of the rapid closure of traditional ODS suppliers in Russia
in 2000.

    The two additional one-year extensions in 2002 and 2003, granted by the Bank were essentially
    related to the expanded work program and project scope as well as accommodating slow
    implementation of problematic sub-projects. More specifically, the requested extensions were to allow
    (a) orderly completion of the original work program, in particular with respect to two large and
    technically complex sub-projects in aerosol sub-sector, and (b) implementation of additional reserve
    sub-projects, requested by the government as a matter of priority in refrigeration servicing and fire
    safety sub-sectors. It should be noted that while original project development objectives were
    effectively achieved by the end of the first extension period, the further extensions allowed
    significantly expand project's positive social impact through provision of better quality services to poor
    segments of population and establishment of the operational system of reclaim and recovery of
    halons in the area of public fire safety.

3.3 Original Components:
The project design involved three components: investment sub-projects, technical assistance, and
support for the project implementation unit (PIU) within the local Implementing Agency. The overall
Project received GEF Council approval in May 1998 (Global Environment Facility, Ukraine Ozone
Depleting Substances Phase-out Project, Project Document, The World Bank, Report No. 17211-UA,
May 1998) and Board approval in June 1998. The following provides a brief description of the three
components as originally approved:

               a) Investment Component: This component involved a portfolio of eight (8) appraised
               enterprise specific investment sub-projects plus a framework sub-project covering the
               refrigeration servicing sector.   The initial portfolio consisted of two sub-projects in the
               consumer aerosol sector, one enterprise in the domestic refrigeration sector, four
               enterprises in the commercial/industrial refrigeration sector, and one enterprise in the
               solvent sector, plus two pilot sub-projects for the recovery and recycling of ODS refrigerant


               b) Technical Assistance: The technical assistance (TA) component was intended to
               strengthen country institutional capacity for management of ODS phase out and eventual
               elimination within MEP's Ozone Office, undertake a specific initiative related to the transfer
               of hydrocarbon refrigerant technology to JSC "NORD" for domestic refrigerator
               manufacture, development of a halon management plan and associated implementation
               capacity within the national fire protection service, and support the implementation Project's
               investment component with respect to safety audits and external procurement management
               capacity.

    c)   PIU (Ozone Office) Support Component: In accordance with GEF practice, this component
    supported the operation of the PIU inclusive of staffing required for project supervision, procurement
    administration, and financial management at a level of 3 % of the grant

3.4 Revised Components:
               Throughout the Project the components remained the same. However, the investment
               component was expanded and adjustment in the scope of the technical assistance and PIU
               (Ozone Office) support components as originally defined was made. This is described as
               follows:

               a) Investment Component: The original investment portfolio was maintained with the



                                                      - 3 -

  exception of one cancelled sub-project within the commercial refrigeration sector
  (Odessaholodmash).       Resources available from procurement savings, transfers from
  underutilized technical assistance resources and the sub-project cancellation allowed an
  additional five refrigeration servicing sub-projects and a halon reclaim and recycling
  sub-project to be included.          These additions provided the capability for a more
  comprehensive national phase out of residual ODS use and better addressed economic
  and social impact associated with the elimination of ODS in these sectors.

  b) Technical Assistance: Over the course of Project implementation it became apparent
  that various local institutional barriers related to procurement and taxation would preclude
  effective use of the available technical assistance resources, particularly for institutional
  strengthening. These resources were transferred either to the Investment Component or to
  the Ozone Office support component.

  c) PIU (Ozone Office) Support Component: In successive work program and annual budget
  approvals, resources to for Ozone Office were increased, mainly to support local individual
  consultants and consulting firms employed within the MER structure. This replaced much of
  the originally planned technical assistance in that it provided project implementation
  support as well as undertaking supplementary investment sub-project preparation, and
  institutional strengthening.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
   The Project's overall quality of entry is rated is satisfactory, although it did not recognize the
   implementation issues associated with the TA component and optimistic expectation of meeting the
   original phase out compliance date. This assessment is based on the Project being able to complete
   the required comprehensive phase out, the basis for which was underpinned by the effective use of
   bilateral assistance which provided the basic Country Program framework and a GEF PDF-B grant of
   US$340,000 (the PDF-B grant in the amount of US$340,000 with co-financing of US$38,000 ($30,000
   from enterprises and US$8,000 from the Government of Ukraine) was approved by the GEF CEO on
   May 14, 1996, and by the Bank on July 15, 1996, and was completed on September 1, 1997). This
   allowed comprehensive identification of a candidate investment portfolio and detailed sub-project
   preparation and financial viability assessment prior to appraisal. No formalized link was made with a
   CAS at the time of entry. However, the Project was consistent with the Bank and Government's stated
   priority of addressing key global environmental issues, and facilitating the Government's participation
   in and compliance with global environment conventions. This has become and remains a basic part
   of the CAS. In terms of safeguard policies, the Bank's Operational Policy 4.01 "Environmental
   Assessment" is the main one applicable and the Project's overall objective is consistent with it.
   Recognizing that individual sub-project implementation could have environmental impacts, all were
   subject to environmental assessment consistent with the Category B rating assigned to the overall
   project and were subject to the environmental assessment/expertise review process required under
   Ukrainian legislation during implementation. The main environmental issue identified at entry was the
   use of flammable and explosive hydrocarbon ODS substitutes in the aerosol and refrigeration sectors.
   This was to be addressed by applying design review and formal safety audits by international experts
   of all affected investment sub-projects as a condition of eligibility.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
            Assist Ukraine in the Rapid Phase Out of ODS Consumption, in a Manner Consistent with
            International Efforts and within Internationally Agreed Timeframes: The Project's outcome
            respecting the overall objective of effective phase out of Annex A and B ODS consumption
            consistent with international expectations is evaluated as satisfactory.       Ukraine was in
            substantial compliance with its obligations under the London Amendment by December 31,
            2001 which was the revised target set by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol for rectifying
            its previous non-compliance status. The ODS phased out achieved was 4,580 MT based on
            appraised consumption, 1,238 MT based on the year of project implementation and 533 MT
            based on the last year of ODS use. This covered virtually all the primary Annex A and B
            ODS consumption identified in Ukraine at the time of project implementation as well as a
            substantial portion of the residual ODS consumption in the refrigeration servicing sector. In
            making this assessment it is noted that this was two years later than originally targeted
            (December 31, 1999) when the Project was approved, consequently the objective of rapid
            the phase out was not fully met. However, the impact of this delay on the level of ODS
            consumption was limited and the main consumer at the time of Project initiation (JSC
            "NORD") did in fact very rapidly implement its sub-project.

            Assist High Consumption Enterprises in Ukraine to make the Transition to Non-ODS
            Substitutes before ODS Supplies Diminish: The Project satisfactorily achieved this
            objective, specifically through providing the means for           conversion to internationally
            accepted ODS substitute technologies in the high consumption refrigeration and aerosol
            sectors as well as the only known viable ODS solvent consumer.               In all cases the
            technology supplied allows the respective enterprises to remain in business recognizing
            that the traditional sources of supply from Russia were terminated at the end of 2000 when
            these production facilities closed and Russia implemented an export ban. NORD,
            Dnipro-MTO, and Electronmash took full advantage of GEF funding to implement
            alternative technology in a timely manner to effectively avoid either termination or
            substantial reduction in production from 2001 onwards. However, the other enterprises
            including the nominally high consumption aerosol enterprises were less decisive in
            capitalizing on the opportunity to do so and to avoid production interruption.            As a
            consequence, some uncertainty exists as to the long term sustainability of these
            enterprises, particularly the two aerosol manufacturers involved in the project.

            Provide Technical Assistance for Phase Out in the Halon Sector: The GEF funded TA for
            development of the Halon Management Plan and capacity strengthening within the fire
            protection service satisfactorily met this objective in that the country has the institutional
            and technical capacity to ensure responsible management of halon stocks in the near term
            while maintaining the integrity of critical fire protection systems. Furthermore, this work was
            expanded into the development of a modern halon recovery and recycling capability
            through an additional investment sub-project. While the operational effectiveness of this
            capability has yet to be fully realized, the country should be as well equipped as any
            country in the region to ultimately complete phase out in this sector without additional
            assistance.

            Provide Technology Transfer Associated with Low GWP Refrigerants for Domestic
            Refrigeration: The GEF funding of technology transfer for the conversion of NORD to low
            GWP hydrocarbon refrigerant has had a highly satisfactory result. The enterprise rapidly
            implemented the results of this assistance to the point where its full product range is offered
            to both domestic and export markets using this technology, something that allows full
            access to the European market. This is largely the result of highly committed, market
            oriented enterprise which recognized the trends in their business and were prepared to
            co-finance the GEF contributions in a timely manner.

             Provide Institutional Strengthening to the Ozone Office within MEPNS and MEP: Overall,
             outcomes against this objective are marginally satisfactory. The project was successful in
             stimulating the creation of a dedicated capability within MEP for the regulatory
             management of ODS through direct financial support of the Ozone Office. This has resulted
             in the development of the necessary regulatory framework for ODS control, including
             licensing of ODS use and control of import and export, although questions remain
             respecting the level of enforcement that exists to support these measures. In addition,
             Ukraine has generally improved its compliance with international reporting obligations
             although recent experience in developing a follow on project covering methyl bromide
             shows that this requires further strengthening. The country has also extended its Montreal
             Protocol obligations through ratification of the Copenhagen Amendment in 2000 although
             has not yet proceeded with ratification of latter amendments.

              Address Economic and Social Impacts Associated with Phase Out: The Project's outcome
              against this objective is judged as satisfactory, having substantively mitigated the
              economic and social impacts of ODS phase out and in fact provided benefits in this area. It
              is likely that few if any of the major ODS consumers financed under the Project would have
              been sustainable in the absence of the Project. Having no access to legal ODS supplies
              and the high cost of any other sources would have effectively rendered their old technology
              uncompetitive. This would have resulted in substantial employment reductions and
              associated local economic impacts as well as increasing import reliance for the country as
              a whole. The Project was expanded to provide an effective national capability for the
              recovery and recycling of refrigerant, something that significantly mitigates social and
              economic impacts potentially felt in the food distribution system. Similarly, a significant
              contribution to maintenance of public and property protection should result from the halon
              sector initiatives allowing a gradual transition of fire protection systems.

4.2 Outputs by components:
             Investment Component: The outputs from the investment component are assessed as
             satisfactory in terms of meeting their basic objective eliminating ODS consumption and
             implementing modern substitute technologies. Only one of the original nine investment
             sub-projects that were identified and appraised was not completed and was cancelled prior
             to the commitment of financial resources on viability grounds. However, five additional
             investment sub-projects were added to the component during implementation and three of
             which have been successfully completed and the remaining two, while incomplete, have
             reasonable near term prospects of being completed, assuming appropriate action by the
             Government.       The overall phase out achieved effectively eliminated all primary ODS
             consumption in the country, leaving only a modest and declining residual demand primarily
             in the refrigeration servicing sector which should be significantly reduced by the recovery
             and recycling capacity provided under the Project. At an individual sub-project level, the
             outputs did vary. Highly satisfactory results for the largest sub-project undertaken at JSC
             "Nord" and for the DNKServis refrigeration servicing sub-project were achieved, while
             several sub-projects were considered unsatisfactory.             However, the majority of the
             sub-projects were considered satisfactory despite implementation delays.

             Technical Assistance Component: In general the outputs from this component are
             considered marginally satisfactory. The following provides an assessment of TA outputs is
             done for each of the general categories of activities supported by the Project:

             i)     NORD Isobutane Technology Transfer: The technical assistance supporting the
                    transfer of hydrocarbon refrigerant technology to NORD for domestic refrigerators
                    resulted in the development and now effective conversion of the enterprise's product
                    line to state of the art low GWP refrigerant. This represents a highly satisfactory result
                    and represents a model of for such technology transfer initiatives.




                                                     - 7 -

              ii)    Halon Management Plan and Demonstration Capacity: The TA resources directed to
                     and administered by the Ukrainian Fire Safety Research Institute resulted in a needed
                     upgrading of capacity to regulate and manage halon stocks at a national level and
                     most significantly the development of a comprehensive National Halon Management
                     Plan that was adopted.

              iii)   Institutional Strengthening: The outputs from this TA sub-component were generally
                     unsatisfactory, noting that the contemplated institutional TA not undertaken in this
                     component is partially compensated for by the use of unused TA resources within the
                     PIU support component. The outputs from the international safety audits undertaken
                     at three sub-projects were less than satisfactory and ultimately had to be repeated by
                     the Bank project team in two cases to ensure eligibility conditionality of the GEF were
                     met.

   PIU (Ozone Office) Support Component: The Ozone Office and the PIU operation within it that
   supported the Project is judged as having developed a satisfactory capability in implementing such
   projects. The investment sub-project component was successfully completed albeit with significant
   delays where enterprises required more timely external support in developing technical specifications
   and procurement documents. Ultimately, in many cases, this support had to be provided by the Bank
   team in cooperation with the PIU. The financial management capacity was judged as being excellent
   in terms of collection and reporting of commitment and disbursement information. In assessing the
   PIU's outputs, it should also be noted that overall performance declined in the last two years of the
   project largely due the reduction in contracted staff, despite the granting of extensions and increased
   PIU budgets. The institutional outputs of the Ozone Office itself were generally satisfactory in that
   over the period of the Project the basic regulatory framework necessary to manage ODS was created,
   a modest public information program was mounted, the Country Program was updated, the Ukraine
   ratified the latter Copenhagen Amendment to the Montreal Protocol and it initiated technical
   preparation of a follow up GEF project on MBr phase out.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
              An economic analysis was not performed on the Project as this has not been the practice
              for projects of this type given the difficulty in quantifying the positive economic impact from
              global reduction in ozone depletion and resulting health and climate change impacts.
              However, it is apparent that the project would also have had significant local and national
              positive economic impacts through modernization of a significant number of manufacturing
              and service enterprises such that they are sustainable when they would otherwise likely
              have disappeared.

              A further measure of economic performance is provided by the grant cost effectiveness
              (CE) as measured in US$/Kg ODP. The overall GEF grant CE of the Project's ODS
              consumption related investment was US$18.75/Kg ODP based on ODS consumption in the
              year in which the sub-projects were implemented which compares to US$5.07/Kg ODP
              based on appraised consumption or US$43.56 based on the final year of ODS use prior
              conversion. Table 2 summarizes the appraised and actual CE's for each investment
              sub-project. In general the actual CE based on the original phase out impact was similar to
              that on which the sub-project was approved but worse based on the last year of ODS use.
              This generally reflects the continued production decline of the enterprises after appraisal
              and in a number of cases, notably JSC "NORD", implementation of transitional measures to
              reduce ODS consumption in advance of the sub-project's implementation.                     Late
              completing sub-projects, notably the aerosol sub-projects effectively when out of business
              after ODS supplies ceased to be legally available. Table 3 below compares this against
              other Bank GEF ODS projects in the region. Ukraine would rank as being among the least
              cost effective in the region, something that is largely attributable to implementation delays
              and the economic decline of beneficiaries immediately prior to and during implementation.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
   Consistent with practice for projects of this type, no FRR was performed on the Project. However, a

   financial viability assessment was performed on each enterprises proposing investment sub-projects
   through the screening, preparation and appraisal process. The financial position of beneficiary
   enterprises was monitored during implementation, specifically during the annual audit process. In
   general, it was concluded that this process was effective in ensuring that both comprehensive phase
   out was achieved while directing available funds to viable enterprises. As an example one sub-project
   for which a sub-grant agreement was signed was cancelled prior to disbursing funds on the grounds of
   financial viability. A significant number of potential beneficiaries that would not have survived
   transition to the market economy were eliminated before GEF financing was committed. At closing, of
   the fifteen investment sub-projects implemented, two are considered at some risk due to the
   enterprises potentially not being sustainable. The remaining enterprises all appear to have viable and
   sustainable businesses.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
   The Project has supported the development of the basic regulatory and institutional tools to allow
   Ukraine to move forward with future ODS management, consistent with international expectations and
   standards. A permanent structure to do this is nominally operational within the State Ecological
   Inspectorate of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. In the current post presidential election
   period, this is anticipated to be sustained and hopefully enhanced as a more European oriented
   national environmental policy evolves. Similarly, an overall institutional mechanism, namely the
   Interagency Commission for Montreal Protocol Fulfillment (IAC) exists. While this appeared to have
   had a minimal role during Project implementation it has recently been reactivated and its operation
   would improve internal communication and coordination on ODS issues with the Government. In
   general, the impacts of the Project are assessed as modest in this area, largely on the basis of the
   limited resources available to sustain the Government's continued commitment to ODS issues and
   the limited enforcement capacity currently supporting the available regulatory framework. The
   Project's long term impact on institutional development is dependant on the policies of the new
   government and the priority it attaches to global issues generally and ODS in particular.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
   The one external factor affecting project implementation and outcomes that was to some degree
   outside the government or local implementing agency's control was the overall evolution of the
   country's industrial sector generally during the period of implementation. Market driven restructuring
   over the Project's life cycle had mixed impacts on the viability and stability of ODS consumers and
   Project beneficiaries in particular. In general it may have been a factor in slowing implementation as
   ownership and enterprise priorities evolved in some cases such as REFMA and Kharkivholodmash,
   but except for the one cancelled appraised sub-project (Odessaholodmash) it did not result in the
   sub-project's not ultimately being successfully implemented. In fact, the ownership consolidation of
   the two aerosol sub-projects early in implementation likely saved these sub-projects from failing,
   notwithstanding the subsequent modest implementation performance. Similarly, the full privatization
   of a number of refrigeration servicing enterprises and Dnipro-MTO were likely factors in their
   successful implementation.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
   A number of factors that did impact Project implementation and outcomes were clearly within the
   Government's control. The first was the Government's late initiation of the Project and subsequently
   the extended period between the negotiation of the grant agreement and its effectiveness. This was
   the principle factor in Ukraine being the last major ODS consuming country in the region to meet its
   London Amendment obligations. Once the Project was under implementation on-going administrative
   delays were encountered with such things as customs clearances and local tax administration despite
   the Grant Agreement making explicit provision for VAT and import duty exemptions. Finally, the
   limited resources available to the local implementing agency, particularly for implementation and
   enforcement of the regulatory framework governing ODS from the government have been a
   significant factor in the modest outcomes and concern about sustainability associated with the
   Project's institutional strengthening objectives. All of the above factors are generally characteristic of



                                                     - 11 -

   the weak institutional capacity found in Ukraine during this period as experienced by many Bank
   projects. Comparatively, the fact that the project did achieve its objectives and was ultimately
   successfully implemented within this environment should be seen as positive and in the context of
   Ukraine a significant achievement.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
   The principal factor impacting project performance within the control of the local implementing agency
   was the general administrative inefficiencies within the Ministry which in turn were a direct cause of
   implementation delays. This is in part attributable to the high turn over of senior Ministry people,
   including Ministers themselves which resulted in the absence of any high level continuity in
   championing the Project. This, combined with the placement of the PIU and permanent institutional
   responsibility for ODS at a relatively low level in the Ministry structure, also contributed to the limited
   communication and co-ordination on ODS issues beyond the Ministry within the Government.

5.4 Costs and financing:
             The capital cost estimate for the originally appraised overall framework project was
             US$32,740,921 made up of US$23,226,990 in GEF grant financing and US$9,513,931 in
             enterprise and government financing. US$29,963,407 was for consumption phase out
             investment sub-projects made up of US$20,999,476 in GEF grant financing and
             US$8,963,931 in enterprise financing. Based on appraised sub-projects including those
             added during implementation, the estimated cost of investment sub-projects was
             US$31,486,733 million inclusive of US$22,375,472 in GEF financing and US$8,994,046 in
             enterprise contribution. The actual overall cost of the project was US$27,704,590. Total
             GEF financing was US$23,181,399 of which US$21,457,256 was devoted to consumption
             phase out investment sub-projects. Enterprise financing for investment sub-projects and
             technical assistance was US$4,524,189. No direct government financing was recorded
             against the project. The following Table 4 provides a summary of appraised investment
             sub-project costs and financing. The approved and actual technical assistance and PIU
             costs are reported previously in the Table 1, Section 3.4, and the overall project costs are
             summarized in Annex 2.

             The variation between appraised and actual costs noted above resulted from a number of
             factors. Significant savings were accumulated through generally positive competitive
             bidding impacts. Early completing sub-projects also generally benefited from favorable
             changes in US$/SDR exchange rates. Later finishing sub-projects were negatively
             impacted by the reversal in US$/SDR exchange rates particularly where procurement
             contracts were denominated in Euros. The overall costs were lower than appraised, largely
             due to lower levels in enterprise financing. US$18,572 in grant funding was left unused.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
   The Project's satisfactory sustainability rating is primarily based on the irreversible nature of the
   successful ODS consumption phase out outcome which was its overall objective. It can be concluded
   with some certainty that Ukraine will not be a consumer of Annex A and B ODS in the future.
   Similarly, the prospects appear good for the long term viability of the majority of investment
   sub-projects undertaken. Therefore, the positive social and economic benefits of the Project
   associated with industrial modernization should be sustained in a market economy. While not altering
   the overall conclusion on sustainability of the Project's ODS phase out outcome, the sustainability of
   the Project's institutional and regulatory outcomes has some uncertainty attached to it. The utilization
   and further development of the institutional mechanisms and regulatory tools stimulated by the
   Project will depend on policy and resourcing commitments of the Governemnt.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
   Within MER, transition arrangements to regular operations related to maintaining the institutional and
   regulatory framework developed under the Project are in place, although to be effectively sustained
   they will have to receive adequate resources. The country continues to maintain its participation in
   international forums on ODS and recent initiatives respecting adoption of an updated country program
   and proceeding with ratification of alter amendments to the Montreal Protocol are encouraging. In
   addition, the general direction of the newly elected government would suggest more proactive policies
   respecting global environmental issues and particularly those prioritized by the European Union.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
   The Bank's performance in undertaking its obligations as a GEF Implementing Agency for the Project
   is considered satisfactory. The Project represented a timely intervention on a major global
   environmental issue in a country important in addressing the ODS phase out issue in the region. It
   integrated its preparation work with bilateral assistance and implementation was coordinated within
   the Bank with similar projects in the region that had significant impact on this Project's outcomes. The
   Project is inherently investment oriented but was designed to provide institutional and regulatory
   support consistent with the needs jointly identified with the Government. The flexible administration of

   the Grant Agreement, while maintaining appropriate due diligence respecting the use of donor funds,
   allowed the Project to overcome various barriers and ultimately facilitated the development of a follow
   up project.

7.2 Supervision:
   The Project's supervision is rated as satisfactory although in the early stages of implementation was a
   factor in the long implementation period. The Project had a number of different task managers during
   this period that along with relatively weak PIU capacity caused initial implementation delays.
   However, the core Project team including the current Task Manager was constant throughout which
   allowed technical continuity and maintenance of critical relationships and networks which ultimately
   led to successful implementation. The Project itself was highly supervision intensive given the large
   number of beneficiaries, the technical complexity of many of the investment component sub-projects,
   the institutional instability encountered, and due diligence requirements associated with a large GEF
   grant. The Grant Agreement was administered rigorously but with enough flexibility to allow the timely
   adjustments which provided counterparts with the opportunity to maximize benefits from it. The
   procurement and disbursement management requirements applicable to the investment and technical
   assistance components of the Project involved a total of 61 separate contracts of which 6 were ICB,
   40 were IS, 11 were NS and 4 were Consultant Firms. Addition contracts for individual consultants
   and consulting firms were covered under the PIU budget. It should also be noted that the Bank was
   required to provide a greater degree of technical support in the procurement process than in other
   similar projects, specifically in development of technical specifications, identification of suppliers and
   generally preparing procurement documentation. Similarly, the Bank team had to undertake a
   significant amount of instruction and assistance in completing sub-project documentation in the form
   of safety audits and sub-project ICRs.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
               On the basis of the above, the overall Bank performance is considered satisfactory.
               Throughout, the Bank as a whole has maintained a strategic perspective of the ODS issue
               as reflected in cross communication with other regions, including the other major ODS
               phase out programs administered by the Bank under the MPMF. Similarly the lesson's
               learned are being applied in the planning of new ODS initiatives in the region as additional
               priorities developed under the MP. At the same time, the Bank responded to the detailed
               supervision needs of this kind of operation. It also reflects the Bank providing the necessary
               patience and timely guidance respecting the needs of the client/beneficiary, particularly
               recognizing the institutional instability that existed through much of the Project
               implementation period.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
               Recipient was not initially well prepared to undertake the Project based on the country
               generally being behind other counties in the region in pursing ODS phase out. However,
               initial capacity, particularly at the enterprise level, was enhanced, during preparation
               through the bilateral assistance provided by the Danish government and subsequently
               through a Bank administered PDF-B grant. By the time, the Project was appraised, a basic
               capacity was developing in the Ministry and ultimately with the creation and staffing of the
               Ozone Office, allowed the grant agreement to be negotiated and become effective, albeit
               after significant delays.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
   The Government's implementation performance is considered moderately satisfactory. While the
   Project met its objectives in terms of ODS Phase out and meeting international obligations, this was
   accomplished without strong government policy commitment as reflected in the delays encountered in
   making the project effective despite the urgent need for action to meet international obligations and
   subsequently the relative passive policy commitment to ODS Phase out during project implementation

   .

7.6 Implementing Agency:
   The overall performance of the local implementing agency parallels that of the Government as a
   whole. Development of institutional capacity for management of ODS phase out and a modest
   project implementation capacity were supported by MENR in terms of policy but this may not be
   resourced sufficiently to ensure sustainability of the project's institutional outcomes. Similarly, the less
   than optimum implementation performance reflects limitations in the capacity of MEPNR to
   administer such projects. This was particularly evident over the final two years and by the incomplete
   tasks and actions remaining at project closing.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
             Overall the Recipient's implementation performance is considered satisfactory largely on
             the strength of having substantively completed the Project and its meeting the principle
             objectives.    This is largely a consequence of the efforts of the majority beneficiary
             enterprises.

8. Lessons Learned


             Placement of PIU Capacity within the Institutional Structure: This Project applied the
             model of having the PIU capacity within the local implementing agency's structure.
             Nominally, it demonstrated the benefit of this arrangement in developing and putting into
             force the necessary legislative and regulatory measures needed to support ODS phase out
             within the organization that must champion and implement them. Theoretically it also
             provides a linkage to their direct application to investment sub-project beneficiaries.
             However, The PIU's placement at a relatively low level within the overall implementing
             agency limited its effectiveness in coordinating actual sub-project implementation and in
             sponsoring the necessary enforcement capacity. This structure also led to delays and
             inefficiencies in actually administering procurement and disbursement arrangements. The
             main lesson learned from this is that while PIU placement within the operational structure of
             a responsible local implementing agency is beneficial, it must be placed high enough to
             have access to decision-making in order to have the authority and influence to effectively
             champion the project's objectives and be able to operate somewhat independently of the
             restrictive administrative structure.

             Prospects of future global environmental initiatives: This Project offers useful direction
             on undertaking future global environmental initiatives of this type in Ukraine. The country
             is proposing to expand its international commitments with respect to ODS phase out and
             may qualify for international assistance in support of their implementation. This will relate
             primarily to methyl bromide where a project has already been prepared by the Bank and
             potentially to transitional ODS. In this regard, the positive experience with refrigeration
             servicing benefits in the current project provide useful experience in minimizing refrigerant
             use generally with the added benefit of reducing potential emission of high GWP
             refrigerants and increasing energy efficiency. It also extends to the broader management of
             chemicals on a global basis such as persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals where
             the country has major legacies and potentially significant global impacts. The results of this
             Project send a positive message to the international community on the country's interest in
             such future initiatives, with its successful completion. As a consequence, the Government
             and the Bank should pursue these opportunities expeditiously in order to capitalize on the
             creditability and experience derived from this Project. However, in doing so, new initiatives
             should be better integrated into the overall strategy jointly adopted with the Government for
             new environmental initiatives and should also link to broader CAS objectives. While this
             Project was undertaken essentially in isolation of other Bank operations, future initiatives
             should be integrated where possible to other sectoral initiatives. The linkage between



                                                    - 15 -

methyl bromide phase out and the grain sector is an example of such an opportunity.

Importance of counterpart commitment and financial contribution: An overall lesson
that should be drawn from this Project and one that is noted in other projects in the region is
the correlation between implementation performance and counterpart financial
commitments. At the local implementing agency level the general support provided by the
Project for developing and sustaining capacity within it through the PIU budget was not
matched by any real financial commitment from the Government, nor is it apparent that
what now exists will be sustained. The lesson learned is that future projects should ensure
that creditable commitments for matching government funding are built into the project
design and as part of Grant conditionality. Otherwise an over dependence on grant funding
develops and timely replacement of this support to sustain the results is less likely to be
provided for.

Importance of enterprise commitment and financial contribution: The most successful
sub-projects in terms of meeting objectives and offering sustaining economic and social
benefits to the country were those where enterprise contributions after implementation were
both significant and timely. Conversely, where enterprise contributions were smaller or
delayed, poorer results were obtained. JSC "Nord" represents a model for this kind of
operation where the enterprise aggressively implemented the project and the rate of
implementation was only limited by processing and procurement timing constraints imposed
under the Project's framework. In particular, it demonstrated the effectiveness and value of
enterprise commitment both in terms of making timely and significant enterprise
contributions and the dedication of its own staff to leaning Bank procedures and effectively
managing it themselves. A similar characteristic was exhibited by DNK Service who
developed a model recovery and reclaim operation for refrigerants as well as a national and
regional training capability, largely on its own initiative. Other examples of strong enterprise
commitment with effective and timely implementation were the sub-projects at
Electronmash and Dnipro-MTO. The majority of the other sub-projects, while successfully
completed, suffered substantial delays in implementation for a variety of reasons. These
mainly relate to a higher dependence on PIU support in areas such as procurement
management and extended periods were involved with preparation of procurement
documents, evaluation of bidders and particularly the negotiation and activation of
contracts. The major impact of these delays was extended periods between the enterprises
having access to ODS and being able to re-start production with non-ODS technology. The
two sub-projects considered the least satisfactory were the two aerosol sub-projects where
extended implementation delays occurred largely as a result of enterprise reluctance to
make timely counterpart investment and continual attempts to renegotiate the amount of
the sub-grant. As a consequence these enterprises face uncertainties respecting economic
viability and sustainability, something for which ongoing monitoring is recommended.

Flexibility and transparency in the use of technical assistance resources: The Project
took a pragmatic approach to the use of resources originally earmarked for institutional
strengthening technical assistance by transferring these to the PIU support component.
The basic rationale for this was to get around significant institutional and legal barriers that
existed in hiring consulting firms, both local and foreign, as well as individual consultants
under Bank procurement rules. While the results were generally satisfactory, this process
was less transparent and actual outputs from GEF funding were not as readily apparent. A
lesson to be gained is that future Projects carefully evaluate the practicality of supporting
TA under Bank procedures, get agreement that this can be done before committing
resources to such activities, and clearly define what will be done within PIU budgets and
within a TA component. In this regard, the recommended requirement of creditable
Government contribution in this area should allow a better distinction to be made between
grant funded TA, administered transparently under the Grant Agreement and the use of
internal resources under contract within the PIU.

              Supervision intensity of large investment portfolios: This Project provides an example
              of the supervision intensive nature of operations involving multiple, technically diverse and
              complex investment sub-projects as well as supporting technical assistance. This is
              particularly true where grant based financing is governed by strict eligibility requirements
              and Bank due diligence obligations related to safety and appropriate use of donor funds.
              While supervision resources were mostly adequate in this case, development of future
              projects of this nature should ensure that this requirement is recognized and matched to
              PIU capacity.



9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
   The main objective of the project - the conversion to ozone-friendly technologies of the leading
   industrial enterprises in Ukraine has been achieved. The positive outcomes of the successful
   implementation of the project at NORD, for example, were the increase in refrigerators production and
   competitiveness of the enterprise as well as substantial saving of the energy resources.

   Project implementation along with addressing mainly environmental issues resulted in substantial
   strengthening of the economic potential of the country  Ukrainian enterprises were supplied with new
   modern equipment, which had not been not produced and used earlier. In addition to the
   above-mentioned enterprise (domestic refrigeration), two chemical enterprises SHCP and DCP were
   fully supplied with new can and valve manufacturing equipment respectively. These enterprises were
   the biggest ODS consumers in Ukraine. Also the conversion of such enterprises as REFMA
   (Melitopol) and Kharkiholodmash (Kharkiv) has been successfully completed.

   At the initial stage of the project implementation for the purpose of its better efficiency the Ministry
   initiated and later the World Bank supported the idea of making revision and introducing some
   changes into the general concept, the procurement plan and the work prjgram. The above mentioned
   activity, low biddings for equipment supply and re-denomination by the Bank made possible to
   relocate resources for initiation of six additional investment sub-projects (five in refrigeration servicing
   and one in halon recovery) - total amount was about $ 1 ml. Taking into consideration the prohibition
   of ODS export to Ukraine - halon recovery sub project (halons are widely used in fire fighting and
   explosion prevention) is very important strategically.

   Costs-savings made it possible to initiate and complete preparation of Methyl Bromide Phase-out
   Project in Ukraine. This issue is considered as one of the paramount importance under the Montreal
   Protocol and is critical for Ukraine.

   During the time of the project implementation the team of professionals was formed. Attending
   seminars and trainings which were organized by the World Bank the members of the team got
   necessary experience in project management, financial monitoring, complicated procurement
   procedures in biddings not in use in Ukraine before. The project supported institutional strengthening
   which helped to substantially expedite the fulfillment of all planned activities at the final stage. This
   factor plays an important role in successful implementation of other projects with participation of the
   World Bank.

   It is hard to overestimate the impact of the project in creating conditions not only for introduction of
   ozone-friendly technologies, but also for improvement of legislation in              Ukraine to fulfill its
   international obligations under the Montreal Protocol.

   In fact, success in the project implementation created necessary conditions for the Copenhagen
   Amendment ratification and Government's decision on ODS export/import prohibition of Annexes A
   and B of the MP according to the terms, stated by Decision 10/27 of the MP regarding Ukraine.
   Currently Ukraine is in a preparatory process of the ratification of the Montreal and Beijing

   Amendments to the MP. The ratification of these Amendments will substantially bring national
   environmental laws on the Ozone Layer protection of Ukraine closer to EU standards.

   Lessons learned.

   Project implementation has resulted in deep understanding of the necessity of early (preparatory
   stage) adjustments of national legislative system in reimbursement, taxation and bidding procedures
   to the World Bank regulations and requirements.

   The second lesson learnt is the necessary to simplify complicated bureaucratic system of approvals
   and adoption of decisions (regarding formal, financial, and other issues). It would help to achieve
   better effectiveness.

   The team for project implementation should be carefully selected based on real conditions of the
   project implementation, its objectives and tasks. The members of the team should posses good
   professional knowledge and permanently improve it.

   It is very important for successful implementation of any long term (more than 1 or 2 years) project to
   be implemented by the same team of professionals and the same supervisors from the World Bank as
   well as from the Ministry.

   To enforce project successful implementation every beneficiary enterprise should create a permanent
   group of professionals to maintain contacts with the main team for project implementation regarding
   biddings, technical specifications, and other issues.

   We find necessary to acknowledge the activity of the World Bank  acting as an implementation
   agency for the Global Environmental Facility. At the initial stage and during its implementation the
   project faced some difficulties, which caused some impediments (long ratification process,
   development and adoption of legislative documents regarding equipment supply taxation, etc). Under
   such conditions the Bank has demonstrated flexibility in it's approach, willingness to understand
   problems and has given support to address them rapidly.

   Cooperation with the experts of the World Bank was an important element of our activity. Their
   professionalism made possibly to reach project objectives at a high scientific and technical level.
