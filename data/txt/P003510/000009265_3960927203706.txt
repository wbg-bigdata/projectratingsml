MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A FIFTH INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
People's Republic of China for the equivalent of $300 million are submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would have a repayment term of 20 years, including 5
years' grace, with interest at the standard variable rate and would help finance
a fifth industrial credit project through the China Investment Bank (CIB).
2.        Background.  Reflecting the past priority given ta the industrial
sector and the high rates of capital accumulation, China's gross industrial
output has grown at an impressive annual average rate of close to 11Z since the
early 1950s. Industry now makes up about half of China's GDP and employs 18S of
the total labor force. Gross industrial output is shared almost equally by light
and heavy industry, although in recent years the former has been growing
substantially faster than the latter. However, China's industry his suffered
from distorted economic policies, outdated equipment and technology, uneconomic
scale of operations, and a lack of autonomy for enterprise management. Its
development has been further hampered by a weak financial sector and lack of
suitable intermediaries for delivering medium- and long-term finance. Indeed,
until 1984 banks in China were little more than fiscal agents for the government.
3.        Since 1979, GOC has systematically attempted to remove fundamental
weaknesses in the economy. The development strategy for the industrial sector
has emphasized modernization of equipment, development of more efficient light
industry, promotion of manufactured exports, and material and energy
conservation. The main thrust of the reforms adopted in 1984, and designed to
add greater impetus to the effort, has been two-fold. First, one series of
measures has been aimed at reducing the role of mandatory planning, correcting
the major price distortions and enhancing the role of markets in setting prices
and determining industrial outputs. Second, another set of measures has been
aimed at changing the incentive structure and enlarging the scope for managerial
autonomy at the enterprise level. The 1980s, particularly the period since 1984,
has also seen major and significant financial reforms. The People's Bank of
China (PBC) has shed its commercial and investment banking role and is evolving
into a genuine central bank. The gradual removal of interest rate subsidies and
the increasing uniformity of the interest rate structure (these instruments were
previously not seen as mechanisms for resource allocation or mobilization),
together with the increased use of monetary instruments, have also served to
enhance PBC's role Several large specialized and universal banks have been
estsblished and as the restrictions on market segmentation have gradually been
removed, competition has begun to emerge. The last few years have also seen the
establishment of several hundred investment companies, particularly at the local
and provincial levels, and the emergence of some 1,500 urban credit cooperatives.
Not surprisingly, this rapid progress has created its own problems. For example,
development of procedures within PBC for financial management and the expansion
of its supervisory and regulatory capability have lagged behind the overall
growth of the financial system; many real interest rates still remain negative;
experiments with the capital markets have only just begun; and the degree of
autonomy of the banks from the central and provincial governmental authorities
remains limited.



- 2 -
4.        One key element of the Bank's own operational strategy for China's
financial sector has been to help GOC focus on the need for institutional
broadening and deepening; prerequisites for the success of the ongoing reform
program. The Bank's Finance and Investment Report (June, 1987) made significant
and specific recommendations on ways to strengthen the supervision and regulation
of the banking system and to develop a competitive framework within which
customer-oriented banking institutions can develop. To support GOC's efforts to
strengthen financial intermediation, the Bank provided advice and assistance for
the establishment of CIB in 1982.  Four IBRD/IDA operations (totalling
$645.6 million) have contributed to CIB's rapid growth as a financial
intermediary specializing in investment loans for small- and medium-sized
restructuring projects sponsored mainly by enterprises in the light industry
sector. The Bank is currently preparing a Financial Institutions Development
Loan (FIDL) to support and strengthen two of the largest banks in China. In
addition, the Bank is helping develop a technical assistance program (which may
be supported under the FIDL) mainly to strengthen the supervision and regulation
of the banking system. Further major financial sector work to assist GOC in the
next stage of its reform program, which would in turn provide the overall
framework for the Bank's continued support to the sector, is planned for FY90.
5.        CIB commenced operations in 1983 as a government-owned development
finance institution. It has paid-in capital of Y 1,159 million ($312 million
equivalent). Its organization consists of: (a) a head office in Beijing, which
performs an administrative and supervisory role for all its operations; and
(b) 31 provincial branch offices, which have direct responsibility for screening,
appraisal and supervision of subprojects. To allow greater autonomy to the
branches and to expedite decision-making, CIB has started delegating loan
approval authority to the branches; however, the head office still makes
decisions on larger loans. At the end of 1988, CIB's total staff was 1,338 and
included 173 engineers and 455 economists/financial analysts. A large number of
staff has received training--both inside and outside China--under the technical
assistance (TA) component of the Bank Group's first and fourth credits to CIB,
through programs of the Economic Development Institute (EDI), and through
assistance provided by other financial institutions. However, middle-level
managers and professional staff still need to enhance further their advanced
financial skills, for which they require continued intensive training and more
experience.
6.        CIB's project appraisal work is being undertaken in accordance with its
Project Appraisal Manual, which was prepared with Bank assistance. In the snort
time since its inception, CIB has made considerable progress in evaluating and
appraising investment projects. However, there is need for further improvement,
particularly in the areas of economic and market analysis. Project superv:sion
by CIB follows its Project Supervision Manual and is quite intensive. CIB plans
to implement an electronic data processing system to improve its accounting and
financial management information system and to coordinate better and monitor
operational and financial data and information between the head office and the
branches.
7.        CIB's loan approvals increased seven-fold between 1983-88, reaching
$430 million in foreign currency and Y 514 million in local currency (total of
$565 million equivalent) in 1988. A slight decline in CIB's term loan approvals
is expected in 1989 because of current restraints on credit expansion in China
designed to combat inflation. However, lending growth is expected to regain its
momentum by 1990-91. CIB is diversifying its sources of both foreign and local
currency funds. In 1986-88, it borrowed $210 million from international



- 3 -
commercial sources, and in 1987, received the first Asian Development Bank loan
of $100 million. The quality of CIB's portfolio and financial position is
satisfactory. During its relatively short existence, CIB has made rapid progress
in developing its staff and operating systems and has adopted a more
commercially-oriented style. However, its institutional deepening has sometimes
lagged behind the expansion in its organizational structure and operations. Thus
there is a need for continued and vigorous efforts to strengthen its staff and
procedures.
8.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Consistent with the reform process in
China, CIB has prepared a new development strategy and operational and financial
plans based thereon for 1989-92. Its main focus is on continued investment
financing of its traditional clientele, i.e., state enterprises in the light
industry sector, where, over the years, CIB has developed a special expertise.
However, a modest diversification toward collective enterprises, justified in
view of their growing importance in China and the relative dynamism of the
nonstate sector, is also planned. In addition, CIB intends to diversify its
financial resources further and to introduce, although on a limited scale in the
beginning, new products (mainly working capital financing and eqvuity investments,
including leasing operations) and services (guarantees, managed loans, letters of
credits, etc.) for its clients.
9.        Bank assistance for the proposed project would help implement CIB's new
development strategy and operational plan. Particular emphasis would be given to
its further institutional strengthening, including development of the new
products, which will in turn strengthen its ability to compete and survive in the
rapidly changing financial environment in China. During the project preparation
stage, the Bank provided CIB management and staff with substantial advice and
guidance in planning new products and services. For example, key CIB staff
visited merchant and commercial banks in other countries, and senior staff of two
such banks participated in the pre-appraisal of the project.
10.       Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project would support:  (a) continued
institutional strengthening of CIB in both its traditional and new areas of
activity; (b) expansion and diversification of CIB's resource base; and
(c) financing of investment in the modernization and restructuring of light
industry and removal of its operational bottlenecks.
11.       Proiect Description.  The project includes the following components to
be financed under the proposed Bank loan: (a) industrial credit of $299.0
million for CIB for (i) term lending ($244 million) to help continue CIB's main
financial intermediation function for the import of modern equipment and
technology by the light industry sector; (ii) workint canital loans ($50 million)
to allow CIB to fund the working capital needs of eligible enterprises (CIB would
also provide local currency funds for working capital through its own resources);
and (iii) equity financing ($5 million) to provide CIB a source of funds for
equity participation in suitable projects and enterprise restructuring programs
and for equipment leasing; and (b) technical assistance of $1 million for (i) an
expanded training program ($300,000) for CIB staff in existing and new financial
products and services to include specific training for the development of sound
credit evaluation and supervision techniques, trade financing arrangements and
international settlements; and (ii) computer hardware and software ($700,000) for
CIB's proposed electronic data processing system and for related training.
12.       The total cost of the CIB V project is tentatively estimated at about
$460 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of $300.0 million



- 4 -
(652). Final cost estimates will depend on the individual subprojects that CIB
finances under the industrial credit component. A breakdown of the tentative
cost estimates and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements ard the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A
map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 1659-CHA, dated
April 28, 1989, is being distributed separately.
13.       Agreed Actions.  GOC has agreed to onlend the loan proceeds to CIB on
the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the proposed Bank loan. CIB
has agreed to she following major actions and conditions. (a) CIB will onlend to
subborrowers at the Bank's standard variable interest rate plus a minimum spread
of 1.5Z p.a. (b) Subborrowers will carry the foreign exchange risk between the
Bank's currency pool and the yuan except that Cc) subborrowere with a loan amount
of less than $1 million will have the option of carrying the foreign exchange
risk between the US dollar and the yuan only, subject to payment of an
appropriate fee to CIB for carrying the risk between the currency pool and the
US dollar. The fee will not be less than 0.5Z p.a., and CIB will have the right
to increase the fee up to 22 p.a. if, during the life of the subloan, CIB
considers an increase necessary to protect itself adequately against the exchange
risk. (d) The maximum subloan size will be $20 million. (e) Eligible
subprojects will be in the light industry sector and will be sponso-ed by
enterprises with a satisfactory projected financial position; in additIon, the
subprojects will have minimum economic rates of return (ERRs) and financial rates
of return (FRRs) of 122. (f) Subprojects will comply with Bank guidelines on
pollution control. (g) CIB's debt/equity ratio will not exceed 5:1. (h) CIB
will implement a resource mobilization plan agreed to by GOC and the Bink.
Ci) CIB will increase its accumulated provision for bad debts to a min=mum of 22
of its portfolio by 1992.   (j) CIB will exchange views with the Bank on its
interest rates and the fee for foreign exchange risk.
14.       Benefits.  The project will further the institutional development of
CIB, including the introduction of new products and services. Thit strengthening
will help prepare CIB to face the newly emerging competition effectiveiy and
will support the institutional deepening that is critical to the success of the
reforms. The project will also help upgrade the productivity and efficiency of
about 200 small- and medium-sized projects in the light industry sector by
supporting imports of modern technology and other inputs.
15.       Risks.  The project risks relate mainly to CIB's sustaitned and
successful institution-building and its future role in development financing.
The assurances obtained from CIB management and GOC's commitment to financial
sector reform should ensure successful implementation of the project and
realization of its objectives.
16.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan woUld comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
