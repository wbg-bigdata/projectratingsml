Ozone Depleting Substances Phase Out
A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The project development objective of this Montreal Protocol Project (MP) is to protect the
stratospheric ozone layer by providing financial incentives for industrial conversion from ODS to non-ODS
technologies and promote measures which reduce/eliminate emissions of Ozone Depleting Substances
(ODS).
Performance indicators measuring progress towards achieving the development objective would
include: (a) number of subprojects adopting alternative technologies; (b) metric Tons of ODSs phased out
during project implementation; (c) enterprise compliance with equipment disposal agreements; and (d)
(UTO) in identifying, facilitating the preparation of, and monitoring implementation of MP ExCom approved
projects.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
Reduced levels of air and water pollution, specifically reduction or elimination of consumption of ODS.
CAS document number: 17107 CO
Date of latest CAS discussion: October 15,1997
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The principal strategic issue to be addressed in the project is the requirement that nations phase out
the use of CFC's and other ODS, as mandated by the Montreal Protocol, to which Colombia is a party since
1992. The Country Program was presented and approved during the 12th meeting of the Executive
Committee (ExCom) of the MF in March 1994. Although the strategy presented at that time was oriented to
accelerate the ODS phaseout starting in 1996, the GOC has since revised its position to follow the MP
phaseout chronogram (see Table I). Seventeen projects with a cumulative grant value of US$ 9.5 million and
a projected phase out potential of 980 MT ODP have been approved by the MP Ex Comm since then. All of
them have been implemented. The UNDP has been the implementing agency for 16 of the projects, and the
USEPA for the other one. The implementation strategy of the GOC is to assist Colombian enterprises in
converting manufacturing processes to non-ODS technology by facilitating access to MP Grant Funds, and
through dissemination of conversion technology information and techniques.

3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The sectoral breakdown for the approved projects includes six domestic refrigerator factory
conversions completed (243 MT ODP), which have eliminated ODS in new refrigerators. The remainder of
the approved implemented projects include two polystyrene foam producers (320 MT ODP); eight projects
in the commercial refrigeration fabrication and service sectors, and a mobile air conditioning (MAC) service
project. A Bank implemented MP operation will present potential beneficiaries with a fundamental choice of
implementation strategies. In Bank supported MP operations enterprise beneficiaries develop their own
engineering solutions, which are then presented to counterpart executing agencies and the Bank's technical
quality control monitor, the Ozone Operations Resource Group (OORG) for endorsement before transmittal
to the MFEC for funding approval. Enterprises are then responsible for procurement and installation of the
conversion technology. Technical assistance is available upon request during preparation and
implementation. The UNDP uses a more centralized approach, with much of the engineering and equipment
specification being carried out directly by UNDP technical consultants, with equipment being procured
centrally through UNDP Operations. Availability of the Bank operation will now provide beneficiary
enterprises with a choice of implementation strategy which has not been previously available. UNIDO is not
active in Colombia.

Project Component 1 .-Investment in Subprojects: The objective of this subcomponent is to finance
about 25 subprojects with Colombian enterprises which are currently using ODS in their production
processes. It is expected that in the short run priority sectors will be rigid polyurethane, foam thermal panel
producers, mobile air conditioner and commercial refrigeration (see Annex 6).
Project Component 2.- Technical Assistance: The objective of this subcomponent is to provide
financing for technical support in the areas of subproject preparation and evaluation
Project Component 3. - Administration and Supervision : The objective of this subcomponent is to
provide financing for the administration and supervision of Investment Subprojects, and for the financial
management of the Project (including audits thereof)

2 Key policy and institutional reforms to be sought:
The operation's purpose is to use the Bank as an impleMenting agency for channeling MPOTF funds
to eligible beneficiaries in Colombia. As negotiated in the London Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.
which established the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund, implementing agencies are specifically precluded
from establishing policy conditionalities or institutional reforms as conditions of disbursement.
3. Benefits and target population:
The target population of beneficiaries for this project are the industries which use ODS in their
production operations, especially rigid polyurethane foam producers who use R-1 1 as a foaming agent, and
commercial refrigeration equipment producers and service organizations. The operation will seek to identify
and implement technology conversions in as many ODS consuming operations as possible where phase out
can be implemented within the cost effectiveness thresholds established by tht MP Ex Comm (see Annex 9).
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The MinAmbiente, acting through the Unit mentioned below, will be the designated GOC executing
agency for the operation. The Colombian Agency for International Cooperation (ACCI) will act as the
financial agent. The ACCI was created by Law 318, of 1996. It is a public agency ascribed to the National
Planning Department with its own juridical personae, patrimony and administrative autonomy.
Within MinAmbiente, the Ozone Technical Unit (UTO), established in 1995, will be directly
responsible for project execution. The UTO will: (i) assist with the promotion of subproject identification
and coordinate subproject preparation; and (ii) in conjunction with ACCI, supervise subproject
implementation, including monitoring of equipment disposal agreements. UTO operation is supported by MP
institutional strengthening funding for which the UNDP is the implementing agency.
ACCI started its activities in December 1997 as the Colombian institution responsible of channeling
all projects and programs that the country presents to the cooperating sources. The Agency's main
objectives are the coordination, management and promotion of non-reimbursable technical and financial
cooperation that the country receives. ACCI under the proposed MP operation will: i) administer OTF funds
for subprojects endorsed by the UTO, and approved by the Bank's OORG and the MP Exec Comm; ii)
disburse grants to subproject beneficiaries; iii) maintain project and subproject accounts, and arrange audits;
iv) supervise subproject implementation in conjunction with UTO; and v) ensure that procurement and
disbursement will be in accordance with Bank guidelines and project procedures; and vi) evaluate the
financial viability of enterprises based on eligibility criteria agreed with the Bank. ACCI will support travel
and other expenses for subproject preparation and supervision, by UTO, outside of Bogota.
The grant proceeds will be disbursed through an OTF Umbrella Grant Agreement between the Bank,
ACCI (the Recipient) and the Republic of Colombia, acting through MinAmbiente. That agreement will
designate UTO as the project executing agency. MinAmbiente and ACCI will agree, from time to time,
which portion of the technical assistance component shall be made available to UTO to defray its
expenditures connected with the Project such as expenditures for travel, per diem, and monitoring and
evaluation. As such, ACCI's responsibilities shall be that of a general administrator of grant disbursements.
A Project Operations Manual, to be approved by the Bank as a condition of effectiveness, will detail the
respective responsibilities of each of the parties with regard to project operations. Subgrant agreements,
based upon a model to be approved by the Bank, will be entered into between ACCI and subproject
beneficiaries, following approval of grant proceed to defray subproject incremental costs by the MFEC and
subproject appraisal reports by the Bank. Retroactive reimbursement of eligible expenditures incurred after



Page 5
1995 up to a cumulative value of US$lmillion of the OTF Grant will be permitted, in accordance with
MFEC's applicable policies.
Subproject Identification, Preparation and Implementation Procedures. For subproject
identification, preparation and implementation, MinAmbiente (through the UTO) and the beneficiary
enterprises will be guided by the Subproject Preparation and Implementation Guidelines (Annex 7). These
guidelines along with guidelines for document preparation, eligibility criteria, incremental cost and cost
effectiveness thresholds will be fully detailed in the Project Operational Manual which will be prepared by
UTO/ACCI and is a condition of OTF Grant Agreement Effectiveness.
Subproject identification will be a cooperative effort among enterprises, UTO, industry
associations and technical consultants. When a potential eligible subproject has been identified,
MinAmbiente will transmit a concise project summary to the Bank. Through mutual consultation, the Bank
and UTO will decide if the proposed subproject meets MP eligibility standards (Annex 9. B). MinAmbiente
will also assess any potential environmental impact. If the review is positive, a staff member from UTO and
a technical consultant will meet with the beneficiary enterprise and decide on a preparation schedule and the
level of external assistance. The beneficiary enterprise will also be instructed on the measures to take to
prepare the project for approval by MinAmbiente and transmittal to the Bank for OORG review.
The Montreal Protocol list of eligible activities, indicative list of categories of incremental costs, and
MFEC decisions, all of which are consolidated in the MF "Policies, Procedures, Guidelines and Criteria" of
February 1997, will guide the eligibility selection process. The principal criteria for subproject approval will
be: i) suitability of the replacement technology proposed; ii) cost effectiveness and compliance with sectoral
cost effectiveness thresholds (Annex 4); iii) enterprise financial health; iv) implementability; and v) consistency
with national ODP phase out strategy.
Once identified, a three step process (Annex 7) will be employed to prepare subprojects for submission
to the Bank and the MFEC, and eventual disbursement: i) screening for OTF eligibility; ii) GOC endorsement,
OORG review, and MFEC approval, based upon a Project Document (Annex 7) prepared by UTO in
conjunction with the enterprise: and iii) execution of a subgrant agreement between ACCI and the enterprise,
based upon Project Document (Annex 8). MinAmbiente will provide the official endorsement of the GOC on a
no objection basis for subprojects that are to be presented to the Bank for OORG review and subsequently to
the MFEC for funding consideration. Investment proposals and subgrant agreements may be submitted to the
Bank up to October 31, 2003.
Beneficiary enterprises will be responsible for preparation and implementation of their subprojects, including
engineering and procurement, for compliance with all relevant environmental regulations, and for acquisition of
necessary permits.
Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement of goods, works, and services will be in accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines
(January 1995, as revised in January, August 1996 and September 1997 and January 1999), as further specified
in Annex 4. Consultants will be selected in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants,
as further specified in Annex 4.
Disbursement Procedures will be as specified in Annex 4. A Special Account (SA) of US$550,000
(equivalent to about four months of estimated expenditures) will be established in Acacia's name at an
institution acceptable to the Bank.



Page 6
Supervision and Reporting
The UTO will be responsible for overall project and individual subprojects' supervision. ACCI, with
the assistance of UTO, will: (I) prepare semi-annual progress reports for the Bank (ii) submit an annual project
audit report prepared by an independent auditor acceptable the Bank; (iii) monitor enterprise compliance with
environmental and safety standards and equipment disposal agreements; (iv) prepare subproject completion
reports in collaboration with the enterprises upon final implementation of each subproject; (v) notify the Bank
of any significant delays and problems with subproject implementation. Enterprises will agree not to transfer
old ODS-using equipment to another location nor to another enterprise, nor to revert to ODS consuming
technologies.
The Bank's supervision will include field visits to current and prospective beneficiaries, discussion with
the UTO and ACCI on project implementation; review of progress/audit, and subproject appraisal reports. The
Bank will also review with the UTO Colombia's overall progress in implementing national ODS phase out, and
the activities of other MF implementing agencies (UNDP, UNIDO, UNEP) in order to avoid duplication of
effort in relation to the Bank MP project in Colombia. Supervision mission factory visits will monitor
subproject implementation, compliance with environmental and safety standards and training, and evaluation of
project performance according to ENVGC project monitoring criteria. Bank supervision mission teams will
consist of the Project Task Manager, and technical consultants as required.
Project Benefits and Risks
Benefits: The project will assist Colombian ODS users to implement an accelerated ODS phaseout
program by providing grant financing for cost effective subprojects. The target objective, assuming an overall
cost effectiveness ratio of US$ 14.7/kg/yr, will be to phase out 596 MT of ODS or approximately 30% of
Colombia's ODP consumption (2,000 tons per imports of 1997).
Risk Mitigation: The possibility of not being able to develop a sufficient pipeline will be mitigated
through an aggressive campaign of project promotion and subproject identification by the UTO. Such a
possibility will be completely eliminated if the MFEC will approve policy guidelines for financing of
commercial refrigeration user conversion subprojects (at least 500 MT of ODS in Colombia) which are now
being developed by the Bank for the consideration of the MFEC. The already identified pipeline of 18
subprojects with a grant potential of US$ 4.97 million is given in Annex 6. Table 2 below presents the sectoral
breakdown of these subprojects.

Progress has been made on the preparation of the Project Operations Manual, including the model
subgrant agreement, which should be finalized before Grant effectiveness. Also, a time-bound action plan to
strengthen ACCI's accounting and financial management system will be agreed upon, prior to negotiation.
D: Project Rationale
Rationale for Funding from the MF. Colombia is a nation with a large number of ODS consuming domestic
industries; and with many commercial/industrial refrigeration, and central air conditioning installations. Its
phase out schedule is being driven to a certain extent by the phase out schedule in non-Article 5 (developed)
countries, and by impending CFC scarcities and price increases in Colombia's traditional ODS supplier
countries. The rationale for funding will continue to be that which it has been -a means of providing a financial
incentive to those users who will phase out sooner than mandated by the 10 year grace period granted to Article
5 nations, or sooner than warranted by current domestic market conditions, or financial compensation to those
who face threat of loss of competitiveness in the absence of conversion to zero or low ODP technology.
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The Bank has already implemented MP operations in more than 20 nations in which most project
beneficiaries have been private sector industrial and commercial enterprises. The basic model for project
implementation of using a government technical implementing agency and a financial intermediary capable
of disbursing directly to the private sector, coupled with access to international technical consultants through
Bank project preparation funds to assist enterprises with project preparation, has proven to be the most
successful project implementation structure, once adapted for local conditions. Given this background, it
was unnecessary to consider other project implementation alternatives.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The most applicable lessons which are being incorporated in this proposed operation are those which
were learned during implementation of MP operations in other Latin American nations. These are: i) devising a
flexible mechanism for contracting appropriate extemal and domestic consultants - ACCI and UTO will agree
what portion of the 3% FA fee, as needed, will be earmarked specifically for local technical consultants tor



Page 8
subproject supervision; international consultants for project preparation and supervision will be contracted by
the Bank outside the scope of the Grant Agreement, and financed through the Bank's project preparation
budget; ii) designing project implementation arrangements to minimize duplication of review and approval of
subprojects by delegating subproject processing responsibility to a financial agent for international grants,
ACCI, leaving the UTO free to focus on interagency coordination; iii) subgrant agreements will be entered into
by ACCI and the subproject beneficiary; iv) securing support at the appropriate level of government to ensure
that executing agencies, through a combination of MPMF and counterpart support, will have the human and
financial means to implement the operation successfully; v) ensuring that beneficiary tax obligations related to
receipt of OTF Grants are equivalent regardless of choice of international executing agency.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The GoC is a signatory to the Montreal Protocol and has previously submitted 18 subprojects to thze
MPEC for approval, which when fully implemented, will phase out over 900 MT ODP. While the UNDP
has been the most active implementing agency in Colombia to date, the GOC specifically requested the Bank
to establish an operation to provide the enterprise strategic alternatives. Indicative of the GOC's
commitment is the approval by Congress of the Grant tax relief legislation.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project.
The Bank, as one of the implementing agencies of the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund (MPMF),
has designed and financed phase out projects in over twenty countries throughout the world including, in
Latin America, countries such as: Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador, Chile and Venezuela.
E: Summary Project Analysis
1. Economic: MP operations are narrowly defined, single purpose projects to facilitate elimination of a
potentially adverse environmental hazard rather than to achieve a conventionally defined economic
development objective. The economic efficiency indicator used to judge resource allocation, the ODP Phase
Out Cost Effectiveness ratio, can only be applied to specific subproject funding proposals.
2. Financial. The financial analysis of MP investment subprojects is limited to that which is necessary to
assess whether the enterprise can utilize the OTF Grant productively. This latter is commonly defined as
whether or not the enterprise will continue in operation at its existing level of operations for five years or
more.
Fiscal impact: None
3. Technical: In all MP projects, the project beneficiaries develop their own engineering solutions which are
then presented to counterpart executing agencies for endorsement and then on to MFEC for funding
approval. MinAmbiente's Ozone Unit (UTO) will review subprojects for funding eligibility, technical
soundness, and compliance with the objectives of MPMF. The Bank will assist the companies in defining
their technical options and project design.
Since 1993, UTO has played a key role in the implementation of MP activities supported by UNDP. By the
end of 1998, this program had eliminated approximately 980 tons of ODS consumption at a cost of US$10
million. During project preparation UTO will collect data detailing consumption of ODS by sector. During
project preparation UTO consultants carried out a survey and interview program detailing consumption of
ODS by sector. This information will serve as input into subproject identification. The results indicate that
1997 annual import totals for controlled ODS's as recorded by the National Directorate for importers and
distributors only were CFC-11, 725MT; CFC-12, 1077 MT; CFC-113, 105 MT; TCA, 57 MT; and carbon



Page 9
tetrachloride, 20 MT. The recorded combined total (disaggregated figures not available) of uncontrolled R-
22, and ODS substitutes HCFC-141b and HCFC-134a was 560 MT. Additional information supplied by
major direct users showed that in addition to the total recorded R- 12 consumption of 1077 MT,
approximately 500 MT was imported directly by foam producers for use as a foaming agent for expanded
polystyrene production in plants where financing of conversion under UNDP executed projects has already
been approved by the MPEC. The figures thus indicate that most of the 1077 MT imported by distributors is
used primarily for commercial and domestic refrigeration and MAC servicing. Of the 725 MT recorded R-
11 imports, approximately 500 MT was used in polyurethane production in plants whose reconversion
financing for projects executed by the UNDP has already been approved. Much of the remainder is thought
to be used in smaller polyurethane foam operations, and in servicing of R-1 1 using central air conditioning
units. More precise data on the structure of consumption will be available upon completion of the still
ongoing work.
4. Institutional:
a. Executing agencies: The executing agency for this project would be MinAmbiente, through its Ozone
Unit, UTO, that has the responsibility to coordinate activities to promote the MP mandated ODS phase out.
In addition, UTO, has broad policy, regulatory and monitoring mandates along with subproject identification,
preparation, implementation and supervision. UTO will work closely with A(CCI who will act as the
project's financial agent. The responsibilities of ACCI are detailed below.
b. Project management: Day to day project management will be in the hands of UTO. UTO will: i) assist
with the identification of subprojects; ii) supervise subproject implementation; and iii) prepare a completion
report. ACCI will: a) administer funds allocated by the Bank through the OTF to subproject endorsed by
UTO and approved by the MFEC; b) evaluate (due diligence) the financial viability of enterprises; c)
disburse grants on behalf of subproject beneficiaries; d) maintain project accounts and arrange project
account audits.
a. Social: N/A
6. Environmental assessment:  Environmental Category  []A   [X] B   []C
The overall project objective is protection of the stratospheric ozone layer through financing of
measures which will eliminate or reduce emissions of ODS. The transition to non-ODS technologies or
substitution of ODS with other chemicals may involve other environmental risks and safety risks such as use of
flammable substitutes or, in the case of solvent subprojects, increased waste water discharges. Sponsoring
enterprises will be responsible for meeting emissions standards, preparing impact statements, and obtaining
environmental clearances as required by Colombian law, and consistent with World Bank environmental
guidelines. The MinAmbiente will ensure that subprojects have complied with the above environmental
requirements before officially submitting subprojects to the Bank for OORG review. The overall ODS Phase
Out Project is classified as a Category B (OD 4.01). The environmental data sheet is shown in Annex 11.

approach not used, describe why not applicable]: N/A
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
A subproject will be considered sustainable if it has resulted in a substitution of a zero or low ODP
for an ODS. Given the technical changes which are taking place and the lack of future CFC availability it is
unlikely that a reconversion back to use of ODS would take place. Institutional sustainability for the
ACCIJUTO project management team will be assured by the sharing of the technical assistance component
and earmarked budget for expenses. The technical assistance assures sustainability for project supervision
and evaluation. Assurances will have to be obtained from MinAmbiente that resources to support sustained
operation of the UTO during the life of the project will be forthcoming.
2. Critical Risks (reflecting assumptions in the fourth column ofAnnex 1):
The greatest risk follows from the substantial phase out activity which has already taken place in
Colombia, i.e. difficulty in developing a sufficient pipeline of cost effective eligible projects to fully commit the
proposed US$8.7 million grant line. All large domestic and some commercial refrigerator manufacturing
factory conversions have already been financed, as have the main polystyrene producers. Yet, annual
consumption ODS consumption is still close to 2,000 MT. Remaining ODS consumers are small and medium
size entrepreneurs somewhat dispersed in the main cities of the countries. As noted in Annex 6, however, a
potential pipeline of US$ 4.97 (57% of total grant amount) has already been identified.

Ozone Depleting Substances Phase Out
Project Description
Project Component 1 - Investment in Subprojects US$9.7 million
The objective of this component is to support about 25 subprojects which will assist Colombian
enterprises in their efforts to phase out the use of ODS and convert existing production processes to non-
ODS technologies.
Active subproject pipeline development for the proposed operation began during May 1998 project
preparation mission, and has continued hereafter. Eighteen enterprises have been identified as having
potential eligibilily for conversion subprojects. These companies along with others participated in surveys of
ODS consumption which were designed and executed under the guidance of UITO. The eighteen enterprises
already identified have a potential eligible grant amount of US$ 4.97 million. included are four subprojects
which have already been approved by the MPEC for US$ 387,570.
Subprojects will be identified, prepared and implemented in accordance with subproject guidelines
detailed in the MPMF's Report of February 1997 which consolidates all policies, procedures guidelines and
criteria for financing of ODS phase out activities.
Subproject identification will be a cooperative effort among enterprises, UTO, industry association3,
and technical consultants. When a potentially eligible subproject has been identified, the enterprise and UTO
will prepare a brief project summary for transmittal to the Bank. UTO will review the subproject summary to
determine its eligibility and cost-effectiveness. Through mutual consultation, the Bank and UTO will decide
if the proposed project meets MP eligibility standards.
Project Component 2 - Technical Assistance - US$212,000
A technical assistance component has been included to support ACCI/UTO in carrying out
preparation, and supervision of subprojects.
Project Component 3.- Administration and Supervision - US$40,000
An operational costs category has been included to support ACCI/UTO in carrying out
administrative tasks

July. The closing date would be July 31, 2004. Disbursement will follow the procedures detailed in the
disbursement handbook published by the Bank in 1992 and revised in July 1998 and in the Disbursement
Letter, which will be issued after the Grant Agreement is signed.
For eligible expenditures above the prior review threshold, fully documented disbursement requests
will be sent by the beneficiary to ACCI who, approving the contract or after receiving the Bank's no
objection (when required), will issue payment directly to the supplier on behalf of the beneficiary. For
eligible expenditure below the prior review Sows, will be used.
For projects with grant funding of incremental operating costs as well as investment costs, ACCI
will indicate in the subproject appraisal report, the disbursement plan for operating cost grants. After one
year of operation following disbursement of investment costs, an enterprise with funding of incremental
operating costs will provide ACCI with documentation verifying the realized level of annual incremental
operating cost, which will then be compared with the estimate upon which the subgrant approval was based.
If deemed satisfactory, ACCI will approve disbursement of the lesser of the realized level, or the subgrant
amount originally allocated for incremental operating costs.
The allocation of grant proceeds is detailed below in Table C of this annex.
Special Account:
A Special Account in US dollars will be established at ACCI. The Bank will make an initial deposit
of up to US$550,000 into the Special Account opened by ACCI at an institution acceptable to the Bank.
This amount is equivalent to the average expected expenditures during the first 4 months of project
execution. This "Authorized Allocation" shall be limited to an amount equivalent to US$200,000 until the
aggregate amount of withdrawals from the OTF Grant amount plus the total amount of all outstanding
special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be
equal to or exceed the equivalent of US$1,500,000. The account will be replenished in receipt of full
documentation except for expenditures under contracts valued below US$2,000,000 equivalent for goods
and works or for consulting contracts valued below US$100,000 for a consulting firm, or below US$50,000
for individuals for which the Bank will accept Statements of Expenditure (Sows). Supporting documentation
for Sows including contracts, procurement documentation, and evidence of payment should be kept in a
central location for examination by independent auditors and bank staff during supervision missions.
Financial Management
Within MinAmbiente, the Ozone Technical Unit (UTO) in conjunction with the Colombian Agency
for International Cooperation (ACCI) will supervise subproject implementation, including monitoring of
equipment disposal agreements. ACCI will act as the financial agent. Acacia's activities are administered by



Page 19
a group of experienced professionals, including a qualified accountant. Prior to effectiveness, ACCI will
have completed, in terms acceptable to the Bank, the Project Operational Manual. A LAC FMS performed
the required financial management assessment in accordance with OP/BP 10.02. The FMS concluded that
ACCI has appropriate project financial management capabilities and will prepare Project Management
Reports (PMR) from the start of operations. Nevertheless, it was agreed with project management that initial
disbursements would be processed under the Bank's standard disbursement procedure until sufficient
experience is acquired in the preparation and use of Parse. An action plan has been agreed with project
management to reach full command in the use of Parse in project management. ACCI has agreed to engage
a private auditing firm shortly after effectiveness, to perform the required yearly audit of the project,
following terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.

Ozone Depleting Substances Phase Out
Subproject Pipeline
1.     Active pipeline development for the proposed operation commenced during the May, 1998 preparation
mission and will be ongoing during implementation of the umbrella grant. In the short term, the priority sectors
selected for subproject identification are rigid polyurethane foam thermal panel producers, mobile air conditioner
component fabricators and unit assemblers, and commercial refrigeration equipment fabricators. Other projects in the
foam sector will be considered in the next two years of implementation. Also, projects in the medical industry and
solvents will be considered. Table 3 shows a summary of projects already identified by the Bank. The potentially
eligible OTF Grant Amounts for these subprojects, based upon estimated ODP impacts and cost estimates supplied by
the firms is US$ 4.97 million. The UTO is continuing an ongoing process of subproject identification.

2.     The following projects have already been approved by the Executive Committee and are ready for
initiating implementation:
a) FRIOTERMICA. This enterprise located in Bogota consumes 13 MT CFC-1 1 per year, to
manufacture sandwich rigid foam panels for construction and cold storage modular rooms. The



Page 23
company also manufactures commercial refrigeration equipment but its use of CFC-12 has been
already eliminated, charging HCFC-22, R-404a and R-407. It has a low pressure foaming
machine (60 kg/min.). FRIOTERMICA will convert to HCFC- 141b as this seems to be the most
simple and less expensive alternative to CFC-I l. To undertake its conversion, a high pressure
machine would be required by the project.
b) DANIEL J FERNANDEZ. This enterprise located in Barranquilla consumes approximately 25
MT CFC- 11 per year, to produce sandwich rigid foam panels for construction, cold storage
modular rooms, roofs, and piping insulation. It has a low pressure foaming machine (60
kg/min.). DANIEL J. FERNANDEZ has opted for HCFC-141b as this seems to be the most
simple and less expensive alternative to CFC-1 1. To carry out its conversion, the company will
require a high pressure machine.
c) AIASTER COOLER. This enterprise located in Bogota consumes -).3 MT CFC- 11 per year, to
manufacture sandwich rigid foam panels for building insulation and cold storage modular rooms.
It has a high pressure foaming machine (100 kg/min.) and 4 electi-cally heated molds. MASTER
COOLER has made some research on its own about its technical options, and has opted for
HCFC-22 that will later be replaced by HFC- 134a (definitive option). With an adequate in-
house technical capacity this enterprise is developing a pre-mixer equipment for feeding the gab
into the blowing machine.
d) INDUFRIO. This enterprise located in Medellin, consumes 11 MT CFC- 1 1 per year, to
manufacture sandwich rigid foam panels for building insulation and cold storage modular roon s.
To carry out its conversion, the company will require a high pressure machine.
3.    Other projects that have been already pre-appraised are:
a) POLARES. The company produces small ice cream freezers and other glass display units for
convenience stores and supermarkets. POLARES also produces sandwich panels. It has two low
pressure injection machines. They consume approximately 11 tons of CFC- 11 and 3 MT CFC- 12 per
year. A project is expected to be ready for submission to the ExCom in 1999.
b) INDUSTRIAS SUPER NORDICO. The company manufactures commercial refrigeration cases for use
in display and conservation of food products. The range of products includes vertical coolers with
multiple doors, reach-in cabinets, and freezers. In addition the company manufactures panels for its own
products. The company's consumption data for CFC-I I and CFC-12 is 5 MT and 3 MT, respectively. A
project is expected to be ready for submission to the ExCom in 1999.
c) COLSER. A 30 year old company, it manufactures cold storage facilities for the Flower Industry in
particular but also for refrigerated transport. It also manufactures commercial display cases in small
quantities. The company consumes approximately 4 tons of CFC-1 1. The company has a low pressure
machine and has identified a Brazilian manufactured injection machine that may be adequate for its
requirements. A project is expected to be ready for submission to the ExCom in 1999.
d) ROJASHERMANOSLTDA. This enterprise located in Bogota consumes about 20 MT CFC-1 1 per year,
to manufacture sandwich rigid foam panels for building insulation and cold storage modular rooms. It
has a high pressure foaming machine, that will be funded retroactively. A project is expected to be ready
for submission to the ExCom in 1999.



Page 24
e) CALAIRES. This MAC company provided very interesting information about how the MAC Industry is
organized in COLOMBIA. Heat exchangers are manufactured for the sector by a network of Colombian
companies which ultimately feed heat exchanger to CALAIRES. CALAIRES in turn accounts for about
75 % of the MAC systems installed in Colombia through its network which covers the major cities,
where it has a strong position in the market owing to its installation and maintenance network. The
company provides complete kits for about 25-30 different models in the market. Most of the
installations (80%) are done at CALAIRES' network of installation and maintenance shops or at the car
dealerships where CALAIRE is contracted. CALAIRE has purchased equipment to enable the company
to produce fittings and hoses compatible with HFC-134a system installs. The company works in a
tightly integrated market and the complete system is packaged and installed at CALAIRES for the largk
majority of the MAC installs in the Colombia. A comprehensive project for the MAC sector is planned
for submission in 1999 or early 2000.
2 AUTOAIRES and AUTOFRIO assemble complete MAC units with components supplied by others.
When aluminum parallel flow condensers are specified (as is increasingly the case), they are imported.
Both companies have already made minor investments in tooling required to assemble MACs for R-
134a. Any eligible amounts would be small and retroactive. A comprehensive project for the MAC
sector is planned for submission in 1999 or early 2000.
g) MITCHEL fabricates small quantities (3.500/yr) of fin and tube condensers and evaporators and
assembles complete MAC units for both R-12 and R-134a systems. When larger size fin and tube
condensers are not suitable for R-134a applications, Mitchel imports aluminum parallel flow condensers.
The company is undecided as to future strategy vis a vis investing in a fabrication line for aluminum
parallel flow heat exchangers or phasing out fabrication of fin and tube equipment and becoming,
exclusively an importer of components. A comprehensive project for the MAC sector is planned for
submission in 1999 or early 2000.
h) PARAMO fabricates heat exchangers for MAC, commercial refrigeration, and 3 HP and 5 HP package
air conditioner applications. The firm is aware that it will have to install fabrication capacity for R- 1 34a
heat exchangers at some point, or cease fabrication and become exclusively a components importer.
PARAMO has begun to investigate alternatives but has still not decided what to do, influenced also by
the currently unstable market. It is possible that the firm might be eligible for partial financing of
converted production facilities as a fabricator of both MAC and commercial refrigeration equipment
components. A comprehensive project for the MAC sector is planned for submission in 1999 or early
2000.
i) THERMOCOIL is the new company name for the former THERMOTAL. The firm's MAC condenser
production (25,000) would appear to be sufficient to justify OTF financing of an aluminum parallel flow
condenser fabrication line. A comprehensive project for the MAC sector is planned for submission in
1999 or early 2000.
j) RYMCO: This company uses about 12 MT CFC-1 13 per year as silicon diluent in the production of
syringes. The firm still must engineer a project to permit closed circuit condensation, recovery and reuse
of CFC-1 13, or a process to substitute for it. Either solution will be eligible for OTF financing up to the
threshold limit (US$ 235,000). A project is expected to be submitted to the ExCom in 1999.

ANNEX 7
Ozone Depleting Substances Phase Out
Subproject Preparation And Implementation Guidelines
Subprojects will be identified, prepared and implemented in accordance with the following subproject
guidelines, and consistent with the MPMF's Report of February 1997, which consolidates all policies,
procedures, guidelines and criteria for financing of ODS phase out activities. These indicative guidelines,
which will be the basis for UTO's Project Operational Manual, may be modified by mutual agreement between
the Bank and UTO.
Subproject Identification
Subproject identification will be a cooperative effort among enterprises, UTO, industry associations,
and technical consultants. When a potentially eligible subproject has been identified, the enterprise and UTO
will prepare a brief project summary for transmittal to the Bank. UTO will revikw the subproject summary to
evaluate the proposed subproject's conformity with eligibility and cost-effective threshold guidelines (Annex 9).
Through mutual consultation, the Bank and UTO will decide if the proposed project meets MP
eligibility standards. If positive, UTO and a technical consultant will meet with the enterprise to establish a
project preparation schedule, identify external preparation assistance requirements, if any, and to inform the
enterprise concerning project preparation requirements. UTO/ACCI will oversee ability of the enterprise to use
an OTF Grant productively
Subproject Preparation
Project Document (PD). UTO will help subproject beneficiaries (enterprises) in preparing the pre-
investment studies, a draft Project Document per Annex 8 of the guidelines, and an executive project summary
(EPS). Technical consultants will assist by informing enterprises about: (i) alternative technologies; (ii)
Montreal Protocol (MP) Fund eligibility and financing criteria; and (iii) the MP Fund application process.
Technical consultants, also, will assist enterprises to prepare subproject proposals, if required.
OORG Technical Review. Subprojects under preparation should be reviewed on an informal basis by
the appropriate technical expert in the World Bank's Ozone Operations Resource Group (OORG). OORG
comments will be provided to UTO and to the concerned enterprises, and project design and/or cost estimates
revised accordingly. A formal OORG approval will be required for all subprojects before being submitted by
the Bank to the MFEC.
GOC and World Bank Endorsement. After final OORG technical review, and official GoC
endorsement, eligible incremental costs will be verified. Following an agreement by the Bank and UTO as to
the requested OTF Grant amount, subprojects will be submitted to MFEC funding approval.
MFEC Approval
Review and approval of funding for subprojects will be based upon the Project Document, to which
will be appended the final OORG Review and any other relevant technical reports.



Page 26
Subgrant Agreement/Approval for Disbursement
Funding approval by the MFEC signifies only that a Grant under the OTF Grant Agreement in the amount
approved will be made available to the Bank to finance project implementation, based upon the subproject's
technical design and compliance with MFEC eligibility and cost effectiveness criteria. Disbursement of funds
for implementation will require: i) approval by the Bank of the subproject's detailed implementation
arrangements; ii) demonstration by the enterprise that it possesses the requisite financial ability to use the grant
productively; and iii) execution of a subgrant agreement between FES and the beneficiary enterprise. The basis
for the Bank's final approval will be a review and approval of the Project Documents and the draft Subgrant
Agreement. The Bank and UTO will appraise subprojects to ensure that all technical, cost and implementation
issues raised before, during, or after OORG review and MFEC approval have been addressed
Subgrant Agreement. After the Subproject Appraisal Report has been approved by the Bank, ACCI
will finalize the Subgrant Agreement. The final draft Subgrant Agreement between ACCI and the beneficiary
enterprise will follow a standard model approved by the Bank. Disbursement may proceed after Subgrant
Agreement signature.
Subproject Implementation. Enterprises will: i) be responsible for executing the subproject in
accordance with the agreed subproject implementation plan; ii) prepare and submit periodic progress reports,
consistent with Bank Project Monitoring Guidelines and including details of the procurement of goods and
services. ACCI will ensure that the beneficiary enterprises follow specified procurement procedures prior to
authorizing disbursements and UTO will monitor enterprise compliance with environmental and safety
standards including any equipment disposal agreements. UTO will notify the Bank of any significant delays
and problems with subproject implementation. As required, UTO will receive technical support for subproject
supervision from the Bank and consultants.
Subproject Completion. In conjunction with enterprises, UTO, will prepare a Subproject Completion
Report after implementation and start up of each subproject. A technical audit will be conducted by an
independent consultant to verify that the enterprise has successfully implemented the subproject, and achieved
the desired ODP phase out objective.



Page 27
ANNEX 8
Ozone Depleting Substances Phase Out
Guidelines For Preparation Of Project Documents And Completion Reports
A.    Project Documents (PD)
The Project Document, which will be the basis for review for funding approval of subprojects by UTO,
the World Bank, including OORG, and the MFEC, will be prepared according to the following guidelines for
Project Document content and format:
1.    Standard Cover Sheet. Brief project summary per standard cover sheet format. The summary must
specify aim of project, ODS phased out, substitute technology, and implementation time frame.
2.    Project Objectives. Brief description of project ODS/ODP phase out objectives. Specify if the project
is new or has already been implemented. Indicate quantity of ODS (expressed as ODS and ODP) phased out,
directly attributable to the subproject, on an annual and total basis.
3.     Sector Background. i) Consumption of ODS in the sector: Include recent growth trends and latest
available official information on the sector - ensure that the ODS used in the Sector reflects latest informaaon
endorsed by the govemment, as the ODS use in the Country Program might not be up to date; ii)Description of
all major manufacturers/users in the sector, iii) Impact of project on ODS consumption for achieving 1999
freeze - Table on ODS consumption and impact of approved projects to be provided by the country; and iv)
Current status of regulatory action, policy changes, etc. Include restrictions on ODS use, or tariff or revenue
measures recently announced.
4.    Enterprise Background.  i) Brief history of the enterprise including financial performance; ii)
Percentage of domestic ownership; iii) Production profile and brief process or production description; iv)
Include table of last three years annual production; v) Export profile, if any.
5.    Project Description. Existing equipment briefly described.  Full description of project scope,
technology, and source of supply, divided into: i) components relating to ODS phase out and ii) other
components, such as expansion of output or product upgrading. Baseline information per PD Annex 5.
6.    Justification for Selection of Alternative Technology. Review of technical feasibility of subproject
should describe the before implementation and projected post implementation situations. A complete
equipment list including one line specifications and cost quotations/estimates will be shown in PD Annex 5. If
relevant, the issue of conversion to transitional substitutes such as HCFCs should be addressed here; wordiig
could be as follows : "the enterprise has been informed of the interim nature of technology, and will not seek
additional funding from MPMF at a later date to convert to zero-ODP technologies".
7.    Project Costs. Total estimated subproject costs, including non incremental costs, desegregated into: (i)
one-time capital and training costs; (ii) annual estimates of net operating costs or savings, if any, for the first
four years of operation; (iii) retroactive expenditures eligible for reimbursement, if any. A 10% price
contingency will be added to arrive at the total cost estimate.
8.    Calculation of Incremental Operating Costs (ioc). Calculation is shown in PD Annex 2. Production
level must be based on the most recent full year or the average of the last three years of production, and using



Page 28
current and projected production costs. Incremental costs should be calculated for the full period of eligibility
allowed by the ExCom for the given sector, even if the resulting total exceeds the sectoral threshold value.
9.    Cost Effectiveness (ce). Calculated CE in terms of US$/kg ODP/yr. to be presented here and on cover
page and compared with sectoral CE threshold (calculation shown in PD Annex 3).
10.    Proposed Multilateral Fund Grant. Grant amount will be based on eligible incremental costs, adjusted
for non-national ownership and exports to non-Article 5 countries.  Neither capacity expansion nor
technological upgrades can be financed by the MPMF. If either or both is incidental to conversion to non-ODS
technologies, deductions from total cost to arrive at eligible incremental cost will be made on a case by case
basis. The baseline information in PD Annex 5 should be sufficient to evaluate and justify the proposed grant
amount. The Financial Agent's Fee is not to be included in calculating the proposed grant.
11.    Project Implementation. The implementation schedule should include realistic lead times for MPEC
approval, appraisal and Sub Grant Agreement signing before date of first disbursement. Indicate any non-
conventional procurement arrangements (e.g. sole source procurement) if already known.
12.   Environmental Assessment Indicate nature of environmental impact, required mitigation, and type of
clearances likely to be required.
13.   OORG Technical Review. Attach final OORG approval.

ANNEX 9
Ozone Depleting Substances Phase Out
Eligibility Criteria, Incremental Costs, And
Sectoral Cost Effectiveness Thresholds
The following are the general eligibility and cost effectiveness criteria which subprojects must meet in
order to be eligible for financing from the Ozone Projects Trust Fund (OTF). These guidelines are indicative in
nature, and subject to interpretation depending upon the circumstances of ind.vidual subprojects, and specific
decisions of the MFEC.
A.    General Subproject Eligibility Criteria
Selection of subprojects will be consistent with eligibility criteria, and sectoral cost effectiveness
thresholds established by the MFEC. To be eligible for funding consideration, projects must result ir a
direct and demonstrable reduction or elimination of ODS consumption in Mexico; should be cost
effective; and based on environmentally sound, commercially available definitive zero ODP o.r
transitional low ODP substitute technologies for the substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol.
B.    Definition of Eligible Incremental Costs
OTF Grant amounts are based on the evaluated incremental capital and operating costs of an ODS
reduction or elimination phase out proposal.
Incremental capital costs are defined as the difference between the total costs of installing replacement
non-ODS technology of similar capacity and sophistication as the existing ODS technology, less the
normal replacement investment costs which would have been incurred to maintain the existing
technology at its current operating level.
Incremental operating costs are defined as the net operating costs for the non-ODS technology less the
net operating costs of the ODS technology. In cases where there are no significant incremental
operating costs, the OTF grant amount will be based on the incremental capital costs.
The total incremental costs will equal the net present value of incremental capital costs plus the net
discounted incremental operating cost. To determine OTF grant amounts, incremental costs will be
adjusted to reflect the local share of ownership, exports, and sectoral cost effectiveness thresholds.
Duties and Taxes. Import duties and other direct taxes are not considered as incremental costs and ; re
not eligible for OTF grant funding.
The detailed indicative list of categories of eligible incremental costs is given in Annex I of the London
Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, and is reproduced in Annex VIII.3 of "Policies, Procedures, Guidelines
and Criteria of the MF for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol" of February 1997.

C.     Cost Effectiveness
The cost effectiveness (or efficiency) of the financial mnechanism is a measure of how efficient it has
been in utilizing funds put at its disposal to meet its objectives. The most simple method used to
calculate cost-effectiveness of subprojects calculates total incremental costs of a subproject, excluding
cost of safety where applicable, divided by the amount of its Ozone Depleting Potential (ODP) to oe
phased out. Cost effectiveness is defined by the following formula:
C= IC+IO_
M [ODP]
where:
C              =      Cost-effectiveness
IC                    Incremental capital costs (covered by the Fund)
IO             =      Net incremental operating costs (covered by the Fund)
M [ODP]               Amount of ODS to be phased out annually (weighted kg ODP)
D.     Cost Effectiveness Thresholds
The following sector and subsector cost-effectiveness threshold values will be applied to determine maximum
eligible OTF Grant amounts for subprojects submitted to the MFEC. No threshold amount for commercial
refrigeration user conversion subprojects has as yet been defined.

Major Project Components:
Under the project, grant funding will be extended to subprojects for the Phaseout of ozone depleting
substances (ODS) in all sectors for which sectoral guidelines have been approved by the MFEC.
Major Environmental Issues: (Identified or suspected in project)
The project deals with existing enterprises and relatively small quantities of ozone depleting
substances.  There are potential safety issues associated with substitute chemicals.  Also, other
environmental impacts may include the atmospheric release of substitute chemicals, in particular
hydrocarbons.
Other Environmental Issues: (of lesser scope associated with project)
There may be some environmental issues depending on the alternative chosen to replace the ozone
depleting substance. An example would be the use of aqueous-based substitutes in solvent subprojects,
thereby increasing wastewater discharge.
Proposed Actions: (to mitigate issues described above)
Sponsoring enterprises will be responsible for meeting emissions standards, preparing impact
statements and obtaining environmental clearances as required by Colombian law, and consistent with World
Bank environmental guidelines. Ministry of Environment will assure that subprojects have complied with
the above environmental requirements before subprojects are officially submitted to the Bank for OORG
approval. Also, extensive safety reviews and training will be provided by international experts and
incorporated in the subprojects, as the case may require.
