INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO ENERGIE ELECTRIQUE DE LA COTE D'IVOIRE
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE REPUBLIC OF THE IVORY COAST
FOR A FIRST POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Energie Electrique de la Cote d'Ivoire with the guarantee of the
Republic of the Ivory Coast for the equivalent of US$33.0 million to help
finance a first power project. The loan would have a term of 17 years'
including four years of grace, with interest at 8.25 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.          The Report No. 1147b-IVC "Ivory Coast.  A Basic Economic Report"
was circulated to the Executive Directors in May 1977. Its principal findings
and conclusions, updated by Bank missions which visited the Ivory Coast in
October 1978, February and October 1979, are incorporated in the following
paragraphs. Annex I provides basic country data.
Past Performance
3.          Throughout the 1960-s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at a high
annual rate of about 8.3 percent; however, during 1971-75, economic growth
slowed to an average of 5.6 percent per annum partly because of the effects
of adverse climatic conditions in the early years of the period, the impact of
worldwide recession, and partly for structural reasons. In 1977, per capita
GNP reached US$710, one of the highest in Africa. The good overall perfor-
mance of the Ivorian economy over the last 17 years has resulted from a
combination of the following factors: large agricultural potential and
early identification by the Ivorian Government of the best opportunities for
developing this potential; liberal government policies vis-a-vis foreign
private investment as well as importation of foreign labor and managerial
talent; and generally adequate public finance performance and availability of
external aid.
4.          Favorable ecological conditions in the southern region give the
Ivory Coast comparative advantages in the cultivation of tree crops (par-
ticularly cocoa and coffee) and in the exploitation of timber resources.
1/     Substantially identical with Part I of the President's Report No.
P-11476-IVC for a North-East Rural Development Project.



From the early years of independence, the efforts of the Government were con-
centrated on the agricultural and forestry sectors. Large investments were
made in transport infrastructure to open up new forestry and agricultural
areas, and in agricultural research programs. Adequate guaranteed producer
prices and other incentives were introduced to which a dynamic smallholder
subsector has responded well. Government-owned large-scale plantations with
outgrower components were developed for oil and coconut palm.  Rapid growth has
been achieved in the production of cotton, pineapple, palm, and coconut oil,
cocoa and coffee. For the last two years, Ivory Coast has been the world's
largest producer of cocoa and the third largest producer of coffee.
5.          A long period of political stability, combined with the free
transferability of profits and capital, has created an aura of confidence
abroad which assured access to foreign capital. However, the necessary tech-
nical skills to foster the planned development were lacking in the country,
and the Ivorian community welcomed the wide variety of foreign managerial
and technical assistance which rapid growth required. A member of the franc
area and a strong supporter of monetary and economic cooperation, the Ivory
Coast has always been willing to welcome new regional institutions; it joined
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and has helped promote
the CIMAO project, which is the first regional industrial undertaking involving
both French and English speaking countries in West Africa. An important
feature of this cooperation with neighboring countries, which has been bene-
ficial to all parties concerned, is the large influx of unskilled labor
from less well endowed Sahelian countries, particularly Upper Volta and
Mali. In 1976, the foreign population of the Ivory Coast (mainly non-Ivorian
Africans) was 1.5 million, i.e. about 25 percent of the country's total
population.
6.          The factors mentioned above have enabled the external sector
to grow rapidly, and the value of exports and imports increased more than
six times from 196.0 to 1975. The trade balance during this period was
positive and amounted to 14 percent of export earnings. However, the deficit
on nonfactor services, workers' remittances and direct investment income
has never allowed a surplus on the current account. The most noticeable
aspect of export earnings in recent years has been the high prices received
for coffee which increased by 60 percent in 1976 and a further 120 percent
in 1977, and those for cocoa which increased by 20 percent in 1976 and a
further 66 percent in 1977. Total exports receipts more than doubled from
1975 to 1977, when they reached approximately US$2.7 billion. However,
merchandise imports increased by 70 percent between 1975 and 1977 to US$2.2
billion, partly in response to the import requirements of the increased public
investment program (see paragraph 7 below). The deficit on services and
transfers also increased at a rapid pace, amounting to more than US$800
million in 1977, but net capital inflows of approximately US$500 million
allowed a foreign exchange reserve build-up of US$200 million.
7.          The success of the Ivorian economy is to a substantial extent
attributable to generally sound government policies regarding public finance



- 3 -
and external aid. The public sector generated savings which, after debt ser-
vice, financed about 50 percent of the public investment program.  The level
of public investment is projected in the five-year plans and implemented
through a series of rolling three-year investment programs and annual invest-
ment budgets. The 1976-80 Plan called for public investment of about US$5
billion, the equivalent of about 30 percent of projected GDP (compared to 23
percent during 1971-75). The main objectives stated in the Plan were to
further increase production in developed regions, develop agriculture in poor
Savannah areas, accelerate the opening up of the southwest, and substan-
tially increase social services.  Since 1977, however, public investment has
increased substantially beyond what was envisaged in the Plan as funds became
available from coffee and cocoa export receipts and as the country borrowed
extensively abroad. New investments were programmed to expand education and
other social services, to develop sugar production into a major industry, and
for a variety of projects in transportation, energy and other fields.  State
enterprises have played a substantial role in this expansion, especially in
that portion financed by external credit. The increased reliance on external
capital is reflected in total external debt (disbursed and undisbursed) which
stood at US$1.5 billion at end 1975, US$2.2 billion at end 1976, and US$3.6
billion at end 1977. The implications of the sharp rise in external public
debt are discussed below (paras. 13 through 16).
Recent Development Issues
8.          To maintain the momentum of recent years and help broaden the
access to the benefits derived from it, the Government will need to persevere
in existing policies designed to diversify the economic base, improve income
distribution, increase the participation of Ivorian nationals in the manage-
ment of the economy, and maintain a public investment program of appropriate
dimensions. Current government policies are directed with some success to pro-
tecting the export-oriented economy against fluctuations in world market
prices and to promoting more balanced regional development. Agriculture re-
mains the most important sector, but the share of manufacturing in GDP has in-
creased from 4 percent in 1960 to 13 percent in 1976. Within agriculture,
the production of new crops such as bananas, pineapples, rubber, cotton, co-
conut and palm oil has been encouraged, resulting in a decline of the share of
cocoa and coffee in agricultural exports from 72 percent in 1960 to 51 per-
cent in 1976. In 1977, a year of very high coffee and cocoa prices, these
commodities' share of exports rose to 60 percent. As part of a more balanced
regional development policy, large infrastructure investments are underway
in the southwest in an effort to develop access to that potentially rich
region.
9.          Better income-earnings opportunities are being provided for the
population in poor rural areas in the north following the identification and
cultivation of improved varieties of cotton, and the promotion of ox-drawn
methods of farming. Income distribution is being further improved by in-
creases in agricultural producer prices, implementation of wage policies
which favor the urban poor, and execution of regional investment programs.
As a result, income inequality has diminished in recent years, with the
poorest 40 percent of the population currently receiving about 20 percent of
total income.



-4-
10.         Progress in the Ivorianization of capital and labor remains
limited. While agriculture is almost entirely in Ivorian hands, foreign owner-
ship is still important in forestry, industry, and modern commerce. However,
education and training are given very high priority in the allocation of
government resources; increasing recognition is given to the employment po-
tential of the informal sector and the Government is sponsoring a variety
of programs designed to promote the development of small-scale industrial and
commercial enterprises.
11.       These new policy directions are being implemented at some cost.
The development of new products, new sectors, and new regions yields de-
creasing returns on investments. For example, agricultural diversification is
being extended to crops with lower comparative advantage; reforestation
programs have to be implemented in order to avoid a complete depletion
of the reserves by the end of the century; the best opportunities for import
substitution in industrial development are becoming exhausted; heavy infra-
structure and productive investments in the potentially rich but sparsely
populated southwest yield initially low returns; large programs to improve
living conditions in the north and other poor rural areas involve long gesta-
tion periods. Finally, the direct and indirect costs of foreign production
factors are increasing.
12.       The financial burden of the expanded public investment program has
also increased despite the funding of a large proportion from the exception-
ally large surpluses accumulated in 1976 and 1977 in the stabilization fund
(equivalent to about US$1.5 billion). Thus, the program still relies on
external credit for 40 percent of its funding, about 85 percent of which
comes from private banks and suppliers. This represents a large increase
from previous years. The overall terms and conditions of external public
debt are hardening, reflecting increased reliance on commercial credit, and
the grant element of public and private lending to the public sector de-
clined from 29 percent in 1969 to 10 percent in 1978. The increased costs
of development, the larger scale of investment now being undertaken and
envisaged for the future and the heavy reliance on foreign commercial credit
to fund a major portion of investment point to the necessity of measures to
ensure that the limits of absorptive capacity are not exceeded and that re-
payment capacity is not strained. The substantial decrease in external
borrowing during 1978 when commitments were US$700 million, or one-half the
amount committed in 1977, is an encouraging sign that the Government of
Ivory Coast is aware of the situation. Other recent measures include a much
stronger control by the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA) over the state
enterprises borrowing and investment programs.
Prospects
13.       Provided the Government becomes more selective in determining in-
vestment priorities and limits external borrowing to prudent levels, the
medium- and long-term prospects of the Ivorian economy remain favorable
and an annual rate of growth of about 6 percent is a feasible objective for
the eighties.



-5-
14.       The economy has considerable potential for further development of
traditional export crops. MIoreover, after large initial investments have
been made, output of new products and developnent of new regions will start
to yield substantial benefits and can later be expanded at reasonable eco-
nomic cost. The Government is planning to review the system of protection
and tax holidays which has encouraged some marginal import-substitution
industries, and there is scope for expansion of export oriented processing
of local raw materials. Finally, many aspects of the country's policies
of income distribution (preference for the family-size farm, programs to
increase agriculture productivity in the poorer north, and the pronotion
of the informal sector, small-scale industrial and commercial enterprise)
are fully compatible with sustained economic growth.
15.       Prices for coffee and cocoa are decreasing and export earnings will
probably be considerably less buoyant in the near future than in past years
despite some mitigating effects of diversification into export products
such as rubber, pineapples and industrial products. Imports, however, have
increased substantially and the large deficit on services wfill remain as long
as the country relies heavily on foreign factors of production. Thus pres-
sures on the balance of payments will renain. The size and financing of the
public investment program will be a key element in determining the extent of
these pressures. Expected decreases in cocoa-coffee prices by 40 percent over
the next five years combined with high debt service are also expected to put
pressure on public savings. Their contribution to the financing of the public
investments is expected to substantially decline from a high 60 percent in
1978.
16.       The authorities are therefore engaged in a review of new public
investments in relation to available public savings, official development
assistance and longer term commercial borrowing.  The aim is to carry out as
much as possible of high priority targets while achieving an external debt
structure consistent with the medium term balance of payments prospects of the
economy. By these means it should be possible to keep the debt service at
about 25% and to maintain creditworthiness for borrowing on IBPD terms.
17.       Of the total external public debt outstanding at the end of 1978,
18 percent was provided bilaterally by governments, 12 percent by inter-
national organizations (of which 51 percent by the Bank Group), and 55 per-
cent by private banks and bond issues, while 15 percent came in the form
of suppliers' credit. About half of the total capital not supplied by
international organizations came from four countries; France (26 percent),
USA (12 percent), Lebanon (5 percent), and the Federal Republic of Germany
(5 percent). France and the European Communities remain the principal
source of development assistance in grant form, accounting for about 2
percent of the flow of foreign assistance to the public sector.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE IVORY COAST
18.       Since 1968, when Bank Group operations in the Ivory Coast started,
lending has expanded rapidly and now includes thirty-eight loans totalling
US$526.8 million (including US$14 million from the Third Window) and an
IDA credit of US$7.5 million. Fourteen of these thirty-seven operations have
been for agriculture, supporting cotton, cocoa, rubber, oil palm and coconut
development; another US$9.4 million loan for a North-East Savannah Rural
Development project has been approved by the Executive Directors on March 27,
1980. There were six road projects. The remaining seventeen loans were for
education, telecommunications, the Abidjan sewerage and drainage system, water
supply, urban development, tourism development, small- and medium-scale
enterprises, a regional cement project and a regional railway project. IFC's
involvement includes participation in the Banque Ivoirienne de Developpement
Industriel amounting to US$423,500; a 10 percent equity investment, equivalent
to about US$880,000, in Etablissement R. Gonfreville (ERG), the largest
textile plant in the country; and a US$6.7 million investment in Societe
Ivoirienne d'Engrais S.A. (Siveng) to double the company's fertilizer plant
capacity to 120,000 tons per year; on March 27, 1980, IFC Board of Directors
approved an equity investment of US$446,600 and a US$2.9 million loan for MSO,
a flour milling company. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group
operations and notes on the execution of ongoing projects, with particular
reference to those which are encountering problems in execution and giving
rise to delays in disbursements.
19.       Bank operations in agriculture have been in support of the Govern-
ment's policy of crop diversification and promotion of exports, and have fol-
lowed the evolution of this policy towards giving more emphasis to developing
smallholder production. A smallholder rubber project was approved by the
Board in October, 1978, and a rural development project for the North-East
in March 1980. The Bank is presently helping in the preparation of two pilot
projects aimed at strengthening the agencies in charge of rural development in
the Center and the Southern regions, and is associated with the preparation of
a mechanization study and pilot scheme, carried out by the French CCCE, to
determine the feasibility of introducing mechanized farming. The reorganiza-
tion of the former crop-oriented institutions in the sector to become regional
development authorities has been the main cause of delay in the effectiveness
of the Bank's Grand Bereby Rubber II and Fourth Oil Palm loans. In June 1979
the Executive Directors approved the first Bank forestry project in the Ivory
Coast which consists of a 20,000 ha plantation program of short and medium
rotation hardwood species.
20.       Another important sector for the Bank is transportation.  The Bank
was closely associated, as executing agency, with the 1969 UNDP Transport
Survey of the Ivory Coast, which has served as a basis for determining future
priorities among transport investments. Thus far the Bank has financed six
road projects totalling $123.3 million. The first project was completed in
December 1974 with final costs falling within appraisal estimates. The OED
report on this project dated June 28, 1977 recommended, inter alia, that more
emphasis should be given to road maintenance. This had been picked up in the
third highway project. The second road project was satisfactorily completed



in September 1975, after an initial delay caused by project modification
and subsequent poor work organization for the construction component. The
third and fourth highway projects incurred substantial cost overruns which the
Government is covering; otherwise execution is proceeding satisfactorily.
The fifth highway project approved in FY76 will contribute to a further
improvement of the primary road network of the country. A feeder roads and
highway maintenance project was approved in December 1977. A highway sector
loan to finance a portion of the country's highway investment program for
1981-83 will be negotiated shortly. A railway project, focussing on the
improvement of the Bouake-Petionara section of the Abidjan-Ouagadougou
rail line, renewal of rolling stock, technical assistance and training,
was approved in FY78. A second railway project to complete the rehabilitation
from Petionara to Tafire has been prepared under the first project, and is
being appraised.
21.       The Bank has been closely associated with the Government's efforts
to modernize the education system, in particular, at the primary, secondary
and vocational levels, through two education projects. A third education
project covering primary teacher training, vocational training and informal
education in rural areas was approved by the Executive Directors in December
1979.
22.       The Abidjan sewerage and drainage project, approved in FY75, covers
the first phase of a ten-year government program to improve sanitation in
Abidjan. The Board approved, in FY78, a second project which includes the
second phase of the program and studies for the third. An urban development
project, whose primary aim is to help meet some of Abidjan's low income
housing and transport needs, was signed in December 1976. With respect
to the smaller towns, the Board approved in FY78 a secondary centers water
supply project. A second urban development project and another project for
water supply in secondary centers are being appraised.
23.       The proposed project would be the first project in the energy
sector financed by the Bank, and it includes financing for the preparation of
a hydropower project. Also, a tar sands development project is in the process
of preparation. An energy sector review will be undertaken during FY81. Its
main purpose would be to help the Government to formulate a coherent energy
investment policy and program.
24.       In view of the predominance of foreign ownership and management in
the private sector of the Ivorian economy, the Government is placing high
priority on strengthening local entrepreneurship. In support of this policy
the Bank extended a loan for the promotion of small-scale enterprises in FY76,
which has been followed up by an artisans, small- and medium-scale project
approved in March 1979. The Bank Group also provided support for medium-
scale enterprises through another local development finance company and two
lines of credit for hotel financing and technical assistance in the tourism
sector. In June 1976 the Bank extended a loan to the Ivory Coast in support
of the CIMAO project which is sponsored jointly by the Governments of Ghana,
Ivory Coast, and Togo. CIMAO will utilize limestone deposits in Togo for the
production of clinker for the cement market of the three countries.



- 8 -
25.       The Bank Group's lending in the Ivory Coast has increased steadily
from a yearly average of below US$20 million during the early years to an
average of US$74.2 million annually in the 1975-79 period. The average an-
nual lending rate is expected to continue to grow substantially over the next
few years. The Bank Group's share of the Ivory Coast's external debt at the
end of 1978, stood at approximately 10.1 percent (including undisbursed). Its
portion of external debt disbursed is expected to rise from the present 6.4
percent to about 10 percent in the next ten years; its share of total debt
service, at present 4.2 percent, is expected to go up to about 7.0 percent
in the early 1980's.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Sector
26.       The Ivory Coast imports more than 50 percent of its energy require-
ments. The local sources of energy currently exploited are hydroelectric
power and firewood. The prospects for increasing the use of the local forests
are limited, but the hydroelectric power potential (about 10,000 GWh) is still
largely untapped. Other sources of energy, such as oil and ocean thermal
energy conversion, are being explored but findings of oil deposits so far have
been limited (estimated at 75 million tons of which only one-third is com-
mercially exploitable) and the technology for converting ocean thermal energy,
with which the Ivory Coast is exceptionally endowed, can not yet be counted
for planning purposes. Current plans for the exploitation of oil reserves
call for production of about one fourth of domestic consumption through the
early 1980's. These plans will be reviewed later as further technical infor-
mation becomes available. In these circumstances, the country would have to
rely on increased use of its hydroelectric potential and forests and imported
oil to meet its energy requirements in the medium term.
Sources of Electric Power
27.       Electric power is generated by four hydroelectric plants, a
single steam plant and many small diesel plants scattered throughout the
country, mainly in the northern region. All existing hydro-plants, the
steam plant and a minority of the diesel stations are part of an intercon-
nected grid which has been building up around Abidjan. Two of the hydro-
plants, with an installed capacity of 50 MW, were commissioned in 1959 and
1965. A third hydro-plant at Kossou with an installed capacity of 180 MW
was commissioned in 1972, but due to an extremely poor hydrologic cycle the
reservoir has not filled up as programmed and is producing less than 100
GWh/year, well below the expected average annual output of 500 GWh. Fortu-
nately, for the first time since 1972, the 1979 rainy season was normal in
the Kossou catchment area and the reservoir level increased significantly,
raising hopes that it could be filled by 1987 at the latest. The fourth
plant, at Taabo, was commissioned in 1979 with an installed capacity of 210
MW. At present, 366 towns and villages receive electricity supply covering
over one third of the 3.4 million people living in them.

28.       In 1973, following the oil price increase, the Government decided
to accelerate and give priority to the hydro-power investment program in
order to reduce the country's dependence on imported oil. Apart from the
Taabo plant which has just recently been put in operation, two hydro-plants
are now in the pipeline: the Buyo plant, to be commissioned in 1981 with 165
MW installed capacity and 900 GWh annual generation, and a plant at Soubre,
downstream from Buyo, which is being studied to establish its feasibility;
depending on the Kossou dam's future power generation and future power demand
in the Ivory Coast, the Soubre plant (1500 GWh per annum) would be commissioned
in 1985 or the late 1980's. These investment decisions, although based on
a sound rationale, have been made in the absence of an overall energy program
and often without sufficient consultation and input from EECI. A higher
degree of control by EECI on future power investments to be programmed within
the framework of an energy investment policy appears desirable and the Bank
would be helping in this direction in the course of the energy sector review
which the Ivorian government has asked us to undertake.
Institutional Aspects
29.       The major institution in the power sector is Energie Electrique de
la Cote d'Ivoire (EECI), created in 1952 as a stock company. The current
ownership of EECI includes the State (79%), Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique (CCCE) and Electricite de France (16%) and some private share-
holders (5%). As a private company, EECI is subject to the civil and commer-
cial code of the Ivory Coast; as a public undertaking, it is also amenable in
some respects to the administrative law. In this context, EECI is under the
general supervision of the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Plan, who has a
Commissaire appointed to the Board of Directors with veto power over all Board
decisions.
30.       EECI operates under the "concession" system widely used in French-
speaking countries. The concession agreements under which EECI operates
are defective in a number of respects, though the deficiencies have not
hampered the company's operations. EECI's original concession was for the
Abidjan-Bingerville area, and should have been amended or repeated for each
new expansion of the system. However, such action was rarely taken, and
EECI operates in all but a few centers it serves without any formal authority.
Similarly, no concession agreement exists for the State-constructed Kossou
dam (though a financing convention was executed). Where agreements do exist,
the concessions are not for uniform periods, varying from 40 to 75 years.
31.       Although the concession status might be considered largely academic,
in view of the State's majority shareholding, both the Ivorian Government and
EECI have agreed to update and modernize the concession system and to extend
it to the whole national territory to rectify the existing deficiencies and
anomalies. (Sections 4.06 and 3.02 of the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements,
respectively).



- 10 -
32.       EECI operations are run efficiently.  The General Manager, appointed
by the Ministry of Finance, is an energetic and able Ivorian who has held
office for over 10 years. The senior staff of EECI is competent. Although
the number of Ivorian nationals is steadily increasing, shortages remain
in some technical and professional disciplines, which are filled by expatriates.
At present, there are 69 expatriates out of 218 managers and technicians, a
much lower proportion than a decade ago (43 out of 52). All department heads
are now Ivorian. EECI management is committed to continue improving the
Ivorian participation in the company in line with the national objective to
Ivorianize the country's management. The proposed project would help, through
the training component, achieve this objective.
Tariffs
33.       From 1952 to 1964 EECI had several tariffs based on the cost of
supply in each area. During that period average rates fell by about 50
percent reflecting economies of scale. In 1964 new uniform tariffs for the
whole country were introduced with a further average drop of about 5 percent.
In 1969 a surcharge on the tariff was imposed to establish a fund to finance
rural electrification. In 1972, following a comprehensive tariff study an
indexed formula based on production costs was introduced. Consequently,
tariffs were raised by 30 percent in 1973, 18 percent in 1974, and 9.4 percent
in 1975, mostly because of fuel oil price increases. From 1976 to 1979
tariffs were frozen and EECI was granted a subsidy to compensate for the
increases in the cost of fuel oil. Effective November 1, 1979, EECI was
allowed to raise its tariffs by an average 20% and to apply automatically
(i.e. without prior approval of the Council of Ministers) the index formula
devised in 1973. This measure, in turn, eliminates the need for the oil
subsidy to EECI which will be discontinued by the end of 1980.
34.       In order to have a better base for future tariff adjustments,
EECI has started under the proposed project a comprehensive tariff study which
will take into account the new costs of production factors (mostly oil),
the accelerated hydroelectric investment program, and the new patterns of
consumption, to identify corrective measures both in the structure and level
of tariffs. EECI has agreed to discuss the recommendations of this study
before their implementation (Section 3.06 of the draft Loan Agreement).
EECI Financial Situation and Prospects
35.       For many years EECI had small operating surpluses, but with rising
fuel costs and low productivity of the Kossou hydro-plant, profitability
declined. In 1973, the company made a net loss of about $1.0 million but
annual tariff adjustments restored the situation until 1976, when tariffs were
frozen. In 1976/77, EECI just broke even but its accounts for 1977/78 showed
a substantial deficit of about US$10 million. A larger deficit is expected
for 1978/79. This situation has led EECI to increase its debt, particularly
bank overdrafts which amounted to about US $30 million by the end of 1977/78.



- 11 -
36.       One of the major objectives of the project is to restore the financial
soundness of EECI and, thus, of the power sector. To this end it has been
agreed with EECI and the Government that the company should be able by 1982/83
and thereafter to finance at least 25% of its investment program out of
internally generated cash (Section 5.05 of the draft Loan Agreement). The
recently adopted measures, which include an average 20% increase in tariffs
with automatic adjustments in accordance with an index formula (see para 33)
and the compensation of EECI's deficits in 1977/78 and 1978/79 by the Govern-
ment, are important steps to achieve the agreed financial target. Our projec-
tions of EECI show, however, that either further increases in tariffs, over
and above the increases resulting from the application of the index formula,
or a substantial increase in EECI's equity capital, together with feasible
increases in EECI's productivity will be required to achieve the 25 percent
self-financing ratio. EECI and the Ivorian Government are aware of this and
resolved to take appropriate measures.
37.       Other financial covenants include a maximum debt service ratio and
a limitation on short-term debt to 5 percent of EECI's gross revenues (Section
5.04 of the draft Loan Agreement). Also, as a monitoring and management tool,
EECI has agreed to establish by 1980/81 a system of pro-forma records to
estimate the current values of its net fixed assets year by year, using
conventional depreciation rates, and to calculate a notional rate of return
achieved each year on that basis. It is expected that these agreements will
safeguard the financial viability of EECI, and the power sector, and will help
foster a rational development in the future.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
38.       The proposed project would help finance a component of EECI's 1981-
84 rural electrification project, rationalize the power sector development,
and strengthen EECI's operating capability and financial position. The pro-
ject was appraised in November-December 1978, with short follow-up missions
afterwards. Loan negotiations with EECI took place in Washington on January
10-11, 1980; the EECI delegation was led by Mr. Lambert Konan, Director General
of EECI. Negotiations with Government were held in Abidjan on February 13-14,
and June 5, 1980; the head of the Government's delegation was Mr. Leon Naka,
Director General of the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement. The project is
described in detail in Staff Appraisal Report No. 2459-IVC dated June 18,
1980, which is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Supplementary data on the project is to be found in Annex III.
Project Concept and Description
39.       The proposed project aims at expanding the access of rural popula-
tion to electricity and modern life and at reducing the cost of producing
energy by replacing power generated in obsolete and small diesel plants by
power fed into the interconnected grid from hydro-plants and more efficient
thermal plants. Other important objectives of the project are to strengthen
the institution concerned, to increase the participation of Ivorians in the
management and operations of the sector and to redress the deteriorating
financial situation of the sector.



- 12 -
40.       The proposed project is part of the 1981-84 rural electrification
program which would link to the main Ivorian interconnected system 43 small
towns presently supplied from diesel stations, 633 small towns currently with
no electricity supply, and new or existing agro-industries currently sup-
plied with diesel generated electricity. Six "spider networks" will be
constructed around the towns of Man, Danane, Odienne, Seguela, Boundiali and
Ferkessedougou/Khorogo. The proposed project would consist of:
(a) construction of, and equipment and materials for, the spider
network of Man;
(b)  training of 45 Ivorian senior staff (engineers and technicians)'
(c)  equipment for the maintenance workshop.
(d) studies on tariffs, nationwide rural electrification planning,
urban distribution systems development; and
(e) completion of the Soubre hydro-plant feasibility study.
41.       The spider network centered in Man would involve the expansion of
the Man 90/33 kV substation, the erection of 1,425 circuit km of overhead
lines of low and medium voltage, the supply of 265 medium to low voltage
distribution transformers and low voltage consumers connection materials,
and consulting services for enginering, procurement and supervision of the
above. The training program would provide three-year scholarships for thirty
candidates in overseas engineering schools, and one-year training in main-
tenance operations for fifteen EECI senior technicians. The completion of the
Soubre hydro-plant feasibility study would involve the updating of the exist-
ing study and the review of alternative designs and technical solutions for
the project.
Costs and Financing
42.       The total cost of the 1981-84 rural electrification program is
estimated at US$151.2 million, of which about US$105.6 million in foreign
exchange. These costs exclude taxes from which the Government specifically
exempts EECI. The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$46.5
million (US$38.9 million for the spider network of Man and US$7.6 million
for training and technical assistance) of which about US$33.0 million in
foreign exchange. Of the US$7.6 million costs for training and technical
assistance, US$3.4 and $2.3 million refer to the costs of the training pro-
grams and studies specified above, respectively, and US$1.9 milli^r to the
equipment for the maintenance workshop to improve EECI's maintenance opera-
tions.  The average cost of consultants work is estimated at $115,000 per
man-year, including salary and benefits, income tax, overhead costs, housing
and transport. These costs are based on 1979 prices and include a 12 percent
allowance for physical contingencies and allowances for price contingencies of
12 percent in 1979, 10.5 percent in 1980, 9 percent in 1981, 8 percent in
1982 and 7 percent thereafter for the costs in foreign exchange and 11
percent in 1979, 10 percent in 1980, 9 percent in 1981, 8 percent in 1982,
and 7 percent thereafter for the costs in local currency.



- 13 -
43.        The proposed US$33.0 million loan to EECI would finance the foreign
exchange component of the project. The remaining US$13.5 million would
be financed from the proceeds of the Rural Electrification Fund (established
in 1969 by means of a surcharge on electricity tariffs), new consumers'
contributions and funds internally generated by EECI. The rest of the foreign
exchange requirements for the 1981-84 rural electrification program would be
financed by loans from CIDA and KfW together with Canadian and German commer-
cial banks. The local cost for the rest of the program would be financed from
the Rural Electrification Fund, new customers' contributions and EECI's
internally generated funds, except for the KfW project where local costs
financing is being considered.
Implementation
44.       EECI would be responsible for the execution of the project.  EECI
would contract a consulting firm under terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank for final project design engineering and preparation of bidding documents;
bids are expected to be called, opened and analyzed by the end of 1980 and the
project is expected to be completed by 1985. It is expected that EECI with
the help of the aforementioned consultants would execute the project efficiently.
Procurement
45.       Equipment, supplies, erection and related services to be financed
out of the proceeds of the proposed loan would be procured under international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines except for the
low voltage consumers' connections which would be installed by EECI's own
forces. These forces have been carrying out such connections for years and
are properly organized to implement adequately the estimated volume of work.
46.        Supply contracts would be separated from erection contracts.
Because of the scattered geographical distribution of the project facilities
and the labor intensive nature of the work, it seems unlikely that foreign
contractors not already established in Abidjan would be interested in bidding
for installation contracts. Bid packages therefore would be grouped by
voltage levels and each group could be awarded as a separate contract, making
it possible for smaller local firms to bid and thus increasing competition.
Disbursement
47.       The proposed loan would be disbursed to cover:
(a) 100 percent of CIF costs of imported equipment and materials;
(b) 23 percent of contracts for erection and other services, representing
the estimated foreign exchange component of such contracts;
(c) 70 percent of ex-factory costs of locally manufactured concrete
poles, representing the estimated foreign exchange component of this
item; and



- 14 -
(d) 100 percent of the cost in foreign exchange for consultant services
and training.
It is proposed to finance retroactively expenditures incurred after June 1,
1979, for the tariff studies, the Nationwide Rural Electrification study, and
the completion of the Soubre hydro-plant feasibility study, for an amount
not exceeding US$1.5 million.
Benefits and Risks
48.       The population to be served by the 1981-84 Rural Electrification
program is estimated at 890,000 in 1980 and 1.6 million in year 2000. About
60 percent of this population has no access to electricity at present. The
remaining 40 percent live in towns and villages of which only the larger ones
at the center of the proposed spider networks are assured 24-hour service by
the existing diesel stations. The program would help improve the quality of
life in the rural areas to be served and reduce the regional imbalance which
has traditionally favored the south.
49.       The proposed project would serve a population of about 315,000 by
1983, or 35 percent of the total population affected by the Rural Electrifica-
tion program. The economic rate of return for the whole program is estimated
at 15 percent and for the proposed project at 16 percent. The rates of
return for the other elements of the program vary from 8 percent to 28 percent
depending on the densities of the populations served and the amount of sunk
costs in transmission facilities already available in the surrounding areas.
An increase in price of fuel oil would also raise the economic rates of
return; for example, an increase of 20 percent would increase the rates of
return by about one percentage point.
50.       The proposed project does not face special risks.  EECI, with the
assistance of consultants, would be able to carry out the project efficiently,
and the cost of electricity to be supplied is well within what future users
can afford and are willing to pay for this service.
51.       The project is not expected to have an adverse environmental impact
as the work would consist of extension of subtransmission and distribution
lines in rural areas following conventional practices. In terms of safety,
however, the introduction of a new technique in the Ivory Coast (single
phase with earth return) may involve some risks; to minimize those risks,
EECI's distribution system technicians and operators will be trained by
Canadian specialists under CIDA financing to monitor ground voltages and
maintain them at acceptable levels. Also, to minimize the risk inherent in
the maintenance and operation of big dams, EECI has agreed to have such dams
inspected annually by qualified experts (Section 4.05 of the draft Loan
Agreement).

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Energie Electrique
de la Cote d'Ivoire, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic
of the Ivory Coast and the Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for
in Article III, Section 4 (iii), of the Articles of Agreement are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
53.       The draft Agreements conform generally to the normal pattern for
loans to power companies. Special conditions of the project are listed
in Section III of Annex III.
54.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
55.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. Projects in Execution 1/
Ln. No. 837           Third Highway Project:  US$17.5 million Loan of June 23,
1972; Effectiveness Date: May 4, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
The project was the first Bank's involvement in highway maintenance in the
Ivory Coast. The maintenance and betterment programs were successfully
completed in May 1977. The training and technical assistance programs were
being carried out under the Feeder Roads and Maintenance Project (Loan No.
1501), which continues the maintenance program undertaken under this project.
Ln. No. 981           Telecommunications Project:  US$25 million Loan of
May 3, 1974; Effectiveness Date:  January 31, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
The project has experienced a two-year slippage due mainly to management
and organizational changes and delays in appointing engineering consultants.
After the Government awarded the contract for switching equipment to other
than the lowest evaluated bidder, the amount earmarked under the loan to
finance the equipment (US$7.6 million, including contingencies) was can-
celled as of March 31, 1977 (R77-128). A 50 percent tariff increase for
telecommunication services, effective January 1, 1978, is expected to generate
the cash necessary for the Postal and Telecommunication Office to carry out
its expanded investment program.
Ln. No. 1069          Second Cocoa Project:  US$20 million Loan of January 10,
1975; Effectiveness Date: September 30, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980.
The project includes: establishing of 26,500 ha of high yielding cocoa planta-
tion, of which 9,500 ha would be planted in 76 blocks composed of individual
plots; providing technical assistance and credit to farmers; constructing
wells; constructing or rehabilitating access roads; and strengthening the
management. The project physical target has been met and SATMACI management
is satisfactory. The problem of quality of cocoa has been closely followed
and decisive progress in fermentation and drying techniques of cocoa have been
achieved. The financial situation of SATMACI is unsatisfactory as a result of
administrative delays in the payment of Government's contributions. Ways to
improve the situation have been recently discussed with SATMACI and the Min-
istry of Agriculture.
.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of the projects in execution and, in particular, to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 1077          Cotton Areas Rural Development Project:  US$31 million
Loan of January 17, 1975; Effectiveness Date: June 4,
1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
Initial delays in starting the feeder roads and the village water supply
programs have been made up. The development of cotton production is far ahead
of the appraisal estimates (36 percent). Improved food crop production is,
however, stagnating because of marketing problems. Some financial difficulties
are experienced this year because of depressed world market prices for cotton.
Disbursements are behind schedule due to the re-organization of CIDT's account-
ing system and the administration's slowness in processing the withdrawal
applications. Discussions between the Government and RMWA on these various
issues are underway.
Ln. No. 1124          Tourism Development Project:  US$9.7 million Loan of
June 11, 1975; Effectiveness Date: January 19, 1976;
Closing Date: September 30, 1981.
Project execution is progressing satisfactorily. The loan has been fully
committed.
Ln. No. 1125          Second Education Project:  US$5 million Loan of June 11,
1975; Effectiveness Date:  September 9, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
The project is almost completed.
Ln. No. 1161          Fifth Highway Project:  US$43 million Loan of September 5,
1975; Effectiveness Date: November 4, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
The pavement strengthening program was completed mid-1978 on schedule.
Construction work has been substantially delayed because of technical and
management difficulties. Consultants have started the engineering studies
provided for under the project. UNDP was originally to finance the updating
of the transport survey but cannot do so due to lack of funds. The Government
has agreed to amend the Loan Agreement to include financing of the survey in
this loan.

1975; Effectiveness Date: September 10, 1976; Closing
Date: December 31, 1980.
Three sub-projects have been approved; others are being prepared.
Ln. No. 1347          Urban Development Project:  US$44 million.  Loans
and 1348-T             (US$30.0 million and US$14 million on Bank and Third
Window terms respectively) of December 15, 1976;
Effectiveness Date: March 9, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
The execution of the project is progressing satisfactorily with regard to the
urban transport and sites components. The shelter component is still delayed
mostly because of slow administrative procedures in on-lending the proceeds of
the loan to the executing agencies.
Ln. No. 1382 1/       Fourth Oil Palm Project:  US$20 million Loan of March 30,
1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Ln. No. 1484           Secondary Centers Water Supply Project:  US$16 million
Loan of September 9, 1977; Effectiveness Date: June 9,
1978; Closing Date: September 30, 1981.
Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily on schedule.
Ln. No. 1490          Regional Railway Project:  US$23 million Loan of
November 14, 1977; Effectiveness Date: December 20, 1978;

Procurement is well advanced and the project is expected to be completed on
schedule.
