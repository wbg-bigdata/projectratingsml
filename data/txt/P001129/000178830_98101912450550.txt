IVORY COAST
Energie Electrigue de la Cote d'Ivoire (EECI)
First Power Project
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Ivory Coast Government and Energie Electrique de la Cote
d'Ivoire (EECI) have requested the Bank to participate with the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA) and the German Kreditanstalt fuer
Wiederaufbau (KfW) in the financing of EECI's 1981-1984 rural electrifi-
cation program in rural areas located in the northwestern region of the
Ivory Coast.  This program consisting of 6 independent components (or spider
networks) provides for the linking to the main Ivorian interconnected hydro-
power fed system, of about 676 small towns and villages with a total popula-
tion of 890,000 people; it will supply small towns and agro-industries
presently supplied at high cost from existing isolated diesel power stations
scheduled to be shut down, as well as small towns and villages to be newly
electrified. Total cost of EECI's 1981-1984 program is estimated to be US$151
million equivalent, including contingencies, with a foreign exchange component
of US$106 million equivalent.
1.02      The Government and EECI have asked the Bank to finance technical
assistance and the supply of equipment and materials and construction of one
of the six spider networks, in and around the town of Man, to serve approxi-
mately 315,000 people living in 172 townships and villages enabling 19 iso-
lated diesel power stations to be shut down. The total estimated cost of the
project proposed for Bank financing - including technical assistance - is
US$46.5 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$33 mil-
lion equivalent. The total local cost would be financed from the proceeds of
the Rural Electrification surcharge on tariffs and other consumer contribu-
tions, and from EECI's internal cash generation. The proposed loan would be
the first Bank lending operation for power in Ivory Coast.
1.03      The proposed Bank project has been prepared following a feasibility
study by TRACTIONEL (Belgium) completed in 1978. The Bank participated in
formulating both the 1981-1984 program and the project through identification,
preparation of the feasibility study's terms of reference, preappraisal and
appraisal missions in 1977-1978. The appraisal of the project was carried out
in November-December 1978 by Messrs. B.M. Thiam (Engineer), E.J.W. Gilling
(Economist), J.M. Boudier (Financial Analyst) and E.R. Williams (Consultant,
Financial Analyst). Mr. W. Cooper of the West Africa Projects Education
Division (WAPED) appraised the training requirements of EECI. This report is
based on the findings of the appraisal mission and incorporates substantive
subsequent developments.

II. THE POWER AND ENERGY SECTOR
Country Energy Outlook
2.01      Ivory Coast's total hydroelectric potential is estimated at 10,000
GWh of which less than 10% has been tapped so far. The forests also contrib-
ute substantially to domestic needs of firewood and charcoal. However, at
present these two sources which represent the only local sources of energy ac-
count for much less than 50% of total national energy requirements. Drilling
for oil (mainly off-shore) has been conducted and in 1977, a discovery was
announced but no production has taken place and the reserves seem to be of
modest size (about 75 million tons of which about 1/3 commercially exploit-
able). Potentials of future local energy resources are basically the sun,
on-shore mostly in the northern region and off-shore with ocean thermal energy
with which Ivory Coast seems to be exceptionally endowed. However, large
scale conversion to electricity of both on-shore and off-shore energy from the
sun is still in the developmental stage. In the meantime Ivory Coast has to
rely heavily on its forests (wood/charcoal), hydroelectricity and imports to
fill the gap. National consumption of petroleum products was slightly over
14 million barrels in 1977. Crude oil is refined at the Vridi refinery which
has a capacity of 1.9 million tons per annum and is currently being expanded
to 4.0 million tons per annum.
Sector Organization
2.02      Energie Electrique de la Cote d'Ivoire (EECI), created in 1952, is
responsible for providing public supplies of electricity in Ivory Coast.
EECI is under the "tutelle" of the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Planning.
The status of EECI's various concessions is incomplete, many of EECI's power
facilities being operated without the proper agreement with the Government
(Autorite concedante). A detailed review of EECI's legal status and recom-
mendations regarding its future are given in paras. 5.05-5.07.  Other aspects
of EECI's organization and overall management (personnel, training, operations,
accounting system, billing) are analyzed in Chapter 5 and EECI's past and
future finances in Chapter 6.
Electric Service Coverage
2.03      As of September 30, 1977, 366 towns and villages received electri-
city supply in-Ivory Coast from EECI. Some 3.4 million people representing
about 47% of the total population live in these towns and villages, and about
a third of these (i.e., 17% of the total Ivorian population) live in a house-
hold with a connection (see Annex 1). The Ivorian Government has always given
high priority to its objectives of rural electrification and improvement of
nationwide electricity service coverage; from 1960 to 1977 the number of urban
and rural centers supplied with electricity increased from 4 to 366 while the
electricity consumption outside the capital city grew from 9% to 35% of total
Ivorian consumption. EECI's 1981-1984 rural electrification program will
increase electricity service coverage in the country by about 8%.

The Market
2.04      The total electricity consumption and generation in 1977-1978
(October 1, 1977 to September 30, 1978) were as follows:
Table 2.1

Sources of Generation
Hydro                                                   204.3          14.9

2.05      The demand peaked in 1977 and 1978 in the interconnected grid at
189 MW and 216 MW respectively (see Annex 2). Total electricity consumption
in Ivory Coast increased at an exceptionally high rate of 20.7% per annum on
the average from 1960, independence year, to 1974 when electricity prices
had to be raised to cover the dramatic increase in oil prices. Subsequently
growth rates have been lower, only 2.4% in 1973-1974 and 11.4% per annum on
the average from 1973 to 1978. Sales outside Abidjan have grown faster, from
25% of the total in 1972 to 35% in 1977, reflecting EECI's penetration of the
interior. The total number of consumers increased about 15% per year from
44,549 in 1967 to 205,024 in 1978 while the per-capita consumption stood at
136 kWh per annum in 1977 and low voltage consumption reached an average of
2,380 kWh per customer per year in 1978, which is one of the highest in West
Africa.
Existing Facilities
2.06      The principal components of EECI's existing system are shown on
Map IBRD 14208. Present generating facilities (see Project File) consist of



-4-
four hydroelectric plants, a single steam thermal plant and several diesel
stations scattered in the country mainly in the northern regions; a 12 MW
gas turbine installed in the old diesel station located in Abidjan is only
used when required for peaking purposes. All existing hydro-plants, the steam
thermal plant and a minority of the diesel stations, including the Abidjan
station, are part of an interconnected grid which has been building up around
Abidjan in the southeastern and central regions of the country.
2.07      The first two hydro stations built in Ivory Coast were commissioned
in 1959 (2 units of 10 MW each) and 1965 (2 units of 15 MW each) on the
Bia River in the southeastern region of the country; with 50 MW installed, the
combined output of the two plants stands at 200 GWh in a year of average
hydrological conditions. In 1972, the Kossou hydro station on the Bandama
River was commissioned with 180 MW installed capacity (3 x 60 MW). The
Kossou reservoir has not filled since it was placed in service 1/ because
of the drought 2/ that affected the White Bandama River catchment upstream of
the Kossou site for several years. Instead of the annual 500 GWh the Kossou
hydro-plant should have generated it produced only 70 GWh in 1977 with serious
financial consequences for EECI (para. 6.22). Fortunately, for the first
time since 1972, the 1979 rainy season was normal in the Kossou catchment
and the reservoir level increased significantly raising hopes that Kossou
could be filled by 1987. The fourth plant, Taabo, which is located downstream
of Kossou on the Bandama River, was commissioned 3/ in 1979 (3 units of 70 MW
each, with an annual output of 1030 GWh); its commissioning combined with a
normal rainy season in 1979 helped increase EECI's total hydrogeneration to
455 Gwh in 1978/1979 or +123% from the year before. As of December 31, 1979,
the total installed capacity in hydropower was 440 MW; after commissioning of
the Buyo plant in late 1980/early 1981 the total installed hydro-capacity
would amount to 605 MW.
2.08      The thermal generating facilities are in large part installed in
Abidjan within the interconnected grid. The steam thermal plant of Vridi,
in the outskirts of Abidjan had its first unit (30 MW) commissioned in 1968,
the second (30 MW) in 1970 and the last two units of 75 MW each in 1976.
The old diesel station of Abidjan (1954), where a 12 MW gas turbine is the
only active component, is a stand-by station which would be shut down in
1/   The Kossou reservoir is not expected to be filled until late in the
1980's; until then it would not generate more than 100 GWh/year;
according to a 1978 study prepared by a French consultant chances
that the reservoir will be filled by 1985 and by 1987 are 50% and 90%
respectively.
2/   A severe drought from 1973 (a year after commissioning of Kossou) to
1978, in combination with the delay of two 75 MW units in the Vridi
thermal plant (which forced to use for hydro generation large parts of
inflowing water) contributed to the worsening of the water storage
conditions in the Kossou reservoir; in normal hydrological conditions,
the reservoir would have required about 6 years to be filled up.
3/   The first 70 MW unit was connected to the interconnected grid in February
1979; the other two units were in operation by June 30, 1979.



-5-
the coming years. All other diesel stations in the country are small and
scattered in remote areas except the Bouake station (5 MW), a stand-by
station for the second largest city of the country, which is supplied by the
interconnected grid in normal operation. As of September 30, 1977, the total
installed capacity in thermal plants feeding the interconnected grid was
235 MW; a total of 52 isolated diesel stations with 123 small units were
operating in Ivory Coast with a total installed capacity of 37 MW.
2.09      The length of transmission lines in operation as of September 30,
1977, was 1,128 km (288 km at 220 kV and 840 km at 90 kV) with a total of
14 high to medium voltage substations; the total length of subtransmission
(33 kV) and primary distribution lines (15 kV in cities) was 3,950 km, and
of low voltage lines 3,380 km; there were 2,342 medium to low voltage sub-
stations. All distribution systems in Ivory Coast have been designed and
constructed so far according to European triphase practice and standards,
even in rural areas.
Tariffs
2.10      EECI's tariffs shown in Annex 3 are analyzed in Chapter 6 (paras.
6.04-6.08). The average price of electricity in Ivory Coast during 1978-.
1979 was CFAF 22.43 (USg10.38) per kWh. On November 1, 1979 tariffs were
increased by an average of 20%; the new tariffs are comparable to overall
averages in West African Coastal Countries (USJ11.3/kWh in Guinea, USi11.0/kWh
in Sierra Leone, USJ11.0/kWh in Nigeria) but lower than overall averages in
West African landlocked Sahelian countries (USd20.6/kWh in Upper Volta, and
USJ27/kWh in Chad).
Sector Planning
2.11      To satisfy the high growth rate of consumption in Ivory Coast EECI
has been making plans for the development of the sector with the help of
foreign consultants. Electricite de France (EdF) has been the consultant
most frequently used by EECI; however, in recent years, EECI has been diver-
sifying the origin of its consultants (Canadians, Americans, Belgians).
EECI's development programs are always reviewed by the Government and after
approval are part of the five-year national economic and social plans.
2.12      Subsequent to the drastic oil price increases in 1973, the Ivory
Coast Government decided to develop the country's hydroelectric potentials in
order to reduce the country's dependance on imported fuel oil. One hydro
plant is now under construction, i.e. the Buyo plant to be fully commissioned
in 1981 with 165 MW installed and 900 GWh. A second hydro plant (Soubre down-
stream of Buyo) is being studied to evaluate its feasibility; depending on the
Kossou future generation and future power demand growth in Ivory Coast, Soubre
(1,500 GWh/annum) would be on line either in 1985 or late in the 1980's (see
Annex 2 and Map IBRD 14208). 1/ Transmission lines are being constructed in
connection with the above hydro-plant projects and also to supply remote areas
so helping shut down costly diesel stations. By the end of 1981, a total of
1,200 more km of 220 kV transmission lines are expected to be constructed.

-6-
Likewise, 90 kV lines and 30 kV subtransmission lines as well as distribution
schemes are being studied and constructed. EECI's 1981-1984 rural electri-
fication program is designed to extend subtransmission lines to supply rural
areas. EECI and the Government have asked assistance from the Bank to set up
(i) a plan of nationwide rural electrification and (ii) a plan of urban
distribution systems development in selected urban centers; the Bank was also
asked to help complete the feasibility study of the Soubre hydro plant.
These studies would be financed from the proposed Bank loan (para. 3.02).
EECI's Rural Electrification Program
2.13      EECI's 1981-1984 rural electrification program stems from the
Government's high priority objectives of (i) improvement of nationwide elec-
tricity service coverage by extending supplies to rural areas and (ii) reduc-
tion both of the country's dependence on expensive imported fuel oil and of
electricity supply costs in remote rural areas. The program provides for
the linking to the main Ivorian interconnected system (which is expected to
be principally hydropower fed by completion of the program in 1984) of:
-    43 small towns presently supplied from existing diesel stations
totalling 24.3 MW of installed capacity and planned to be
shut down;
-    633 small towns and rural areas presently with no electricity
supply; and
-    new or existing agro-industries currently supplied with diesel
generated electricity.
This is the first time in the Ivory Coast that rural electrification is being
planned for such a large geographical area.
2.14      Six "spider networks" will be constructed around the towns of Man,
Danane, Odienne, Seguela, Boundiali and Ferkessedougou/Korhogo as shown in
Map IBRD 14208. They will supply electricity to a total population of
890,000 people (see para. 4.01). The program's feasibility study was carried
out in 1978 by TRACTIONEL, a Belgian consulting firm, on the basis of terms of
reference prepared by the Bank and designed to respond to the Ivorian Govern-
ment and EECI objective of reducing rural electrification costs.
2.15      EECI's consultants in their search to reduce rural electrification
costs recommended single-phase (with two conductors) and single-phase (with
earth return) subtransmission lines for the outer fringes of the "spider net-
works". Because of the novelty of the single-phase concept to EECI's staff and
reservations expressed by some expatriate advisers, EECI's General Manager who
strongly supports this "new" design - which has been common practice for over
30 years in Australia and in Canadian western provinces such as Saskatchewan -
requested CIDA to sponsor and finance a seminar to address the technical and
economic merits of the change-in design as compared to an entirely three-phase
system more familiar to EECI's staff. A one week seminar took place in Ivory
Coast, organized by Hydro-Quebec and Canadian consulting firms and attended by
all EECI's managers and senior staff. The seminar reassured and convinced



- 7 -
most of EECI's staff. Furthermore, CIDA plans to help EECI with appropriate
trainers and training facilities to make the "new" design familiar to distri-
bution system technicians and operators.
2.16      Works to be constructed under the program from 1981-1984 include
447 km of 90 kV transmission lines, 5 substations of 90/33/15 kV with 10 high
to medium voltage transformers, 3,356 km of subtransmission lines, 1,282 km
of low voltage lines and 668 distribution transformers. Their estimated cost
is CFAF 31.8 billion (US$151.2 million equivalent) including contingencies
with a foreign exchange component of CFAF 22.2 billion (US$105.6 million
equivalent) (see Project File).
2.17      The 1981-1984 rural electrification program costs are broken down
as follows for financing purposes:

All preceding cost figures were developed by Bank staff from consultants'
estimates, reviewed and agreed with EECI's staff and the consultants. These
cost figures include appropriate physical and price contingencies but exclude
interest during construction and taxes for which the Government granted a
special exemption for the whole 1981-1984 rural electrification program.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
3.01      The main objectives of the project would be to help (i) finance a
component of EECI's 1981-1984 rural electrification program, (ii) rationalize
the power sector development, and (iii) strengthen EECI's operating capability
(training) as well as its financial position (including tariff related ques-
tions). The rural electrification component proposed for Bank financing
would supply electricity to about 315,000 people living in 172 small towns and
villages and would help shut down 19 isolated diesel power stations totalling
an installed capacity of 7.6 MW.



-8-
Project Composition
3.02      The project proposed for Bank financing would consist of (i) the
supply of equipment and materials and construction of the Man "spider net-
work", (ii) a training component, (iii) the equipping of a new maintenance
workshop, and (iv) the consulting services for the preparation of several
studies.
(a)  Man Spider Network
The  Man spider network would consist of:
(i)  the expansion of the Man 90/33 kV substations to feed
subtransmission lines;
(ii) the supply and erection of:
- about 280 circuit km of three-phase 33 kV overhead
lines;
- about 384 circuit km of single-phase 33 kV (with two
conductors) overhead lines;
- about 106 km of single-phase (with earth return)
19 kV overhead lines;
- about 265 medium voltage (33 kV or 19 kV) to low
voltage pole mounted distribution transformers; and
- about 655 circuit km of low voltage overhead lines
in small towns and villages;
(iii) the supply of low voltage consumers connection materials
(meters, circuit breakers, fuses, cables ...); and
(iv) consulting services for engineering, preparation of
bidding documents, analysis of bids and supervision of
construction.
(b) Training
EECI has well-equipped training facilities for skilled workers and
technicians (see para. 5.13) but cannot provide training for senior staff
about one-third of whom are expatriates. The training component of the proj-
ect, identified with the help of WAPED staff, would include 105 man-years
of bursaries for overseas training that would provide EECI with about 45
Ivorian senior staff (engineers and senior technicians). The Ivorian staff
trained under this program would replace part of the large number of expat-
riate senior staff in EECI. The training program would provide scholarships
for 45 senior technicians (from EECI staff) and/or high school graduates. Ten
candidates per year starting in 1980, 1981 and 1982 (a total of 30) would be



-9-
trained for three years in overseas engineering schools; in addition 15 senior
technicians from EECI staff would receive special training abroad for one
year (1981) in the preparation of maintenance schedules and carrying out
maintenance and repairs of hydro generating plants as well as 220 kV trans-
mission lines; this training would provide the management staff of a Central
Workshop which EECI intends to build. The project's training component also
includes an expansion of EECI's existing training facilities; this would
provide for additional accommodation for middle and upper-level personnel
(see para 5-13).
(c) Equipping of Maintenance Workshop (details in para. 3.08).
(d) Studies (details in paras. 3.09-3.10).
The project would include:
(i)  a tariff study;
(ii) a study of nationwide rural electrification planning;
(iii) a study of urban distribution systems development; and
(iv) additional consulting services to complete the feasibility
study of the Soubre hydro plant (para. 2.12).
Project Costs
3.03      The total project is estimated to cost CFAF 9,757.0 million
(US$46.46 million equivalent) including a foreign exchange component of
CFAF 6,966.0 million (US$33.17 million equivalent). These costs exclude
taxes for which the Government specifically exempts EECI. Costs are broken
down as follows (see development of project costs in Annex 4).

3.04      The project provides for CFAF 462 million (US$2.2 million equiva-
lent) or about 182 man-months (at US$11,500 per man-month including all
expenses) of consulting services for project design engineering and works
supervision of the Man spider network proposed for Bank financing. The tech-
nical assistance component amounts to CFAF 1,603 million (US$7.63 million
equivalent) with a foreign component of CFAF 1,351 (US$6.43 million equiva-
lent); a breakdown of technical assistance costs is given in Annex 5.
3.05      The project's base line costs in early 1979 prices were developed
by Bank staff on the basis of estimates prepared by TRACTIONEL. They are
reasonable, given the project terrain (mostly forest and hilly areas); a 12%
allowance has been provided for physical contingencies. Price contingencies
have been allowed separately for foreign and local components; for the foreign



- 11 -
component, the following rates were used: 12% in 1979, 10.5% in 1980, 9% in
1981, 8% in 1982 and 7% beyond 1982; for the local component, the rates were
11% in 1979, 10% in 1980, 9% in 1981, 8% in 1982 and 7% beyond 1982; for
training costs a 10% yearly rate was used, based on West Africa Project
Education Division's experience. These assumptions lead to an overall
allowance for price contingencies of 38.8% on the base line costs.
Project Financing
3.06      A Bank loan of US$33 million is proposed; this would finance the
foreign exchange component of the project. The loan would be made directly to
EECI. Total local costs amounting to about US$13.29 million equivalent would
be financed partly by proceeds of the Rural Electrification surcharge and
other consumer contributions and partly by EECI's internally generated funds.
Retroactive financing of US$1.5 million equivalent is recommended to cover
the foreign exchange component of (i) initial payments for engineering
consulting services which should start by mid-1980, (ii) payments for the
implementation of the tariff study (see para. 3.09), (iii) payments to
initiate the studies of the Nationwide Rural Electrification Planning, of
the Urban Distribution Systems Development and of the completion of the
Soubre hydroplant feasibility study (see para. 3.10).
Construction Schedule
3.07      EECI plans to hire a consulting firm by mid-1980 for project design
engineering and preparation of bidding documents; bids would be called,
opened and analyzed by the end of 1980. On the basis of these assumptions,
construction is scheduled to start in 1981 and the project to be completed by
1985 (see Project Construction schedule in Annex 6). Coordination of the
project execution (Man "spider network") with the construction of all other
components of EECI's 1981-1984 program is required for efficiency. EECI plans
to hire the same Canadian consulting firm for both the project proposed for
Bank financing and the Canadian financed component; this would improve coor-
dination of at least these two independent components of the program which are
located in close geographical areas.
Equipping of Maintenance Workshop
3.08      By the mid-1980's EECI will have tripled its installed hydro
capacity as of December 31, 1978 and by the end of 1981 the length of 220 kV
transmission lines in operation as of December 31, 1978 will have quadrupled.
For the maintenance of all these new facilities, EECI is planning to use its
own maintenance teams based in a Central Workshop to be constructed, thus (i)
eliminating the need for costly foreign services and (ii) improving EECI's
operations by setting up an organization with more discipline and more sys-
tematic maintenance schedules in hydro generation and transmission lines



- 12 -
facilities. The feasibility (including cost estimates) of this Central
Workshop for maintenance of generating and transmission lines facilities has
been studied by an expert from EdF; a detailed engineering design will be
carried out by a consulting firm by the end of June 1980. The proposed
project would provide for the equipping of this Central Maintenance Workshop
with machine-tools.
Studies
3.09      The need for a tariff study is indicated and justified in para.
6.08; this study was commissioned in April 1979 on the basis of terms of
reference discussed and agreed upon during appraisal (see Project File). The
study would require for its implementation about 15 man-months of consulting
services.
3.10      The study of nationwide rural electrification planning would propose
priorities in rural electrification and examine appropriate distribution
system design with a view to further reducing the cost of distribution system
beyond the level reached with the design recommended by EECI's consultants
for the 1981-1984 rural electrification program. Terms of reference of such
a study were discussed and agreed upon during appraisal (see Project File).
The study of urban distribution system development would help set up compre-
hensive investment programs; the 11 urban centers which would be considered
for this study are Abidjan, Bouake, Yamoussoukro, Daloa, Man, Gagnoa, Korhogo,
Abengourou, Divo, Dimbokro and San Pedro. EECI's management commissioned the
studies for nationwide rural electrification and for urban distribution
systems development - like the tariff study - in April 1979 for completion in
time for discussion with the Bank and the Government and for consideration in
the next five-year Government Economic and Social Plan (1981-1985). The
nationwide rural electrification study and the urban distribution systems
development study would require consulting services of about 55 man-months and
25 man-months respectively. To complete the feasibility study of the Soubre
hydro plant about 100 man-months of consulting services are required; terms of
reference for these complementary services were discussed and agreed upon with
EECI. During negotiations, agreement was reached that these studies as well
as other studies mentioned previously to be financed under the proposed
project will be carried out by consultants in accordance with Bank guidelines
and subsequently the conclusions and recommendations of the studies will be
discussed with the Bank before implementation.
Project Monitoring and Reporting
3.11      At present, EECI has a data acquisition program for rural electri-
fication statistics. However, the program is not adequate to gauge the
socioeconomic impact of the rural electrification and to allow future
planning. During negotiations monitoring criteria and reporting requirements
were discussed with EECI (see Annex 7) and assurances were obtained that EECI
will carry out the monitoring program and submit reports to the Bank on a
quarterly basis.



- 13 -
3.12      Since the project is dependent on the supply of electricity from
hydroelectric generating plants, agreement was reached during negotiations
that EECI will have the dams at each of the power sites inspected annually by
qualified experts.
Procurement
3.13      Equipment, supplies, erection and related services to be financed
out of the proceeds of the proposed loan would be procured under international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines except for
(i) concrete poles which are locally available and (ii) the low voltage
consumers' connections which would be supplied under ICB within the proposed
Bank loan and installed by EECI's own forces. These forces have been carrying
out such connections for years and are properly organized to adequately
implement the estimated volume of work.
3.14      Supply contracts would be separated from erection contracts.
Because of the widely scattered geographical distribution of the project
facilities and the labor intensive nature of the work, it seems unlikely that
foreign contractors not already established in Abidjan would be interested in
bidding for installation contracts. Bid packages would be grouped by voltage
levels and each group could be awarded as a separate contract, thus making it
possible for smaller local firms to bid, and increasing competition.
Disbursement
3.15      The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against the CIF costs
(100%) of equipment and materials, and the foreign exchange component (23%)
of erection and services. Disbursement for locally manufactured concrete
poles would be made on the basis of 70% ex-factory costs representing the
foreign exchange component. The estimated schedule of disbursement is as
follows:

Environmental Impact
3.16      The work consists of extension of subtransmission and distribution
lines in rural areas following conventional practices. Therefore, there would
be no adverse environmental impact. However, due to the introduction of the
"new" technique of single phase with earth return, EECI's distribution system
technicians and operators will be adequately trained by Canadian specialists
under CIDA financing to comply with certain minimum safety requirements e.g.
periodical checking of grounded resistance level (see Annex 7: Project
Monitoring Guidelines).
IV. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
Population to be Served
4.01      The population in the six areas to be served by spider networks
constituting the 1981-84 rural electrification program 1/ is expected to be
about 890,000 in 1980, with an average growth rate of about 3% p.a. (see
Table 4.1 for summary, project file for details). By the year 2000, the
population would then total 1.6 million. The population growth rate of the
six towns from which the spider networks radiate is forecast to grow at a
slightly faster than average growth rate, as experienced in recent years, of
about 4% p.a. The natural population growth rate in Ivory Coast is likely
to continue at its present rate of 2.5% p.a. until 2000, while immigration
contributes an additional 1.5% p.a.  The Government's ongoing support and
investment in rural development and infrastructure projects such as rural
electrification are expected to help to reduce the rural to urban migration
that has boosted the population growth rate of Abidjan to around 11% p.a.
during the 1970's.
4.02       At present, about 40% of the total population of the six spider
network areas lives in towns which are served by electricity provided by
diesel stations. Service is not available 24 hours per day, except in the
large towns at the center of the proposed spider network. The 1981-84 rural
electrification program would thus provide the opportunity for continuous
service to about 161,000 people in small centers already having part-time
service as well as giving access to service for the first time to 680,000
people.
4.03      The town of Man and the centers comprising the Man spider network
and the Bank subproject constitute the largest of the six spider network
areas. Man itself is expected to have a population of about 64,000 by 1980
(annual growth rate 5%), while the centers to be served by the spider network
will have 250,000 in 1980 (annual growth 2%). The Bank subproject is there-
fore concerned with a 1980 population of 315,000 or 35% of the total popula-
tion affected by the 1981-84 rural electrification program.

Consumption Forecast
4.04      The consultant has prepared reasonable consumption forecasts for
the six spider network areas by analyzing the growth in specific consump-
tion of low voltage customers in comparable centers which have been electri-
fied in previous rural electrification schemes. The specific consumption,
the estimated percentage of population likely to take house connections, and
the population to be served were then used to forecast the total domestic
consumption. High voltage consumption has been evaluated on the basis of an
enumeration of specific industrial activity in each area. The demand fore-
casts are summarized in Table 4.2 while details are given in the project
file 1/.
4.05      Total consumption in the program area is expected to grow from
the 1979 level of about 50 GWh/year (4% of total Ivory Coast electricity
consumption) to about 152 GWh/year in 1985, at an average growth rate of
20%. The average specific consumption per domestic consumers in the major
towns of the program which have been electrified for a minimum of 10 years
is currently 750 kWh/year and is rising about 50 kWh/year. Consumption per
domestic consumer is expected to begin at a level of between 60 and 100 kWh/
year in the small villages to be served by the spider network and would rise
by 25 kWh/year as usage of electricity diversifies to include small appliances
in addition to lighting. The percentage of population initially served in
the villages to be electrified is expected to be about 10-15% with a 3% in-
crease per year after electrification.
4.06      Street lighting in the villages to be electrified would constitute
about 20% of initial demand while in the larger towns at the center of the
spider networks, street lighting is now in the order of 10%. Professional
consumption (artisans, shopkeepers and small industries) on the other hand,
is more important in the towns, being about 25% of total consumption as
opposed to 15% in the villages.
4.07      The consumption forecast for the Man project area is shown graphi-
cally in Chart 4.1 and in detail in Annex 9. At present, the town of Man
accounts for 70% of total consumption in the area, but this percentage would
drop to 58% by 1985 as new centers are electrified and specific consumption
increases with the availability of continuous supply.
4.08      The total consumption growth rate in the town of Man has averaged
12% since 1975; however, this rate is expected to increase during the project
period to 18% as the local distribution network is extended and then return
to its present level after 1985.

4.09      Total consumption in the electrified rural areas will grow at high
rates (20-30% p.a.) from the present small base of about 3 GWh/year as elec-
trification progresses. After 1985, growth is expected to drop to 12% p.a.,
a more sustainable, normal growth rate.
Least Cost Solution
4.10      The least cost solution has been determined on the basis of a
25 year design horizon; thus, growth in demand has been considered in the
period 1980-2005. The consultant has used a computer model to design the
33 kV subtransmission network according to the overall electrification pro-
gram extending beyond the 1981-84 first phase. The model seeks to minimize
the total present value of investment and operating costs, subject to tech-
nical constraints. Complementary investments for extensions to the network
and reinforcements of substations which permit the growth of demand up to the
capacity of the facilities provided by the proposed project have, therefore,
been included.
4.11      The supply of energy to each spider network in the program area by
interconnection with the 220 kV grid has been demonstrated to be the least
cost solution. The marginal cost of energy until 1985 is 8.8 CFAF/kWh based
on thermal production. Beyond 1985, the long-run marginal cost 1/ is expected
to drop to 7.3 CFAF/kWh with the commissioning of the Soubre hydro plant which
will permit the suspension of thermal generation. The present value of costs
of investments (net of taxes and duties), operation, maintenance, and energy
of this solution has been compared with other solutions still open to con-
sideration using a discount rate of 11% which is estimated to be the opportu-
nity cost of capital in Ivory Coast. These alternatives are:
(i) carrying on the present policy of supplying the project area
by isolated diesels; and
(ii)  building a central diesel power station in each main town and
a medium voltage network to serve the whole area.
Technical characteristics and unit costs of investments are given in the
project file. Fuel oil has been valued at 43.0 CFAF/kg transport included
and net of local taxes and duties for central power stations, and 47.0 CFAF/kg
for isolated diesel stations.
4.12      For each spider network area, the cost of the isolated power sta-
tions is estimated to be at least 50% higher than the cost of interconnec-
tion, while the cost of supply from a central power station is higher than
the cost of interconnection by 10% to 30%. Sensitivity analyses on consump-
tion level, fuel oil price and discount rate do not change the conclusions.
1/   The long-run marginal cost is approximated by average incremental cost
of the generation and transmission program beyond 1985 (see Annex 8:
Overall Balance of Power and Energy).

Return on Investments
4.13      The internal economic rate of return (IERR) has been computed for
the total program over the 25 year design horizon. The IERR is the discount
rate which equalizes the present worth of all incremental costs net of taxes
and duties, and the present worth of associated incremental benefits. The
incremental costs are: (i) cost of new investments, (ii) associated running
costs, and (iii) cost of energy provided to the project area by the main
grid. The benefits include: (i) revenue from incremental sales of energy
evaluated at the average price paid at present by the ultimate consumers, used
as a minimum estimate of the willingness of consumers to pay for power,
(ii) savings in generating costs of the existing consumption, (iii) savings
in renewal investments since existing diesels would not be replaced, and
(iv) resale value of the existing diesel units. Details of the calculations
are given in the project file.
4.14      The IERR for each spider network and for the rural electrification
program as a whole has been computed in economic efficiency prices using a
standard conversion factor of 0.85 an oil price of US$24/bbl and are shown
below in Table 4.3.

4.15      The above-average IERR's for Ferkessedougou and Man result from the
sunk costs of transmission facilities (Man and Ferkessedougou will be reached
by the 220 kV grid in 1980 under EECI's current investment program) as well
as higher population densities and demand. Odienne benefits partially from
similar sunk costs since the 220 kV line which will feed Man will continue to
Laboa en route to Odienne. Odienne, Boundiali and Seguela are mostly rural
areas and are handicapped by lower density of population; hence, the rates of
return are below average. An increase in the fuel oil price would enhance
the IERR's. The rates of return would increase by about one percentage point
for each 20% increase in the cost of fuel.

Affordability of Electricity
4.16      A comparison of the available income information with the amount
of electricity that could be obtained by allocating 4% of household income
to electricity bills indicates that the specific domestic consumption assumed
for the spider network areas represent affordable purchases by rural house-
holds. The average family income 1/ in the Western Region is about 250,000
CFAF/year and is the lowest of the areas included in the rural electrification
program. The recent 20% increase in tariff level (para. 6.21) has raised the
average price for domestic use to about 36.9 CFAF/kWh. At this price, the
annual household consumption requiring 4% of income would be 270 kWh or over
double the specific domestic consumption assumed as the initial demand for
new customers to be connected in the rural areas. Since EECI provides house
connections free of charge during the first three years following elec-
trification (para. 6.08), the assumptions regarding the growth of house
connections (10-15% in the first year) are also reasonable.
V. THE IMPLEMENTATION AGENCY
5.01      The project would be executed by EECI, which would be the Borrower.
The Ivory Coast Government, would guarantee the loan.
5.02      EECI was established in 1952 as a "mixed economy" company - i.e.,
representing a combination of private enterprise and state participation.
Its objects were defined as all undertakings and operations concerning produc-
tion, transmission, distribution or utilization of electricity in the whole
of the Ivory Coast, taking over from the Public Works Department. Initially,
however, its activities were limited to the Abidjan area. The company also
operated some water systems as agent for the municipalities concerned, but
this activity ceased in 1976. As a private company, EECI is subject to the
normal civil and commercial code of law; as a public service undertaking, it
is also amenable in some respects to the administrative law ("droit public").
5.03      EECI is subject to the "tutelle" (guidance and supervision) of the
Ministry of Economy, Finance and Planning, which must approve tariffs and
investment programs; however, the company's accounts and budget are not
subject to formal approval. Like any other company, EECI is liable to taxes
and duties, including customs, VAT and income tax (except when specially
exempted, as for the proposed project). One such tax is an annual contribu-
tion to the Fonds National d'Investissement (FNI); however, this can be sub-
sequently recovered when an approved investment program is executed.
5.04      EECI's original share capital was CFAF 50 million, allotted to
numerous agencies, authorities, banks, companies and private individuals
in Ivory Coast, France and West Africa generally. This has grown over the
1/   Money income plus agricultural production for own consumption.



- 23 -
years to CFAF 2,800 million (1978), most of the additional capital having
been supplied by the State, which now holds approximately 79% of the total.
The remainder is held by French public agencies (16%) - Caisse Centrale de
Cooperation Economique (CCCE) and Electricite de France (EdF) - and some
private shareholders (5%). The Government's shares are vested in SONAFI
(Societe Nationale de Financement), a state holding company. Dividends at
the rate of 6% have been paid in most years.
"Concession" System
5.05      EECI operates under the "concession" system, widely used in French-
speaking countries and also occasionally found elsewhere. Under this system
(more fully described in Annex 10), the public utility company is granted a
license, for a fixed period of years, to take over, construct and operate
all facilities required, to levy agreed tariffs, and to recover its capital
at the end of the concession period. However, several major categories of
assets - usually hydro power installation, and the entire transmission and
distribution network, including substations and meters - are regarded as the
property of the State, and must be returned or made good by the company (even
if it has financed all or part of their cost) when its concession expires.
In view of this requirement, concession agreements prescribe a complex system
of depreciation and renewals appropriations which the company may recover
through its tariffs. The advantage claimed for the concept of concessions
is that it permits and encourages private enterprise to venture risk capital
into the field of public monopoly (the State not normally seeking to partici-
pate in either the capital or the profits) and operate on commercial lines,
whilst still ensuring a measure of State control and final ownership.
5.06      The concession agreements under which EECI operates are defective
in a number of respects, though the deficiencies quite clearly do not hamper
the company's operations or its de facto relationships with other entities
in any way. EECI's original concession was for the Abidjan-Bingerville area,
and should have been amended or repeated for each new expansion of the system.
However, such action was rarely taken, and EECI operates in all but a few of
the nearly 400 centers it serves without any formal authority. Similarly,
no concession agreement exists for the State-constructed Kossou dam (though
a financing convention was executed). Where agreements do exist, the con-
cessions are not always for uniform periods, varying from 40 to 75 years.
5.07      EECI has commissioned a French jurist to review the status of its
concession, in detail and in its general principle. Clearly the agreements
need to be put in order, even though the concession status might be con-
sidered largely academic in view of the State's majority shareholding. Both
EECI's management and the Government have agreed during negotiations that
deficiencies and anomalies in existing agreements will be rectified.
Management Organization and Operations
5.08      EECI's Board at present comprises 14 members, elected by the share-
holders. Ten represent SONAFI, two CCCE, and one the private shareholders,



- 24 -
plus the mayor of Abidjan as chairman. There is also a Government "Com-
missaire" who has the power to veto Board decisions. A Management Committee
functions between Board meetings and there is also a large measure of dele-
gation of powers to the General Manager.
5.09      EECI's General Manager is appointed by the Minister 1/ of "tutelle";
the present incumbent is a competent and dynamic Ivorian who has held office
for some 10 years and appears to enjoy a considerable measure of political
backing; in addition to the normal subordinate hierarchy, he is supported by
a panel of technical and professional advisers. Of the departmental directors
of EECI all are now Ivorians.
5.10      The organization chart of the company is shown in Annex 11, showing
the normal distribution on functions appropriate to a power company - New
Works, Generation and Transmission, Distribution, Finance, General Services,
Personnel and Training, with two further Directorates of Planning and Research
attached directly to the General Manager's office. For operations, the com-
pany is organized in eight Divisions, one each for Abidjan and each adminis-
trative region of Ivory Coast. Within the Divisions, there are subdivisions
called "Arrondissements", both rural and urban, each responsible for up to
3,000 consumers. EECI's facilities are operated quite satisfactorily. The
relatively good reliability of service, despite high annual growth rate of
consumption and the adverse effect of the Kossou dam (see para. 2.07), is
indicative of the rather efficient performance of the managerial and technical
staff (particularly in maintenance of the generation, transmission and dis-
tribution facilities).
Staffing
5.11      Staff are engaged and dismissed by company executives; management
imposed a hiring freeze in October 1978 to reverse what it saw as a tendency
towards over-generous staffing. The number of staff (1978) is 3,043 which
represents one employee for every 67 customers; this is not unreasonable for
Africa 2/ and is an improvement over ealier ratios (for example, 1 to 45 ten
years ago). Salaries, which are fixed by the Board, are slightly above
average public service levels as regards local personnel, and staff relations
are harmonious. Most vacancies are filled by promotion.
5.12      There are competent Ivorians in many executive positions; neverthe-
less, there are shortages in some technical and professional disciplines,
(e.g., accounting) and there is still heavy reliance on expatriates, almost
entirely French on secondment from EdF (EECI bearing the full cost). In 1968,

there were 43 expatriates out of 52 senior staff; now, there are 69 out of
218, so that while the absolute number has grown, the proportion has substan-
tially fallen. Nevertheless, EECI is conscious of the need to improve
the supply of qualified Ivorian personnel.
Training and Manpower Requirements
5.13      In 1971, the EECI established a residential training center (Centre
des metiers de l'electricite - CME) at Bingerville, 15 km outside Abidjan, to
provide full-time training programs for operating, administrative and super-
visory personnel and upgrading programs for employed workers at all levels.
The training center is fully residential and can accommodate for training 224
skilled workers and 64 staff at foreman or supervisory level. The CME pro-
vides (i) pre-employment training courses for skilled workers, varying in
duration from 12 to 18 months, in a full range of technical specialization;
(ii) technician-level programs varying in duration from 5 to 18 months, to
train foremen and work supervisors; (iii) upgrading programs (seminars and
short courses) for engineering staff and management-level personnel.  The CME
has a well-qualified instructional staff of about 80, well-equipped workshops
and laboratories, excellent academic and recreational facilities and full pro-
vision for staff and student accommodation. To increase the center's facil-
ities for training middle and upper-level personnel, additional accommodation
for about 64 students is being planned with financing under the proposed proj-
ect (para. 3.02).
5.14      Table 5 summarizes the 1977 staffing situation of the corporation,
by category of employment and percentage of Ivorianization, and provides a
long-term (1991) projection of manpower needs (based on a 1977 manpower
study) 1/:

The table indicates that the incremental staffing needs at the senior and
intermediate levels require an annual supply of about 30 university-level
staff (managers, engineers, economists, scientists) and about 70 middle-
level staff (technicians, foremen, supervisors), to be produced through re-
cruitment and training or through internal promotion. It would appear that
the CME has sufficient capacity to satisfy the training needs of skilled
workers and office staff but should increase its capacity for the training
and upgrading of middle- and upper-level staff. In addition, the provision
of scholarships for the training of engineers and scientists, especially
in technical specializations not available in the Ivory Coast, should be
increased. The proposed project provides for such scholarships (para. 3.02).
Accounting and Information Systems
5.15      EECI's accounting system is complex and sophisticated, and is fully
computerized, using an IBM 370 series computer. The structure of the accounts
follows the statutory "Plan Comptable Ivoirien", based on the system in use in
France; it covers cost accounting as well as financial accounting. Consumer
billing is carried out on the headquarters computer based on meter readings
transmitted by road or by mail. Bills are rendered bi-monthly for industrial
consumers. Individual consumer accounts are kept at district level, where
revenue collection is effected, the district records being reconciled monthly
with headquarters' control totals.
5.16      The budgeting and information systems, on the other hand, have until
recently been in need of improvement. Budgets were prepared on a rolling 5-
year basis in consultation with the responsible spending officers, but appro-
priations were structured on the financial accounts, instead of on the cost
accounts (where each "cost centers" can be made the undivided responsibility
of one person). Expenditure reports for control purposes were accordingly
too voluminous to be a practical management tool, and overspending was com-
mon. In consultation with the professional auditors, however, the costing
system has undergone a major overhaul, and the new system will produce much
more meaningful expenditure reports for budgetary control.
Audit and Insurance
5.17      Audits have hitherto been carried out by two "Commissaires aux
Comptes" (one professional accountant and one government commissioner),
appointed for three-year periods by the Board of EECI. This type of audit,
however, consists mainly of a review of, and commentary on, the figures dis-
closed in the published accounts, and does not usually include an in-depth
investigation of the detailed assets, liabilities, income or expenditure.
Beginning with the 1976/1977 accounts, EECI has also employed the firm of
Arthur Andersen to carry out a normal commercial audit and is now consider-
ing whether to dispense with the present "Commissaires aux Comptes." The
1976/1977 audit report disclosed no very serious criticisms (though it did
propose some corrections which, if made during the fiscal year, would have
converted EECI's marginal profit into a marginal loss). Agreement was reached
during negotiations that EECI will continue to have its annual accounts
audited by an independent auditor under terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank.



- 27 -
5.18      As of November 30, 1978, there was no internal audit section, though
a "Mission d'Inspection Comptable" carried out certain checks. On Bank
advice, EECI has established such a section.
5.19      EECI maintains comprehensive insurance cover against the normal
risks appropriate to an electricity undertaking.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Background
6.01      EECI operates under the "concession" system (para. 5.05 and
Annex 10), whereby most of the fixed assets in use are not considered to be
property of the Company but only "conceded" to it during the life of the
concession. However, unlike many concession companies, EECI does show all
assets in its balance sheet, regardless of legal ownership or by whom
financed. The company operates four types of amortization provision for
these assets:
(i) normal depreciation on its own assets (in the "private
domain");
(ii) normal depreciation on assets in the "public domain" financed
by the State or third parties (including consumer contributions
and the proceeds of a special Rural Electrification surcharge);
this depreciation does not, however, appear as part of the net
operating costs on which tariffs are based, being merely written
off the capital contributions account concerned in the balance
sheet;
(iii) amortization of investments financed by EECI in the public
domain - since such assets never become company property, the
amortization represents reimbursement of an advance, rather
than true depreciation; and
(iv) renewals provision on all assets in the public domain (since
the company has to surrender them in good condition on expiry
of the concession).
6.02      Provisions under (i) and (ii) are on a straight-line basis using
rather short lives for each type of asset; those under (iii) are at least
partly based on concession periods of up to 75 years (regardless of the
actual unexpired life of the concession at the time of investment). Renewals
provisions under (iv) are based on arbitrary lives, averaging about 2.4%. It
will be seen that this unusual pattern, plus the double charge for the same
assets under (iii) and (iv), renders it difficult to ascertain the true rate
of return achieved by EECI on net fixed assets in service; furthermore, EECI
does not revalue its assets to reflect inflation, since the appropriations
under (iii) should by definition be based on the original investment by the
company.

Past Financial Performance
6.03      For many years, EECI made regular small operating surpluses, but
with rising fuel costs, low productivity of the Kossou hydro scheme and
increasing investment in rural areas, profitability declined, and in 1973
the company made a net loss of CFAF 221 million (about US$1 million). Tariff
increases restored the position somewhat, but from May 1976 to November 1979
tariffs were frozen; in 1976/1977, despite an oil price rebate from the
Government, EECI just about broke even; the 1977/1978 accounts were in
substantial deficit of CFAF 2,175 million (US$10.4 million), and the 1978/79
accounts, while not yet being closed, are expected to show an even larger
deficit. However, as part of the measures taken by the Government, effective
November 1, 1979, including a tariff increase of 20%, EECI will be compensated
for its 1977/78 and 1978/79 deficits by an exceptional share capital contribu-
tion amounting to the same total. EECI's recent Income Statements appear in
Annex 12 and are summarized below:

Tariffs
6.04      From 1952 to 1964, EECI had several tariffs, based on the cost of
supply on each area. During the period, average rates fell by approximately
half, reflecting economies of scale. In 1964, new uniform tariffs for the
whole country were introduced; these represented a further average drop of 5%,
but in 1969 a surcharge was imposed to finance rural electrification (see
paras. 6.06 and 6.07). The surcharge produced about CFAF 4-500 million
annually in recent years - rather less than was spent under this head so that
the "fund" is in deficit to the extent of CFAF 761 million (end of 1977/1978).
In 1971, an index formula was approved, based on wholesale prices in France,
local wage levels, and fuel costs; though this enhanced rates by 5% in that
year, by 1973 average rates had risen only marginally since 1964.



- 29 -
6.05      In 1972, a comprehensive tariff study was completed, resulting
the following year in a new declining-block structure, based on long-term
marginal cost, with an average rate increase of 7%. Fuel cost increases
produced successive rate rises of 30%, 18% and 9.4% over the next three years;
in 1976 a further rise of 8% would have been due under the index formula, but
to avoid this the Government granted a compensatory fuel rebate (para. 6.10).
On November 1, 1979 EECI was allowed to raise its tariff by 20% and, starting
November 1979, the index formula already used in the past (para 6.04) will be
used again, EECI being allowed to raise its tariffs, without formal approval
by the Council of Ministers, each time the computed index will have increased
by at least 2%.
6.06      EECI's present tariff (shown in detail in Annex 3) would produce an
estimated average charge of CFAF 28.2/kWh or US413.4/kWh compared with
CFAF 18.4 in 1955 and CFAF 12.1 in 1970. The estimated averages for the
various consumer categories are:
Table 6.2
CFAF/kWh    US4/kWh
Low Voltage (Residential and Commercial)             36.9         17.6
Medium Voltage (Industrial)                          23.3         11.1
High Voltage (Large Industries, such as
Textiles)                                          11.9          5.7
For low-voltage domestic consumers, there are three charge blocks, the size
of each depending on each consumer's power demand; the first block is assumed
to cover approximate peak hour consumption, and the second and third, at
reduced rates, represent off-peak consumption. The charges for the three
blocks are roughly in the proportions 2.0-1.5-1.0. Commercial consumers have
a similar tariff structure, but about 8-15% higher than the domestic rates.
Both classes of consumers also pay a rural electrification surcharge of
CFAF 0.60/kWh and in some cases a small municipal tax. Special tariffs exist
for such uses as public lighting.
6.07      High and medium voltage consumers pay a two-part tariff:  a fixed
charge per kVA of power demand, and an energy charge varying according to
time of day; both unit-rates reducing as power demand rises. For these con-
sumers, the rural electrification surcharge is CFAF 75 per month/kVA. There
are penalties for very low power factor.
6.08      EECI subsidizes the cost of new connections to low-income consumers.
For a limited-current connection, EECI pays about 40% of the cost; in the
first three years of a new scheme, however, EECI bears the entire cost to



- 30 -
encourage connection to the system. There is also an implicit cross-subsidy
from urban consumers to rural consumers (over and above the rural electrifi-
cation surcharge) since both pay the same rate, though costs are inevitably
higher for the latter.  On the other hand, the declining block rate, tends to
favor large consumers and discourage energy conservation. Furthermore, when
the existing tariff structure was designed the 1973 oil price increases were
not foreseen, nor was the mix of thermal and hydro generation foreseen to be
as it is; the Kossou reservoir was supposed to be filled by 1980 and generate
500 GWh/year of hydropower, whereas it is not now expected to generate more
than 100 GWh/year until the late 1980's. On the other hand, the Government
had not then decided to launch its present expanded program of hydroelectric
investment. For these reasons, a tariff study should be conducted as soon as
possible to identify necessary corrective measures for both tariff levels and
tariff structures. Terms of reference for such a study were discussed and
agreed upon during appraisal (see para. 3.09; Terms of reference in Project
File). Agreement was reached during negotiations that the study will be
completed by May 31, 1980 and its recommendations subsequently discussed with
Bank before implementation.
Financial Details
6.09      Revenue collection is effective, accounts receivable representing
about 3 months' revenues - since most billings are bi-monthly, this is a
reasonable level. A problem arose in 1977 with a new system of payment of
Government bills, and receivables under that head rose by two-thirds; how-
ever, measures have been taken to remedy this and by the end of 1978, arrears
had fallen below the 1976 level.
6.10      The revenues shown in para. 6.03 include a rebate, or subsidy,
reimbursed by the Government from 1976 to compensate for the latest oil price
increase and avoid a tariff increase. The amounts credited to date were
CFAF 1,153 million in 1976/1977 and CFAF 1,425 in 1977/1978 (about 18% of
fuel costs). Domestic oil prices are regulated by a Price Commission and
EECI considers that, even with the subsidy, it is paying too much for a
refinery by-product of which it is almost the only consumer. Nevertheless,
operating subsidies are undesirable and in line with the Bank's recommendation
the Government will phase out this one by 1980.
6.11      EECI's Income Statements show that operating costs before depre-
ciation/renewals provision represented about CFAF 21 per kWh sold in 1977/
1978, compared with only about CFAF 12 in 1975 - a rise of over 70% - whereas
average revenues increased by only about 13%. Despite substantial salary
increases in 1977, personnel expenses remained steady at 26-28% of total
operating costs, whereas fuel costs rose from 19% in 1975 to 28% in 1977/1978;
not only this reflects increased world oil prices, but also failure of the
Kossou scheme to meet increased energy demands which has forced EECI back to
costly thermal generation.
6.12      Depreciation and renewal provisions represent a major element in
EECI's operating costs (about one-quarter of the total on average). These
substantial appropriations, however, ensure a certain measure of internal cash



- 31 -
generation; in 1977/1978 for example, despite the severe operating loss and
the doubling of capital expenditure over the previous year, EECI still
financed some 19% of those investments from internal sources; about 21% was
contributed by other parties (consumers, municipalities, etc.) and of the
remainder about half came from long-term loans and half from Bank overdrafts.
In the previous three years, internal cash generation amounted to over 28% of
capital expenditure. EECI's recent cash flow statements appear in Annex 13
and are summarized below:

6.13      Despite internal cash generation and external contributions,
borrowings have been substantial; long-term debt has almost quadrupled since
1972, and Bank overdrafts and temporary loans have mushroomed to CFAF 6.5
billion (US$30 million approximately) as of September 30, 1978. Foreign
lenders have included an Italian consortium, French CCCE, CIDA and the European
Investment Bank; local lenders comprise Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA) -
a Government agency - and various Ivorian and West African Banks, sometimes on-
lending foreign loans. The biggest loan to date was for part of the cost of
the Kossou dam; by a special apportionment made by Government, EECI assumed
from CAA the foreign loans portion of the cost, with the Government providing
the local budget appropriation, which was transferred to EECI as a capital
contribution (in view of Kossou's multiple uses). Onlending terms were based
on what the equivalent thermal generation would have cost at that time, rather
than on the exact terms of the foreign loans. Though EECI has had other
credits on concessionary terms (e.g. from CIDA), much of its debt has been
repayable over short periods (6-12 years) and the average interest rate has
risen to about 7.5%. On the other hand, the burden of some foreign loans has
been alleviated by favorable exchange rate movements.

6.15      On the conventional basis, the debt-equity ratio is about 57:43
at the end of 1977/1978; on the strict "concession" basis, however, with
consumer and Government contributions excluded from equity, together with
the Renewals Fund balance (on the grounds that these represent assets which
do not belong to the company), loan debt bears the proportion of 92:8 to the
small amount of the shareholders' own equity and reserves. This imbalance is
likely to be accentuated with the projected assumption of the debt on two new
dams which the Government will transfer to EECI 1/. Loan debt thus incurred
by EECI on the "public domain" has to be repaid over the term fixed by the
lender, but the amortization provisions for the asset concerned, which help to
provide cash for such repayments, are calculated over much longer periods (see
para. 6.02).
6.16      In summary, therefore, EECI while basically a healthy company,
has fallen into difficulties. It is, and has been for sometime, technically
insolvent in that its current liabilities exceed its current assets, and it
bears some of the classical signs of "over-trading" on too small a capital
base (high accounts payable, Bank overdrafts, etc.). The measures taken on
November 1, 1979 (see paras 6.03 and 6.05) eliminate present operating losses;
however, complementary measures, such as further tariff increases or a sub-
stantial increase of equity capital will be required to reverse the decline in
profitability.
Future Financial Performance
6.17      To define a satisfactory program for EECI's financial rehabilitation
entails proposing specific performance targets to be achieved within a reason-
able time.  The conventional criterion would be a rate of return on revalued
net fixed assets, but this does not appear to be wholly appropriate in EECI's
case. To begin with, EECI's assets are at historic cost and to revalue them
for balance sheet purposes conflicts with some aspects of the concession
agreements. Again, not all depreciation appears as an operating expense
(para. 6.01(ii)) and the rates of depreciation applied are arbitrary, not
always reflecting anticipated asset life; these effects, further distorted
by the additional provision of renewals contributions on many assets, render
any expressed rate of return somewhat unmeaningful. Another practical diffi-
culty would arise from the lumpy pattern of EECI's fixed assets accretions -
between now and 1985, three dams (Taabo, Buyo and Soubre) are expected to be
handed over by Government agencies, together with the related debt, so that
net fixed assets in operation can double in value in one year. EECI's
rate base is in fact expected to grow to nearly six times its present value
in seven years, so that any reasonable rate of return target would be diffi-
cult to program.
1/   The same assumption applies also to the Soubre hydroplant which would
be on line in the 1980's.



- 34 -
6.18      Instead, a cash generation covenant is proposed - a concept which
in fact underlies the more usual rate of return covenant. EECI's cash gener-
ation contribution would be measured as: (a) its operating surplus before
charging depreciation and renewals/repairs contributions, but after charging
taxes, FNI contributions, and interest, as well as dividends (or other cash
distributions) paid out during the year in question; plus (b) recoveries of
FNI contributions, together with consumer deposits and the proceeds of the
Rural Electrification surcharge, both of which are "generated" by the billing
system; less (c) debt repayment, expenditure from the repairs fund, and any
increase in working capital other than cash (i.e., debtors and inventory, less
creditors). The resulting contribution can be expressed each year as a per-
centage of capital expenditure for that year, to measure EECI's growing
reliance on its own resources for financing capital programs, rather than
resorting to borrowing.
6.19      The "lumpiness" mentioned above creates a similar problem in a cash
generation covenant, since the Government-constructed dams appear in EECI's
records only on handover (for the full cost), instead of figuring in EECI's
expenditure year by year during construction. However, this can be resolved
by treating the estimated final cost of each dam (as revised from time to
time during construction, including capitalized interest) as if incurred by
equal annual installments over the four years ending with the year of hand-
over. Capital expenditure would therefore comprise EECI's own expenditure
including deferred charges ("frais d'etablissement"), together with expendi-
ture charges to the Renewals Fund, and the annual installment thus calculated
in respect of dams planned or under construction. The series of annual totals
so arrived at would be further smoothed by taking a 3-year moving average,
covering the year of calculation, the previous year and the following year's
forecast.
6.20      On this basis, it is considered that net cash generation of 25% of
capital expenditures would be a reasonable target to attain, by 1982/1983. To
achieve this would require that in addition to the last 20% tariff increase
that took place on November 1, 1979, further tariff increases would be imple-
mented each year so that EECI could fully compensate for inflation. If EECI
was limited to the strict application of the index formula negotiated with the
Government, achievement of the cash generation target would imply that, on the
basis of the projections as shown in Annex 14, the company would have to
increase its productivity by an additional 2% per year, which is reasonable to
expect. After 1982/1983 cash generation of more than 25% appears to be
assured (on present projections) though the level of capital expenditure in
the subsequent years cannot be precisely estimated now. Annexes 12 through 14
contain projections of income statements, cash flow and balance sheets through
1986/1987, and Annex 15 contains calculations of the net cash generation
percentages forecast to be achieved. Assumptions for the projections are in
Annex 16.
6.21      During negotiations, agreement was reached with EECI that it will
take all measures required to reach the 25% cash generation target in 1982/1983
and thereafter, calculated as outlined above.



- 35 -
6.22      It is implicit in the financial projections, that the power-
generation related costs of the dam at Taabo would be transferred by the
Government to EECI free of loan debt, by way of equivalent additional share
capital (as distinct from a simple free gift in kind, or "remise gratuite",
which has different accounting consequence). The rationale for this assump-
tion is the following: first, the existing Kossou dam, in respect of which
EECI had to bear about two-thirds of the cost and of the related debt, has
produced very little energy because of a severe drought (para. 2.07); there-
fore, Taabo could be considered as merely making up for a previous unremun-
erative investment decided and implemented by Government and subsequently
transfered to EECI for operation. Secondly, if Taabo were added to EECI's
debt burden so early in the time-frame, tariff increases of about 20% higher
than those resulting from the application of the indexation formula would be
necessary to achieve the cash generation objective. Finally, this alternative
would improve EECI's debt-equity ratio (para. 6.15) and bring the company's
share capital more into line with assets employed. As the Government is still
considering the alternative ways of safeguarding EECI's financial viability,
agreement was reached during negotiations that the Government will enable EECI
to respect its obligations under the Loan Agreement (which include the 25%
cash generation target by 1982/83; para 6.21).
6.23      Even though no rate of return convenant is proposed, EECI should
at least have some idea of the true rate of return which it is earning on
capital employed, as a monitoring and management tool. Accordingly, assur-
ances were obtained during negotiations that EECI will (i) set up, by 1980/81
a system of pro-forma records to estimate the current values of its net fixed
assets year by year, using conventional depreciation rates as practiced in the
electricity supply industry, (ii) calculate the notional rate of return
achieved each year on that basis (i.e., substituting the conventional de-
preciation charges for the provisions actually made in the accounts); and
(iii) inform the Bank of the result of this exercise within six months of the
end of each fiscal year following the agreed date.
6.24      Projections made on the assumptions outlined in this report show
that EECI would recover its financial stability at an increasing rate. Its
net annual earnings, at present negative, would increase to about one-fifth
of annual revenues, and increased cash balances would begin to emerge - though
such balances would in practice probably be needed to finance presently
unplanned capital expenditure in the ensuing years. Debt service coverage and
debt-equity ratio would both be satisfactory; nevertheless as a precaution,
agreement was reached during negotiations that EECI will not incur debt unless
its future debt service coverage is greater than 1.5 times, on the conventional
basis and that existing short-term debt (see para. 6.13) will be limited by
September 30, 1981 to not more than 5% of its operating revenue. Although
rates of return on revalued assets cannot be forecast at this time, it is
noted that in spite of the tariff increases projected, the financial rate
of return on historically valued assets would only be 6.5% in 1982/83.
However, it would be 12.5% at the end the studied period. The following
table shows some salient features of EECI-s future finances, as projected:

VII. SUMMARY, AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The Ivorian Government's high priorities in the power sector are:
(i) improvement of nationwide electricity coverage by extending
supplies to rural areas; and
(ii)  reduction in both of the country-s dependence on expensive
imported oil and of electricity supply costs in remote rural
areas.
The proposed project would aim at contributing to the fulfillment of these
priorities, furthermore, it would help rationalize the power sector develop-
ment through the implementation of studies for a nationwide rural electrifi-
cation planning, an urban distribution systems development and the preparation
of the next project for hydro-generation; the proposed project would also
help regularize the "concession" system under which EECI operates. A special
emphasis would be given to the strengthening of EECI s operating capability
through training and its financial position so that EECI may better fulfill
its role as the national agency responsible for electricity supply.
Project Risks
7.02      No special risks are foreseen in the implementation of the project;
project management being provided by consultants. No difficulties are fore-
seen in achieving annually the volume of work indicated in the construction
schedule or in reaching the number of customers estimated since financial
assistance to new customers is planned, in accordance with present practices.
Additional assurances of successful project implementation would be achieved
by obtaining agreement from the Government and EECI on the conditions set
forth in para. 7.03.
7.03      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government
and EECI that:
(i) EECI will have the dams at each of the power sites inspected
annually by qualified experts (para. 3.12);
(ii)  EECI's concession agreements will be updated, modernized and
extended to the whole territory of the Ivory Coast (para 5.07);
(iii) EECI will have its annual accounts audited by an independent
auditor under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank
(para. 5.17);



- 39 -
(iv)  a tariff study will be carried out by a consultant, completed
by May 31, 1980 and its recommendations discussed with the
Bank before implementation (para. 6.08);
(v) EECI will achieve internal cash generation of 25% of capital
expenditure in 1982/1983 and thereafter (para. 6.21);
(vi)  EECI will not incur debt without consulting the Bank unless
its cash generation is at least 1.5 times future debt service,
including the proposed borrowing and will limit its
short-term debt by September 30, 1981 to not more than 5%
of its operating revenues (para 6.24).
7.04      On the basis of the above agreements, the project is suitable for a
loan of US$33 million, repayable over 17 years including 4 years grace.

FIRST POWER PROJECT
PROJECT MONITORING GUIDELINES
General
1.        EECI's 1981-1984 Rural Electrification Program is the first in
Ivory Coast to be planned for such a large geographical area. It is essen-
tial that a monitoring system be developed to gather extensive data during
the execution of the porgram in order that the experience gained could be
used in EECI's subsequent programs. The following guidelines have been
prepared to serve as the basis for discussions in the development of an
appropriate monitoring system by EECI's and its consultants.
2.        It would seem desirable that the data system be designed to collect
the information (load and costs data) on a geographical data basis using the
power system configuration, i.e., for each village, then for the group of
villages on the same medium voltage feeder, then for 90 kV/medium voltage
substations and each "spider network". Data collection could be developed
to allow comparison with sales, development of average supply costs, etc.
The monitoring system could also be designed for computer use in view of the
volume of detailed data and the desirabilty of processing it for various
purposes.
Operational Data
3.        The following data could be collected by village:
(i) the growth in number of consumers, demand (kW and kWh) and
revenue per consumer (including, if possible, statistical
analysis of individual consumer growth), consumers being
classified as Residential (with separate number for low-
income subsidized connections in each spider network),
Commercial, Government and Municipal, Public Lighting,
Industrial, Irrigation; the growth of village demand
sales and revenues (evolution of load factor per village,
feeder, substation and spider network);
(ii) the use of electricity by each category of consumer with
information on types, and number of appliances;
(iii) taxes paid by consumers as part of the electricity bills;
(iv) types and number of dwellings per village and per spider
network;



ANNEX 7
Page 2
(v) trends in socio-economic factors (population growth,
migration flow, household average incomes, average number
of people per dwelling/consumers, etc.);
(vi) information on the village evolution (existing roads, water
supply, schools, health centers, agricultural, commercial
and industrial activities, and evolution with electrification
development);
(vii) number of power failures (at each level from consumer to
90/33 kV substations) duration and causes of failures
with special focus on single wire with earth return
feeders;
(viii) results of annual measurements on single wire with earth
return systems of level of ground resistances which should
not exceed 5 ohms at the time of installation; and
(ix) records of any unusual events on the single wire with earth
return systems.
Cost Data
4.        The costing system could be developed by collecting the following
data:
(i) statistical information on transformers, feeder lengths,
and capacities;
(ii) capital costs concerning 90 kV/medium voltage substations,
transmission, subtransmission low voltage lines, transformers,
consumers connections, etc.; and
(iii) operating and maintenance costs by village, medium voltage
feeder (with focus on single wire with earth return lines)
substation, spider network.
Critical Targets for Project Implementation
5.        Actual implementation progress would be compared with planned
targets. Some important target dates are indicated below for construction
of the spider network of Man:
-    Completion of design and tender documents by Aug. 31, 1980
-    Advertising for bids by Sept. 30, 1980
-    Bid opening analysis by Dec. 31, 1980
-    Award of contracts by April 30, 1981

6.         Concerning the project training component, EECI would prepare by
July 30, 1980 a detailed plan indicating specialties, schedules and countries
of training for the candidates as well as method of selection of candidates;
this plan would be discussed with Bank before implementation.
Reporting Requirements
7.        A quarterly progress report would be required within 60 days of the
end of each calender quarter providing:
(i) detailed information and comments on project execution
(procurement problems; existing/potential delays - and
causes - compared to original construction schedule;
project costs broken down between local and foreign costs;
existing/potential project cost overruns and action
envisioned; disbursement schedule); and on any events,
affecting - or which could significantly affect - the
project execution with action recommended to safeguard
the project;
(ii) information related to the monitoring system which would
be developed on the basis of guidelines described above
in paras. 3 to 6; and
(iii) information concerning EECI's finances which would be
reported annually within six months of the end of each
EECI fiscal year.
8.         The annual financial report would comprise EECI's normal financial
statements (income and balance sheet statements) plus:
(i) a fund flow statement showing separately, inter alia,
investments related to EECI's 1981/84 rural electrification
program and to other major investments;

Page 4
(ii) a statement of actual total sales by consumer category
compared to forecasts; and
(iii) a statement on receivables broken down by major consumers.
9.        Furthermore EECI would:
(i)  set up a system of pro-forma records to estimate the current
values of its net fixed assets year by year, using conventional
depreciation rates as practiced in the electricity supply
industry;
(ii) calculate the notional rate of return achieved each year
on that basis; and
(iii) report the result of each fiscal year (starting with fiscal
year 1979-80) in the annual financial report mentioned in
paras. 7 and 8.

ENERGIE ELECTRIQUE DE LA COTE D'IVOIRE (EECI)
FIRST POWER PROJECT
THE "CONCESSION" SYSTEM IN PUBLIC UTILITIES
A.   Background and General Principles
1.        The French system of concessions in the field of public utilities
originated in 1906 and was widely applied in France and its colonies. Similar,
but not identical, arrangements have also operated in other countries (e.g.
Portugal and Brazil). The system was formulated when the development of
electricity distribution by private companies began to encroach on the public
domain, in the form of transmission lines and equipment erected on public
lands (e.g., streets and highways); for which only temporary wayleaves could
be granted under existing French law.
2.        The aims of the concession concept were to permit and encourage
private investment in the development of electricity supply systems, with
guaranteed monopoly rights to operate those systems for an agreed term of
years, to levy reasonable rates, and to recover capital, whilst still securing
for the State the ownership of national resources (such as hydroelectric power
facilities) and works built on public property for the purpose of electricity
distribution. Over the years, numerous variants were evolved in the applica-
tion of these basic principles, but typically the arrangements entered into
would follow the pattern described below.
3.        The public utility company concerned (the "concessionaire") exe-
cutes an agreement, usually for a period of between 50 and 90 years, with the
responsible department of the government (the "autorite concedante"). This
agreement, or "convention de concession", with its attached schedule of spe-
cifications ("cahier des charges") would give the concessionaire the rights,
inter alia, to:
(i) use public property to distribute electricity;
(ii) take over existing generation and distribution facilities;
(iii) expropriate land in certain circumstances;
(iv) regulate wiring systems of private consumers;
(v) impose tariffs as specified, with the possibility of
revising these in accordance with a cost-index formula;
and
(vi) recover its capital at the end of the concession; the State
would not normally participate in either the share capital
or the profits of the company.



ANNEX 10

4.        In return, the company accepts certain obligations, such as the
duty to:
(i) operate any works handed over, together with any subsequent
additions similarly classified as State property, maintain
them in good condition, and hand them back on the expiry
of the concession, even when they have been financed by the
company (see (iii) below);
(ii) supply all consumers who can be connected to the system; and
(iii) construct at its own expense, not only works considered
to be company property (such as administrative buildings,
vehicles and some types of generating plant) but also any
subsequent upgrading of the State-owned distribution system,
and even, in some cases, extensions thereto, including con-
sumer meters; though extensions would normally be the
responsibility of the State.
5.        On expiry of the concession (failing its renewal for a further
period), the concessionaire is required to return or make good to the State
the assets considered to be public property, together with any other assets
to be transferred by mutual agreement; and a settlement of accounts takes
place in accordance with the original contract. Provision is also made for
premature termination, with appropriate compensation for loss of profit.
6.        The benefits of the concession system are said to be that it
enables private enterprise to venture risk capital into the field of public
monopoly, to develop and expand a public service, and to operate it commer-
cially and efficiently; while at the same time retaining a necessary measure
of state ownership and control, and indeed with provision for the state to
harvest the final fruits of the investment. Nevertheless, the system some-
times gave rise to difficulty in former colonial territories when newly inde-
pendent governments resented the privileges of expatriate concessionaires.
It has also been criticized for allowing companies to amass large cash
balances by reason of generous depreciation allowances, without ever showing
more than minimal profits. Whether the system is outdated in the modern con-
text is a matter of opinion.
B.   Accounting Features of the Concession System
7.        Understandably, the division of property and responsibility outlined
above entails accounting practices which can be complex, confusing and time-
consuming.
8.        All capital assets employed in the undertaking are classified in
two main categories:



ANNEX 10
Page 3
(i) the "private domain" ("domain prive") belonging to the company
and usually comprising thermal power stations constructed by
the company, industrial and administrative buildings, housing,
vehicles and plant; and
(ii) the "public domain" ("domaine concede") comprising distri-
bution and transmission networks and substations, hydro-
power stations, reservoirs and dams, existing generating
plant, public lands, and consumer meters and connections.
9.        Assets in the public domain are not the property of the utility
(even where that entity has contributed all or part of the cost) and accord-
ingly do not normally appear in the balance sheet, except to the extent of
any such contribution. Even then, the amounts in question are classified
separately as "intangible assets". Thus, the company's balance sheet may
not present a complete picture of the capital assets in service, though it
does reflect the company's investment herein.
10.       In consequence of these distinctions, three types of amortization
provision are practiced by the concessionaire (and allowed for in its tariffs):
(i) Normal depreciation ("amortissement industriel") is
calculated for assets in the private domain;
(ii) Depreciation is not chargeable on assets in the public
domain since they do not normally figure in the balance
sheet (but see (iii) below); however, an annual renewal
provision ("provision de renouvellement") is set aside,
to enable the concessionaire to fulfill his obligation
to surrender those assets intact at the end of the con-
cession; the rates used for this provision are fixed
in the "cahier des charges" and are usually based on
the life-span of each type of asset;and
(iii) Where, however, assets in the public domain have been
wholly or partly financed by the concessionaire, the
equivalent of depreciation may be charged on such
investments. This provision ("amortissement de caducite")
which is usually calculated by reference to the remaining
life of the concession, represents reimbursement to the
company of amounts advanced by it to the public domain,
rather than true depreciation. For this reason, revalua-
ticn of such assets (e.g. for inflation) is not usually
practiced.
11.       It will be seen that under (ii) and (iii) above, there can be a
double burden on revenues in respect of the same investment. On the other
hand, it may  e argued that this does no more than help compensate for infla-
tion, or alternatively permits the undertaking to improve its rate of internal
cash generation within the permitted tariffs -- i.e., it ensures an enhanced
cash flow for future expansion of the system, without creating distributable
profits.

C.   The Concession System as Applied to EECI
12.       The Concession arrangements which operate in EECI's case differ
from the standard pattern outlined above, in the following respects:
(i) The Government is a major shareholder in EECI, holding
about four-fifths of the issued capital and a corresponding
share of seats on the Board;
(ii) EECI's concession agreements are by no means complete or
comprehensive; the original contract covered only the
Abidjan area and amendments to add new areas as the system
expanded have been executed for only a handful of such
extensions. Moreover, the concession periods differ for
different systems, and no proper concession at all exists
for the major Kossou dam. As indicated in the main report,
steps are being taken to remedy these deficiencies;
(iii) Tariffs have reflected several different concepts over the
years, and EECI needs Government approval for any increase;
and
(iv) EECI has contributed a substantial proportion (about
two-thirds) of the cost of investments in the "domaine
concede".
13.       Some of the more inconvenient aspects of concession accounting have
been eliminated from EECI's accounts. All assets are included in the balance
sheet, including these in the "domaine concede" which have been provided by
the State or other outside contributors (e.g. consumers); such "non-company"
assets are counter-balanced by contribution accounts on the other side of the
balance sheet, in a manner comparable with normal public utility practice.
Thus, the balance sheet gives a complete picture of investments in the system,
no matter by whom made.
14.       Correspondingly, depreciation is written off all fixed assets,
including those so contributed; if the contribution was in cash, the depre-
ciation charged appears as an expense in the Income Statement, but simul-
taneously that account is also credited with a slightly larger amount, which
is used to write down the contributions account concerned, thus reducing this
in step with the corresponding asset value. (The difference between debit and
credit stems from the fact that consumer contributions include an oncost, over
and above the basic fixed asset value.) In the case of assets contributed in
kind, no such difference arises and the amount written off the asset is also
written directly off the contribution account, without passing through the
Income Statement. In either case, concession principles are respected inas-
much as net operating costs, and hence tariffs, are not inflated by depreci-
ation which is not the liability of the company.

1/ The R.E. surcharge nowhere appears as a revenue in EECI's accounts; the amounts levied are posted to a creditors' account under the heading "Due to Public Authorities", until applied to finance expenditure, when they
are transferred direct to equity in the Balance Sheet ("Contributions from Third Parties etc.").  In the normal cash flow statement based on balance sheet movements, this surcharge is therefore not identifiable as a
source of internal cash generation, though it is in reality little different from EECI's other sales revenues.  Projected as 2.2% of revenues calculated on present tariffs.
2/ Notional figure in absence of more precise information about subsequent capital programs (e.g. dams to be constructed after 1985).

FIRST POWER PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
A.   Income Statements
Sales (other than HT) are projected to grow at annual rates between
9% and 11%, with a slightly faster increase in the project area. Average
rates (before any projected tariff increase) are assumed to taper off slightly
as sales per consumer expand into the cheaper consumption blocks. Unbilled
consumption at year end is calculated at 1.13% of MT sales, and 7.75% of LT
sales (which are billed less frequently). HT sales and tariffs are based on
specific assumptions of industrial consumption. Tariff increases assumed are
as forecast in the main Report.
Other revenues are projected as a function of the growth of sales
and consumers, and of the inflation index (see below). Bad Debts Provision
is calculated at 1-1/8% on sales.
As regards expenditure, Personnel Expenses are assumed to grow at
5% a year, plus the factor for inflation. Fuel purchases are computed on the
forecast thermal generation needs year by year. Heavy oil-fuel is priced at
CFAF 26,300/ton, plus inflation. Other supplies and other expense headings
are in general projected in proportion to such parameters as numbers of con-
sumers and staff, sales, etc. Renewals Fund and Depreciation Provisions are
based on forecasts for expenditure on each class of fixed asset, using the
following rates:
Annual %
Depreciation - Private Domain                      8.9
Depreciation - Public Domain:
EECI Financed - Dams             1.33
EECI Financed - Other            7.3
*Third Party - Dams               1.33
*Third Party - Other             12.0
Depreciation - Deferred Charges                  100.0
Renewals Provision - Public Domain                 2.2
(* These items are not a charge to the Income Statement.)

Page 2
Expenses transferred to Capital Account are projected on the basis
of 25% of "Other Supplies" and 5% of capital expenditure. Income Tax is
assumed at an effective rate of 17.5% of profits and FNI Contributions at
10% of profits, plus a real estate tax. Distributions are assumed at 6% on
capital, plus an annual donation of CFAF 30 million to the Staff Welfare
Fund, both disbursed the following year for cash flow projections.
Inflation coefficients applied are:
Foreign       Local
1979                        12%            11%
1980                        10.5%          10%
1981                         9%             9%
1982                         8%             8%
Thereafter                      7%             7%
For fuel, the foreign coefficients are used; for other expenses and revenues,
the local rates, except for "Other Supplies" where a combination of the two
Is applied. For capital expenditure outside the project, different rates are
used: 10% for 1978/79 and 1979/80, 8% to 1984/85, then 7%.
B.   Cash Flow Statements and Balance Sheets
Consumer Deposits are assumed to be a function of revenue per con-
sumer and the growth in the number of consumers each year. Accounts Payable
are calculated at 30% of cash operating expenses plus 15% of capital expendi-
ture, while Accounts Receivable are based on 3 months' sales revenues, for
consumer arrears, plus 7-1/2% on sales, 15% of personnel expenses, and the
value of unbilled energy, for other receivables.  Stocks are computed in
proportion to fuel consumption and the value of "Other Supplies" each year.
For other sources of funds, Additional Share Capital is as projected
by EECI, plus the value of the Taabo dam, in respect of which an equivalent
F"im is assumed to be contributed to EECI's share capital. It has been supposed
that the compensation decided by the Government to make up for FY 1978 and FY
1979 deficits would be made in the form of a share capital contribution in
cash. New loans are as already projected by EECI, together with further
borrowings to eliminate overdrafts and cover cash needs, as well as the cost
of the two 72ams being or to be constructed; and the loans for the project,
which are c-sumaned to be as follows:
TB RD   -MCFA  6,93u 0iiil i;n at 8.25% for 17 years including 4 years'
grace.
Canada  - CFAF 5,990 millicnt at 0% for 50 years including 10 years'
grace, plus CFAF 3,890 million at 9.5% for 13 years including
5 years' grace.



- 71 -                         ANNEX 16
Page 3
Germany - CFAF 5,880 million at 0.75% for 50 years including 10 years'
grace, plus CFAF 3,900 million at 8.5% for 13 years including
3 years' grace.
Assets contributed are based on that portion of the forecast capital
expenditure to be financed by consumers, Rural Electrification surcharge
and municipalities. (The dam contributed as share capital would not be so
classified, being technically "purchased" by EECI with the share capital so
contributed.)
Capital Expenditure outside the project is based on EECI's projec-
tions; expenditure from the Renewals Fund is shown as round-sum estimates in
the absence of any firm basis for accurate projections, while expenditure from
the Repairs Fund is assumed to be exactly equal to the previous year's con-
tribution to the Fund. FNI Recoveries are likewise protected as round sums,
based on prior contributions to that fund by EECI.
