1. SECTOR BACKGROUND AND ISSUES
A. BACKGROUND
1.1   China has achieved well known gains in education. With an enrollment of 132
million pupils and 5.6 million teachers in about 668,700 primary schools, China runs the
largest primary school system in the world. At the junior secondary level there are
67,000 schools with an enrollment of 46.6 million pupils and 2.8 million teachers. In
1995, overall national net enrollment rates for the first nine years of schooling were 98.5
percent of the 6-11 age cohort enrolled in primary education, and more than 78.4 percent
of the 12-15 age cohort in junior secondary schools. Of primary graduates, 90.8 percent
went on to middle schools (regular or vocational). Almost 98.2 percent of all school-age
girls have been enrolled in primary education. A significant consequence of these high
enrollment figures is the high literacy rates: 80 percent for those above 15 years of age
and about 93 percent among those between 15 and 25 years of age. The projected figures
for 2000 are 135 million pupils at primary level and 55 million at junior secondary level.
1.2   Global figures, though indicative of substantial progress, tend to mask disparities
in basic education development, with noticeable imbalances in the availability of
educational services between the economically advanced and underdeveloped regions.
Generally, urban and coastal areas have achieved the goal of nine-year basic education,
but many poor, sparsely-populated and remote areas have not achieved the primary
education targets. Schooling in poor counties is marked by poor attendance and high
repetition and drop-out rates. Although net enrollment rates for primary school-age
children in several autonomous regions exceed the national average of 98.5, five
provinces-Gansu, Guizhou, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan-and three autonomous
regions-Ningxia, Tibet and Xinjiang-lag far behind. Regional disparities are even
more conspicuous in completion rates, i.e., the proportion of children entering first grade
who eventually graduate from primary school. While the national average for the
completion rate in 1991-92 was estimated at 91 percent, it ranged between 78.6 percent in
Jiangxi Province and 99.7 percent in Beijing.
1.3   Among the deprived sections of the population, minorities and girls and women
continue to be more disadvantaged. For example, a study of 25 minority counties shows
that the gross enrollment rate of school aged minority children was 20 percentage points
lower than the national mean, with female enrollment particularly low. Facilities for
basic education are equally available for both boys and girls, yet there is a significantly
lower level of utilization of facilities by girls. Almost half the rural population is literate
or semi-literate, the illiteracy rate for women being 70 percent. Enrollment rates for girls
in minority areas can reach 20 to 30 percent less than for boys. The number of female
teachers in rural minority areas tends to be about one third of that of male teachers.

B. SECTOR REFORM AGENDA
1.4   Educational development is a major instrument in China's drive for
modernization to the end of this century and the early stage of the 21st century.
Educational reforms and development, responsive to the changing human capital
demands of the growing economy, were encapsulated in a series of policy and legal
documents, such as "Decision to Reform the Educational Structure" (1985), "Compulsory
Education Law" (1986), "Outline for Reform and Development of Education" (1993),
and "Education Law" (1995). The current reforms relevant to basic education focus on
the following areas: (a) the provision of Nine Years' Compulsory Education for all
school-age children; (b) the development of vocational and technical education at the
secondary and postsecondary levels; (c) the strengthening of education management at all
levels by strengthening the role of principals and local authorities in the design of the
reforms, and transferring the responsibility for providing basic education to local
governments under the central government's policy guidance and financial support;
(d) the great increase of investment in basic education by the governments at all levels;
(e) the continuous improvement and gradual standardization of school operational
conditions; (f) the enhancement of teachers quality by further strengthening of teachers'
education and training. The State Education Commission (SEdC), created in June 1986
as- the successor to the Ministry of Education (MOE) and responsible nationally for
policy, budgeting and coordination of this sector, therefore has the mission of overseeing
the above reforms at the national level.
C. MAJOR ISSUES AND CONSTRAINTS
1.5   The goal of universalization of basic education in poor counties has to contend
with a number of key sector issues and constraints, many of which are due to the diversity
of conditions in different parts of China. Rural poverty exacerbates such conditions.
Further, the reforms call for a number of administrative changes for which local
management capacity will have to be developed. Weak educational outcomes signal low
returns to investment and a failure to capture the significant benefits in poverty reduction,
economic development and social returns that basic education has been shown to generate
internationally. This section is based on extensive Bank Group economic and sector
work' completed for the first basic education project (Education Development in Poor
Provinces (CR. 2339-CHA) (EDPP) and work carried out by major Chinese research
institutions and scholars, and economic and financial analyses, including household
education spending surveys carried out during the Third and the current proposed Fourth
Basic Education Projects (BEIV). With ranging emphases, all four basic education
projects have been designed to address the following issues and constraints.
A detailed discussion of these issues can be found in China: Provincial Education Sector Planning and
Finance, Sector Study. The World Bank, China and Mongolia Departnent. Report No. 8657-CHA,
1991.



- 3 -
(a)   Access. Limited access to complete primary schools in poor and minority
areas continues to be a constraining factor to rural education development
in the nine project provinces Guizhou, Hainan, Heilongjiang, Hunan,
Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan and Yunnan. Schools offering full
primary education programs are not always within reasonable walking
distance from the homes of children in these areas. About 30 percent of
the rural primary schools in project counties are incomplete schools, i.e.,
they do not offer the full primary program and some offer only three or
even fewer grades. Small villages are served by "teaching points" which
offer only two grades, 1 and 3 or 2 and 4: project counties currently have
10,093 such "teaching points". Since complete primary schools may be
located 4-5 kilometers away from small villages and boarding schools are
costly, many children tend to discontinue their education after attending an
incomplete school, particularly girls from poor households. Improving
access to primary schooling will require continuing efforts to provide
better classroom and teacher capacity.
(b)   Poverty. Children from poor households are educationally disadvantaged,
compared with those from wealthier households. Their enrollment,
retention and completion rates are lower, and their dropout rates higher.
The education gap in rural areas is largely caused by the inability of
parents to afford the direct and indirect costs of schooling for their
children. Data from the Household Education Spending (HES) survey
(AnnexJ1) suggest that a household could spend as much as 20 percent of
their annual income. Parents responding to the survey identified low
incomes as the major reason for non-enrollment of their children.
(c)   Inequities. Gender disparity persists both in Han and minority societies:
about 70 percent of the 7-11 age cohort who are not enrolled in schools are
girls. This is more evident in eight provinces and autonomous regions
which include Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan,
Tibet, and Yunnan. A significant proportion of the population in these
regions belong to national minorities and broadly reflects the relatively
wider gender gap in enrollment rate among the minority groups. The
completion rates for boys and girls in 1991-92 were 94.2 percent and 89.3
percent respectively with girls constituting about 75 percent of drop-outs
from the primary cycle. While the literacy rate for male population of 15
years and older was 87 percent in 1990, it was only 68.1 percent for
females.  Sociocultural attitudes among some communities towards
education of girls, the relatively poor recognition of the benefits of
education for girls, school fees which constitute a substantial amount of
meager resources, need to assist families with income-generating
activities, and parental hesitation to send girls to co-educational schools
without female teachers are some of the reasons for lower enrollment and
retention rates for girls, especially those belonging to disadvantaged



-4-
population groups. The perceived lack of relevance of the school program
to the future development and occupational needs of girls also have
important bearing on attitudes to schooling.
(d)   Quality. Teacher effectiveness is limited. Nationally about 89 percent of
primary school teachers meet State-prescribed qualifications: however
regional disparities range from 94 percent in Liaoning to 49 percent in
Tibet. The average figure for project counties at this time is 66.5 percent
for primary school teachers and 33.4 percent for junior secondary.
Training courses are historically strong on content and weak on the
development of pedagogical skills.   Few  programs offer trainees
instructional methodologies suited to rural schools nor provide skills for
adapting the curriculum, prescribed teaching materials and equipment to
local conditions. Courses in multigrade teaching and bilingual instruction,
the latter required in minority schools, are not sufficiently widespread.
This often emphasizes the cultural discontinuity between school and
home, language of instruction and mother tongue. More than 37 percent
of primary school teachers are minban (community supported) teachers,
about 88 percent of whom are in rural areas. While significant efforts
have been made to develop a training network to periodically reorient
teachers to curriculum and methodological innovations, opportunities for
in-service training for experienced teachers in poor, remote and minority
areas continue to be inadequate. Teachers (and trainers) tend to be ill-
prepared to meet the diversity of individual pupil needs.  Science
education in rural schools remains weak relying largely on rote
memorization, and extremely disadvantaged in comparison with the
modernized facilities, equipment and techniques available in urban
schools. Consumable supplies and educational aids are either absent, or, if
available, under-utilized.
(e)   Low Efficiency. Rural primary and lower secondary schools are more
inefficient than their urban counterparts. This is evidenced by low
student-teacher ratios, incomplete schools, low completion rates, and low
girls' enrollments particularly in minority schools. A survey of 328
counties in 1992 found an inverse correlation between net income per
capita and drop-out and repetition rates; the lower the net income, the
higher the drop-out and repetition rates. Some estimates show that nearly
one-third of the children who enter grade 1 in poor areas drop out before
completing grade 5. Inadequately planned and managed teacher training
programs, both at pre-service and in-service levels, especially in poor rural
areas with relatively high levels of minority population, continue to hinder
progress towards universalization. Generally, there are no mechanisms to
identify efficiency-related issues and to provide and monitor corrective
measures.



(f)   Inadequate Financing.  Educational services which are seriously
underfinanced and which provide inadequate schooling facilities in poor
counties are a significant measure of urban-rural disparities. Buildings are
in such poor physical condition that they are listed officially as
"dangerous". In the Third Basic Education (Cr. 2831 -CHA) (BEIII)
project counties, 6 percent of primary schools and 5 percent of junior
secondary schools are officially listed as dangerous buildings. The school
environment is not conducive to learning; bilingual instruction facilities
are lacking in minority areas; costs of books have risen and instructional
equipment is scarce. The average figure for project county schools
meeting equipment standards for primary level is 52 percent decreasing to
32 percent for junior secondary schools. Distribution of teachers is uneven
between urban and rural areas; the low pay of minban teachers in poor
communities results in low motivation and a high turnover, resulting in
instability. Although average annual increase in real expenditure has
increased, most of this has funded teacher salaries and not better quality
instructional inputs to provide an effective learning environment.
(g)   Weak Management Capacity. The reform agenda (see para. 1.4) has
important implications for education management as Nine Year
Compulsory Education implementation accelerates to meet goals set for
2000. Inadequate management capacity for planning, implementing,
monitoring and evaluating reform programs for universalization of basic
education poses difficulties in poor counties. Several tiers of government
and administration are involved (central, provincial, county, village and
educational institution) which make management tasks complex:
appropriate structures are lacking to facilitate the systematic involvement
and assistance of the community in the planning and implementation of
primary education programs. While the SEdC management capacity has
been strengthened since the preparation of the first basic education project,
at a number of management levels there are shortages of qualified and
experienced planners, data-processors, statisticians and analysts.
Educational statistics and data on education financing, on school facilities,
and on staff deployment are often incomplete or inaccurate and therefore
provide insufficient information to identify and resolve efficiency
problems such as wasteful student to staff ratios, low teaching loads, low
utilization rates of facilities and equipment.
D. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
1.6   The Central Government's approach to address the above issues and constraints is
to develop broad principles and regulations to guide provincial and local governments
developing their county and village level education services, so that they may implement
the Compulsory Education Law using the resources available, and pursue their own
targets, according to their own means. Principles to be encouraged at the national level



- 6 -
include access/equity, quality and efficiency: (a) access/equity issues include State efforts
to subsidize economically undeveloped areas so that they may introduce, and where
necessary, expand compulsory education and to encourage the transfers of funds from
provincial to local governments; (b) quality improvement includes the introduction of
newly developed sets of more relevant and adequate books for basic education, training
of teachers to use the new text materials and provision of more pre-service and improved
in-service training for teachers; and (c) efficiency is seen as increased cost-effectiveness
in school management by reducing high repetition and drop-out rates, and adopting
adequate student-teacher ratios and teacher workloads.
1.7   Government's Education Strategy for Poverty Areas.  According to the
Education Law, the most important basic law in education which became effective on
September 1, 1995, the Government is charged with supporting and assisting the
development of education for national minorities as well as remote and poverty stricken
areas (Article 10). In keeping with the "Outline for Reform and Development of
Education in China," the State Council issued detailed suggestions in 1994 on the
implementation and planning for universalization of basic education, especially in poor
areas, which has been undertaken on the basis of different timescales, according to the
status of economic development as indicated in the following four categories:
(a)   Category 1: cities and selected rural areas with a fairly high level of
economic development and covering 40 percent of the nation's population.
Universalization targets in these areas are expected to be achieved by
1997.
(b)   Category 2: rural areas with medium level of economic development and
covering another 40 percent of the population. This category has already
achieved universal compulsory primary education and expects to meet
nine-year targets by 2000.
(c)   Category 3: rural areas with low levels of economic development
covering 15 percent of the country's population. For about 5 percent of
this group, in areas with a good primary education system, the nine-year
goal should be achieved by 2000. For the remaining 10 percent of this
group, efforts will be made to implement five or six years of basic
education.
(d)   Category 4: exceptionally poverty-stricken areas covering 5 percent of the
population. Efforts will be made to implement three to four year primary
education by 2000.

1.8  In order to reach overall universalization of basic education, targets proposed by
the State Council, SEdC will increase nonrecurrent categorical2 budgetary expenditures in
all provinces with nationally designated poor counties so that they can achieve universal
basic education by the year 2000. This is called the "Basic Education Program in Poor
Areas" and funding will be used for school construction, provision of teaching equipment
and library books, and teacher and principal training.
1.9   The special national fund established to finance the Basic Education Program in
Poor Areas amounted to 200 million yuan in 1995, and, by 1997, the additional resources
will amount to 800 million yuan. Between 1996-2000, SEdC will provide a total of 3.9
billion yuan to poor counties, with a matching 7.8 billion yuan expected from provinces
and counties. The additional funds will be used for capital, nonrecurrent costs of
improvement in school facilities, and the provision of equipment, furniture, and books.
1.10 The SEdC has adopted the International Development Association's (IDA) project
preparation and management procedure in deciding what basic education projects to
support with funds from the special fund and in managing the distribution of these funds
to the provinces. The SEdC now requires that provinces submit applications for funds
which are to be used in poverty areas, plans on how the funds are to be used, indicators
on their use, with full annual review and reporting on outcomes. As Beijing, Tianjin,
Shanghai, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jilin, Liaoning and Shandong have almost
achieved the goal of universalization of nine-year compulsory education, SEdC is
implementing the Basic Education Program in Poor Areas with a two-phase strategy:
- Phase One (1995-98) focuses on Category 2 poor counties in the 12 provinces of
Anhui, Fujian, Hainan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi,
Shanxi and Sichuan. These provinces account for approximately 40 percent of
China's population. There are 289 "8/7 Counties"3 in Phase One with a population of
some 110 million. The emphasis in Phase One is on junior secondary schooling.
* Phase Two (1995 through 1998 to 2000 and beyond) will focus on Category 3
counties in the nine provinces and autonomous regions of Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou,
Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, Tibet, Xinjiang and Yunnan, accounting for some
190 million population. There are 273 "8/7 Counties" in Phase Two with a poor
population of some 70 million. By 2000, 66 percent of Category 3 population would
have been covered, which will mean that almost 91 percent of the nation will have
2 Categorical funding refers to special targeted funding from the central government for school
construction and rehabilitation, and teacher training in national minority areas, national poor counties,
and former revolutionary base areas.
3 In January 1995 the Nine Year Compulsory Education (NYCE) by the Year 2000 policy statement
focused on achieving universal basic education in the 592 poor counties identified in the National Plan
to Reduce Poverty by the Year 2000 (the "8/7 plan", and hence "8/7 counties").

nine-year compulsory education coverage. The government's strategy for Category 4
population areas is to include them in Phase Two.
1.11   Since the focus for Phase One provinces is the achievement of Nine Year
Compulsory Education (NYCE), the proposed project will, compared with its
predecessors, have increased emphases on junior secondary schooling (grades 6-9 the last
three years of compulsory education). For Phase Two some 44 percent of provinces
would not have been covered by 2000, with the possibility of those in the poorest areas
receiving 4 years of education. Taking situational realities into account, the project has
been designed sufficiently flexibly to accommodate the varying priorities.
1.12 The Government's efforts include: (a) specially earmarked national funds for
construction and rehabilitation of schools in poor areas; (b) upgrading the professional
qualifications of minban teachers so that they can be converted to gongban (government
supported) teachers; (c) specially targeted funds to support payment of charges for books,
meals in boarding schools, and some transportation costs; (d) training of education
managers at the provincial and county level in methods to achieve efficiency gains by
using better resource allocation strategies and practices; and, (e) introduction of tax
reforms which broaden and deepen the base for tax collection, earmark percentages for
compulsory education, and allow for targeting of funds toward the poorer sections of the
provinces.
1.13   Government Strategy for Minority Education.  The evolution of China's
strategy for the provision of education for ethnic minorities has undergone changes in the
past four decades. For instance, in areas with large minority populations, there is
increasing use of minority languages as the initial medium of instruction at primary level,
with significant usage for classroom instruction although less widespread at secondary
level. The percentage of local content in primary school textbooks has been increased,
and levels of government-both local and national-support of teachers' salaries in
predominantly minority areas have been increased. Also, since the 1970's there has been
an increased recruitment of minority teachers and school principals, and greater efforts
made to train bilingual teachers.
1.14 Government policy on minority education can be seen in a number of other
systematic policy foci: (a) expanding access through: construction, expansion and
renovation of township/village schools, teaching points and multigrade-schools;
mandating universal 6-year education in all minority regions or an elementary graduate
per household as a minimum requirement for remote and scattered rural inhabitation;
development of a Center4 Elementary School for every township in each minority county
and a Center Secondary School and a Literacy and Vocational Training Center for each
minority county; (b) improving delivery and relevance of educational inputs by:
4 "Center" schools are generally town or county center level schools with additional faculty and funding
provided by the province or county to act as inservice teacher and principal training, local curricula
development and instructional equipment training sites.



- 9 -
improving teacher selection and preparation in pedagogy, bilingual education, curriculum
revision and development of bilingual materials for minorities; and (c) increasing the
resource base by developing preferential policies of increased national and provincial
resource allocation targeted at basic education in poor minority regions for specific
programs to reduce repetition and drop-out rates.
1.15 Government Strategy for Promoting Education of Girls. In the "Law of the
People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women," which
became effective on October 1, 1992, the Government recognizes the education of girls as
a societal responsibility. The Law states that: (a) "schools and departments concerned
shall, by implementing the relevant regulations of the state, guarantee that women enjoy
equal rights with men in such aspects as starting school, entering a higher school, job
assignment upon graduation, conferment of academic degrees and dispatch for study
abroad "(Article 15)"; and (b) "the governments, society and schools shall, in the light of
the actual difficulties of female school-age children or adolescents in schooling, take
effective measures to ensure that female school-age children or adolescents receive
compulsory education for the number of years locally prescribed" (Article 17).
1.16  Several other measures have been taken to create a supportive environment for the
promotion of girls' education. Legal protection for the rights and interests of women and
girls is enshrined in the Compulsory Education Law and The Law Regarding the Health
Care of Mother and Infants. The State Council issued the "Outline for Women
Development in China" right before the UN Fourth Conference on Women in Beijing,
and further highlighted the importance of girls' education to women's development and
social status. Publicity drives have been initiated and the Chinese Government has
expressed its determination to keep girls' dropout rate and lack of attendance to under
two percent. Teacher training is being strengthened, especially for female teachers and
principals. Social action in the form of financial assistance through the "Hope Project"
and the "Spring Bud Plan" illustrate national efforts to help retain girls in school by
lowering direct costs of schooling to parents.
1.17  In addition, a UNICEF-assisted project "Promoting Education of Girls in Poor
Areas," started in 1992, is being implemented in selected townships in 101 counties in
nine provinces (Anhui, Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan
and Yunnan). Specific strategies adopted under the project include, among others,
campaigns to generate parental awareness of the benefits of girls' education and to
overcome the socioeconomic barriers hindering participation of girls in education,
mobilization of parents and community leaders in activities designed to enhance
enrollment and retention of girls in schools, further increasing the proportion of trained
female teachers and principals and incorporation into the school curriculum learning
content that would enable girls to acquire the knowledge and skills relevant to their
socioeconomic needs; specific measures implemented in minority areas of Ningxia
include establishment of single-sex schools and single-sex classes and promoting
participation of religious leaders in enrollment campaigns and school improvement



- 10-
activities. Activities under the proposed project would help in enhancing enrollment and
retention of girls in the areas covered.
1.18 Assessment of Government Commitment. In addition to laws, policies, goals
and achievement criteria outlined above, recent actions have confirmed the government's
commitment to achieving universal basic education by the year 2000. In March 1995 the
Chinese National People's Congress passed the new Education Law which confirms these
ambitious goals for the year 2000 and directs the central, provincial and county
governments to develop educational programs which will achieve the goals. The Bank
preparation mission has reviewed the Government's Nine Year Compulsory Education
Plan and the Education Law and is in fundamental agreement with their content, direction
and intent. Over the last 15 years, processes and mechanisms established for planning,
implementation and management of earlier education projects have helped to develop
management capacity at the center and project provinces. This augurs well for the
remaining preparatory work and implementation. The earlier basic education projects
were developed and prepared within the same education policy context and the current
project furthers and strengthens the Bank's support for the Government's program of
improving China's Basic Education System.
E. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT
1.19 The Bank Group (IBRD and IDA) is in general agreement with the direction taken
by China in developing its educational policies and system at all levels. It provides
support to this process by maintaining a dialogue on sectoral issues and options, and by
supporting selected activities which contribute to access/equity, quality and efficiency. In
order to facilitate achievement of these ends, the Association's country assistance strategy
in the education sector in China is to: (a) support basic education with particular attention
to increasing access to quality schooling for the poor, minorities, and girls; (b) improve
the effectiveness of teaching services including the upgrading of educational
management, support services for principals and teachers, and teacher training; (c) assist
in the design and implementation of reforms in the education sector, especially in seeking
more equitable funding mechanisms, targeted to basic education in poor rural areas; and
(d) support institution building to increase the capacity of educational authorities at all
levels to carry out their responsibilities, especially under conditions of increasing
operational decentralization.
1.20 Rationale for IDA Involvement. This proposed lending operation is consistent
with the sector assistance strategy described above and the CAS discussed by the Board
on March 18, 1997. In particular, the project will support the poverty reduction and
human resources development objectives of the CAS, and will help the Government to
implement the National Poverty Reduction Plan (8/7 Plan). IDA's ongoing support to
China's efforts in improving basic education in poor and remote areas, including those
inhabited by minority nationalities, has been effective in improving the design and
implementation of such efforts. The proposed project would be consistent with the
findings of the Bank's report, "China: Strategies for Reducing Poverty in the 1990s,"



- 11 -
which identifies investment in human capital, in particular targeted intervention to the
poor and vulnerable, as a key component of poverty alleviation efforts, leading to
healthier and smaller families, higher rates of adopting new agricultural technology, and
increased access to alternative off-farm employment. The project also incorporates
IDA's concern for improving the status of women in the development process.
1.21  Past Bank Group Involvement in the Sector. In line with the above assistance
strategy, since 1981 the Bank Group has supported 18 projects in China that were either
devoted entirely to the education sector or had substantial education sector components.
More recently, as part of an integrated poverty reduction project, IDA is assisting the
development of primary education in the Southwest Property Reduction Project (Cr.
2744-CHA). The total loan and credit amount for education to date is $1,538.8 million.
Since the early 1980s, the trend in assistance has moved from other education subsectors
to basic education in poverty areas. These projects include 8 tertiary education projects,
two teacher training, two technical and vocational training, one on textbook development
for the basic level, one provincial development project and one municipality level
development project each of which includes an education component, and three for basic
education in poverty areas. The fourth basic education project comes on the heels of the
second (1995) and third (1996) basic education projects in support of the Government's
own recognition of education development as a major instrument in the eradication of
poverty.
1.22  Sector studies related to education finance were completed in 1986, 1991 and
1995. Other sector studies were done on technical/vocational education and training for
labor markets in 1987 and 1993, respectively, and informal sector work on teacher
training was carried out in 1991. Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grants have also
contributed to financial and curricula reform initiatives. These, combined with extensive
experience in preparing and supervising projects over the past decade, provide
considerable background for identification of sectoral needs and opportunities.
F. BANK EXPERIENCE AND LESSONS LEARNED
1.23  Lessons from Past Experience in China. Much of the same national level SEdC
project development team and the Chinese advisory group which worked on the EDPP,
Basic Education in Poor and Minority Areas (BEII) (Cr. 2651 -CHA) and BEIII projects is
intact and continues to work on the development of the current project. This staffing
continuity has facilitated incorporation into the proposed project design of valuable
lessons leamed from the development and early implementation of the EDPP, BEII,
BEIII projects. Similarly, many of the Bank Group and Chinese staff who worked on the
former project now work on the latter. The lessons include the following: (a) projects are
better designed and implemented when they concentrate on a reduced number of
provinces, and when provincial and county authorities are involved in their design;
(b) provincial level counterpart funding must be assured from the beginning of the
project, available early and sufficient to provide necessary start-up funds for county and
village civil works which account for a large percentage of the first half of project



- 12-
disbursements in such education projects; (c) the project oversight and policy guidance
role of the Chinese Experts Panel (CEP) has been critical in making minor but necessary
adjustments in project design, advising Bank supervision missions, and resolving
implementation problems at the provincial and sub-provincial levels; (d) Provincial
Education Commissions (PEdC) should concentrate less on quantitative targets and more
on improving the quality of the project-supported pre-service and in-service teacher
training; (e) provinces have tended to over-rely on early and heavy use of force account
for small civil works projects in locations where National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
procurement procedures would have been more appropriate and economical; (f) the
Association and the Government need to work together in the evaluation of education
reforms. Work has started on developing a standardized mechanism to measure student
attendance and indicators of educational achievement progress; and (g) national
coordination of technical assistance, high level training, collection of educational and
project indicators, and dissemination of lessons learned is necessary to achieve
efficiencies of scale, and country-wide coherence in the development and expression of
education policy and national standards (Annex2).
1.24 Lessons from International Experience. Project completion reports as well as
project audits undertaken by the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (OED), for
completed education projects worldwide include a variety of important lessons which can
be summarized as follows: (a) follow-up projects pursuing similar objectives to those of
previous projects help to strengthen and eventually consolidate earlier achievements,
which might otherwise falter and dissipate. Thus, follow-up projects should be part of a
long-term investment program with clearly defined objectives based on sound sector
work; (b) implementing agencies should have a strong sense of project ownership;
(c) borrowers should be committed to providing the necessary resources to support basic
education on a sustained basis; (d) project design should be sufficiently flexible to
accommodate mid-course corrections in scope, content and approach; (e) expert advisory
panels should be established to review implementation, address implementation issues,
and recommend on mid-course corrections; (f) increasing access for poor and minority
children and girls to quality primary education must be addressed by innovative
enrollment policies and student assistance programs.
1.25  The Proposed Project. The proposed project design benefited from the above
lessons by incorporating the following points: (a) the borrower and provincial education
authorities have been responsible for organizing the participation of stakeholders at the
provincial and county levels to develop proposals based on local identification of issues
and optimal solutions. Because this project is part of a unified program of projects in
basic education, this process was facilitated by using experienced staff, educational
advisors and models from earlier projects; (b) a CEP has been used to assist in the design
of project components and will be used during project implementation to provide ongoing
high level professional monitoring of project implementation; (c) a county financing
study and household survey has been completed to better understand what the necessary
government and non-government commitment is for sustaining appropriate levels of
support for basic education; (d) inclusion of a student assistance program with special



- 13 -
consideration to be given to girls and minorities; and (e) a component to be included in
the project aims at supporting dissemination of previous IDA- and UNICEF-supported
action-oriented research programs that identify innovative approaches to improving
access to basic education for girls, minorities and poor children.

2. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND DEVELOPMENT
A. PROJECT BACKGROUND
2.1  In proposing the Fourth Basic Education project, the Government has asked IDA
to support educational programs in nine poor provinces-Guizhou, Hainan, Heilongjiang,
Hunan, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan and Yunnan-as it has done in three previous
projects, EDPP, BEII, and BEIII. This project, and the other three projects combined,
will cover a total of 364 (61 percent) of the 592 national poor counties designated in the
Government of China's (GOC) National Plan to Reduce Poverty by the Year 2000. The
total number of provincially-designated poverty counties, a designation used to denote
counties not on the national poverty list but with similarly low levels of rural per capita
income and grain production, covered by all four projects would amount to 90. With
universal basic education targets having been achieved in the cities and the coastal, more
economically developed areas, the need to accelerate the effort in rural, poor and minority
areas is now being addressed. The proposed project is part of this effort, by providing
cost-effective support to assuring universal access to quality primary education and
increasing the coverage of junior secondary education in 95 national poverty counties and
22 provincial poor counties. (See Annex 3 for more details on the coverage of poverty
counties.)
2.2   The project will contribute to the Government's poverty reduction efforts by
improving the income earning potential of more than 6.2 million children in some of the
poorer counties in China. The project will have a direct impact on approximately 29,160
schools and will provide varying lengths of training for approximately 138,000 teachers
and education managers. The project design has taken cognizance of a rich array of
information sources. These include: the cumulative experiences of SEdC, IDA and
provincial teams involved in the preparation of previous basic education and other
education projects; local and international scholarship, research and experience
particularly in the areas of poverty reduction and human capital development, and the
education of disadvantaged groups including girls and minorities; the experiences of UN
agencies such as UNDP, UNESCO and UNICEF and working closely, including
participation in missions, with some of their Beijing-based staff; economic and financial
analyses for BEIII and for the current project including HES surveys; and minority
participation through structured interviews by SEdC teams based on IDA-developed
instruments used in BEIII, involvement of national and provincial education experts from
minority nationalities in project design and preparation, and county-level project design
discussions carried out by both IDA preparation teams and provincial education staff.



- 15 -
B. PROJECT DESIGN
2.3   Project Design.  The project is designed with two programs, the National
Program (NP) which includes 91 counties in the provinces of Guizhou, Hainan,
Heilongjiang, Hunan, Shanxi and Yunnan and the Qinba Village Primary Education
Program (QVPEP) which includes 26 counties in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Ningxia. The
QVPEP, originally part of the multisectoral Qinba Mountains Poverty Reduction Project
(QMPRP), to be presented to the Board in June 1997, has been included in BEIV at the
request of the GOC. The GOC indicated that in their experience multisectoral projects
have been more efficiently implemented when sectoral ministries assumed primary
responsibility for project design, preparation and implementation. Thus, the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) requested the SEdC and the provincial education commissions of
Sichuan, Ningxia and Shaanxi to take responsibility for the design, preparation and
implementation of the QVPEP.
2.4   The QVPEP will be administered by the provincial education commissions with
central guidance and support from the SEdC. The QVPEP will be implemented in the
same counties and townships as the QMPRP, thus supporting the QMPRP's multisectoral
approach to poverty reduction. The goals of the QVPEP program are similar to those of
the National Program and many of the financing, implementation, monitoring modalities
will be the same, and therefore there is merit in combining this program with the other six
provinces of the National Program to become an integral part of BEIV.
2.5   The key educational issues to be addressed by the project were identified through
studies carried out jointly by the Association and members of the Chinese education
research community as well as from the three previous education projects. Likewise,
identification of the key poverty intervention issues to be addressed in the project resulted
from studies carried out jointly by the Association and Chinese social scientists. These
studies were discussed with SEdC. Priorities for project focus were determined in the
course of project identification and preparation.  Special attention was given to
procedures for selecting project provinces and, more importantly, counties (including
those with substantial minority populations). Emphasis was also placed on the design of
appropriate training and management development programs, formulation of national
seminars and setting up a system to carry out the innovation programs provided for under
the project. All of these topics were discussed and settled upon jointly by the Association
and Government staff during project preparation and appraisal.
2.6   The project has been designed to further develop the borrower's capacity to
prepare, implement, monitor and evaluate education projects in the future, whether
supported with government funding and special categorical grants (see paras. 1.6-1.12 for
details), or donor agency financing. Building on the prior projects, IDA and SEdC
prepared nine subprojects, one for each province.  The project will support the
government's efforts to make primary education universal by the year 2000, with a
special focus on disadvantaged groups including poor children in remote villages,
minority groups, and girls. The proportion of minority groups in project counties ranges



- 16-
from 17 percent to 50 percent in five of the project provinces, with Hunan 17 percent,
Hainan 31 percent, Ningxia 34 percent, Yunnan 36 percent and Guizhou 50 percent.5
2.7   This project will continue to emphasize the education objectives of access, equity,
quality and education management improvement, building on a program of activities
which characterize Bank-supported basic education projects in poverty areas in China.
Common to both the National Program and the QVPEP are the construction and repair of
school buildings, supply of equipment, furniture and books, training of teachers,
principals, education managers and project implementation staff, with the NP targeting
primary and junior secondary levels and the QVPEP the primary. Both programs include
the development of a student assistance facility but this has added emphasis in the
QVPEP. Pilot sub-components such as the Teacher Services Network, a Textbook Rental
Scheme in Shanxi Province, and the dissemination of successful practice in girls' and
minority education will be included in the NP.
2.8   Strategies responding to the remote locations of the project areas include the
building of single classroom schools in sparsely-populated locations and the support of
multigrade approaches to school organization, teaching, curriculum and development of
materials. Low enrollment, drop-out and completion rates will be addressed by
supporting the upgrading of teaching qualifications and training of principals as well as
targeted student assistance initiatives. In order to improve participation and retention
rates of girls, the project will continue with measures found to be successful in earlier
Bank and other donor agency projects. Such measures include house-to-house visits by
school or village committee officials, awareness campaigns, and guidance and counseling
for families. To respond to the needs of minority populations in the NP (the Hui minority
in the QVPEP do not use a separate language), the project will improve and expand
bilingual teaching, and finance the development, printing and distribution of minority
textbooks.
2.9   Two UN agencies based in the field, namely, UNDP and UNICEF, have
contributed to project preparation in areas where they have had significant experiences in
China (such as education for girls and minority groups). Cooperative work was
coordinated by SEdC who will continue to oversee collaboration during implementation.
This is consistent with recommendations from the External Advisory Board on Education
(March 1996) to work in partnership with agencies which have common objectives in
client countries, while providing Bank's counterparts in China the opportunity to
strengthen their capacity in coordinating development inputs from various agencies.
2.10  Equally consistent with current Bank strategy in project development is the effort
to pilot innovative components.6 These include continued attempts to establish an

Biyi, Dong, Gelao, Lisu, Miao, Yao, Yi; Heilongjiang: Meng; Hainan: Li; Hunan: Dong, Tujia;

expanded and sustainable student assistance mechanism which was started in BEIII; a
Textbook Rental Scheme in Shanxi Province to reduce education expenditure costs for
poor households; a renewal of selected elements in the junior secondary teacher training
curriculum in Yunnan Province; and a Teacher Services Network (TSN) designed to
support rural village school teachers with the aim of reducing their professional isolation.
A subpilot in the TSN is a collaborative venture between the Bank's Asia Alternative
Energy Unit and the Center for Renewable Energy Development of the State Planning
Commission, overseen by SEdC. This activity aims to demonstrate the value of solar
photovoltaic systems in providing access to communications, distance learning, and
lighting services for teachers and students in unelectrified areas in two counties. Data
from the pilot will enable the SEdC to estimate its potential applicability in educational
programs across China (see project files for details of the subpilot).
2.11   National Program. In the NP, the total population of the 91 project counties is
about 30 million, of which 7.8 million are considered poor by the Chinese Government.
(See IBRD Map No. 27816.) This is approximately 2.3 percent of the number of people
the World Bank estimates remain in poverty in China or 13.3 percent of the number
estimated by the Government.' Minorities constitute approximately 19 percent of the
population served by the project, accounting for about 20 percent of the minority
population in the six provinces. The primary and junior secondary schools in project
counties include about 4.7 million students.
2.12   Provincial Selection and Targeting Strategy.  Selection of NP-supported
provinces and counties has been carried out within the government's poverty reduction
and compulsory education strategies and the Bank's own poverty alleviation guidelines
laid out in the CAS. The NP provinces (Guizhou, Hainan, Heilongjiang, Hunan, Shanxi,
and Yunnan) are on the SEdC's priority list for universalization of basic education.
(Other provinces on this priority list were included in the first three basic education
projects, EDPP, BEII and BEIII.) Program-supported counties are either national level
poverty counties on the National 8/7 Poverty Reduction list published in 1994 as part of
the GOC's National 8/7 Plan to Reduce Poverty by the Year 2000, or provincial poverty
counties.
2.13   There is a small number of counties in the proposed project which were included
in earlier basic education projects. The reason for this is twofold: (a) targeting of
investments in earlier projects focused more on township complete primary schools rather
than the village schools which predominate in BEIV, and (b) limited financial resources
meant that from the start it was not expected that the earlier projects would cover all
6 See "Getting Results: The World Bank's Agenda for Improving Development Effectiveness." World
Bank, Report No. 12205, July 1993.
7 The number of Chinese absolute poor depends on the poverty line used. Using the national definition
of poverty results in a range between 65 to 100 million poor, whereas the number jumps to 350 million
if international norms of minimum acceptable living standards are used. See Poverty in China: What
do the Numbers Say?, World Bank background note, June 1996.



-18-
needy schools in a particular county. Problems still exist in the education programs for
these counties and therefore the Government has asked IDA to return to them with
additional attention and financing. The proposed project will also include a small number
of these provincial poverty counties in provinces where there are no additional national
poverty counties in which IDA supported investments in education need to be made at
this time.
2.14 Allocation Formula for Project Funds. Allocation of IDA funds among the NP
provinces was based on a formula (see Annex.A) which gives priority to the number of
poor counties (both national and provincial) within a province and the population of these
counties. A sixteen-point weighted scale (see project files for weighted scale) developed
and used in the Basic Education II and III projects were used in making proposed
allocation of IDA funds within provinces themselves. This scale takes into account such
items as the area of dangerous classrooms, percentages of unqualified teachers and
percentage of female enrollments. This allocation formula will be used for the initial
draft project financing plans, and may be modified as the project preparation process
continues.
2.15  Sub-County Focus. As the primary focus of the project is to build up education
capacity in poor areas of China's national poverty counties, an important consideration is
the targeting of project investments at levels within counties where the greatest poverty
exists. Earlier Bank Group sector work indicated that this is generally at the town and
village levels outside the county center. Therefore, project investments will, for the most
part, be made at the town and village and not the county, city or municipality levels.
Project investments and training will be focused at the subcounty level.
2.16 Impact on Nonproject Counties. Because the need for increased educational
inputs manifestly exists in poor counties not covered by the project, the provincial
governments of the six National Program provinces have provided financing and action
plans for educational inputs to national poverty counties not supported by the project.
(See Annex 5 for the levels of committed provincial funding for nonproject counties and
Annex 6 for nonproject county indicators.) At negotiations assurances were obtained
that these Project provinces will: (a) implement acceptable programs for nonproject
counties designed to ensure the continued achievement of acceptable educational targets
in these counties during the implementation of the project; (b) monitor these programs on
the basis of indicators acceptable to the Association; and (c) prepare and furnish to the
Borrower for forwarding to IDA at project Mid-Term a report on this monitoring.
2.17 In this fashion the IDA credit inputs, coupled with the provinces' own financing
for nonproject supported counties, will provide a broader program approach to strengthen
basic education in all of a province's poor counties. This approach will also increase the
institutional capacity of the SEdC and other provinces to prepare further poverty-focused
basic education projects.

2.18 Qinba Village Primary Education Program. The QVPEP will take place in 26
mountainous and remote poor counties of Sichuan (12 counties), Shaanxi (10 counties)
and Ningxia (4 counties), all of which are nationally designated poor counties under the
8-7 Plan and are also on SEdC's priority list for universation of basic education (para.
1.7). The project area comprises two distinct physiographic regions: twenty-two counties
in northeast Sichuan and southern Shaanxi, stretching along the Qinling and Dabashan
Mountains; and four counties in southwestern Ningxia in the Loess Plateau. Project
locations and area information are given in IBRD Map No. 27815. Within the 26 project
counties, the project area comprises the poorest 2941 administrative villages (or about a
quarter of the total number of administrative villages in the project counties) with a total
rural population of 2.3 million people. The Sichuan and Shaanxi project area has
2.08 million beneficiaries, of which less than one percent are ethnic minorities. The
Ningxia project area has about 0.24 million people, nearly 80 percent of whom are Hui
ethnic minority people. The Hui comprise seven percent of the total number of project
beneficiaries.
2.19 Counties. About 6 million, or more than one-tenth, of China's remaining
absolute poor reside in the remote Qinba mountains region of Sichuan and Shaanxi and
loess hills of Ningxia. The 26 project counties are among the poorest of the 8-7 Plan
counties, with 1995 average rural per capita income levels ranging between Y 586 to 634,
and per capita grain production ranging between 206 kg to 365 kg in that year. Poverty
incidence, income levels and grain production for the project counties and townships, the
three project provinces, and China are shown in Table 2.1. These data show that between
one-third to three-quarters of the rural population of the project counties are absolutely
poor. This level of poverty is six to ten times greater than the incidence of rural poverty
at the national level, and several times greater than the respective provincial incidences.
Average rural per capita income and grain production in the project counties are also
substantially less than the provincial and national averages.

2.20   The 26 QVPEP counties, although among the poorest in the three project
provinces, account for less than 10 percent of the number of total counties (a total of



- 20 -
294). The number of counties was limited in order to make the maximum possible
impact on the education needs in the target counties, and therefore, the percentage of
provincial coverage provided by the QVPEP is about one half the geographical coverage
provided under the National Program. Since there is such a large number of nonproject
counties in each province (e.g., the ratio of project to nonproject counties in Sichuan is
12:174) and the relatively small percentage of project funds, (which represents less than 1
percent of the total provincial education budgets), it was confirmed that the project would
not be able to monitor the nonproject county education programs.
2.21 Townships and Villages. The exclusion of about two thirds of the townships in
the project counties allows for the targeting of adequate investments to the very poorest
villages. The incidence of poverty in the project townships ranges between 75 percent in
Shaanxi to 88 percent in Ningxia, or between nine to twelve times greater than the
national average rate.
2.22  Selection Process. To target meaningful levels of educational assistance to the
very poorest households in the project area, the QVPEP Program could include only a
limited number of project counties and a subset of townships and administrative villages
within those counties. The principal criteria for the selection of project townships and
administrative villages were below average per capita income levels and grain
production. As illustrated in the IBRD Map No. 27815, an effort was also made to select
townships and administrative villages in continuous project area blocks in order to
improve ease of project implementation.
2.23  The 26 counties covered by the QVPEP represent areas of absolute poverty
covered in Category 3 and 4 of the Government's 1994 "Outline for Reform and
Development of Education in China" (see para. 1.6-1.12). In these areas the national
education goals for the year 2000 call for universalization of three to four years of
primary education with junior secondary goals to be achieved somewhat later in the new
century. However, as project design for the QVPEP portion of the project stresses
developing higher levels of numeracy and literacy, skill levels seen as necessary to escape
poverty, the 26 counties in the QVPEP portion of the project seek to increase enrollments
so that a full six years of schooling will be provided. In order to achieve the five or six
years of schooling the QVPEP has incorporated a more robust student assistance program
than the National Program. The aim of this student assistance program is to ensure that
children in these very poor project areas will not be deprived of schooling for financial
reasons. Estimates differ as to the total number of school age children in QVPEP who are
out of school, but based on 1990 census statistics the most reasonable estimate is that of
the 321,000 school aged children in the project, 15 percent or 48,000 are not enrolled, and
for those not enrolled, approximately 34,000 are not in school for poverty reasons. (The
provincial authorities calculate that approximately 70 percent of children not enrolled are
out of school for economic/poverty reasons. Using a unit cost of Y 50/year for student
support, an estimated $3.0 million over the life of the projects will be necessary to both
keep those children in school who would drop out because of economics reason and bring
those children into school who are not now enrolled for economic reasons.

C. PROJECT PREPARATION AND PARTICIPATION
2.24 Borrower Involvement in Project Preparation. Based on experience with the
previous projects, SEdC organized three working groups used by both the National
Program and the QVPEP which were instrumental in preparation and will be used in
project implementation. These groups are: (a) a Project Working Group, comprising
working level staff from SEdC's Departments of Finance, Foreign Investment and Loan
Office (FILO), Minority Education, Basic Education, Equipment, Teacher Training and
Supervision, which has been responsible for organizing all project preparatory activities;
(b) the Project Leading Group, comprising the directors of departments represented in the
first group and responsible for providing guidance and coordination and resolving major
implementation issues that may arise; and (c) the Project Expert Consultative Group,
comprising 7-9 non-SEdC experts specializing in basic education, minority/bilingual
education, teacher training, curriculum development, civil works, equipment and
education management, which advised and made suggestions on project preparation.
2.25  Local Participation in NP Project Preparation and Design. Participatory
methods have been followed in the design of the project components. The SEdC's initial
organization meeting in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, sought and received provincial level
stakeholder commitment to the project concept and, based on this agreement, the
provinces provided their first set of project proposals which were reviewed by the
May, 1996, mission. The provinces themselves, in their preparation of the proposals,
took county realities and priorities into consideration which is evidenced by varying
investment priorities requested by county and township authorities. Village committees
and school principals discussed project design issues. These issues were primarily
priorities in proposed project investment at the school level, provision of student
assistance to poor children and participation in the development of local content for the
curriculum with provincial, national and Bank preparation teams. (It was a headmaster in
Hunan who told the mission about his experience in textbook rental schemes that led to
the mission's consideration of the feature.) Provinces and counties have the flexibility to
exclude or modify characteristics of project components based on their own needs
assessment exercises.
2.26 Local Participation in QVPEP Project Preparation. To ensure that the
QVPEP targeted the population group a household survey was conducted. The survey
sample consisted of four counties in each of the three QVPEP project provinces and
approximately 30 percent of the counties households. Using data from the survey, the
sample counties, along with the other project counties, established criteria for selecting
project townships and natural villages that would participate in the project. (See
para. 2.20-2.23.) The survey results also showed that most parents view education fees
and expenses as major impediments to their ability to provide an education for their
children. The comments by the parents lead to the expanded student assistance program
that has been incorporated into the QVPEP component of this project.



- 22 -
2.27 NP Education for Minorities. As improving education for the minorities is an
objective of this program, project provinces will pay special attention to increasing
participation and completion rates of the minorities. This can be achieved by continuing
with measures that have proved to be successful in the past while reinforcing them with
new measures. These include campaigns for implementing the Compulsory Education
Law among the minorities, regular home visits to minority families, and specific social
support or welfare systems for the minorities, such as the Hope Project and Student
Assistance Program, etc. To enhance girls' school attendance and retention rates, project
provinces will provide prevocational, potentially income-generating and skills training
courses in junior secondary schools and strengthen bilingual education for the non-Han
speaking minorities to increase their employment opportunities. Project counties with a
small proportion of minorities include in their teaching curricula a range of minority-
focused materials including: stories and songs from the local oral tradition; inclusion of
major points in local minority history in the history courses; dances and skits based on
local minority culture and contributions of the local minorities to the economic
development of the area.
2.28 NP Minority Participation Interviews. During the preparation of BEIII,
specific efforts were made to solicit input from people in minority areas with a view to
enhancing project responsiveness to the needs and aspirations of communities. Building
on this experience and assisted by local researchers, the SEdC organized documented
structured interviews to involve minority stakeholders in decision-making.  These
discussions, involving parents, grandparents, teachers and principals, village education
committee members and local village leaders, focused primarily on the local education
priorities. In addition to these structured interviews, local county-level education offices,
using input from village and township education committees, drafted project plans which
were based on local, including minority, considerations and these plans were used to
produce the provincial plans which were appraised by IDA. The main findings of BEIII
and BEIV, which had significant inputs into research design, may be summarized as
follows:
*  Only by acquiring literacy and numeracy skills will the children be able to
escape the poverty of their parents/grandparents; it was worth their while to
overcome family difficulties to ensure schooling for their children;
*  "Educational difficulties" are considered to be inadequate or unsafe buildings
and facilities; books and other teaching/learning materials; and insufficient
number of teachers with experience in bilingual teaching;
*  The project should place strong emphasis on eliminating dangerous schools
and providing good new classrooms which will attract children and qualified
teachers;



- 23 -
*  It was important that teachers and principals received further training to
provide quality education for their children and that teachers possess bilingual
education skills;
*  Basic education in rural poor areas is primarily to acquire skills necessary to
contribute to the local economy and secondarily to provide an educational
foundation for higher education;
*  Mastery of the national language is essential in preparing school-leavers to
move from poverty areas, even within a province, to where the jobs are;
*  Initial instruction in the mother language is important to retain awareness of
minority culture and to be able to communicate with family members;
2.29  Of lesser importance but still necessary is the provision of school furniture and
teaching equipment. It is important for the curriculum to include stories of local model
citizens and the history and stories of the local culture; some thought local culture alone
would spoil the chances of their children in province-wide or nation-wide competition so
both school curricular content should have a balance of both. Work initiated by the SEdC
in BEII and BEIII on the development of locally relevant curriculum materials will
continue in BEIV with local communities and Village Education Committees (composed
of grandparents, parents and village leaders including, in minority areas, minority
representation) providing the lead and indicating local area needs. Education of girls is
important so that they can learn life skills which enable them to contribute to the local
economy. Parents, especially mothers, were of the opinion that the isolation of schools
and having to stay in boarding schools discouraged school retention and completion
particularly for girls.
2.30 Household Education Spending Survey of NP Provinces. In addition, and
following and refining the successful piloting of such efforts in BEIII, the preparation
team surveyed household attitudes toward the project design in four sample counties
through household interviews and gathering of household data on education spending.
These discussions primarily focused on priorities in proposed project investment at the
school level, provision of student assistance to poor children and special needs in the
development of local content for curriculum. In the four counties surveyed in Shanxi and
Yunnan Provinces, education spending was a heavy economic burden for a significant
proportion of households. For 22-40 percent of the households, HES accounted for at
least 20 percent of total household spending and for 22-31 percent of the households,
HES accounted for at least 20 percent of household net income. HES per child increased
sharply with the level of schooling (although this varied substantially across the four
counties): in 1995 HES averaged Y 190 for primary education and 482 for junior
secondary education.  The household survey has lead to an innovative project
component-a pilot textbook rental scheme. (See para. 3.14 and Annex 7 for details on
the textbook rental scheme.)



- 24 -
2.31   This combination of interview and survey procedures gave a balanced perspective
on the issues such as the adequacy of local content in the curriculum, the use of the
mother tongue as the language of instruction, and their level of support for the proposed
Textbook Rental Scheme. Supervision missions in earlier Bank-supported education
projects have shown that there is substantial variation in how each county in a project has
actually designed their county-level projects, which is responsive to local educational
needs and economic realities. The supervision missions have found that this variation in
county-level design seems to be closely linked to the stated desires of village level
education committees and the balance that the township level education offices bring to
the priority selection process. Participation is good and local commitment is high.
Project components have been and will continue to be designed around local as well as
national goals and targets, especially in minority areas.
2.32  Taking the findings of the economic and financial analysis, the results of the
household surveys, the minority participation interviews and the previous design
experience from Basic Education II and III into account, the proposed project design will
include: (a) increased bilingual teacher training; (b) purchase of minority language
supplementary and library reading materials, where appropriate; (c) development of local
content for curricula; (d) identification and training of minority-especially female
minority-headteachers or principals; (e) research at the normal school level in effective
teaching methods (both culturally and linguistically) to be used in minority areas;
(f) active village committee participation in village school activities especially in the
local content portion of the curriculum; (g) special consideration be given to minorities in
setting criteria for the student assistance programs and ensuring that actual funds will be
monitored; (h) all elements of minority participation at village education committee level
will be monitored on an on-going basis by the CEP, which will modify activities as
appropriate at Mid-Term; write a final report at project completion; and monitoring
arrangements will be included in final negotiation documents.

3. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.1   To address the sector issues discussed in para. 1.5, the project aims to:
(a)   Increase access/equity for the absolute poor in primary and junior
secondary education in poor and minority areas to achieve universal
primary education and the expansion of junior secondary education, with
particular attention to girls and minority nationalities;
(b)   Enhance quality in primary and junior secondary schooling, and the
corresponding teacher education and training of trainers' programs; and
(c)   Improve efficiency in the delivery of education through improving
educational management at national, provincial, county and project
institutional levels.
3.2   These proposed project objectives are consistent with GOC's goal of achieving
NYCE by the year 2000. They are also consistent with the World Bank's policy goals of
supporting poverty reduction in China by improving basic education in poor and minority
areas, and of casting project activities within the framework of the GOC's National Plan
to Reduce Poverty by the Year 2000.
3.3   Key Project Monitoring and Development Impact Indicators. For the Bank to
monitor and evaluate overall performance and development impact in both programs of
the project in relation to the project objectives of access/equity, quality and efficiency,
key performance and impact indicators have been developed jointly by IDA and SEdC
(Annex 8 provides targets to be achieved by each of the nine provinces) on the basis of
experience in the three earlier basic education projects. They will use data from the
performance indicators provided by project provinces as well as other information
provided by SEdC and the PEdCs, particularly data disaggregated by gender and minority
nationality. The nine indicators are: Access/Equity: (i) student enrollment, (ii) number of
students receiving financial assistance; Quality: (iii) proportion of qualified teachers at
primary and junior secondary levels and at normal levels, and (iv) proportion of qualified
bilingual teachers in primary schools in counties, (v) lab opening hours per week for
normal schools; Efficiency: (vi) student completion rates for primary and junior
secondary schools, (vii) transition rates from primary to junior secondary, (viii) dropout
rates for primary and junior secondary, (ix) student learning achievement indicators in
language and mathematics for primary and junior secondary schools with the addition of
physics for the latter.



-26 -
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION-NATIONAL PROGRAM (NP)
3.4   To achieve improved access/equity, the project will pOovide for civil works
construction, equipment, furniture, books and other instructional materials to primary and
junior secondary schools in poor, minority and remote areas. To enhance quality,
teachers and principals will be provided training to upgrade professional content and
practical skills. Equipment and staff training will be provided to a small number of
normal schools which train primary school teachers and which serve poor and minority
areas as well as a small proportion of trainers in normal colleges which train junior
secondary school teachers. To improve education management, the project will provide
training for educational managers and for the development and utilization of educational
management information services. About 90 percent of IDA Credit for the National
Program will be allocated to primary and junior secondary education, 7 percent to Normal
Schools and about 3 percent for management. Of the allocation for primary and
secondary schooling, proportions will reflect individual provincial situations with not less
than 54 percent for primary and not more than 46 percent for junior secondary education.
3.5   Utilizing allocated Credit proceeds, each participating province will implement
Education Programs comprising activities from the three project components which are
described below.
Access To Nine Year Compulsory Education Component (NYCE) (Base Cost $93.23
million)
3.6   The project would support the Borrower's efforts to: (a) provide approximately
380,000 additional places during the project period and improve the highly inadequate
existing facilities (in about 5 percent of schools) in primary and junior secondary schools
through civil works; (b) provide existing and new schools with equipment and furniture;
(c) help poor students gain access to basic education through the Student Assistance
Program which will help to expand existing scholarship programs; and (d) reduce the cost
of textbooks to parents and help to remove a barrier in access to basic education by
piloting a Textbook Rental Scheme in Shanxi Province.
3.7   Civil Works (Base cost $66.62 million). The project would finance civil works
for primary and junior secondary schools in 91 project counties according to SEdC and/or
Provincial space planning and construction guidelines. The scope of works in primary
and junior schools would include: (a) repairs to existing structures which are in poor
physical condition with an estimated cost of Y 38.5 million for some 293,400 m2;
(b) replacement of unsafe, dangerous structures (identified by communities as a high
priority) with an estimated cost of Y 113.7 million for some 242,400 M2; and
(c) construction of new schools in underserved counties on existing property for which no
new land acquisition will be required and expansion of existing schools through
additional classrooms, libraries, laboratories, and dormitories. The new construction of
some 889,700 m2 is estimated to cost Y 386 million (Annex9). Planning (including
training) for civil works is at an advanced stage of preparation for construction scheduled



- 27 -
to start in early 1997 through retroactive financing from the project. By 2002, the project
is expected to provide 243,000 new places at the primary level and 135,000 at the junior
secondary level, amounting to a total of 378,000.
3.8   Architectural and engineering designwork for building construction and repair has
been undertaken which are cost-effective and satisfactory to the Association. The
requirements of buildings in areas prone to earthquake and floods have been taken into
account in the engineering plans. Construction will be handled by county construction
bureaus or companies with the support of the provincial construction departments or -
where capabilities at the county level are inadequate - entirely by the latter.
3.9   Unit costs for civil works will reflect local variations, particularly in areas which
are prone to earthquakes and floods. Implementation of civil works will be phased over
five years with priority given to the replacement of dangerous structures. Building
construction will be phased so as to integrate with such essentially related activities as the
procurement of equipment, furniture and books, and staff training. School maintenance
plans will be prepared annually for project-supported schools. During negotiations,
provinces provided acceptable maintenance plans including funding levels; for the
duration of the project.
3.10  Equipment and Furniture (Base Cost $25.60 million).   The learning
environment in the primary and junior secondary schools of counties-supported by both
parts of the project-would be improved through the provision of equipment and
fiurniture.   These provisions, based on the SEdC  guidelines, would include:
(a) equipment for some 10,178 schools estimated to cost Y 122.5 million; and (b) some
668,000 sets of furniture with costs estimated at Y 34 million (Annex 1Q). Marked
discrepancies exist between instructional equipment available in more affluent areas and
that in poor, rural counties. This disparity is reflected in classrooms where the absence of
basic instructional aids such as maps, wall charts, measuring devices and even the simple
scientific equipment required by the junior secondary school curriculum results in
teaching methodologies based on didactic, rote-memory approaches.
3.11   SEdC classifies equipment needs according to "Standard Levels" which are based
on school size, hierarchy (e.g., central school) and teacher training responsibility;
conducts periodic surveys to assess current levels and new procurement needs; and
together with PEdCs and County Education Bureaus has, for this project, identified
specific requirements for project-supported schools. Equipment lists have been prepared
and reviewed, using criteria acceptable to the Association. Approved programs will
provide inservice training for equipment utilization.
3.12  Student Assistance. To reduce the burden on poor families, a student assistance
program will be piloted in all of the project counties much along the lines established
under the BEIII project. Approximately I to 5 percent of the project's counterpart funds
will be allocated to this subcomponent. HES surveys and discussions with minority
groups identified schooling costs as a serious obstacle to school enrollment. The



- 28 -
counterpart funds for this subcomponent will be put into a student assistance fund and the
interest proceeds from the fund will be used to provide assistance to approximately
46,000 children at primary and junior secondary levels. Pupils will not receive cash
payments. Depending on need, they will receive varying amounts of reductions and
waivers in payments for textbooks, miscellaneous fees, and other schooling-related costs.
Working within the framework set up by SEdC, the project provinces will develop their
own criteria for: (a) eligibility for assistance and selection criteria; (b) targeting and
assistance (in particular for female and minority students); (c) financing of the fund; and
(d) management and monitoring of the program. Assisted by the CEP, SEdC and
provinces will jointly monitor and evaluate the program.
3.13  These efforts show the recognition of student assistance as an effective measure in
increasing enrollment rates and reducing poor families' financial burden. However, in
spite of strong national and provincial support for the scheme, funds are currently
insufficient to filly cover the needs. Project provinces have developed a program plan
for the years 1997-2002 to indicate coverage of students and financing sources for the
fund. Each National Program Province must establish student assistance programs with
full initial deposits by September 1, 1998, after providing IDA with theit program
information and their deposits by August 1, 1998.
3.14 Pilot Textbook Rental Scheme. The HES Survey has shown that the economic
burden of education is an important contributing factor to parents' decision not to send
their children to school. To reduce the private cost of education in poor families, the
project will pilot a textbook rental scheme (see Annex 7 for detailed guidelines) in Shanxi
Province aimed at reducing the cost of textbooks, with the objectives of improving access
to education, improving efficiency in the utilization of scarce education resources, and
promoting students' discipline and care for books. In the pilot activity, parents will pay
the full cost (approximately Y 70) of a set of textbooks at the beginning of the school
year. At the end of the school year, parents may return the books for a partial refund or
credit for purchasing the following year's textbooks. The amount of refund or credit will
depend on the condition of the returned still usable textbooks. The scheme would involve
the first six grades in 4 village primary schools in two counties in Shanxi Province. The
investment will be largely for protective plastic book covers; bookshelves; training; and
materials for managing activities and documenting of records. The activity will be
managed by the Shanxi PEdC assisted by researchers from the Higher Education Institute
of Taiyuan Industrial University. A project implementation group, comprising school
principals and instructional staff including project class teachers, will be set up. An
interim evaluative report on lessons learned will be reported and shared with project
provinces during the Mid-Term Review.
Education Quality Enhancement Component (Base Cost $13.39 million)
3.15  The project would focus on the key factors which influence educational quality,
instructional materials and teachers. It would thus: (a) provide books and supplementary
materials including materials in minority languages; (b) provide inservice training to



- 29 -
trainers, principals, underqualified teachers and training in specialty areas such as
multigrade teaching and bilingual education; (c) improve classroom teaching-learning
processes through an innovative Teacher Services Network; (d) strengthen the capacity of
Normal Schools to modernize primary level teacher training programs; and (e) support
dissemination activities aimed at systematic analysis, documentation, and application of
innovative strategies in the areas of education for girls and minorities.
3.16 Books and Supplementary Materials. Some 14 million copies of books for
libraries estimated to cost Y 37 million will be provided. For primary schools, the
number of books per child will increase from 3 in 1995 to between 5 and 6 in 2002. For
junior secondary schools, the number of books per pupil will double from 5 in 1995 to 10
in 2002. These will include materials in minority languages for minority pupils,
reflecting local cultures as appropriate. The training of library teachers would be
supported to improve the utilization of books as instructional resources as well as
management and utilization of libraries.
3.17  Staff Upgrading. An extensive program of staff training, largely through in-
country programs, will benefit about 65,000 teachers. Staff will follow training programs
for upgrading academic qualifications, specialty certification, multigrade teaching,
bilingual teaching, science teaching, laboratory technician training, librarianship,
continuous education and for improving principals school management skills. (See
Annex 11.) Training will be carried out through long-term and short-term inservice
courses which will develop appropriate structures to reach out to the poorest and most
remote schools. Training programs will focus both on upgrading content and teaching
methodology, focusing particularly on practical classroom skills appropriate for rural
schools in sparsely populated areas such as multigrade teaching techniques. In minority
areas, attention will be given to provision of training in bilingual education. All
programs are part of the provincial training programs which are in place. Terms of
Reference (TORs) for project-related training programs have been reviewed by the
Association and found acceptable.
3.18  At the junior secondary level, the project will support an innovative teacher
training program in science teaching, focusing on the training of trainers mechanism.
The focus of training programs will be new approaches to science teaching which
incorporate better understanding of contemporary and local issues such as environmental
protection, nutrition, and health care (see Annex 12).
3.19 Teacher Services Network Pilot (TSN). The objective of the TSN is to develop
professional consultative services and an enabling work environment which would
support village level, school-based activities aimed at improving access to a variety of
pedagogical practices and at responding speedily to rural teachers' problems and
difficulties (Annex13). With the establishment of TSNs, teachers in village primary
schools and teaching points will be less professionally isolated, have access to more
professional reading and instructional material, and have opportunities for more frequent
peer group interaction. Selected Town Central Primary Schools will become designated



- 30 -
"hubs" of the Network. These will be supported with the provision of additional
professional staff, equipment, reference books and adequate space where TSN materials
will be accommodated and routine activities carried out. Teachers in minority areas will
have the opportunity to develop locally-relevant teaching materials and experiment with
teaching approaches which utilize local human and material resources.
3.20  The TSN will be piloted in 10 counties8 during the project period, using structures
and organizational arrangements agreed between PEdCs, participating county education
bureaus, principals and staff of Central Primary Schools, and teacher representatives from
village schools and teaching points. Normal School Curriculum Review Groups will
oversee the professional activities while ensuring that awareness of TSN objectives,
organization, functions and activities is included in the Normal School final year
syllabus. Prior to launching the Network, counties will undertake a needs assessment
survey at village school level in order to identify and prioritize village teachers'
immediate skill needs. The program for the first year will be designed on the basis of
survey findings. A designated member of the CEP with teacher training experience will
assist FILO in monitoring TSN activities and these will be evaluated during the Mid-
Term Review. Performance monitoring indicators, specific to this activity and agreed
between the SEdC and PEdCs, are also set out in Annex 13.
3.21   Normal Schools ($7.63 million). Normal schools train teachers for the nation's
primary schools through pre-service and in-service programs. The National Program
portion of the project will finance staff upgrading programs, equipment and book
purchase (Annexi14). All provincial proposals affirmed the crucial role a qualitatively
improved normal school training system would play in assisting efforts to achieve NYCE
and raising teaching quality and school efficiency (Annax15). The policy of graduates
returming to their home villages will ensure that project benefits will remain in the
villages. As a direct result of the component, benefits will also accrue to nonproject
counties since normal schools, which are generally under prefectural jurisdiction, serve
both project and nonproject counties. The project component, receiving about 7 percent
of Credit proceeds, would support 46 normal schools which include 12 minority normal
schools, a primary school teacher training and research center in Hainan and a
broadcasting normal school in Guizhou. About 40 percent of student enrollment in 1995
were minorities of which about 43 percent were girls. Two hundred and seventeen
principals and 3,094 teachers would have completed staff upgrading programs
(Annex16).
3.22 Dissemination Program. This sub-component will document, disseminate and
apply effective and innovative educational experiments and successful experiences in the
areas of minorities' and girls' education with the aim of overcoming some of the existing
8 The Bank is also benefiting some twenty schools in the TSN through a parallel, independently-funded
activity which seeks to demonstrate the use of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems to provide power to
unelectrified schools.



- 31 -
educational problems in projected-supported counties. Activities will include those
carried out by local, national and international institutions and agencies which have
worked locally. Examples of these include the success which skills development
programs have had in some areas in retaining girls at junior secondary level; and the
success of some bilingual education programs in meeting the aspirations of minority
parents for their children's school experiences. Draft plans for the program will be drawn
up by project provinces in consultation with County Education Bureaus and Village
Committees (on which members of the community and parents are represented) for
review and approval by the CEP and SEdC. The program will be implemented by the
schools and township/County Education Bureaus, supervised by the PEdC, CEP, SEdC
and IDA supervision missions. The CEP will provide advice on the dissemination
programs, and assist FILO in monitoring their progress and reporting on their
implementation (Annex1).
Education Management Improvement Component (Base Cost $1.10 million)
3.23  In order to increase overall efficiency, enlarge the capacity of the administrative
system to achieve NYCE, and implement and monitor both parts of the proposed project,
this centrally-managed component (see Annex 18) would include: (a) national-level
management training for provincial trainers, education managers and administrators, and
project implementation staff; (b) centrally-organized seminars and workshops in support
of various project components, including the organization of overseas study tours;
(c) support for the Chinese Experts Panel which will assist FILO/SEdC in the monitoring
of the project; and (d) the improvement of management and utilization of EMIS to
strengthen project implementation and overall education administration.  Training
programs will be conducted by 48 Chinese experts and four foreign experts.
3.24 By 2002, the SEdC would have provided national-level project-related training for
managers. The content and approaches in all programs will address problems prevalent
in remote, rural, poor, and minority areas. Training of provincial-level staff will be
provided at the national level. Provinces will provide training for all staff below the
provincial level. The planning and management capacity of provincial, prefecture,
counties and township level education offices will be enhanced through extensive
training, largely in-country, by local experts. Training workshops and seminars will be
conducted for: (a) staff responsible for project management; (b) educational managers,
planners and professional personnel; and (c) include seminars designed to address the
quality enhancement component of the project.
3.25  Project Management. Project implementation capacity in each participating
county will be strengthened through training workshops for project management staff in
modern techniques of project management encompassing planning and execution of civil
works and procurement of equipment and books; project accounting and disbursement of
Credit and counterpart funds; and project monitoring and evaluation. Special emphasis
will be given to financial planning and management and the importance of keeping
financial accounts in step with project implementation. The training will take into



- 32 -
consideration provincial experience in the three earlier basic education projects as well as
other IDA-supported education projects. Each province has established a project steering
committee and working group to train county staff, and developed an appropriate training
program including planning of provincial and inter-provincial workshops and the hiring
of local specialist services.
3.26 Education Sector Management. Administrators at the provincial level will
participate in extensive in-country training in education planning and administration, with
special emphasis on: (a) educational financing and financial and human resource
mobilization and utilization; and (b) strategies for improving access and equity in
education, and raising the quality and efficiency of schooling. Special subjects will be
the Teacher Services Network (TSN) and the Educational Management Information
(EMIS) to widen the administrators' understanding of their purpose and function as
facilitators of education sector management. The training is aimed at fostering the
capacity for developing problem solving skills within the local context and formulating
policies to promote and sustain education and human resource development. When the
provincial administrators complete their training, they will, in turn, conduct training
programs for county, township and village personnel. The programs will include
workshops on all the subject areas the provincial administrators have learned, and
specialized training sessions for normal school principals and laboratory directors.
3.27 Educational Management Information System. The successful implementation
and operation of an EMIS will help the implementation of both parts of the project and
provide the logistical support for effective management of the education sector in general,
and primary and secondary education in particular.  The project will support the
establishment of EMIS in each project province and county education office for
management of primary and secondary schools. Where EMIS has been started, as in
Guizhou, Hunan, Shanxi and Yunnan under the EDPP project, and in Hainan and
Heilongjiang under the ETS project, this project will reinforce the system with the
appropriate staff training and/or supplementary equipment. The initial investment will
include the provision of equipment, software, and staff training. The State Research
Center of Computer Education for Primary and Secondary Schools under the aegis of the
SEdC will identify experts to conduct training sessions for approximately 200 designated
personnel in 1997 and 1998, in time for the component to have some impact during the
project period (Annex 18).
3.28 Seminars and Study Tours. A number of seminars and study tours have been
planned by SEdC to support project activities and project-related training workshops.
Seminars will include those which provide opportunities for exchanging experiences for
staff involved in the establishment of the TSN; sessions on girls' education, minorities'
education, seminars in project fields specially designed for principals of primary and
junior secondary schools; and quality issues in teacher training. Overseas study tours will
focus on gaining international perspectives on continuous, post-qualification teacher
support; educational planning, finance and management; project management; and
increasing efficiency of schools.



- 33 -
3.29 Chinese Experts Panel (CEP). A CEP has been established under the aegis of
the SEdC to provide ongoing guidance and services to SEdC and the provinces on project
implementation and policy issues (AnnexIl9). The CEP will serve the needs of both the
National Program and the Qinba Village Primary Education Program. In particular, the
CEP will assist FILO/SEdC monitor and evaluate the student assistance program
administered by the provinces, the TSN and Dissemination Program activities; follow up
and evaluate the pilot Textbook Rental Scheme; monitor the progress of the normal
school component; and provide professional guidance on all technical assistance
activities. The participation of some CEP members in pre-appraisal and appraisal bodes
well for the project as it helps to bring preparation and implementation activities together,
thereby assuring effective execution of the project.
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION-QINBA VILLAGE PRIMARY EDUCATION PROGRAM
(QVPEP)
3.30 The QVPEP would facilitate the development of locally funded and managed
education systems for the absolute poor at the village level in the counties and townships
which are part of the Qinba Mountain Poverty Reduction Project. The QVPEP would
address low educational attainment among the poor in the Qinba project areas by
enhancing the delivery of primary education through: (a) renovation and construction of
school buildings and facilities, (b) provision of student assistance for poor students,
(c) provision of textbooks, instructional equipment and furniture, and (d) teacher and
management training. Due to the disproportionately low levels of female enrollment and
retention in the project area, the project's target of five or six-year UBE strongly favors
girls' education. The QVPEP program concentrates investment in village level basic
infrastructure, upgrading the quality and reliability of services, and the development of
mechanisms to insure access to educational services by the absolute poor. The QVPEP
program includes mechanisms to ensure project sustainability and funding for student
assistance.
Access to Nine Year Compulsory Education Component (Base Cost $21.03 million)
3.31 Civil Works (Base Costs $13.81 million). The QVPEP will finance civil works
for primary schools based on SEdC and/or Provincial space planning and construction
guidelines. The scope of works for the three QVPEP provinces will include: (a) repairs to
existing structures which are in poor physical condition with an estimated cost of Y 2.04
million for some 13,500 m2; (b) replacement of dangerous structures with an estimated
cost of Y 33.9 million for some 83,900 mi2; and (c) construction of new schools in
underserved counties on existing property for which no new acquisition will be required
and expansion of existing schools through additional classrooms, laboratories and
libraries at an estimated cost of Y 76.9 million for 188,800 mi (Annex 2Q).
3.32 Equipment, Furniture and Books (Base Costs $4.24 million). The primary
schools under the QVPEP will have their schools improved through the provision of
equipment, library books, desks and chairs, and a limited amount of furniture for



- 34 -
laboratories. Most schools will use project funds to purchase "3rd class equipment"
which is the minimum SEdC national standard for school equipment. This will allow the
schools to offer the minimum level of SEdC required experiments as outline by the
national curriculum for primary school science. Library books per student will be
increased from approximately 5 to 8 in Sichuan, 4 to 10 in Shaanxi and 3 to 5 in Ningxia.
New desks and chairs purchased under the project will, by the end of the project, provide
100 percent of the needed furniture for project schools (Annex.2Q).
3.33   Student Assistance (Base Costs $3.05 million). Approximately 57,000 students
in the project areas will be supported for the five years of the project by both current,
ongoing government and non-government financing schemes as well as project
counterpart funding. These 57,000 students can be divided into two groups of school-age
children requiring financial assistance: approximately 23,000 poor students currently
receiving financial assistance who would drop out of school if financial assistance were
not available; and approximately 34,000 out-of-school children who are not in school
because of poverty. A number of channels are already well established for providing
financial assistance for the first group of students. The channels include financial
allocations from central, provincial, prefecture, and county governments, work-study
programs in primary schools, Hope Foundation, the Spring Bud Program, and other
sources. However, government allocations constitute the major source for supporting
existing poor students.
3.34 Assuming support of Y 50 per student per year, the total aggregate funding
needed, agreed and committed by SEdC on behalf of itself and the three QVPEP
provinces is approximately Y 24.8 million ($3.0 million). This includes current ongoing
funding which is guaranteed to be continued through the five years of the project, and
both direct funding and interest from education funds9 interest necessary to support new
students who are currently not enrolled in school.
3.35 The levels of support needed and confirmed by each project province to keep
currently enrolled students in school and bring those not currently enrolled into the school
system, by province, are:
9 Education funds generate interest income on deposits initially from government and eventually from
non-government sources. Controlled and supervised by Provincial govemments. The initial deposit of
funds for the foundation is provided by the Provincial Education Commissions from their education
budgets.

Levels of support for each child will depend on actual need and be based on levels of
family rural per capita income. The scope of support for individual students will range
from partial subsidy of textbooks to full payment of textbook and all schooling fees plus
partial expenses (including food) in boarding schools, or from roughly Y 20 to 120 a
year.
3.36  Direct funding of all new students during the first year and a portion of those
students in year two through five is acknowledged by the SEdC as necessary in order to
support students until the interest income of the education funds begins to come in the
second year, and to keep the size of the initial deposit into the educational funds
manageable and feasible. Direct funding of all students currently out of school for
economic reasons will be necessary in year one of the student assistance scheme because
interest income from the educational funds will not yet be available. In year two through
year five a combination of direct funding and indirect funding from interest income on
education funds (see para. 3.38). The levels of this direct student assistance funding has
been assured and will be confirmed at negotiations.
3.37   Educational funds will be established in the three provinces in order to provide
partial indirect interest-supported funding for the students currently out of school. The
following initial deposits will have to be made in order to generate, at a prospective 8.0
percent interest rate, sufficient income to allow for the support of the target number of
students. The estimated levels of investment in the funds are as follows:
Province                           Level of Investment

Sichuan                                           8,500,000
0 Fund investment is the amount of money which must be invested at the establishment of the fund in
order to provide adequate funding for a sufficient number of students for years two through five of the
project using a unit cost of Y 50 per student to be supported.



- 36 -
3.38  Administration and monitoring of the student assistance program are critical
and will follow recommendations made by Yunnan Province (on selection criteria and
targeting poor children for receipt of support according to levels of rural per capita
income) and Shaanxi Province (on the administration of the student assistance process).
School principals and classroom teachers will be able to nominate children, both those
about ready to go to school and those in school, for support. Reporting of all expenses in
the scheme will be done annually. The CEP will monitor the implementation of the
student assistance program on an annual basis and report any irregularities to the
provinces, the SEdC and the Bank. In addition, an appropriate level of provincial control
of the educational funds is an important principle of administration and will be required
by the project. (See Annex 21 for details of the management of the student assistance
program.) The borrower provided the Bank at negotiations, for review and approval,
draft administrative guidelines for the program based on the procedures developed by
both provinces.
3.39  The student assistance programs for the QVPEP component of the overall project
is of major importance to the project goal of providing quality education to the absolute
poor. Without student assistance to both bring currently non-enrolled children into
school and keep currently enrolled students in school, approximately 57,000 children, or
12 percent of the school age children in the project area might not be able to have access
to primary education. Recognizing the substantial impact of poverty on the enrollment
patterns of children in the 26 very poor QVPEP counties, the three project provinces and
the SEdC have allocated $3.0 million of the counterpart funds to support the student
assistance program. This is approximately 20 percent of overall counterpart funding for
the QVPEP and substantially higher than the projected 3.3 percent of counterpart funding
for student assistance in the National Program. Therefore, recognizing the importance of
the QVPEP Student Assistance Program in ensuring increased enrollments of children
from families of the absolute poor, the different sources of funding necessary for both the
direct and indirect funding of the Programn, and the large initial amounts of funding
critical to provide student assistance during the first year of the project, both direct
funding and for the initial deposits in the educational fund, the establishment of the
student assistance programs acceptable to IDA for the three project provinces with the
full initial deposits described in paragraph 3.35 will be a condition of project
effectiveness.
Education Quality Enhancement Component (Base Costs $1.35 million)
3.40  Teacher Training. Teacher training under the project will upgrade the skill level
of unqualified teachers and minban teachers as well as provide continuing education for
qualified teachers. The training activities will give teachers new professional skills as
well as provide them with the opportunity to interact with colleagues in the teaching
profession. Through improved teacher knowledge acquired during the training activities,
the project area villages and townships will experience better quality of education.
Training institutions at all levels have been operating effectively and there is no
foreseeable problem with the training capacity in the provinces and counties. Under the



- 37 -
project the teacher training activities will include: academic qualification training;
multigrade teaching training, laboratory teacher training, librarian training, and
continuous education. Each Province has prepared draft Terms of Reference for their
teacher training activities taking into consideration an appropriate balance between
teaching methodology and subject matter. Upon completion of the project it is expected
that the qualification rate for teachers in the project areas will increase to 94.8 percent for
Sichuan, 95.5 percent for Ningxia, and 90 percent for Shaanxi.
Education Management Improvement Component (Base Costs $0.10 million)
3.41  Management Training. Management capacity is essential to the implementation
of the proposed project. To improve the capacity of the administrative system in
monitoring and implementing the project, the project has included a management training
component. Project management training for provincial education staff will be provided
at the national level by the SEdC. Upon completion of the national level training, the
PEdC will provide management training to the Directors of the project county education
bureaus. The Foreign Investment and Loan Office (FILO) of the SEdC will also conduct
training for provincial and pilot county staff who are in charge of civil works,
procurement, financing and project management.
Environmental Aspects and Program Objective Categories
3.42  No negative environmental impact from  the project is anticipated.  No
resettlement or land acquisition is foreseen in that all new civil works will be
construction, extension, rehabilitation or repair of schools on existing school sites.
Improved access to and quality of basic education will enhance the ability of the poor to
take advantage of the opportunities presented by economic growth, either in their own
counties or areas of faster economic development. Improved overall access to education
will increase girl's enrollments. The project, through its targeted training programs, will
increase the numbers of women teachers and principals and thus encourage enrollment
and retention of girls in schools. It has been shown that improved quality of education in
general also increases the retention of girls, with resultant economic and social benefits.
Special attention has been paid, through a participatory process, to design the project so
as to ensure that the minority beneficiaries fully benefit from the project, in accordance
with the requirements of the Bank Group's Operational Directive 4.20. (See paras.
2.24-2.32.)
3.43  Community participation in the design of the project, especially in minority areas,
was a key element of project preparation. Village Committees in which parents are active
participants have been and will continue to be important in supporting many school
activities including school construction and repairs, payment of minban teachers and
sometimes accommodation of teachers, ensuring that all children enroll in school, and
introduction of local content in local curriculum. Local community participation during
project implementation will occur by direct and indirect means. Direct participation can
be seen in parental participation in school meetings, usually two or three times a term, to



- 38 -
discuss their children's school work and their cocurricular activities at school. Teachers
also make several visits each term to discuss with parents their children's study program
and their performance in school, providing parents with another opportunity to provided
an input into their children's learning. It will be important for Village Committees to
continue to function during the life of the project and contribute to the success of project
implementation. Both SEdC and the CEP should, on their regular site visits, meet with
the Committees to ensure their continued contribution to school level project
implementation. (See para. 4.6.)
D. PROJECT COSTS
3.44 National Program (NP). The project cost for the National Program is estimated
at $136.67 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of $15.20 million
equivalent, excluding taxes and duties. Project costs are summarized by component in
Table 3.1 and by category in Table 3.2. (See Annex 22 for detailed tables.)
3.45 Qinba Village Primary Education Program (QVPEP). The project cost of the
Qinba Village Primary Education Program is estimated at $28.53 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of $4.01 million equivalent, excluding taxes and duties.
Project costs are summarized by component in Table 3.4 and by category in Table 3.5.
(See Annex 23 for detailed tables.)
3.46  Unit Costs. Base costs for both programs are expressed in June 1996 prices.
Civil works costs are based on construction of similar schools in 14 pilot counties in
1995. Costs of equipment, books and materials are based on contracts for similar items
awarded recently. Technical assistance costs for internationally recruited experts include
costs of salaries, allowances and airfares, and are based on 1995 SEdC experience.
Technical assistance costs for local training are based on spring 1996 actual costs
provided by SEdC.
3.47 Contingency allowances have been estimated as follows. For local expenditures,
8.5 percent for 1997, 7.0 percent for 1998, 6.5 percent for 1999, and 6.2 percent
thereafter; and for foreign expenditures, 2.5 percent for 1997-2003.
E. FINANCING PLAN
3.48 National Program (NP). IDA will finance $70 million equivalent, and the
provinces, local municipalities and counties $66.6 million. The Credit will cover all the
foreign exchange requirements and about 78 percent of local costs. The financing plan is
given in Table 3.3. The proposed Credit will be made available by MOF to the project
provinces at an annual interest rate of 1.2 percent or less. The provincial governments'
debt service obligation for the total Credit will be negligible. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained from the Borrower that it will make a part of the proceeds of
the Credit available to all nine Project Provinces (including Q VPEP) for their Education
Programs on the following terms: repayment over 17 years (with 5 years grace), interest
at 1.2 percent per year or less. The provincial governments will bear the foreign



- 39-
exchange risks on those proceeds. Each project province will allocate the Credit
proceeds to its counties, as far as possible on a grant basis, otherwise on terms at least
as favorable as those terms on which the province receives the funds from the central
government.
3.49 Qinba ViUlage Primary Education Program (QVPEP). IDA will finance
$15 million equivalent, and the provinces, local municipalities and counties
$13.53 million. The Credit will cover all the foreign exchange requirements and about 73
percent of local costs. The financing plan is given in Table 3.6. The proposed Credit will
be made available by MOF to the project provinces at an annual interest rate of 1.2
percent or less. The provincial governments' debt service obligation for the total Credit
will be negligible.

F. SUSTAINABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY
3.50  The project will partially finance school-based activities at the village, township,
county and provincial level, and SEdC activities which are embedded within, and support
the key national education policy of achieving universal 9-year education by the year
2000. In addition, the project will cover a small number of normal schools. The
moderate level of IDA financing for the project (approximately 50 percent) and the
annual levels of counterpart funding necessary for the project as a ratio of the actual 1995
provincial and county education budgets (0.89 and 3.3 percent, respectively, on average)
increase both the chances for sustainability and affordability of the project activities.
Additionally, the source of provincial counterpart funding is balanced and sustainable-
on average approximately 35 percent from the county and 65 percent from the province
and prefecture level. Likewise, the poverty reduction focus of the project is central to the
Government's 7-year plan to eliminate absolute poverty by the year 2000, a plan that
specifically aims at upgrading education and literacy in backward and poor areas. Built
into the project are maintenance costs for schools, classrooms and equipment procured
under the project, equipment procurement, technical assistance and training to develop a
planning-enhancing MIS system. The training of approximately 130,000 teachers and
school managers builds and strengthens existing and new human resource capacity which
will remain in place after the implementation of the project. (See Anne   I for detailed
data.)
3.51 The financial sustainability of the project is assessed by comparing the projected
total recurrent costs of compulsory education in project counties in 2002 with the
projected recurrent budgets for compulsory education in these counties in that year. (See
Annex 24 for detailed Economic and Financial Analysis.) Total recurrent cost in 2002 is
the sum of the total regular recurrent costs of personnel and nonpersonnel inputs in 2002
and the total annual recurrent cost implication of the project. The total annual recurrent
costs implication of the project is equal to the sum of the annual costs needed to maintain
the effectiveness of project investments in school buildings, equipment, furniture, and
technical assistance. In this analysis, the annual costs of maintenance of an education
input is estimated to be the product of a coefficient for that input and the project
investment in that input. The coefficient will vary across education inputs and across
project counties. It is between 2 and 3 percent for school buildings, between 3 and 4
percent for equipment, between 1 and 2 percent for furniture, and between 0.1 and
0.3 percent for technical assistance. The projected recurrent budgets in 2002 were
estimated on the basis of the actual recurrent expenditure in 1995 and a historical growth
rate.
3.52  The final results of the analysis are incorporated in the revised feasibility reports
prepared by the provincial representatives. The total annual recurrent cost implications of
the project investment have been found to be a small percentage of the projected 2002
total recurrent costs at the provincial level. The aggregate results for the project counties
are given in Annex 25. The project-related recurrent costs to be borne by the project
counties are expected to be manageable.

4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. MANAGEMENT OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
4.1   National Level Implementation. Both the National Program (NP) and the Qinba
Village Primary Education Program (QVPEP) will use the same implementation structure
and mechanisms (Annexes 26 and 27). SEdC, through the Education Management
Component, will implement national level project activities in which each province has a
shared involvement (see para. 3.24-3.30). These activities will include: (a) national-level
management training for provincial trainers, education managers and administrators, and
project implementation staff; (b) centrally-organized seminars and workshops in support
of various project components, including the organization of overseas study tours;
(c) support for the Chinese Experts Panel which will assist FILO/SEdC in the monitoring
of the project; and (d) monitoring and evaluation, largely through the preparation of
evaluative reports, which will include management and utilization of EMIS to strengthen
administration and implementation. To expedite implementation of centrally-managed
activities, MOF will provide a one-time approval of the activities which have been agreed
with provinces during project preparation. MOF will release allocated budget funds in
tranches. FILO, with the assistance of appropriate technical departments of SEdC, such
as teacher training, and the administrative resources used satisfactorily in past projects,
will monitor and supervise the project's implementation goals. FILO will make
supplementary changes in management of the project when necessary, keeping IDA
informed about these changes.
4.2   The SEdC's responsibilities in project implementation would be increased under
this project, in view of its growing capabilities and experience with IDA-financed
operations. Specifically, SEdC will assume responsibility for:
(a)   carrying out national level training activities (including a limited number
of overseas training programs and study tours) in accordance with an
action plan acceptable to the Association;
(b)   coordination and oversight of project implementation carried out at the
national, provincial, prefectural and county levels;
(c)   review of goods and works procurement procedures to make sure they are
being carried out in accordance with the Development Credit Agreement
(DCA). This will include pre-screening procurement procedures and
arranging for joint procurement where appropriate.
(d)   carrying out periodic supervision, jointly with provincial authorities, of
action plan implementation at the provincial, prefectural and county levels.



-46 -
This will entail review meetings at the provincial level and site visits to
selected project counties; and
(e)   preparation of a Mid-Term report by June 30, 2000, and implementation
completion report in a format agreeable to the Association.
Assurances were sought at negotiations that a national level Project Implementation
Office (in FILO), reporting to a Vice Minister of SEdC, will be maintained throughout the
duration of the project, with terms of reference, staff members and resources acceptable
to the Association. The Education Management Improvement component will be carried
out in accordance with a program acceptable to IDA and to this effect the Borrower will
prepare and furnish to IDA, not later than October 31 each year, a proposed action plan
for implementation of the component during the following year and thereafter implement
this annual plan, as approved by IDA. The provincial and national action plans for the
first year of implementation were reviewed and cleared at negotiations.
4.3   Provincial Level Implementation. The actual implementation of the project will
take place at county-level in the provinces. However, the major management and
coordination of county project activities will be the responsibility of PEdCs under the
guidance of FILO/SEdC. Before implementation gets underway, a project launch
workshop would be carried out. SEdC will be responsible for national-level activities in
which provinces will be participants. At the provincial level, Foreign Investment and
Loan Offices have been formed, headed by the Deputy Directors of the respective PEdCs,
and staffed with officials experienced in education planning and management, financial
management and accounting, civil works and equipment. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that Provinces will maintain project offices with responsibility to coordinate
project implementation, with TORs, technical/professional staff and resources
acceptable to IDA.
4.4   Education Programs (see para. 3.5) are those activities that have been reviewed,
appraised and found acceptable by IDA as project-supported activities. As a condition of
participating in the Project, each province would enter into Education Program
Implementation Agreements (EPIAs), consisting of the arrangements to ensure the proper
implementation of the Education Programs, with the Borrower, through the PEdC. All
nine provinces have prepared and furnished to the Borrower action plans, acceptable to
the Association, for the first year of implementation. Action plans would provide
detailed information on implementation planned for all the project components. As a
condition of effectiveness the Borrower will provide the Association with provincial
Education Program Implementation Agreements, acceptable to the Association, made
between the Borrower and each of the nine project provinces for carrying out the
provinces' Education Programs. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
provinces will furnish annual provincial action plans to IDA by October 31 each year,
and thereafter carry out the plans as approved by the Borrower and IDA. The action
plans will include the following year's civil works plan, maintenance plan, staff training



- 47 -
plan and a program to ensure participation of village committees in the implementation
of the project.
4.5   County Level Implementation. While the management of implementation in
project counties is the responsibility of the PEdCs, actual implementation will be the
responsibility of the County Education Bureaus. All project civil works, for example,
will be carried out at the county level, in townships and rural villages. Training for
county level project implementation staff will be organized by the PEdC. County-level
project implementation offices (or county-level FILOs) will replicate those at the
provincial level. The establishment of such offices should be a condition of participation
in the Project and thus would be a prerequisite for concluding EPIAs with each province.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that provinces will ensure that County
Education Bureaus will maintain project offices with TORs, staffing and resources
acceptable to the Association throughout the project implementation period
4.6   The Chinese Experts Panel (CEP). The CEP has been organized by SEdC to
assist in the implementation of the project at the national, provincial and county levels.
The Panel, comprising representatives from the Government, educational research units
and universities, will report to FILO/SEdC. The chief functions of the Panel are to assist
FILO/SEdC in: (a) advising provinces and counties on the development of education
plans; (b) advising on the development and implementation of staff training activities,
both in country and overseas; (c) periodically monitoring implementation progress by
reviewing project indicators and the participation of Village Committees in the
monitoring of locally relevant curricula; (d) assisting FILO in monitoring the educational
achievement targets for the project provinces' nonproject supported counties;
(e) monitoring the implementation of innovative strategies and pilot activities including
the student assistance program, the teacher service network, the dissemination program
and the textbook rental scheme; and (f) providing an evaluative report at Mid-Term. The
role and responsibilities of the CEP are elaborated in Annex 19. In order to ensure the
proper carrying out of the Project, assurances were obtained that the Borrower would
maintain throughout the period of Project implementation, with terms of reference,
membership and other resources acceptable to the Association, a CEP with responsibility
for providing technical advice to project Provinces on the development and
implementation of their Education Programs and to SEdC on the development and
implementation of training programs and the monitoring of overall activities.
B. MONITORING, REPORTING AND SUPERVISION
4.7   Monitoring and Evaluation. The project includes activities and processes aimed
at strengthening national, provincial and local monitoring evaluation capacity. While
FILO/SEdC has overall responsibility for monitoring and evaluation (M&E), its
effectiveness will depend on the cooperative contribution made by every provincial and
county/municipal implementing agency. At provincial, prefecture and county levels, the
project will include personnel training linked with the establishment or upgrading of
Educational Management Information Systems (EMIS). Efforts will be made to assist



- 48 -
provincial and county levels in organizing data collection and analysis in order to monitor
and evaluate project implementation as well as local level M&E capabilities in general.
4.8   Performance Monitoring Indicators and Implementation Targets. Project
performance indicators have been identified by provinces working together with counties
and SEdC for primary, junior secondary and for normal schools. These will be used to
track the implementation progress of project activities as they move toward their targets.
The comprehensive range of detailed indicators selected per province reflects the
commitment of stakeholders and beneficiaries to project objectives and mirrors their
involvement in project design. Data on indicators will be available for every participating
school will be collected biennially for the years 1998, 2000 and 2002 (base year data for
1995 have been provided). The table format would provide an important tool for
operating the EMIS. Data from the provincial-level consolidated table should provide all
the basic information required for updating the Annual Action Plan, preparation of the
Annual Progress Report, the Mid-Term Review, the Implementation Completion Report,
and any post-implementation impact evaluation study. (See Annex 28 for mid-term
review scope and content.)
4.9   Central to project monitoring and supervision is the reporting mechanism which
will be reflected in the EPIAs. At the various levels, reports would provide, in a
systematic fashion, essential information on implementation of project components.
Project schools will report to County Education Bureaus which will analyze and
consolidate school level data for the county level Annual Progress Report (APR) which
will be submitted to the provincial FILO. Apart from the data, descriptive analyses of
project implementation will be provided by PEdCs. These would capture disparities in
project implementation and performance, providing signals for possible remedial action.
FILO/PEdCs will similarly analyze all county reports to present a consolidated APR to
FILO/SEdC. FILO/SEdC then will analyze and submit to IDA, by April 1 annually, a
national APR based on the provincial reports, providing a national perspective on project
achievements. Normal schools will provide individual institutional APRs directly to
provincial FILOs which will include these in their APRs to FILO/SEdC. The reports will
be based on the implementation targets and project activities identified in the Action
Plans by county, province and SEdC, with progress evaluated and monitored on the
indicators found acceptable to IDA, SEdC, provinces and counties. Additional sources of
information for the reports would include: annual reports from the CEP; FILO/PEdC
supervision reports; and, particularly in the latter years of the project, data from the
computerized EMIS. All implementing entities will use reporting formats reviewed and
approved at appraisal. The flow of communication should travel in both directions: all
implementing agencies and institutions should receive copies of the final report from
FILO/SEdC to provide a project-wide perspective on activities and achievements.
4.10 The APRs will be the main sources of information for the Mid-Term report to be
prepared by FILO/SEdC, assisted by the CEP, and should reach IDA at a specified time
before the Mid-Term Review meeting. The APRs will provide the necessary quantitative
information and the qualitative evaluation for the preparation of the Implementation



- 49 -
Completion Report (ICR), the joint responsibility of FILO/SEdC and the Association,
when the project is completed.
4.11  Supervision. The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2002, and will
be implemented over a five-year period, plus six months for the completion of payments
and full withdrawal of Credit proceeds. The Credit is thus expected to close by
December 31, 2002.
4.12  During project implementation, periodic missions from the Association will
review the progress of project implementation, according to a Supervision Plan
(Annex 29) and based on indicators presented in Annex 8, respectively. SEdC/FILO,
with the assistance of the Chinese Experts Panel, will monitor progress on a province by
province basis using indicators agreed for each province.
4.13  Each year, IDA and the SEdC will jointly review the progress toward completion
of the annual action plans and approve the following year's annual action plan. Annual
reports on the progress of project implementation will be prepared by FILO, beginning
April 1, 1998, based on information received from review meetings, operational units and
agencies of the project. These reports will give special attention to the development of
the EMIS, teacher training activities, and the dissemination program. A Mid-Term
review will take place prior to and FILO will produce a Mid-Term report by June 30,
2000. A project implementation 'completion report will be prepared by FILO and
submitted to the Association within six months of the closing of the project Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that: (a) using data provided by PEdCs by March 1, the
Borrower through SEdC will monitor and evaluate project progress on the basis of
indicators acceptable to the Association, andfurnish the Association the results of such
reviews by April I of each year; (b) a mid-term report will be prepared by FILO by
June 30, 2000; and (c) a project implementation completion report (ICR) will be
prepared by FILO and submitted to the Association within six months of the closing date.
C. PROCUREMENT
4.14 The Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits,
dated January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, will govern the procurement
of goods and works under the project. In addition, the "Model Bidding Documents"
prepared by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with the Bank will be used for all
procurement under the project. Procurement arrangements are presented for the National
Program and for the Qinba Village Primary Education Program in Table 4.1.
4.15 Civil Works ($101.4 million). This includes new construction as well as major
and minor repairs of school buildings. Most of the schools are in small villages or
dispersed rural areas in remote locations with construction spread over time resulting in
high mobilization cost for foreign contractors and therefore it is unlikely that foreign
contractors will be interested in bidding. New construction and major repairs costing
$100,000 or more each will be awarded through National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
under procedures acceptable to the Association. Small works contracts costing less than



- 50 -
$100,000 up to an aggregate not to exceed $60 million equivalent will be obtained on the
basis of quotations from three qualified bidders and awards will be based on the lowest
qualified bid. Minor repairs and works may be carried out through force account up to an
aggregate of $25,500,000 with the Association's prior agreement. Suitable safeguards for
cost control and payment against performance will be incorporated and construction will
be coordinated by County Construction Bureaus and supervised by the Provincial
Construction Bureaus. Model bid documents prepared in China, in consultation with
IDA, will be used for NCB. Annual provincial civil works plans will be reviewed and
approved each year by IDA. The $25.5 million of works that will be carried out under
force account will be allocated by province by the Borrower and become Annex 30 of the
SAR. The procurement plans and an implementation plan are found in Annex 31.
4.16 Goods ($46.2 million). Experience with the implementation of earlier Bank
Group-supported basic education projects indicates that it is highly unlikely that
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be needed for procurement of goods
(classroom furniture and teaching equipment) for the project. However, should there be
equipment and materials procurement with contracts of $200,000 or above, they will be
awarded through ICB. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods shall be grouped
into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $200,000 or more each. If ICB is
used, local manufacturers would be eligible for a margin of preference in bid evaluation
of 15 percent or the prevailing rate of customs duty, whichever is lower. Contracts
estimated to cost under $200,000 for primary, junior secondary and normal school
equipment, furniture, and materials up to an aggregate amount not expected to exceed
$32 million, and all book contracts, will be awarded through NCB procedures acceptable
to the Association. NCB will be used for procurement of books (aggregate value of $9.1
million) following procedures developed in the three earlier basic education projects.
Books are selected by schools, county and provincial education authorities from a list
prepared by SEdC and published by competing provincial book companies.  Past
experience and review of book procurement contracts indicate that competition, based on
price, has been the main factor in the awarding of provincial contracts for books.
Equipment and materials contracts with an estimated value of less than $30,000 each and
an aggregate amount equivalent to $5.1 million for the project will be awarded under
shopping procedures after solicitation and evaluation of at least three written price
quotations.
4.17 Consultant Services and Training ($12.1 million). Teacher training will be
contracted by County Education Bureaus with Teacher Training Institutions. IDA will
finance expenditures of the trainees for all the training programs.  Studies (i.e.,
dissemination program and student financial assistance program), and domestic and
international consultants will be selected by the provinces with the assistance of the CEP
and FILO using the Bank Group's standard form of contract for consultants' services, and
following guidelines on the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers dated January 1997. As all consultants will be selected as individuals,
section 5 of the Consultant Guidelines will provide the basis for their selection and
employment. In the unlikely event the implementing agencies were to engage a firm,



- 51 -
they would follow Quality Based Selection procedures. The aggregate amount for
training activities is $10.0 million and consultant services is $2.10 million. Details on
staff-months and costs are in Annex 11.
4.18   Review of Project Procurement Procedures. Prior review by the Association of
all stages of the bidding process will be required for: (a) the first two proposed works
contracts from each province annually throughout the project and all works contracts
valued at or above $200,000; and (b) the first two equipment contracts let by each
province and thereafter, all goods contracts valued at or above $200,000.  NCB
procurement for equipment is expected to take place through one major exercise in each
province with an appropriate number of packages for schools and equipment kits level.
The PEdCs will compile all equipment and book lists based on SEdC approved
equipment lists. These lists will be reviewed by the Equipment Bureau and approved by
the FILO Director. With regard to the proposed works contracts for which the Bank
Groups' prior review is required, SEdC will review them to ensure compliance with the
Bank Groups' requirements. The Resident Mission in China will prescreen these
documents prior to forwarding the contracts to headquarters for its review. In view of the
social objective of the project and using parameters developed in the previoUs basic
education project, prior review coverage will be of approximately 11 to 13 percent of
goods contracts and 4 to 6 percent of works contracts. Prior review will be required for
all consultant contracts with firms valued at $100,000 or more and for all contracts with
individuals valued at $50,000 or more.

D. DISBURSEMENTS
4.19 The proposed IDA Credit for $85.0 million equivalent will be disbursed over a
period of 5 years as shown in Table 4.2 and Annex 32. The percentages of disbursement
for each expenditure category under the Credit are given in Table 4.2, and follow a
disbursement profile derived from earlier Bank Group experience in basic education and
teacher training projects, especially ones which contain a substantial amount of civil
works. Reimbursements will be based on full documentation except for: (a) training
programs; (b) contracts for works valued at less than $200,000 and goods valued at less
than $200,000 equivalent, except for the first two works contracts per province per year
and the first two goods contracts per province; and (c) contracts for consulting firms
valued at $100,000 equivalent or less and for individual consultants' contracts valued at
$50,000 equivalent or less, which will all be reimbursed on the basis of Statements of
Expenditure (SOEs). This SOE threshold has been established based on the good prior
experience with the implementing agency in the earlier three basic education projects and
the nature of the project. The provincial project units will be responsible for preparing
withdrawal applications. County project units will prepare withdrawal applications for
submission to the Provincial Project Unit, which will submit the withdrawal applications
to the Provincial Finance Bureaus who will forward them to the Ministry of Finance
(MOF). MOF will review the applications and submit them to the Association.
Documents supporting the SOEs will be retained by the MOF and made available for
information to SEdC and inspection by IDA supervision missions. Retroactive financing
of up to 10 percent of the Credit amount ($8.5 million equivalent) is recommended to
cover payments already made under the project starting from January 1, 1997 for training
activities and March 15, 1997 for civil works contracts.

established in a bank, and on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association. It will
be replenished monthly or whenever it is drawn down to half its initial deposit level,
whichever occurs first. Disbursements for staff training in China or study tours abroad
will be made from the Special Account against the actual cost of travel, subsistence and
training fees incurred.
4.21   Accounts and Audits. Provincial accounts will be maintained by the provincial
finance bureaus with reports submitted to the MOF. National project accounts and details
of the Special Account will be maintained by MOF. Annual audits will be performed by
independent auditors acceptable to the Association, and a consolidated audit report sent to
the Association. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that a consolidated annual
audit report of national and provincial project accounts and the Special Account would
be submitted to the Association within six months of the end of each Government fiscal
year, and that the audit will contain a separate opinion regarding the SOEs.

5. BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. BENEFITS
5.1   As a result of the project, coverage of basic education will provide better access to
schools and will benefit about 6.2 million poor children, who are the direct beneficiaries,
in some of China's poorer provinces. The civil works component will benefit 2,936
primary schools and 771 junior secondary schools. The project is expected to provide
243,000 new places for primary schools and 135,000 at the junior secondary level. It will
significantly expand basic education among the poor, especially in the remote areas
inhabited by minority nationalities. Targeted student assistance programs for children in
the very poorest counties, minorities and girls, will provide opportunities for a more
equitable utilization of development resources, while contributing to improved rates of
enrollment, transition from primary to junior secondary education, and completion for
primary and secondary schooling. An expanded, sustainable student assistance program,
focused on the poorest counties in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Ningxia, will be established.
Provision of education to remote and rural areas not only helps to create opportunities for
rural development but also provides local inhabitants the skills necessary to participate in
economic growth in township and urban centers. Almost all schools in project counties
will benefit from the project in some form.
5.2   The quality of primary and junior secondary schooling would be improved
through the training of teachers and principals, with targeted training for female
principals. The project will provide varying lengths of training for approximately
138,000 teachers, trainers and education managers. The Teacher Services Network
would be established as a sustainable, ongoing, local quality enhancement mechanism
imparting new teaching approaches and pedagogical methods, which respond directly to
teacher needs at the rural village school level. Innovative strategies and successful
experiences in the education for girls and minorities would be documented and
disseminated widely within and across provinces, reinforcing the impetus for better
quality in teaching of these target groups through greater awareness of issues and
strategies. Learning achievement indicators would indicate positive, incremental changes
in specified content areas in selected counties.
5.3   The education management system would be improved through specific training
interventions at county, province and national levels. The project support for the EMIS
and the reporting and feedback mechanism established to facilitate a two-way
communication flow would strengthen the system as a whole. Together with training
interventions, the improved management practices would have a spin-off effect on
nonproject counties as a direct result of the project.

B. RISKS
5.4   The tight fiscal situation in participating provinces and counties may result in
insufficient counterpart funding to match IDA credit funds. To reduce this risk, the
project preparation team has been working with provincial authorities to accurately
estimate and plan for counterpart funds, using both data from past years and future
projections to assess counterpart funding and the financial sustainability of the project.
Experience from implementation of the earlier basic education projects shows that the
county level provision of counterpart funding has not been a problem with civil works
targets, the component where the bulk of the counterpart money is being used and which
is likely to run ahead of project schedules. All nine project implementing agencies at the
national and provincial levels have demonstrated experience in handling these
responsibilities effectively in earlier projects.
5.5    The project's inclusion of nine provinces increases the risk of successful
implementation problems. However, the experience of all nine provinces in previous
projects provides them with a strong basis for effective implementation of the current
project. Additionally, in the three provinces of the QVPEP, 12 of the participating 26
counties are already implementing other IDA supported education projects, and their
experience enhances likelihood of successful implementation.
5.6    Critical to the success of the QVPEP is increasing the number of poor children
enrolled in schools which provide good quality education. A risk in the project is that the
proposed interventions will neither raise enrollments nor provide the necessary quality
education. Issues of poverty and quality of teaching have been recognized by the design
team by developing a special, poverty-focused student assistance program with funding
from counterpart sources, and with specific modalities designed to provide the financing
necessary to get the children into schools. Likewise, special teacher training programs,
focusing on upgrading the skills of the teacher trainers have been incorporated into the
project design. The project preparation team is confident that these focused activities will
enable the project counties and provinces to achieve their ambitious educational targets.
5.7    Equally critical to the success of the QVPEP is adequate funding of the student
assistance program for the 26 poor counties in this component. It is estimated that
approximately $3.0 million will be necessary to both keep 23,000 students in school who
are currently receiving funding and bring 34,000 non-enrolled children into schools. This
amount is approximately 20 percent of the projected counterpart funds for the project. In
order to mitigate this risk, the participating provinces will, as a condition of project
effectiveness, establish their student assistance programs with the full and initial deposits
(see para. 3.41). IDA will monitor the number of poor children needing financial
assistance in the 26 project counties, the continuing availability of existing student
support funds, new direct funding sources need to augment the income from the
educational foundations, and the interest income of the education foundations to assure
adequate funding for this part of the project.



- 56 -
5.8   There is some uncertainty in the project's ability to reach the enrollment targets
for girls and minorities. To mitigate this risk, the project has included counties and
institutions where the majority population is of minority nationality. Efforts made
through the dissemination program would be of help to counter traditional negative
parental and community attitudes to schooling for girls. For both minorities and girls,
earmarked funds from the student assistance program have been targeted to increase
enrollments at both primary and junior secondary levels, but funds available are as yet
insufficient to meet the needs. To deal with this, SEdC has two approaches: first, to
increase direct transfers for capital funds at project entities from the center; and second, to
stress to all implementation units that increased enrollments for these disadvantaged
groups is part of the national plan for NYCE.
5.9   Earlier projects have shown that inadequate two-way communication between
state, provincial and county authorities have slowed project implementation.  To
minimize this risk, logistical support in the form of monitoring, evaluation and reporting
mechanisms has been set up, reinforced by incremental improvements in the EMIS in all
project entities.

- 59 -                    ANNEX 1
ANNEX 1: HOUSEHOLD EDUCATION SPENDING IN
SHANXI AND YUNNAN
A. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
1.    This is a study of household education spending (HES) and access to basic
education in four nationally-designated poor counties in China: Loufan and Liulin in
Shanxi, and Luxi and Jiangchen in Yunnan. The major findings are as follows:
1.    HES averaged between 396 yuan to 802 yuan per year in the four counties in
1995. It constituted a significant part of household spending and net income, averaging
between 16.8 percent to 34.0 percent of the total spending of a household, and between
13.7 percent and 20.3 percent of the net income of a household.
2.   In 1995, HES was a heavy economic burden for a significant proportion of
households. For example, for 22-40 percent of the households in the four counties, HES
accounted for at least 20 percent of total household spending. And for 22-31 percent of
the households in the four counties, HES accounted for at least 20 percent of household
net income.
3.    HES per child increased sharply with the level of schooling. In 1995, HES per
child averaged 190 yuan for primary education, 482 yuan for lower-secondary education,
and 1143 yuan for upper-secondary education. However, HES per child varied
substantially across the four counties: it ranged between 117 and 269 yuan for primary
education, between 272 and 1149 yuan for lower-secondary education, and between 464
and 3103 yuan for upper-secondary education.
4.    Among the four counties, Luxi County in Yunnan had the highest percentage of
children aged 7-15 years not in school. In 1995, 6.3 percent of boys and 20.0 percent of
girls in this age groups were not in school in this county. Economic difficulty was the
reason indicated by 61 percent of parents who provided an explanation for their children's
absence from school. For the other three counties, between 2.4 and 4.2 percent of
children aged 7-15 years were not in school.
5.   In three of the four counties, parents have a higher desired level of educational
attainment for boys than for girls. The majority of parents in all four counties want their
children to have a post-secondary education.
6.    For the majority of parents in Loufan, Liulin, and Luxi (counties with 0 to 37
percent minority population), their desired level of education attainment for their children
is not economically attainable. In contrast, the great majority of parents in Jiangchen



- 60 -                    ANNEX 1
(with 83 percent minority population) think that their desired level of educational
attainment for their children is economically attainable.
7.    The great majority of parents in the four counties support a prompt
implementation of a textbook rental scheme to reduce the private cost of compulsory
education. Between 90 to 100 percent of parents in Loufan, Liulin, and Jiangchen want
to have a prompt implementation of a textbook rental scheme. In Luxi, 70 percent of
parents support implementation or experimentation of a textbook rental scheme; 30
percent oppose such a scheme.
8.    Difficulty with the language of instruction appears to be a minor problem in
Yunnan. Only 3 percent of parents think that their children have difficulty with
Putonghua. Between 1.3 to 3.2 percent of parents think that school should use bilingual
instructional materials.
9.    There is a compelling need to reduce the economic burden of household education
spending. Alternatives for reducing such spending should take account of variations and
diversities in different areas in China.
B. BACKGROUND
10.   The International Development Association of the World Bank Group is currently
assisting the Government of the People's Republic of China (China) in the preparation of
the Fourth Basic Education Project. This project covers 91 poor counties in the six
provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan, Hainan, Shanxi, Hunan, and Heilongjiang. The project
will contribute to the World Bank's involvement in the education sector in China,
namely, poverty reduction, teacher training, and the promotion of girls and minority
education in China.
11.   As part of the preparation of this project, this study examines household education
spending (HES) in four poor counties covered by the project. It is aimed at estimating the
magnitude of HES, assessing the economic burden of HES on households, and exploring
the impact of HES on access to compulsory schooling (grades 1-9) for children from poor
backgrounds. The findings may be used to inform decisions regarding alternative
strategies for reducing the economic burden of the direct private costs of compulsory
education.
C. METHODOLOGY AND BASIC STATISTICS OF SAMPLE
12.   Household education spending (HES) consists of expenditures by households on
children's schooling, such as expenditures on miscellaneous school fees, textbooks,
stationery, as well as additional expenditures on clothing, food, and other boarding costs
as a result of schooling. HES usually increases with the level of schooling. The
economic burden of HES can be assessed by determining the extent to which households
have to devote their resources to schooling. Two common indicators are used: HES as a
percentage of total household spending, and HES as a percentage of household net



-61-                      ANNEX 1
income. Additional evidence comes from information on household borrowing and
subsidy for schooling purposes. The impact of the economic costs of schooling (HES
plus the foregone benefits of child labor) may be explored by examination information on
the absence of school-aged children from schooling, and parents' explanation for such
absence.
13.   This study consists of a survey of 100 households in each of four project counties.
With input from the State Education Commission (SEdC), China, an instrument was
designed to collect the necessary information.  SEdC also provided the overall
coordination for data collection. The data were actually collected in June-July, 1996 by
the socioeconomic survey teams of the State Statistics Bureau in the concerned counties.
The households were selected on the basis of a sampling strategy used by the State
Statistics Bureau in its annual rural household survey. For both provinces, 1996
information on basic statistics of households was collected; 1995 information was
obtained on household income and household expenditure on various items, including
education.
14.   Among the four counties, two are located in Shanxi Province (Loufan County and
Liulin County), and two are located in Yunnan Province (Luxi County and Jiangchen
County). Table 1 provides basic statistics on the four counties, for all the households in
the survey as well as for households in the survey with children in school. Compared
with the counties in Shanxi, the counties in Yunnan have more minorities, have larger
family size, have more children in school, and have much lower educational attainment
for mothers relative to fathers. In China, minority families are allowed to have more
children than the Han majority. The two counties in Yunnan have significantly different
level of per-capita income. The two counties in Shanxi are quite similar to one another.
Table 2 shows the distribution of children by level of schooling in the sample.
15.   Findings on household education spending in the four counties are discussed in
the following. Since the findings are based on a case study of counties with their
distinctive characteristics, careful consideration is necessary in generalizing the findings
to other poor counties in China.
D. HOUSEHOLD EDUCATION SPENDING
16.   Since most households in the four counties have more than one child in school,
one can examine how much a household spends on one child and on all children in
school.
Direct Private Costs (DPCs) of Schooling
17.   Table 3 shows how much households spent on each child's schooling (DPC) in
1995. There are obvious differences in DPCs across schooling levels, between counties,
and between boys and girls.



- 62 -                    ANNEX 1
18.   HES per student increased sharply with the level of schooling. For the four
counties, HES per student averaged 190 yuan for primary education, 482 yuan for lower-
secondary education, and 1,143 yuan for upper-secondary education. At the primary
level, most of the HES was on books and stationary. At the lower-secondary level,
spending on books remained a substantial part of total HES; however spending on the
"others" category (including spending on transportation, uniform, boarding, and other
items) was also significant. At the upper-secondary level, "others" and fees were the
largest spending categories.
19.   However, HES per child varied substantially across the four counties: it ranged
between 117 and 269 yuan for primary education, between 272 and 1149 yuan for lower-
secondary education, and between 464 and 3103 yuan for upper-secondary education.
Jiangchen, which had the lowest per-capita net income in 1995, also had the lowest per-
student spending at each level of schooling.
20.   At the primary level, the DPCs for boys and for girls were basically the same in
the four counties. At the lowest-secondary level, the DPCs for girls were clearly higher
than those for boys in three of the four counties; however the opposite is true in the fourth
county.
Total Household Education Spending
21.   Total HES is the sum of household spending on all the children's schooling. Row
(1) of Table 4 shows that, on the average, total HES amounted to 436 yuan in Loufan,
443 yuan in Liulin, 802 yuan in Luxi, and 396 yuan in Jiangchen. Luxi had the highest
HES because families in Luxi spent more per student and had more students per family
(see Table 1 and Table 3). Jiangchen had the lowest HES because it had the lowest per-
student HES, even though it had the highest number of students per family.
E. ECONOMIC BURDEN OF HOUSEHOLD EDUCATION SPENDING
HIES as a Proportion of Total Household Spending
22.   One common international measure of the economic burden of HES is HES as a
percentage of total household spending (abbreviated as EBS). Presumably, a household
with a higher EBS has a heavier economic burden than another household with a lower
EBS. Row 2 of Table 4 shows that this spending-based measure averages between 16.8
percent for Loufan households to 34.0 percent for Luxi households. These averages are
significantly higher than the 2-4 percent levels for the rural and urban households in the
Beijing Metropolitan area, and the 1-4 percent levels for a number of developing
countries
23.   Assume that 20 percent is the threshold level above which economic burden of
schooling is considered heavy. Row 3 of Table 4 shows that between one-fifth and two-
fifths of the households had a heavy economic burden in 1995.



- 63 -                    ANNEX 1
24.   Row 4 of Table 4 shows a measure of economic burden preferred by education
officials in China. This measure is the ratio of the sum of HES of all the households with
children in school to the sum of the total household spending of all the households with
children in school. It shows the proportion of the total spending of all households (with
children in school) in a county that is devoted to the schooling of children in the county.
HES as a Proportion of Household Net Income
25.   Another common international measure of the economic burden of schooling is
HES as a percentage of household net income (abbreviated as EBI). Again, a higher EBI
is presumed to be associated with a heavier economic burden. Row 5 shows that EBI
averages between 13.7 percent for Jiangchen households to 20.3 percent for Luxi
households. It also shows that between 22.0-31.0 percent of the households in the four
counties have EBIs that are higher than the threshold level of 20 percent.
F. ABSENCE FROM SCHOOL AND ECONOMIC BURDEN
26.   Table 6 presents the percentage of children aged 7-12 years and 7-15 years not in
school. It shows that the absence rates were higher for Yunnan counties than Shanxi
counties. For the two counties in Shanxi, absence rates for boys and for girls are quite
similar. However, this is not the case in Yunnan. For Luxi, girls' rates are about three
times those of boys. For Jiangchen counties, boys' rates are higher than girls' rates. It is
instructive to note that 83 percent of the population in Jiangchen are minorities; and
minority parents in Jiangchen do not have a bias against girls with respect to schooling.
27.   Parents were asked about the reason for their children's absence from school. For
Luxi county in Yunnan, which had the highest absence rates among the four counties, 61
percent of parents indicated economic burden of HES to be the reason for their children's
absence from school. Economic burden of HES was not quoted as the reason for school
absence in the other county in Yunnan. In Shanxi, one-sixth of parents in Loufan and
one-third of parents in Liulin mentioned the economic burden of HES to be the reason for
their children's absence from school.
G. PARENTAL EDUCATION EXPECTATION
28.   Parents' schooling decisions (such as decisions regarding school attendance and
amount of HES) are related to their education expectation for their children. In this
study, parents were asked about the level of schooling that they would like their children
to attain. The majority of parents want their children to have post-secondary education
(see Table 7). Overall, parents in Yunnan counties have higher educational expectation
than those in Shanxi. Except for Liulin County, parental educational expectation is
higher for boys than for girls.
29.   The survey also asked parents to compare the economically-attainable level of
education with the desired level of education for their children. The gap between the two
reflects partly the influence of private costs of schooling on educational attainment.



- 64 -                    ANNEX 1
Table 8 shows that, for Loufan, Liulin, and Luxi counties, desired level of education
exceeds economically-attainable level of education for the majority of families.
However, for Jiangchen, the desired level of education matches the economically-
attainable level of education for 73 percent of the families. The results for boys and girls
are similar.
H. PARENTS' VIEW ON TEXTBOOK RENTAL SCHEME
30.   As indicated in Table 3, spending on textbooks constitutes a significant part of
total household spending on education. Reducing household spending on textbooks is
one way of reducing household spending on education and thus the economic burden of
such cost. In this study, parents were asked about their opinion on a textbook rental
scheme for reducing household spending on textbooks. According to this scheme,
parents pay the cost of a set of textbooks at the beginning of the schooling year. At the
end of the school year, they can return the textbooks for a partial refund or credit for
purchasing next year's textbooks. Table 9 shows that the great majority of parents in
three of the four counties do want to have a prompt implementation of such a scheme.
Opposition to the scheme is found in Luxi where 30 percent of the parents do not want to
have such a scheme.
I. LANGUAGE OF INSTRUCTION
31.   Yunnan province has a significant proportion of minority population. Parents in
the two Yunnan counties were asked two questions concerning the language of
instruction in primary school. The first question deals with proficiency in Putonghua (the
"common" language used by the Han majority). About 97 percent of the parents think
that their children are proficient in understanding and speaking Putonghua. 3 percent of
the parents think that bilingual instruction is needed because of their children's difficulty
with Putonghua. The second question concerns the use of bilingual instructional
materials in school. Between 1.4 and 3.2 percent of the parents indicate that school
should use bilingual instructional materials. The great majority of parents think that there
is no need to use such materials.
J. CONCLUSIONS
32.   Household education spending constitutes a significant part of total household
expenditure or net household income. It is a heavy economic burden for 20 to 40 percent
of households in the four poor counties in Shanxi and Yunnan. Difficulty with the
private costs of schooling is an important contributing factor for children's absence from
school. For most of the households in this study, their desired level of education for their
children is not economically attainable. There is thus a compelling need to reduce the
private costs of schooling, as part of the overall effort to achieve nine-year compulsory
education in China. Alternatives for reducing such costs should be considered and
experimented, including the establishment and strengthening of a student-assistance
progran, and a textbook rental scheme. These alternatives should also take account of
variations and diversities in different areas in China.

ANNEX 2: PROPOSED FOURTH BASIC EDUCATION
PROJECT QUESTIONNAIRE CONCERNING REVIEW OF
OED AUDITS
INVESTMENT PROJECTS
1.    How many OED audit reports have been done on projects in the same
subsector as the proposed project for: (a) the same country 0; (b) the same region 4;
and (c) for all countries worldwide 14.
2.    What are the main technical design lessons learned from these audit reports?
From the OED reports and relevant IDA projects in related sectors in China, the lessons
learned are as follows:
(a)   Project design should not be overly complex or overly optimistic in its
expectations. Greater awareness of the difficulties of expanding and
improving education in impoverished areas should take this into
consideration in project design.
(b)   An effective monitoring and evaluation systems should be established
prior to project implementation to assess project development impact.
(c)   Early involvement and participation of stakeholders especially at the
county level, helps to ensure smooth implementation, accountability and
sustainability.
(d)   In projects with larger proportions of civil works in dispersed
impoverished rural areas there is a need to include an architect on the
Bank project assistance team.
3.    What are the main policy and institutional design lessons learned from these
audit reports? From the OED reports and relevant IDA projects in related sectors in
China, the lessons leamed are as follows:
(a)   Follow-up projects pursuing similar objectives to those of previous
projects help to strengthen and eventually consolidate earlier
achievements, which might otherwise falter and fade away. Thus, follow-
up projects should be part of a long-term investment program with clearly
defined objectives based on sound sector work.
(b)   Importance of ownership on the part of the implementing agencies.



-66-                       ANNEX2
(c)   Importance of sustained commitment on the part of the borrower to
provide the necessary resources to support basic education.
(d)   The project should be flexible enough to accommodate mid-course
corrections in scope, content, and approach. Experts panels should be
established to review implementation address issues relevant to mid-
course corrections.
(e)   Increasing access for girls, minority and poor children to quality primary
education must be addressed by innovative enrollment policies and student
assistance programs.
4.    How has the proposed project design benefited, if at all, from the above
review of lessons learned?
(a)   The project began with a joint Bank/Borrower training course on project
design, which included individuals from the preparation and implementing
agencies. The utilization of monitorable indicators was a component of
the project training course. (2a, 2b)
(b)   The borrower and provincial education authorities have been responsible
for organizing the participation of stakeholders at the provincial and
county levels to develop proposals which include local level identification
of issues and optimal solutions. Because this is a repeater project, this
process was facilitated by using experiences and models from earlier
projects. (2c, 3a, 3b)
(c)   A Chinese experts panel has been used to assist in the design of project
components and will be used during project implementation to provide
ongoing high level professional monitoring of project implementation.
(2b, 3a, 3d)
(d)   A county financing study and household survey has been initiated to better
understand what the necessary commitment is for sustaining appropriate
levels of support for basic education. (3c)
(e)   The innovation component aims at supporting action oriented research
programs that will identify innovative approaches to improving access for
girls, minorities and poor children. (3e)

ANNEX 7: PILOT TEXTBOOK RENTAL SCHEME
1.    Rationale. Household spending on education is a heavy economic burden for a
significant proportion of households in China, especially households from poor
backgrounds. Surveys of households in several provinces in China have shown that such
an economic burden is an important contributing factor to parents' decision not to send
their children to school. Reducing the costs of schooling to families is a strategy for
promoting access to compulsory education in China. In primary education, textbook
costs constitute the largest component (30-40 percent) of household education spending
at that level. Reducing the cost of textbooks to parents is thus a significant way of
reducing household spending on primary education. The overall purpose of this pilot
activity is to study the feasibility of the scheme and, if successful, to disseminate its
findings in other poor areas within the provinces as well as other provinces.
2.    Objectives. By reducing the cost of textbooks to parents, this project activity
seeks to achieve three objectives:  (a) improving access to compulsory education;
(b) improving efficiency in the utilization of scarce resources; and (c) promoting
students' discipline and care of books.
3.    Organizational Arrangements. The textbook rental scheme will be piloted in 4
village schools in 2 counties in Shanxi Province under the aegis of SEdC and the PEdC.
The Shanxi PEdC will be responsible for designing, implementing and evaluating the
activity. The pilot will be organized as described below:
3  A Project Management Group (PMG) will have overall responsibility. It will
comprise education researchers from the Higher Education Institute of
Taiyuan Industrial University, education administrators from the concerned
county education bureaus and the principals from pilot schools.  The
responsibilities of the PMG will be to develop the project action plan; train the
operational staff; supervise the utilization of funds; ensure that the suitably
protected (plastic, cloth) textbooks become available to students; monitor the
progress of the pilot; and organize annual exchange of experience. The
researchers from the University will be responsible for analyzing the results of
the pilot and writing up the report.
*  A Project Implementation Group (PIG) will also be established. It will
comprise pilot school principals, staff from the instruction divisions of the
county education bureaus and pilot class teachers. The responsibilities of the
PIG include awareness and information campaigns among parents and pupils,
carry out the operational activities of the scheme, and collect, collate and
document the results of the pilot.



- 73 -                     ANNEX7
4.    The guidelines for participating counties and schools include the following
(details are available in project files):
* parents pay for the full cost of a set of textbooks (about Y 70 per year in 1996)
at the beginning of the school year;
* at the end of the school year, parents return the textbooks to the school for a
partial refund or credit towards the purchase of textbooks in the next school
year;
* the amount of refund or credit will depend on the condition of the returned
textbooks to be determined by the PIG;
* the school will re-issue the returned textbooks to students in the following
year; and
* the activity will be tried out in Grades 1-6.
5.    Activities.
(a)   September 1997: Training for principals and teachers of pilot schools on
running the pilot scheme; awareness campaigns among parents and pupils;
new books will be wrapped with protective plastic covers;
(b)   February 1998:  Review the utilization experience and cover new
textbooks for the second school term;
(c)   July 1998: Collect all rental books, provide refunds as required, identify
and record reasons for nonreturn books;
(d)   September 1998: Begin next round of distribution and monitoring of
books;
(e)   September 1999: Review scheme, take note of damaged books, take
decision on whether to continue with another cycle;
(f)   October 1999: Collate and analyze data from pilot schools;
(g)   March 2000: Complete the analysis and report.
6.    Outcomes. Lessons will be learned on how to implement a textbook rental
scheme. Reactions of parents, school personnel, students, administrators, and textbook
publishers will be documented. Provinces will have the opportunity to discuss the
outcomes and adopt such schemes if they are found to be workable.
7.    Costs. The activity will be designed such that it will not affect the existing
procedures in the production of textbooks. The personnel involved (in the pilot schools
and in the County Education Bureau) will carry out this activity as part of their regular
work. There will be some relatively small spending on book shelves, plastic covers, and



- 74 -                     ANNEX7
materials for documenting the project activity. The funding will come from counterpart
finds.
8.    Monitoring and Evaluation.  The Shanxi PEdC, with the assistance of
researchers from Taiyuan Industrial University, will devise appropriate measures for
monitoring and evaluating the scheme on the bases of the three objectives (para. 2). The
evaluation will identify conditions that contribute to the effectiveness or otherwise of the
scheme in each of the pilot schools. A report will be prepared for the Mid-Term Review.
9.    Benefits. The activity will contribute to the identification of conditions for
designing an effective textbook rental scheme. As indicated in the economic and
financial analysis, the potential savings in textbook costs are substantial. The three
objectives are all important benefits.  Should the scheme pose implementation
difficulties, important lessons would have been learnt about the sources of such
difficulties. The investment cost is small compared to the potential benefits.
10.   Risks.
(a)   Poor quality of paper;
(b)   Poor quality of plastic cover, offering inadequate protection;
(c)   Negative habits of pupils toward caring for books;
(d)   Some parents may not support the scheme, wanting to keep textbooks for
review purposes;
(e)   Some parents' preference for new books for children; and
(f)   Frequent changes in textbooks which will undermine the effectiveness of
such a scheme.
11.   Sustainability. The State Education Commission will provide assistance in the
dissemination of the findings of this pilot activity. If found workable where reviewed,
both Project and nonproject provinces will have the opportunity to establish such
schemes, adapting them as appropriate to suit local conditions.

ANNEX 12: TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR JUNIOR
SECONDARY SCIENCE TEACHERS
1.    Rationale.  Qualitative deficiencies exist in teacher performance due to
inadequate pre-and in-service training of science teachers. Teacher training has not kept
pace with the curriculum changes in science and mathematics. It is imperative to re-train
teachers through well planned inservice training programs in science teaching. The
strategies and inputs set out below could be modified for initial teacher training
programs.
2.    Objectives
(a)   To improve knowledge and professional skills of junior secondary science
teachers;
(b)   To improve the pedagogic skills of all junior secondary science teachers;
(c)   To provide high quality resources for inservice training of science teachers
with special focus on school-based staff development; and
(d)   To promote initiative and innovation at school level through fostering
cooperation between local schools in providing for their own staff
development.
3.    Strategies
(a)   Develop self-study training modules for science teaching in basic
education with assistance from best available science educators;
(b)   Initiate a training of trainers program with specific roles assigned to
teacher training institutions;
(c)   Establish a sustainable system of summer schools/inservice training using
the modules as the main instructional material; and
(d)   Using self study modules, encourage the establishment of a school-based
staff development system through pilots.
4.    Inputs. SEdC's Teacher Training Department is preparing and trialing a set of
training materials based on an evaluative survey of available teacher training resources.
Apart from specially planned training programs, in order to improve the quality of



-91-                       ANNEX 12
trainers who are to use the materials with their trainees, inputs should be estimated to
provide the following:
(a)   Institutional responsibility for development of modules;
(b)   Panel of experts, comprising of both content and education technology
experts, to write modules;
(c)   Trial and validation of modules;
(d)   Inservice training strategy involving county-based teacher support
programs, summer schools or short-term inservice training, with clearly
defined roles; and
(e)   One of the planned inservice inputs is a workshop for approximately 50
trainees to be held in May 1998 at Yunnan Agriculture University in
Kunming, Yunnan Province. Trainees will include one international
consultant and two local consultants. Details are available in project files.
5.    Assumptions
(a)   This is a major effort, rather a movement, involving upgrading of science
trainers and teachers to improve science education and requires careful
planning.
(b)   Development of self study modules is crucial as through good learning
resources average teachers' trainers could become more effective.
(c)   School-based staff development would ensure reaching out to a large
number of teachers. Provinces and counties may want to assess the
catalytic efforts of the primary level Teacher Services Network and
consider the feasibility of establishing a network along fairly similar lines
at the junior secondary level with a focus on science teaching.
(d)   Improving science teaching at the junior secondary science level is critical
to the Government of China's reform plans for broad-based economic and
social development. For the majority of rural junior secondary graduates,
the program is the terminal point of their formal education experience.
Key messages received and skills developed will have long-term spin-offs
for agriculture, environment, income generation, occupational mobility,
nutrition and general family health, to name a few outcomes. The existing
centrally-planned curriculum includes much of this content but the
majority of trainers nor teachers have the skills required to impart this to
students.



- 92 -                    ANNEX 13
ANNEX 13: TEACHER SERVICES NETWORK
1.    Objective. The Teacher Services Network (TSN) will provide professional
services which would support village level, school-based activities aimed at increasing
understanding and knowledge of teaching and learning, improving pedagogical skills, and
developing peer interaction to reduce professional isolation. The TSN will be piloted in
two selected counties in each of the six project provinces.
2.    Guidelines for Setting Up the TSNs. This Annex describes general guidelines
to be considered when setting up the TSNs in the various provinces. They were discussed
and identified during project preparation. In order to assess the practical working of such
a Network, Yunnan Province will pilot a TSN in its Honghe region and some prefectures
in Luxi county. (See project files for a detailed description of Yunnan's proposal.)
Provinces will draw from the results of the pilot and the guidelines in this Annex as a
basis for developing their own Network strategies.  Irrespective of the specific
organizational arrangements, professional support to village school teachers' problems
and difficulties will remain the focal point of this activity.
3.    Organizational Arrangements. The TSN will be developed along the following
guidelines, with appropriate local variations:
(a)   TSN Centers (the Center) will form the hub of the Network and Town
Central Primary Schools (TCPSs) in the twelve selected pilot counties will
be designated as TSN Centers;
(b)   TSN Organizing Group. The TSN will be organized at the county level by
a coordinating group comprising representatives from the prefecture level
Normal School, County Teaching and Research Group (within the County
Education Bureau) and the principal of the TSN Town Central Primary
School. The Normal School representative will head this group which will
ensure systematic planning, free flow of information and professional
input.
(c)   The TSN Teachers' Group will be formed, comprising TSN Town Central
Primary School principal (as head) and teacher representatives from the
village schools and teaching points served by the Center. This group will
identify and respond to teacher needs and liaise with the TSN Organizing
Group to form a two-way dialogue channel (see Figure attached).
(d)   The Normal School Curriculum Review Group comprising the Vice
Principal (Professional), the designated Head of Department who will
oversee the TSN components and other appropriate faculty members. This



- 93 -                    ANNEX 13
group will ensure the inclusion of TSN awareness (including objectives,
organization, functions and activities) in the Normal School final year
syllabus.
4.    Activities
(a)   Immediate and short-term activities will include preparatory steps to be
taken prior to the launch of the Centers:
(i)    a village school and teaching point level survey to identify the
professional needs of teachers;
(ii)   the planning of a TSN Center Program based on the survey results;
and
(iii)   the organization of an induction course on the TSN concept and
relevance for TSN Organizing Group members;
(b)   Long-term activities would encompass the following:
(i)   dissemination of information pertaining to education policies,
pedagogical principles, and techniques of cost-effective use of
library books and instructional equipment and materials;
(ii)   annual monitoring of needs of village school and teaching point
teachers to develop appropriate programs and activities;
(iii)   popularization of the production and use of low-cost teaching aids
using locally available materials; and
(iv)   incorporation of village community contribution to develop a sense
of ownership, responsibility and pride in the promotion of primary
education in the community.
5.    Monitoring and Supervision. The progress of the TSN will be supervised and
monitored by the TSN Organizing Group under the guidance of the PEdC, SEdC and
CEP. To assist monitoring and evaluation of project activities, four groups of indicators
have been identified:
(a)   Input Indicators
* formation of TSN Organization Group
* formation of TSN Teachers' Group
* distribution of library books and equipment to TSN Center



- 94 -                    ANNEX 13
* preparation of induction course content for TSN Organization Group
(b)   Output Indicators
* village teachers' needs assessment survey
* preparation of annual plan for TSN Center based on survey results
*  conduct of induction course for TSN Organization Group
*  number of activities organized for teachers at TSN Centers
*  number of village and teaching point teachers attending activities
(c)   Qualitative Indicators
* number of teachers using methods and teaching/learning aids as a
result of TSN Center activities
 number of lessons at which methods and teaching/learning aids are
used as a result of TSN Center intervention
6.    Risks. Factors which may interfere with the success of TSNs would include the
following:
(a)   change of personnel in the TSN Organizing Group and the TSN Teachers'
Group, particularly the Principal of the Central Primary School;
(b)   level of commitment to TSN among the education hierarchy from
provincial to town and village level;
(c)   poor selection and quality of equipment and books procured for TSN
activities;
(d)   inadequate budget allocations for TSN Center activities;
(e)   absence of maintenance budget for equipment; and
(f)   disruption of school schedule when teachers attend activities at TSN
Center during school term.
7.    Benefits
(a)   Village school teachers will have a regular channel of 'upward'
communication with those hierarchically above them.
(b)   More, importantly, they will have the means to communicate and interact
with peers regarding their daily teaching tasks.



- 95 -                    ANNEX 13
8.    Substainability
(a)   Since this is fundamentally a locally-based activity, there is high
probability that it will be well-supported by the community. This has been
borne out in other countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia.

program of expanding access to basic education, enhancing the quality of classroom
teaching and ensuring cost-effective utilization of laboratories, equipment and library
books.  Normal schools, which are usually under the jurisdiction of prefectural
governments, provide initial (residential) and inservice upgrading courses for unqualified
and qualified teachers for the primary level of schooling. All graduates are contracted to
return to their home areas.  Management capacity is weak and institutions are
inefficiently run with under-utilization of staff, space, equipment and libraries. Training
programs are heavily content based and textbook bound, with insufficient attention given
to the development of practical, classroom skills.
2.    Objectives
(a)   To provide training which will focus on updating of normal school trainers
training methods with special emphases on resource-aided, pupil-centered
and activity-oriented methodology;
(b)   To review the minority component of the training curriculum with the aim
of improving and expanding the content to suit local cultures and
conditions, bilingual education programs where required, and multigrade
teaching skills;
(c)   To provide effective human resources and institution management courses
for principals and other administrative personnel; and
(d)   To provide 46 normal schools training and resources to enhance their
inputs in the Teacher Services Network.
3.    Organizational Arrangements. The training programs for this sub-component
will be organized and managed by FILO/SEdC and SEdC's and PEdCs' Teacher Training
Department under the guidance of the CEP. The SEdC's Minority Education Department
will collaborate with the Teacher Training Department in those components relating to
the development and assessment of minority-related curriculum materials.
4.    Inputs. Approximately 7 percent of the total credit has been allocated for this
sub-component, with provincial distribution made a needs-basis. The planned project
inputs for 45 normal schools and one Teacher Training and Research Center (Hainan) are
the following:



-98 -                      ANNEX 14
(a)   training will be provided for 120 trainers;
(b)   management training will be provided for 46 school principals;
(c)   training will be provided for 46 laboratory directors; and
(d)   instructional equipment, books and materials amounting to USD XX will
be provided.
5.    Outcomes. The following outputs are expected:
(a)   strengthening of trainees' practical skills development which include a
range of teaching approaches to cater to the varied entry levels and
backgrounds of rural trainees, and the production of low-cost audio-visual
teaching aids and instructional materials;
(b)   a better managed set of institutions with improved utilization of staff,
libraries and laboratories;
(c)   improved skills in adapting the national curriculum for minority and local
situations;
(d)   contribution  to  the  sustainability  of Normal School graduates'
participation in the Teacher Services' Network as every trainee would be
aware of its significance; and
(e)   a cohort of re-trained trainers who will upgrade the quality of normal
school programs.
6.    Monitoring and Supervision. The PEdCs will be responsible for monitoring on
a regular basis. FILO/SEdC and the CEP will guide the PEdC and the institutions in the
overall change process. PEdCs will incorporate institutions annual reports in their own
APR reports annually for FILO/SEdC and IDA.
7.    Risks.  Weak management capacity at prefectural level has been a major
weakness in the quality upgrading of Normal Schools in BE II. The PEdCs, with proven
ability to better manage and provide professional leadership to training institutions will
assume responsibility for managing the implementation of this component.

ANNEX 17: DISSEMINATION OF SUCCESSFUL
EXPERIENCES
GUIDELINES FOR PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION
1.    Objective. The sub-component will document, disseminate and apply effective
and innovative educational experiments and successful experiences to overcome some of
the existing educational problems relative to education for girls and minorities at the
primary and junior secondary stages of education in project-supported counties.
2.    Organizational Arrangements. The dissemination activities will be carried out
in each project province based on approved project plans, implementation schedules,
budgets, completion targets, monitoring indicators and reporting procedures.
3.    The program will be implemented by the schools and township/County Education
Bureaus and supervised by the Provincial Education Commission, and monitored by the
Chinese Experts Panel (CEP), SEdC and IDA supervision missions. The CEP will
provide advice on the provincial dissemination programs, monitor their progress and
report on their implementation.
4.    Preparation of Draft Plans.  Each province, in consultation with County
Education Bureaus and Village Education Committees, may prepare Draft Plans for the
Dissemination Program and submit them to CEP and SEdC for review and approval.
These plans may include the following:
(a)   Specific educational problems in the areas of education for girls and
minorities to be addressed in project counties;
(b)   Successful experiences/projects which could be applied in project
counties;
(c)   Goals, objectives and targets;
(d)   Coverage and location of dissemination activities;
(e)   Activities and implementation schedules;
(f)   Budget by specific activity and by year; and
(g)   Monitoring and evaluation procedures including indicators (such as
number of activities completed, number of teachers/schools covered,
follow-up activities etc.)



-102 -                     ANNEX 17
5.    Project Planning and Review Procedures. The plans prepared for the Program
will be submitted to CEP and SEdC by October 1 annually. The package submitted will
include action plans and budgets for the following year, and after review and approval, be
sent to IDA with the total set of annual project action plans.
6.    The Program will be reviewed during the overall Mid-Term Review. A joint
CEP/FILO report with an analysis of activities completed will be presented for discussion
at the Mid-Term Review. Plans for the second half of the project will be discussed.
7.    Monitoring  of the Program.   The Dissemination  Program  will be
assessed/monitored by the CEP, FILO/SEdC, PEdCs and IDA in terms of the number of
innovations and successful experiences documented, number disseminated, and the
number of counties and schools which would have introduced them to solve some of the
specific educational problems.



-103 -                     ANNEX 18
ANNEX 18: MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT
1.    The objective of strengthening sectoral managerial capability is part of a long-
term program of reinforcing on-going institutional strengthening activities financed by
the Bank Group: the Educational Development in Poor Provinces (EDPP) Project (Cr.
2339-CHA), the Basic Education in Poor and Minority Areas (BE-II) Project (Cr. 2651-
CHA, and the Third Basic Education (BE-III) Project (Cr.283 1 -CHA).
2.    The program involves training state, provincial, county and institutional staff to
enhance their skills in planning and administration, and monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) of project implementation. The program will provide specialist services and the
appropriate equipment and materials for: (a) national-level management training for
provincial trainers, education managers and administrators, and project implementation
staff totaling about 2,300 personnel in the 91 project counties, (b) centrally-organized
seminars and workshops in support of various components, including the organization of
overseas study tours; and (c) improving the management and utilization of the
Educational Management Information System (EMIS) to strengthen general educational
administration and project implementation as part of a nationwide network through
CERNET (China Education and Research Computer Network) coordinated by the
Educational Management Information Center (EMIC). Overall guidance is provided by
FILO/SEdC and PEdCs. SEdC will organize and implement national-level project
activities in which each province has a shared responsibility, and the Chinese Experts
Panel will assist FILO/SEdC in monitoring project implementation.
3.    The EMIS in the project counties will be managed by about 200 staff. As a key
management tool, the EMIS will provide critical logistical support in education sector
management in general, and in project planning and implementation in particular. A
small component as measured by the funds earmarked for its development (total
investment $500,000), the EMIS nevertheless will have a potentially much larger impact.
Including BE-IV, the cumulative investment through earlier projects will amount to $12
million covering 620 counties. Properly organized and managed, the EMIS will have a
positive impact on raising the efficiency of project planning and implementation (e.g.,
annual action plans and annual progress reports), which would include M&E of various
project activities, from civil works construction to equipment procurement and staff
training. The cumulative experience of project planning and implementation will help
improve the effectiveness of collecting, processing and analysis of education sectoral
data. This is expected to be an on-going process that will provide relevant up-to-date
information for policy formulation and successive project planning and implementation.
4.    As China undergoes rapid economic and social change in accord with its opening
up policy, correct and timely basic information on the expected demographic



-104 -                    ANNEX 18
transformation and changes in size and distribution of the school-age population,
especially in rural and currently poverty-stricken areas, will have profound long-term
implications for the provision of education. The special areas needing attention include
maintaining the momentum of upgrading the quality of education through more effective
utilization of better-educated teachers, teacher-support services, and instructional
materials. Accurate information on all the above is the necessary foundation for an
effective management of the education sector. An effective EMIS will provide SEdC and
the PEdCs the logistical support for a modem education management system.
5.    SEdC will give special attention to ensuring that the EMIS computer hardware
and software will be compatible with those in the existing provincial and county EMISs
financed under previous Bank-supported projects and that staff will be provided the
appropriate training to operate the EMIS.

ANNEX 21: STUDENT ASSISTANCE GUIDELINES
9.    In order to ensure that primary school students are able to attend school in the
QVPEP project areas, Ningxia, Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces have established student
assistance programs that will support approximately 57,000 students each year in the
project areas for the five year project period. The provinces will assist these students
with ongoing government and non-government financing schemes as well as with
counterpart funding. The breakdown of resources and student numbers are as follows:
Table 1: Levels of Funding for Student Assistance Programs

10.   Education Funds. An education fund will be established at the provincial or
county level with an initial deposit in a commercial bank account as indicated in Table 1.
(See provincial feasibility reports for details.) The annual interest from the education
account, along with ongoing direct government support will be used to assist poor



111 -                      ANNEX21
students by reducing the miscellaneous fees and textbook charges. Each province has
calculated the number of students to be supported based on the current interest rate of 8
percent. However, should the interest be less than 8 percent then each province ensures
that the agreed number of students, as indicated in Table 2, must be supported. In order
to support these students additional direct support from the provinces will be made
available. Should the interest rate increase, then the additional resources should be used
to increase the numbers of students receiving support.
11.   Selection Process. The primary selection criteria is based on family per capita
income. (See Ningxia, Shaanxi and Sichuan provincial feasibility report in the project
files for individual per capita income selection criteria.) Once family per capita income
has been determined, the next priority in the selection process will be to provide
resources to girls and minorities.
12.   County education bureau administrators will notify school principals of the
availability of resources. Teachers will visit the famnilies to detennine if they are eligible
and discuss the assistance program with the parents. Parents will make a request for the
student assistance to their children's schools and a tentative list of names will be
compiled of those students eligible for assistance. The name list will then be submitted to
the township for verification and forwarded to the county education bureau for final
approval and selection of recipients.
13.   The levels of individual support will vary depending on the individual provincial
criteria. However, the average level of support for each student will be Y 50/year. These
grants are meant to largely subsidize school costs although in cases of extreme poverty,
full support can also be expected. The stipend will not be allocated to individual students
or their families but instead will be given to the appropriate school or education group to
offset the costs of textbooks and school fees. The subsidies will be recorded and
available for audit by the Association as well as Government officials.
14.   Monitoring. Progress reports on the students will be provided each semester to

ANNEX 24: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
1.    There are three major objectives for conducting economic and financial analyses
in project preparation and appraisal:  (a) informing project design so that project
resources are used more efficiently to achieve project goals; (b) assessing financial
feasibility to ensure that there are adequate resources to implement the project; and
(c) assessing financial sustainability to ensure that project outcomes can be sustained after
project completion.
2.    To achieve these major objectives, a variety of economic and financial analyses
have been conducted during the preparation of the Fourth Basic Education Project; these
analyses can be grouped into five areas: (a) overview of education expenditures;
(b) economic impacts of education in poor areas; (c) education and poverty reduction;
(d) financial aspects of project; and (e) internal efficiency improvement. The findings are
summarized briefly in the following. Details are given in the background documents
prepared for such analyses and can be found in the project file for economic and financial
analysis.
A. OVERVIEW OF EXPENDITURES IN THE EDUCATION SECTOR
3.    According to the government's strategic plan for education, the primary goals of
educational reform and development in China are to meet the changing human capital
needs of the growing economy and to contribute to poverty reduction. To achieve these
goals, the education system should achieve a number of broadly defined developmental
targets by the end of the twentieth century: a significant increase in the educational
attainment of the national population, further expansion of pre-employment education
and further education of the labor force, having appropriate stocks of different kinds of
skilled personnel to meet the needs of modernization, and establishing the basic
framework of an educational system with forward-looking and Chinese characteristics.
4.    A crucial part of these development targets concerns the attaimnent of nine-year
compulsory education. By the year 2000, primary education should enroll over 9 percent
of the school-age children and the enrollment ratio in lower-secondary education should
reach 85 percent. Compulsory education is seen by government policymakers as central
to education's contribution to economic growth and poverty reduction. While most of the
urban and coastal areas have already achieved nine-year compulsory education, the major
challenge lies in poor and inland areas. Besides intensifying local effort, these poor and
inland areas require additional support from higher levels of government to achieve their
compulsory education targets in a timely manner. From a national viewpoint, there
should be more government investment in compulsory education, especially in poor and



-115 -                     ANNEX24
inland areas. A review of education finance in China suggests that the government has
been moving in such a direction in recent years.
5.    The following table provides information on government expenditure on
education during the 1991-95 period.  Several changes in government education
expenditure between 1991 and 1995 can be observed: (a) education's share of total
government expenditure rose from 13.52 percent to 16.05 percent, reflecting the
government's increased commitment to education relative to other sectors; (b) the central
government's share in total education expenditure declined from 12.97 percent to 11.86
percent, consistent with the trend in decentralized educational financing initiated in the
1980s; and (c) higher education's share in total education expenditure decreased from
24.21 percent to 20.77 percent while the combined share for primary and secondary
education increased from 68.41 percent to 72.16 percent.

6.   In 1991, total education spending from all sources amounted to 73.15 billion
yuan, with 62.85 percent from government budgetary sources and 37.15 percent from
non-budgetary sources (enterprises, work study, education surcharges and levies, social
contributions, education fees, and others). Total education spending increased to 112.68
billion yuan in 1995 (in 1991 price), representing a real increase of 11.41 percent per
year. Even though the government spent more on education in 1995, its share dropped to
54.76 percent in 1995 because non-budgetary funds grew much faster than government
funds. These findings are consistent with financing trends during the second half of the
1980s and early 1990s. Thus non-budgetary sources have become more important over
time. Total education spending from all sources amounted to 3.38 percent of GNP in
1991 and 3.26 percent in 1995.

7.    Per-student expenditures on basic education have increased over time.  For
example, in primary education, per-student budgeted expenditure (from  government
budget) increased from 80 yuan (1992 price) in 1986 to 139 yuan in 1992. In general
secondary education, per-student budgeted expenditure increased from 224 yuan (1992
price) to 301 yuan over the same time period.

8.    While non-government sources have increased in importance over time, they also
contribute to substantial disparities in per-student education expenditure across regions in
China. In general, economically more developed regions can raise more non-government
resources for education than less developed regions. Also, because of low household
income and other adverse conditions, poor and inland regions are very limited in their



-117-                      ANNEX24
capacity to raise resources for education.  Additional targeted subsidies from the
government are needed to ensure that minimally acceptable level of education quality is
achieved. During the 1996-2000 period, the central government will spend 3.98 billion
yuan (with matching funds from provincial and local governments) to assist compulsory
education in poor areas.
B. ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF EDUCATION IN POOR AREAS
9.    Since the Fourth Basic Education Project is an investment project in basic
education in poor areas, the Association has attempted to quantify the economic impact of
basic education in poor areas in China in two ways: the economic return of basic
education for individuals, and the additional annual tax revenue for the local (county)
government.
Private Return to Basic Education
10.   Researchers at the Institute of Higher Education, Peking University, were asked
by the Association to estimate the economic return to basic education in poor areas in
China. The dataset for this study contains information on 3,709 rural residents from 23
poor counties in the six provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Yunnan, and
Guizhou in 1991. Four of these provinces (Hunan, Shanxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou) are
participating in the Fourth Basic Education Project. The analysis found that education
and earnings were significantly and positively correlated.  An additional year of
schooling was associated with an increase of 4.75 yuan in monthly earnings, the average
monthly earnings being 94.40 yuan. Using the elaborate method, it was found that the
unadjusted internal rate of return was 8.98 percent for primary education and 11.24
percent for lower-secondary education. These findings show that investment in basic
education in poor areas in China is quite profitable. Research in other countries has
shown that education also has important social and political benefits, such as reduction in
fertility rate, improvement in health, and contribution to national integration. Thus the
case for investment in basic education in poor areas in China will be even stronger if
these other less quantifiable benefits are applicable to China.
Additional Tax Revenue
11.  In China, the administration and financing of compulsory education (six years of
primary education plus three years of lower-secondary education) is primarily the
responsibility of local governments (governments at and below the county level).
Residents in rural China pay a variety of taxes and levies to the county government,
including rural education surcharges. Rural education surcharges are an established way
for financing compulsory education in rural China. They generally amount to one to two
percent of household income, with the precise surcharge rate determined locally. It is a
national policy that the total tax/levy should not exceed five percent of household
income. In addition, the poorest households (those under 400 yuan per capita per year)
can be exempted from rural taxes and levies. To illustrate the tax impact of compulsory
education, the following table presents estimates of additional taxes collected by project



-118 -                       ANNEX24
counties at the end of the project in 2002 (as compared with 1995). The calculation
assumes that: (a) compulsory education increases earned income by 5.0 percent; (b) 20
percent of residents in the project counties are exempted from rural taxes and levies;
(c) education surcharges amount to one percent of household income; and (d) total taxes
and levies amount to three percent of household income. These results show that there
are tangible benefits to the government in investment in compulsory education in poor
areas.

C. EDUCATION AND POVERTY REDUCTION
12.   Investment in basic education in poor areas is part of the government's overall
effort to reduce poverty in the country. To promote access to basic education for poor
families, four sets of strategies or activities have been incorporated in the design of the
project: targeting project resources at intended population groups, mobilizing additional
education funds for poor counties, continuing the innovation in student assistance, and
piloting a textbook rental scheme.
Targeting of Project Resources
13.   In order to direct project resources at the intended population groups, this project
has adopted the same targeting strategies used in the design of the Third Basic Education
Project. These strategies are: including only nationally-designated and provincially-
designated poor counties in the project, increasing the involvement of minority
populations in project activities, promoting girls education in project counties, and
placing more overall project investment in primary education than in lower-secondary
education. Throughout project preparation and appraisal, the proposed activities and
investment costs were carefully examined to encourage these targeting strategies.



-119-                      ANNEX24
Indicators are available to monitor progress in minority and girls education in project
counties.
Mobilization of Additional Education Funds for Poor Counties
14.   Additional funds for compulsory education will be provided by central,
provincial, and prefecture/city governments to poor counties. These funds are highly
desirable for at least two reasons: they increase the education resources for poor counties,
and they contribute to equality in the regional allocation of education resources.
15.   Central Fund for Compulsory Education in Poor Areas. During the Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), a categorical fund of 3.9 billion yuan from the
central government will be used in compulsory education in poor areas. This fund will be
used in the improvement in school facilities and the provision of equipment, furniture,
and books. Also, for each of the five years beginning in 1997, an additional 20 million
yuan will be allocated by the central government for student assistance in poor areas.
While the precise distribution of the central funds by provinces is not known yet, it is
expected that some of the project counties and project provinces will receive the central
fund.
16.   Additional Education  Funds  from   Provincial  and  Prefecture/City
Governments. Provincial and prefecture/city governments will provide additional
education funds to poor counties in two ways: they will match (one-to-one ratio) the
central fund for compulsory education in poor areas, and they provide the majority of
counterpart funding (see Section D on counterpart funding for amount) to support project
activities in the project counties.
Innovation in Student Assistance
17.   Household Education Spending Survey. As part of the preparation of this
project, a survey of households in four project counties was conducted. The survey was
aimed at ascertaining the amount of household education spending, and assessing the
economic burden of such spending and its impact on access to basic education for
children from poor background. Two of the counties are located in Shanxi province and
the other two in Yunnan province. Information from one hundred households in each
county was collected by the socioeconomic survey teams of the State Statistics Bureau
located in the concerned counties. The households were selected based on the sampling
method used by the State Statistics Bureau in its annual survey of rural households in
China.
18.   Analysis of the survey data found that household education spending averaged
between 13.7 percent and 20.3 percent of household net income. For 22-31 percent of the
households in the four counties, education spending was a heavy economic burden.
Among the four counties, Luxi County in Yunnan has the highest percentage of children
aged 7-15 years not in school. For example, in 1995, 6.3 percent of boys and 20.0
percent of girls in this age group were not in school in this county; the economic burden



-120-                       ANNEX24
of private costs of schooling was the reason indicated by 61 percent of the parents. There
is a compelling need to reduce the economic burden of household education spending in
order to encourage school attendance.
19.   Student Assistance Program. The findings of the household survey lend strong
support to the student assistance program initiated in the Third Basic Education Project.
Both SEdC and the Bank Association agree that this innovation in student assistance
should be continued as a component of the Fourth Basic Education Project. In fact, SEdC
has requested and obtained additional funding from the Ministry of Finance for
supporting a student assistance program. Between 1.6-6.2 percent of the counterpart fund
of the various project provinces will be allocated to this component. The project
provinces will develop guidelines for: (a) eligibility for assistance (including special
treatment of poor female and minority students); (b) procedure for applying for assistance
and evaluation of applications; (c) financing of the student-assistance fund; and
(d) monitoring and management of the program. It is estimated that, at the primary level,
the component will cover between 5.2-22.2 percent of the eligible primary students in the
project counties annually. For all six provinces, the component provides financial
assistance to 20,357 primary students per year or 11.0 percent of the eligible students.
20.   The Association has made the following requests to the project provinces:
(a) using a higher proportion of the interest proceeds from the fund on primary education
than on lower-secondary education (say a ratio of 7:3); (b) giving higher priority to poor
female and minority students; (c) using central student-assistance fund as seed money for
the program; (d) developing a program plan for 1997-2002 (to indicate the coverage of
poor students over time, and the financing sources); and (e) providing indicators to
monitor the number of poor female and minority students receiving financial assistance.
Piloting of a Textbook Rental Scheme
21.   Cutting the costs of textbooks to parents is one way to reduce the economic
burden of household education spending. The survey of households in four project
counties also found overwhelming support by parents for a textbook rental scheme.
According to a version of this scheme, a parent pays for the full cost of a set of textbooks
(about 75 yuan per year) at the beginning of the school year. At the end of the school
year, the parent returns the textbooks to the school for a partial refund (about 45 yuan) or
credit towards the purchase of textbooks in the next school year. The amount of refund
or credit will depend on the condition of the returned textbooks. The school will issue the
returned textbooks to next year's student. A textbook is expected to last for three years.
The textbook rental scheme actually has three objectives: (a) reducing the cost of
textbooks to parents and thus the barrier in access to basic schooling; (b) improving
efficiency in the utilization of a scarce education resource; and (c) promoting students'
discipline and care of books.
22.   During visits to schools in Hunan, Heilongjiang, and Hainan, the Association has
also found support for such a scheme from school principals, teachers, and education



-121-                         ANNEX24
officials. However, some education officials have expressed concern about the durability
of existing textbooks and the desire of some parents to keep textbooks for review
purposes. SEdC and the Bank Association have agreed that a textbook rental scheme
needs to be piloted before being considered for wider application. The provincial
education commission of Shanxi province has agreed to conduct the piloting in this
project and it will obtain the necessary fumd to support this study.
D. FINANCIAL ANALYSES
23.   To ensure that the project is feasible during the implementation years and that
project effectiveness is sustained after project completion, three types of financial
analyses have been conducted: financial feasibility analysis, financial sustainability
analysis, and assessment of the availability of counterpart funding.
Financial Feasibility Analysis
24.   Financial feasibility analysis has been conducted at three levels: county level,
provincial level, and national level.
25.   County Level. For each project county, the required resources (recurrent and
capital) for achieving the proposed compulsory education plan during the period 1997-
2002 were compared with the projected available resources for compulsory education
during the same period. For project counties in most of the project provinces, required
resources were found to exceed available resources by relatively small amounts; the gap
was eliminated by the commitment of additional provincial and central funds. However,
there was a substantial gap for counties in Guizhou which was subsequently addressed by
lowering the development goals of compulsory education in those counties.  The
following table presents the resultant distribution of domestic resources to finance the
proposed compulsory-education plan in the project counties.

26.   Provincial Level. For each project province, the required resources (recurrent
and capital) for achieving the proposed compulsory education plan during the period
1997-2002 were compared with the projected available resources for compulsory
education during the same period. The required resources were found to exceed available
resources by varying degree across the project provinces. The gap was eliminated by a
number of measures, including the mobilization of additional resources from government
and non-government sources, and the lowering of development goals for compulsory
education in the concerned provinces.  The following table presents the resultant
distribution of domestic resources to finance the proposed compulsory-education plan in
the project provinces.

27.   National level. As part of the preparation of the Third Basic Education Project,
SEdC informed the Association that it had conducted a financial feasibility analysis for
the development of compulsory education in all the nationally-designated poverty
counties during the Ninth Plan Period. The analysis estimated the financial gap in these
counties. The financial gap will be addressed primarily by additional funds from higher
levels of government. During the preparation of the Fourth Basic Education Project,
SEdC indicated to the Association that the central government had already started
allocating additional central fund for compulsory education in poor counties which would
total 3.9 billion yuan during the Ninth Plan Period. Also, for each of five years beginning
in 1997, an additional 20 million yuan will be allocated by the central government for
student assistance in poor areas.
Financial Sustainability
28.   The financial sustainability of the project is assessed by comparing the projected
total recurrent cost of compulsory education in project counties in 2002 with the
projected recurrent resources for compulsory education in project counties in 2002. The
total recurrent cost in 2002 is the sum of the total regular recurrent costs of personnel and
non-personnel inputs in 2002 and the total annual recurrent cost implication of the
project. The total annual recurrent cost implication of the project is equal to the sum of
the annual costs to maintain the effectiveness of project investment in school buildings,



-123 -                        ANNEX24
equipment, furniture, and technical assistance. In this analysis, the annual cost of
maintenance of an education input is estimated to be the product of a coefficient for that
input and the project investment in that input. The coefficient will vary across education
inputs and across project counties. It is between one and two percent for school
buildings, between three and four percent for equipment, between one and two percent for
furniture, and between 0.1 and 0.3 percent for technical assistance. The projected
recurrent resources were estimated on the basis of the actual recurrent expenditure in
1995 and a historical growth rate.
29.   Initial analysis indicated that the project would not be financially sustainable in all
the project provinces because of a number of reasons, including an underestimation of
projected recurrent resources (based on conservative growth rates), an overestimation of
recurrent cost implication, and unrealistic development targets. By properly estimating
the projected costs and resources and adjusting development targets,  financial
sustainability was subsequently demonstrated at appraisal, The results are shown in the
following table.

Availability of Counterpart Funding
30.   The analyses of financial feasibility and sustainability have led to some lowering
of development targets in project provinces (particularly Guizhou) and subsequent
adjustment in the counterpart ratio. The sources of financing for counterpart funding
were carefully examined. A positive development in project preparation was that project
provinces had taken the suggestion of the Association to reduce the burden of counterpart
funding on project counties. By committing additional fund, governments at the
provincial and prefecture/city levels will be responsible for the majority of counterpart
funding; county governments' share ranges from 30-47 percent of the total counterpart
funding only. This distribution reduces the risk of inadequate counterpart funding from
county governments. In addition, project counties were advised by the Association to
raise more counterpart funding during the first year of the project so as to meet the



-124 -                          ANNEX24
demand for counterpart funding during the second year of the project. The following

E. INTERNAL EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT
31.    Throughout project preparation, provincial representatives were encouraged to
design the project so as to improve the efficiency in the utilization of resources in
education. This section provides quantitative illustration of the expected improvement in
internal efficiency due to the project in three areas: reduction in repetition rates, a
textbook rental scheme, and the utilization of resources in secondary normal schools.
Simulation in Recurrent Cost Savings by Reducing Repetition Rates
32.    One of the effects of the project is the reduction in repetition rates of compulsory
education in project counties. This increase in internal efficiency will result in recurrent
cost savings, which can be used to expand new enrollment and/or improve education
quality. This analysis simulates the recurrent cost savings in grade 1.
33.    Data from  the six provinces in the Education Development in Poor Provinces
(EDPP) Project shows that, between 1988 and 1995, repetition rate in grade I decreased
by an average of eight percent per year. This rate of reduction was used to estimate the
recurrent cost savings in the project counties of the Fourth Basic Education Project; the
results are given in the following table. It should be noted that the reduction in repetition
rates in the EDPP Project was due to a combination of factors: quality improvement (such
as better trained teachers, and provision of instrument materials, etc.) and administrative
policy (principals were instructed to reduce the number of repeaters). However, no
information is available on the relative contribution of the two factors. Thus the table
provides three sets of estimates of the ratio of recurrent cost savings to investment in



-125 -                          ANNEX24
primary education in the project counties, corresponding to three different assumptions
about the proportion of contribution due to quality improvement. The results pertain to
grade 1 only; the ratio will be several times larger if recurrent cost savings in grades 2 to
6 are included.

Savings in costs of textbooks in project provinces
34.    A textbook rental scheme will be piloted in Shanxi province during the project. If
the piloting is successful, the scheme can be applied in other areas in China. This
analysis illustrates the magnitude of the potential savings in the costs of textbooks if a
successful textbook rental scheme were implemented in the project provinces in 1996. It
assumes that there will be a 60 percent reduction in textbook costs per year. The table
shows that the savings in textbook costs are quite substantial in amount. The savings
would also amount to 3.30-8.74 percent of education expenditure (budgetary and extra-
budgetary education funds) in 1996.

Resource Utilization in Secondary Normal Schools
35.   As part of the preparation of the project component on secondary normal schools,
provincial officials were encourage to scrutinize the utilization of personnel and non-
personnel resources in these schools and provide indicators for monitoring the efficiency
in resource utilization. As a result of the discussion between the Association and the
Chinese counterparts, three indicators have been identified and their expected values are
given in the llLowing table. Note that the ratio of instructional staff to non-instructional
staff is used to control the number of excessive non-instructional staff in secondary
normal schools. A larger ratio means that there are more instructional staff relative to
non-instructional staff.  SEdC's standard norm  for the student to teacher ratio in
secondary normal schools is around 11. "Laboratory hours of utilization" refers to the
average number of hours that laboratories in a secondary normal school are actually
utilized for instructional purposes. A 50 percent utilization rate corresponds to 20 hours
per week.

Learning Achievement as Outcome Measure
36.   Continuing the new development in the Third Basic Education Project, the Fourth
Basic Education Project will use measures of learning achievements in numeracy and
basic literacy as indicators of efficiency. It will improve and strengthen the process for
collecting information on learning achievement and using such information to monitor
educational quality and efficiency.
F. SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
37.   In summary, the economic and financial analysis undertaken during project
preparation and appraisal has: (a) documented the economic effects of investment in
basic education in poor areas; (b) resulted in the revision of provincial proposals to ensure
financial feasibility during project implementation and financial sustainability after
project completion; (c) reduced the burden of counterpart funding on poor counties and
thus the risk of inadequate counterpart funding during project implementation;



-127 -                      ANNEX24
(d) encouraged additional education funds from higher levels of government to poor
counties (thus resulting in increased resource mobilization and equality in compulsory
education); (e) provided additional empirical support for the continuation of the
innovation in student assistance; (f) provided the conceptual and empirical bases for the
piloting of a textbook rental scheme; (g) emphasized efficiency improvement and
Oincorporated activities and indicators to promote better utilization of personnel and non-
personnel resources; (h) modifying project design so that project components and
investment are more closely tied to project goals; and (i) achieved acceptance by Chinese
counterparts of the importance and usefulness of economic/financial analysis in project
design and appraisal.

following Credit effectiveness. The MTR would focus on progress made towards the
main project objectives as evidenced by achievements in the quantitative targets in civil
works; procurement of equipment, furniture and books; staff training; project costs;
counterpart funds; Credit disbursements; all the above in comparison with the Action
Plan targets. The MTR would also assess the progress made in reaching the project's
objectives regarding access/equity, quality and efficiency, as measured by the leading
indicators. Relevant lessons learnt during the first half of project implementation will be
incorporated in any appropriate adjustments made for the second half.
2.    Specifically, the MTR would assess the extent to which the following project
activities will have made progress compared with planned targets:
Access To Nine Year Compulsory Education (NYCE)
(a)   Civil works: total construction in sq. meters achieved in new buildings and
repairs and replacements of old or dangerous buildings, and total number
of student places provided.
(b)   Equipment and furniture procurement: total amount of equipment and
number of furniture sets procured, delivered and installed.
(c)   Student assistance program: the number of scholarships awarded, showing
the proportion of female and minority student beneficiaries, and status of
the pilot textbook rental scheme.
