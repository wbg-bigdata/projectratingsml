Kerangka Acuan (KA; ANDAL terms of reference) - a set of project-specific guidelines and criteria
which define the scope of studies and analyses that should be undertaken by proponents in their
preparation of an ANDAL.
Analisis Dampak Lingkungan (ANDAL; environmental impact assessment) - a detailed inpact
assessment report. It provides an analyses of the potentially significant environmental effects, both
positive and negative, generated by a project, and serves to identify and evaluate possible solutions.
Rencana Pengelolaan Lingkungan (RKL; enviromnental management procedures) - a specific guide
derived from an ANDAL that sets out the design and operating requirements for mitigating
enviromnental effects caused by proposed projects. The RKL may specify operating procedures,
compliance standards, activity responsibilities and schedules.



Rencana Pemantauan Linizkungan (RPL; environmental monitoring plan) - a specific guide derived
from an ANDAL that describes the means for monitoring project compliance with requirements and
procedures provided in the RKL as well as with established with environmental standards.
Kaiian Lingkun au (KL; initial environmental evaluation) - a preliminary level of environmental
studies that describe the existing conditions of an area, and types and magnitude of predicted project
impact. The KL further serves as a "decision document' that supports a determination of the
project's need for a detailed ANDAL study. For projects that do not require further study (and are
thus considered as exempt from the AMDAL process), the KL guides the preparation of the related
UKL and UPL .
Upava Kelola Lingigunean (UKL; enviromnental management action plan) - sirnilar in many respects
to a RKL. the UJKL is derived from a KL study and a determination that predicted project impacts
are not significant and can be managed by standard operating procedures. The UKL is operational
in scope and serves as a binding instrument for the proponent with regard to environmental
management. UKL and UPL documents do not form a part of the AMDAL process, as they are not
subject to evaluation by the responsible AMDAL commission but rather are under the direct
responsibility of the technical agency responsible for supervising the proposcd project activity.
Upava Pemantauan Linukunzan (UPL; enviromnental monitoring action plan) - similar in many
respects to a RPL. the UPL provides the monitoring counterpart to a project's UKL.

SUMMARY
Introduction: The Strategic Urban Road Infrastructure Project (SURIP) will assist the Government
of Indonesia (GOI) address existing capacity constraints on sections of the nation's primary road
network that are under the jurisdiction of the Directorate of Urban Road Development (BINKOT),
of the Directorate General of Highways (Bina Marga). Ministry of Public Works. With the main
objective of improving the flow of medium- and long-distance traffic, proposed SURIP projects will
involve critical road links along the North Java Transport Corridor (NJTC). the principal road
network between the country's two largest cities, Jakarta and Surabaya. This road network serves
a highly populated and developed region that plays a significant role in Indonesia's rapidly growing
economy.
Under SURIP, a range of road capacity expansion and new road construction activities will be
prepared and initiated over a five year period (1996-2001). supported by technical assistance and
procurement components to strengthen BINKOT's institutional capabilities. Five initial projects that
could be started in 1996/97 are now presented for envirommental review and funding appraisal.
Subsequent projects proposed for SURIP funding will be submitted for review on an annual basis.
Purpose and Organization: Impact assessments of the five initial SURIP projects have been
conducted in accordance with GOI enviromnental impact assessment (AMDAL) requirements and
World Bank Operational Directives 4.01 and 4.30. The purpose of these assessments were to identify
potential project impacts as well as measures to minimize, managed and monitor adverse impacts.
Based on these impact studies, this Sunmnary Environmental Assessment has been prepared to comply
with project appraisal requirements of the World Bank and is organized into the following seven
chapters:
*     Chapter 1 - project description:
*     Chapter 2 - environmental and social imnpact assessment framework;
*     Chapter 3 - existing enviromnental and social conditions;
*     Chapter 4 - significant environmental impacts;
*     Chapter 5 - analysis of alternatives;
*     Chapter 6 - environmental impact management and monitoring, and
*     Chapter 7 - social impact management and monitoring.
This summary report has been reviewed and approved by BINKOT and is based on project details
available at the time it was prepared and submitted to the World Bank (July/August 1995).
Significnt Findings: The initial SURIP projects are described as either expansions of existing roads
and/or completion of new roads for which almost all the right-of-ways (ROW) had previously been
obtained and substantial construction activities had been completed to date. While classified as urban
roads, these initial projects involve a total of 36 kIn of bypass alignments around five congested urban
areas, through rural to semi-urban enviromnents.
The selection criteria for these initial projects included ROW availability, compliance with regional
or local development plans, and minimal environmental or social impacts to allow for early
implementation. Potential project inpacts addressed in this summary report include:

*     air quality and noise impacts (all new road alignments);
*     social impacts and displaced residents (Cirebon and Weleri bypasses);
*      iniduced ribbon development and conversion of agricultural areas to other land uses (all new
road alignments);
*     increased flood hazards (along sections of the Semarang northern ring road, Kaliwungu and
Weleri bypasses); and
*     impacts on cultural facilities or resources (Cirebon and Pemalang bypasses, potentially all
projects where excavations or new alignments are required).
Significant economic benefits have been identified for these initial projects, as measured by direct
savings in vehicle operating costs and passenger travel time that would result from improved traffic
flows and travel speeds. These project benefits would translate into overall reductions in fuel use and
vehicular emissions. particularly along three congested urban routes where traffic levels in the range
of 20.000 vehicles (annual average daily traffic, AADT) is predicted to be reduced by 30 - 80% in
1998 by traffic diversions to the new bypass aligmnents.
Such traffic diversions will significantly increase vehicular emissions and noise levels along these new
bypass roads, but these impacts will primarily affect agricultural lands with low population densities.
Several public facilities (2 school buildings and a community health center) that are considered as
sensitive to high noise levels have been identified along these bypass aligmnents and recommended
mitigation measures include the provision of noise walls or relocation of these facilities. Noise studies
are recommnended to determine the level of project impacts and appropriate mitigation measures.
Specific measures to minimize potential impacts are provided in the environmental management and
monitoring action plans prepared in Bahasa Indonesia for all initial projects in accordance with Bina
Marga AMDAL screening procedures.
A priority concem during the assessment of each initial project was the potential for social impacts,
or resettlement, of any required ROW areas. As proposed, the bypass alignments serve to minimnize
social imnpacts by avoiding congested urban or human settlement areas. Based on current designs, an
estimated 7.5 ha of additional ROW will need to be acquired for the five initial SURIP projects.
Conducted surveys indicate that the social impacts of acquiring these areas are limited, and these
primarily involve six families (30 people) that could be displaced by the proposed widening of the
ROW for the Cirebon bypass to 22 meters. For this sensitive project, a resettlement action plan was
prepared in Bahasa Indonesia based on the findings of a detailed socio-economic survey. Additional
ROW areas and social impacts may be identified for these initial projects as final engineering design
features, particularly intersection improvements, are completed.
Under World Bank policies, the responsibility for all SURIP land acquisition and resettlement
requiremnents rests with the GOI, which places these activities under the direct jurisdiction of local
government authorities and agencies. To comply with World Bank Operational Directive 4.30
(Involuntary Resettlement), this summary report provides a general description of the land acquisition
and compensation procedures that will be followed under SURIP in accordance with Presidential
Decree No. 55 of 1993 on Land Acquisition for Public Interest/Welfare (Keppres 55(1993). These
GOI procedures provide for local consultations and negotiations ('musyawarah") in determnining the
amount of compensation or appropriate alternatives, as well as the means for dispute settlement and
legal appeal.
Limited details are presently available for future SURIP projects that could be inplemented after
1997. Potential projects presently include some 50 km of urban bypass roads and a flyover structure.
In general, these projects involve new road alignments for which ROW have not been acquired, which
may present significant enviromnental and social impacts. These future projects will require further
studies, including detailed environmental impact assessments (ANDAL) as currendy identified for the
Straegic Urban Road Infrastrucre Project

Cirebon and Kalibantcng flyover structurcs. All future projects will be evaluated according to Bina
Marga's AMDAL screening process, and documentation of all impact assessme2nts will be provided
to the World Bank as an integral part of each project's appraisal and approval process.
Main Points of the Summary Environmental Assessment:
*     focus of sunmuary report is on the five initial road projects, totalling 36 krn. that are now
proposed for SURIP funding;
*     limited environmental and social impacts have been identified for these initial projects. These
impacts are addressed in the initial environmental evaluation (KL), and environmental
management and monitoring action plans (UKL/UPL) prepared in Bahasa Indonesia for each
of these projects;
*     limited details are currently available on future SURIP projects, which may have significant
impacts due to their ROW requirements:
*     further impact studies will be required for the appraisal of these Puture projects. These
studies will be based on the Bina Marga AMDAL screening process and guidelines. Full
ANDAL studies will currently be required for urban flyover projects, including the Cirebon
and Kalibanteng flyovers;
-     the social impacts of required ROW land acquisitions should be minimnized as a basic design
consideration and unavoidable impacts will be addressed according to Keppres 55/1993. In
compliance with World Bank OD 4.30, resettlement action plans will be prepared by
BINKOT for any proposed projects that involve unavoidable social displacement, and
-     institutional responsibilities for project evaluation, implementation and monitoring are
described, specially the role of BINKOT Section AMDAL and the project managers (Pinpro).
To strengthen their roles, environmental training activities should be supported under SURIP.
Draft terms-of-references for these proposed activities will be presented during project
appraisal.

I     PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.1   Background of the SURIP Project
Roads are presently the dominant mode of transport in Indonesia. During the past 25 years.
investments in Indonesia's road transport sector have focussed primarily on the development of
national and regional-level facilities and services. These have included the development of an
extensive inter-urban network of primnary roads that play an increasing important role in the supply
and distribution needs of the rapidly growing economy.
Current initiatives to improve inter-urban road networks include activities supported under the World
Bank-funded Second Highway Sector Loan (HSL II), the OECF-funded Heavy Loaded Road
Improvement Project (HLRIP). the ADB-funded North Java Road Improvement Project (NJRIP), as
well as proposed programs for an expanded network of inter-urban toll roads. Under Repelita VI (the
GOI's central development plan for the period of 1994/95 -1998/99), proposed public outlays for road
infrastructure could account for some 67% of the nation's total transportation budget. As a result of
these completed or progranmned road improvements, the primary network of inter-urban roads is
generally expected to be able to handle the anticipated traffic growth between urban areas through the
late nineties.
Within this development framework of road transport, the Strategic Urban Road Infrastructure Project
(SURIP) has been proposed to assist the Government of Indonesia (GOI) in addressing current as well
as predicted constraints on primary urban roads. While the project's main objective is to improve
the flow of medium- and long-distance traffic, the proposed project may also provide significant
benefits to local traffic circulation and on adjacent urban activities. The SURIP project will be
implemented by the Directorate of Urban Road Development (BINKOT), which is under the
Directorate General of Highways (Binm Marga), Ministry of Public Works.
1.2   The Stategic Urban Road ifrastructure Project (SURIP)
The Strategic Urban Road Infrastructure Project (SURIP) will focus on the relief of bottlenecks in the
primary road network that fall under BINKOT's responsibility. In the process of identifying and
implementing a priority program of physical works over a five year period, SURIP will provide the
support considered necessary to strengthen the managerial and technical capabilities of BINKOT. The
three main components of SURIP are:
*     an urban roads component. which will identify and prepare a priority program  of
improvement projects for strategic urban roads within an area defined as the North Java
Transport Corridor (NJTC) that can be implemented over the next five years. Concurrently,
a strategic assessment will be conducted to identify and begin the preparation of strategic
urban road improvements throughout Indonesia within a ten-year time frame;
*     a technical assistance component, which will provide advisory support and financial
assistance to BINKOT and to local agencies in the establishment of a transport planning and
works preparation capacity, including assistance with improvement of guidelines and
procedures, institutional strengthening and training;
*     a procurement component, which will help prepare the procurement of professional services
needed for subsequent preparation activities under SURIP.
An initial group of projects have now been prepared for environmental review and funding appraisal
under the SURIP urban roads component. Implementation of these initial projects could be started
during the first two years of SURIP (1996/97). These proposed activities are referred to throughout
Strategic Urban Road Infrasructure Project

this report as year I projects. Figure I indicates the general location of these projects, in relationship
to several NJTC inter-urban road improvement programs. Subsequent projects that are prepared for
funding under SURIP will be presented to the Bank for their review an annual basis. These future
activities. which could be started after 1997, are referred to here as later year project.
1.3   Summary Descriptions of SURIP Year I Projects
Initial SURIP activities will concentrate on strategic urban road improvements within the North Java
Transport Corridor (NJTC). which can be defined in economic terms as Indonesia's principal road
transport network for medium- and long-distance traffic. In recent years, numerous projects have
been identified by various studies to address existing constraints and bottlenecks in the NJTC urban
road sections. The preparation status and feasibility of these projects was evaluated to prioritize
activities that could be addressed under SURIP. A short list of proposed projects that could be
finalized and implemented in the initial years of SURIP was then prepared for funding appraisal. As
selection criteria, these year I projects were in an advanced stage of preparation and did not present
any significant impediments to implementation, such as major environmental concerns or the need to
acquire substantial road right-of-ways (ROW).
The projects currently-proposed for SURIP funding involve capacity expansion activities (such as road
widening and intersection improvements) of existing roads as well as the construction of new bypass
roads and road structures (such as flyovers). While the environmental settings vary, these projects
are technically defined as 'urban" as they fall within the administrative boundaries of communities
with a population of 20,000 or more. These initial projects include:
*     widening of the Cirebon bypass with possible construction of two railroad flyovers;
widening of the Pemalang bypass;
*     completion of the Weleri bypass;
*     completion of the Kaliwungu bypass; and
*     widening of the Semarang northern ring road.
Typical project features include the provision for a divided, 4-lane asphaltic concrete roadway, with
associated intersection, bridge and drainage structure improvemnents. These initial projects involve
a total of 36 kan of road improvement and construction activities, summarized as:
*     upgrading of an existing road (Cirebon bypass and Semarang northern ring road);
*     completion of a new bypass where substantial work has been completed to date (Weleri and
Kaliwungu); and
*     the special case of the Pemalang bypass widening, where traffic will be re-routed as a result
of converting an existing 2-lane, 1-way road to a 4-lanes and 2-way operation.
Each of these projects has been reviewed in separate project preparation reports which discuss the
planning, traffic. engineering, environmental and economic evaluations that were conducted to
determine project suitability for early year implementation under SURIP. Typical construction
periods for these projects is about two years and 1998 has been utilized as the possible opening year
for purposes;of project economic evaluations.
1.4    Overview of Potental Later Year Projects
The preparation stage for later year projects (those that might be implemented in years 3 - 5 of
SURIP; 1998-2001) varies, and a prelimninary evaluation process is on-going. A tentative list of
possible later year projects which have been identified to date include:

NJTC and are located in either the province of West Java (Bekasi bypass), East Java (Lamongan
northem bypass) or Central Java (all other projects). Potential projects in other provinces of the
country may be identified during strategic assessment activities of SURIP, but will not be included
in the current project appraisal.
2     ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK
2.1    Purpose of the Suumary Environmental Assessment
This summary environmental assessment report addresses initial projects, generally referred to as year
I projects, that have been prepared for funding appraisal under the SURIP urban roads component.
It is intended to provide a overview of the project's regulatory framework as established by the
Indonesia's AMDAL System and World Bank procedures, which are briefly described in the
following sections.
2.2    The AMDAL System
Tlhe legal basis for enviromnental protection and management in Indonesia was originally formulated
in Republic Act (UU) No. 4 of 1982 and subsequently expanded by Government Regulation (PP) No.
29 of 1986 to establish the Indonesian environmental impact assessment (AMDAL; Analisa Mengenai
Damnpak Lingkungan) system. Recently, the AMDAL system was substantially modified by
Goverunent Regulation No. 51 of 1993 (PP 51/1993), which currently serves as the governing
legislation. These recent legislative changes have served to extend the AMDAL system from a
'factor to consider in the decision making process" (PP 29/1986) to an activity which is "recuired
as part of the decision making process' (PP 5111993).
While overall coordination of the AMDAL system rests with the Enviromnental Impact Management
Agency (Bapedal), the central and provincial levels of govermnent are directly responsible for
implementing these procedures. Bina Marga has recently developed and finalized an AMDAL
screening process for highway and road projects. This process is being directly applied to projects
proposed for SURIP funding. This screening process (Figure 2) provides a systematic approach to
environmental impact assessment, monitoring and management based on a project's type, scale and
location in relation to a range of sensitive environmental areas. For ali projects that may result in
significant enviromnental impacts and/or involve sensitive environmental areas, the preparation of an
ANDAL study (a detailed enviromnental impact assessment) is required. Such ANDAL studies
substantialy comply with World Bank requirements for project-specific environmental assessments.
The point of contact of SURIP with the AMDAL system is the environmental unit of Binkot, referred
to as the BINKOT Section AMDAL. The BINKOT Section AMDAL was established in 1992, and
it cunrently includes a staff of 10 persons organized into four subsections - planning and
programming; screening; evaluation; and monitoring and reports.

2.3     Land Acquisition and Compensation
An important consideration for implementing road projects in urbanized areas is the requirements for
acquisition of adequate right-of-ways (ROW), which may result in significant social impacts, including
relocation or resettlement. The GOI's land acquisition and compensation procedures were recently
revised by Presidential Decree No. 55 in 1993 on Land Acquisition for Public Interest/Welfare
(Keppres 55/1993). This new decree further defines the current procedures for valuation and
compensation, which are under the direct responsibility of the local governnent. The responsibility
for implementing and funding land acquisition as well as any resettlement requirements for public
works projects such as the SURIP is under the jurisdiction of local government at the level of
kodamadya (city or municipality) or kabupaten (alternately referred to as district or regency). In
situations where such budgets are not available, a request can be mnade by the local government to the
central government for a national budget allocation.
2.4     Application of World Bank Operational Directives 4.01 and 4.30
All projects proposed for World Bank funding are subject to environmental review and approval.
SURIP has been classified as a Category A type project' and is therefore subject to more stringent
environmental assessment and approval requiremnents, including the preparation of ANDAL studies
for sensitive projects. Based on current project descriptions, the World Bank requirenents that are
applicable to SURIP are Operational Directive (OD) 4.01, Environmental Assessment and OD 4.30,
Involuntary Resettlement.
An important concern in the environmnental review of proposed SURIP projects are social impacts
such as resettlement that may result from ROW land acquisition. Under World Bank policies (OD
4.30). the responsibility for land acquisition and recettlement rests with the borrower, the Government
of Indonesia. Based on recent draft reports of the Bank's Resident Staff in Indonesia (RSI). current
procedures stipulated in Keppres 5511993 provide a framework for land acquisition that is compatible
with the Bank's resettlement policies and OD 4.30.
For evaluating social impact or resettlement issues, a distinction is generally made concerning the
number of people that are "affected" as opposed to "displaced' by a proposed project. Two
definitions of "displaced' have been provided by the RSI to guide impact evaluations - occupants of
lot areas that would be reduced to less than 60 sq m or of structures 20 % or more of which would
have to be removed as a result of a project. In compliance with World Bank OD 4.30, resettlement
action plans will be prepared for any proposed projects that involve significant social impacts2 for
review and approval by the Bank.

3     EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOClAL CONDITIONS
3.1    The North Java Transport Corridor
The geographic focus of all initial projects proposed for funding under SURIP is the North Java
Transport Corridor (NJTC), which follows the gentle terrain of the northern coastline of the provinces
of West. Central and East Java. The NJTC is generally constricted to a relatively narrow coastal
plain created by the volcanic backbone of Java. The NJTC area has historically been a center for
human settlement. cultural and agricultural development. With only 7% of the country's land area,
the island of Java accounts for some 60% of the nation's population, resulting in population densities
that are considered as among the highest in the world today.
While the area's rich alluvial volcanic soils continue to provide a major agricultural base for the
nation, particularly for irrigated paddy rice, the transition towards urbanization and industrialization
has been a dominant trend and is occurring more rapidly on Java than elsewhere in the country. This
trend towards urbanization and industrial development of the NJTC is expected to continue and will
tend to be concentrated near established communities along maior transport routes, which include
road, rail and port facilities. To respond to these transport demands, major inter-urban road
improvemnent projects are on-going within the NJTC and an expanded system of toll roads will
foreseeably also serve the Corridor in the next 5 to 10 years.
3.2   Environmental Conditions of the Year 1 Project Areas
TopoWphv/Soils/GeoM: The terrain is level to gentle, with project elevations ranging from 1 to
10 m above sea level. Soils are typically derived from Quaternary alluvial deposits, with very high
clay content resulting in expansive characteristics. The entire island of Java can be described as
volcanically active. The project area is included within seismic zone 4 for basic shear coefficient of
design standards.
Hydrologv: Project alignments cross numerous small rivers, creeks, drainage and irrigation canals.
Water quality is described as poor due to intensive domestic, agricu::iral and industrial use and
discharges. Flooding is a significant seasonal concern in low laying coastal areas.
Meteorology and Air Oualitv: Climate is tropical and monsoonal, with lowland rainfall in the annual
range of 1,200 to 2,000 mm. The wet season generally lasts from December to May, though rains
do occur throughout the year. Typical wind conditions are described as light (< 5 mlsec). While
ambient air quality can visibly be described as good, available studies indicate significant concerns
for air pollution and noise in congested urban centers and along major roads.
Biological Resources: Based on field surveys, the proposed project areas do not involve sensitive
ecological habitats or areas with identified high biodiversity values. All areas along these project
aligmnents is devoted to intensive agricultural, residential, commercial and industrial land use.
Population and Human Settlements: The population density of Java is estimated at 815 persons per
square km. Population densities are generally higher in the NJTC, ranging from 1,110 persons/sq
km in Kabupaten Pemalang to 6,953 persons/sq man in Kodamadya Cirebon. In addition to traditional
settlement patterns, roadside (ribbon) development is common. The urban areas (and projected 1995
populations) included in the proposed year 1 projects are Cirebon (499,356), Pemnalang (164,697),
Weleri (46,823), Kaliwungu (53,721) and Semarang (1,693,341).

Transoort and Land Use Planning: The NJTC serves as the principal road link between the major
cities and hinterlands located along the highly developed and populated coastline of Northern Java.
The general project area has been identified as a major coastal development corridor according to the
National Planning Strategy for Spatial Development (Strategi Nasional Pengembangan Pola Tata
Ruang. SNPPTR) and available local development plans for the cities listed above.
Cultural Resources: Java has an exceptionally rich cultural history. In roadside areas, visible cultural
resources can include historic buildings, cemeteries and mosques. With the exception of the Cirebon
bypass, sensitive areas for potential archaeological and historical resources have not been identified
for the project areas to date. though limited information is available.
4    SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
4.1    Summary Impact Descriptions and Overview
Limited adverse environrmental and social impacts have been identified for the five proposed year 1
projects, which involve some 36 kn of bypass or ring roads around five congested urban areas.
These initial SURIP activities will serve to expand the capacity of the NJTC, the principal east-west
road axis of the highly developed and populated areas of northern Java. Significant economic benefits
have been identified for these projects, as measured by savings in vehicle operating costs and
passenger travel time. In addition, project benefits include enhanced road safety with the provision
of median dividers and intersection improvements. Local air quality would also benefit to the extent
that traffic flows are diverted outside of congested urban areas.
As one measure of imrpact, traffic forecasts for "with" and "without" project scenarios are provided
in Table 1 as calculated in average annual daily traffic (AADT) values, while predictions of the
vehicle composition are listed in Table 2. These forecasts indicate that traffic volumnes along two
proposed projects (Cirebon bypass and Semarang northem ring road) will remain the same under
either scenario, though traffic flows would be geatly improved as a project result. For the three
remaining projects, predicted diversions to these bypasses will reduce vehicular traffic in the
concerned urban areas by 30 - 80 %, in line with overall project objectives and local initiatives-

Based on reviews of currently proposed projects, Table 3 provides a summay of the environmental
parameters that were evaluated for relative importance or presence in relation to the year 1 projects
as well as the overall program. These parameters are discussed in the following sections and will be
addressed in enviromnental and social impact assessment process. Summary descriptions of the year
I projects and their identified environmental and social impacts are provided in Table 4 and support
a finding of minimal impact.
A priority concern during the assessment of each project was the potential for social impacts of any
required ROW areas. Land acquisition for year 1 project ROW's has been largely completed and
social impacts (as measured by the number of displaced residents) are predicted to be minimal and
primrily involve the Cirebon bypass. For the Cirebon bypass, a detailed survey indicates that
acquisition of the proposed 22 m ROW may invol-ve some 4 ha of adjacent land, portions of 39
existing structures and could displace 6 resident households (an estimated 30 people). Significant
social impacts have not been identified for any of the other proposed year 1 projects.

4.2   Application of the AMDAL Process
The AMDAL process will be applied to all proposed SURIP projects. This screening process ;3 based
on the project's location, type and scale, with consideration of a wide range of sensitive areas, to
determine the level of enviromnental studies and documentation that are necessary for project
approval. Based on these criteria, all year 1 projects can be classified as Category B according to
World Bank OD 4.01.  For these projects, an initial environmental evaluation (KL). and
enviromnental management and monitoring action plans (either revised RKLtRPL or new UKL/UPL)
have been prepared in Bahasa Indonesia. with copies furnished to the World Bank.
Due to their classification as urban flyovers and concerns for social impacts, a full ANDAL (detailed
EIA) study is reconunended for the Cirebon flyovers. A similar requirement for an ANDAL study
has been identified for the Kalibanteng flyover. The terms-of-reference (KA-ANDAL) for these
further studies has now been prepared to guide the services of outside consultants. Copies of these
documents, also prepared in Bahasa Indonesia, will be provided to the World Bank prior to project
appmisal.
4.3   Physical Environment
4.3.1 Soils.
During road construction, typical earthwork activities and impact concerns may include the need for
fill material or the requirement to dispose of excavated spoils. The proposed projects are locared on
the very gentle terrain of the coastal plain, limniting the amount of required earthworks. Under GOI
regulations, all fill material, selected embankment and aggregate must be obtained from permitted
quarry sites. which are under the jurisdiction of local government agencies at the district (kabupaten)
level. The project contractor is directly responsible for selecting the licensed site that is used and for
any required site rehabilitation.
The proposed projects will be constructed on embankments requiring the use of fill material. Typical
quantities required for year 1 projects are in the range of 150,000 to 200,000 cu m of common
embankment and 50,000 to 100,000 cu m of selected embankment. These quantities are considered
relatively moderate and ample supplies are available in the area. Any related environmental impacts
can be addressed by current standard operating procedures of Bina Marga. In some areas, soil
derived from drainage and cormnon excavations that are unsuitable for road construction (such as
clay) will have to be disposed of. As the quantities are generally small (in the range 10,000 to 40,000
cu m), the impacts are not expected to be significant and can also be addressed by Bina Marga's
standard operating procedures.
4.3.2 Flooding.
The general project area of the NJTC has a history of flood events. The construction of a road on
elevated fill could restrict the flow of storm waters and increase upstream flooding levels. The
impervious surface areas of the completed roads would also contribute to increase local run-off during
storm events. All year 1 projects, with the exception of the Cirebon bypass, are located downstream
of the urban area or town that they bypass. These proposed projects will be provided with bridges
and drainage structures (box culverts) at least as large the existing upstream structures water,
minimizing the risk of increased flood levels. Three of the five year 1 projects involve the widening
of an existing road, which will serve to increase the amount of impervious roadway surface to be
accommodated by local drainage systems.

A unique combination of local drainage problems related to low project elevation (near sea level), soft
soil conditions and potential for subsidence have been identified along the easternmost section of the
Semarang northern ring road. Proposed widening of this road section could also involve an existing
drainage canal. Further geotechnical and drainage design studies are being conducted for this portion
of the alignment to determine the extent of these identified problemns. In future project areas that are
prone to flooding, the design engineer should be required to undertake a hydrological study in
accordance with current Bina Marga standards, or the recommended Urban Drainage Guidelines and
Technical Design Standards (La Groupe AFH, 1994). At a minimum, the storm flow capacity of all
bridges. box culverts and road drainage channels should be in accordance with these standards. This
will minimize potential flood impacts.
4.3.3 Ecology.
The proposed road alignments involve areas that have been historically devoted to agricultural,
residential or commnercial use. Widening of the Cirebon bypass and Semarang northern ring road will
involve the removal of existing landscaping and coummon shade trees along several kilometers of these
alignments. Due to their proximity to or passage through urban areas, the surveyed projects are
considered as very unlikely to impact on any sensitive eco-systems such as the habitats of rare or
endangered species, forest land, or conservation areas. This will be further reviewed during the
AMDAL screening process required for future project to ensure that they do not impact on any such
area or habitat. None of the proposed year I projects imnpact on any ecologically sensitive areas.
4.3.4  Air Ouality.
Air einissions from road vehicles are a major source of air pollution. Vehicular traffic contributes
a high proportion of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrous oxides and particulates. Emissions of
carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons generally decrease as vehicle speeds increase. Stop and go traffic
in a congested system typically produces the highest levels of emissions. Road improvements, such
as the proposed SURIP projects, that allow traffic to flow more freely will tend to reduce vehicular
emissions of air pollutants. As an example of possible project improvement, a forecast of 1998 traffic
speeds along the Cirebon bypass "without" project are in the range of 33 km/hour (peak traffic) to
39 km/hour (off-peak traffic), while predicted 'with' project speeds are 57 km/hour (peak traffic) to
58 1m/hour (off-peak traffic). By year 2017. "without" project speeds during peak traffic would
sharply decrease to 21 km/hour, while corresponding 'with" project speed remain about 52 kmthour.
Recent air quality sampling at the proposed site of the Kalibanteng flyover, a high traffic section of
NJTC. indicated that the existing air pollution levels were lower than national standards as for all
tested parameters except hydrocarbons and particulates as shown in Table 5.

The Kalibanteng Circle is a busy intersection (1994 traffic levels of 40,000 vehicles a day) with slow
and accelerating traffic, pollution levels there are likely to be significantly higher than in the vicinity
of any of the proposed year I projects. The construction of the proposed SURIP projects is predicted
to reduce ambient pollution levels in congested urban areas by improving traffic flow or, in the case
of bypass alignments, by diverting traffic outside of these highly populated areas.
The expected air quality impacts of year I projects are generally described in Table 6. Cumulatively,
SURIP projects will have a positive impact on air quality. Other than by improving traffic flows, the
reduction of pollution levels can only be achieved by implementing effective emission controls
standards, using unleaded fuels and restricting heavily polluting vehicle types, such as those with two-
stroke engines. There is no effective means of designing SURIP projects to ensure that ambient air
quality standards are met. Where existing facilities, such as schools and hospitals, are located close
to proposed projects, consideration will be given to moving them.

4.3.5   Noise.
Noise is an inportant parameter for evaluating the impact of road projects, particularly projects in
built-up areas or near sensitive facilities such as hospital or schools. While tolerance to noise is often
a culumral issue, experience elsewhere indicates such tolerance is reduced as living standards improve.
National noise standards have not yet been established in Indonesia but a set have been proposed and
are shown in Table 7. In the absence of national standards, basic policy issues need to be addressed
on how noise impacts can be responded to under SURIP, specially at the project evaluation stage.

Recent noise levels measured at the Kalibanteng Circle provided 24-hour average values of 75.5
decibels (as measured by dB(A); China Engineering Consultants, 1994). The equivalent noise level
(L.). the standard measurernent of noise impact, would be somewhat higher.  Equally high noise
levels were also recorded along several other NJTC sections as part of this same study. The results
of a recent noise modelling study (Lotti & Associati, 1994) indicate that the widening of the NJTC
road from two to four lanes will increase noise levels 20 m from the road centerline by between 0.2
to 3.2 dB(A) in 2014, an insignificant increase in ambient levels. This study noted that noise levels
will be as high at night as during the day due to the high volume of buses and indicated that
residences or other 'sensitive receptors":
*      near an existing 2-lane bypass to be widgied to 4-lanes will not be subject to a significant
increase in noise but will continue to suffer from high noise levels;
*      along roadside urban areas where traffic volumes will be reduced as a project result will
benefit from a slight but not significant decrease in current noise levels; or
-      near a new bypass will suffer a significant impact from the noise generated by the road.
Qualitative noise impacts of the year I projects are included in Table 6, with particular concem for
a school building and community health clinic/hospital located along the Weleri bypass alignment.
Several mitigation measures have been considered, such as noise walls along these two areas or
relocating these facilities. The evaluation of these and future mitigation alternatives should be based
on actual noise studies. For example, the maximum noise reduction (attenuation) that can be achieved
by as properly designed noise barrier is in the range of 15-18 dB(A). and the resulting noise levels
may still be too high for these types of facilities based on international standards.
4.4    Human Environment
4.4.1 Population.
The proposed bypass roads will compliment local initiatives to divert heavy vehicle, through traffic
outside of congested urban areas. Cumulatively, the SURIP projects are designed to address existing
road transport bottlenecks to provide critical links in the plan to improve the inter-urban road
transport network of the NJTC, which is supportive of the rapidly expanding economy of Indonesia.

4.4.2 Land Use and Local Development Planninz.
The construction of the year 1 projects will require some 7.5 ha of agricultural and roadside areas
for ROW. as sunmmarized in Table 3. By providing access to currently undeveloped land, new road
aligrnents, or 'greenfield" projects, that are proposed under SURIP may encourage ribbon
development and the conversion of agricultural land to other uses.
All proposed year I project activities are in compliance with available local development plans. Any
new construction activities along these roads would require planning and building approval by the
local authorities, and existing spatial land use rcgulations protect irrigated paddy rice areas as an issue
of national priority. Various engineering and design measures are also available to rontrol or limit
access to these bypass aligrnents. These measures include the provision of ROW fencing. barriers
or drainage canals that would allow pedestrian (farmer) access but physically restrict vehicle access.
It should be noted that in the case of the year I projects which involve the widening of an existing
bypass, the overall lcvel of development along these former greenfield alignments has been limited
and many adjacent areas have remained as rice paddies. This reflects the critical role of local
govemrnment agencies in controlling land use in areas adjacent to these roads.
4.4.3 Economics and Road Transport Planning.
In the short term, the construction of the SURIP projects will employ a significant number of workers
whose spending in the local communities will produce an economnic multiplier effect to the direct
benefit of these communities. In the long term, the SURIP projects can be seen in the context of an
overall improvement of the road transportation network of Indonesia, which will generate significant
economic benefits. Major inter-urban road investments in the proposed project areas are guided by
the recomrnendations of the ADB-funded NJTC study as well as components of the OECF-funded
Heavy Loaded Road Improvement Project (HLRIP). The proposed year 1 projects will provide a
portion of the urban improvements required to achieve the overall regional transport goals of these
studics, and are consistent with their plans and recommendations.
4.4.4 Land Acquisition.
Land acquisition requirements for road ROW can have a significant socio-economic impact on
affected residents and businesses. An important criteria in the selection of year 1 projects was that
the required ROW was largely available and the need for land acquisition would be minimal. As a
direct result. the land acquisition requirements for the proposed year 1 projects are described as
limited and involve a total area estimated at 7.5 ha. Land acquisition requirements for later year
projects will generally be significantly greater, since many of these may involve new road alignments.
To the extent possible. "land consolidation' practices will be applied to obtain these new ROW areas.
to limit social impacts and provide for exchanges of locally available public land.
All ROW land acquisition requirements will be in accordance with all current GOI regulations
(Keppres 55/1993), which provide established procedures for community consultations and legal
recourse in setting local land compensation values. Bui!ding valuations will be based on current local
rates as established by Dinas Cipta Karya. Under Indonesian laws, compensation is generally not
provided for lost business. Based on past experience and results of a detailed socio-economic survey
conducted for the Cirebon bypass, most affected businesses and residents would be able "move back"
and rebuild their structures and conimercial activities outside of the new project ROW. Significant
appreciation in real estate values typically occus as a direct result of completing a new road project,
to the economic benefit of local land owners.
4.4.5 Relocation and Resettlement.
A basic consideration in selecting the year 1 projects was the absence or minimal need for any
Srrategic Urban Road Infrastructure Project
Summary Enviromnenal Assessment                                                     17



rclocation or resettlement. The additional ROW land requirements for the proposed year I projects
would include portions of some 45 - 50 conunercial and residential buildings, involving an estimated
total building area of 1,000 - 2,000 sq m. These roadside buildings are mostly of temporary
construction (light, wood frame materials) and can be readily rebuilt or moved outside of the new
ROW boundary. As a result, the proposed year I projects do not involve significant relocation and
resettlement issues.
The most significant concerns identified during the initial screening activities were possible
resettlement issues raised by the widening of the Cirebon bypass. To address these issues, a detailed
socio-economic survey was conducted of all existing structures and residents within the originally
proposed 38 m ROW area. Based on this survey, Table 8 provides a summary of the building areas
that would be affected by a reduced 22 m ROW. Including all residential structtres that are located
20% or more within the proposed ROW boundary, a total of 6 families, or about 30 people, may be
displaced by this project based on current project designs. No relocation or resettlement requirements
have been identified to date for the other proposed year 1 projects.

Date of Jw seisd  My s 95
Based on initial field surveys and available project information, an estimated 50 buildings could also
be affected by the expanded 45 m ROW proposed for the Cirebon flyovers, which would not be
implemented until at less year 2 of SURIP. A detailed ANDAL study will be conducted for this
proposed project to fully assess and address these issues.
4.4.6 Social Impacts.
SURIP projects are intended to address a pressing social need for an adequate urban road transport
network. The economic analyses conducted for the year 1 projects support the conclusion that
significant benefits (positive impacts) can be attributed to these activities. The proposed year 1
projects involve expansions of existing roads or, in the case of the Weleri and Kaliwungu bypasses,
comnpletion of projects for which the alignments had already been established and construction
activities initiated. These available ROW areas were reportedly acquired in compliance with existing
GOI regulations and procedures. Land consolidation practices, which generally minimize any social
impacts, were reportedly used in acquiring ROW for the proposed Pemalang, Weleri and Kaliwungu
bypasses. Formal documentation of these past ROW acquisition activities has not been made available
to date for review.
The construction of new roads may serve to divide existing communities. This problem can be
relieved by providing adequate and safe means of pedestrian crossing and access, with consideration
for existing paths and local habits. This is issue is of particular relevance to the Weleri bypass, where
two rural communities will be split. Current project designs for this project provide for a pedestrian
and vehicle underpass to minimize these social impacts.

4.4.7 Public Safety.
Provision of urban bypasses will almost certainly contribute to reducing accident rates. Society will
benefit in terms of lives and injuries saved, reductions in damage to vehicles and property, and
reduced hospital and police costs. Historically, the number of reported accidents in Indonesia has
generally followed the increase in number of vehicles. Available statistics on traffic accidents in the
NJTC indicate that some 30% of these accidents were head-on collisions. Such types of accidents
could be significantly reduced as a result of medium dividers provided in the project designs. Traffic
control and provision of temporary diversion routes during construction activities are provided for
under Bina Marga standard operating procedures and tender documents.
4.4.8 Cultural Resources.
Cultural resources can include a range of sites, structures and practices that have unique archaeologic,
historic, religious or social value. Based on current project designs, recent field surveys and available
information, no significant impacts on cultural resources have been identified to date for the proposed
year I projects. Procedures governing the chance discovery of archaeologic or historic artifacts and
sites during any project excavation activities are provided by Republic Act (UU RI) No. 5/1992 and
included in standard Bina Marga tender documents.
5     ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
5.1    Alternatives to the Project Within the North Java Transport Corridor
The North Java Transport Corridor (NJTC) connects Indonesia's two largest cities via a 750 km
desely populated corridor containing numerous large and small towns and much of the country's
industrial capacity. The provision of an adequate transportation network is therefore a key element
in the development of the corridor and the nation as a whole. Alternative analyses provided by the
ADB-funded North Java Corridor Transport Study and the OECF-funded Heavy Loaded Road
Improvement Project established the NJTC as the preferred route within the Corridor.
Alternative transportation modes are available, namely rail, sea and air as well as road. Within the
road sector there are alternative strategies to serve the road transportation needs of the corridor,
namely the proposed extension of toll roads to connect Jakarta with Surabaya versus the improvement
of the capacity of the primary arterial road network connecting the two cities. SUREP is an element
of the latter strategy, and incorporates the findings of available road transport studies. The future
development of a expanded toll road system will complement the current development of the primary
arterial road system but does not replace it.
Traffic along the NJTC has rapidly increased since 1975: at average annual rate of 6.4% in West
Java, 5.8 % in Central Java and 6.8% in East Java. Motor vehicle ownership has also been increasing
since 1981 at average annual rate of 9.5% for cars, 7.8% for buses and 5.4% for trucks. Annual
traffic growth rates by vehicle type used in SURIP for forecasting normal traffic growdt from 1995
to 2003 was 6% per year, and 5% per year thereafter to 2018.
The development of the different modes of transportation can be seen as complimentary rather than
alterntive choices. The challenge is develop all the modes of transportation at a rate fast enough to
meet Indonesia's rapicly expanding surface transport needs. This issue is being addressed in terms
of an overall national transportation strategy. Alternatives for consideration are therefore limited to
the selection and prioritization of road projects to be supported by SURIP and alternative alignments
and designs to be considered for each.

5.2   Project Specific Alternatives
Project specific alternatives that were generally considered during the evaluation process included:
*     do-minimum alternative;
*     new alignment alternatives;
*     improvements to existing traffic diversion routes; and
*     railroad crossing alternatives.
A basic consideration in evaluating these initial projects was that they involved the widening of
existing road alignments or completion of projects that had already been started and for which a ROW
had been already established. Based on discussions with field engineers, these alignments were often
selected so as to avoid developed areas and human settlements. The principal choice was therefore
between the "with' and 'without" project scenarios following these existing alignments. The
"without" project, do-minimum alternative would lead to increasing traffic congestion and
environmental degradation in the urban areas through which existing routes pass until such time that
these proposed projects can be completed using local funding resources.
From an enviromnental perspective, important selection criteria for year 1 projects included:
*     proposed activities were consistent with local or regional development plans;
a     land acquisition for ROW was more or less complete; and
*     significant environmnental and social impacts were not present.
In evaluating future projects for SURIP funding, it is expected that enviromnental issues will play an
increasingly important role in the alternatives analysis due to scheduling, cost and administrative
considerations in addressing significant project impacts under current AMDAL, land acquisition and
resettlement procedures. In accordance with GOI and World Bank requirements, all future projects
will be subject to the AMDAL screening process (Figure 2). Whenever significant issues are
involved, these projects will be subject to the preparation of an ANDAL, a detailed level of
enviromental impact studies which directly addtfss project specific alternatives.
5.3    Alternative Design and Construction Considerations
To the extent possible, the design considerations of these year 1 projects have served to mininmize
potential impacts by avoiding congested urban areas. Various other design and construction
alternatives were considered in the process of evaluating each year 1 project proposal. These
typically included:
*     number of travel lanes;
*     cross-section alternatives;
*     road access control;
*     provisions for pedestrians and unmotorized vehicles;
*     intersection configuration alternatives; and
*     staged project implementation.
In this process, significant design changes were made to minimize potential impacts, particularly
social impacts related to ROW land acquisition. For exawple, a reduction in the proposed ROW for
the Cirebon bypass from the original 38 m width to the present 22 m width significantly reduced the
number of residents that might be affected from an estinated 601 people to less than 50 people.
Bina Marga's "Standard Specifications for Geomnetric Design of Urban Roads", dated March 1992,
were reviewed and minmum geometric standards were developed. Typical cross-sections, which are
primarily controlled by ROW restrictions, were developed and agreed for these year 1 projects.
Based upon BINKOT's experience, the 1992 standard for normal cross slope was revised from 2.0%

to 2.5% (to improve surface runoff) and the maximum grade was revised from 5.0% to 4.0% (to
accomumodate heavy vehicle traffic). With consideration of available ROW and the adapted geometric
design standards, typical cross-sections were prepared for a 4-lane divided highway standard, with
a design speed of 60 kml/hour. Proposed pavement structures will be comprised of asphalt concrete
(AC), asphalt treated base (ATB), and aggregate classes A and B over select subgrade. Clay is the
dominant soil type along most alignments and the expansive characteristics of these soils must be fully
considered for each project. For the eastermnost section of the Semarang northern ring road, the
particular problem of subsidence, low elevation (near sea level) and flooding has been identified and
further geotechnical studies are being conducted.
6     ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING
6.1   Proposed Year I Projects
Important selection criteria for the proposed year 1 projects included the absence of significant
environmental and social impact problems according to the AMDAL process. In brief, these selected
projects were in an advanced state of project preparation, involved existing roads or alignments. ROW
areas were largely available. significant relocation or resettlement issues were not involved and
sensitive environmental issues were not present.
Iitial envirommental assessment activities have served to document existing conditions and 'screen"
sensitive issues and potential problems of each proposed year 1 project as summarized in Tables 3
and 4. To fully address these issues. environmental management and monitoring action plans (revised
RKLIRPL or new UKLtUPL documents), supported by an initial environmental evaluation report
(Kajian Lingkungan. KL) have been prepared for all proposed year I projects. These documents will
wil serve as the basis for environmental management and monitoring activities during project
implementation. It is recommended that copies be provided together each project's tender documents.
6.2   Potential Later Year Projects
Limited details are currently available on potential later year projects.  Preliminary project
descriptions and initial enviromnental reviews of these later year activities will be provided to the
World Bank as part of project appraisal documents. Each of these projects will be subject to
environmental reviews and approvals in accordance with GOI and World Bank requirements. Based
on the type, scale and location of each project, two levels of environmental studies will be conducted
for later year projects in accordance with Bina Marga's AMDAL screening process:
*     for projects that may involve limited impacts, KL and UKL/UPL documents will be prepared;
*     for projects that may involve significant impacts, ANDAL and RKL/RPL documents will be
prepared.
These environmental studies will be fully documented by BINKOT for submission to the World Bank
as part of each project's preparation and appraisal process. Based on current descriptions of potential
latr year activities, no projects will be exempted from these environmental review procedures.
6.3   Institutional Responsibilities
As the implementing agency, BINKOT is responsible for ensuring that appropriate environmental
management and monitoring measures are provided for each project. These activities will directly
involve the BINKOT Section AMDAL for project evaluation and monitoring, and the respective
project manager (Pinpro) during project implementation. The organizational framevwork for projects
to be implemented under SURIP is provided in Figure 5. Local institutions involved in project
monitoring activities include the Provincial Living Environmental Bureau (Biro Linghamgan Hidup),
under the Office of the Governor.

These responsibilities will place considerable demands on the limited staff and resources of BINKOT
Secdon AMDAL. To support their important project role in environmental impact assessment,
management and monitoring, technical training and professional support activities have been proposed
under SURIP's technical assistance component. The World Bank is currently in the process of
finalizing the TOR for an institutional strengthening project which should involve the BINKOT
Section AMDAL as well as Bina Marga's Directorate of Road Planning Development (Bipran). Final
details on this training and operational support project are not yet available and additional. SURIP
specific activities will be proposed at the time of project appraisal.
6.3.2  The Role of the Project Manager.
For project implementation, a project manager (Pemimpin Proyek, Pinpro) is assigned by the
provincial office of Bina Marga (Dinas Bina Marga) to provide on-site project supervision. In
addition to his or her primary role as the field engineer and construction manager. the Pinpro is
directly responsible for ensuring that the procedures and conditions stipulated in the approved
environmental management and monitoring action plans are followed. Additional responsibilities of
the Pinpro include their role in implementing land acquisition and compensation procedures. Due to
the critical role that the Pinpro plays during project implementation, proposed termns-of-reference for
possible environmental training activities that could be conducted under the SURIP technical assistance
component are also being prepared and will presented at project appraisal.
6.4 Enviromnental Management and Monitoring Action Plans
Enviromnental management and monitoring action plans (revised RKL/RPL or new UKL/UPL
docurnents) have been prepared in Bahasa Indonesia for all proposed year 1 projects. The purpose
of these documents is to define the regulatory framework for environmental management and
monitoring, based on local environmental conditions and types of project impacts. These action plans
are summarized as matrices in Tables 9 and 10.
These environmental management and monitoring action plans are operational in scope and will serve
as binding contract instnments together with each project's tender documents. For this purpose,
copies will be provided to each Pinpro, project contractor and all other responsible parties listed in
Tables 9 and 10. An important consideration in reviewing project bid documents will be the
provision for line items and budgets corresponding to the specific contractor responsibilities for
evironmental managernent and monitoring. Additional requirements for project reporting and
monitoring may be established by the Ministry of Public Works' AMDAL Central Commission for
environmentally sensitive projects.  In addition to each Pinpro, the standard distribution of
environmental management and monitoring plans includes the regional AMDAL commissions, the
concemred local government agencies and the provincial planning departnent.

7     SOCIAL IMPACT MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING
7.1   Proposed Year I Projects
Minimal social impacts, as measured by the number of people displaced or the need for relocation
or resettlement, have been identified for the proposed year 1 projects. The screening and design
criteria for these initial projects specifically included thesc concmrns, and unavoidable impacts are
addressed in the environmental management and monitoring plans prepared for each year 1 project.
A primary form of impact management for these initial projects will be cash compensation for the
estimated 7.5 hectares of additional ROW areas. Prelirninary estimates of ROW land and building
compensation costs have been prepared for project appraisal. Actual costs will need to be determined
based on mapping surveys, consultations and negotiations to be conducted by concemed local
government agencies.
7.1.1 Cirebon Bypass.
As a pilot AMDAL project, detailed social impact studies were conducted for the Cirebon bypass due
to the extent of residential and commercial development bordering this alignment. These activities
included the preliminary mapping and identification of 371 existing structures within the originally
proposed 38 m ROW with socio-economic and perception surveys completed for the 131 families
residing in this area. These survey findings indicate that:
     nearness to work was the main reason for living along the bypass (81% of 131 respondents);
     most households have lived in this ROW area for over 20 years (44%);
-     most households have land ownership/hak milik rights (67%);
     most households are aware of the project (82%);
-     nearly all support it (97%) if compensation is based on market value; and
-     most would move back to their properties outside of new ROW (80%), though 20% would
move to another place if a nearby resettlement area was made available.
These survey results and 1: 1,000 scale base maps have been compiled in the resettlement action plan
prepared for the Cirebon bypass. As a pilot project, the study methods, results and recommendations
for the Cirebon bypass will have general SURIP application. As a means of impact management,
subsequent design changes reduced the proposed number of lanes from 6 to 4, and the corresponding
ROW required from 38 m to 22 m. These design changes will serve to minimize the social imnpacts
of ROW land acquisition for this sensitive project. Current land acquisition procedures for this
proposed road project are provided in Figure 6, while Figure 7 provides an indicative schedule of
these pre-construction activities.
7.2   Potential Later Year Projects
Most ROW areas for later year projects have not been acquired and these ROW requirements may
involve more significant social impacts and resettement issues. Preliminary project descriptions and
initial social impact reviews will be provided to the World Bank as part of project appraisal
documents. Each of these projects will be subject to further social impact reviews and approvals in
accordance with GOI and World Bank requirements.
In compliance with World Bank OD 4.30, resettlement action plans would be prepared by BINKOT
for any proposed projects where displacment is unavoidable. These plans will detail project
requirements and time-bound procedures for land acquisition and resettlement, consultation, property
and building surveys, building demolition and restoration, available compensation and resettlement
alternatives, and all monitoring and evaluation activities. SURIP funding of these later year projects

will be conditional on the Bank's approval of these resettlement action plans, and full documentation
of all land acquisition and resettlement activities.
7.2.1 Land Acquisition Procedures.
Recent reports3, local consultations, and household surveys along the Cirebon Bypass all indicate that
cash compensation as opposed to fonnal resettlement, will generally be the prefered option for land
and building acquired for ROW areas. The GOI's land acquisition and compensation procedures to
be applied under SURIP are currently governed by Presidential Decree No. 55 of 1993 (Keppres
5511993)4, which stipulate that community consultations ("musyawarah") will be conducted to reach
agreement on the form and amount of compensation, and that alternative fonns of compensation will
be made available.  Additional measures to limit the social impacts of ROW  land acquisition
requirements for later year projects are provided for under Keppres 55/1993. and include:
*      land acquisition must now be linked to a spatial plan;
*      improved basis for determining the amount of compensation;
*     possible forms of compensation can include options of cash compensation, substitute land,
resettlement, a combination of these three or other forms of agreed compensation;
*      more equitable procedures that allow for dispute settlement and further appeal procedures
beyond the level of the Provincial Governors; and
*      land owners can take their disputes to an administrative court if official procedures are not
followed.
According to Keppres 55/1993, the monetary value of land compensation will be based on current
prices, with consideration of the sales value of tax object (Nilai Jual Obyek Pajak, NJOP). Existing
site improvements and buildings are separately valued according to rates established by the provincial
offices of the Directorate General of Human Settlements (Dinas Cipta Karya). Grievance procedures
for dispute settlement, administrative and legal appeals are provided for under Keppres 55/1993.
Based on draft reports of the Bank's Resident Staff in Indonesia5, these current GOI procedures
provide a framework for land acquisition that is compatible with World Bank resettlement policies
(OD 4.30). The principle objective of these of these policies is to ensure that those displaced by a
projcct should be at least as well off, if not better off, than they would have been without the project.
7.3    Resettlement Principles of the SURIP Program
In line with GOI reguations and World Bank policies, the resettlement principles that will guide the
SURIP program are:
*     projects will be selected and designed in a manmer that will avoid or minimize resettlement;
*     compensation for land areas acquired for project ROWs will be valued at replacement costs,
with consideration of the sales value of the tax object (NJOP) and local surveys to be
conducted during the preparation of each resettlement action plan;

*     the compensation value of project affected buildings and site improverents will be calculated
at replacement costs according to provisions of the respective resettlement action plan.
*     displaced families will be allowed to retain existing building materials and relocation
assistance will be provided;
*     as needed, resettlement sites will have sufficient infrastructure and public facilities;
*     assistance will be provided to support livelihood activities at the new site; and
*     consultations will be held with the displaced families prior to resettlement.
These general principles will be defined in accordance with Keppres 55(1993 as loan agreements
during project appraisal and further developed in the form of an operational manual during follow-up,
project preparation activities.
7.4   Institutional Responsibilities
Institutional, implementation and monitoring responsibilities will be clearly defined in the resettlement
action plans that will be prepared for SURIP projects involving social displacement. Under World
Bank policies (OD 4.30). the responsibility for land acquisition and resettlement rests with the GOI.
In accordance with Keppres 55/1993. this responsibility is placed under local government authorities
and the currently proposed projects will directly involve 12 different local governments in three
provinces. The GOI will accord priority to the allocation of sufficient funds for the purpose of
acquiring ROW and any resettlement requirements of the project. For projects that have substantial
ROW requirements, Keppres 55/1993 also stipulates that a Land Procurement Team will be formed
to facilitate the land acquisition process, and these teams will include the:
     FHead of Kabupaten or Kotamadya;
*     Head of Kabupaten or Kotamadya Land Office;
*     Head of Land and Building Tax Agency;
*     Head of the local government agency in charge of buildings;
*     Head of the local govermnent agency in charge of agriculture;
*     Sub District Head (Camat);
*     Head of Village (Lurah);
*     Assistant to the Local Goverrnment Secretary in charge of Public Administration or Head of
Public Administration at the Office of the Governor (Bupati)ICity Mayor (Walikota), as
secretary I;
*     Head of Section at the Kabupaten or Kotamadya Land Office, as secretary II; and
*     Concerned Project Manager (Pinpro).
Documentation of all land acquisition activities will be provided to the provincial agrarian office,
Office of the Governor or Mayor according to project jurisdiction. For monitoring purposes, each
project manager (Pinpro) will be required to maintain a complete set of these documents. to include
cadastral maps, physical descriptions of house locations and building type, owners' name, tenure
status, and evidence of payment. Summary reports of all land acquisition activities will be provided
to the BINKOT Section AMDAL to support their central role in project monitoring. Draft terms of
reference for the SURIEP general consultant will be presented at project appraisal and wfil include
specific project monitoring and information management responsibilities.

8     LOCAL CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION
8.1  Program Preparation Activities
Local consultations have bcen conducted within the Indonesian political and cultural framework,
which typically involves two stages of consultations - preliminary. project development consultations
at an inter-agency, local government level; followed by community consultations ("musyawarah")
which are conducted by local officials. During the course of program preparation and field surveys.
extensive meetings and consultations were held with local officials and governmemnt departments to
discuss the rationale and current status of each project. These consultations have included city.
district and provincial government officials; representatives of concerned planning and public works
departments; project managers (Pinpros) of each area; members of local land procurement
conmnittees, and officials of related transport sectors (railways, ports, bus terminals). A summary
list of projcct contacts is provided in Annex 2. During these initial assessments and preparaLion of
the AMDAL documents for year I projects, informal discussions were also held with residents and
businesses located along each alignment. Thie proposed year 1 projects involve the completion of
activities that have been in progress for several years, but the participants and outcome of previous
community meetings and consultations were not recorded.
The proposed projects have a high level of local govermnent support and compliment on-going
initiatives and transport planning measures to divert heavy vehicle, through traffic outside of
congested urban areas. Residents and businesses located along the road alignments are generally
aware of the proposed projects from information provided to them by local officials and project
managers. Project ROW requirements. compensation values for affected land and building areas.
and availibility of local budgets to fund ROW costs were the primary environmental issues raised
during these program preparation consultations. Based on available reports, such issues are common
for road capacity expansion projects along the North Java Transport Corridor. These sensitive issues
remain to be resolved and will need to be fully addressed as part of the follow-up activities, project
appraisal documents and project-specific resettlement action plans. During the eight month program
preparation period covered by this report, no opposition to the proposed projects has been noted or
reported other than the identified concern for land compensation based on market values.
Cireboo Bypass: As a formal means of consulting local residents on resettlement issues, detailed
socio-economic/perception surveys were conducted for 131 households along the Cirebon Bypass that
could be affected by the project. The number of residents -.id businesses identified in these surveys
contributed to design changes that reduced the proposed ROW width from 38 to 22 meters to
minimize the number of residents and businesses that would be displaced.
These survey results indicate that most respondents (82%) l'xve been infonned of the project by local
officials and nearly all (97%) support it if compensation or their affected properties is based on
market value. Cash compensation is the preferred altmrnative (80%), although 20% of the
respondents reported that they would be willing to move if . nearby resettlement area was available.
Three possible sites were identified in subsequent discussions with the city government of Cirebon,
including counmercial areas within the new bus terminal located along the bypass and two other
nearby areas for residential and commercial use.
8.2   Follow-up Activities
The Summary Environmental Assessment addresses program preparation activities completed over
an eight month period, involving a full time expatriate and Indonesian environmental team. Local
consultations are scheduled to continue during subsequent programn preparation activities to address
project-specific issues of ROW status, land and building valuation, compensation altematives and
availability of local budgets. Follow-up impact studies for future projects are part of the

programmatic appraisal procedure agreed to between the Bank and BINI; NT and will be included fcr
fuinding under SURIP.
Thcse follow-up activities will include the preparation of detailed environrnental impac assessments
(ANDAL studies) and resettlement action plans, which will involve and document more extensive
local consultations and participation. Current GOI regulations (PP 51/1993) rtquires that the public
is informed of all project activities that requirc an ANDAL study and recommends the representation
of local comununities and nor-goverunent organiz'tions on the AMDAL commissions responsible for
project reviews. To address unavoidable social impacts, consultation and community participation
are an integral part of land acquisition procedures under Keppres 55/1993 and are required under
World Bank OD 4.30.
