1    INTRODUCTION AND SUNIMARY
The Strategic Urban Road Infrastructure Project (SURIP) will assist the Govermnent of Indonesia
(GOI) address existing capacity constraints on the urban sections of the nation's primary road
network. Over a five year (1996-2001) loan period. the current program will focus on projects within
the North Java Transport Corridor LNJTC), which serves as the principal road network between the
country's two largest cities. Jakarta and Surabava. and plays a significant role in Indonesia's rapidly
growing economy. Potential projects in other provinces of the country have been identified during
strategic assessment activities and these will be considered under subsequent SURIP phases.
SURIP will be implemented by the Directorate of Urban Road Development (BINKOT). of the
Directorate General of Highways (Bina Marga), Ministry of Public Works. To comply with project
appraisal requirements of the World Bank, a Summary Enviromnental Assessment and this separately
bound. Executive Surntary have been prepared and approved by BINKOT. These documents
sumnarize the enviromnental reviews conducted during the project's preparation stage in accordance
with GOI and World Bank procedures.
1.1    Framework for Environmental Impact Assessment
The governing legislation of the Indonesian environrnental impact assessment (AMDAL; Analisa
Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan) process is provided by Government Regulation No. 51 of 1993 (PP
51/1993). The implementing guidelines of Bina Marga's AMDAL screening process will be directly
applied to all SURIP projects. This process provides a systematic approach to impact assessment,
monitoring and management based on a project's type, scale and location (see Annex 1). All projects
proposed for World Bank funding are subject to environmental review and approval. SURIP has been
classified as a Category A type program' and individual projects proposed for funding under the
program will be subject to review and approval requirenents as described in Operational Directive
4.01 (Environmental Assessment) and in accordance with current GOI regulations (PP 51/1993).
1.2    Main Points of the Summarv Environmental Assessment
*      Limited environmental and social impacts have been identified for the five projects initially
proposed for SURIP funding. While classified as urban roads, these proposed projects
involve some 36 kilorneters of road widening and new construction activities of bypass
alignments around urbanized sections of the NJTC road network:
*      Preliminiary details are currendy available on later year projects, which presently include
seven additional urban bypasses totalling some 50 kilometers in length. These subsequent
projects may involve more significant impacts due to their substantial ROW requirements.
Follow-up impact studies for future projects are part of a programmatic appraisal procedure
agreed to between the Bank and BINKOT and included for funding under the SURIP;
*      Institutional strengthening and environmental training activities will be required and are
included in the loan program to support project evaluation, implementation and monitoring
requirements of the SURIP program. Theses activities will focus on the role of BINKOT's
environmental section and on-site project managers (Pinpros).

2     PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Current initiatives to improvc inter-urban road sections within the NJTC include components of the
World Bank-assisted Y.Ighway Sector Loan 11, the OECFZ-assisted Heavy Loaded Road Improvement
Project and the ADB3-assisted North Java Road Improvement Project. SURIP has been proposed to
assist the GOI address existing constraints on urban4 sections of this principal road network. The
three main components of SURIP are:
*     an urban roads component. which will identify and prepare a priority program  of
improvement projecLs along the NJTC that can be implemented over the next five years;
*     a technical assistance component, which will provide advisory support and assistance to
BINKCOT and local agencies to enhance their transport planning and implementation capacity;
*     a procurement component. to support procurement of professional services needed for
subsequent project preparation activities.
Five initial projects that could be started during the first two years of the loan period (1996-1998)
have now been prepared for appraisal under the urban roads component. These proposed "year I"
projects involve the widening or new construction of some 36 kilometers of urban bypass roads. As
selection criteria, these projects were in an advanced stage of preparation and did not present any
significant impediments to implemenation, such as major environmental concerns or the need to
acquire substantial road right-of-ways (ROW). Typical project features include the provision for a
divided, 4-lane asphaltic concrete roadway, with associated intersection, bridge and drainage structure
improvements. The evaluation of possible "later year" (1998-2001) projects is on-going and presently
involve some 50 kilometers of road widening or new construction activities of urban bypass
aligmnents along the NJTC. The general locations of these projects are indicated in Figure 1.
3   EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS
The geographic focus of SURIP is the North Java Transport Corridor (NJTC). within the provinces
of West, Central and East Java. Topographically constricted to a narrow coastal plain, this corridor
has historically been a center for human settlement, culural and agricultural development. With only
7% of the country's land area, the island of Java accounts for some 60% of the nation's population,
resulting in population densities that are among the highest in the world today. National and regional
planning strategies identifv the NJTC is a major coastal development corridor and the trend towards
urbanization and industrial development is expected as well as planned to continue.
Topography/Soils/Geology: The projects cross level terrain, at elevations ranging from I to 10
meters above sea level. Local soils are typically alluvial with high clay content and expansive
characteristics. Java is volcanically acive and all project areas are within seismic zone 45.

Hydrology: Project alignments cross numerous small rivers, creeks, drainage and irrigation canals
with poor water quality due to intensive domestic. agricultural and industrial use and discharges.
Flooding is a significant seasonal concern in low laying coastal areas.
Meteorology and Air Qualitv: Climate is tropical and monsoonal, with lowland rainfall in the
annual range of 1.2 to 2 meters. The wet season generally lasts from December to May. though rains
do occur throughout the year. Typical wind conditions are described as light (< 5 meters/second).
Available studies indicate increasing concern for air pollution and noise in congested urban areas.
Biological Resources: Based on field surveys. the proposed project areas do not involve sensitive
ecological habitats or areas with identified high biodiversity values. All areas along these project
alignments are devoted to intensive agricultural, residential, cotmmercial and industrial land use.
Population and Hunman Settlements: Population densities are high in the NJTC, ranging from 1.I 10
persons/square kilometer in Kabupaten Pemalang to 6,953 persons/square kilometer in Kotamadya
Cirebon. The concemed urban areas (and projected 1995 populations) include Cirebon (500.000).
Pemalang (165,000), Weleri (47.000). Kaliwungii (54.000) and Sernarang (1.700.000).
Cultural Resources: Java has an exceptionally rich cultural history, which typicalry includes historic
buildings. cemeteries and mosques in roadside areas. With the exception of the Cirebon Bypass.
areas with potential archaeological and historical resources have not been identified for the project
areas to date. though limited information is available.
4      SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONNMENTAL IMPACTS
Significant economic and environmental benefits have been identified for these initial projects, as
measured by direet savings in vehicle operating costs and passenger travel time resulking from
improved traffic flows and travel speeds. These project benefits would translate into overall
reductions in fuel use and vehicular emissions, particularly along three congested urban routes where
daily traffic levels in the range of 20.000 vehicles are predicted to be reduced by 30 - 80 % following
traffic diversions to the new bypass alignments which pass through sparsely populated, agricultural
areas. The provision of urban bypasses with median dividers will contribute to reducing traffic
accidents and their severity. as available statistics indicate that some 30% of traffic accidents along
the NJTC are head-on collisions, with high fatality rates.
Based on a review of the proposed project areas and activities. the following environmental
parameters were identified as being of primary importance to SURIP: soils. flooding, ecology. air
quality. noise, population. land use plaming. land acquisition. relocation and resettlement. and
cultural resources. These general parameters are briefly below. Summary impact descriptions for
the year 1 projects are provided in Table 1. A priority concern during the assessment of each project
was the potential for social impacts of any required ROW areas. - Identified social impacts primarily
involve the Cirebon Bypass, where a proposed 22 meter wide ROW will require an additional 4
hectares of adjacent land, portions of 39 existing structures and potentially displace six families (30
people). No resettlemnent requirements have been identified for the other year 1 projects.
Soils: Proposed projects will be constructed on embankments requiring 200.000 to 300.000 cubic
meters of fill materials. These quantities are considered moderate and ample supplies are available
in the area. Under GOI regulations. all quarry or borrow materials must be obtained from permitted
sites. which are under the jurisdiction of local governnent agencies at the district (kabupaten) level.
The project contractor is directly responsible for selecting the licensed site that is used and for any
required quarry site rehabilitation. Tvpical excavation quantities range from 10,000 to 40,000 cubic
meters. and disposal requirements are addressed by Bina Marga's standard operating procedures.

Flooding: The NJTC area has a history of flood events and construction of embanknent roads could
restrict storm waters, increasing upstream flooding levels. Except for the Cirebon Bypass, all year
I projects are located downstream of urban areas. All proposed projects are provided with bridge
and drainage structures designed according to historic records of flood events and the observed
performance of existing upstream structures to minimize flood risks.
Ecology: The proposed road aligmnents involve areas that have been historically devoted to
agricultural, residential or commercial use. Due to their proximity to urban areas, these projects are
very unlikely to impact sensitive cco-systemns, such as the habitats of rare or endangered species.
Air Quality: The completed projects are predicted to reduce ambien; pollution levels in congested
urban areas by improving traffic flows and diverting traffic outside of these highly populattd areas.
Cumulatively, SURIP projects will have a positive impact on air quality.
Noise: National noise standards have not yet been established in Indonesia. A school building and
a health clinic are located adjacent to the Weleri Bypass. These noise sensitive facilities will be
relocated or provided with noise barriers as part of the project.
Population: The proposed projects are expected to benefit the concemed cities by supporting local
initiatives to divert heavy vehicle, through traffic outside of congestzd urban areas. Cumulatively, the
SURIP projects are supportive of the rapidly expanding economy of Indonesia.
Land Use Planning: Proposed new road alignments may encourage 'ribbon" development, resulting
in conversion of farm lands. The proposed projects are in compliance with local development plans.
Future development activities along these roads will require local government approvals in accordance
with existing land use and development regulations which protect irrigated paddy rice areas as an
issue of national importance. The capacity of local goverment agencies to control development and
land use along new road aligmnents is likely to vary.
Land Acquisition: Additional ROW requirements for the year 1 projects is currently estimated at
7.5 hectares. Some additional ROW areas may be required for intersection improvements. the final
designs of which are not yet available. All ROW areas will be acquired in accordance with current
GOI regulations, which provide established procedures for community consultations and legal recourse
in setting local land and building compensation values.
Relocation and Resettlement: These additional ROW areas include portions of some 45 - 50
commercial and residential structures, mostly of temporary construction. Current estinate of total
building areas affected is less than 2,000 square meters. Based on local surveys, most affected
occupants will rebuild their structures outside ol new ROW  area and prefer adequate cash
compensation as opposed to formal resettlement. Under GOI laws, compensation is generally not
provided for lost business, though significant appreciation in real estate values typically occurs as a
direct result of completing a new road project, to the economic benefit of local land owners.
Cultural Resources: No significant impacts on cultural resources have been identified to date and
excavations for the proposed construction activities are limited to licensed quarry operations and
required drainage structures. Existing cultural facilities along the Cirebon Bypass (the Goa Sunyaragi
complex) are located outside of the proposed ROW for this road widening project, along an existing
4-lane section of this busy route. Procedures governing the chance discovery of archaeologic or
historic artifacts and sites are provided by Republic Act (UU RI) No. 511992 and included in standard
Bina Marga tender documents.

5     ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
Altemative analyses provided by the ADB-funded North Java Corridor Transport Study (1992) and
the OECF-funded Heavy Loaded Road Improvement Project Study (1993) established the existing
NJTC road aligmnent as the preferred route between Jakarta and Surabaya. Alternative transportation
modes are available, namely rail, sea and air. Roads are presently the domninant mode of transport.
An alternative strategy to improving the primary arterial road network as proposed by SURIP is the
future extension and expansion of the network of toll roads on Java.
Project specific altematives considered during the evaluation process included the 'do-minimum'
alternative; new aligrnent alternatives; improvements to existing traffic diversion routes, and railroad
crossing altematives. The initial year 1 projects involve the widening of existing roads or completion
of projects with an established ROW. The 'without" project, do-minimum alternative would lead
increasing traffic congestion and continued environmental degradation in the urban areas through
which existing routes pass. The design considerations of the year I projects served to minimize
potential impacts by avoiding congested urban and village (kampung) settlement areas. Various other
design and construction alternatives were evaluated, including nurnber of travel lanes; cross-section
alternativcs; road access control; provisions for pedestrians and unmnotorized vehicles; intersection
configuration alternatives, and staged project implementation.
As a selection criteria, the year 1 projects were in an advanced stage of preparation and project
implementation. More extensive alternative analyses are schedule and budgeted under SURIP to
evaluate the later year projects, to include feasibility, urban transport and planning studies of proposed
projects, supported by aerial photography and updated mapping of these areas.
6   ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING
6.1   Proposed Year 1 Projects
In accordance with Bina Marga's AMDAL screening process, enviromnental management and
mionitoring action plans have been prepared for all year 1 projects. The general requiremnents and
responsibilities stipulated in these project documents are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Additional
environmental reviews are required as final engineering designs are completed and these reviews will
be provided in the appraisal documents. Identified mitigation measures include the provision of noise
barriers or relocation of sensitive school and health clinic facilities along the Weleri Bypass. The
construction costs for these measures will be included as part of the loan package, while required land
areas will be requested from the local government.
6.2    Potential Later Year Projects
Preliminary project descriptions and initial envirounental reviews of these later year activities will
be provided to the World Bank as part of project appraisal documents. Each of these projects will
be subject to further studies in accordance with GOI and World Bank requirenents, and a budget for
these follow-up studies will be included in the loan package. For projects involving significant
impacts, detailed environmental assessment (ANDAL) studies will be conducted in accordance with
Bina Marga's AMDAL screening process (Annex 1). ANDAL studies are currently being prepared
for the Cirebon Bypass flyovers and Kalibanteng Flyover and these projects will only proceed
following approval under the GOI review process.

6.3   Institutional Responsibilities
As their enviromnental unit. the BINKOT Section AMDAL will be directly responsible for planning.
coordinating and monitoring all required environmental activities for SURIP, These responsibilities
will place significant demands on the limited staff and resources of BINKOT Section AMDAL. To
support their important project role, institutional strengthening and environmental training activities
will be proposed under SURIP's technical assistance component. These training activities will
spocifically include all on-site project managers (Pinpros).
7   SOCIAL IMPACT MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING
7.1    Proposed Year 1 Projects
The selection criteria of these initial projects specifically included ROW availability and unavoidable
social impacts are addressed in the environmental management and monitoring plans prepared for each
of these projects. With the noted exception of six families that could be displaced along the Cirebon
Bypass. no other resettlement impacts have been identified. As a result, a primary form of impact
management for these initial projects is expected to be cash compensation for the estimated 7.5
hectares of additional ROW areas. Preliminarv estimates of ROW land and building compensation
costs have been prepared for project appraisal. Actual costs will be determined based on mapping
surveys, consultations and negotiations to be conducted by concerned local government agencies.
7.2    Potential Later Year Projects
Most ROW areas for later year projects have not been acquired and these ROW requirements may
involve more significant social impacts and resettlement issues. Prelininary project descriptions and
initial social impact reviews will be provided to the World Bank as part of project appraisal
documents. Each of these projects will be subject to further social impact reviews and approvals in
accordance with GOI and World Bank requirements. In compliance with World Bank OD 4.30,
resettlement action plans would be prepared by BINKOT for any proposed projects where
displacement is unavoidable. These plans will detail project requirements and time-bound procedures
for land acquisition and resettlement, consultation, property and building surveys, building demolition
and restoration, available compensation and resettlement alternatives, and all monitoring and
evaluation activities. SURIP funding of these later year projects will be conditional on the Bank's
approval of these resettlement action plans, and full documentation of all land acquisition and
resettlement activities.
7.3    Land Acquisition and Compensation Procedures
Recent reports', local consultations, and household surveys along the Cirebon Bypass all indicate that
cash compensation as opposed to formal resettlement, will generally be the preferred option for land
and building acquired for ROW areas. The GOI's land acquisition and compensation procedures to
be applied under SURIP are currently governed by Presidential Decree No. 55 of 1993 (Keppres
55/1993)7. which stipulate that cormmunity consulttions ("musyawarah") will be conducted to reach
agreement on the form and amount of compensation.

Kepprcs 55/1993 further stipulates thaL alternative fonns of compensation will be made available and
these may take the formn of:
*      cash compensation:
*      land in substitution.
*      resettlement:
*      a combination of two or more of these forms of compensation, or
*      other forms agreed upon by the parties concerned.
All land acquisition requirements of SURIP will be conducted in accordance with the mechanisms
provided in the operational directive of Keppres 55/1993. At this preparation stage of the program,
these land acquisition and compensation procedures have been informally agreed between BINKOT
and the concerned local governments. Formal agreements will be entered into following World Bank
funding approval of the SURIP program and the proposed projects.
According to Keppres 55/1993. the monetary value of land compensation will be based on current
prices. with consideration of the sales value of tax object (Nilai Jual Obyek Pajak. NJOP). Existing
site improvements and buildings are separately valued according to rates established by the provincial
offices of the Directorate General of Human Settlements (Dinas Cipta Karya). Grievance procedures
for dispute settlement. administrative and legal appeals are provided for under Keppres 55/1993.
Based on draft reports of the Bank's Resident Staff in Indonesia'. these current GOI procedures
provide a framework for land acquisition that is compatible with World Bank resettlement policies
(OD 4.30). The principle objective of these of these policies is to ensure that those displaced by a
project should be at least as well off, if not better off, than they would have been without the project.
7.4    Resetdeznent Principles of the SURIP Program
In line with GOI regulations and World Bank policies, the resettlement principles that will guide the
SURIP program are:
-      projects will be selected and designed in a manner that will avoid or minimize resettlement:
*      compensation for land areas acquired for project ROWs will be valued at replacement costs,
with consideration of the sales value of the tax object (NJOP). and local surveys to be
conducted during the preparation of each resettlement action plan;
*     the compensation value of project affected buildings and site improvements will be calculated
at replacement costs according to provisions of the respective resettlement action plan:
*     displaced families will be allowed to retain existing building materials and relocation
assistance will be provided;
*      as needed, resettlement sites will have sufficient infrastructure and public facilities;
*     assistance will be provided to support livelihood activities at the new site; and
*     consultations will be held with the displaced families prior to resettlement.
These general principles will be defined in accordance with Keppres 55119,93 as loan agreements
during project appraisal and further developed in the form of an operational manual during follow-up,
project preparation activities.

action plans that will be prepared for SURIP projects involving social displacement. Under World
Bank policies (OD 4.30). the responsibility for land acquisition and resettlement rests with the GOI.
In accordance with Keppres 55/1993, this responsibility is placed under local government authorities
and the currently proposed projects will directly involve 12 different local governments in three
provinces. The GOI will accord priority to the allocation of sufficient funds for the purpose of
acquiring ROW and any resettlement requirements of the project. For projects that have substantial
ROW requirements. Keppres 55/1993 also stipulates that a Land Procurement Team will be formed
to facilitate the land acquisition process, and these teams will include reprcsentatives from concerned
local govermnent agencies; village, municipal and district officials; and the project manager.
Documentation of all land acquisition activities will be provided to the provincial agrarian office,
Office of the Governor or Mayor according to project jurisdiction. For monitoring purposes. each
project manager (Pinpro) will be required to maintain a complete set of these documents, to include
cadastral maps. physical descriptions of house locations and building type, owners' name, tenure
status, and evidence of payment. Sumnmary reports of all land acquisition activities will be provided
to the BINKOT Section AMDAL to support their central role in project monitoring. Draft terms of
reference for the SURIP general consultant will be presented at project appraisal and will include
specific project monitoring and information management responsibilities.
8     LOCAL CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION
8.1    Program Preparation Activities
Local consultations have been conducted within the Indonesian political and cultural framework,
which typically involves two stges of consultations - preliminary, project development consuitations
at an inter-agency, local governnent level; followed by commumty consultations ('musyawarah')
which are conducted by local officials. During the course of progran preparation and field surveys.
extensive meetings and consultations were held with local officials and government departments to
discuss the rationale and current status of each project. These consultations have included city,
district and provincial government officials; representatives of concerned planning and public works
departments; project managers (Pinpros) of each area; members of local land procurement
committees, and officials of related transport sectors (railways, ports, bus terminals). A summary
list of project contacts is provided in Annex 2. During these initial assessments and preparation of
the AMDAL documents for year 1 projects. informal discussions were also held with residents and
businesses located along each aligmnent. The proposed year I projects involve the completion of
activities that have been in progress for several years, but the participants and outcome of previous
cormnunity meetings and consultations were not recorded.
The proposed projects have a high level of loca, govermnent support and compliment on-going
initiatives and transport planning measures to divert heavy vehicle, through traffic outside of
congested urban areas. Residents and businesses located along the road alignments are generally
aware of the proposed projects from infornation provided to them by local officials and project
mnanagers. Project ROW requirements, compensation values for affected land and building areas,
and availability of local budgets to fund ROW costs were the primary enviromnental issues raised
during these program preparation consultations. Based on available reports. such issues are common
for road capacity expansion projects along the North Java Transport Corridor. These sensitive issues
remain to resolved and will need to be fully addressed as part of the follow-up activities. project
appraisal documents and project-specific resettlement action plans. During the eight month program
preparation period covered by this report, no opposition to the proposed projects has been noted or
reported other than the identified concern for land compensation based on market values.

Cirebon Bypass: As a formal means of consulting local residents on resettlement issues. detailed
socio-economictperception surveys were conducted for 131 households along the Cirebon Bypass that
could be affected by the project. T'he number of residents and businesses identified in these surveys
contributed to design changes that reduced the proposed ROW width from 38 to 22 meters to
minimize the number of residents and businesses that would be displaced.
These survev results indicate that most respondents (82%) have been informed of the project by local
officials and nearly all (97%) support it if compensation for their affected properties is based on
market value.  Cash compensation is the preferred alternative (80%), although 20%  of the
respondents reported that they would be willing to move if a nearby resettlement area was available.
Three possible sites were identified in subsequent discussions with the city government of Cirebon,
including commercial areas within the new bus terminal located along the bypass and two other
nearby areas for residential and commercial use. These consultations and the alternative options of
cash compensation or resettlement are documented in the resettlement action plan prepared for the
Cirebon Bypass.
8.2   Follow-up Activities
The Sunmmary Enviromnental Assessment addresses program preparation activities completed over
an eight month period. involving a full time expatriate and Indonesian environmental team. Local
consultations are scheduled to continue during subsequent program preparation activities to address
project-specific issues of ROW status, land and building valuation, compensation alternatives and
availability of local budgets.  Follow-up impact sLudies for future projects are part of the
programmatic appraisal procedure agreed to between the Bank and BINKOT and will be included for
funding under SURIP.
These follow-up activities will include the preparation of detailcd enviromnental impact assessments
(ANDAL studies) and resettlement action plans, which will involve and document more extensive
local consultations and participation. Current GOI regulations (PP 51/1993) requires that the public
is informed of all project activities that require an ANDAL study and reconmnends the representation
of local communities and non-government organizations on the AMDAL commissions responsible for
project reviews. To address unavoidable social impacts. local consultation and participation are an
integral part of land acquisition procedures under Keppres 55/1993 and are required under World
Bank OD 4.30.

Document Descriptions
Keranuka Acuan (KA; ANDAL terns of reference) - a set of project-specific guidelines and criteria
which define the scope of studies and analyses that should be undertaken by proponents in their
preparation of an ANDAL.
Analisis Damnak Linnkungan (ANDAL; environmental impact assessment) - a detailed impact
assessment report. It provides an analyses of the potentially significant envirornmental effects, both
positive and negative, generated by a project, and serves to identify and evaluate possible solutions.
Rencana Pengelolaan Lingningan (RKL; envirornental management procedures) - a specific guide
derived from an ANDAL that sets design and operating requirements for mitigating project impacts.
The RKL may specify operting procedures, compliance standards, responsibilities and schedules.
Rencana Pemantauan Lingkungan (RPL; environmental monitoring plan) - a specific guide derived
from an ANDAL that describes the means for monitoring project compliance with requirements and
procedures provided in the RKL as well as with established with environmental standards.
Kaiian Lingkunean (KL; initial environmental evaluation) - a preliminary level of environmental
studies that describe the existing conditions of an area, and types and magnitude of predicted project
impact. The KL further serves as a 'decision document' that supports a detennination of the
project's need for a detailed ANDAL study. For projects that do not require further study, the KL
guides the preparation of the related UKL and UPL .
Upava Kelola Lingkungan (UKL; enviromnental management action plan) - similar in many respects
to a RKL. the UKL is derived from a KL study and a determination that predicted impacts are not
significant and can be nanaged by standard operating procedures. The UKL is operational in scope
and serves as a binding instrument for the proponent with regard to environmental management.
Unava Pemantauan Line&unran (UPL; environmental monitoring action plan) - similar in many
respects to a RPL, the UPL provides the monitoring counterpart to a project's UKL.
