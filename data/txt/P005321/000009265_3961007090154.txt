MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPME
TO.THIE.EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN FOR THE
AGRICULTURE SECTOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT PROJECT
1.       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan of US$6.60 million -equivalent to the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan to help finance the Agriculture Sector Technical Support Project.   The
proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms of variable interest rate with 20
years' maturity, including a grace period of five years.   The Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA) and the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI  as well as
agricultural producers would be the beneficiaries.
2.       Backmrount.  Agriculture contributes about 7t to Jordan's GDP, employs
0l of the workforce, and accounts for 15t of total exports. The overriding
factor which constrains the development of agriculture is the limited
availability of water. The instability in regional markets since the Gulf War
and the slow pace of technological change in some critical areas have compounded
the problems faced by the sector.
3.       The Government is embarking on an adjustment program in the sector to
effect the transition to a more sustainable and efficient use of limitea natural
resources. Effectively, the prospects for the sector depend on its ability to
use water with increasing efficiency, to identify and produce for new markets,
and to switch to new, higher value products. There is slibstantial scope for
improvements in productivity and profitability within existing resource
limitations, but exceptional measures are needed to bring about the required
structural changes in Jordanian agriculture. These changes are being supported
by an Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL) financed by the World Bank and
German Credit Agency for Reconstruction (KFW).
4.       To ensure efficient implement. ion of the reforms and to help build
public capacity for providing key services to the agriculture and water sectors,
Government has  requested Bank and donor assistance  for an accompanying
Agriculture Sector Technical Assistance Program (ASTAPI.   ASTAP is a broad
program of multi-donor support for the sectors, serving as a tool for donor
coordination,  ensuring synergy and avoiding overlap.   Within the ASTAP,
Government has requested Bank assistance for an Agriculture Sector Technical
Support Project (ASTSUP).  The project would be cofinanced by the German Agency
for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and KfW. It would be implemented as a free-
standing project, but closely linked to the ASAL.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The ASTSUP and the agriculture sector
-adjustment program (ASAL) are parallel, mutually reinforcing operations, which
have been designed in conformity with the Bank's country assistance strategy in
Jordan, as presented to the Board on March 11, 1993.   In particular, Bank
involvement in the ASTSUP will ensure that key activities central to the success
of the adjustment program are adequately carried out. -In addition, Government has
sought Bank assistance to help catalyze maximum grant cofinancing for ASTAP; Bank
financing would facilitate this within the context of a coherent program of
policy adjustment and investment.



6.       gproect Ob_ectives.  The objectives of the project are to assist the
Government in the implementation of agricultural policy adjustments and to
improve services to farmers and livestock producers.  The project would provide
support for the implementation of measures to protect and optimize use of surface
and groundwater resources; build capacities in agricultural research and
extension institutions to improve services to producers, particularly focussing
on production systems that are most vulnerable during adjustment; and develop
monitoring and evaluation capacity to track the effects of adjustment.
7.      Prolect Descrintion.  As detailed below, the project will support-the
adjustment program through: (a) water measurement and management in the Jordan
talley; (b) groundwater basin monitoring and control; (c). strengthening research;
(d) developing extension; and (e) carrying out monitoring and evaluation of the
impacts of the adjustment program.
S.      The first component, financed from the Bank loan, will help improve
water measurement anI management in the Jordan Valley. Under the adjustment
program, Government is strengthening demand management in the Valley, and
introducing higher irrigation water charges.   This is expected to improve
efficiency of water use and the allocation of water to high priority areas.
Increases in charges can only be fair and effective as a demand management tool
if water is both delivered on time and correctly measured.   This requires
completion of the ongoing program for installing secure meters and water control
devices on all irrigation turn-outs.  In order to facilitate improved water
measurement and management, the project would, therefore, finance the
rehabilitation of 2,150 improved farm turn-outs, and provide water control
devices and protection boxes in three areas in the Jordan Valley. The project
would also support the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA) with equipment and vehicles
to improve operation and maintenance, to upgrade the JVA laboratory so it can
carry out water and soil testing, and to provide required training and technical
assistance.
9.      Under the second component,  as part of the adjustment program,
Government is adopting a program to move towards sustainable groundwater
abstraction nationwide, and implementing a full management program to meter and
control all groundwater production, supply and usage. Under KfW financing, the
project will therefore support monitoring and control being carried out by the
Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) through its ten Basin Protection Units (BPUs).
The BPUs, as implementation arms of WAJ, have been set up to improve monitoring
and control of groundwater abstraction. The project would finance the purchase
and installation of 2,300 flow meters on tubewells not equipped under the ongoing
program, and provide a limited number of automatic groundwater level recorders,
water level meters, laptop computers, and other equipment, as well as vehicles
and training for WAJ staff to facilitate the work of the BPUs. Ten water tankers
would also be financed to improve water conveyance efficiencies to high areas of
Amman during peak demand periods of the summer months. This is a less costly
method of delivering water to these areas than the existing piped system. In
addition, the tankers would facilitate spatial transfer of water from low to
higher value uses and would service areas unserved by the small private tanker
market.
10.     Under the remaining components, the project would strengthen the key
agricultural support services of research and extension to enable them to better
advise producers on optimizing p-rductivity in response to changing price signals
during adjustment. Support will be directed at areas of potential that could not



-3-
be served by other means and at small-scale, poorer farmers who might otherwise
bear a disproportionate brunt of adjustment.-
11.      The adjustment program will change relative prices, creating new
challenges and pressures for farmers. To help Jordanian agriculture to adapt to
the new economic realities, especially taking into account the needs of poorer
farmers, there is a need for a-well-focussed public research program.  In the
area of research, Jordan has a large and well-equipped research organization, the
National Center for Agriculttural Research and Technology Transfer (NCARTT);
however, research management is a problem. The project would, therefore, support
NCARTT by: (a) hiring an experienced internationally-recruited management
specialist to assist its management and staff in implementing the recently
developed research strategy. The research strategy aims at providing-an overall
farmer-oriented direction, strengthening research planning and budgcating
capacity, reactivating the six regional research centers and strengtX' ing
research-exter.dion linkages; (b) financing the implementation of a national
workshop (with international participation) for research and extension staff and
MOA decision-makers to discuss and launch the new research strategy; (c)
organizing a seminar/course on integrated pest management (IPM) to be conducted
by an experienced internationally-recruited IPM specialist, which would involve
local researchers, extension staff, farmers, and private sector specialists as
participants; and (d) providing s5 staff-months of specialized training for
research staff in irrigation agronomy and dryland farming.
12.     On extension, the private sector is quite active and successful, but
there is a genuine public service role which is unmet at present. This includes
serving the needs of resource-poor farmers and addressing areas of common benefit
such as integrated pest management and rangeland degradation. The Department of
Extension and Information (DORI), which is responsible for public extension, has
a functional organization in place, but its staff could benefit from greater
direction and specific extension skills. Under the project, GTZ would provide
locally- and internationally-recruited technical assistance to develop a national
agricultural extension strategy which would provide overall direction for
extension.  Pilot extension activities will also be undertaken in about two
selected areas, whereby extension methodologies and approaches would be tested
at the community level. To complement the GTZ-financed aspects of extension, the
Bank loan will finance: (i) short-term specialized training (local and overseas)
on extension methods, participatory rapid rural assessment, and diagnostic
skills; (ii) training-related technical assistance, to conluct in-country special
courses of practical interest; (iii) office and audio-visual equipment for use
at the headquarters of the DOEI; and (iv) vehicles for field use.
13.     Measuring income changes affecting different segments of the population
during adjustment would enable Government to track the impact of agricultural
reforms and to plan for any corrective action needed. Therefore, with support
provided by GTZ under the project, MOA will undertake special surveys with a
baseline survey before major reforms (December 1994), and subsequent semi-annual
passes. Two complementary sets of surveys will be carried out: (a) crop budget
surveys to track gross margins for key geographic areas and farming systems; and
(b) household income surveys of representative sample farm households for key
areas, focussing on vulnerable populations and areas. Case studies will also be
used to gauge the impacts of adjustment on rural populations.

14.      Project Costa and FinaeinU.  Total project cost is estimated at
US$13.31 mill-ion equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$11.77 million
(88 percent of the total cost). GTZ is providing grants of US$2.20 million,
while XfW is-prov-iding a further US$3.08 million equivalent in grants and soft
loans. The Bank would provide Sor a loan of US$6.60 million. The Government
would finance about US$1.43 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A.  The -amounts and methods of procurement, and the
disbursement plan and estimated disbursemert schedule are in Schedule S.
15.    -  nlementaLtioft Arranmements.   The proceeds of the loan would be
disbursed over four and a half years. Project components would be carried out
as sub-projects in the two implementing ministries (MOA and MWI) and their
agencies, which have adequate capacity for executing the components. On specific
components, the JV. will carry out the water measurement and management
component, and WAJ will carry out the groundwater basin monitoring and control
component. The rcsearch component will be carried out by NCARTT, and the
extension by DORI; both are specialized agencies of MOA.   The implementing
agencies will prepare annual plans and budgets, implement components, account for
expenditures and present them for audit annually, and monitor progress and submit
annual progress reports. The Ministry of Agriculture has appointed a project
coordinator from existing staff to coordinate project activities, to consolidate
progress reports, and to serve as the contact person for Government, donors and
the Bank. Each agency will maintain separate project accounts and progress
reports and send them semi-annually to the Project Coordinator for consolidation.
16.      &_vironmental Impact.  The project is ranked environmental assessment
Category "C" in accordance with OD 4.01. The environmental impact of the project
is expected to be positive. By reversing the trend of mining of groundwater
resources and controlling salinity levels, sustainable availability of water can
be enhanced.   The promotion of integrated pest .management techniques would
encourage reduced use of pesticides and reduced toxins in food, and thereby help
improve public health and environmental quality.
17.      Agreements Reached.   Agreements were rei ched at negotiations that
Government will: (a) assign to the Project Coordinator the responsibilities for
coordination of project implementation; (b) carry out a mid-term review by the
end of the second year of implementation to assess overall progress based on
agreed terms of reference (Appendix 7, p. 30, Technical Annex); (c) undertake
procurement of goods and services in accordance with the Bank's Procurement
Guidelines; (d) maintain project accounts to be audited by an independent auditor
acceptable to the Bank; (e) submit to the Bank yearly audit reports and audited
accounts no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year; and (f)
recruit internationally an experienced management specialist for NCARTT by June
30,. 1995 to help launch and operationalize the agricultural research strategy.
Agreement was also reached with the Government that, in the light of their close
linkages, the ASAL and ASTSUP are required to become effective simultaneously.
18.      Benefits and Risks.   The main benefit of the project would be to
facilitate the timely implementation of proposed policy reforms in water and
agriculture to bring about more economical.ure of water and other agricultural
resources. By improving control and management of water resources, the project
would improve water distribution and use. Parmers who adjust would be induced



to shift to higher value, water-efficient cropping systems oriented towards
exports. Strategic investments in research and extension would over time raise
farm productivity and incomes, reduce produce loss, and improve rroduct quality
and prices. Under the project, poor farmers, who are unlikely to aztract private
extension services, would, in particular, benefit from targeted agricultural
research and extension interventions. The major risks of the project would be:
(a) resistance by well-owners to water metering- and (b) flight of trained
personnel which may undermine institutional investments  in research and
extension. On risk (a), JVA and WAJ will conduct user awareness campaigns through
the mass media and will combine tightened enforcement of regulations with
improved service to users.  on risk (b), for research, steps are underway to
provide NCARTT with the administrative and financial autonomy to set salary
scales and benefits at levels competitive with those of university staff. In
general, staff may be required to sign a contract to stay for a stipulated
minimum period after training.
19.     Reommendat . I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
