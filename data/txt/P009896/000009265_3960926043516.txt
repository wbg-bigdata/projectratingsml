WESTERN GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:              Government of India (GOI)
Beneficiary:          Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC)
Amount:                US$295.0 million equivalent
Lending Terms:         Repayment over 20 years, including five years grace, at the
standard variable interest rate. Funds will be onlent to ONGC
at a rate of at least 15% per annuma repayment over 15 years,
including five years' grace. GOI would bear the foreign
exchange and interest rate risks.
Project Description:  The objectives of the Western Gas Development Project are to
accelerate the production and utilization of natural gas in
India as a replacement for imported petroleum products, thus
saving substantial foreign exchange, and helping to overcome
energy shortages which constrain economic growth. In
particular, the project will:
- expand production of the offshore South Bassein gas field
from 10 to 20 MMCMD;
- support initial development of the Gandhar gas field, which
will produce up to 3.5 MMCMD of gas;
- eliminate flaring of about 1 MMCMD of associated gas at the
offshore Heera oilfield, by linking it by pipeline to
Bombay;
- appraise the potential of the outlying Tapti and H&Aira
fields by seismic surveys for possible future additions to
India's gas supply.
In addition, the project will encourage optimal planning of
gas production and utilization in India, through support for
studies of the least-cost investments for field development
and transmission infrastructure for the western region, and
the uses of gas which yield the greatest economic benefit.
Project Benefits:      The project investments are expected to result in
additional production of 11-12 MMCMD of natural gas,
equivalent to about 3.2 million tons of crude oil
annually, plus an additional 0.7 million tons per annum
of liquid petroleum products (LPG and NGL). This is
roughly equivalent to one-third of India's current
annual petroleum imports. The net economic benefit to

the country is estimated at US$550 million annually from
1991/2 onwards. The total net present value of the
investment is approximately US$2.5 billion.
Project Risks:        All petroleum investments have certain risks inherent in
the process of drilling and producing oil and gas. Even
though the major project components comprise development
(rather than exploration/appraisal) of new fields,
technical risks associated with eventual reservoir
performance do exiat and are comparable to any other new
field development.  Furthermore, poor planning and
coordination of the gas market with gas supply would
result in underutilization of the infrastructure
proposed. While sensitivity analyses indicate that the
project remains sound even with delayed gas offtake,
substantial benefits may be lost without proper
planning. Provision for comprehensive planning studies
is thus included in the project. Oil price fluctuations
will influence project economics; however, the economic
return on the investment will still be over l0X for oil
price. as low as US$12 per barrel.

I. TRE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Overview
1.01     The energy scarcity remains a key constraint to accelerating the rate
of India's economic growth. Fuel and power shortages continue to hamper the
full utilization of industrial and agricultural production capacities, and oil
imports, while significantly reduced, continue to absorb approximately one-
third of India's export earnings.
1.02     The growth of the energy sector has been constrained by the slow pace
at which energy resources have been developed, due to lim.ited availability of
funds for investment and the efficiency with which these are used. The level
of efficiency in the major subsectors such as the industrial sector, which
provides much of the equipment for energy production, and the transport
sector, which provides the vital link between the coal industry - India's
major commercial energy supplier -- and its users, also needs to be improved
for the country to achieve significant growth in the energy sector. Large
investments are required, in addition to greater efficiency in the use of both
new and existing investments in the energy sector in order to accelerate the
pace of development of energy resources.
1.03     Berause of the difficulties of rapidly mobilizing substantial
investment resources for the energy sector -- as well as the long gestation
period required for implementing energy projects, particularly hydro projects
-- it is important that the management of energy demand be improved, correct
energy substitution choices on the part of users be encouraged, and insti-
tutional capabilities and linkages in the energy sector be strengthened.
improvements in these areas could contribute significantly to reductions in
production costs and consumption of energy per unit of production by principal
energy users.
1.04     Although the Government of India (OOI) has accorded high priority to
development of energy resources, past efforts to reduce the rate of growth
of energy consumption have had only a marginal impact. During 1979/80-
1986/87, the growth of consumption of all commercial forms of energy averaged
about 6X annually, compared to an average GDP growth rate of 5X per year
during the same period. The elasticity of energy consumption with respect to
income still remains, at 1.2, relatively hMgh for a resource-scarce country
such as India.
B. Primary Energy Production
1.05     In India, commercial primary energy, which consists of coal, hydro
and nuclear power, and petroleum, accounts for slightly less than one-half of
total primary energy supply. The balance comes from non-commercial sources,
mostly firewood, agricultural and animal wastes. The supply of commercial
energy has been growing faster than that of non-commercial energy. By 1985/86
production of primary commercial energy hp-d reached about 120 million tons of
oil equivalent per year.
1.06     Coal is, and will continue to be, India's most abundant commercial
energy resource. It meets about 50% of the country's commercial energy



- 2 -
requirements. Total resources are estimated et over 112 billion tons,
approximately half of which is economically recoverable under present
conditions. At current rates of consumption this is equivalent to about 250
years total primary commercial energy. Most of India's coal is of low to
medium quality, and there are substantial bottlenecks in coal transportation,
with the result that in many areas of the country coal is a relatively
expensive energy resource.
1.07     Power.  As of 1985 total installed power generating capacity was
approximately 42,000 MW, of which 652 was conventional thermal, 33% hydro, and
2% nuclear. India has extensive hydro potential. The GOI accords high
priority to the development of hydropawer, but because hydroelectric projects
require long lead times and large capital commitments for tiieir
implementation, only a small share of India's hydro potential has been
developed now. Consequently most recent additions to power generating
capacity have been from thermal power plants. The share of thermal has
increased steadily over the last twenty years. At present, it accounts for
approximately two-thirds of generating capacity.
1.08     India's economic growth is highly dependent upon the performance of
the power sector. At LIdia's stage of growth, large gains in productivity can
result from increased use of power. Present per-capita production of
electricity is about 200 kilowatt hours which compares, for example, with
about 400 kilowatt hours per capita in the Philippines, where CNP per capita
is about three times that of India. Conversely, power shortages have a
serious adverse impact throughout the economy. During the 1950's and 1960's
power generation has kept pace with demand. Since 1970, however, supply has
fallen short of demand. This has resulted from delays in the commissioning of
new projects, operating and maintenance problems, and budget constraints which
have limited investment in the sector. These problems have been aggravated by
inefficient operations and distribution, unreliable coal supplies due to
transport problems, and the declining quality of coal. Recognizing these
problems, the GOI has undertaken a program of remedial measures. Although
power plant utilization rates increased significantly recently, the supply of
power is still expected to remain inadequate, especially in areas where coal
is not readily available.
1.09     Petroleum.  In the 1970's India discovered the giant Bombay High
offshore oil field. As a result, the country is presently able to produce
about 75% of its petroleum requirements. The results of stepped up
exploration efforts and recent discoveries point to existence of considerable
pltroleum resources. Nevertheless, India is not self-sufficient, and the
shortfall in the country's commercial energy requirements are met primarily
through imports of crude and petroleum products.
1.10     It is estimated that only one-fourth of India's likely commercially
recoverable petroleum reserves have been proven, with undiscovered potential
heavily weighted towards gas. Systematic petroleum exploration has only been
undertaken recently, and large parts of India's potentially hydrocarbon-
bearing basias have yet to be explored. It is expected that reserves yet
unproved will likely be in the more difficult geological areas, and more
likely will consist of gas than oil. Present recoverable reserves of oil are
approximately 500 million metric tons - enough to last 15 years at current
rates of production. Output from the Bombay High oil field, which accounts



- 3 -
for 701 of domestic oil production, is reachiug a plateau, and unless new
resources are identified, developed, and brought onstream, domestic osl
production will decline as Bombay High production declines over the next
decade.
C. Energy Consumption
1.11     In India the household sector accounts for a relatively small share
of commercial energy c o Mton (7X of coalt 19X of petroleum and 101 of
electricity). However, consumption of non-commercial energy in this sector is
high, particularly in the rural areas where the use of electricity and
kerosene is still limited mostly to lighting. Although the substitution of'
commercial energy for non-commercial energy will continue, non-commercial
energy will likely remain the most important energy resource for many rural
households.
1.12     In $Uiculture, energy needs are met mostly by animal power or by the
use of liquid fuels, mainly diesel oil. Co_mercial energy consumption in
agriculture accounts for only about 62 of total co_mercial energy use, but it
has grown rapidly during the past two decades, reflecting the efforts to
modernize this sector.
1.13     The industrial sector consumes about 351 of total commercial energy
resources and almost 602 of all energy (including non-commercial fuels). It
is by far the largest user of coal and electricity. In 1982/83, Indian
industry accounted for slightly more than 80% of coal consumption, 222 of oil
consumption, 472 of natural gas consumption and 62Z of electricity consump-
tion. Over the past twenty years the energy intensity (energy cost per unit
of value added) of industry has increased significantly. However, the growth
of energy intensity in industry is expected to slow down as a result of the
introduction of more energy-efficient technologies, the more efficient use of
existing capacities, and improvements in the design of plants and machinery.
1.14     The transport sector is the largest user of petroleum products and
the second largest user of coal. Over the past twenty years the structure of
energy demand by this sector has changed considerably as a result of the rapid
growth of road transport and the substitution of diesel electric for steam
locomotives. Current energy demand projections for the transport sector point
to a continuing decline in coal consumption as road transport increases and
railways continue to shift to more efficient diesel electric locomotives,
thereby contributing to a growing demand for petroleum products.
D. Energy Policy and the Role of Petroleum
1.15     Significant increases in energy demand in India are forecast over the
next twenty years as population grows and as the economy becomes more
industrialized. Demand is expected to grow most rapidly in the household and
industrial sectors, and the demand for electricity and petroleum is expected
to grow more quickly than demand for coal. The country's energy requirements
will far outstrip domestic supply for the foreseeable future, although this
overall shortfall can be reduced by increases in domestic energy production
and to a lesser extent by improvements in conservation and energy
efficiency. GOI's strategy in dealing with this situation is:



- 4 -
(a) To increase power generating capacity as rapidly as possible,
especially hydro and nuclearl
(b) To encourage the use of coal and accelerate the development of
gas resources;
(c) To reduce dependence on liquid petroleum products through
substitution; and
(d) To encourage conservation, energy efficiency and fuel
substitution through pricing, allocation, and conservation
programs.
1.16     This strategy is reasonable, given: (i) the persistent shortfall in
energy supply - especially power and coal supplies - which continues to hamper
economic growth and more rapid industrial development; (ii) the small
likelihood of any major reduction in the growth of energy demand in the near
future; (iii) fiscal constraints which limit COI's capability to undertake all
of the investments required in the energy sector; and (iv) recent changes in
petroleum prices and its impact on the oil industry. Even if these
constraints can be overcome, a substantial shortfall in energy supply is still
expected for the foreseeable future, most of which will have to be met from
imports of crude oil and petroleum products. The petroleum subsector will,
therefore, continue to play a crucial role in India's energy strategy for the
remainder of the century.
1.17     India's effort to adjust to the shocks of the two major oil price
increases of the 1970's has been largely successful; however, there is a need
to prepare for potentially serious shortfalls again in the 1990's. In order
to avoid a recurrence of the situation in which petroleum shortages could
constrain economic growth and/or put an unacceptable burden on the balance of
payments, the GOI has:
(a) Almost doubled its investment program in oil and gas exploration
and development;
(b) Expanded the role of natural gas as a replacement for liquid
hydrocarbons; and
(c) Encouraged the involvement of private contracting and service
firms in the petroleum sector, and solicited the interest of
international oil companies in the exploration process.
E. Petroleum Reserves and Production
1.18     India contains some 1.7 million sq km of sedimentary basins
containing projected reserves of about 15 billion metric tons of oil and
oil equivalent of gas in place. This corresponds to some 4-5 billion metric
tons or tons equivalent (30-35 billion barrels) of commercially recoverable
reserves. About 70% of the recoverable reserves are expected to be gas. Up
to now, only about 700 million metric tons (mt) of oil and 650 million mt oil
equivalent of gas reserves (800 billion cubic meters of gas) have been proven
- or slightly more than one-quarter of the likely commercially recoverable
reserves.



- 5 -
1.19     Oil production has increased dramatically over the last ten years,
principally as a result of development of the Bombay High field. Production
from this field contributes over 70X of domestic production, the balance being
produced in about equal proportions from onshore areas in Gujarat and Assam
(Table 1.1).

Soqrce: G01, ONGC, Bank staff estimates.
1.20     Oil production from Bombay High has now reached a plateau and is
expected to start to decline after 1992. Production from the other regions is
being sustained by improved recovery levels and augmented by marginal
discoveries of new reserves.
F. Petroleum Product Demand
1.21     Domestic production of petroleum has never been sufficient to meet
demand in India. However, due to the low level of petroleum intensity in the
economy, this shortfall did not become a major problem until the 1960's. At
that time increasing industrialization and population growth resulted in
increasingly large oil imports. By 1980/81 over 16 million tonnes (652 of
requirements) were imported. These relationships for selected years are
summarised in Table 1.2 below (Annex 1.1).

1.22     In the 1970's India met almost all of its requirements for petroleum
products by refining imported crude. Since then demand for refined products
has grown 5-6X per year. This additional demand has been met by refining
increased amounts of domestic crude (principally from Bombay High) and from
imports. Total refinery capacity has kept approximate pace with demand of
about 40 million tons per year (mtpy). However, the composition of refinery
output does not match the composition of demand. As a result, there is a
shortage of middle distillates, particularly kerosene and diesel, which is met
through imports.
G. Projected Supply/Demand Balances
1.23     Petroleum products demand in India will continue to grow, both
because current consumption is low, and because urban and industrial growth
results in increased intensity of petroleum use.  Even with improvements in
demand management and increased energy efficiency, consumption is expected to
grow at over 5X p.a. for the rest of the century, resulting in demand doubling
(to about 80 mtpy) by the year 2000. It is estimated that the production of
petroleum may increase to about 40 mtpy of crude by then (Annex 1.2). This
estimate is based on the assumption that production from the Bombay High
oilfield plateaus and then declines through the 1990's, and that new
production will, in general, be from smaller, more marginal new fields, and
from higher recovery rates of established fields.
1.24     Current plans of ONGC and 001 aim for an increase of production from
existing fields to 35 mtpy by 1990 (Annex 1.2). They are based on the
assumption that the pattern of small to medium discoveries continues at the
same rate as during the Sixth Plan, thus adding some 150 million tonnes of
commercially recoverable reserves in each five-year period. This would then
allow increases in production at the same rate as in the last two plan periods
(about 5 mtpy every five years) up until 1995, at which point the decline from
existing fields (especially the Bombay High oilfield) starts to take effect,
and production declines to the 35 mtpy level, having peaked at 40 mtpy in the
1990's.



1.25     Thus the petroleum supply constraint will likely continue through the
remainder of the century, and India will need to increase its imports of
petroleum. The Government is according high priority to identifying new
petroleum resources for the 1990's and beyond. One potentially significant
option is the substitution of natural gas for liquid petroleum products, and
although there are technical and economic limits to substitution
possibilities, the utilization of gas in appropriate markets offers the
prospect of substantially reducing India's prospective shortfall in petroleum
resources. The GOI, as a matter of policy, is supporting the substitution of
gas for petroleum to the greatest extent feasible. The current project is
designed to support these initiatives.
H. Petroleum Sector Policy
1.26     Exploration and Production.  There is substantial scope for
increasing the domestic production of oil and gas in India, both by
discovering new resources and by increasing recovery from existing oil
fields by the use of enhanced production techniques. Many areas with
petroleum potential are still under-explored and only a fraction of the
country's projected reserves have been found. Bank staff estimates that
perhaps some 50% of expected oil and 75-80% of expected gas remains to be
found. The pace and scope of exploration activity have been uneven, and there
have been limited important finds since the discovery of the Bombay High
oilfield in 1974. The GOI has recently attached high priority to an expanded
exploration effort by the two national oil companies, ONGC and OIL. Almost
US$3 billion equivalent has been allocated for exploration purposes alone over
the current Five-Year Plan period.
1.27     The finding of new hydrocarbon resources is of utmost importance to
India, and the overall prospectivity of the country justifies a continuing and
substantive exploration effort. The GOI's exploration strategy involves a
two-pronged approach: first, a continuing exploration effort by the two
national oil companies, ONGC and OIL; second, involving the international oil
industry in the more difficult, high risk offshore areas to complement this
national exploration effort. In regard to the exploration investment strategy
undertaken by the national oil companies, GOI recognizes that the investment
strategy has to be as cost effective as possible and thus should be made on
the basis of detailed geological information from seismic surveys, in order to
avoid premature drilling and needless dry holes. Specific Bank involvement in
making these programs increasingly cost-effective is being carried out in the
context of the Krishna-Godavari project and in the recently approved Oil India
project. In parallel, international oil companies were invited in May 1986 to
participate in a Third Round of exploration acreage offerings in which GOI
offered 27 exploration blocks on a sole risk basis. The response to this
offering in a difficult external climate, was encouraging. Twelve offers by
seven different companies or consortia covering both the western and eastern
offshore areas have been received. Four initial contracts were signed at the
end of 1987, with exploration activity expected to start soon thereafter.
1.28     The Role of Gas.  India has substantial untapped reserves of natural
gas. It is estimated that by the end of the century gas could replace up to
17 mtpy of petroleum products (about one-half of current consumption). To
date, however, there have been substantial delays in developing the gas market
and coordinating it with field and infrastructure development. As a result



- 8 -
gas remains underutilized. This situ4\tion is now changing as GOI establishes
a more concrete gas strategy. However, there are still problems of planning
and coordination, which this project seeks in part to overcome. The role of
gas and associated policy issues are described in more detail in Chapter II.
1.29     Public and Private Investment.  As the petroleum sector has grown
over the last decade, commitments of budgetary resources have increased
commensurately. Initially, most of these resources have been made available
to ONGC as budgetary transfers from the Government. During the past seven
years, ONGC has relied on internally generated funds supplemented by direct
borrow:ngs. Under the recently completed Sixth Plan, the petroleum sector was
origin-illy allocated an equivalent of approximately US$5 billion of
resources. This was increased to US$11 billion at a mid-Plan review, as it
became clear that accelerated expansion of the Bombay High oilfield would
yield high returns. Actual expenditure is estimated at US$9 billion
equivalent, as a result of some delays in a number of large projects. Despite
the large investments, the sector remained a net contributor to public
finances, paying approximately US$15 billion equivalent in taxes and dutie¶
over the Sixth Plan period according to preliminary estimates.
1.30     Under the Seventh Plan (1984/85-1990/91), about Rs 127 billion
(approximately US$9.7 billion equivalent, out of total public investment of
about US$140 billion), has been allocated to the petroleum sector, as
sumarized in Table 1.3, below.

1.31     By far the highest priority has been accorded to exploration and
production. All firm oil and gas development programs have been financed,
with the understanding that additional funds will be made available as
necessary for any new fields which can be developed during the Plan period.
In the natural gas sector most funds are allocated for the large on-going
infrastructure prejects to exploit the western offshore gas fields.
1.32     The allocation of US$9.7 billion should be viewed against the
background of a request for almost US$22 billion equivalent from the
implementing agencies (mostly ONCC). The Government cut these requests back



- 9-
substantially because there is a growing perception that many of the tasks
which ONGC has undertaken itself could be performed in a more cost-effective
manner by sub-contractors and/or suppliers, and that there should be an
increased role for private sector firms in the development of India's energy
sector.
1.33     Role of the Private Sector.  Over the past few years, privately owned
companies have become increasingly involved in providing goods and services to
this industry and in entering into joint ventures (between Indian private
companies and foreign companies) to supply technical oil field services and
equipment. A large portion of ttxe offshore equipment and services are
provided directly by foreign private companies on the basis of international
competitive bidding. During the last two years there has been a marked shift
in emphasis away from the financing of capital investments in the petroleum
sector by the public sector. This can be seen most notably in the Seventh
Plan, under which the GOI has instructed ONCC to cut its drilling rig
acquisition program by about 50% and instead to lease rigs from the private
sector. In addition, a decision was made not to commit public funds for the
fall financing of proposed new refineries, but rather to seek joint venture
private partners to develop these projects.
1.34     Under the recent Third Round exploration offering, international oil
companies have been invited to bid on offshore acreage to explore on a sole
risk basis. Under this arrangement oil companies commit themselves to a
certain program of exploration work at their own cost in exchange for a share
of subsequent production if hydrocarbons are found. Previous offerings to the
international industry by India have met with limited success because the
terms were not perceived as competitive, and the acreage offered was
relatively high risk. Under the current Third Round offering, a wider variety
of acreage is being offered, and the terms aad conditions proposed are
competitive with those offered by countries of similar prospectivity. Bidding
under this offering is currently going on and is expected to be completed
during the earlv part of 1988.
I. Petroleum Pricing
1.35     Producer Prices.  ONGC and OIL are paid a fixed producer price of
about Rs 1,800/mt (US$18.70/Bbl equivalent) for crude oil production. From
this amount, the Government deducts royalties, a federal tax ("cess"), and a
sales tax, resulting in a net producer price of about Rs. 1,020/mt
(approximately US$10.60/Bbl). This is in line with the average producer
prices realized elsewhere in the world, the cost of imported crude and
estimated production costs.
1.36     Consumer Prices.  Petroleum product prices are set by the
Government. These prices are based on the international prices of products
which are imported (generally CIF with an adjustment for domestic
transport). Exceptions are made in the cases of kerosene, which is subsidized
for social reasons, and for fuel oil and gasoline, which are sold at a premium
above import prices as a means of discouraging excessive consumption. Typical
consumer prices during the 1984-85 period in India (prior to the 1986 drop in
international crude and petroleum product prices) are summarized below
(Table 1.4).

1.37     Following the recent drop in world oil prices, domestic prices are
high relative to the border prices of imports. The GOI has decided not to
realign domestic prices immediately on the grounds that: (a) the fall in
international prices may be short-lived; (b) conservation efforts should be
encouraged; (c) investment in petroleum intensive technologies which may be
expensive to supply in the longer run should continue to be discouraged; and
(d) the resource mobilization opportunity presented by the temporary gap
between low international prices and domestic prices should be utilized.
India's present pricing regime is reasonable in light of these legitimate
concerns; however, if low international prices persist, the GOI may review its
domestic price structure accordingly.
II. THE GAS SUBSECTOR
A. Introduction
2.01     Geological conditions indicate that India probably has more
undiscovered gas reserves than oil reserves. Since recovery rates of gas tend
to be higher than for oil, natural gas can be expected to play a potentially
important role among India's future energy sources. To date, gas production
in India has consisted almost exclusively of gas produced in association with
oil. Large proportions of this gas have been flared for lack of
infrastructure or market. Recently infrastructure has been established to
deliver associated gas from Bombay High to users in Bombay. Initial
development of the giant South Bassein offshore free gas field is now also
under way, and financing for the second phase development is included in the
proposed project.  Plans are for South Bassein to ultimately produce 20 W CMD
of gas, equivalent to about 6.4 million metric tons of oil annually, or 162 of
India's total current consumption of petroleum.



- 11 -
2.02     Utilization of India's gas resources has been constrained by the
absence of distribution end transmission infrastructure, and the need to
develop markets for gas use. This situation is changing as the Government
recognizes the importance of gas as an energy source, and as the magnitude of
India's total gas reserves becomes better established. In 1984 the Government
established the Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL), with responsibilities which
include gas planning, marketing, and distribution. GAIL will also operate the
HBJ gas pipeline, a 1,700-km trunk line to take South Bassein gas to
fertilizer and power plants in the interior of the country. Commissioning of
the pipelinc is planned for 1988.
2.03     Original plans for the development and use of South Bassein gas
restricted use to the fertilizer and petrochemical industries, on the
assumption that gas availability was limited. This policy has now been
relaxed, and the COI is allocating gas to combined-cycle power plants along
the HBJ gas pipeline, as well as opening up the market to medium-scale
industrial users.
B. Gas Reserves and Production
2.04     Small amounts of associated gas have been produced in the Gujarat and
Assam regions for over 20 years. Since 1981 more significant quantities of
associated gas have been produced from Bombay High. Still, by 1985/86 natural
gas accounted for less than 2Z of India's commercial energy consumption. The
large reserves of non-associated gas which have been discovered in the South
Bassein field are expected to enter into production by the early part of
1988. Table 2.1 shows the historical production of gas by region in India
(Annex 1.3).

2.05     India's proven and probable gas reserves are estimated by Bank staff
at about 680 billion cubic meters (BCM), equivalent to about 550 million tons
of oil.  Approximately 80% of these reserves are located in the western
offshore region (550 BCM), 10% in the mountainous region of Assam (70 BCM),
and the other 10% in the Cambay Basin in Gujarat (60 BCH). These estimates
probably understate the potential for total gas discoveries, since gas-prone
areas have generally received less attention for lack of an immediate
market. Additional commercial reserves are expected to be found in the
eastern coastal area (including Krishna-Godavari) as a result of current
exploration efforts, and in the extreme northeast (Tripura-Nagaland).



- 12 -
2.06     The reserves and potential production from the three established gas-
producing areas, together with estimated reserve/production ratios, are shown
in Table 2.2. Total production of natural gas could rise over the next decade
from about 22 MMCMD in 1985/86 to 45-60 MMCHD, equivalent to 13-17.5 MMtoe per
year, or one-half of India's present production of crude. The bulk of this
additional production is expected to come from the western offshore area.

2.07     The principal constraints to bringing discovered reserves into
production are the absence of production and transmission infrastructure and
the relative under-development of the gas market. The major tasks facing the
Government are thus the coordination of supply facilities, construction of
infrastructure, and development of the market.
C. Gas Utilization
2.08     Gas markets in India are essentially regional markets, and are
currently limited to a small number of users of associated gas. In Assam
these include a fertilizer plant, the tea industry and the Assam State
Electricity Board. In Gujarat gas consumers include a few industries in
Baroda, the Jayat paper mill, a fertilizer plant and a power plant. Gas from
the Bombay High oilfield is utilized by a few fertilizer plants in Bombay, by
the Tata Electric Company, by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB),
and for the extraction of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
2.09     Up to the early 1980's, as much as 50 percent of associated gas has
been flared due to the isolated locations of many fields, the absence of
distribution infrastructure, and the lack of a developed market.  Associated
gas from Bombay High has also been flared, but this has been substantially
reduced recently with the installation cf sufficient compression capacity to
pump all gas to market in Bombay and in Gujarat (through the South Bassein
pipeline). Estimated gas use by sector in 1985/86 is shown in Table 2.3.

A further 606 MMCM (1.7 MMCMD) of gas was used for re-injection and in field
use, and the balance of 3,118 MMCM (8.5 MMCMD, or 38X of total production) was
flared.
D. Potential Total Demand
2.10     Gas reserve estimates are still being reviewed as evaluation and
development of fields proceed. A long-range, country-wide demand forecasting
exercise for gas has not yet been completed, as the Gas Authority of India Ltd
(GAIL) is currently undertaking a series of market assessments on a region-by-
region basis. In the absence of detailed demand information, indicative
estimates of the potential penetration of gas in India's energy sector can be
made on the basis of the experience of comparable developing countries with
more mature gas markets.
2.11     In general, the most economically attractive uses for gas are as
replacement for petroleum products, either as feedstock or as fuel. In many
countries, fuel oil replacement in power generation or industry represents the
dominant gas use in the early years of market development. Howeverp in India
gas consumption will be concentrated, at least initially, in feedstock uses.
India has large domestic fertilizer requirements and consumption of fuel oil,
which gas would otherwise replace, is relatively limited as a result of the
extensive use of domestic coal resources in industry and power generation.
Fuel oil consumption in India is limited to about 20% of total petroleum
product consumption, compared to 40-60% in most middle-income developing
countries.

feedstock replacement are shown in Table 2.4.

These figures are based on India's estimated 1985/86 petroleum product demand,
and product-specific penetration rates derived from experience in other coun-
tries. These estimates do not take into account infrastructure constraints or
the lead times needed to develop new gas markets. However, they do allow for
diminishing returns as gas infrastructure is extended into areas of lower
industrial concentration and population density. The estimates shown in
Table 2.4 do not include any allowance for additional induced demand which may
take place.
2.13     Based on these assumptions, it is estimated that gas could substitute
in the long term for about one-fourth of total petroleum product consumption
in India (8% of total commrcial energy). This level of replacement would
represent about 30 MMCMD of gas, or 9 million toe. At a 6% annual growth rate
in consumption, this would imply a potential demand for gas at a fuel oil
equivalent price of over 55 MMCMD by 1996/97.  This is in the same range as
planned production from known reserves (para. 2.06).
2.14     It would be highly speculative to estimate the potential market
for gas as a replacement for coal, given the current levels of possible
supply. In view of the long distances and hi8h ash content, the long-run
marginal cost of domestic coal delivered to the western region of India is
estimated at about US$2.50/MHBtu. Comparable costs of offshore non-associated
natural gas is estimated to be about US$2.00/MMBtu. The potential market for
western gas as a coal substitute is thus probably substantial.

E. Supply and Demand in the Western Region
2.15     Reserves and Production.  Estimated gas reserves and projected
production profiles of the various gas producing fields in the western
region are shown in Table 2.5. The Bombay High and South Bassein fields
are the most important fields by far. Production of associated gas from
Bombay High is expected to continue at 15 MMCMD through the late 19809 and to
gradually decline thereafter (Annex 2.1). The South Bassein field is expected
to produce 20 MMCMD of (non-associated) gas by 1991/92 (Annex 2.2). Onshore
gas production in Gujarat is expected to increase to about 4 MMCMD by 1988/89
(Annex 2.3). Significant production from the other western gas fields is not
expected until the mid-19909.

2.16     The planned production level of 44 MMCMD in 1994/95 may be
conservative relative to the level of gas production possible over the next
decade. Depending on the level of associated gas production at Bombay High,
the rate at which new satellite fields around Bombay High and South Bassein
are brought into production, and the rate at which South Bassein resources are
exploited, a range of production profiles could result. A lower bound is
probably about 28 MMCMD by 1994/95.
2.17     More likely, production will be higher than planned.  The gas-oil
ratio (GOR) at Bombay High may increase more than expected, with assoq>ated
gas production remaining over the 12 MMCMD level well into the 1990s._   The
South Bassein field could be exploited more quickly than presently planned, at
1/ A technical note on the production of associated gas from Bombay High is
attached as Annex 3.7.



- 16 -
a production rate of 25-30 MMCMD (depleting the reservoir, based on present
data, over about 20 years). This option would be of particular interest if
significant additional reserves are identified in new fields. An upper bound
on production based on these considerations is about 55 MMCMD.
2.18     Existing and Planned Infrastructure.  While offshore gas supply could
be as high as 55 MMCMD, the capacity of the offshore pipeline system, basad on
present planned investments, will only be about 30 MMCMD. The existing Bombay
High-Uran line has a capacity 9.5 MMCMD (currently being increased to 11
MMCMD), and the South Bassein-Hazira line has a capacity of 20 MMCMD (which
can be increased to 30 MMCMD with the addition of compression). There is a
link between these two lines, so that some excess Bombay High production can
be sent to Hazira and inland through the HBJ pipeline.
2.19     Under the proposed project an additional line of approximately
7 MMCMD capacity will be constructed from Heera to Uran, which will provide
further capacity to deliver gas from Bombay High satellite fields to the
Bombay market. ONGC has preliminary longer-term plans for a network of field
and pipeline development to deliver western region gas to Bombay and to the
Hazira/HBJ pipeline system. An investment study to identify least-cost longer
term development plans is included in the project (para. 2.49).
2.20     Most gas is presently consumed near landfall or near the onshore
fields. Onshore infrastructure is minimal. The HBJ pipeline is a major first
step in expanding the gas market from a local to a regional leviel. There are
also plans to extend an existing local gas grid in the Baroda/Ahmedabad area
in increments and link it to the HBJ pipeline to provide an integrated
transmission network to take gas from both South Bassein and onshore Gujarat
fields to consumers either in Gujarat or along the HBJ pipeline system.
2.21     Potential Markets.  A preliminary planning exereise to assess the
future market and to set priorities for gas use was carried out in 1979 by a
Working Group established by the Ministry of Petroleum. It limited its
analysis to the use of 21-27 MMCMD of offshore gas that was then expected to
constitute the future gas supply. The Working Group recommended use of
western gas principally as a fertilizer feedstock. This led to the decision
to build a group of ten gas-based fertilizer plants to supply the domestic
market and to construct the HBJ pipeline to supply the six inland plants (see
IBRD Map 19878). As more gas has been confirmed and as delays are now expected
in construction of the last three fertilizer plants, the Government has
expanded the market for western gas to include some power plants and existing
industrial plants. GAIL has also decided to extend the HBJ line to Delhi to
increase the potential for additional gas utilization; it is currently
carrying out market surveys to quantify this market potential for gas.
2.22     The quantity of associated gas which can be transmitted to Uran
for consumption in the Bombay area is currently limited by the capacity of
the Uran terminal facilities, which can handle only 8.0 MMCMD of rich
natural gas (to be increased to 10.5 MMCMD). Any gas in excess of this
amount must currently be transmitted to Hazira for consumption there or
input into the HBJ pipeline. Gas users in Bombay comprise three fertilizer
plants, several medium-sized industrial users, two power plants (MSEB and
Tata Electric, totalling 3.8-6.6 MMCMD, dependinig on demand), and a gas
cracker to be commissioned in three years. The total of these users amounts



- 17 -
to between 6 and 13 MMCMD, with actual consumption varying considerably with
seasonal demand and industrial operations. In addition to these users, ONCC
has identified small industrial users within the current gas grid as well as
additional potential commercial and domestic demand. Details are given in
Annex 2.4.
2.23     The offtake from the Gujarat gas grid consists of about 3 MMCMD by
committed consumers, including two fertilizer plants, two power plants, and a
number of industrial and commercial users. In addition, another 1.2 HMCMD
could be taken by existing fertilizer plants and 3 MMCMD by power plants on an
interruptible basis. ONGC and GAIL have identified a further potential demand
of 2.5 MMCMD from industrial, commercial, and domestic consumers. Total
potential consumption in this market is in the range of 11 MMOMCD and no
difficulty is anticipated in finding a market for gas from the Candhar field
(see Annex 2.5 for details).
2.24     Near Hazira and along the HBJ pipeline route, up to 16 MOCMD will be
used by fertilizer plants and up to 6 MMCMD by new combined-cycle power
plants. Existing plants for immediate conversion to gas could consume about 5
MMCMD of gas. The demand of other industrial and power users is estimated to
total approximately 7 MMCMD. Total potential demand for this area is thus
about 35 MMCMD, of which about 20 MMCMD is expected to come from fertilizer
and power plants. More detailed breakdown of total annual demand by potential
users is provided in Annex 2.6 and summarized in Table 2.8.
2.25     In summary, the market for western gas amounts to some 26 MMCMD from
committed consumers, a further 21 4MCMD from interruptible consumers and
16 MMCMD from additional potential users. This breakdown is summarized below
in Table 2.6.

These figures represent a preliminary estimate of the market for western gas,
however more work is required to identify the details of possible gas
consumption, the technical requirements and costs of conversion, and to
prepare users in time to take gas as it becomes available. GAIL has already
taken the first steps in this direction, with technical assistance from the
Bank, during project preparation.
2.26     The original decision to allocate the bulk of western gas supplies to
the fertilizer sector was made as a result of the recommendation of the 1979
Working Group. Based on a review of the demand/supply balance in India's
fertilizer sector, the Workio, Group proposed the establishment of ten new
1,350 tons-per-day ammonia units, six along the HBJ pipeline, and four on the
western coast.
2.27     The four plants along the coast have already been constructed.  They
consist of two pairq of ammonia and urea plants, one at Thal,  fguth of Bombay,
and owned by RCFL _ ; and one set at Hazira, owned by KRIBHC0._   All of these
facilities are presently operational. The six plants along the HBJ pipeline
are scheduled to be constructed over the next three years (Table 2.7). They
will each consume about 1.65 MMCMD of gas as feedstock and for power
generation. Construction is being undertaken by a combination of the Ministry
of Fertilizers and private sector interests, which will own and operate
several of the plants. The completion schedule for the six inland plants is
as follows:

and are expected to be completed on schedule in 1988. However, construction

that these will be significantly delayed from their original start-up dates in
1989.

2.29     As additional gas has become available, GOI has expanded the gas
market beyond fertilizer, initially by approving the construction of three
gas-based combined-cycle power plants along the HBJ pipeline. These will
consume up to 6.0 MMCMD of gqs. These plants (financing for which has also
been supported by the Bank).V will augment generating capacity in the power-
short western region, in areas where there are severe transport constraints on
the delivery of domestic coal. In addition, GOI and GAIL are now starting to
plan for additional offtake of gas by industrial users. The Bank has played a
substantial role in encouraging the government to expand the gas market. With
Bank assistance, GAIL has undertaken preliminary surveys for existing plants
which could be converted to natural gas, and the HBJ pipeline is now being
extended to Delhi, to capture the potential market there. Existing
petrochemical, power, fertilizer, and othev industrial plants have been
identified which could take up the slack in the market left by the delay in
completing the construction of the three fertilizer plants.
2.30     Given the critical importance of developing the gas market so that
there are enough users ready to justify the major investment in field and
pipeline infrastructure, the GO! has confirmed the schedule for commissioning
of the fertilizer plants, and agreed to keep the Bank informed on a regular
basis (annually) of the plans for utilizing Ras produced under the proiect,
and on progress of implementation of the fertilizer plants and conversion of
oher users (see para. 2.54). Furthermore, GO! has agreed to take appr-opriate
measures to ensure the full utilization of gas in a timely manner.
2.31     Based on the potential production of gas in the western region of
India and identified consumers, the likely supply/demand balance for HBJ gas
for selected years is summarized below in Table 2.7 (see also Annex 2.7).

2.32       From Table 2.7 it can be seen that sufficient potential demand exists
to fully utilize the net volumes of gas expected to be available in the wes-
tern region. At the same time, gas may be available in surplus if potential
users are not developed and connected, especially in the event that the three
private sector fertilizer plants are delayed. It is this concern which has
led GOI and GAIL, with the Bank's encouragement, to initiate steps to expand
the gas market beyond the fertilizer sector, and to undertake recent efforts
to identify specific consumers for rapid conversion to gas.

F. Institutional Arrangements
2.33     The Ministry of Petroleum has overall responsibility for matters of
gas development, utilization and pricing policies. The Planning Commission is
responsible for screening investment plans, and the Finance Ministry, in
consultation with other concerned Ministries, is responsible for matters of
financing and taxation. To date the task of gas policy and planning has been
undertaken by a number of ad-hoc committes, the most recent being the Gas Task
Force (GTF). The Gas Planning group in the recently established Gas Authority
of India Limited (GAIL) is now taking responsibi'ity for forecasting gas
demand, surveying markets, assessing the ecunomics of gas use, and planning
regional infrastructure development. This group also acts as Secretariat to a
new technical Gas Coordination Committee involving ONGC, OIL, and GAIL, which
brings together producers and market information to coordinate gas development
on a regional basis. At the policy level, GOI is considering establishing a
similar group under the auspices of the Planning Commission to coordinate
utilization planning and market development with gas availability.
2.34     The Oil and Natural Gas Commission currently produces, transports,
and sellr most of the natural gas in India, with the exception of the Assam
region where gas production is split between ONGC and Oil India Limited
(OIL). GAIL is to assume the gas transmission and marketing role currently
performed by both ONGC and OIL, although GAIL will initially concentrate on
HBJ pipeline operations. In addition to these agencies4 gas consumers and the
producers of alternate fuels are also involved in the debate over sub-sector
development policies and plans. These include the government departments and
companies concerned with coal, power, fertilizer, and petrochemicals.
G. Gas Sector Development Planning
2.35     The GOI's approach to the development of initial markets for natural
gas parallels the strategies adopted by the developed countries in the 1950's
and 1960's when gas first emerged as a major energy source in Europe and North
America. Major users are identified to ensure the proper location of
transmission facilities. Such major users typically account for 50-60 per
cent of pipeline capacity. Then, additional large-volume users (generally
power utilities) are identified and developed to ensure that the line is
utilized as close to capacity as possible. Once a more diversified gas market
has developed, with significant cumulative demand from high-value users, gas-
based power generation is usually scaled back for use during peak demand
periods only. Base-load power generation is then usually based on other fuels
with a lower economic cost.
2.36     Planning for gas utilization in India has proceeded during a period
of rapid change in the underlying assumptions about gas availability. Upward
revisions of gas production forecasts have overtaken the policy guidelines of
several years ago. There is a need to carefully integrate the planning of gas
field development and pipeline investments with development of the gas
market. Substantial progress has been made towards this objective with the
establishment of a gas planning capability within GAIL. However, additional
steps are required to ensure that optimal gas sector development takes
place. In particular there is a need to re-examine (i) the most economic uses
for gas in India; (ii) the best manner and timing of developing the western
gas fielda; and (iii) the specific marketing plans for South Bassein and



- 22 -
Bombay High gas over the next few years. Substantial additional amounts of
gas may become available in the western region o'er the next 5-10 years beyond
those already committed to fertilizer and combined-cycle power plants. In
view of the lead times required to develop gas customers and plan and
implement distribution infrastructure, there is a need to plan now to utilize
these potential resources.
2.37     To date gas development has been planned on the basis of large "once-
only" investments. This approach was appropriate for the initial large
discrete investments in development, such as Bombay High, South Bassein, and
the HBJ pipeline. However now that the development of a number of smaller
fields and pipeline linkages is involved, ONGC and GAIL are faced with a
larger number of project investment choices, among which the interlinkages and
tradeoffs are more complex. The aggregate investment involved is potentially
very large (about US$2 billion) and it is important that the costs and
benefits of the various options be carefully quantified.
2.38     A short-term market planning exercise of the Bombay and HBJ market
areas is also needed to ensure fullest use of available production. About 2-3
MMCMD of Bombay High gas is presently being diverted to Hazira and another 2-4
MMCMD is flared because of transmission constraints to Bombay. In addition,
given the delays in construction of the last three fertilizer plants, there
will be underutilization of western gas in the early 1990's if users are not
identified now. Although GAIL has undertaken some preliminary analysis, there
is still a need for much detailed work on the conversion and preparation of
users. An annual market plan to address these problems is also incorporated
in the proposed project (para. 2.51).
H. Gas Pricing
2.39     Gas prices should promote economic efficiency by encouraging the
optimal level of gas use and investments in potential gas-using industries,
and by giving the correct incentives to producers to find and develop gas
resources. In regions with constrained supplies of gas for the foreseeable
future, marginal replacement fuel equivalence is the correct pricing basis to
achieve these objectives. In the case of western gas, the Government's
present pricing principles are in accordance with these principles.
2.40     All gas in India has historically been produced along with crude
oil. Since most such gas, which would otherwise be flared, is sold to
consumers on a cost-plus basis, there has been no pressing need for a
comprehensive gas pricing policy. With the advent of larger volumes of
offshore associated gss from Bombay High, ONGC and the GOI have been moving
more towards replacement pricing over the last few years. As a result, a
number of different pricing levels have evolved based on contractual
arrangements negotiated at different times in different regions of the
country. For example, onshore associated gas from Gujarat has been priced as
low as Rs 355/MCM (US$0.79/MCF). This reflects the very low contractual
prices negotiated as a result of lack of alternative markets for gas at the
time of field development. Offshore associated gas has been priced between Rs
555 and Rs 2,780/MCM (US$1.24-6.20/MCF, depending on end-use. The lower
price is for interruptible supplies to power plants, and the higher price for
guaranteed supplies to fertilizer and industry. On average ONGC has received
Rs 1,428/MCM (US$3.19/MCF), just below the average fuel oil equivalent level,
over the last few years.



- 23 -
2.41     With large quantities of non-associated gas to be produced for the
first time (primarily from South Bassein), it has been recognized that there
is a need for a more comprehensive pricing policy in the western region. The
GOI has examined various policy options over the last two years, and the Bank
has maintained working discussions with the Government as the principles of
this policy have been formulated. The following set of principles with
respect to HBJ pipeline gas was developed: (a) the base price of natural gas
would be linked to the price of the fuel or feedstock replaced; (b) the price
structure should be simple to administer and to understand, and with prices to
users to be uniform along the pipeline; and (c) the pipeline operator. GAIL,
should earn d fair return on costs. Any surplus would accrue at the producer
end, where the resource rent would be taxed by the Government. These policy
principles have now been formalized into the following set of gas prices,
announced in mid 1987: (i) Rs 1400/MCK for gas at landfall points and for
onshore gas; (ii) Rs 2250/MCK for gas supplied along the HBJ pipeline; and
(iii) Rs 500 to Rs 1000/MCM in Assam, where associated gas exists in
surplus. Allowances are also made for discounts in the cases of interruptible
users, and to encourage market build-up during the initial years of new field
development. These prices are above the current import parity price of fuel
oil, but somewhat lower than the administered domestic fuel oil price, as
shown in Table 2.9.

2.42     The approach adopted by the 001 in formulating gas pricing policy is
an acceptable one. The GOI has confirmed the gas pricing principles outlined
above.
2.43     Gas pricing policy in India is important to the fertilizer sector,
which is already a major consumer of gas, and for which the largest single
share of gas from the western region is planned. The present structure of
fertilizer prices in India, based on a retention price formula to producers
and centrally fixed prices to users, is highly distorted. The Bank is
encouraging a program of price liberalization in this sector. In the
Cooperative Fertilizer Industry Project (US$302 million, approved June 28,
1986), the GOI agreed to implement a program of "Initiatives in the Fertlizer
Sector." These initiatives include the modification and rationalization of



- 24 -
the fertilizer pricing system based on internal COI reviews which are
currently ongoing in consultation with the Bank. Further reform of fertilizer
pricing is being addressed by the Bank as part of the policy discussion
associated with a forthcoming fertilizer distribution project.
I. The Role of the Bank in the Gas Sector
2.44     GOI has increasingly recognized the importance of gas as an energy
source. It is expanding the role of gas by accelerating the development of
known gas fields and expanding the use of gas not only for production of
fertilizer, petrochemicals and LPG, but also for use in power generation and
as an industrial fuel. The Bank has played an instrumental role in supporting
these initiatives by (i) encouraging rapid development of gas fields
(especially South Bassein) to replace imported petroleum products; (ii)
encouraging and assisting in the establishment of GAIL to undertake gas
planning, transmission, and marketing; (c) encouraging first the use of gas in
power generation, and then encouraging for its expansion into industrial use;
(d) encouraging the establishment of a uniform gas pricing policy on the basis
of economic principles; and (e) advising on contractual arrangements for
gas. The Bank has recently provided experts to help identify plants for
immediate conversion to gas, and to review the terms of gas sales contracts.
2.45     The Bank has materially assisted these efforts with a series of
projects including initial development of the South Bassein gas field, review
of the HBJ pipeline, and more recently, financing two of the fertilizer plants
to be constructed along the HBJ pipeline route and a combined-cycle power
project also utilizing western gas resources. Experience with the South
Bassein and HBJ projects has shown, however, a critical need to ensure that
markets and supply sources are developed in parallel, in order to maximize the
overall returns from development of the gas sector. In the past, growth of
the gas industry has been hampered by inadequate coordination between the
development of gas resources, investments in infrastructure facilities, and
development of the gas market. To ensure the efficient use of gas, these
issues need to be resolved as supplies from further development efforts come
onstream.
2.46     The proposed Western Gas Development project represents a follow-on
to the first South Bassein project in terms of expanding gas prod 'tion from
the South Bassein free gas field. In addition, it would finance suostantial
appraisal and development work of potentially significant gas resources from
other fields in the western area. The project would allow the Bank to
continue its ongoing dialogue with the GOI on natural gas sector issues.
2.47     Specifically, the Bank's dialogue under this project will focus on:
(a) Encouraging ONGC to plan investments in further field and
infrastructure development in the most cost-effective manner;
(b) Longer-term analysis of gas markets and utilization to ensure
that India derives the maximum potential benefit from the use of
gas resources;
(c) Short-term planning for utilization of quantities of gas
expected to come onstream in the near future;



- 25 -
(d) Coordinating production planning and utilization efforts; and
(c) Supporting the establishment of adequate pricing and contractual
arrangements to encourage proper use of gas.
The project will incorporate specific measures to address each of these
issues, as described below.
2.48     Production Planning.  There exist a number of alternative
possibilities for developing the various western gas fields and linking them
to market. A comprehensive study needs to be undertaken to determine the most
cost-effective means of developing western offshore and onshore gas resources
in an integrated manner. The proposed planning exercise would involve:
(a) Reviewing the reserves and potential production profiles for
each of the western region gas sources;
(b) Identifying the various development options, including the order
in which fields are developed, alternative pipeline sizes and
configurations; and field production technologies;
(c) Identifying the development and operating costs associated with
each option; and
(d) Selecting, on the basis of the demand pattern identified under
the gas utilization study, the least-cost program for developing
western gas resources over the next twenty years.
Much of the study could be undertaken by ONCC; some specialized technical
inputs for the more complex or marginal fields from domestic and/or foreign
specialized firms may be appropriate. The results of this work could then
serve as a basis for the long-term investment program in the western region of
the country.
2.49     Gas Utilization.  Given the longer-run availability of larger
quantities of western gas than originally planned, and the changes in world
prices for petroleum products and fertilizers, the. longer run strategy for gas
utilization in India needs to be reexamined with particular emphasis on the
uses for additional gas available in the western region. Such a planning
exercise would involve:
(a) Projecting high, low and medium gas supply scenarios;
(b) Identifying in more detail potential gas users in the Bombay,
Gujarat areas, and along the HBJ pipeline, the volumes of gas
they could consume, the approximate prices at which conversions
to gas would be made, and the costs of conversion, including the
infrastructure costs of serving each customer or market area;
(c) Estimating the economic value of gas in each use, taking account
of the fuel replaced and differential capital and operating
costs resulting from gas use;



- 26 -
(d) Ranking potential gas uses with respect to economic value;
(e) Determining the allocation of gas to users which results in the
greatest net economic value to the country under each gas
availability scenario; and
(f) Identifying the actions and investments required to bring new
users onstream.
2.50     The GOI confirmed that it is carrying out studies on the areas listed
above, and hat the results of such studies would be reviewed with the Bank by
June 30, 1989.
2.51     Market Planning.  There is a need to continually update detailed
market plans for the marketing of western gas for the immediate future. Such
a plan would concentrate on identifying specific additional users and
preparing plans for their connection and conversion. The OOI has agreed to
submit to the Bank an annual report on gas marketing in the western region
which will address steps necessary to ensure the connection of sufficient
users to achieve and sustain a high capacity utilization rate as quickly as
possible for western region gas, covering both associated gas from Bombay
High, gas from the Gandhar field, and gas to be supplied to the HBJ
pipeline. Such a plan would address the expected offtake by customer by year
for the coming three years, the steps and costs required to convert and
connect each customert and the progress of market development during the
current year. This report would be prepared by GAIL and ONGC and submitted to
the Bank no later than March 31 of each year during the project implementation
period.
2.52     Coordination.  It is likely and appropriate that the bulk of planning
work with respect to gas production would be undertaken by ONGC, and with
respect to gas utilization by GAIL. It is important that the preparation,
conclusions and implementation of these studies be closely coordinated. This
coordination may be achieved through the Gas Coordinating Committee or by
other appropriate institutional means. The GOI confirmed that arrangements
for such coordination had been made.
2.53     Contractual Arrangements.  In order to assure proper pricing policy
between OC1 as producer of gas and GAIL as distributor, the GOI agreed to
provide to the Bank the contractual basis upon which gas will be provided by
ONCC to GAIL. The Bank will wish to review these terms to be assured that
pricing terms provide ONGC adequate remuneration to permit it to meet its
financial covenants to the Bank and to assure the financial autonomy and
viability of GAIL.
2.55     The Bank's dialogue with the GOI in the gas sector, now extending
over almost ten years, may serve as the basis for future gas development in
other regions of India, notably in the eastern region, and for development of
resources identified by the Krishna-Godavari Exploration project. The Bank
would also broaden its dialogue with GOI on gas pricing and address issues
across the energy and industrial sectors, including the fertilizer industry.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Background and Project Objectives
3.01     Large scale production of natural gas in India first started with the
development of the Bombay High project in the mid 1970's, which is producing
substantial amounts of associated gas for the Bombay market. The free gas
field at South Bassein, just south of Bombay High off the west coast, was
! scovered in 1976, and the first phase of field development is just being
completed with Bank assistance. India is now embarking on a second phase of
development to increase gas production and treatment capacity up to its design
level of 20 MMCMD. At the same time, a number of smaller satellite oil and
gas fields have been identified offshore, including the Heera, Tapti and
Hazira structures, and onshore exploration has resulted in the discovery of an
additional gas and condensate fields at Candhar in Gujarat on the west coast.
3.02     The principal objectives of the Western Gas Development project are:
(a) to support rapid development of proven gas reserves, and at the
same time to help identify further reserves for the future;
(b) to encourage simultaneous expansion of the gas market to
effectively utilize the gas produced; and
(c) to support longer-run planning for least-cost development of gas
supply, and utilization planning to ensure gas is used in
sectors which yield the greatest economic benefit.
In particular, the project will increase production from South Bassein from
10 MMCMD to 20 MMCMD, an increase equivalent to 65,000 Bbl/d of petroleum.
Construction of a pipeline to shore from the Heera field will also permit use
of over 1 MMCMD of associated gas from this field which is presently flared
(equivalent to 6,500 Bbl/d of petroleum). Funds are provided for appraisal
and initial development of the Gandhar fieltd in Cujarat state, to produce, on
average, 2 MMCMD of gas and 0.4 mtpy of condensate. Seismic studies will
provide information on the reserves for future gas production from the Hazira
and North Tapti fields.l/ Studies are also included to plan integrated
development of the western gas fields, and to assess the economics of gas
utilization in India.
B. Project Description
3.03     The specific project components are:
(a) Phase II development, both offshore and onshoret of the South
Bassein gas field;
(b) Laying of the Reera-Uran gas pipeline;
(c) Phase I development of the Gandhar gas/condensate field;
1/ See Annex 3.7 for more detailed discussion of these fields.



- 28 -
(d) Seismic surveys of the Hazira and North Tapti fields; and
(e) Studies for longer run optimization of gas production and
utilization.
These components are discussed in further detail below.
3.04     South Bassein Phase II.  The South Bassein field, located
approximately 65 km west of Bombay in the Arabian Sea, in water depth of
57 meters, is presently estimated to have reserves of approximately 8 trillion
cubic feet (TCF), of which 6 TCF (equivalent to over 2 billion barrels of oil)
are recoverable (Annexes 3.1 and 3.L). The field is being developed in two
phases. Phase I, presently being implemented, will provide production of
10 MMCMD.
3.05     Phase II development would double gas production to 20 M)GMD (Annex
3.3). This requires installation of: (a) a second gas processing platform
with gas and condensate treatment facilities for the additional production
capacity, together with power generation facilities, workshops and a control
center; (b) a nine-slot wellhead platform; (c) a living quarters platform for
124 men; (d) a flare structure; (e) tie lines to Phase I facilities; (f) the
drilling of 27 development wells; and (g) the construction of onshore gas
processing facilities and an onshore terminal at Hazira.
3.06     Gas and condensate produced from the South Bassein field is
dehydrated and transmitted to shore through a 36" gas line, already
constructed under Phase I, the capacity of which is sufficient to handle the
full 20 MMCMD production foreseen from Phases I and II. The landfall point of
the line is Hazira. At Hazira the gas is treated by passing it through
"sweetening" (desulfurization) and other facilities to prepare the gas fot
transmission through the HBJ line. Condensate is separated out and split into
LPG and other products. A conceptual diagram of the Hazira plant is attached
as Annex 3.4. A map of the Western Gas Development Area (IBRD Map No. 19877)
can be found at the end of this report. Onshore Hazira facilities also
include a storage facility, a single-buoy mooring system with a 16" loading
line to allow shipment of natural gas liquids by tanker, and a waste water
treatment plant for treatment of process water.
3.07     Heera-Uran Gas Pipeline.  The Heera oitfield, located 80 km southeast
of Bombay High and about 55 km south of South Bassein, was discovered in 1977
and covers an area of about 10 by 18 kms. Heera is being developed in three
phases. Phase I, recently completed, included installation of initial
production facilities, resulting in crude production of 45,000 Bbl and 1.2
MMCMD of associated gas. The gas is presently being flared since there is no
pipeline linking the production complex to shore.
3.08     Phase II, currently being undertaken by ONGC, will include water
injection facilities to maintain oil production, and construction of crude and
gas pipelines to allow direct transfer of crude and gas to shore. The Western
Gas Development project incorporates laying of a 24", 100 km submarine gas
pipeline to take the associated gas to the Uran terminal which serves the
Bombay market. This will eliminate the flaring of about 1.2 MMCMD (Annex 3.5)
of natural gas (equivalent to about 390,000 tpy of fuel oil) at an estimated
annual saving of $46 million.



- 29 -
3.09     Candhar.  The recently discovered Gandhar field, located on the
shores of the Gulf of Cambay, Gujarat state, will be appraised and
developed. The drilling program for Gandhar consists of 40 appraisal and 75
development wells (Annex 3.6). The Gandhar appraisal plan is quite well
advanced; twenty wells are already committed and ten well locations already
identified. Technical notes on the drilling program for these fields are
included in Annex 3.7. In addition, the project includes surface facilities
for treatment of the gas and condensate, and transmission to market.
3.10     North Tapti and Hazira.  Hazira is an offshore gas field, discovered
in 1969 in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Bombay, west of the town of
Surat. Only two wells have been drilled in Hazira. The discovery well
produced gas at a fairly good rate. A second well, drilled on the onshore
part, was water-bearing. North Tapti is also an offshore gas field,
discovered in 1983 in the Gulf of Cambay, southwest of Hazira field. Since
the discovery well, which produced gas at a good rate, no further drilling has
been carried out.
3.11     As part of its long-term program of developing the Bombay offshore
satellite fields, ONGC will evaluate the hydrocarbon potential of the Hazira
and North Tapti fields. The evaluation program includes seismic surveys,
seismic data interpretation and some appraisal drilling. Both fields require
the application of modern geophysical methods such as high resolution and/or
3-D seismic surveys which would help resolve the size and prospectiveness of
the structure and determine the appraisal drilling program. Both fields
require about 500 line-kms of seismic data acquisition. This seismic program
is expected to be very effective since, to date, the highly prospective areas
in the Gulf of Cambay have not been surveyed with specialized geophysical
techniques.
3.12     Studies.  Funds have been included for long-term development plans
for both optimum production and utilization of western gas resources. A
shorter-term marketing plan would also be undertaken on an annual basis, to
identify users for gas. This plan would identify prospective consumers of gas
within the HBJ corridor area and the other areas contiguous to that where gas
from Bombay High and Heera is landed. The production and utilization studies,
to be undertaken separately, will each require an estimated 20 man-months of
work plus approximately 5 man-months to coordinate results, at an estimated
US$10,000 per man-month. Preliminary descriptions of studies are given in
paras. 2.49-2.52.
C. Project Implementation
3.13     The organizational arrangement adopted by ONGC is to create projecc
teams under a manager for each project area, which report to one of ONGC's
Senior Group General Managers in Bombay, depending on the dominant activity in
that area. These teams are backed up during all phases of project design and
implementation by the lead consultant, Engineering India Limited (EIL). EIL
is the largest and most experienced project engineering firm in the oil and
gas production and processing field in India. EIL, in turn, has collaboration
and back-up arrangements with experienced foreign engineering firms.
3.14     Maximum use of turnkey contracting allows ONCC to supervise a large
number of projects with limited staff resources. A typical project team is



- 30 -
shown in Annex 4.1. In addition to technical staff, project teams are also
assigned both an experienced financial supervisor and a materials procurement
and planning coordinator.
3.15     Implementation of the South Bassein and Heera components of the
project will be the responsibility of ONGC's Regional Office in Bombay. This
office, which was initially set up to implement the Bombay Offshore Project,
and then continued to implement Phase I of the South Bassein development, has
demonstrated its ability to manage large-scale offshore projects and oil and
gas operations effectively. Its management team has received exposure to all
phases of offshore development. As a result of this experience, it has built
up a well-structured organization with sufficient trained staff to handle the
work program represented by the proposed project.
3.16     Implementation of the Gandhar component is the responsibility of
ONGC's field office in Baroda, which is in charge of implementation of all
onshore activities in the western region. Senior management of these projects
will, however, be based in New Delhi; careful coordination between ONGC's
Bombay and Baroda offices needs to be assured. ONCC has confirmed the
establishment of ProJect Implementation Units in Bombay (for the Heera and
South Bassein components) and in Baroda (for the Candhar component); in
addition ONCC has agreed to identify a coordinator for the purposes of the
Bank project to provide liaison and coordination with both the_Bombay and
Baroda units.
3.17     The Baroda office of ONCC has a relative shortage of experienced
middle management in technical areas of drilling, and lacks adequate equipment
for onshore drilling owing to the higher priority given by ONGC to offshore
development activities. Most of the development drilling for Gandhar will
therefore be undertaken by drilling contractors. The project includes
measures to strengthen ONGC's onshore drilling capabilities by financing most
of the oil services contracts required from specialized service companies, and
technical assistance from consulting firms specialized in oil and gas field
operations.
3.18     In order to allow the Bank to monitor project activities (Annexes 4.2
and 4.3), assurances will be obtained from ONGC at negotiations that regular
progress reports will be provided on a basis to be agreed upon, the scope of
which will include procurement, construction, gas production and sales, and
performance of contractors as well as consultants. Particular emphasis will
be placed on reporting of drilling activities in Gandhar. In addition, ONGC
will prepare a Project Completion Report within six months of project
completion.
D. Project Cost
3.19     Total cost of the project is estimated at approximately US$1,354
million including physical and price contingencies, and including taxes and
custom duties, estimated at approximately US$192 million, on imported
materials and equipment. The proposed Bank loan of US$295 million represents
25.4% of total project cost, and 38.31 of estimated total foreign exchange
expenditures.

3.20       Estimated project costs are summarized in table 3.1.   An estimated
cost breakdown of project expenditures by year appears in Annex 4.4. Costs
are based on actual recent contract prices in the area, which are in line with
worldwide price trends.

3.21     The cost estimates are based on mid-1987 price levels.  Physical
contingencies are 101 of base costs. Price contingencies are based on the
following expected price increases: 7% in 1988, 4% in 1989, and 3X for the
period 1990-93 for imported goods and services; 81 in 1987 and 1988, 71 in
1989, and 61 per annum for the period 1990-93 for domestic goods and
services. Taxes and customs duties on imported goods and services have been
estimated based on estimated average rates. Interest during construction has
not been included in project costs; ONGC is expected to charge such interest
expense against income as incurred.
E. Financing Plan and Items for Bank Financing
3.22     In the past it has been possible for ONGC to meet most of the local
cost component of its investment needs from internally generated funds and
this situation is expected to continue. ONCC does not, however, earn foreign
exchange resources directly. These are raised through suppliers' credits,
allocations of foreign exchange resources from the central government, and
overseas loans, including loans from the World Bank. More recently, the
strategy of the GOI has been to diversify the sources of financing to ONGC.
As ONCC has become a prime borrower of its own in recent years, COI has
authorized ONGC to borrow directly from foreign sources.
3.23     On major procurement items ONCC requests financing proposals as bid
documents are tendered. In the case of the proposed Western Gas Development
Project, the Government has worked closely with Bank staff to identify those
project components most suitable for Bank financing and to separate out
components for which other financing is considered more appropriate. It was
in this manner, for example, that a bid and financing package offered by the
Government of Italy and Snam Progetti for the BPB platform complex (part of
the South Bassein offshore facilities and originally considered for Bank
financing) was secured.
3.24     Important components of the proposed project, including notably the
offshore platforms, are of interest to export credit agencies for financing.
Many other components, however, such as pipe-laying and drilling contracts,
are not normally financed from such sources. In the case of pipe-laying,
pipelaying barges are usually not registered under the flag of the
contractor's nationality, preventing eligibility for export credit
financing. These factors have been taken into account in selecting the
specific items proposed for Bank financing. In addition, the Bank has sought
out items for which the Bank's supervisory role may be of particular value in
terms of technical assistance (such as drilling contracts, engineering, and
management contracts), and where disbursement may be particularly rapid (such
as pipelaying and gas processing facilities). A Bank loan in the amount of
US$295 million to the Government of India is proposed, for 20 years including
5 years of grace, to be onlent to O0CC at a rate of at least 15X per annum.
The Government would bear both the foreign exchange and interest rate risks.



- 33 -
3.25     Based on estimates of likely financing sources, including borrowings
by ONCC in the international capital market, the following financing plan has
been prepared:

Total                          583.6    770.3   1,353.9     100.0
3.26     Because the proposed project comprises part of ONGC's ongoing
investment program, commercial financing for the project will be arranged by
0NGC as part of its ongoing company-wide financing arrangements. Export
credit arrangements for financing of the South Bassein Phase II "BPB" platform
awarded to Snam Progetti have been arranged, but other export and suppliers'
credits are estimates only. The Bank has been assisting both export credit
agencies and commercial banks interested in cofinancing the Western Gas
Project. The estimates shown are based on Bank staff review of goods and
equipment for which cofinancing is considered likely.
3.27     Items which would be financed by the Bank fall broadly into the
following categories:
(a)  Facilities at the Hazira onshore processing plant;
(b)  The Heera-Uran gas pipeline;
(c)  Drilling materials, equipment, and well services (for
development drilling in the South Bassein field and appraisal
drilling in the Hasira and Gandhar fields);
(d)  Surface facilities, including gathering lines, at Candhar;
(e)  Seismic surveys (at Hazira and North Tapti); and
(f)  Engineering and other consultancy services.
3.28     For the onshore Hasira processing plant, items include two condensate
fractionation units, two gas sweetening (desulphurization) plants, two
dewpoint depression units, two sulphur recovery units, a digital distribution
control center, and an NGL terminal.
3.29     Drilling materials and equipment include casing and tubing, drilling
and coring units, mud chemicals, oil well cement and additives, drilling and
production wellheads, casing accessories, stimulation chemicals and materials,
and downhole drilling and completion equipment. Drilling services include



- 34 -
drilling rig hire charges and specialized services such as drilling mud;
cementing, drill stem, and production testing; electric logging; mud logging;
directional drilling; well stimulation; and completion and offshore logistical
support services (including diving).
3.30      Surface facilities at Gandhar include field stations, gathering and
transmission lines. Engineering and consultancies will include project
management and design assistance as well as the gas production and utilization
studies described elsewhere in this report.

3.32     About US$800 million worth of goods and services for the project will
be procured in accordance with international competitive bidding (ICB)
procedures, of which US$270 million will be Bank-financed. About US$274
million will be procured under local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures.
Other procedures (e.g. limited international bidding and direct contracting)
will apply to approximately US$88 million, of which US$25 million would be
Bank-financed. Because there are only a limited number of qualified
contractors and suppliers, ONGC will be permitted to procure by LIB all well-
related services and equipment required for special operations relating to
wireline and well logging, mud logging, well cementing and stimulation, well
testing, directional drilling, coring, fishing, drilling and blow-out control
regardless of the value of each package. All qualified bidders will be
invited to bid on these packages. In addition, any package valued at one
million or below that ONCC considers to be time critical may be procured by
LIB. Direct contracting will also be permitted for equipment and spare parts
that are proprietary or to ensure standardization and compatibility with
existing equipment and facilities. The aggregate of all LIB and direct
contracting packages to be financed by the Bank under the project shall not
exceed US$25 million. Consulting services will be obtained in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.
3.33     It is estimated that Bank financing will cover approximately thirty
tender packages. Prior Bank review of all essential procurement documentation
will be required for packages estimated to cost more than one million.
Packages estimated at one million or less will be subject to the Bank's review
after contract award.
3.34     For items to be financed by the Bank, the Bank's standard domestic
preference provisions will, at ONGC's option, be accepted for the evaluation
and comparison of bids submitted for the project. The total value of
contracts procured under LIB and direct contracting is not expected to exceed
about US$25 million. Consultancy services will be procured in accordance with
Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. ONGC agreed to make every
effort to provide to the Bank the documents requiring prior Bank review at
least one month before the date they are scheduled to be released.
3.35     Althug:ft ONGC has carried out much of its drilling operations and
technical well services using its own equipment and personnel, it has agreed
with the Bank's recommendation to utilize the services of specialized firms
for most of the propoedd project. ONGC has, however, proposed using force
account for about 40 appraisal wells in the Candhar field. This has been
agreed to for the following reasons: (a) ONGC can undertake the appraisal
drilling operations, based on review of the drilling load on ONCC and the need
for timely project implementation, provided auxiliary drilling services are
made available through specialized firms; (b) ONGC would use the same
established field management teams and crews to continue similar operations
after completion of the project; (c) transfer of technology and skills in oil
field activities such as drilling is better accomplished if ONCC works side by
side with foreign contractors which will be mobilized for the development
drilling phase; and (d) the alternative of contracting appraisal drilling
would likely be substantially costlier. ONGC has been drilling and producing
in the basin for over twenty years, during which it has drilled more than
1,400 wells. It has the experience and management capability that are needed
to undertake a drilling program of the scope proposed.



- 36 -
3.36     Given the advanced stage of project preparation, ONCC has already
started the procurement process for the gas processing facilities at Hasira.
As a result, and depending on the pace with which final contracts can be
concluded, up to US$25 million of retroactive financing by the Bank may be
required. At ONGC's request, the Bank has reviewed all the packages for which
advance contracting might apply and has found them in accordance with Bank
Guidelines.
G. Disbursements
3.37     Phasing of the estimated disbursements of the proposed Bank loan is
shown in detail in Annex 4.5 and summarized in Table 3.4 below:
Table 3.4
Projected Phasing of ExpendItures
Year 1    Year 2     Year 3     Year 4     Year 5    Year 6
FY88      FY89       FY90       FY91       FY92      FY93
Annual       10        3 90       S 95       5 60       $ 35      S 5
Cumulative   $10       S100       5195       $255       $290      $295
Disbursement of the proposed Bank loan has been estimated on the basis of the
loan becoming effective by the end of FY88. Projected disbursement extend
over five years. Bank disbursement experience with all energy projects is
that 991 is disbursed in six years; for the smaller number of oil projects,
100% has been disbursed within five and one-half years. In view of the
advanced level of preparation of this project, inclusion of advance
procurement for contracts already signed, the "second phase" character of two
of the major project components, and the provision for standardization of
procurement tender documents for Bank-financed components, the projected
disbursement period is considered realistic. Based on the estimated schedule
of expenditures, allowance for disbursement lag and contingencies, a closing
date for the loan of June 30, 1994 has been agreed.

3.44      Disbursement of the proposed Bank loan of US$295 million would be
made as summarized in Table 3.5 below:

exchange costs.
R. Ecological Aspects and Safety
3.38      Process equipment in fields which will be subjected to water
injection, such as Heera, are designed for "sour" (high sulfur content)
service to allow for the possibility that anaerobic bacteria, present in
seawater, may result in higher sulfur content when interacting with oil.
Rules regarding return of effluent water into the sea and gases into the
atmosphere are governed by Indian MINAS regulations (Minimum National
Standards) which are as strict or stricter than those of the North Sea
countries.
3.39     Water injected into oil fields, like Bombay High, is treated with
biocides. So far no biocides have been detected in formation water produced
with the oil, but this may vary from field to field. ONGC is alert to the
possibility that eventually biocides may appear in the formation water of
Heera and monitors its quality regularly, so that appropriate measures can be
taken if necessary.
3.40      The gas treatment facilities at the Hazira gas terminal will be
provided with a waste water treatment plant which will treat process water
from the sweetening (desulfurization) facilities.  Discharge of sulphuric
gases into the atmosphere will be minimal, since hydrogen sulfide will be
converted to sulphur in a sulphur recovery plant.



-38 -
3.41     The design of wells to be drilled conforms to the recommended
practices of the American Petroleum Institute (API) as well as to accepted oil
field norms and standards. ONGC has acquired throughout the past several
years a satisfaccory record in this area. Onshore well locations are selected
to avoid close proximity to habitation and water wells, if and when they are
present. Subsurface formation water and surface source water will be
protected following oil industry drilling standards.
3.42     Well effluents (oil, gas, and produced formation water), chemicals
used in production operations (methyl, alcohol, surfactants and ammonia) and
drilling fluids, constitute a possible source of pollution while drilling.
These are treated offshore in closed systems to minimize losses by leakage,
and onshore by containment in specially constructed pits. All residual waste
chemicals and well effluents will be burned or injected into water disposal
wells to prevent pollution of fresh water sources. ONCC will ascertain that
contractors mobilized in connection with the proposed project will contain and
clean up any drilling iluid or chemicals and reclaim any portion of land which
is not required for production operation such as access roads and locations of
abandoned wells.
3.43     ONGC follows the recommendations of Lloyds of London as primary
insurer of the Commission regarding structural integrity of equipment, hazard
control and personnel safety. In addition, ONCC follows applicable Indian
regulations and codes, which in general conform with other internationally
applied codes. These regulations are reflected in the design and construction
specifications issued in all turnkey bid documents.
3.44     ONGC observes all of the safety standards of the American Bureau of
Shipping (ABS), Britain's Lloyds Shipping and Norway's Det borske Veritas
(DNV) with regard to offshore drilling and production platforms. Each
platform is equipped with sufficient survival craft to accommodate all of the
men at work at any given time. In addition, India is a signatory to the
Safety of Life at Sea (Solas) convention; the coast guard fleet is responsible
for meeting Solas norms.
IV. THE BORROWER: ONCC
A. Organization and Management: Introduction
4.01     The Oil and Natural Gas Commission was established by the Government
of India in 1959 to explore and develop petroleum resources in India outside
the areas already being prospected in the eastern part of the country. The
determination to explore these areas was based upon the conclusions of Indian
geologists and confirmed by a panel of international experts. OCC is a
government-owned corporation established by the Oil & Natural Gas Commission
Act of l¶39 to plan, promote, organize and implement programs for the
development of oil and natural gas resources and the production and sale of
oil and natural gas products.
4.02     ONGC has grown to become the principal entity which explores for and
develops oil and natural gas resources in India. Its activities are mainly
the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. ONGC does not
participate in downstream activities such as petroleum refining or



- 39 -
distribution and retailing of refined products.l/ ONGC's revenues are derived
from the sale of its production of oil, natural gas, liquified petroleum gas
and natural gas liquids. The major part of ONGC's expenditures, other than
for normal operating costs, is for exploration and development.
4.03     For the fiscal year ended March 31, 1987, ONGC's gross crude oil
production amounted to 27.9 million tons. This represented about 90% of
India's total domestic production of crude oil for the same period. The
balance was produced by OIL, a government-owned company which operates mainly
in the state of Assam, in the eastern part of the country.
B. Organization
4.04     The 1959 ONGC Act provides that the Commission shall consist of a
Chairman and not less than two, but not more than eight, Members appointed by
the Government for a term not exceeding five years at a time (Annex 5.1).
Members are eligible for reappointment. All decisions of the Commisuion must
be approved by a majority of Members. The Commission sets policies, manages
the activities, and develops the plans and budgets of ONCC.
4.05     At present, the Commission consists of six Members from within ONGC
and two additional Members representing the Ministry of Finance and the
Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. Until recently, the six internal Members
were designated, respectively, Operations, Exploration, Drilling, Technical,
Finance, and Personnel. In view of the rapid increase in importance of gas
production and gas operations, the Member Operations has recently been changed
to Member Natural Gas, responsible for formulation and promulgation of
policies and strategies regarding development of natural gas in addition to
oil production. The former Chairman of GAIL has been appointed to this
position. The presence of this new Member in ONGC should help to assure
better coordination of planning in the gas sector between ONGC as the
producing entity, GAIL as the primary gas transportation entity, and gas
users. An outline of the structure and responsibilities of the Members of
ONGC is attached as Annex 5.1.
4.06     The Chief Operating Executive of ONGC is Colonel S.P. Wahi, who
assumed the position of Chairman in October, 1981. The Chairman is appointed
for a five-year term. The Government has announced that Col. Wahi will serve
for an additional one-year period pending designation of a new Chairman for
this office.
C. Institutional Asoects
4.07     The Bank has been closely involved in the petroleum and gas sector in
India with ONGC. The commission has been the beneficiary of five Bank loans
totalling U8$1,180 million since 1979. This period has been one of rapid
growth and one during which major adjustments have been necessary in
organizational structure and management approach.
I/ The principal distributor of oil products is the Indian Oil Corporation;
the principal distributor of natural gas will be the Gas Authority of
India Limited.



- 40 -
4.08     Certain organizational strains and inefficiencies have inevitably
resulted from ONGC'S rapid growth. Recently, a reorganization was implemented
based on a functional structure for the Commission and a regional or "common
basin" approach for the operating organization. In this approach all
operations in a given basin are integrated; formerly, offshore and onshore
operations in the same basin had been handled under separate organizations.
The Bank has also encouraged ONGC's increasing use of private sector
contractors and consultants in order to focus managerial and technical
manpower on essential functions and to reduce capital expenditure
requirements, as well as to accelerate the transfer of technology.
4.09     This approach has been adopted both by the Government and ONCC as a
matter of policy. Thus in July of this year OCC announced that it wished to
sell over 30 offshore supply vessels, as well as support and standby vessels,
worth an estimated Rs 1,800 million (approximately US$140 million). After the
Bank approved the first loan to ONCC in 1977, ONGC began borrowing directly
from the international financial markets (Annex 5.2) and has raised about
US$1.5 billion from these sources. The Commission is also considering schemes
to attract private sector involvement, including financing, in the future
appraisal and development of certain offshore fields. ONCC is also working
closely with the Government of India to implement the GOI's policy of offering
increased acreage to international companies to expedite the country's total
exploration effort (para. 1.27).
4.10     During the period of the Bank's involvement with ONCC, management
systems have also been improved. Considerable investment has been made in
recent years in strengthening the managerial information system and improving
communications among the several regional production centers. Comprehensive
reports are provided monthly to management. Important portions of the
Commission's accounting systems have been computerized. The Commission has
submitted timely and complete progress and financial reports to the Bank in
compliance with loan agreements.
4.11     ONCC has grown rapidly and has been successful at implementing
complex and difficult new technologies in offshore drilling in India. There
has been an extensive dialogue on technical issues between the Bank and ONCC
staff. Bank staff recommendations have, in specific situations, been
followed. The financing of portions of the estimated foreign ext Inge cost of
many of the drilling operations included in the Western Gas Development
Project will provide a basis for continuing this important dialogue.
D. Financial Asoects: Past Results
4.12     ONGC's operations over the past five years have expanded very
rapidly, ieflecting the brisk build-up of its offshore operations, notably
Bombay High. A summary of the Commission's recent operating results (Annexes
5.3 to 5.5) is shown in Table 4.1.

4.13     ONCC's revenues have increased almost ten-fold over the past ten
years. Despite significant contributions by ONGC to the public sector (gross
taxes and royalties to the government, plus income taxes and dividends) which
have represented as much as 501 of earnings, the Commission has still
generated substantial cash flow (net income retained plus depreciation). This
has increased to about Rs 19 billion (US$1.5 billion) in 1987. ONGC is
presently the largest public sector company in India in terms of capital
employed and net profits, and together with the Indian Oil Corporation, among
the largest Indian companies in terms of sales.
4.14     ONCC's sound financial performance has been the result both of
pricing and taxing policy by the Government of India and relatively low-cost
operations by the company. Domestic crude prices, on which ONGC revenues are
based, have been maintained to provide adequate returns to investment and
sufficient internal cash generation to meet a subatantial portion of future
investments; ONGC presently receives US$18.70/Bbl of crude produced before
royalties (para 1.35). The company has been able to utilize net cash flows as
a significant source of investment funds. At the same time, operating costs
have been kept around 101 of net revenues.

E. Operating Performance
4.16      It is difficult to make comparisons between oil companies which
reveal in a meaningful way the relative success of any individual company in
undertaking its operations. This is particuarly true in the case of ONGC, a
relatively new company which has grown rapidly, and which has adapted well to
new and difficult offshore technologies on a large scale. Furthermore, the
local costs of a company like ONCC operating in India may vary markedly from
those of international oil companies operating in other parts of the world.



- 43 -
4.17     ONGC operates quite profitably, with relatively low operating
costs. The company produces approximately 570,000 Bbl/d of petroleum
(13 Bbl/d per employee). Total annual investments have averaged approximately
US$1.5 billion equivalent. One common basis for comparison of the cost of
producing petroleum is investment cost per daily barrel produced. This
measure reflects total investment and costs after exploration (and before
transport) per additional daily barrel of oil production. Development
investment in high-cost offshore sources, among which the North Sea is
typical, often average US$15,000-20,000 per daily barrel. More typical
offshore costs are in the US$10,000 range. ONGC's total development
investment costs (of which offshore development comprises by far the largest
component) are in the range of US$12,000-15,000 per daily barrel. This
average combines relatively low development costs for Bombay High (estimated
to be below US$10,000 per daily barrel) with higher average costs elsewhere.
4.18     Using this same parameter for the major project components, estimated
development costs range from US$6,250 for South Bassein Phase II development
(in terms of oil equivalent of gas) and US$25,000 for the Gandhar field. The
low cost of incremental production from South Bassein does not, of course,
include the (relatively expensive) cost of transporting gas by pipeline. The
relatively high development costs of the Gandhar field reflect the fact that
only the initial phases of production are being caken into account.
4.19     While offshore costs are generally greater than onshore costs, the
Arabian sea offshore Bombay is neither deep (averaging 60 meters) nor
turbulent. As a result, production costs from these fields have been
relatively low. ONGC's total operating expenses, including overhead and
depreciation, are approximately US$1 billion equivalent for production of
about 200 million barrels annually; this represents average total operating
costs per barrel of approximately US$5. Direct cash costs (i.e. excluding
depreciation bV including overhead) have run between one-quarter and one-
third of this." These figures are based onLy on oil production; gas sales,
in any event, have not yet been significant. These costs are in line with
international industry costs and reflect both the economies deriving from peak
production from the Bombay High oilfield and low manpower costs in India.
P. Financial Projections
4.20     The Bank has built a financial model based on past and projected
operations, announced government policy with respect to selling prices, the
Commission's present financial structure, and projected investment outlays --
including implementation of the proposed Western Gas Development Project.
Details of this financial model, including assumptionst are attached as
Annexes 5.3 to 5.11.
l/ Depreciation tends to be an overstated cost because of the lag effect of
new production coming onstream in the company with growing investment
as well as production.

G. ONGC's Investment Proram
4.23      Implementation of the Western Gas Development Project will take place
largely within the Seventh Five Year Plan (1985-1990). During the Seventh
Plan Period, ONGC's overall investment program (Annex 5.9) has been set at
Rs 121 billion (approximately US$9.8 billion), or an average of about Rs 24
billion (US$2 billion) annually. Total cost of the proposed project,
excluding interest during construction, is about US$1.35 billion and
represents about 141 of total Seventh Plan outlays projected for ONGC.
4.24      From the sources and uses of funds projections shown in Table 4.5 it
can be seen that ONGC will be able to rely largely on internally generated
funds for its investment outlays for both capital equipment and exploration
and development. The projections do not, however, include investments greater
than those officially anticipated by ONGC, which would require additional
resources. In the past, investments by ONGC have been undertaken at a rate
significantly higher than originally planned as a result of further appraisal
of fields. An important need which remains is meeting the foreign exchange
component of ONGC's investment program. In the case of offshore work such as
the proposed project, the foreign exchange requirements comprise a significant



- 46 -
portion (more than half) of total outlays. ONGC will continue to seek, at
regular intervals during the project implementation period, foreign currency
loans, untied to procurement packages, to help finance its overall investment
program. The timing of such corporate borrowings will depend on the financial
market conditions as well as on the foreign exchange needs of the company.
Parts of these international borrowings are expected to be used towards the
financing of the proposed project to the extent needed to cover the direct
foreign exchange cost not financed by Exim Bank, export/suppliers' credits and
the proposed Bank loan. In the first quarter of 1987, ONGC borrowed from the
international capital markets a total of about US$260 million comprising DM
150 million and two Yen loans of about Y 25 billion.
H. Financial Analysis of the Project
4.25     Calculations of the financial rates of return for the three major
project components (South Bassein, Heera, and Candhar) are shown in Annexes
5.10 and 5.11. These calculations are made based on ONGC selling prices and
the capital and operating cost estimates shown in the project cost table
(including physical contingencies and local taxes). The calculations are in
constant 1987 terms. They are also made before and after income taxes and
assume that the project components pay the full tax liabilities computed using
the project's own interest costs and depreciation charges.
4.26     The results show a financial rate of return before income taxes for
the South Bassein Phase II component of 66% and an after tax return of 44%.
The high return is primarily due to the incremental nature of the Phase II
development which takes advantage of the existing infrastructure (i.e.
offshore gas pipeline) already provided for under Phase I. To a lesser
extent, the relatively high financial return is also due to ONGC gas sales
prices being slightly above international equivalents (US$2.83/MCF); the
energy-equivalent price of gas corresponding to US$15/Bbl crude is
approximately US$2.50lMCF.
4.27     The financial return from the Heera investment is about 26% before
and 131 after taxes. The financial return on the Gandhar project component is
17% before and 101 after taxes. The financial return exceeds ONGC's cost of
capital in real terms. Financial return on the total of the major project
components is a satisfactory 47% before income taxes and 29X after taxes.
I. Financial Covenants
4.28     The following agreements have been reached:
(a)   With the Government that it will:
carry out, from time to time, a review of the prices
of crude oil and natural gas paid to ONGC, and shall
set such prices at a level needed to enable ONGC,
under conditions of efficient operation, to meet its
debt service requirements, maintain adequate working
capital and finance a substantial portion of its
proposed capital investments;
(b)   With the ONCC that it will:



- 47 -
(i)   submit annually to the GOI an analysis of its
financial situation as a basis for setting ONGC's
selling prices, and in addition submit to the GOI
analysis of any major investment project indicating
the level of prices required for ONGC to earn a
satisfactory return on such major investment and on
any related subsequent major developments;
(ii) maintain its current ratio at 1.2 times or higher,
its debt-service coverage ratio at 1.5 times or
higher, and its debt to equity ratio at not more than
60:40; and
(iii) have its financial accounts audited by an independent
auditor acceptable to the Bank, and will submit its
audited accounts to the Bank within nine months of
the end of each fiscal year, as well as quarterly
unaudited financial reports in such a scope and
format satisfactory to the Bank.
Similar provisions were agreed to by GOI and ONCC under earlier petroleum
projects. These covenants have been complied with under past loans and have
in part provided a basis for past revisions to petroleum prices implemented by
the GOI.
V. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Project Benefits
5.01     The proposed project will result in the production of substantial
quantities of natural gas, which will substitute for liquid petroleum
products, thus reducing India's petroleum import requirements and the
consequent drain on foreign exchange; and this is its principal
justification. It is estimated that over the life of the project 63 billion
cubic meters of natural gas will be produced, plus 4 million tons of
condensate and 11 million tons of petroleum products extracted from gas. This
is equivalent in total to approximately 66 million tons of oil, with an
estimated net value to the country of US$2.5 billion.

At peak production, the project components yield a total output of over 4.3
mtpy of crude oil equivalent, corresponding to about one-third of current
petroleum imports. In addition, the planning studies associated with the
project should lead to a substantially more rapid and cost-effective
exploitation of India's gas resources in uses which yield the country greatest
benefit.
5.03     Natural gas has been valued on the basis of the fuel which it
replaces, delivered at the point of use. For the purposes of project
evaluation, it has been conservatively assumed that all gas replaces fuel oil,
the lowest-valued replacement. International prices of fuel oil were forecast
based on a range of possible crude oil prices, and adjusted for international
transport to arrive at a CIF value Bombay. Gas used at the coast is valued at
the thermal equivalence value of fuel oil CIF Bombay; gas used inland is
valued at the thermal equivalence of fuel oil CIF Bombay plus transport
inland.
5.04     On the basis of gas demand and utilization plans, actual gas use is
expected to be about 501 as fuel oil replacement in boilers and power
generation, and 501 as feedstock for fertilizer production. Although in the
latter use gas would replace naphtha, the economic viability of naphtha-based
fertilizer plants is uncertain in the present international economic
environment, based on the projected relative international prices of naphtha
and fertilizer. Accordingly it has been assumed that in the absence of
natural gas, the fertilizer plants would not operate rather than utilize
naphtha. Thus for the purpose of project evaluation, the net benefit to the
country of gas consumed is calculated based on the corresponding value of fuel
oil imports only and not on the value of naphtha exports foregone.

5.05     Crude oil prices are taken at $l8/Bbl (in constant terms), the
current price of which is not expected to change for some time, and at $12/Bbl
and $25 Bbl, which are considered reasonable low and high price scenarios. As
a worst-case, given inherent uncertainties in world oil prices, the project
was also evaluated at a constant price of US$10/Bbl. For the purposes of
calculating international product prices, it has been assumed that constant
refinery margins are maintained over the forecasting period. This methodology
results in economic values for natural gas ranging from US$54/I4CN
(US$l.53/mcf) to US$164/l4CH (US$4.68/mcf), as summarised in Table 5.2 below.

Source: Bank staff estimates
Given the expected geographic mix of gase use, this results In a weighted-
average value of gas as a fuel oil replacement of about IJS$3.25/mcf at a crude
price of $l8IBbl. (The value of natural gas as a naphtha replacement would be
substantially higher, at about $4.00/mcf at crude prices of US$18/ShI). The
detailed assumptions underlying valuation of gas and products are given in
Annex 6.1.
5.06 When converting to natural gas there are additional economic benefits
in the form of reduced storage and handling co&ts, reduced maintenance costs
as well as lower pollution. Further benefits result from the increased
thermal efficiency of natural gas relative to liquid fuels, which typically
results in a 51-10% increase in benef3ts depending on use and type of
burner. Although the magnitude of these savings varies from industry to
industry, their total impact can be substantial. The net effect of these
considerations is that project benefits as currently measured, using direct
thermal equivalence of gas for fuel oil, tend to be conservative.
5.07     The South Bassein component of the project will also produce
substantial quantities of LPC and natural gas liquids (NGL, also known as
natural gasoline), both of which are imported in India. Both of these
conunodities have been valued at their estimated CIF prices as shown in Table
5.3 below.

5.08     The Gandhar project component will also result in the production of
condensate which is equivalent to very light crude oil. Condensate production
is valued on the basis of the assumed crude prices FOB Singapore, adjusted for
quality as well as international transport to Bombay. These components are
also evaluated at a constant oil price of US$10/Bbl.
B. Project Costs
5.09     Project cost estimates are in constant 1987 dollars, net of taxes and
duties, but inclusive of 101 physical contingencies. Operating costs are
estimated at 5% per annum of capital costs. This is a common estimate in the
offshore oil industry in general, and on the high side for onshore production,
especially in India because of low prevailing wage levels. Sensitivity
analysis has been performed assuming all costs up to 501 higher.
C. Economic Analysis
5.10     South Bassein.  The outputs of the South Bassein (Phase II) component
of the project consist of rich natural gas, and LPC and NGL at the outlet
point of the Hazira treatment facilities. Plateau production (reached by
1992) will be about 9 MMCMD of rich gas, 500 tons per day (tpd) of LPG, and
1,400 tpd of NGL. This is equivalent to about 3.5 million tons of petroleum
products annually (91 of current consumption), and the net benefits to the
country are in the order of US$450 million per year (Annex 6.2). Rich gas has
been valued on the basis of its replacement value ex-Hasira, net of any
downstream shrinkage and ignoring inland transport benefits and costs, which
would, it is estimated, increase the value of benefits by about 5X.
5.11     The economic internal rate of return on this component is about 82Z,
with a net present value of US$2.3 billion. The incremental investment in
Phase II of South Bassein yields such high returns principally as a result of
the large sunk costs in pipeline infrastructure under the first South Bassein
project. The rate of return is still 531 under the worst-case scenario of oil
prices at US$10/Bbl. The average (discounted) cost of gas produced under this
coiuponent is estimated at about US$0.52/mcf, equivalent on an energy basis to
an oil price of US$3.16/Bbl; oil prices would thus have to fall to approxi-
mately this level before the project ceased to be viable.
5.12     To assess the full costs and benefits of the entire South Bassein gas
development program, economic analysis was also undertaken for the integrated



- 51 -
package of South Bassein and HBJ pipeline investments (Annex 6.3). This shows
that the whole program yields an economic rate of return of 28%. The cost of
gas is US$0.81/mcf ex-Hazira, and US$1.79/mcf ex-HBJ (attributing all costs to
gas, and excluding the additional benefits of NCL and LPG). The difference in
ex-Hazira and ex-HBJ costs is attributable to the cost of the HBJ pipeline.
At an oil price of US$10/Bbl, the integrated South Bassein-HBJ project still
yields a net present value of US$0.5 billion, and a 17% economic rate of
return.
5.13     A scenario more likely than that of a sustained low price of oil at
US$10/Bbl is a delay in the construction of the last three fertilizer plants
planned along the HBJ pipeline. While other gas users are being sought to
substitute offtake (Table 5.4), gas utilization could be substantially reduced
for several years in the event that an alternative market is not developed
sufficiently rapidly. In order to test the economic implications of such
underutilization with respect to the proposed South Bassein project component,
calculations were made based on a two-year delay in gas offtake. The result
is a decrease in the net present value of the South Bassein phase II
investments to US$1.4 billion; a net cost to the country of US$0.9 billion in
benefits foregone.

5.13     Heera.  The benefits of the Heira component will be about 1 MMCMD of
associated natural gas delivered onshore Bombay which would otherwise be
flared. The value of the gas saved will cover the costs of the pipeline
within two years. The total net present value of the benefits is estimated at
US$72 million, yielding an economic return of 36% (Annex 6.4). If oil prices
are assumed to remain at US$10/Bbl, the rate of return from Heera becomes
negative. However, the investment in bringing associated gas to shore remains
viable down to US$12/Bbl oil prices, since the average incremental cost of
production and delivery is only US$2.00/MCF. These estimates tend to
understate the benefits of the Heera-Uran pipeline, since it has been over-
sized to carry gas from other satellite fields to market as they are developed
over the next ten years.
5.14     Gandhar.  Analysis based on preliminary estimates of the production
levels from the Gandhar field show an average net benefit to the country of
about $70 million per year by the early 1990's (about half of which is gas



- 52 -
replacement of petroleum products, and half condensate). This yields an
economic rate of return of about 661 (Annex 6.5). This falls to 7X under the
US$10/Bbl crude price scenario. The estimated average cost of production of
oil and oil equivalent gas is US$10.20/Bbl. However, these resu,lts are based
only on projected production from the initial stages of field development.
Substantially more wc,lls are planned to determine the full extent of reserves,
and if additional reserves are confirmed, average production costs from the
field would drop accordingly. In addition, the appraisal drilling included
under the project will yield valuable information essential to planning
optimal field development in the longer run, and no value has been attached to
this.
5.15     The economic rate of return for the aggregate of subprojects (South
Bassein Phase II, Heera and Gandhar) is about 721.
D. Project Risks
5.16     Potential risks to the proposed project fall into three categories:
(i) technical, (ii) market; and (iii) oil price uncertainty. Regarding
technical risk, any petroleum project has certain risks inherent to the
process of drilling and producing oil and gas. Exploration risk is
essentially not present since all major project components consist of
developing established fields. Technical risks are greater for offshore than
for onshore projects. However, ONGC has accumulated considerable expertise
and established a good track record in both onshore and offshore production.
The project has provided for expert assistance in drillingt where necessary,
and a number of technical studies have been undertaken to confirm the extent
of reserves. The major technical risk arises from the uncertainty about
reservoir performance given that the fields being developed are new and have
no production history. Conservative well productivity assumptions have been
used.
5.17     Poor planning and coordination of market development with
installation of the project facilities would result in underutilization of
capacity. Some underutilization is unavoidable as new capacity is first
brought outstream; in addition, potential users tend to require that supply
capacity be ready before committing to purchase agreements. Most important,
however, is that planning for major users such as fertilizer and power be
carefully coordinated with increased supply capacity. Sensitivity analysis
indicates that although project economics remain sound under delayed offtake
scenario, losses of potential benefits from delayed offtake would be
substantial. Project conditionality has been drawn up minimize such losses.
5.18     Declines in the international price of petroleum and petroleum
products (and hence in the substitution value of natural gas) remain an
unavoidable risk. However, sensitivity analyses indicate that only one
project component, Heera, becomes economically unviable under "worst case"
conditions defined as crude oil declining to US$10/Bbl and remaining there in
constant terms. This situation is highly regarded as unlikely, and the main
South Bassein component remains viable at oil prices as low as $4/Bbl. The
returns on other project components remain satisfactory under all, other
foreseeable conditions (Annex 6.6).

WESTERN GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
TECHNICAL NOTES ON CHARACTERISTICS OF WESTERN REGION FIELDS
AND ONGC DEVELOPMENT PLANS
Bombey High Oil Field and Associated Gas Production
1.       The Bombay High oil field is also a substantial source of associated
gas, which plays an important role in the long-term planning of gas supplies
in the Western Region. At present, some 15 MMCMD is produced, of which 5
MMCMD a day is flared. This volume of flared gas represents almost US$500,000
a day of crude equivalent at today's prices (US$15/Bbl). Flaring is planned
to be eliminated as new industrial complexes and power generation facilities
come onstream in the Bombay area and additional users are converted from
alternative fuels.
2.       The Gas-Oil Ratio, or GOR, is 324 CM/CM for Bombay High North and 192
CM/CM for Bombay High South. Though the latter is acceptable and in line with
predicted solution ratios, the former is too high and indicates that gas-cap
gas is being produced, which could impair maximum oil recovery from this part
of the field. ONCC has been aware of the need to correct this situation and
installed water injection facilities in the north of the field, which have
been operational since March 1984. Water injection in the south has been
delayed, but is expected to be operational early 1987. The results of water
injection in the north have been encouraging: reservoir pressure has risen 6-8
bars and the GOR's are stabilizing. Only four wells showed water breakthrough
and three had to be shut in because of high GOR's.
3.       If GOR continue to stabilize, then Bank estimates are thaL gas should
be produced at a plateau rate of approximately 14.5 MMCMD gross for the next
five years or 12.5 MMCMD net (after meeting gas demand for field production
requirements). ONGC's predictions are substantially above earlier forecasts
of 10 MCMD. In order to transfer the additional gas production to shore,
ONGC is restaging the compressors on the BHN platform to produce a higher
discharge pressure. ONGC's assumption for planning purposes is that any extra
gas would find a ready market in the Bombay industrial area and that,
accordingly, demand for gas from the south Bassein field would not likely be
affected by higher production from Bombay High.
South Bassein Field
4.       The South Bassein field is an offshore natural gas reservoir located
approximately 65 km west of Bombay. The gas reservoir is a structurally high
area situated on the continental shelf between the Bombay High oil field to
the west and the city of Bombay to the east.

Page 2 of 8
S.       Exploratory drilling has defined the area as a symetrical anticlinal
feature having two well defined gas reservoirs overlying each other, both
trending in a north-northwest, south-southeastern direction. The reservoir is
of the Lower Oligocene and Upper Eocene age. The upper gas zone is at
approximately 1,650 meters subsea and the lower zone at approximately 1,700
meters subsea. The water depth in the area is about 30 meters. The total
area of the reservoir is approximately 210 sq. km. with an average gas pay
thickness of 41 meters.
6.       As of July 1986, seven exploratory wells have been drilled, of which
six encounered commercial gas from the Bassein limestone. Five of these
wells were exploration wells and have since been plugged and abandoned. The
entire South Bassein structure is underlain by a thin oil column and water.
This oil column is very thin and would be extremely difficult to produce.
7.       ONGC has one platform in place with nine wells drilled to a depth of
1,450 meters. Only one well, BA-l, on this platform has been tested at a gas
rate of 9 MMCFD from the lower zone. The other wells require additional
drilling and completion before production tests can be performed. ONGC plans
to develop the area with four platforms (nine wells each) for a total of 36
wells. Due to the possibility of water coning, 20 wells will be drilled in
the central area of thick gas column (70 to 100 meters) and will be restricted
to 700 MCMD (25 MMCFD), and 400 MCMD (14 MMCFD).  Water production is forecast
to commence in ten years, and this production would increase to a rate of
4,050 CMD (2,500 Bbl/d) after 20 years.
8.       The major concern associated with this reservoir is the potential of
water coning. ONGC has had a coning model study prepared for the South
Bassein field and has followed the recommendations of well locations and
production restrictions as suggested in the study. ONGC has also prepared in-
house studies using a coning model and is using the results of these studies
to optimize production from the field.
Heera Oil Field
9.       The Heera oil field, located about 60 km southeast of the South
Bassein gas field, was discovered in 1977. Its major structure, Teera South,
is wedge-shaped, with the thin edge of the wedge slanted up-dip t the east.
Oil is found in three horizons. The major accumulation is in the Bassein
limestone (Oilgocene-Middle-Eocene) at 1,650 meters depth. The structure has
an average porosity of 15% and average water saturation of 35%.
10.      Oil reserves in place have been e:. imated at 125 MHmt of a high
quality 38° API sweet crude. These reserves have been calculated for the
Bassein limestone on a volumetric basis, based on an isopach map of net pay.
The net pay thicknesses were selected using an 81 porosity cut-off and a 701
water saturation cut-off. This approach is realistic.



- 73 -                       Annex 3.7
Page 3 of 8
11.      Since oil produced from Heera is undersaturated, the field appears to
have no gas cap. The oil-water contact has not been clearly established.
With no gas cap and no apparent waterdrive, pressure maintenance is required
in order to reach reasonable rates of recovery. A study by the French
petroleum company, Compagnie Francaise du Petrole (CFP) suggested the need for
water injection to enhance recovery from the field. ONCC undertook a 15-year
performance simulation using a 3-D model. These studies confirm that water
injection would have to be started after recovering approximately 3% of oil in
place, that is, after approximately two years of production at 24,000 Bbl/d.
The ONCC study indicates that the optimum method of field development is
pressure maintenance by pattern injection in the central zone, and a row of
injectors on the periphery on the down-dip side.
12.      The objective of phase II is (i) to implement this water injection
scheme; (ii) to provide a crude pipeline to Uran so that the present practice
of crude oil evacuation by tanker can be eliminated; and (iii) to provide gas
treatment and compression facilities and to lay a gas pipeline to Uran, so
that flaring of associated gas can be stopped; gas facilities will be located
on a separate platform.
13.      Gas processing will consist of dehydration and dew point depression
facilities to meet specifications required for safe pipeline transport to
shore. The gas will be compressed to 900 psi pipeline-inlet pressure in a
first stage. Part of the gas will subsequently be raised to a pressure of
1,900 psi and distributed through a pipeline network to all oil wells. By
leading the high pressure gas to the bottom of the well, the upward movement
of the resulting gas bubbles effectively reduces downhole pressure and
improves well performance. The gas used for gas lift purposes returns with
the oil via production facilities to the gas processing plant where it is
jointly treated with the associated gas produced, and recirculated after
recompression. Gas lift will be essential to maintain plateau oil production,
as the presence of water in the oil increases as a result of water
injection. The resultant higher specific gravity of the oil-water mix would
increase the back pressure in the well, reducing flow further without the gas
lift.
14.     O0CC has designed all production and gas processing facilities to be
capable of handling hydrogen sulfide, if necessary. This is a precaution
against the potential formation of hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen sulfide
compounds in the oil-bearing structure, which often occurs when anaerobic
bacteria in sea water come in contact with oil, an environment in which they
can proliferate. Although sea water is treated with biocides before injection
in an effort to prevent growth of such bacteria, this method is not infallible
and, accordingly, process design to allow for the possibility of higher sulfur
content at slightly higher cost is appropriate and justified.
15.      The proposed 24" gas line, to follow the same course as the oil line,
will eliminate flaring of associated gas at the present rate of 1.2 MMCMD and
at a future plateau rate of 0.8 MMCMD. For these amounts of gas, the proposed
gas line, with a capacity of over 5 MMCMD (with compression), would be



- 74 -                     Annex 3.7
Page 4 of 8
considerably oversized.  However, the pipeline can be completed about one-year
earlier than gas compression on the gas processing platform can be installed
and made operational, and this will allow flaring of gas from Heera to be
stopped one-year earlier, saving some 400 MMCM of associated gas. During this
first year, the gas line will be operated at low pressure. The value of gas
saved, almost US$40 million (based on oil equivalent value, with crude at
US$15/Bbl), more than exceeds the cost of doubling the diameter of the
pipeline (from 12" to 24"). The Heera gasoline will also be a component of
ONGC's strategic Western Offshore Integration Project, which is funded by GOI
with the objective of safeguarding the uninterrupted supply of India's major
hydrocarbon resources from the offshore fields.
The Gandhar Field
16.      In April 1984, a discovery was made at Gandhar, onshore in Gujarat
state adjacent to the eastern shore of the Gulf of Cambay, about 85 km SW of
Baroda and 75 km from the Ankleshwar field, the principal producing area in
the southern portion of the Cambay Basin. A large part of the Gandhar field
is in tidal-stept mud flats and in a contiguous shoal area. Its extension may
well continue offshore beneath the shallow waters of the Gulf, requiring mat-
type shallow water jack-up rigs for development. Since discovery, five
appraisal wells (all p-oductive) have been drilled and data from these wells,
in addition to the original well, is available.
17.      The Gandhar wells have established eight reservoir sands which yield
volatile oil with high gas saturation (that is, Gandhar is similar for all
practical purposes to a gas/condensate field). Free gas caps on these
reservoirs are highly probable, but gas-oil contacts have not yet been
established. Down-dip oil-water contacts have been established in several of
the sands and thus each is expected to have individual gas-oil and oil-water
contacts, and be entirely separate one from the other. Thus far, a productive
zone has been established between 2,8OO-3,100 m depth in an area representing
140 m of structural relief. No limits to up-dip or down-dip production have
yet been established, although recent offshore seismic results in the Gulf of
Cambay indicate an up-dip limit of the overall productive interval. This
strongly suggests that there exists a favorable band of production where the
up-dip pinchout of reservoir sands relative to structural position is
optimal. Up-dip from this optimum area, the productive reservoirs will be
thinner and mostly gas productive, while down-dip from the area most
reservoirs will be thicker and predominantly water-bearing. Drilling to date
is not sufficient to determine the width of the optimum area or its trend.
18.      The volatile oil in the reservoirs is 45-50° API (specific gravity is
0.80) and is gas-saturated at approximately 350 GM/CM (1,950 CF/Bbl) at a
reservoir pressure of 4,300 psi, normal for production from this depth. The
reservoir intervals suspected of being gas-bearing yield associated liquids of
52-55' API (specific gravity 0.77) with gas-liquid ratios of 2,500 CM/CM
(14,000 CF/Bbl, equal to 70 Bbl condensate/MMCF). With proper completion, the
oil reservoirs would be capable of producing 500 Bbl/d or more on a sustained
basis. Oil completions with significant formation damage will perform as gas
wells.



Annex 3.7

19.      Data available to date suggests wells in the oil production area will
delelop recoverable reserves of the order of 1.6MM Bbl oil and 5.5 BCF gas per
km , while wells in the up-dip gas-prone area will levelop reserves of the
order of 9 BCF gas and 0.35MM Bbl condensate per km . Wells d ewn-dip of the
oil productive area may yield 0.8MM Bbl and 2.2 BCF gas per km . Ultimate
reserves associated with the pinchout trend are impossible to estimate at this
time, but could be very large. In fact, it may be that more prior discoveries
in ip of the oil productive area may yield 0.8MM Bbl and 2.2 BCF gas per
km . Ultimate reserves associated with the pinchout trend are impossible to
estimate at this time, but could be very large. In fact, it may be that more
prior discoveries in the South Cambay Basin are associated with the trends
identified with the Candhar discovery, including the Ankleshwar field itself
(with estimated recoverable reserves in the range of 600MM Bbl).
20.      The Candhar field is at its initial appraisal stage.  Currently, four
ONGC-owned and operated drilling rigs are drilling delineation wells. Four
rigs are in Gandhar where six wells have been completed as gas, volatile oil
producers and condensate producers.
21.      In light of the appraisal well testing results and the geological
survey studies, the Zandhar field may be India's largest discovery after
Bombay High. ONCC is setting up a task force to prepare detailed plans for
development of both fields.

22.      The Candhar field is not yet delineated.  The geological knowledge of
its configuration is still quite limited. The field is at the start-up phase
of appraisal and it is very difficult to evaluate the size and the extent of
the resources associated with their discovery.

23.      OYGC's estimates for proved initial petroleum reserves in place,
recoverable and production rate are currently as follows:
Estimated Reserves and Productlon: Gandhar Field

Oil In Place                                        8.6 MMmt (10.2 MMCM)

Non-Associated Gas (CM0)                    24 MCM for 10 yrs
24.      ONGC's proved reserves and production rate est mates are
conservative. Proved plus probable estimates are Bank staff estimates based
on the proposed program. Final proved plus probable reserves may be
considerably larger. Wells drilled to date have been evaluated through drill
stem and short-term production testing using a 5-1/2" casing size and 2-7/8"
tubing size, both of which are restrictive. With appropriate well design and
completion practices, in Candhar a daily sustained production rate averaging
500 Bbl/d of liquid and 5o,ooo CMD of gas may likely be obtained for the first
four years or so.
25.      Given the substantial amount of liquid to be produced, ONGC has
decided to convert the testing phase into an early production system during
which gas would be flared and liquids trucked to the nearest refinery. This
early production program will allow better understanding of reservoir
performance and adequate well completion design.

26.      Four drilling rigs are currently assigned to the delineation
program. The same rig fleet would be maintained throughout the appraisal
phase, which may last until 1988. In general, the strategy of the appraisal
program is designed to fully assess the hydrocarbon potential of the Middle
Eocene formation and to provide better understanding of the structural trend
of the fields and their relationship with existing fields in the Cambay Basin
in order to establish a sound basis for estimating the production potential,
the recoverable reserves and, finally, the size of the production facilities.
27.      Concurrently, ONGC is actively preparing a development program for
this field. A first development phase, consisting of about 50 wells, of which
35 would be production wells and 15 water injection wells, is planned to begin
in 1988 in Gandhar. The first development wells would be located where the
reservoir is most liquid-productive in the previously appraised area. The
program is being designed to ascertain optimum liquid production and is
flexible enough to allow for shifting the emphasis from liquid to gas
production when changes occur within the program, as might be required by well
results. It is also conceived as a minimum program for a field where there is
some evidence of large gas, condensate and volatile oil reserves. All of the
wells will be drilled with the Middle Eocene as the objective, to about 3,000
meters. To implement this program, ONCC is preparing, with the consent of
GOI, to mobilize specialized drilling contractors with five rigs.
Hazira and North Tapti Fields
28.      Hazira is an offshore gas field, discovered in 1969 in the shallow
waters of the Gulf of Cambay. A small portion of the field continues north,
under the shoal areas and farther onshore near Hazira town. Only two wells
have been drilled in Hazira. The discovery well produced gas at a fairly good
rate. A second well, drilled on the onshore part, was water-bearing. North
Tapti is also an offshore gas field, discovered in 1983 in the Gulf of Cambay,
southwest of Hazira field. Since the discovery well, which produced gas at a
good rate, no further drilling has been carried out.
29.      Both fields produce from an early to a middle Miocene sandstone
formation, in both cases, on a structural anticline. The producing sandstone
was encountered in the discovery wells at about 1,160 m depth in Hazira and
560 m depth in North Tapti with several hydrocarbon-bearing layers within an
average gross thi-k-tneus of 60 m aed 130 m, respectivelwl   fn rho hAg4@ if
existing data, the size of Hazira would be about 20 sq km and North Tapti
about 37 sq km. On the basis of existing geophysical, geological and
discovery well data studies, ONGC's forecast is to produce up to 0.6 MMCMD of
gas from Hazira and 0.4 MMCMD of gas from North Tapti, with seven wells in
each field.
30.      Based on the limited geological and geophysical data available, the
following main characteristics of Hazira and North Tapti have been tentatively
established:

Maximum Vertical Closure             70 m           200 m
31.      There is no seismic control data for the offshore part of Hazira,
which is presumed to close seaward.  The existing seismic data is old and in
addition it was surveyed from varying distances and alignments because of the
difficult environment - shallow water with sand bars and tidal mud flats with
strong sea currents - it is of poor quality. ONGC's forecasts are based
primarily on flow data from the discovery wells. Hazira produced about
236,000 CMD of gas and a 1/2" choke at a flowing pressure of about 83 bars
(1,170 psi) and North Tapti produced about 130,000 CMD of gas on a 1/2" choke
at a flowing pressure of about 40 bars (600 psi).
32.      As part of its long term program of developing the Bombay offshore
satellite fields, ONGC will evaluate the hydrocarbon potential of the Hazira
and North Tapti fields. The evaluation program includes seismic surveys,
seismic data interpretation and some appraisal drilling. Both fields require
the application of modern geophysical methods such as high resolution and/or
3-D seismic surveys which would help resolve the size and prospectiveness of
the structure and determine the appraisal drilling program. High resolution
seismic would help identify the Miocene formation limit, delineate more
precisely the main faults and fault controlled traps, and outline the onshore
extent of the Hasira structure. The main objective of the 3-D seismic would
be to identify and help map the various prospective sand layers of the
Miocene. Given the difficult environment, a large part of the seismic data
acquisition would be by streamer and teleseis, particularly over the tidal and
shoal areas. Both fields require about 500 line-kms of seismic data
acquisition. This seismic program is expected to be very effective since, to
date. the hiahly prospective areas in the Gulf of Cambay have not been
surveyed with specialized geophysical techniques.
33.      With regard to appraisal drilling, ONC intends to drill three
appraisal wells on each structure on the basis of the seismic data
interpretation. While the final well locations will be determined by the
seismic results, OCC is already proposing to drill one well on the
southeastern flank of each structure. ONGC's geophysical program is
appropriate but appraisal drilling would better be postponed until a thorough
review of the results of the seismic program. While Hazira may be highly
prospective, the North Tapti field, as a result of the shallow depth and low
pressure, could deplete quite rapidly. A positive aspect of North Tapti is
that the structure could be very large and contain a correspondingly large
volume of gas.
