Al. Executive Summary
A1.1 Summary of Key Elements
This Environmental Impact Assessment concludes that a new sanitary engineered landfill
located at Moringiin Davaa is the most environmentally sustainable option for solid waste
disposal for the Municipality of Ulaanbaatar.
The facility would replace the three existing landfill operations at Dari Ekh, Ulaan Chuluut, and
Moringiin Davaa (to the North of the proposed site). The new landfill would commence operation
in 1999/2000 and would accept domestic, commercial, and industrial refuse. The advantages of
the proposed site over the existing sites and other alternative landfill sites are as follows:
1. It is located downstream of the city area and the city water supply intake areas
2. The site drains towards the south-west away from any catchments used for water
intakes
3. The site allows easy diversion of rainfall runoff and interception and collection of
leachate
4. The site contains soil and rock aggregates suitable for road building and general
construction work and therefore some of the landfilling costs could be offset by the
commercial sale of these quarry products
Contractor's vehicles, approved commercial tipping vehicles, private vehicles, and approved
scavengers will have access to the landfill tipping face. The site has operated as a quarry for
road construction materials. Approximately 10% of the site has been worked previously for such
purposes.
Two transfer stations are proposed for construction in Ulaanbaatar, one in the industrial area and
one in the Bayanzurkh area. These transfer stations will accept refuse from contractor's and
private vehicles. Recycling facilities will be provided at the transfer stations.
Alternative sites and technologies have been considered.
Alternative landfill sites have been considered, however Moringiin Davaa is the only site which
does not violate any of the exclusion criteria used in assessing the suitability of landfill sites.
Alternatives to landfills have also been investigated in the solid waste study. These alternatives
include pit burning and incineration. Overall it was concluded that an engineered landfill would be
the most cost effective and environmentally sensitive solution.
The proposed landfill will have a long life.
The landfill will have a total void volume of 3.9 million cubic metres, of which 3.4 million cubic
metres will be refuse. Assuming that the refuse is not compacted, this will provide a life of some 10
years. If the refuse is compacted, using a purpose-built landfill compactor, then the landfill will
have a life of around 25 years. Current refuse generation rates have been adopted for predicting
the landfill life. The impacts of increasing population and increased recycling will generally cancel
out. These volumes and lives will ensure that the landfill mound will only be taken to a height
compatible with the surrounding topography.
The landfill operation can be integrated with quarrying activities.
Geotechnical drilling and testing indicates that materials suitable for both road building and
general building construction work, in particular sandstone gravels and loam are present over most
of the site. These materials are a valuable resource and they can be excavated and stockpiled for
use by the City or for sale to contractors thereby offsetting some of the operating costs of the
6



landfilling operation. The quarry would be operated such that a sloping base will eventually be
provided throughout the quarry area. This is a requirement for effective leachate management.
The basic landfilling operation is as follows:
*  intercept and divert upstream surface water catchments around the proposed landfilling
area
*  excavate soil and rock to grades which allow the interception and collection of leachate
*  prepare the walls to provide stable perimeter batters
*  place incoming refuse in compacted 3 metre lift thicknesses supplemented with the
provision of daily soil cover
*  shape and seal the completed landform to effectively shed rainwater
*  develop a vegetative cover over the completed landform to control erosion
The site would be developed in 10 stages. This would allow for timely and cost effective
installation of a leachate collection systems and also stormwater diversion requirements.
The site geology has been investigated by borehole drilling across the site.
Five boreholes were drilled on the site ranging in depth from 4.2 to 6.0 metres (see Appendix l1l).
Infiltration tests were carried out on the various soils and gravels indicating infiltration rates of 0.5
to 35 metres per day. The sandstone mass is considered impermeable. The site would be
progressively developed through 10 stages. As one stage is being used for landfilling, future
stages will be excavated to provide cover material and also gravels and loam for commercial sale.
The base of the future stages will be excavated in accordance with the development plan.
Surface water will be diverted around the landfill,
Diversion drains will be constructed to divert rainwater runoff around the landfill area. The only
rainwater flow on site will therefore be that failing directly on the site This reduced volume of
rainfall runoff will be managed in the following ways:
*  preparing and filling the overall site in 10 stages such that rainfall falling on yet unfilled
areas will be shed directly off site without contacting waste
*  each progressive staged filling area will be at the head or top of the overall landfill area
*  each progressive staged filled landform will be shaped to shed surface water
*  intermediate and final soil cover will be used to shed surface water away from the waste fill
operational area
*  each stage will be progressively bunded to divert rainwater runoff.
The existing environment is already disturbed.
Impact on flora and fauna will be insignificant. There is now very little vegetation on the site. The
site is already disturbed in terms of vehicles and excavation activities.
Cover material requirements.
The required quantity of cover material is around 200,000 cubic metres. This compares with the
estimated volume of topsoil of approximately 35,000 cubic metres. The balance of cover material
will be will be sourced from the sandy gravels and loam gravels of which there is more than
*               required on site..
Leachate control will ensure that no surface or ground water downstream of the landfill is
contaminated as a result of the landfilling operations.
7



Leachate from beneath the site will be eliminated by ensuring that at every stage of the landfill
operation, drainage is provided both laterally and longitudinally across the site. Lateral movement
of any leachate will be encouraged by grading the base of the site to central valley and
intercepting this seepage in leachate drains. These drains will lead to a leachate interception
drain at the toe of the landfill area. Any leachate reaching this interception drain will be diverted to
a treatment pond for anaerobic treatment, aerobic stabilisation, and evaporation. Groundwater
quality will be monitored before and after the operation commences.
The landfill will be serviced by transfer stations.
Refuse will be deposited at the transfer stations in the city area and then transferred to the landfill
site by 30m3 compactor trucks. There will be opportunities for recycling at the transfer stations as
bins for specific recyclable materials will be provided and there would be no restrictions on access
to the transfer stations with the exception of hazardous and special wastes such as toxic materials,
hospital wastes and general industrial wastes not suitable for recycling or landfill disposal.
An environmental management plan has been developed for the site.
The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) covers all phases of the proposed development from
pre-construction to rehabilitation. The main element of the EMP is a checklist for the operator and
monitoring systems particularly for emissions such as leachate and stormwater runoff.
Community inputs
Concerns have been expressed by the Bio-complex Company which relies upon a specific area
around the complex being suitable for grazing stock without pollution of the catchment waters or
soils.  The Municipality has received approval from  Environment Control Department of
Ulaambaatar for the siting of the landfill within the Restricted Area' which had been defined in
Government Resolution No 165.

A3. Description of Proposal
A3.1 Site location
The proposed site at Moringiin Davaa is located approximately 26 kilometres by road south vtest of
Suhkbaatar Square in Ulaanbaatar on the Altanbulag road. Figure A3.1 - Locality Plan shows
the location of the site in relation to the central business district of Ulaanbaatar.
The proposed site is approximately 70 hectares in area.
A3.2 Property Description
The property has no legal description at this time. Mongolian Government Legislation consisting
of the Land Law of Mongolia (April, 1995), and the Resolution of the Mongolian Government No
143 on Implementation Measures of the Land Law (August 8, 1995) were to be followed by
implementing regulations and by-laws to be approved by the local administrations throughout the
country. These implementing regulations are currently being drafted.
A3.3 The Proposed Use of the Site
The site is proposed to be used for the disposal of domestic, commercial and industrial wastes by
sanitary landfill method. Associated uses on the site will include provision for the housing of plant
and equipment, staff amenities, and other facilities normally associated with large landfills.
Hard rock extraction and gravel and soil excavation will be undertaken during the filling of the site
with refuse. Therefore the landfill has been designed to accommodate the workings of the quarry.
A3.4 Planning Context
The proposed site does not come under any land use planning regulations. The site has operated
as a quarry and there are several quarries within 1 kilometre of the site. Otherwise the general
area is used for grazing purposes.
A3.5 Alternatives
A3.5.1 Alternatives to Landfill Methodology
A sanitary landfill is the most cost-effective system of solid waste disposal for most urban areas in
developing countries, (Ref. 1). Alternative systems such as composting and incineration cost 2-3
times and 5-10 times more respectively.
Composting
Composting is a very basic and natural biochemical process which breaks down the putrescible
fraction of a waste stream. It has potential for reducing the quantities of domestic waste for
disposal at a landfill if a large proportion of compostable material is found in the solid waste. In the
case of Ulaanbaatar the proportion of compostable material is relatively small and therefore this
alternative is not an option.
Incineration
Incineration of waste would considerably reduce the volume of waste for landfilling. A large facility
would be needed to burn waste material, thus converting carbon and hydrogen compounds to
carbon dioxide, water, and other residues.
10



, ne negative side of incineration is the need to sort the waste stream prior to burning as not all
waste material can be burnt. The most significant disadvantage is the generation of exhaust
gases (some potentially harmful gases). Also, specialist knowledge is required to operate and
maintain an incineration facility which adds considerably to the cost of this alternative. For these
reasons incineration is not considered a viable option for Ulaanbaatar
A3.5.2 Alternative Landfill Sites Other sites that were considered were the existing landfill sites
at Dari Ekh and Ulaan Chuliuut and areas nearby to those sites but in different rain catchments as
shown in Figure A2.1-General Locality Plan. All of these alternative sites were excluded for the
following reasons, to a greater or lesser degree:
*  continuing soil and water contamination impossible to stop without major expensive
remedial works
.  increasing impacts on nearby residential areas in terms of dust, odour, noise, and
appearance
*  access road construction very costly due to difficult terrain and extra length
*  increasing heavy traffic through minor roads in residential areas.
The Moringiin Davaa site presents an excellent opportunity to combine two noxious industries
within the one site with minimum impact, and largely with a beneficial outcome. Quarrying
activities would create a large depression at the site, however with the establishment of an
appropriately engineered landfill the depression can be filled and the site eventually restored to
topography which conforms to areas nearby.
A3.6 Concept Design of Transfer Stations
Two transfer stations are proposed for construction in the Ulaarhaatar area as shown on Figure
A2.1-General Locality Plan. The transfer stations would receive waste from all areas of the city
with the exception of hazardous wastes, hospital waste, and industrial waste unsuitable for
recycling or landfill.
Figure A3.2-Transfer Station shows a concept layout suitable for location within the city area.
The transfer station includes:
*  separate roads for transfer trucks and private vehicles
*  bitumen sealed internal roads
*  gatehouse
*  elevated general rubbish dumping area for private vehicles
*  recycling area
*  low-sided roll on/roll off bins for recyclables
*  weigh - bridge site as possible future installation

A4. Operation of the Landfill
The City of Ulaanbaatar is currently served by three solid waste landfill disposal facilities; Dari Ekh,
Ulaan Chuluut, and Moringiin Davaa (different area from that proposed in this report). The new site
at Moringiin Davaa will ultimately be the main waste disposal facility for Ulaanbaatar accepting
municipal wastes for c isposal including domestic and commercial wastes.
A4.1 Volumes of Waste Disposed
Estimates of the amounts of solid waste generated in apartment and ger areas are shown in Table
A4.1 and Table A4.2 Solid Waste Collection and Disposal: Apartments and Ger Areas.
These estimates are based on assumptions of the collection capacity of the solid waste Collection
Contractor: General Maintenance Company. Other factors such as the payment of the collection
levy by residents, the level of indiscriminate dumping, and collection truck availability will influence
the quantities of solid waste disposed at a given time. For the purposes of estimating truck
capacities, an amount of 6700m (2010 tonne) per week (uncompacted) has been used. This
amount has also been used in calculations of the Moringiin Davaa site capacity with an assumed
compaction factor of three hundred percent. This compaction factor would result in a density of
about 900kg/m3 which is considered conservative in terms of volume calculations.
A4.2 Types of Waste Accepted at the Landfill
Items unacceptable for disposal at the proposed landfill, Moringiin Davaa are:
e  dangerous goods such as explosives
*  radioactive wastes
*                   *  hazardous wastes such as toxic chemicals
*  large volumes of liquid wastes
*  hot loads at greater than 500 C
Other wastes that may be acceptable at the proposed Moringiin Davaa landfill but should be
addressed separately include:
* asbestos
* 'sharps' from hospitals, veterinary, and research or other places
* dead animals
* pathogenic wastes
These wastes which will be addressed separately will be disposed in accordance with accepted
standard World Health Organisation procedures.
Hazardous and toxic wastes will be limited to the receipt of empty pesticide containers and
asbestos. The area where asbestos is deposited is to be identified with the date of deposition,
quantity, origin, and name of contractor.
Animal carcasses and obnoxious wastes wii be tipped in front of the landfill face and covered
immediately. These wastes should not be placed on the base of the landfill. 'Sharps' will be
disposed of in an area set aside for pesticide container disposal.
Disposal of large quantities of liquid wastes and soluble chemical wastes will not be permitted.
Grease trap wastes should be tankered to the sewage treatment plant and discharged to an
unmixed unheated tank. Grease will rise to the surface-and form a crust. Solids such as peelings
and scraps will settle to the bottom. The water fraction will be drained to the sewage treatment
plant inlet works. When the sludge and grease layers build up to excessive levels, the sludge and

grease will be pumped out and taken to the landfill for disposal. The sludge/grease mixture should
be covered as quickly as possible. New by-laws including regulations will be required to be
enacted by the Municipality in order to properly control and regulate these activities.
A4.3 Landfill Life
Table A4.3-Landfill Volumes outlines the capacity of the site in cubic metres of total void space,
volumes of co, er material required, finally the void space available to accept waste.
To complete the final landform illustrated in Figure 4.1-Final Landform, a total insitu waste
volume of approximately 3.4 million cubic metres is available. This is equivalent to approximately
1.1 to 1.4 million tonnes for "uncompacted" waste (using a dozer to spread and compact) and 2.5
to 3.1 million tonnes for waste compacted using a large purpose built compactor. The difference
between compaction rates influences the life of the landfill. That is, the use of a purpose built
compactor instead of a dozer would increase the life of the landfill from approximately 10 years to
25 years.

Total    3,900,000    500,000       3,400,000
A4.4 Method of Landfilling
Prior to the commencement of filling with waste, the area will need to be progressively prepared as
follows:
*  intercept and divert upstream surface water catchments around the proposed filling area
* excavate soil gravels and rock to grades which allow the interception/collection of leachate
*  prepare the walls to provide stable perimeter batters
* place incoming refuse in compacted 3 metre lift thicknesses supplemented with the
provision of daily soil cover
*  shape and seal the completed landform to effectively shed rainwater
*  develop a vegetative cover over the completed landform to control erosion
The base of the quarry should be excavated in accordance with the grades shown on Figure 4.2-
Quarry Base Excavation.

The walls of the landfill area should be excavated to the profiles illustrated on Figure 4.3- Quarry
Wall Profiles. The method of excavation shall be such as to provide stable batters. Any loose
rock should be scaled down to avoid the possibility of falling rock spalls.
Where the total depth of excavation exceeds 9 metres and an appropriate 600 slope, benches
have been included to catch falling rock spalls and to improve the stability of the rock faces. The
width of the benches shall be 3 metres which will allow access by a small tracked machine to
remove accumulated debris.
The base of the landfill area should be cleaned down to the impermeable sandstone layer. All
waste delivered to the landfill should be spread by a dozer or purpose built compactor into layers
not exceeding 0.6m thickness and compacted continuously during spreading within an overall lift
thickness not exceeding 3m.
The quarry/landfill should be progressively excavated in the sequence shown on Figure 4.4-
Quarry Excavation Sequence such that the base of the landfill site is prepared in advance of the
filling operations.
A4.5 Placement of Waste
All waste delivered to the landfill should be spread by a dozer or purpose built compactor into
layers not exceeding 0.6m in thickness, and compacted continuously during spreading within an
overall lift thickness not exceeding 3m.
A4.6 Method of Rainfall Runoff Control
Rainfall runoff will be controlled by intercepting upstream runoff waters and diverting them around
the landfill area.
On site rainfall wiil be controlled by:
. preparing and filling the overall site in 10 stages such that rainfall falling on yet unfilled
areas will be shed directly off site without contacting waste
e each progressive staged filling area will be at the head or top of the overall landfill area
3 each progressive staged filled landform will be shaped to shed surface water
- intermediate and final soil cover will be used to shed surface water away from the waste fill
operational area
* each staged filling area will be progressively bunded as shown on Figure 4. 5- Stage 1
Filling Sequence.
A4.7 Sequence of Filling
The filling sequence should be such that the following criteria are satisfied:
* waste to be placed progressively from the top or "head" of the catchment towards the
eventual final outlet
*-  *  allow the progressive shedding of surface water as the landforms are built and evntuaily
merge
* allow the diversion of rainfall runoff around the various stages of filling
*                   .  allow a reasonably coordinated approach by the two key operations at the site - Quarrying
and landfilling

LANDFILL INVESTIGATION
FIG No
STAGE 1 FILLING SEQUENCE                    A4.5



Through an examination of the site and contour plans, a quarry excavation sequence has been
developed (Figure A4.4 - Quarry Excavation Sequence) which achieves the above aims.
Stage 1 will allow access to both road gravels and some intermediate cover material. Stage 2 will
require the removal of a substantial volume of clayey loam material which will be needed during
the landfill operation in Stage 1. The progressive mining and filling of Stages 1 through 4 leaves
the lower central area free as a drainage outlet. A central drain will be constructed to allow free
drainage of all the upper stages to the outlet drain which is the major drainage path for the site
draining a total catchment of some 312.5 ha in a north westerly direction to the Tuul River. As
each stage reaches its '"inal" shape it will be covered with the clayey loam material and shaped to
allow the shedding of surface water to the perimeter of the landfill area.
A4.8 Number of Lifts
Stage 1 will involve placing waste fill in 3 metre lifts from about EL 1315 to EL 1330 that is about 5
lifts in all. Initially the landfilling will commence from the north eastern end of the site. As the
landform is raised, it will be easier to develop an access road to the northern side of the site and
ramp down to the filling area. The timing of these internal roads cannot be predicted as it depends
upon quarrying activities, landfill development, temporary stockpile locations, and many other
factors. The landfill supervisor will be able to determine the correct timing for internal access road
relocations. The balance of the stages will commence at the sandstone base following quarrying
operations but at various stages it will be clearly easier to prepare access roads/tracks around the
perimeter of the site and access the raised fill areas from the elevated perimeter area.
A4.9 Final Landform and Rehabilitation of Site
The final landform contours are based on several assumptions:
.  the maximisation of the capacity of this landfill site is consistent with the surrounding
*                      topography
*  provision of final gradients of 6% minimum following final settlement
*  filling 1 m above the final predicted design levels to allow for settlement
The overall design philosophy of the final landform is to provide a well drained, domed landform
which will shed water and minimise leachate production. The shape is topographically consistent
with the surrounding landscape and once grassed will conform to the local rural setting as a
general pasture/grazing area.
The ultimate landform has not been finalised, however the proposed rolling/hilly topography is
compatible with the surrounding area.
Because of its location remote from the residential area of the city, the simplest end usage of the
site would be as a livestock grazing area consisting of open grassland. With the progressive re-
establishment of grasses over the completed landfill, the area could be used for cattle/sheep
grazing. This would require a final capping of 600mm thickness of inert clayey soil with the upper
150mm of the capping consisting of topsoil.
Restrictions on future development of the waste filled area are largely economic as the inherent
problems of settlement, bearing capacity, and corrosion can be overcome technically, but at
significant extra cost above conventional devolopment costs. Because of the very long life of this
proposed landfill, there is no necessity to place restrictions on its final development apart from
accurately recording its progressive actual areal axtte,t and depth.
There are legal implications regarding the quarry operation aspect of the landfill. The landfill
operation relies on the appropriate preparation of the base by the quarry operator. If the quarry
operation is undertaken by a quarry contractor, then a legal contract should ensure the operation
of the quarry in accordance with the staged preparation for the landfill as outlined in this EIA.

A5. Existing Environment
A5.1 Soils and Geology
The proposed landfill site is located in undulating country between the relatively flat lowland below
EL 1230 to the north west and the relatively steep hill region above EL 1460 to the south east.
Within a radius of about 2km the ground surface level varies from less than EL 1230 to in excess
of EL 1420. The highest point on the subject site is at EL 1371 with the major portion being lower
than EL 1320. The site is gently undulating to steep and is roughly rectangular in shape with
approximate dimensions of 1000m (north east-south west) by 600m (north west-south east). The
site falls generally from the north east to the south west at grades of between 3% to 20% but over
the majority of the site the gradients are between 4% and 8%. Part of the site has been disturbed
with the excavation of the loose weathered sandstone rock, presumably as a roadbase material.
The geological description of the site is summarised as Cainozoic era, Quaternary period, fan,
talus, valley deposit, clay sand, and pebble to boulder (sub-rounded to sub-angular). The base
rock is sandstone and. is considered impervious except where faults and crevices may exist
although this is considered highly unlikely (Geological Institute, Ulaanbaatar). Test drilling over the site
by the Geotechnical Institute confirms a relatively uniform thickness of topsoil, sandy gravels, and
sand/loam gravels at an average of 4.5m overlaying the base sandstone. Details are shown in
Appendix IlIl Geotechnical Test Results.
The proposed use of the overlaying gravels, loams, sands and rock for road and general
construction materials will need further detailed testing to determine the extent and relevant
properties of each of the different materials. The existence of nearby quarries for roadworks and
construction materials is however a good indication that the soil and rock materials on the
proposed site are suitable for such purposes.
A5.2 Climate
The study area is characterised by the following:
Average annual temperature:    -3.50C varying from -24.60C in January to 16.60C in July.
Average annual rainfall    :    240 mm. 80% falls from June to August
Average annual humidity   :   69%
Average wind speed  :          2.3 metre per second from the south-east in winter and from
the north in summer. Winds of 10-15 metres per second and
higher occur about 15 days per year.
Average Soil Temperature :     -290 in January and 200 in July
Snow Cover               :     Stable cover from November to April Average thickness
13.5cm
A5.3 Flora
For the purpose of this environmental assessment the Moringiin Davaa site is classified as a
section of the Dahuirian-Mongolian region of flora and topographic division, on a forest-steppe
16



region of Mongolia. From a site inspection on 9th September, 1996, the following plants were
identified on the site:
  Vegetation covering about 10% of the area including salsola pestifer, rutifolia, macrocephala,
semlly-Dragon head and also little leaf peashrubs.
.  Ravine slopes - sparse areas of dracunculus, Altaia Heteropappus, chamaerhodos
*  On the southern hill - peashrub, needle grass, scabrous cleistogenes and hardy sedge,
cinquefoil, prostrate summer cypress, undulate rhubarb.
*  On the top of the hill - hardy sedge, needle grass, silver cinquefoil, Altaian heteropappus,
fringed sagebrush, about 10% of this area includes thin hairy sandwort, wormwood, Altaian
chamaerhodos and thyme.
*  North hill. 10-15% of this area is covered with little leaf and warawleaf Peashrubs. Also
racemose blue grass, swampy wormwood, thyme, spiny Russian thistle, daguirian asparagus,
smelly Dragon-head.
*  Middle section of north hill - plant covering 10% mostly little leaf peashrub, needle grass,
fringed sagebrush, foot shaped sedge, heteropappus, prostrate summer cypress, large bract
iris, swampy wormwood and thin hairy sand wort.
*  Top side of north hill - mostly Lenen Fescue, sedge, thin hairy sand wort, fringed sage brush,
Altaian Heteropappus and chamaerhodos, occasional waraleaf peashrub.
*  Top of north hill - Plant covering 5% consisting of occasional warawleaf peashrub, occasional
thin hairy sand wort, Lenen Fescue, fringed sagebrush, Altaian chamaerhodos, Lenen Fescue.
A5.4 Fauna
Moringiin Davaa is included in a zone where five types of mammals, fourteen types of birds and
thirty three types from six families of insects are found. These are listed hereunder:

A5.5 Hydrogeology
According to the geotechnical investigation no groundwater exists at the site down to six metres
(refer Appendix IlIl - Geotechnical Test Results ). The nearest ground water was located
approximately 1.5 km downstream from the site (in a south-westerly direction) at an existing
borehole. The Tuul river is approximately 3.5 kilometres from the site in the direction of the runoff
from the site towards the river.
A5.6 Water Quality
Water quality testing has been conducted near the proposed landfill site and at sites downstream
of the existing sites of Dari Ekh as shown on Fig A2.1 General Locality Plan and Fig A3.1
17



Locality Plan. The test results are presented in Appendix 5 Water Quality Results. In
summary none of the water samples are suitable for drinking water in accordance with both
Mongolian and World Health Organisation standards. The samples taken from the locations
downstream of the existing landfill sites of Dari Ekh and Ulaan Chuluut are contaminated with
heavy metals Lead, Mercury, and Cadmium and are very dangerous for human consumption.
The sample from near Moringiin Davaa is uncontaminated however Ammonium and Nitrite
compound levels are above acceptable levels.
A5.7 Noise and Air Quality
Existing noise levels and air quality are typical of a semi-rural environment.
A5.8 Archaeology and Cultural History
No features of archaeological or cultural history significance were located at the proposed site.
A5.9 Land Use
Grazing is the main agricultural activity. Quarrying activities are being undertaken within a 0.5
kilometre radius south west of the site. The Biocomplex Company is situated approximately two
kilometres from the site to the north and a military barracks is situated approximately 2.5
kilometres to the north west. Also there are electric power transmission lines running from north
east to south west across a section of the site and from north west to south east within one
kilometre of the site.
A5.10 Visual Amenity
The landscape of the area is predominantly rural. Existing quarrying activities are visible from the
main road. Only a small part of the proposed landfill site is visible in a north easterly direction
from the main road.
A5.11 Existing Traffic Situation
The Ulaanbaatar - Altanbulag Road, although being one of the major arterial roads connecting
Ulaanbaatar with the Central Aimag, it is a relatively lightly trafficked roadway which provides
access for the Biocomplex Company and the adjoining residential area, the Military
Barracks(although this use is reducing) and to the chicken 'factory' at Altanbulag. It also provides
access for other through traffic to and from the Central Aimag.
Traffic flow information has been obtained from the Traffic department, Ministry of Infrastructure.
The information provided shows that this road was designed for 1000 to 3000 vehicles per day.
The predicted increase in the level of traffic due to the landfill/quarry use is about 100 vehicles per
day when all traffic has been diverted from the existing landfill sites to the proposed site (10%
increase max.).
The majority of vehicles already using this road are heavy vehicles associated with quarrying,
industrial and agricultural activities, therefore the additional traffic will be consistent with current
usage. No upgrading works of this road is proposed.

A6. Site Hydrogeology
A6.1 Surface Drainage
The site is located within a catchment area as illustrated in Figure A6.1 - Catchment Areas.
There are no external catchments flowing through the proposed site.  The major external
catchment into which the site drains adjoins the site at its south east. This catchment is
approximately 312.5 hectares in area and it runs off into the lowland area adjacent to the Tuul
River.
The intersection of the site drainage with the above-mentioned main adjoining catchment is
immediately to the south west of the site. During the geotechnical investigation, drilling at this
location indicated no ground water to a depth of six metres below surface level.
Diversion of rainfall runoff around the landfill site can be achieved with the construction of relatively
minor perimeter earthworks diversion drainage.
A6.2 Subsurface Seepage
Essentially, the undeveloped site is underlain by variable depth of sandy gravels and sand/loam
gravels which become weathered sandstone with depth and finally sandstone bedrock.
Five boreholes were drilled between the seventh and the eleventh of August, 1996 at the
locations shown on Figure A6.2 - Locations of Boreholes to depths of 4.2 metres to 6 metres.
Representative samples of the overburden were taken and tested in the Geotechnical Institute
Laboratory for classification, testing (plastic properties) and infiltration testing (refer Appendix 3 -
Geotechnical Testing).

A7. Solid Waste Composition and Recycling Strategies
A7.1 Solid Waste Composition
A detailed audit of the waste stream has not been undertaken. Typical waste stream data has
been obtained from the Ministry of Nature and Environment and is presented in Table A7.1 - Solid
Waste Stream Composition.
A7.2 Recycling Strategies
It is expected that the waste volumes generated in Ulaanbaatar city will grow in the near future.
With this growth there will be an increased recognition for the need of the preservation of natural
resources and the increasing costs of waste disposal.
It is generally accepted that controlled, engineered sanitary landfills will continue to be the most
suitable and economic disposal method for the foreseeable future. However, the identification of
suitable sites within economic travelling distance from the city area will become more difficult to
find.
In order to reduce waste volumes it is generally accepted that the recycling of various waste
products is essential. The Ministry of Nature and Environment has a stated policy of reducing the
volume of the city waste by 50% by year 2000.
To date recycling activities have been entrepreneur based with little or no Government
involvement. They have concentrated on those products for which there exists a ready market
either locally or nearby (eg. Beijing). The emphasis has been on bones, metals, paper and
cardboard, and glass. Other specific items such as batteries are also part of the solid waste
recycling market. Much of this recyclable material is sorted and collected by scavengers at
apartment waste collection points at the bottom of garbage chutes. The amount of waste recycled
from apartments in this manner is not insignificant and is estimated to be around 50% of
apartment waste where formal collection areas are provided. There are also a number of small
businesses which specialise in collecting, receiving, and selling to larger recycling/reprocessing
companies either locally or in Beijing such products as batteries, brass, aluminium, and other
products.
Highly mechanised and automated solid waste sorting facilities have been implemented in several
countries including Germany and The United States. These facilities, generally termed Materials
Recycling Facilities (MRF), should only be seriously considered after extensive research has been
undertaken into all relevant aspects. The facilities are high initial and high operating cost items
and require many specific inputs such as suitable siting and infrastructure, relevant commercial
and technical skills, capacity to fulfil the marketing requirements and so on.
Some preliminary estimates of costs associated with MRFs, based upon a capacity to process
20,000 tonnes of product per year (80 tonnes/day or approximately 15% of incoming solid waste)
are:
1. Construction costs - $15,000 to $46,000 per tonne of daily capacity (Ref. 3). Assume $26,250
for this exercise. This with interest on risk capital at a conservative rate of 15% p. a. equates
to $22/tonne of recycled product processed.
2. Operation and maintenance costs are reported to be (Ref. 3) between $28 and $34 /tonne.
Therefore the total cost could be as high as $62/tonne or $1.3m. This does not include and costs
associated with land acquisition and rates and taxes. A cost to operate such a facility would be of
the order of $1.5m. Such an investment requires a very cautionary approach even in areas with
much more evolved recycling infrastructure than Mongolia and for that reason, they are not
considered an option in Ulaan-baatar's solid waste strategy now or in the near future.

One of the major components of Ger area solid waste is the ash generated from the burning of
coal and timber during the winter months. The proportion of this ash is as high as 60% of the Ger
area waste generated over the winter months and the disposal of the ash is one of the major
problems faced by these residents.
The recycling of this ash waste for use in the manufacture of products such as  lightweight
masonry concrete building blocks or fuel briquettes has been investigated on previous occasions
and some research has also been done in conjunction with this project. A local concrete building
block company was approached in relation to the use of this ash waste for building blocks and
fuel briquette manufacture. This company had previously used coal ash waste from power
stations in the manufacture of light weight cellular concrete blocks however this source of ash
supply was discontinued because the ash quality was variable in terms of moisture and unburnt
coal. Laboratory and pilot plant testing of the Ger area ash waste has been arranged and the
preliminary results indicate that the ash is very suitable for use in light weight masonry block
manufacture. The ash would replace about 20% of the silica sand currently used.
This option for ash recycling therefore appears to show the greatest promise when compared with
alternatives such as disposal by burial in pits or the continuation of the present system whereby
most of the ash waste is disposed indiscriminately in nearby gullies and ravines. If this building
block and fuel briquette recycling option proves to be technically viable, the Municipality should
then take the initiative by calling tenders for private companies to collect the ash waste from
specified collection points within the Ger areas and transport it to their depot/factory. A contract
would then be prepared on the basis of a payment (if any) per cubic metre collected. Some
arrangements could be made to ensure that the consistency and volumes of ash placed in the
collection containers is as generally agreed in the contract. Municipal employees such as Hooroo
leaders could be involved in this matter.
Other ways in which the Municipality could actively promote recycling activities are:
- by issuing licenses to companies or persons to purchase, receive, store and sell recyclable
waste materials. To encourage such enterprises, suitable land could be made available
with attractive lease arrangements such as a 5 year term renewable subject to satisfactory
operations of the business (in accordance with specific conditions set out in the lease
agreement). In this manner the Municipality could better encourage, control, and regulate
recycling operations at the Ger area level.
*  With the construction of transfer stations the Municipality could contract to companies or
individuals the rights to sort, collect and remove from the transfer station certain recyclable
materials in accordance with specific conditions such as the number of employees allowed
on the site, the hours to be worked , the areas to work in, the materials to be scavenged,
and the methods of operation.
The goal of a 50% reduction of the waste stream volume cannot be achieved under the present
collection and disposal arrangements.  Strategies such as the above-mentioned recycling
recommendations will be necessary to achieve the major reductions in the solid waste volumes
currently being disposed at the landfills
A7.3 Cover Supply
A7.3.1 Intermediate /Daily Cover
Each day's waste should be covered with soil following compaction of the waste.
Tha- on site loamy soils are suitable as a cover during dry and wet weather, although Swrd
gravelly soil made need to be added in heavy rain conditions for trafficability.
A 7.3.2 Final Cover
The final cover areas having a final gradient of 6% minimum should consist of clayey materials.
The depth of final cover should not exceed 600mm.
21



A 7.3.3 Availability
Based on the quarry/landfill development and preparation outlined in Figures A4.1 and A4.2 , the
volumes of topsoil and loam and clayey materials for intermediate and final cover construction are
as summarised in Table A7.3
Topsoil is considered to consist of any soil with a relatively high organic content or which will
become contaminated with grass or other organic matter while being cleared from the site. The
topsoil lay3r across the site varies from nothing where erosion has exposed the weathered
sandstones and gravels to about 700mm in thickness. Careful removal of vegetative matter from
operational areas prior to topsoil removal would halve the volume of 'topsoil' to about 25,000 m3.
Loam/clay soils required for intermediate and final cover purposes would be about 200,000 m33.
When compared to the volume of cover materials available(Table A7.3 below) there is sufficient
material available on site to create the final landform (Figure A4.1).
Table A7.3 - Cover Materials Available
Cover Material Description  Volume Available
Topsoil                   25,000
Sandy Gravels             1,000,000
Loam sandy gravels        150,000

A8. Surface Water Management
A8.1 Introduction
The surrounding area is undulating ccuntryside with grades varying from 4 to 8% generally with
some steeper areas towards the hill tops. The proposed site is well drained and there are no
external catchments running through the site.
One external catchment drains the site, as follows:
Catchment E located to the east of the site. The catchment is some 312.5 Ha in area and
3.80 km in length.
(Refer to Figure A6.1 for catchment and topography details)
Table A8. 1 - External Catchment Characteristics
Area (ha)  Slope(m/km)   Length of Catch. (m)   Time of Conc. (min.)
312.5     46.05          3800                  57.6874
Table A8.2 External Catchment Flows for Q2,Q5,Qlo,and Q100 Events
Recurrence Interval    2     5        10      100
Rainfall Intensity   22      29      40       65
Coefficient of Runoff   0.48    0.57    0.6   0.72
Flow (m3/s)          9.174   14.36   20.85   40.658
To carry the 100 year flow generated by catchment E a trapezoidal channel 2.0m deep, 3.Om wide
at the base with side slopes 1 in 4 will carry the required 40.65 m3/s. This creek bed level varies
from EL 1275 at the eastern end of the landfill site to EL 1260 at the western end of the site. To
ensure no contamination of this rainfall runoff water, the extent of excavation in the landfill should
be limited to EL 1280 at the south east corner of the landfill and EL 1265 at the north west corner.
The landfill site catchment area is 60 hectares and 800 metres in length.  The time of
concentration is 11.7 minutes, intensity is 90mm/hr, coefficient of runoff is 0.72, and the 100 year
flow is 10.8 m3/s.  This flow must be diverted around the perimeter of the landfill site
(approximately 50% on each side). The 5.4m3/s flow can be carried in trapezoidal channel 0.6m
deep, 2.Om wide at the base with side slopes of 1 -in 4.

*                A9. Leachate Control
A9.1 Leachate Generation and Control
Leachate is the liquid by-product of microbial activity within a solid waste landfill together with
dissolved and suspended solid matter eluted by both groundwater and surface water percolating
through the landfill mass. Sanitary landfills located in relatively arid areas such as Ulaanbaatar
have minimal potential for leachate generation and therefore an impermeable lining of the landfill
area with clay or other material is considered unnecessary .
Due to the low levels of precipitation, a leachate drainage pipe network under the refuse is not
needed. The leachate may be collected with the provision of an earth bund/dyke at the toe of the
site and a gravel trench with a leachate interception pipe. Treatment of the collected leachate by a
storage/evaporation pond to achieve anaerobic decomposition and aerobic stabilisation will be
sufficient. If at any time the lagoon storage volume is insufficient, the leachate may be tankered
away to the sewage treatment plant or recirculated back to the landfill. Discharge of the treated
leachate to the nearby surface water runoff system would only be acceptable if the leachate was
treated or diluted to such a level that it would meet the water quality standards of the receiving
waters.
A9.2 Leachate Management Strategy
The basics of the management strategy are:
  elirminate lateral movement of the leachate by grading the base of the quarry/landfill to a
central area
-  reducing the volume of leachate generated by using filling, shaping, compaction, and
covering procedures which severely restrict direct rainfall entry
*  reducing the volume of leachate generated by intercepting and by-passing all upstream
surface water around the fill area in surface drainage channels
*  intercept all leachate at the toe of the landfill area and treat in a storage /evaporation pond
of approximate dimensions 30m by 20m by 1.5m deep (with clay lining or plastic
membrane lining)
*  tankering any treated leachate excess to storage/evaporation pond capacity to the sewage
treatment plant or recirculating to the grassed areas over the completed areas of the
landfill for removal by direct evapo-transpiration.
A Typical layout of a leachate storage/evaporation pond is shown on the attached Figure A9.1.

AIO. Mitigation of Potential Air Pollution from Landfill Gas
A10.1 Landfill Gas
Gases found in landfills are composed mainly of carbon dioxide and methane but can include
minor amounts of ammonia, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, hydrogen sulphide, nitrogen and oxygen
as well as many other trace constituents.
Aerobic decomposition continues to occur until the oxygen in the air initially present in the
compacted wastes is depleted. Thereafter decomposition will proceed anaerobically producing
mainly methane.
The gas production rate and composition is a function of many parameters such as land fill
moisture, content, age, and biodegradability.
Biological activity is directly responsible for methane generation from landfilled organic wastes.
The biological decomposition phase takes place in three stages that are not distinctly separated.
The presence or absence of oxygen is the principal stage-determining factor. When solid waste is
initially deposited, oxygen is trapped in the fill materials by the landfilling operation. While this
oxygen is available, organic wastes are decomposed into C02 , water, residual organics and heat
by aerobic micro-organisms. Aerobic decomposition occurs relatively quickly. C02 content can
reach 90%. Some carbon dioxide dissolves into any available water, resulting in decreased pH
levels, while the balance remains in the gaseous phase.
The oxygen consumed by aerobic micro-organisms is not generally replaced, due to the presence
of a low permeability soil cover. This results in a gradual decrease in the aerobic micro-organisms
population and a corresponding increase in the facultative micro-organism population which are
tolerant to oxygen but do not depend on it. The characteristic products of this second stage
biological decay are carbon dioxide and partially degraded organics, including organic acids which
cause a further reduction in pH levels.
As all of the available oxygen is consumed, the anaerobic methane forming micro-organisms
become dominant. The methane forming bacteria are relatively slow, producing water and
methane with very little production of heat. This group of micro-organisms efficiently decomposes
organic matter, including organic acids, into gaseous end products, mostly methane.  The
reduction of organic acid content and the lower production of carbon dioxide promotes an increase
in the leachate pH to near neutral values.
As it is not anticipated that there will be any large scale tree regeneration program (only grass and
small shrubs) associated with the final rehabilitation of the site, the passive release of landfill gas
through a 600mm thick soil cover will be acceptable.
A10.2 Passive Release of Gas
As mentioned above a minimal thickness of 600mm soil cover will allow grass and small shrubs to
grow over the rehabilitated landfill site.
Upon the completion of a specific area of the landfill, rock filled, wire mesh wrapped, vertical wells
of about one metre diameter spaced about 0.'1 ha can be installed to allow passive release of any
landfill gases.
A10.3 Global Warming and Greenhouse Effect
The biodegradation of organic matter within a landfill produces mainly methane and carbon dioxide
gases, both of which are 'greenhouse' gases in that they let the warming rays of the sun penetrate
the earth's atmosphere and thence tend to restrain that warmth from passing back into space.
25



However, the organic mater which is concentrated in landfills will biodegrade in any case, likely at
a faster rate under aerobic conditions (in air) than under the anaerobic conditions (without air) that
exists within a landfill once it is placed, compacted and sealed.
The volume of methane and carbon dioxide that is produced in landfills is a fraction of one per
cent when compared to that produced by volcanoes, deep sea geysers, fossil fuel burning, forest
burning, industry, cattle, warming of the northern hemisphere tundra and so on.
The net effect of the production of methane gas and carbon dioxide gas in landfills with respect to
the environment is negligible.
If the composition of the solid waste changes such that the increased generation of such landfill
gases becomes an environmental problem, then flaring of the gas with the installation of gas vents
can be achieved with the drilling of boreholes and installation of perforated pipes within gravel
packing in specific areas of the landfill upon their completion.

All. Impact and Mitigation of Increased Traffic Generation
*  A11.1Road Network
The Ulaanbaatar - Altanbulag Road is an arterial road that services the areas south-west of
Ulaanbaatar and it forms part of the major access route for the proposed landfill site. The road is
sealed with two lanes about 3.5 metres in width and gravel shoulders exist but are very narrow in
sections. The existing road between Nisekh and Moringiin Davaa will need to be widened to
accommodate the safe passage of two heavy vehicles passing in opposite directions. This
widening could be in the form of providing formal gravel shoulders of sufficiently high standard to
support the occasional use by heavy traffic. The anticipated traffic increase due to the
quarry/landfill operation is about 100 vehicles/day. The major impact of these extra vehicles will
be dust and noise especially in the residential areas of Nisekh and the Bio-complex. There is a
section of the road through the Bio-complex area that requires re-sealing prior to the operation of
the extra traffic to the landfill site in order to reduce the anticipated dust generation. The noise
generated by the extra traffic will be at the same level as the existing traffic and therefore no
mitigating action is required.
A11.2 Summary
The major traffic impacts of this proposal are concerned with dust generation and safety to all road
users due to the increased level of heavy traffic. The following works would be required:
*  Seal existing sections of road where seal has been lost especially in the Bio-complex
area
( Construct gravel shoulders of sufficient width and strength for the occasional use of
heavy vehicles.
27



A12. Other Impacts
A12.1 Noise
Noise levels are expected to increase marginally above those presently experienced at the nearby
sand/loam quarry currenty operating.  Equipment associated with the new quarry/landfill will
generate some extra noise with the use of heavy plant such as bulldozers, and the larger
compactor transfer trucks.
A12.2 Visual Amenity
The proposed site is well located from a visual perspective. Due to the local topography the site is
visible only from a limited number of locations. The proposed quarry/landfill will be less visually
intrusive than the existing quarry and landfill developments in the area. The final landfill shape
will be topographically consistent with the surrounding countryside and once grassed will conform
to the local rural setting.
A12.3 Water Quality
The potential impact of the landfill operation on water quality in the adjoining watercourse and
ultimately the Tuul River System is negligible. The low rainfall and flow through the landfill mass
will result in very little leachate generation. Any leachate that is generated will be intercepted via a
gravel trench/drain and diverted to the storage/evaporation pond. The sizing of this pond will be
such as to accept the runoff generated from the landfill catchment during a ten year return storm.
This is considered conservative as the actual leachate generation will be at a considerably lower
rate than this calculated runoff. The storage/evaporation pond will be sealed with plastic liner to
prevent any infiltration into the surrounding soil and if there is any possibility of the pond capacity
being insufficient then a recirculation pumping system will automatically pump the leachate back to
the landfill for direct evapo-transpiration on grassed areas.
A12.4 Dust and Odour
There are no residences within close proximity of the landfill. The nearest habitation is the military
barracks which is over two kilometres direct distance from the landfill site.
The predominant wind direction for the area is from the north west. Therefore any possible dust
and odour nuisance will not be detected in that area.
Odours will be minimised by ensuring that only the smallest practicable working face is used (to
minimise the volume of exposed refuse), and that the site is well profiled to avoid water ponding.
Refuse will be covered daily in accordance with good practice, to further lessen odour generation
potential.
Dust would be controlled by regular watering of roads, stockpiles and other disturbed areas.
Progressive revegetation of the refuse mound batters will reduce the dust export from the site.

A13. Risk Assessment
A13.1 Construction
The construction phase for the proposed Moringiin Davaa landfill is the quarrying operation that
will be undertaken prior to and during the landfill operation. Potential hazards during construction
are limited to those typical of any earthworks construction site. The potential environmental
impacts during the construction phase are erosion of soil and dust emissions.
A13.2 Operation
A number of risks exist within the operation of the landfill to personnel and to the environment. The
risks to personnel are covered by the normal safe practices for earthmoving works with the
additional precautions when covering the specialist areas for:
* asbestos
* medical 'sharps'
In these instances, specialist protective clothing should be worn. Also a vermin and insect and
disease vector proof enclosure is required for staff amenities for meals, etc.
The risks to staff and the environment include:
i  rodents, vermin, flies, birds, etc.
*  odour emissions
_                    .  noise
*  fire at the landfill face either accidental or mischievous
*  leachate being unusually contaminated and migrating
*  drift of sprays used to control disease vectors
*  wind blown debris
*  vehicle collisions and other accidents
*  gas control
The EMP addresses the main issues in detail. Measures to minimise the other risks are as
follows:
Fire: Surface fires may be sprayed using water from the leachate evaporation pond if there is
sufficient water available. If there is insufficient leachate available, The fire may be 'suffocated'
by covering it with soil, or if it is too large to fight, it should be left to burn itself out. A subsurface
fire within the refuse mound will require excavation to expose the combustion and then treat as a
surface fire.
Leachate Contamination and Migration: As described in the report, the possibility of leachate
formation is very small. Signs prohibiting the disposal of toxic wastes will be erected at the landfill
and at the transfer stations. Any deposition could lead to a problem when combined with storm
water runoff or flooding. Leachate is a risk, but does not represent a hazard unless the leachate
can migrate from the landfill mound. Prior to leachate producing an environmental hazard, it must
29



exit the mound either via surface springs or by entering the ground water system. The leachate, if
produced will not infiltrate the sandstone bedrock and the leachate interception and treatment
proposed will prevent any groundwater contamination.

A14. Environmental Management Plan
Introduction
The purpose of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is to outline the methods to be used
and necessary actions for the proposed Moringiin Davaa landfill to comply with current and
potential future environmental regulations.
The EMP addresses the various stages of landfill development including the construction,
operation and decommissioning and rehabilitation. It can be read in isolation from the EIA and it
forms part of the Operations Manual which should be prepared prior to the commencement of the
landfill operations.
A14.1 Staffing and Equipment
The landfill gatekeeper will be responsible for checking all loads at the landfill. There will also be a
requirement for 2 gatekeepers at each of the transfer stations.
The General staffing and responsibilities will be:
*  dozer operator or
*  compactor operator
  gatekeepers (at landfill and at transfer stations)
*  water cart operator/general hand
  recycling/scavenging staff
*  Site Foreman, responsible for all landfill operations on a daily basis, to implement the EMP
and supervise daily operations
*  Manager - Waste Management Section, senior officer to whom the site supervisor reports.
-  Environmental Health Officer, Municipality responsible for quality assurance of all
operations including EMP overview.
Facilities on the site will include a gatehouse and a compound for the storage of equipment and
facilities including vehicles and fuel.
14.2 Training and Reporting procedures
The Site Manager will provide a monthly report to the Manager, Waste Management on all aspects
of the EMP, including complaints and monitoring results. A formalised structure and training
program should be developed whereby staff will be trained to undertake the Site Foreman's and
the Manager's roles in their absence. The training would extend to all landfill operating staff to
ensure their understanding of the EMP requirements and how the EMP affects their daily
operations. A complaints register would be established at the landfill site to ensure that landfill
users have an opportunity to lodge their complaints.
The complaints register serves two purposes:
1. It identifies problems unseen cr .eg!e'ted by the landfill staff and will ensure the problem is
recognised and necessary action taken.
2. It enables the public to voice their concerns and to have them fully documented.
The complaints register applies to many aspects addressed in the EMP, such as noise,
odour, dust, mud, visual impacts, litter, water quality and so on.
31



A14.3 Reception of Waste at the Landfill
The following data is to be obtained from all vehicles entering the site carrying waste:
* time and date
*                     .  vehicle registration details
. name
* type of waste
The gatekeeper will observe the type of waste entering the landfill site. If the refuse contains
unacceptable material, the gatekeeper will require the unacceptable material to be removed from
the load for dumping elsewhere, or reject the entire load and have the vehicle move off site.
The following information should be recorded following the receipt of any special wastes:
. quantity
* nature of waste
* date of receipt
. waste disposal site (location and level/lift to be noted on the base plan)
A14.4 Waste Characteristics
The following waste types will be accepted at the landfill:
- domestic solid waste as collected by the Municipality or contractor's vehicles on a
regular basis
_                     .  acceptable commercial and industrial waste collected by contractors
* inert construction and demolition waste eg. concrete, timber, masonry
shredded vehicle tyres
The wastes that may be accepted on site but should be addressed separately include:
. asbestos
sharps' from hospitals, veterinary, and research or other places
dead animals
dry sewage sludge
l low level, radioactive waste, as determined by the approval conditions of the landfill
Items unacceptable to the landfill will include:
* dangerous goods such as explosives
  high level radioactive wastes
*  hazardous wastes such as toxic chemicals
*  large volumes of liquid waste
*  toxic substances such as acids
*  hot loads at greater than 50°C
32



A14.5 Compaction
Poorly compacted wastes create many problems including more litter, odour. more leachate,
damage to vehicles because of poorly compacted internal roads, and unnecessary consumption of
valuable space.
To achieve optimum compaction, the following procedures should be adhered to:
* each layer of refuse must be less than 0.6 m thick. If the layers are thicker, the density will
not increase with additional passes
* each layer of refuse should receive a minimum of three passes of a dozer; for best results
five passes are required.
* the width of the working face should be kept to a minimum, but this will depend on how
many vehicles are at the landfill
* each lift should be between 2-3 metres in height
* all refuse should be tipped at the bottom of the face and be pushed up
If a tracked bulldozer is used to compact the waste, the tipping face should be kept to slope of 1 in
3. This high slope will help the tracks break up and cut the waste as the dozer climbs up the face.
If a compactor is used to compact the waste, the tipping face should be kept relatively flat at 1 in 8
or 1 in 10. The compactor does not need the steep slope to break up and cut the waste. The
much heavier weight of the compactor is best at compacting waste if the face is at a fairly flat
grade.
A14.6 Cover
After refuse has been compacted it should be covered daily to minimise odours and the ingress of
water into waste, to contain litter and to reduce the risks of fire and food sources for pests and
vermin.
There are many materials suitable for cover material, including:
* material excavated from the site
* excavation material from building sites
* crushed and broken concrete from building demolition
If the material is to be used for final cover, it must provide a stable, impermeable, permanent,
barrier to water, odour, pests, and vermin, and not be easily eroded. The best material is a sandy
clay, with some gravel to provide reasonable trafficability when wet. The daily cover on the face
should be 150-200 mm thick and must be spread only after the face has been well compacted.
On the outside batter and face of each landfill section, the cover must be carefully chosen and
placed. The final cover layer must keep the waste in, water out and allow plants to grow..
A14.7 Vegetation
On completion of the final cover for each lift, the surface should be adequately prepared by placing
top sAil Similar vegetation to the existing landfill site should be planted. It is critical that a!'
exposed batters are revegetated progressively upon completion of earthworks, as the vegetation:
* stabilises the batters against erosion
. softens the general appearance of the operation
33



A14.8 Signs
Adequate signs need to be in place to inform who has access to the site, where key locations are,
and the fundamental rules of the operation.
A sign at the entrance to the landfill should include:
*  name of the Municipality
*  name of the landfill
*  name of the contractor operating the landfill, if not the Municipality
*  who does/who does not have access to the landfill
*  hours of operation
*  emergency contact phone number
*  directions to tipping face
*  wastes that are accepted
*  materials that are not accepted
*  speed limit (usually 1Okph)
A sign near the tipping face should include:
*  directions on where to tip
.  instructions to follow operators directions
A sign near the entrance to the transfer stations should include:
* directions on where to deposit waste
* recyclables collected
On the landfill and access roads temporary signs must clearly mark the roads, direct vehicles and
indicate tipping locations.
A14.9 Security Gates and Fencing
A security fence, 1.8m high will be installed around the site. This fence should be checked weekly
for vandalism.
Inspections by the litter patrol will be necessary during windy weather. The litter patrol will advise
the Site Foreman of any fence damage.
A14.10 Dust Control
Dust control is achieved by spraying water on access roads, open dirt areas and stockpiles to
reduce the amount of dust emitted. Dust control is especially needed when dry and windy
*               conditions prevail.
34



The runoff collection pond will provide the primary source of water for dust suppression.
Otherwise water availability will be difficult, however as there are no residents or other buildings in
the general area, dust control will not be a major problem in the near future.
A14.11 Mud Control
Mud adhering to vehicles will be removed in a wheel wash prior to vehicles leaving the site. A
wheel wash consists of a shallow basin which removes the dirt from the tyres. The basin can be
made of concrete and can be profiled to enable a small wheeled machine with a front blade to
clean out the mud.
Al 4.12 Pest Control
It is anticipated that pests such as insects, rodents and other vermin will be effectively controlled
by compaction and covering techniques which will be used on the site. By limiting the exposed
working area through compaction and daily coverage of wastes, the availability of food and
protection for birds and rodents is severely restricted.
Birds are commonly a major pest problem at all landfills. If bird numbers are a problem, the Site
Foreman should arrange for pest control spraying. Similarly, if vermin numbers increase, a baiting
will be instituted.
Al 4.13 Litter Control
Litter control is to ensure that the sit e is generally clean and tidy. A moveable litter fence 1.8 m
high should be placed immediately adjacent to the landfill face. The length of the fence depends
on the length of the tipping face but should be long enough to encourage any changes in wind
direction.
The boundary fence is to keep trespassers out but it also helps to keep litter within the site. Any
litter found outside the site should be removed.
0               AA14.14 Fire Control
There should be no open fires deliberately started on the site. In the event of a fire, water from
the leachate storage lagoon can be used in conjunction with a tanker truck.
A14.15 Odour Control
Odour can occur from four main sources
landfill gas
* putrescent waste
* the working face particularly during wet weather
* impounded leachate ponds
Landfill gas is addressed in Al 4.16 below. Large volumes of putrescent waste will not be allowed
on the site unless appropriate controls have been instituted at the waste generation source. This
would include spray systems and more frequent collection of waste.
The working face odours can only be limited by minimising the area of exposed refuse, and
covering as quickly as practicable.
Leachate ponding should be avoided by correct profiling Af Jthe site and other leachate
containment systems.
Al 4.16 Gas Control
The details of gas formation and generation are presented in Section A10 of the EIA. It is not
anticipated that there will be any significant gas formation and generation based on the
composition of the solid as detailed in Table 7.1 Solid Waste Composition. If there is sufficient
35



gas generation then passive release can be achieved with rock-filled vertical wells about 1 metre
dia. constructed in specific areas of the landfill.
Al 4.17 Stormwater control
Monitoring of the stormwater quality within the site above and below the working area should be
undertaken in association with the monitoring of the surface and ground water downstream of the
site. Parameters analysed should include: electrical conductivity, pH, temperature, total dissolved
solids, suspended solids, turbidity, nitrogen, bicarbonate, chemical oxygen demand, standard
oxygen demand, standard water analysis, iron, total, zinc, chromium, lead, mercury, cadmium, and
copper.
Internal runoff contamination from cover stockpiles and disturbed areas can be minimised by
progressive revegetation of completed areas. The stability of local diversion channels should also
be checked on a regular basis and maintained to prevent contamination of runoff.
A14.18 Leachate Control
The principal means of minimising leachate formation by good site management techniques
include:
  Good compaction and covering of wastes which acts to limit infiltration into the landfill
*  grading of the site (particularly exposed areas) to not less than 6% which helps runoff
from the site and limits infiltration
*  The filling sequence will be from  "upstream  " to "downstream", intercepting and
diverting clean water around progressively completed waste areas.
Leachate quantities will be monitored at the storage/evaporation pond and tested regularly to
assess its quality. This testing is necessary to determine if the liquid is suitable for irrigation.
Al 4.19 Post Management Plan
The Post Management Plan has been incorporated into each section of the EMP so it is a
progressive process.
The ultimate land form and use of the site has not been finalised, however the proposed rolling hill
topography will be compatible with the existing area.
A14.20 Safety
Working on a landfill can be dangerous, particularly when precautions are not taken. The most
frequently reported hazards are:
1. Direct exposure/contact with hazardous substances, ie. leachate, acids, bases, dusts,
infections, wastes, etc.
2. Accident through collisions of heavy vehicles
3. Inadequate maintenance of technical equipment
4. Accidental contact with sharp pointed objects
Constant supervision of the site is required to ensure that vehicles are in the correct place and are
able to tip satel> and reverse safely.
Inhalation of dust is an important health consideration
It is proposed that all staff undertake training programs thereby ensuring transfer of responsibility
when people are on leave.
First aid kits must be provided on site and properly maintained. Several staff members should be
trained in First Aid and a Safety Officer appointed.

B1 Executive Summary
1B1.1 Summary of Key Elements
This Environmental Impact Assessment concludes that only minor controls a,e required
particularly during the c onstruction stage to ensure that the proposed reservoir at Hailaast
is environmentally sound
The Project proposes to construct a water supply reservoir on a hilltop on the northern side of the
Hailaast Ger area. Construction of the reservoir and the transmission pipeline from the North East
(Dari Ekh) reservoir is programmed for 1997. The main environmental impacts are during the
construction stage and these can be controlled
The site geology has been investigated by borehole drilling across the site
A borehole was drilled at the site to a depth of 3.30 metres which was 400mm into bedrock.
The existing environment is already disturbed
There is now virtually no vegetation on the site, and the site is already disturbed in terms of
vehicles and foot traffic therefore the impact on flora and fauna will be insignificant.
Balanced earthworks construction proposed
The cut and fill construction will require minimal importing of fill material or the export of spoil
material from the site
An environmental management plan has been developed for the site
The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) covers all phases of the development from
preconstruction to operation and maintenance. The main element of the EMP is a checklist for
problems relating to construction and operations particularly for soil erosion/silt run off.
45



B2 Introduction
B2.1 General
The Project, on behalf of the Municipality of Ulaanbaatar proposes to build a concrete water supply
reservoir at Hailaast approximately 7 km to the North o& the city.
The reservoir would be constructed in 1997 and would be operational in 1998. A second similar
reservoir is planned for construction in 2002.
B2.2 Approvals Process
Refer A2.2
46



B3 Description of Proposal
B3.1 Site Location
The proposed site at Hailaast is located approximately 7 km by road north of Ulaanbaatar by road.
Fig B3.1 - Locality Plan shows the location of the site in relation to the central business district of
Ulaanbaatar.
The proposed site is approximately 0.12 ha in area.
B3.2 Property Description
The property has no legal description (refer to clause A3.2)
B3.3 The Proposed Use of the Site
The site is proposed to be used for the construction and operation of a concrete water reservoir.
In addition, pipelines to and from the reservoir with necessary valves will also be installed.
Figure B3.2 - Site Plan shows the reservoir and pipelines proposed for construction.
B3.4 Planning Context
The proposed site does not come under any land use planning legislation. There are no dwellings
on the site or within 200 metres of the site and no involuntary resettlements are necessary.
47



B4. Construction and Operation of the Reservoir
The reservoir will be constructed in reinforced concrete and it will be buried with a minimum of 1.0
metre thickness of soil cover for insulation. The cut and fill earthworks will ensure that there is no
requirement for importing earthworks or exporting spoil material from the site.  The main
components of the reservoir are shown in Figure 84.1.
B4.1 Reservoir Size and Capacity
The reservoir dimensions will be 24 metres long by 14 metres wide by 4.3 metres high. The
capacity will be approximately 1500 cubic metres. It is proposed that this storage capacity will be
increased to 3000 cubic metres with the construction of an additional identical reservoir when
required by Ger area population demand.
B4.2 Final Landform
The final landform on completion of construction will be very similar to that existing prior to
construction. No part of the reservoir will be visible with the exception of the tops of the ventilation
pipes. The proposed cut and fill construction is shown in Figure B4.2.
B4.3 Reservoir Operation
The reservoir operation consists of the receipt of water via the transmission main, storage for up
to 24 hours and the distribution to the Ger areas of Dambadaarja, Chingeltei, Hailaast, Denjiin,
and Zuraght. The transmission of water from the pumping station will be controlled automatically
by telemetry with electrode sensors set at pre-determined levels to start and stop the pumps. In
the event of failure of the telemetry system, and the continued running of the pumps, excess water
will flow out the overflow pipe into the outlet drain. This drain leads to an existing scoured gully.
The outlet of this drain will be provided with concrete and rock scour protection.
The site will be enclosed with a 1.8 metre high chainwire fence and a security guard will be posted
at the site in a guard house at all times to prevent unauthorised entry to the reservoir compound.
The reservoir will require cleaning from time to time to remove the silt build-up and to clean the
internal walls. This requires emptying the reservoir by allowing the level to drop to the bottom
water level and then opening the scour valve to completely drain the reservoir to allow access by
maintenance staff. These operations will not result in any silt or other matter being deposited into
the outlet drain. Any silt or other matter will be removed by truck from the site.
48



B5 Existing Environment
B5.1 Soils and Geology
The proposed reservoir site is located in hilly country. The hill is at the southern end of a ridge,
either side of which the Ger areas of Hailaast and Chingeltei are situated. The reservoir position is
approximately 40 metres to the south of the hill top and the top water level (TWL) will be EL 1470
(Approximately 9 metres below the top of hill level) The finished level of the soil cover over the
reservoir will be a further two metres higher than TWL at EL 1472. The hillside gradients are 14
to the south, 19 to the west and 15.6 to the east.
The geological description of the site is Paleozoic Carboniferous - 2.9 metres of eroded shale
together with sand and gravel overlay the basement rock which is dense shale. Test drilling over
the site by was carried out by the Building Design Institute and details are provided in Figure B5.1
- Geotechnical Investigation.
B5.2 Climate in Hailaast
The climate description is based on the data of Takhilt meteorology station which is located about
2 km from the proposed Hailast water reservoir. The average temperature of January is -21.6 0C -
the absolute minimum temperature is -46.0°C and the annual average is -1.3 "C. The monthly
average of the warmest month, July is +1 6.7C and the absolute maximum is +35 C.
From mid May daily average temperatures are generally above 1 0°C. From mid October daily
average temperatures are generally below 00C. Total daily average air temperature above IC is
+20.07'C, total daily average air temperature below 'C is -27.020C .
Average soil temperature in January is -270C with an absolute minimum temperature of -500C. In
July the average soil temperature is +23C with an absolute maximum soil temperature of +60°C.
The annual average depth of precipitation is 260mm, and 94% of this occurs in the period from
April to October. The duration of precipitation is highly variable.
Stable snow cover usually begins in November, however it be as late as October. In spring from
late March to early April the snow melts. The average number of snow days is 110 per year. The
average thickness of snow is 10-13 cm but sometimes it can reach 20-30 cm.
The average wind speed is 1.8 m/s. The predominant wind direction is from the north-west with
40.3% frequency. The maximum recorded wind speed is 28 m/s. The annual average number of
days with wind more than 15m/s is 10 days, however it can reach 30 days. The annual average
number of dust days is 30-35 days and snow/wind days is 12 per year.
49



B5.3 Flora
The following vegetation is found within this site - thin hairy sand wort, Chinese stellera,
heteropappus, fringed sagebrush, changed wormwood, large headed wormwood etc, thread leaf
crazy weed, Lenen fescue, hardy and foot shaped sedge, Altaian chamaerhodos, tarragon,
warawaleaf Peashrub, Gobian thyme.
The hills between Hailast and Chingeltei aie located in a medium section of the Daguural-
Mongolian region for flora and topographic classification. The Hailast hill is located on the north
side of Ulaanbaatar and is classified as a lower hill of eroded rock.
The hillside classifications can be summarised as follows.
hl- hill downside. This area grows thin hairy sand wort, Chinese stellera, heteropappus, fringed
sagebrush, changed wormwood, largehead wormwood etc. .
h2- middle section of hill. The plant cover is generally less than 10% and consists of fringed
sagebrush and thread leaf Crazy weed.
h3- top side of hill. The plant cover is less than 10% and includes Lenen Fescue, hardish and foot
shaped sedge, fringed sagebrush, Chinese stellera, heteropappus, Altaian chamaerhodos and
tarragon.
h4- top of hill. The plant cover is less than 10%. The little vegetation that grows in this topographic
classification includes warawleaf Peashrub, but the main types are thin hairy sand wort, tarragon,
Gobian thyme and Altaian chamaerhodos .
Uncommon and rare plants are not indicated.
According to the above list of plants ( for Moringiin Davaa and Hailaast ) there are 40 species from
16 plant families. None of these plants are included in the Mongolian Red Book (of rare or
endangered species).
B5.4 Fauna
There are no indications of mammals at the site.
The proposed water reservoir area is located on an elevated site. The soils of the area are derived
from eroded rock and have pebble and sand filling.
The fauna was defined approximately. There are no mammals. Five species of birds and 17
species of insects (from 4 families) were identified as listed below.
Birds:
1. Hodded Crow
2. Domestic Rock Dove
3. Tree Sparrow
4. House Sparrow
5. Black Kite
Insects:
1. Tenebrionidae
1.1. Blaps reflexa
1.2. Melaxumia rugibrous
1.3. Anatolica allicola
2. Coleoptera
2.1. Pallasiola absinthi
2.2. Scytosoma pygmaea
3. Carabidal-Rnauth
3.1. Harpalus amplicollis

4. Meloidae
4.1. Lytta caraganae
4.2. Mylabris dashdorzi
4.3. Epicauta mongolica
5. Curculionide
B5.5 Noise and Air Quality
Noise and air quality values are typical for an undeveloped hilltop located above a ger area
settlement.
B5.6 Archaeology and Cultural History
No features of archaeological or cultural history significance were indicated for the site.
B5.7 Land Use
The main use is residential at greater than 200-300 metres from the site when slopes are
sufficiently flat to allow building. Where the slopes are not too steep grazing is livestock is
undertaken
B5.8 Visual Amenity
The landscape of the area is predominantly residential. The site is clearly visible from many
locations in the vicinity.
B5.9 Existing Traffic Situation
There is no constructed road to this site. Some vehicles are driven over the hilltop as a short route
from sections of Hailaast to Chingeltei. A bitumen sealed access road is proposed for construction
in Year 2 (1998) of the project.

B6. Site Hydrogeology
B6.1 Surface Drainage
As the site is on a hilltop there is no catchment and therefore no surface water runoff.
B6.2 Sub-surface Seepage
From the geotechnical investigation, the average thickness of weathered shale is 2.9 metres. No
seepage into this layer is anticipated as this would indicate reservoir leakage.
52



B7 Other Impacts
B7.1 Noise
Noise levels will increase during construction with the operation of earthmoving equipment. This is
expected to last about four months.
B7.2 Visual Amenity
The completed reservoir will be buried with the exception of the tops of the ventilation pipes. A
security fence and a guard house will be erected on the site. The visual amenity could be
improved with the planting of suitable shrubs and trees.
B7.3 Dust and Odour
There will be some impact of dust from the earthmoving plant and machinery during the
construction phase. Odour problems could arise if the effluent from the construction camp is not
properly disposed. A standard pit latrine with insect screens and venting will be sufficient for this
purpose.
B7.4 Soil Erosion and Silt Runoff
Soil erosion and silt runoff during construction operations can be prevented with the use of silt
traps such as hay bales to prevent any erosion or loss of silt material from the site. This item will
need to be closely supervised by the contractor foreman and checked by the Construction Project
Manager.
53



B8 Environmental Management Plan
The purpose of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is to address the various stages of
construction and operation of the reservoir. The EMP can be read in isolation from the EIA and it
forms part of the operations manual which should be prepared prior to commencement of the
reservoir operations.

The specific pipes and valves which need replacement have not been identified in this Phase
2 study, but it is understood that USAG have some indication of which are the weak links,
and with field testing could identify specific items.
Therefore it is recommended:
* Weak pipe links and valves around the north eastern areas be gradually replaced as part of a
regular maintenance program to enable ihe upper source to be utilized for general improvement of
pressures in the city network. It is understood that pipe segments at present are designed for
working pressure of 100 to 120 meters pressure, but in practice break down at around 60 to 80
meters head. For valves it is not known what is the actual maximum pressure which the valves
can withstand.
Identification of the weak links, valves, etc. should be undertaken under a separate program and
possibly seek assistance from foreign donor agencies and be included with a leak detection
program. The weak links could include, old pipes segments, valves, and pipe joints (butt welded
steel pipe joints, caulked joints).
