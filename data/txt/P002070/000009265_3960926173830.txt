On September 26, 1986, Nigeria adopted a flexible exchange rate policy and
introduced a second-tier foreign exchange market (SFEM) comprising an
auction and interbank market. On July 2, 1987, SFEM and the official
(i.e., first-tier) rates were merged. All foreign exchange transactions
now take place at market-determined exchange rates. The foreign exchange
market (FEM) is a combination of an auction (fortnightly) on the basis of
the Dutch system, and a dealer market which operates in response to supply
and demand.  The FEM rate in the auction of July 7, 1988 was US$l = N4.47.
A rate of US$1 = 14.00 has been used for project analysis.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIm DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR A PRIVATE SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recosmendation on a proposed loan to
the Federal Republic of Nigeria for US$270 millJon equivalent is submitted
for approval. The proposed loan would be on standard Bank terms with 20
years maturity, including a five-year grace period.
2.        Background.  With buoyant oil revenues and heavy public
investments, manufacturing output in Nigeria grew rapidly at an average
rate of about 12Z p.a. between 1973 and 1982. Overall GDP grew at 3.7?
p.a. during the same decade, and the share of manufacturing in GDP
consequently rose from 41 in 1973 to a peak of 10.3S in 1982. Between 1982
and 1986, however, real manufacturing output declined sharply in every year
except in 1985. At the end of 1986, the share of manufacturing in GDP was
about 9.72. In 1987, manufacturing sector recovered modestly with an
estimated growth of about 4?. Capacity utilization has been low in recent
years, averaging about 30?. Enterprise profitability has, therefore,
dropped and many firms are heavily indebted. The poor performance is to a
large extent attributable to (a) distorted incentives which contributed to
excessive import dependence of the industrial sector, and low level of
domestic value added; anu (b) the decline in economic activity since 1980
with the collapse in oil revenues.
3.        In 1986, the Government adopted an ambitious and far reaching
program of reforms for structural adjustment of the economy. To
rationalize the incentive system, it has: (a) introduced a market-
determined exchange rate; (b) abolished import licensing and sharply
reduced the number of items subject to import prohibitions; (c) reduced the
average level and dispersion of tariffs; and (d) dismantled controls on
ex-factory prices.  Ceilings on interest rates have also been removed.  To
promote non-oil exports, the Government has abolished export licensing,
removed export duties, simplified export procedures, introduced a refinance
facility, approved a duty drawbackisuspension scheme for exporters,
prepared a decree for the reorganization of the Nigerian Export Promotion
Council, and allowed the retention of export earnings. To stimulate
private investment, the Government has reduced the corporate income tax,
allowed tax free dividends on imported capital, lowered taxes on investment
income, increased capital allowances, and allowed a lower tax rate for
smaller enterprises. The Industrial Development Coordinating Committee is
being established as a one-stop investwont facilitating and promotional
body. The Government has announced ice aecision for the privatization/
commercialization of some 135 public enterprises. Progress in
rationalizing the public investment program has, however, lagged somewhat.
4.        A substantial increase in private Jector investment is now
essential to lay a firm basis to generate sustainable economic growth and
employment over the medium term. It would, however, require a more stable
policy environment, simplification of approvallregulatory procedures, and
appropriate fiscal incentives to investors. A proposed Trade and
Investment Policy Loan aims at deepening the reforms already taken as well



-2-
as at improving the climate for investment in the private sector and
rationalizing the public sector investment program. The Government has
placed a major emphasis on the development of small and medium scale
enterprises (SMEs) in prod-active sectors as potential sources of increased
broad-based private sector investment and a sustained supply response
consistent with Nigeria's resource endowments. SMEs generally create
employment at low investment costs with quick paybacks, promote regional
development, use local raw materials intensively, provide seed-beds for
development of entrepreneurial talent and industrial capabilities. and have
the potential to establish productive linkages with the agriculture sector
and the larger industrial enterprises. But the limited availability of
term resources and equity financing, insufficient working capital as well
as weaknesses in the institutional support system are important constraints
to the development of SMEs. The Bank has to date made five loans for
industrial finance; the first three were satisfactorily completed, and the
most recent two loans are nearly fully committed. Lessons learned from
these operations have been taken into account in designing the proposed
project.
5.        Rationale for Bank involvement.  The project is an integral part
of Bank assistance to Nigeria for structural adjustment of its economy.
With the ongoing economic reforms supported by the Bank, an appropriate
incentive system for growth of the private industrial sector is largely in
place, and a favorable climate for private sector investment is gradually
being established. The economy is starting to respond to the dramatic
changes in relative prices which emphasize domestic resource-based
industries and a shift to an industrial structure consistent with Nigeria's
resource endowments. The first evidence of this shift is in new SMEs which
are now being establiehed. With the removal of ceilings on all interest
rates, the main impediment for term financing particularly for SMEs has
also been removed. Yet, it will take some time for the liberalization
measures to work through the system, and there are a number of market
imperfections which discriminate against SMEs, including poor access to
information, high transaction costs, and inadequate collaterals. A
comprehensive program of assistance to SMEs at this time is, therefore,
pivotal in facilitating the resumption of broad-based growth and efficient
employment generation along side the ongoing economic reforms. The
proposed project would address these bottlenecks, and provide credit for
the private sector at large for the overall development of the SHE sector.
6.        Proiect Obiectives.  The project is designed tot  (a) support
existing enterprises, restructure and modernize their operations in
maintaining their comparative advantage, and to regain competitiveness
under the new incentive system; (b) help establish a new generation of
viable investments in the private productive sectors and service
activities; and (c) improve the quality and range of financial and
extension services available to SMEs. The project is aimed'ats (i)
enabling private small and medium entrepreneurs to become more competitive
by investing in the rehabilitation and expansion of their existing units,
and establish new enterprises; (ii) reviving production and improving
viability of selected overleveraged firms through establishing an
institutional and financial framework to plan, implement, and support
restructuring programs; (iii) supporting a program of assistance to
microenterprises; (iv) providing an alternative and more flexible source of
long-term financing to SMEs through equipment leasing; (v) supporting
Entrepreneurship Development Programs; (vi) making the delivery of



-3-
technical support services more demand driven and responsive to SME needs;
and (vii) improving the policy framework for the development of SMEs.
7.        Proiect Description.  The project includes:  (a) a Line
of Credit Component (US$200 million) to finance, through the banking
system, fixed investments and working capital requirements of existing and
new private sector, 1002 Nigerian-owned SMEs except in subsistence
agriculture, real estate, commerce, finance and insurance, hotels and
construction. Existing fixed assets (excluding land) plus investment under
the project (asset size) for eligible SMEs would not exceed US$2.5 million.
In order to benefit smaller enterprises, US$100 millVon out of the total
line of credit would be earmarked for financing SHE with an asset size
belov US$1.25 million, including US$25 million to fl±aance free standing
working capital needs of existing SMEs to improve capacity utilization and
help maintain employment.  The remaining US$100 million of the total line
of credit would support SMEs with an asset size between US$1.25 million and
US$2.5 million, including US$25 million for financing free standing working
capital; (b) a Pilot Financial Restructuring Component (US$20 million) to
help initiate a restructuring program for viable enterprises which are
currently facing financial difficulties. It would also redress other
underlying causes of the financial problems (e.g. management inadequacies,
physical bottlenecks in plants, etc). The Bank loan proceeds would finance
the preparation of restructuring plans, fresh working capital, new fixed
assets and technical assistance needs; (c) a Pilot Mutualist Credit
Guarantee Scheme (US$5 million) to provide microenterprises, in
collaboration with selected non-governmental organizations such as the
Manufacturers' Association of Nigeria and Nigeria Association of Small
Scale Industrialists, access to institutional credit for fixed investment
and working capital. Hicroenterprises because of their small size and lack
of collateral are unable to borrow from normal banking channels; and (d)
an EauiDment LeasinR Component (US$30 million) to provide an alternative
source of long-term financing to SMEs that are under-capitalized and
generally have less collateral.
8.        In addition, the project includes a Technical Assistance
Component (US$9.3 million) for: (a) the establishment of a Pilot Studies
Facility to finance through the banking system and on loan terms, the
consultancy costs for feasibility studies and other technical assistance
needs of SMEs and entrepreneurs; (b) training for SMEs in simple business
skills; (c) expert assistance to the SME Apex Unit in CBN for administering
the SHE credit components; (d) training for PBs in project appraisal and
supervision and preparation of enterprise restructuring workouts; (e) the
implementation design of the mutualist credit guarantee scheme for
microenterprises; (f) studies on an appropriate policy and regulatory
framework for equipment leasing, and the establishment of a mutual
investment fund to facilitate the participation of private investors in
holding shares in corporate enterprises particularly those involving
restructuring; (g) monitoring regularly the economic and social impact of
the SME subprojects (tracer studies); (h) periodic reviews of and
improvements in the nationwide Entrepreneurship Development Programs; (i)
developing linkages between SMEs and larger enterprises through
subcontractings (j) conducting subsector surveys and developing industry
profiles; (k) encouraging linkages between SMEs and research institutions
for technological development; (1) assessing alternatives for implementing
an industrial estates program on a commercial basis with participation of
the private sector; (m) further policy and project preparation work in the



- 4 -
industrial and financial sectors; and (n) strengthening of operations of
NBCI. In view of the pilot nature of some components, the project includes
an unallocated US$5.7 million which could subsequently be allocated by the
Bank to any project component during implementation.
9.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$415.8 million
equivalent, including a foreign exchange component of US$263.4 million
(63Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key pro4ect
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Nigeria are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, Ne. 7114-UNI dated September 23, 1988 is also
attached.
10.       Aareed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following:  (a)
onlending arrangements for the SHE credit components, and the Pilot Studies
Facility; eligibility criteria for the PBs, beneficiary enterprises and
subprojects; subloan processing procedures; and onlending terms and
conditions; (b) reviews at least once every year of the project progress to
identifying and making necessary changes for successful implementation of
the project; (c) establishment of the Pilot 1,tudies Facility by December
1988; (d) completion of studies on the formulation of implementation
procedures for the mutualist credit guarantee scheme by March 1989, and
development of an appropriate regulatory and policy framework for equipment
leasing by June 1989, (e) employment of consultants for strengthening of
NBCI's operations by February 1989; (f) implementation schedules and
arrangements for other technical assistance and training activities; and
(g) the Government to use the funds, repaid by the PBs but not yet due to
the Bank, to finance SHEs with objectives and financing arrangements
consistent with those under the project. An SME Apex Unit has been
established in the Central Bank of Nigeria to take charge of the project.
Cenditions of loan effectiveness are: (i) signing the subsidiary
administration agreement between the Government and CBSI (ii) satisfactory
arrangements for the employment of consultants to assist the SHE Apex Unit
in the administration and oper tion of the SHE credit components and the
Pilot Studies Facility; (iii) issuance by CBN of a circular to the banking
system outlining the conditions and procedures for the utilization of funds
under the SHE credit components and the Pilot Studies Facility; (iv)
signing of participation agreements between the CBN and at least three Pls
for the line of credit component; and lv) establishment of a Project
Coordination Committee to ensure effective coordination and implementation
of the project. Specific conditions of disbursement are: (a) for each PB
receiving loan funds, signing with CBN of a participation agreement
specifying the conditions and procedures for the utilization of funds under
the SME credit components and the Pilot Studies Facility; (b) adoption by
CBN of detailed implementation procedures for the mutualist credit
guarantee scheme; and (c) signing of an agreement between the Government
and NBCI for technical assistance.
11.       Benefits.  The integrated package of institutional and financial
support programs under the proposed project would foster a stronger private
sector. The project would provide critical support to the Government's
efforts to stimulate economically efficient private productive activities
and thereby generate a sustained supply response in the contest of the new
policy environment. Resumption of growth and employment are major
Government objectives to stimulate the economy and partially alleviate the



social cost of the adjustment process. SMEs are expected to be in areas
consistent with Nigeria's resource endowments and within the local
management capacity. They would help develop: (a) significant linkages
with the agricultural sector and larger industrial enterprises; (b) scarce
entrepreneurial capabilities and first generation lcal entreprenenirs; and
(c) management skills and technological infusion. The project would
improve the quality and range of financial services available to the SME
sector. The Pilot Studies Facility would help SHEs obtain consultancy
services of their choice for preparation of feasibility studies, and make
the provision of technical assistance demand driven through the involvement
of the private sector and the banking system. Pr'vision of technical
assistance to and training for CBN, PBs, FMI, and NBCI would enhance their
capacities for developing and implemeuiting SME support programs more
effectively.
12.       Risks.  A major risk of the loan is the possible reluctance of
banks to engage in term financing for SMEs, perceived generally as more
risky than traditional commercial financing, and this could result in a
slow disbursement of the loan. This risk has been minimized as the PBs
will be free to determine the final onlending rates to beneficiary
enterprises. Another risk is that delays in the resumption of economic
growth and high interest rates may dampen investment demand. This risk is
mitigated in part by the overall size of the credit components which are
based on conservative demand estimates. Moreover, the Pilot Studies
Facility would help generate a significant pipeline of bankable SHE
subprojects, and the participation of the entire banking system with
extensive branch networks would extend the outreach of the project in all
parts of the country, which would further mitigate this risk. The pilot
financial restructuring component and the pilot mutualist credit guarantee
scheme could also encounter a difficult start-up because of their newness.
To minmi4ze this risk, the amounts allocated to these components are
relatively small, and the project includes technical assistance for the
preparation of restructuring workouts. Finally, in view of the
multi-component nature of the Project, and the past experience of weak
project implementation in Nigeria, there is always the risk of clogged
paper work which may slow down project implementation. To mitigate this
risk, the project relies largely on the banking system which is more
efficient than Government departments or agencies.  The SE Apex Unit in
CBN, however, would have mainly an administrative role for the credit
components. The project also includes technical assistance to the SME Apex
Unit.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
