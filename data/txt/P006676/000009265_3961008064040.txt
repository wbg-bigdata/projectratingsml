MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK
FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE
FOR A
SECANO RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND NATURAL RESOURCE
MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Chile for US$15.0 million. The loan would be at the standard interest rate
for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans, with a maturity of 15 years, and would help
finance a Rural Poverty Alleviation and Natural Resource Management Project in the Secano area of
Chile.
2.     Sector Background. The success of the dynamic Chilean agricultural sector in the 1980s was
due to progressive macroeconomic and trade policies, complemented by innovative sectoral measures.
From 1984 to 1994, driven by remarkable annual investment and export growth rates, averaging 14.3
percent and 9.9 percent respectively, GDP increased by an average annual rate of 6.8 percent.
During the same period, the annual inflation rate declined from 23 percent to 8.9 percent. Moreover,
with a Government strongly committed to sound economic structures and policies, this growth pattern
is expected to continue and an average annual economic growth rate of 6.0 percent is projected over
the next decade.
3.     The challenge will be to maintain economic growth while ensuring that every segment of
society benefits. Despite the sustained growth of the economy and agricultural sector over the last ten
years, more than a third of the population continues to live in poverty, with an important segment of
this population located in rural areas.
4.     Many of Chile's poorest municipalities are in the Secano, the coastal and inland zones along
the slopes of the Coastal Mountain Range, covering 5.7 million ha in Regions V to X. More than half
the Secano's soils are eroded. Nearly 45 percent of the area is pasture, most of which has been
degraded through over-grazing. A third is forested or used for non-agricultural purposes. Basic
grains, fruit trees, table grapes, vegetables and flowers are cultivated on the agricultural lanids, about
15 percent of the total area.
5.     The project encompasses Chile's poorest rural population, living in highly fragile, yet diverse
natural environments. The project's area of influence in the Secano, in Regions VI through VIII,'
covers 3.5 million ha in four agro-ecological zones. About 0.9 million ha are arable, 0.6 million ha
are suited for pasture and about 2.0 million ha are suited for forestry. The project area has 2 million
1.    Information refers to Secano Regions VI to VIII, the proposed project's area of influence. Region
numbers correspond to national administrative regions, beginning with Region I in the north and
extending to Region XII in the south. See Map No. IBRD 25588.



inhabitants, living in 68 municipalities.2 Nearly a fifth of the population, about 440,000 people, is
rural, of whom most are poor.3 Between 1982 and 1992, while the Secano population grew by 13.2
percent, its rural population, because of the area's harsh economic conditions, fell by 8 percent.
6.     Project Objectives. Despite its substantial agro-forestry potential, the Secano is economically
depressed, with Chile's highest incidence of rural poverty. The region, which has remained beyond
the reach of national economic expansion and most social programs, needs targeted programs and
economic stimulation to alleviate poverty. The Project would address rural poverty and natural
resource degradation, mutually reinforcing problems, through the development and validation of
comprehensive strategies which can achieve sustainable rural poverty alleviation and economic growth
through increased family income and improved natural resource management.
7.     The Secano's diverse and fragile resource base, along with a lack of effective regional poverty
alleviation strategies, argues for a project which can validate alternative development approaches.
The heterogeneity of Secano conditions calls for a micro-regional approach, starting with pilot-scale
sub-projects in representative areas to test the technological, social and institutional actions considered
to be most likely to succeed. The project would attempt to develop viable strategies which would: (i)
improve natural resource management to reverse soil degradation and establish sustainable production
systems; and (ii) expand off-farm employment and economic infrastructure investments to diversify
income sources and boost regional development. The results of the micro-regional endeavors would
serve as technically and environmentally sound, and economically viable models for possible larger
government-funded programs, covering greater areas of the Secano.
8.    About 2,400 farm families, cultivating over 50,000 ha, would be the potential direct
beneficiaries of this project which would: (a) enhance natural resource management through
sustainable small-scale farming systems, where available resource endowments and economic
conditions are appropriate, through targeted applied research and technology transfer; (b) advance
environmentally sound forestry activities and pasture management; (c) support land title
regularization; (d) increase rural family income through: (i) increase of crop productivity and
diversification into higher-valued crops; (ii) creation of additional off-farm activities: (iii)
enhancement of off-farm employment skills; and (iv) improvement of infrastructure; (e) increase
participation of project beneficiaries and the respective municipalities in development planning,
management and execution; and (f) strengthen Government's technical capacity for overall natural
resource management.
9.     Project Description. Project components would include: (a) Natural Resource Management
and Sustainable Agricultural Development. This component would: (i) introduce irrigation
enabling small farmers to diversify into high-value crops and increase cropping intensities and
productivity; (ii) improve rainfed cultivation practices through applied research, technology transfer
and on-farm erosion control, including gully stabilization; (iii) improve pasture and livestock
management; and (iv) develop forestry activities on marginal, erosion-prone lands; (b) Off-Farm
Poverty Alleviation Investments. This component would be implemented through a Program for
Financing Poverty Alleviation Activities (PFAP) to finance grants and loans for natural resource

management, sustainable agriculture and off-farm activities. It would generate off-farm activities,
including small-scale agro-industries, handicrafts, kitchen gardens, as well as construct storage and
post-harvest handling facilities. The component would also help rehabilitate rural feeder roads and
improve marketing facilities; (c) Support Services, which would transfer technology to participating
farmers and support agricultural and forestry research; (d) Technical Assistance, which would
include consulting services, institutional strengthening and training; (e) Land Title Regularization;
and (f) Studies, which would: (i) assess the Secano's renewable natural resources, including a hydro-
geological survey; (ii) draft guidelines and legislative measures for natural resource protection within
the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture; and (iii) analyze agricultural marketing constraints and
options.
10.   Project Costs and Financing. The total cost of the project, to be implemented over 4.5
years, including contingencies, taxes and duties, is US$35.0 million equivalent, of which US$3.1
million equivalent (8.9 percent) represents foreign exchange costs. Estimated price contingencies,
US$1.74 million equivalent (5.3 percent of baseline costs), have been included at an annual rate of
2.5 percent between 1996 and 2000. Physical contingencies, except for technical assistance, studies,
vehicles, research and technology transfer, have been estimated at US$0.44 million equivalent, based
on 5 percent contingencies on civil works and equipment, and 10 percent on the training component.
11.    Schedule A summarizes the estimated project costs by component and project financing plan.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the allocation of loan proceeds are
shown in Schedules B-1 and B-2. Schedule C provides the timetable of project processing. The
status of Bank Group operations in Chile is given in Schedule D. A map (IBRD No. 25588) is
attached. The completion date for the project would be May 31, 2000, and the closing date would be
November 30, 2000.
12.   Project Implementation. The Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) would have overall
project authority. INDAP would be the Executing Agency, while its National Director, through the
Project Technical Unit (UTP), would manage the project. The UTP would provide technical,
managerial and administrative support in all project execution matters. The UTP would manage the
PFAP and would administer its resources. A Project Commission (Comite Superior de Proyecto,
CSP) would be chaired by the Director of INDAP. The Project Commission's responsibilities would
be to provide guidance and make recommendations on: project implementation strategy; the Annual
Operation Plans (POAs); rules, procedures and operational mechanisms of the Program for Financing
Poverty Alleviation Activities (PFAP); and guidelines for studies and technical assistance. The
Commission would also review the project's progress and its degree of beneficiarv participation. The
Minister of Agriculture would have the responsibility and authority to reconcile differences among
members of the Commission.
13.   With technical assistance from local consulting firms, universities, NGOs and the UTP,
beneficiaries would design and execute micro-regional natural resource management and agricultural
development programs. They would also design, present for funding and implement off-farm
investments. The municipalities, with project assistance, would participate in project execution,
monitoring and evaluation.
14.   After completion of feasibility studies, beneficiary investment proposals, approved by the
Director of INDAP, would be financed by the UTP-managed Program for Financing Poverty
Alleviation Activities (PFAP). Financial terms and conditions would vary, depending upon the
investment type and would be defined in the Implementation Manual. For example, funds for natural



- 4 -
resource management would generally be provided on a grant basis, and productive investments
would be financed on a partial capital cost recovery basis. Beneficiaries would contribute to all
investments with cash or in kind.
15.   Project Sustainability. The project, by introducing environmentally sound agricultural
practices, generating off-farm employment and increasing farm earnings, would contribute to
sustained economic growth in the Secano. The transfer of agricultural technologies suited to the
specific natural and economic conditions of the small-farmer would relieve pressures on fragile lands
and improve soil management. Without such project interventions, natural resource deterioration
would continue, ultimately rendering regional agriculture unsustainable. By fostering economically
sound enterprises, off-farm project investments would create long-term employment opportunities and
augment household income. In addition, the project would sustain increases in farm earnings through
crop diversification and intensification, the establishment of agro-industries, and generation of savings
which could be re-invested in the local economy.
16.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement. The portfolio of Bank financed
projects in Chile, comprising 16 projects with an undisbursed balance of US$529.2 million as of
September 30, 1995, has performed well. This experience highlights the importance of sound
macroeconomic and sectoral policies, complemented by a strong institutional framework and a skilled
civil service.
17.   In the past four decades, the Bank has extended to Chile nine agricultural loans, totalling
US$260.0 million. Early projects provided credit for modernization and expansion of agricultural
infrastructure. Small-farmer development and poverty alleviation, typified by the Small Farmer
Services Project (Ln. 3473-CH) and the Irrigation Development Project (PROMM, Ln.3528-CH),
were approved in 1992. Lessons from these experiences underscore the value of: (i) flexible project
design; (ii) beneficiary involvement; and (iii) retention of project preparation team members for
project execution.
18.   Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Government of Chile and the Bank have recently
agreed upon a new assistance modality reflecting Chile's desire for continued Bank technical
assistance and advisory services, along with its reduced need for resource transfers. The project
would provide considerable technical assistance to address one of the country's more serious pockets
of rural poverty.
19.    The project fully supports this modality, as contained in the Bank Group's Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), discussed at the Board on May 9, 1995, with the Secondary Education Quality
Improvement Project, by proposing to (a) directly alleviate poverty; (b) increase national technical
capacity to protect natural resources; and (c) support decentralization in the rural sector. As
recommended in the Agricultural Sector Review (1990) and the Strategy Paper for Rural Areas
(1994), the project targets small farmers, generates suitable production technologies and provides
additional employment opportunities to supplement household income. The project would reinforce
and benefit the on-going extension and land titling activities under the Small Farmer Services Project
(Ln. 3473-CH).
20.   Agreements Reached. Agreements were reached during negotiations on the following: (a)
adequate institutional arrangements for implementation for the agricultural research component, which
would respond to the needs of the project; (b) adequate and timely budgetary allocations would be
made available for all project components, during the implementation period; (c) levels of capital cost

recovery to be attained in sub-projects to be financed through the PFAP; (d) supervision of
construction by consultants or MOP regional offices; (e) a satisfactory Annual Work Plan (POA) for
1997 and subsequent years would be submitted to the Bank by March 31 of the year in question; (f)
the draft POA for 1996 project implementation; (g) to hold annual reviews not later than April 30 of
each year, starting in 1996, and a Mid-Term Review with the Bank not later than April 30, 1998, to
assess project implementation and impact, and to make necessary adjustments; and (h) a draft Project
Implementation Manual.
21.    As conditions of Loan Effectiveness, the Borrower would: (a) furnish to the Bank a final
POA for 1996, satisfactory to the Bank; (b) finalize legal and administrative arrangements for the
establishment of the CSP and the UTP; and (c) present a final Project Implementation Manual,
satisfactory to the Bank.
22.    Other Agreements and Assurances. The Borrower would establish, to the Bank's
satisfaction: (a) a project monitoring system no later than August 31, 1996; and (b) project accounting
procedures no later than two months after Loan Effectiveness.
23.   Poverty Category. Most Secano small farmers are poor and cultivate in ways which often
perpetuate natural resource deterioration, thereby deepening their own impoverishment. The project,
part of the Program of Targeted Interventions, would focus on farmers with less than 20 physical
hectares (or less than 5 ha equivalent of Class I irrigated land). Through beneficiary-identified
interventions, the project would improve family welfare by (i) increasing farn productivity; (ii)
expanding off-farm economic opportunities through job creation and training; and (iii) improving
economic infrastructure.
24.    Economic returns to land would increase by project-promoted soil conservation and
production technologies capable of sustaining increased production and income. The project would
expand employment opportunities for rural families, thus increasing income and easing pressures to
abuse natural resources. Women-oriented and accessible off-farm investments would be promoted.
Project-supported training would improve skills necessary to enter new labor markets and develop
rural enterprises.
25.   Environmental Aspects. Environmental impact assessments (EIA) of natural resource
management and agricultural development programs have been carried out by specialized consultants,
in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank and under the supervision of an
experienced environment specialist. These concluded that a significant project benefit would be the
positive environmental impact stemming from more rational natural resource use. Where agricultural
production would be intensified, chemical use would be scrutinized, minimizing potential negative
impacts. Project road improvement and rehabilitation works would conform to acceptable engineering
standards, with consequent positive environmental impacts.
26.   Program Objective Categories. The project promotes rural poverty alleviation and rational
natural resource management. Its objectives are to improve the well-being of poor farm households
by introducing sustainable agricultural technologies, employment opportunities and rural infrastructure
investments.
27.   Participatory Approach. The project was prepared in collaboration with the Government,
implementing agencies and potential beneficiaries. During project preparation, a socio-economic
study was carried out, applying techniques such as Beneficiary Assessment, Rapid Rural Appraisal



- 6 -
and Household Surveys, to solicit beneficiaries' views regarding the project's potential role in their
economic development. These findings were invaluable in defining the eventual project design.
28.    Project technical assistance would allow beneficiaries to design and implement sustainable
farm plans. The project's demand-driven PFAP would finance viable beneficiary-proposed off-farm
investment activities. The Local Development Councils would ensure, through adequate
representation of beneficiaries, including women and youth, that beneficiaries' demands are
effectively channelled to project management. Beneficiaries' capacity to participate fully in the
project would be strengthened through project support to municipality and farmer organizations.
29.    Projects Benefits. The project would begin to develop and implement a coherent strategy for
rural poverty alleviation and sustainable resource management in the Secano. Financial support,
technical assistance and technology development and transfer, based on the demands of small farmers
in selected, representative areas, would serve as a basis for the design of a rural poverty alleviation
strategy, and if proven successful, could be extended throughout the Secano. Given the project's
small size relative to the magnitude to regional poverty, the project could be viewed as a precursor to
possible larger Government-financed programs needed to reach the entire Secano population. The
proposed project would increase incomes of beneficiaries, through enhanced employment
opportunities and agricultural production. The project would encourage government decentralization,
strong beneficiary and municipal participation in discovering solutions for their priority issues, and
coordination of the activities of various agencies currently providing basic services in the Secano.
30.    Estimated internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the natural resource management and
sustainable agricultural development component, and the rural feeder roads sub-component (including
the costs of the technology transfer program and the UTP) is 20.7 percent. The IERR includes
economic benefits derived from: (i) crop productivity gains, resulting from improved practices; (ii)
crop diversification into higher-valued crops; (iii) decreased production costs; and (iv) reduced
marketing margins, due to better rural infrastructure were taken into account and applied to indicative
farm models, representative of project beneficiaries in the Secano.4
31.    This IERR is very conservative as it does not capture important non-quantitative externalities,
such as those stemming from (i) reduced soil run-off and erosion; and (ii) containment of progressive
productivity losses due to declining soil fertility Furthermore, the analysis did not capture "without
project" productivity loses (as a project benefit) due to declining soil fertility
32.    For the off-farm investment component, as beneficiaries would determine which activities
would be financed under this component, an ex-ante estimation of costs and benefits can be made by
analyzing a sample of likely off-farm projects. The preparation team found that most proposals would
be small, ranging between US$25,000 and US$100,000, and economically highly feasible, having
estimated internal economic rates of return exceeding 25%. Since only technically and economically
sound proposals would receive project finance, this component would likely increase the project's
internal economic rate of return. To ensure economic viability, a minimum threshold of an estimated
internal economic rate of return would be applied as a selection criteria to sub-project proposals.

33.   Risks and Safeguards. Weak local institutional capacity could jeopardize Project
sustainability. The Project's program to strengthen local institutional planning, management and
budgeting capabilities is expected to reduce this risk. Without adequate targeted agricultural and
forestry research, the project's technology transfer component would be severely hampered. At
negotiations the Govermment reiterated its commitment to adequately fund research activities.
34.   Project success would rest on: (i) producer's acceptance; and (ii) a financtal mechanism which
would be both responsive to beneficiary demands and willing to assume part of the investment's risks.
Engaging potential beneficiaries in designing production systems and other measures to overcome
their development constraints is expected to generate project acceptance by small farmers. The PFAP
would be the financial mechanism which would address the second element by: (i) financing, rapidly
and efficiently, beneficiary proposals for on-farm development and off-farm activities; and (ii)
assuming investment risk, during the initial stages, by providing grants for some activities and co-
financing for others, depending on investment type and beneficiary's economic situation.
35.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it
