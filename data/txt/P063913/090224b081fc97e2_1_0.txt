                         The development objective of the Project is to improve the reliability and efficiency of the power system in Java-Bali and strengthen PLN and PGN's management

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has made important strides towards achieving its development objectives, but it is expected to have moderate shortcomings. Achievement of the utility strengthening
                         objectives is very clear. The Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system deployed under the project has substantially improved the management of finances, materials, and human
                         resources of PLN's business units in Java and Bali and therefore was scaled up for implementation in Sumatra and Sulawesi. Technical studies have also provided valuable inputs for

                         reducing of substation loadings, along with the construction of two transmission lines has been very successful, five other planned transmission lines are still only between 40 and 88
                         percent complete due to delays in securing the rights of way for some sections of the lines. Completion of these lines is expected only after the project is closed using PLN's own
                         budget. The degree to which this delay may affect the full realization of the project's transmission and power system reliability and on the project's efficiency benefits is under review.
