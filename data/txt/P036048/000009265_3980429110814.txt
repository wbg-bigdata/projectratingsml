2. Project development objective, global objective and keyperformance indicators (see Annex 1):
The development objective of the first Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project, which is also the
projects global objective, is to establish a viable framework for a national coral reef management system in
Indonesia. End-of-project indicators are shown as the benchmarks for Phase I in the previous table.
B: Strategic Context
1(a). Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the program (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 16691-IND                  Date of latest CAS discussion: June 13, 1997
The CAS and global goal supported by the program is the protection, rehabilitation, and sustainable use of coral
reefs and associated ecosystems in Indonesia which will, in turn, enhance the welfare of coastal communities.
The program meets the CAS objective to enhance equitable and sustainable development, through sustainable
marine resource management.  Its focus on policy and legal reform, strengthened enforcement, site
management, and close collaboration with other donors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are
consistent with the CAS strategy.
I (b). GEF Operational Strategy/program objective addressed by the program:
Global Importance
Indonesia is the world's largest archipelago, with more than 17,000 islands and an 81,000 km coastline rich in
coral reefs, seagrasses, and mangroves. It contains 2,500 species of mollusks, 2,000 species of crustaceans, 6
species of sea turtles, 30 marine mammals species, and over 2,000 fish species. Indonesia has approximately
75,000 km2 of coral reefs, or 12 to 15 percent of the world's total. With 362 scleractinian (hard) coral species
and 76 genera recorded, Indonesia lies at the epicenter of the world's coral reef diversity.
Despite their importance, Indonesia's coral reefs are believed to be under serious threat from poison and blast
fishing, over-fishing, and sedimentation and pollution.  In a 1994 survey of 371 national transects, the
Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) found 70 percent of the sites to be in poor to fair condition.  The only
known study of coral reef degradation over time, in Pulau Seribu off Jakarta Bay, shows a steady decline of 3-6
percent a year in live coral cover (LCC) since 1969. Urgent management interventions are therefore needed to
protect Indonesia's reefs.
Consistency with the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Strategy
The proposed program is consistent with GEF's Operational Strategy, in particular the Operational Program on
Marine, Coastal and Freshwater Ecosystems. It supports in situ conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity
consistent with Article 8 of the Convention on Biological Diversity and Agenda 21. It responds to guidance from
the Second Conference of Parties and the Jakarta Mandate's focus on coastal and marine ecosystems. It also
follows the guidance of the Third Conference of Parties with innovative measures to conserve and sustainably
use biodiversity, such as economic incentives, strengthened involvement of local communities in coral reef
management, and integration of social dimensions related to poverty.
The program focuses on a priority ecosystem identified in Indonesia's National Biodiversity Action Plan, and will
support conservation and management of globally important reefs identified in Indonesia's Marine Conservation
Atlas and the World Conservation Union (lUCN)'s Global Representative System of Marine ProtectedAreas. In
addition to coral reefs, the program will contribute to the conservation of other marine species, and address
issues affecting endangered fish populations as part of an intemational campaign against cyanide fishing.
Finally, the program will help manage an area which is believed to contain the richest coral reef, fish, and marine
invertebrate biodiversity in the world. The program has been endorsed by Indonesia's GEF focal point, the GEF

Council in May 1997, and the GEF Chief Executive Officer on March 3, 1997.
2. Main sector issues and Govemment straegy:
Sector Importance
Coral reefs are a major productive and aesthetic asset in Indonesia, p,laying a key role in fisheries, marine
tourism  and coastal protection.   Healthy reefs can produce manne products worth on average
US$15,000/km2/year, and are an important source of food and economic opportunities for some 67,500 coastal
villages. Coral reefs play also an important role in marine-based tourism, attracting divers and providing the
source of white sand for Indonesia's beaches.  The tourism value of coral reefs has been estimated at
US$3,000/ km2 in low potential areas, to nearly US$500,0001 km2 in high potential sites. Fringing coral reefs
also play key roles in dissipating wave energy, thereby protecting coastal lands from storms and wave erosion.
The net benefits of coastal protection are estimated at US$25,000 to US$550,000 per km2 of reef, depending on
the value of coastal infrastructure'.
Key Issues
The key issues affecting Indonesia's coral reefs are (i) poor management of existing threats; (ii) unclear
institutional mandates and inadequate institutional capacity; (iii) a weak policy and legal framework; and (iv)
insufficient information.  Overfishing, destructive practices (bombing and cyanide fishing) and mining are the
main threats identified in the COREMAP I pilot areas. These threats are exacerbated by a high demand for
marine products, opportunities for substantial private gains, weak enforcement of existing laws, and an open
access regime that discourages community action.  Responsibility for managing Indonesia's marine areas
remains dispersed through numerous govemment agencies, and adequate institutional capacity has yet to be
developed. Policies and regulations tend to follow sectoral priorities, and tail to properly address coastal issues.
Legal loopholes such as prohibiting cyanide fishing but allowing its use to tranquilize fish make it extremely
difficult to enforce existing jaws. Finally, information required for marine rnanagement remains fragmented, not
standardized, and difficult to access.
Govemment Strategy
The Govemment of Indonesia (GOI) has identified coral reef management as a national priority. In 1992, the
Ministry of Environment (LH), produced a National Strategy and Action Plan for Coral Reef Ecosystem
Conservation and Management, which recommends: (i) community awareness and participation; (ii) improved
management of existing marine conservation areas and expansion to new sites; (iii) improved spatial planning
and zonation; (iv) institutional coordination; and (v) a research program for coral reefs. Both the Indonesian
Biodiversity Action Plan (1993) and Indonesia's Agenda 21 (1996) emphasize community-based marine
resources management. GOI has also launched several recent sectoral initiatives, including the 1992
Sustainable Marine Program (Program Laut Lestan), and a new, high-level, inter-ministerial National Marine
Council (DKN), established in 1997 to coordinate marine management in Indonesia. Fisheries and coastal
tourism have been identified as priority programs for the next five-year devielopment plan, commencing in 1998.
Regulations are also being considered to decentralize coastal resources' jurisdiction to provincial govemments,
an initiative that should improve the management of highly mobile threats. Intemationally, Indonesia has played
an active role in marine biodiversity issues, hosting the Experts' Meeting of the Jakarta Mandate on Marine and
Coastal Biological Diversity in March 1997, and winning the bid to host the Year 2000 Intemational Coral Reef
Symposium.
3. Sector Issues to be addressed by the program and sftrategic choices:
There is a growing realiation in Indonesia that Govemment agencies cannot effectively manage such extensive
reef areas without the close involvement of coastal villages. A community-based management (CBM) approach
See Cesar 1996: Economic Analysis of Indonesian Coral Reefs. The amounts represent net present value over 25 years.



Page 5
Indonesia: Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project
cannot be successful, however, without a supporting framework to contain external threats.  This framework
needs to include: (i) an effective national strategy for coral reef management; (ii) secure user rights for coastal
communities;  (iii) effective enforcement to protect communities against external threats;  (iv) increased
awareness amongst decision makers of the threats facing the reefs; and (v) strengthened management capacity.
The COREMAP program has made the strategic choice to address these basic requirements during the initiation
ph-as, and phase interventions at the site level over a period of 15 years. Proceeding cautiously and using a
process approach, the program will ensure that the lessons learned from pilot locations are applied to a later,
expanded acceleration phase.
C: Program and Project Description Summary
I (a) The Indonesia Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Program (see also Annex 14)
The national COREMAP program will cover priority locations in ten provinces in Indonesia (South, North and
Southeast Sulawesi, Riau, North and West Sumatra, Maluku, Irian Jaya and East and West Nusa Tenggara),
during a period of 15 years. The program is being supported by the World Bank, GEF, the Asian Development
Bank (ADB), the Australian Agency for Intemational Development (AusAID), and the Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA), with GEF providing funding for Phases I and il. The respective donors' roles in the
2
COREMAP program have been specified over the course of two joint missions in 1997 .  Even though the
adaptable program loan (APL) and grant conditions apply only to the Bank and GEF funded portion of the
program, ADB, AusAID and JICA plan to fund complementary projects under the COREMAP program umbrella.
The donors would operate under a collaborative arrangement, and jointly evaluate the results of the Initiation
phase prior to proceeding to Phase il.
The adaptable program financing will closely match the program's investment needs, which are expected to
decrease progressively from approximately 92 percent of the total costs during Phase I to 70 percent during
Phase Ill. At program conclusion, the majority of the costs will be recurrent. Major capital expenditures in
surveillance, technical assistance and capacity building will be phased out as the program matures, and be
replaced by a supporting framework for reef management at the site level, funded primarily by GOI (see Phase
Ill description). GOI will fund the bulk of recurrent expenditures under all program phases (including an
estimated 74 percent during Phase I).
COREMAP Phase I (Initiation, 3 years):
The Initiation phase will establish the national framework for the COREMAP program, test community-based
management in four sites (in Maluku, South Sulawesi, Riau and East Nusa Tenggara), carry out initial program
activities in the other six provinces, and prepare for the Acceleration Phase.
The Bank/GEF will support, under the first Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project:
*  A strengthened COREMAP program policy, strategy, and action plan.
*  A strengthened legal framework for coral reef management in Indonesia;
*  A national awareness and social marketing campaign;
*  A surveillance and enforcement system tested at the national level and in three target provinces;
*  Pilot community based management in two sites (Taka Bone Rate National Park in South Sulawesi
and Lease Islands in Maluku).

Indonesia: Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Managemenet Project
Other Donors would support (under parallel projects):
* A national coral reef information, research and monitoring system, and Coral Reef Information and
Training Centers (CRITCs) in Jakarta, Riau, Maluku, South Sulawesi and East Nusa Tenggara
(funded by ADB);
* National capacity building and training (funding requested from AusAID);
* Pilot community-based management and enforcement in Senayang Islands, Riau (funded by ADB),
and Kupang Bay, East Nusa Tenggara (funding requested frorn AusAID);
* Initial CBM activities in six provinces (funded separately by GCII).
COREMAP Phase 11 (Acceleration, 6 years):
The Accelerafion Phase would expand viable community-based management systems to priority sites in ten
provinces, according to their degree of readiness. Supporting activities are expected to include integrated
planning, a reef monitoring and evaluation system, expanded site surveillance, and a progressive
decentralization of program management to regional goveMments.
The Bank/GEF would likely support, under the Second Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project,
the following activities in Maluku, South Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi and Irian Jaya:
* Management of priority coral reef sites (including globally important areas such as the Wakatobi,
Spermonde, and Padaido Islands);
* Strengthened site surveillance and containment of national mobile threats;
* Strengthened program management capacity at the district and provincial levels;
* Regional awareness and participation; and
* Preparation for COREMAP Ill.
Other Dono  would likely support (under parallel projects):
* Site management and program support in North Sumatra, West Sumatra, and Riau (funding
requested from ADB), East and West Nusa Tenggara (funding requested from AusAID), and North
Sulawesi (funding likely to be requested from bilateral donors).
* Expansion of CRITCs to all program provinces (funding requested from ADB);
* Research center in Lombok (funding requested from JICA);
COREMAP Phase Ill (Institutionalization, 6 years):
During this phase, the COREMAP program would be fully institutionalized at the regional level, with sustainability
ensured through a combination of local govemment financing, specific: block grant transfers to regional
govemments (Inpres Pengendalian Dampak Lingkungan), and user pay schemes at the site level.  Phase Ill
would continue to expand the program to other priority sites in Indonesia. The focus of capacity building efforts
would be on district govemments.
The Bank would likely support, under the Third Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project:
*  Expansion of COREMAP Program to further priority sites in Eastem Indonesia.
* Local capacity building and development of sustainable financing mechanisms.
Other Donor would likely support COREMAP program expansion to priority sites in Western Indonesia and
Nusa Tenggara.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Program Coordination
The program's institutional arrangements will be used as a basis for project management during COREMAP 1.
The National Development Planning Board (BAPPENAS) will be the program's coordinating agency.   A
COREMAP Steering Committee headed by Deputy IV for Human Resources will provide program guidance and
policy coordination.    The Committee will include representatives from  agencies involved in coral reef
management as well as eminent persons representing the non-governmental and private sectors. A National
Secretariat chaired by BAPPENAS will coordinate the program's operational inputs. The Secretariat will be
assisted by a Project Management Office (PMO) responsible for day-to-day project planning, budgeting,
monitoring, and reporting.  The PMO will be staffed by a highly qualified full-Ume Director seconded from
BAPPENAS, a Deputy Director, a Secretary and Project Manager (PimpDro) from LIPI, and the project's
Technical Assistance (TA) team. The key PMO staff will be subject to annual performance reviews. In South
Sulawesi and Maluku, a Provincial Steering Committee coordinated by the Provincial Development Planning
Agency (BAPPEDA Tk. 1), will be responsible for operational guidance, site monitoring, capacity building, and
legal and enforcement support. A District Secretariat chaired by the Regent (13upat,) will coordinate the planning
and implementation of field activities. The evolution of institutional mandates will be monitored closely during
COREMAP I to enable the program to be aligned with the agency most likely to be given a future mandate for
coastal management in Indonesia.
To facilitate program coordination, COREMAP I donors will collaborate in following a common implementation
plan and facilitate reporting requirements.



Page 9
Indonesia: Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project
I'roject Implementation
The PMO Director, assisted by the TA Team Leader, will be responsible for strengthening the COREMAP
program strategy. The PMO Deputy Director will be responsible for the legal framework, assisted by a legal
consultant and experts from LH. The national and regional public awareness campaigns will be contracted out to
a professional public relations (PR) firm. The PMO will remain responsible for dissemination and public relations.
The PMO Director will coordinate the surveillance and enforcement (S&E) component, assisted by specialized
consultants. The project will establish a national coral reef S&E unit at the Directorate General of Fisheries, to
issue guidelines to field units, carry out S&E training, and analyze data. Provincial coral reef S&E units will be
established in South Sulawesi, Maluku, and Irian Jaya at the Provincial Fisheries Offices, reporting to the
F'rovincial Steering Committee.  The units will operate surveillance patrols in collaboration with enforcement
authorities (the Police, the Navy, and, in Taka Bone Rate, the park's Bureau for Forest Protection and
C(onservation), and will coordinate village Reef Watchers, who will be trained to observe and report destructive
cctivities on reefs. All surveillance equipment will be procured centrally by the PMO.
Oualified non-governmental organizations (LSM) and local Universities - the Community Support Group - will
help implement the community-based management component, under a sub-contract to the TA team.  The
groups will deploy a Senior Field Manager working under the Bupati's office, reporting directly to the PMO, and
experienced Field Managers (facilitators) stationed at the target villages. The Field Managers will assist village
organizations such as the Village Development Council (LKMD) and traditional councils in developing and
implementing community-based coral reef management plans. The plans will be assessed by the PMO against
project criteria (Annex 2), triggering the release of village grants in support of management plan implementation,
altemative income generation and infrastructure directly tied to reef management.
Funding Arrangements
LIPI will be the sole executing agency for the project.  Funding from the central government, including loan,
grant, and counterpart funds, will be allocated to LIPI's budget (DIP). All project contracts will be managed by
the PMO following approval by the PMO Director and the Project Manager. Funds for the national coral reef
S&E unit will be channeled by LIPI to the Directorate General of Fisheries based on a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU). Funds to the provinces and districts will be similarly based on an MOU between the
National Steering Committee and the Provincial Committees, and between the National Steering Committee and
the Bupati at the district level. The MOUs will represent a contractual agreement for LIPI to provide project
funding, and for regional governments to implement the agreed outputs. The MOUs will include sufficient details
of the expected work program, as well as the terms and conditions for fund utilization. Disbursement against the
contracts will be phased in stages, based on achievement of work progress and financial reports certified by the
S,enior Field Manager and the PMO. This output based 'contract' is an innovative departure from the standard
input financing to regional govemments (SPABP/lnpres), which will enable greater flexibility in adjusting program
funding to field needs.
Loan and grant funding for surveillance operation and maintenance (at provincial level), as well as for village
funds (at district level) will follow the above mechanism. The loan/grant funds will be authorized by the Ministry
of Finance/Directorate General of Budget (MOF/KPKN) office, following submission of a request for payment by
the Project Manager under GOI's force account payment system (UYHD), whereby GOI funds will be provided
for advance payments to an account controlled by the Bappeda Tk. I chief at the provincial level, and the
EBupati's designated representative at the district level. Based on work progress and financial reports, the
accounts will be replenished through reimbursement from the loan and grant special accounts at Bank
Indonesia. Village grants will be similarly advanced by GOI and reimbursed from the loan's special account.
Compliance with the agreed village grant criteria will be first certified by the Senior Field Manager and verified by
the PMO. The Project Manager will then authorize disbursement of the funds to a district account earmarked for
al direct cash transfer to the LKMD. A first payment of up to 30 percent of the village grants will be made upon the
production of a draft reef management plan and/or altemative income generation plan meeting project
gluidelines. Other payments will be released to the LKMD based on achievement of subsequent benchmarks,
satisfactory work progress, and accountability reports on the use of the funds. The fund transfers will be verified
by the Senior Field Managers at the district level, and the Field Managers at the village level.

Accounting, Reporting, and Auditing
The project accounting, financial reporting and auditing will be done in accordance to standards acceptable to
the Bank (Annex 6).  Annual project plans will be prepared prior to the conclusion of each calendar year.
Project accounting will follow GOI's accounting system, in line with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP). Financial statements will include a project account report prepared by the PMO in accordance with the
format specified in the Project Implementation Plan, and a special account/statement of expenditures report
prepared by the Directorate General of Budget.  The PMO, provincial and district offices and LKMD will
establish and maintain separate accounts. At the village level, the LKMD and assigned Field Manager will keep
a record of all village grants' financial transactions in a blackboard or accounting book placed in a central
location, accessible to project staff and interested community members. A progress and financial report will be
prepared quarterly. At the district level, the Bupati's representative, with the assistance from the Senior Field
Manager, will consolidate the LKMD reports with other district-level expenditures on a quarterly basis. The
provincial project units will similarly prepare quarterly reports for expendiitures incurred at the provincial level.
The PMO's project manager will consolidate these reports with national-level expenditures, and submit the
consolidated project report to the Bank quarterly. Project accounts, including Statement of Expenditures (SOEs)
and Special Accounts will be audited annually by the Central Audit 13ureau (BPKP) in accordance with
procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Copies of the annual financial statements, audited reports, and progress
reports will be fumished to the Bank within six months of the end of the! fiscal year. The format for MOUs,
progress and financial reports, and criteria for disbursement to the field have been agreed with the Bank and the
system will be ready for implementation by the time of project effectiveness.
Monitoring and Evaluation
Bank supervision missions will monitor compliance with the agreed project indicators. A mid-term review will be
fielded during the second year of implementation to assess progress and allow for necessary corrections in
adaptable program processing. An independent evaluation will be conducl:ed during the last year of the project
to evaluate lessons of experience and determine readiness for COREMAP 11 (Annex 2). The COREMAP donors
will collaborate closely during these benchmark reviews. Lessons of experience will be assimilated in future
program design and disseminated to COREMAP program sites, as well as to intemational fora such as the
Intemational Coral Reef Initiative and the Year 2000 Coral Reef Symposium.
D: Project Rationale
1. ProJect altematves considered and reasons for rejecton:
Scope: The project was initially designed to support site management in five Eastem Indonesia provinces, using
a conventional, 5-year project cycle. ADB was to finance a parallel project in five additional provinces. This
scope was considered too ambitious in the absence of a national framework to support community-based reef
management. A 15 year, three-phase program, enabling field activities to be gradually expanded as lessons of
experience emerged, was therefore selected.
Executing Agencies: The project considered the option of multiple executing agencies. A unified financing
mechanism, executed by LIPI and managed by a strong PMO, was considered preferable to ensure delivery
durng the project's short implementation period. Similarly, an output based MOU with regional govemments
was deemed preferable to SPABP financing, due to greater flexibility and output accountability.
Sedimentation Issues. The project team considered addressing large-scale sedimentation problems but these
were not found to be an issue at the project sites. Hence, a threat minimization approach was adopted as the
appropriate strategy to deal with the acute threats affecting the sites. It was agreed that COREMAP I would
address sedimentation insofar as it is pertinent to the project sites, and amenable to local control (e.g. mangrove
restoration). This issue will be revisited for COREMAP 11 sites.

3. Lessons leamed and reflected in the project design:
COREMAP will be the first Bank project specifically devoted to coral reef management. However, the Bank has
supported more than 50 projects and programs worldwide with a marine and coastal focus. Most operations are
too recent to extract lessons of experience. The Philippines Central Visayas Regional Project, closed in 1992,
included a CBM component which established small reef sanctuaries. The Project Completion Report (PH-2360)
concluded that (i) CBM was effective in increasing coastal fishers' productivity and income; but that (ii)
sustainability was doubtful without legal means to control access to resources.  Subsequent initiatives have
acldressed some of the early shortfalls, and the project is now considered a model for other local initiatives. The
Seychelles Biodiversity Conservation and Marine Pollution Abatement Project (SC-GE-2377), started in 1993,
has successfully changed exploitation patterns for a traditionally hunted resource (sea turtles) that was rapidly
becoming extinct, through a combination of public awareness and legislation.
Lessons of experience from similar programs in the region indicate that:
* Habitat management in the form of reef sanctuaries (no-take zones), allowing regeneration of fishery
resources to surrounding areas where fishing pressure is regulated, is generally more effective than
management aimed at specific stocks.  All reef fishery management regimes, however, require a
replacement of open access conditions by limited access or catch control.
* Reef management has been most successful where communities have been organized and empowered to
manage local reef resources.  Local govemment endorsement of management plans and recognition of
community user rights is essential to ensure the sustainability of CBM initiatives.



Page 12
Indonesia: Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project
* Many CBM initiatives have failed because of inadequate attention to powerful extemal threats. These need
to be addressed through effective enforcement and coordinated site development plans.
*  Reef management systems should be kept flexible and adaptable, buillding upon local ecological knowledge
and traditional management systems;
* Local support should be established first for a limited set of clear and' achievable goals of direct interest to
local people. Early success in achieving these goals helps build capacity to address more complex issues,
such as land-based threats.
*  Reef management has been most successful when local stakeholders derive quick and direct economic
benefits from reef management, such as improved fisheries productivity or tourism spin-off benefits.
Altemative income generation needs to be closely tied with management goals, and should be
complemented by awareness programs, training in non-destructive practices, improvements in local access
to credit, and establishment of private sector links.
* Reef monitoring systems should be introduced from the outset to permit an early evaluation of impact, and a
rapid adjustment of management rules.
These lessons have been incorporated into project design. The stronger focus on legal framework, enforcement,
and a slower phasing of site management reflect the recommendations of project reviewers, including a Scientific
and Technical Advisory Panel expert review at the project concept document (July 21, 1997) and GEF Council
submission (May 1, 1997) stages.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
GOI is highly committed to the COREMAP initiative. To date, it has allocated an equivalent of US$8 million to
activities related to COREMAP's preparation. GOI has funded extensive scocio-economic and ecological surveys
in priority program sites, and managed the technical assistance for project preparation. GOI has also
established an inter-agency preparation team in February 1995 and, mIore recently, a national COREMAP
Steering Committee.  Working groups were established in all ten program provinces in 1996, including
representatives from various agencies, Universities and local non-govemmental organizations. In recognition of
the need to strengthen project guidelines and finalize preparation, GOI allocated US$4.7 million equivalent in
counterpart funds for pre-implementation activities during fiscal year 1997-98. These have funded a new
COREMAP building, the drafting of program guidelines, pilot field facilitators.' training, and stock assessment.
S. Value added of Bank and Global support in this project:
The donors' roles in the COREMAP program have been carefully considered to take into account their
comparative advantages. The Bank and GEF are well positioned to support the COREMAP's strategy: the
Bank was one of the key agencies launching the 1995 Global Representative System of Marine Protected Areas
(MPAs), which identified world-wide priorities for MPA interventions. The Bank's Marine Market Transformation
Initiative (MMTI) is collaborating with extemal partners in finding solutions for the live reef fish trade in East Asia
and Pacific, one of the most important threats to Indonesia's reefs. The Bank has also recently sponsored two
Coral Reef Conferences which helped bring together best practices and lessons of experience from coral reef
management around the world. The 1996 Economic Analysis of Indonesian Coral Reefs, completed as part of
the project preparation, has been disseminated widely and is expected to become an important tool for policy
dialogue in Indonesia. The Bank has also, since 1990, assisted GOI in strengthening its environmental
protection capacity. These efforts have contributed to the establishment of provincial pollution control agencies
(BAPEDALDA), and to a new national law on environmental management. COREMAP is further expected to
benefit from the Bank's involvement in regional development in Sulawesi and Maluku.
GEF's support will help raise visibility and global support for the management of the most biologically important
coral reef ecosystems in the world. GEF funding will also help ensure that areas of global biodiversity
importance, which may be isolated and of limited priority to regional govemments, are included in the
COREMAP program strategy.

COREMAP program benefits will arise primarily from removal of threats to the reefs, in particular poison fishing,
explosives fishing, coral mining, overfishing, and sedimentation. While these unsustainable practices can yield
large benefits to individuals, they impose high costs to Indonesia in the form of lost fisheries productivity, tourism
value, and coastal protection. The net impact of these practices is summarized as follows (see Annex 4.1):
Threats to Reefs         Benefits to Individuals  Costs to Society         Net costs to Soclety'
Poison Fishing                     33                     43-476                   10-443

" Present value, 10% discount rate, 25 year time-span in US$'000 per km' of reef. The range in value takes into account vaiations in
bounsm potential and coastal protecion across sites. See Cesar (1996) 'Economic Analysis of Indonesian Coral Reefs'.
A detailed economic analysis was carried out for the two project sites, taking into consideration existing threats,
coral reef condition, fishing practices, and tourism and coastal protection values (Annex 4.1). For Taka Bone
Rate, the estimated quantifiable ERR is 14 percent, with an NPV of US$5 million over 25 years. For the Lease
Island site, the estimated ERR is 15 percent (NPV US$0.8 million). A sensitivity analysis, taking into account
the extreme possibility that the sites will require a doubling in enforcement costs after COREMAP I, resulted in
an ERR for Taka Bone Rate of 12 percent, and for Lease Islands of 11 percent. The relatively low ERR takes
into account the higher site support costs required for COREMAP I, expected to decrease during Phase II as
final program guidelines become available. A sensitivity analysis performed on the Lease Island site assuming
an extreme (75 percent) devaluation of the Rupiah from February 1998 levels results in an ERR of 19 percent,
confirming the continuing viability of the project under deteriorating economic conditions.
The benefits of national components such as the COREMAP program policy. legal framework, and public
;awareness campaigns, while not directly quantifiable, are judged to be substantial. In Indonesia, the benefits of
reducing fishing pressure from an open access situation to opfimal management are esfimated at US$70,000 in
net present value per km2 of reef. In Palau, the success of marine protected management is attributed largely to
a well directed public awareness campaign.   The national surveillance and enforcement sub-component is
esxpected to include an action plan to address mobile threats (particularly poison fishing), which would be
implemented during COREMAP II or by parallel Government programs. The estimated net benefit of replacing
large-scale poison fishing in Indonesia by sustainable alternatives is US$370 million.
1.b. Incremental Costs
The incremental costs associated with global benefits are estimated at US$11.6 million for the COREMAP
program, of which US$4.1 million represents the costs for COREMAP I (see below). The detailed incremental
cost analysis for the program is presented in Annex 4.2.

The baseline scenario would target the rational use of Indonesian coral reef resources according to national
development goals.  It would also lead to greater institutional capacity and general public awareness. The
baseline scenario would, however, be insufficient to ensure that sites of high biodiversity importance (such as
Taka Bone Rate National Park) are included in the COREMAP program strategy, since these areas are often of
limited regional development priority. The GEF altemative will help develop an effective surveillance system in
Taka Bone Rate to protect the park from extemal threats, improve public participation and involvement of non-
govemmental stakeholders in field activities, strengthen the legal framework in support of traditional user rights,
and support awareness campaigns likely to benefit coral reef protection throughout Indonesia.
2. Financial (see Annex 5): NPV=US$21,600 (per village package); FRR= 39%
Village Micro-Enterprise Viability
A detailed financial analysis was carried out for altemative income generation micro-enterprises likely to be
supported under the project. The financial analysis estimated requirements for (i) capital investment and
working capital; (ii) profit and loss statement; and (iv) financial planning cash flow. The financial rates of return
range from 28 to 59 percent, with 39 percent for a representative package of micro-enterprise investments.
When risk factors over and beyond normal business risk were added, the switching values - the values for
which the FRR equals the opportunity cost of capital - were obtained at a 15 percent decrease in revenues and
at a 70 percent increase in investment costs.

Provided that user rights and reef management regimes can be effectively e,nforced, reef management can yield
benefits relatively quickly through increased fisheries productivity (see Technical Analysis). Reef sanctuaries
can typically benefit surrounding fishing areas within a period of 3-7 years.  The financial rate of return for
average reef sanctuaries in the Philippines is 28 percent, indicating that reicurrent expenditures are more than
offset by management benefits. Nonetheless, reef sanctuaries result in closures of 20-30 percent of the reef
area, imposing short-term costs to traditional fishers. In Taka Bone Rate, these losses are estimated at an
equivalent of US$28,000 per village over a period of two years, using conservative assumptions of reef recovery
(see Annex 5). Hence, an initial subsidy equivalent to US$25-30,000 per village for altemative income
generation and reef-caring infrastructure, as determined by the project, is considered justified.
Fiscal Impact
GOI will finance approximately US$1.8 million of total project costs, primarily for project management,
surveillance operation and maintenance, local govemment support, and taxes. Most of GOI's contribution will be
in the form of central Govemment expenditures and thus is not expected to result in a significant fiscal impact
due to the small project size.  Should there be an extreme devaluation of the currency -75 percent from the
negotiation period estimates-, GOI and the Bank would consider, at mid-term review, whether to cancel the
unutilized funds or to re-allocate them to incremental project outputs. The savings under this scenario would
amount to US$1.7 million in loan funds and US$0.9 million in grant funds.
3. Technical:
The impact of closures in replenishing fish populations is well documented. There is increasing evidence that
this type of habitat management is preferable to species-specific management in tropical areas, given species
interactions. Closed areas (permanent no-take sanctuaries) are also easier to enforce than effort or quota
regulations. Reef sanctuaries help replenish adjacent fishing areas in two ways: first, by increasing larvae
3
survival; and second, by serving as reservoirs for fish straying into surrounding areas . This replenishment
effect is believed to take 3 to 7 years. The use of sanctuaries for fisheries replenishment is enhanced by a
system of relatively small, inter-connected protected areas, comprising approximately 20 to 30 percent of the
reefs. These areas should protect spawning sites and be accompanied by limited entry on surrounding fishing
grounds. For biodiversity protection purposes, much larger protected areas are recommended to accommodate
the range of target conservation species. These principles will be taken into consideration by the COREMAP
program.

Indonesia: Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project
The project will rely on natural regeneration of coral reef areas. Artificial replenishment, including artificial reefs
and coral transplantation, will in principle not be supported given their controversial value as habitat enhancers.
Restocking programs, similarly, will only be considered once management regimes are firmly in place.
Alternative income generating activities will be screened to ensure that technologies are commercially viable,
have a developed market, and are ecologically sound. Experimental and risky mariculture such as sea
cLicumber and grouper culture would therefore not be encouraged at the village level until the technology
becomes established.
4. Institutional:
Executing agency:  LIPI has executed two project preparation grants, and has therefore experience with the
Bank's consultant contract guidelines.  There were concerns that the LIPI project manager may be over-
burdened with procurement requirements during implementation, particularly given the short duration of the
project, and parallel COREMAP initiatives funded by other donors. GOI has addressed some of these concems
by ensuring that contracting will be assigned to experienced PMO staff, and that advanced action is taken on
technical assistance mobilization.
Project management: COREMAP working groups at the central and provincial levels have been actively
involved in project design. Coordination problems were experienced during preparation due to a weak flow of
inlformation between the large number of stakeholders involved. This weakness has been recognized and will
be addressed by the project through (i) concentrating project management responsibilities into one centrally
managed unit (PMO), staffed by highly qualified, full-time secondments; (ii) deploying a Senior Field Manager at
the district level, responsible for linking field activities with the PMO; and (iii) installing INTERNET communicafion
in all regional offices. Project components requiring specialized knowledge (e.g. surveillance and awareness)
will be assisted by extemal consultants.
The capacity of the Directorate General of Fisheries (DGF) in surveillance remains untested and will be piloted
during the project. However, DGF is currently conducting an extensive upgrading program for enforcement
officers, and will benefit from a new monitoring, control and surveillance system supported under ADB's Coastal
Communities Development and Fisheries Resources Conservation Project  The district govemments have
weak capacity to support COREMAP activities. However, as the future focus of the national program, they will
need to be involved from its early stages. It is expected that much of the CBM site support during COREMAP I
will be provided by LSM/University groups. Competent LSMs are already active at both project sites, and they
should be able to provide the required support with limited TA assistance in specialized areas. The capacity of
viflages to implement reef management plans will be tested during COREMAP 1. An on-going LSM program is
assisting villages at the Lease Island site in strengthening traditional management, and provided that customary
leaders are effectively involved, no significant capacity problems are envisaged. Taka Bone Rate communities
lack coastal management traditions and are subject to a higher incidence of external threats. Their capacity to
manage reef resources will be tested through adaptable management and a careful phasing of project
interventions.
5. Social:
The major social issues faced by the project include:
* Break-down in customary community resources management systems due to lack of user rights' recognition;
* Destructive practices such as reef bombing, due to limited economic opportunities in remote sites;
* Dependence on traders and middlemen for marketing of products;
* Limited capacity of local communities to enforce user rights against external fishers;
* Limited capacity of village institutions such as LKMDs to manage and implement field activities;
*  Intemal conflict within and between neighboring communities on access to limited reef resources.
* Ethnic and cultural heterogeneity among resident fishing populations in Taka Bone Rate (Buginese and
Bajau communities);



Page 16
Indonesia: Coral Reef Rehabilitaton and Managemeint Project
Each of these issues will be addressed directly by the project design: the project will evaluate local regulations in
Maluku in support of local community user rights over reef resources.   Poverty will be addressed through
community-based fisheries management aimed at restoring the productive potential of coral reefs. The project
will also assist poor fishers involved in destructive activities in achieving more sustainable income through
altemative micro-enterprises. Community preparation activities will include strengthening village groups,
improving access to credit, and strengthening terms of trade with existing middlemen. The project will support a
major surveillance and enforcement component to curb extemal threats. Field facilitators will work with both
formal (LKMD) and informal organizations (adat, fishers', and women's groups) to help strengthen their
institutional capacity. The Bupatis and the Community Support Group will play a key role in resolving inter-
community user conflicts. The project will also help strengthen traditional inter-village councils (Latupatr) at the
Lease Island site in Maluku. Considerable investment has gone into social analysis and data collection to ensure
development of culturally appropriate management plans. This will be! further ensured by the use of LSMs
familiar with local cultural practices.
Gender Issues - Women in target project communities play a key role in processing fish, marketing products,
and reef gleaning. The project will directly assist women through tairgeted micro-enterprise development,
improved access to credit, and gender sensitive activities. Women groups will be one of three key community
groups targeted under the CBM component (see Annex 2). The project may affect women as it may restrict
collection of certain types of invertebrates and destructive reef gleaning - however, this decision would be taken
jointly by the community as part of local reef management plans, and the possible loss of income and food would
be directly compensated by the higher income obtained from reef recovery and altemative income sources.
Borrower's Commitment - GOI has demonstrated considerable commitment towards social issues by (a)
financing the Social Assessment entirely from counterpart funds; (b) contracting LSMs to assist with project
preparation; and (c) recognizing community empowerment as a vital element of the COREMAP strategy.
Other Social Issues - At present there are no resettlement issues envisaged at the two project sites.
Resettlement may become an issue in COREMAP II as the program expands to new sites, particularly in areas
where future private sector tourism development may lead to land acquisilion and resettlement (Irian, Maluku) or
where expansion of mining activities may lead to displacement of coastal communities (Lease Islands, Maluku).
This would be addressed during the design of COREMAP II.
The Bank's policy on isolated vulnerable people will apply to the project sites. Since the project has integrated
the strengthening of community rights to local resources, and improved development benefits through income-
generation activities, there will be no need for a separate isolated cornmunities' action plan. The issue of
nomadic fishermen such as the Bajau is difficult to address as their access to fishing rights could decrease
through the implementation of local management plans. In Taka Bone Rate, however, traditional fishers are
allowed to operate in the park outside strict conservation areas, and provided these rules are adhered to during
project implementation, no major adverse impact is expected. Possible user conflicts between Bajau and
Buginese fishers would be addressed through the proposed conflict resolution mechanism outlined in Annex
12.3, and through special mitigation measures to ensure that Bajau communities become direct beneficiaries of
reef management and altemative livelihood.
6. Environmental assessment      Environmental Category [] A   [x] B   [] C
With the possible exception of micro-enterprises supported under the CEIM component, the project would not
have any adverse environmental impacts. An extensive reef monitoring system, capable of detecting changes in
coral environmental conditions, will be put in place in all COREMAP I sites under separate ADB financing.
Community proposals will be specifically screened to exclude any activitieis that may adversely affect the reefs
by causing physical disturbance in coral communities, turbidity or sedimentation, or untreated discharge of
pollutants. Eco-tourism activities will be assessed based on the sites' carrying capacity.
Of much greater concem is the possibility that the project may lose its benefits through non-COREMAP activities

undertaken by public and private agencies. This could include expansion of mining exploration concessions into
Saparua (Lease Island site), and a possible live fish export center and oil refinery in Selayar, South Sulawesi. To
minimize this risk, BAPPENAS and BAPPEDA Tk. I will closely monitor proposed investment planning and
changes in land use in project areas, to minimize the potential for conflicts with project objectives. Where such
conflict may exist, COREMAP will rely on environmental impact (AMDAL) regulations requiring a full
environmental assessment (ANDAL) for any activity in, adjoining, or changing the characteristics of a coral reef
area. The Chairmen of BAPPEDA Tk. I in South Sulawesi and Central Maluku will ensure that (i) the ANDAL
terms of reference, reports and management and monitoring plans satisfactorily address the potential impacts on
COREMAP sites, using appropriate quantitative techniques; (ii) LSMs and representatives of affected
communities participate in the provincial AMDAL commissions' (KOMDA) meetings; and that (iii) other members
of the provincial Steering Committee, National Secretariat, and PMO are consulted during the review process.
The Bank would be given an opportunity to review copies of the ANDAL terms of reference and reports before
they are finalized and would provide technical advice for use by the National Secretariat and/or Provincial
Steering Committees in their reviews. The above procedure has been agreed during project negotiations.

F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustalnability
COREMAP Program. Program sustainability would be a specific focus of COREMAP Ill. By the conclusion of
that phase, it is expected that program financing would be ensured through specific block grant transfers from
the central govemment earmarked for environmental management. Most expenditures during the post-program
phase would be recurrent (see Annex 5).
COREMAP I Project. The legal and policy reforms introduced by the project - particularly the strengthening of
user rights, and legislation on poison and explosives fishing - are expected to provide incentives for future
behavioral change, with little requirements for follow-up financing. Similarly, reef management interventions can
pay off for themselves in the form of higher fisheries and tourism value, provided there is compliance with
management rules.   Surveillance and enforcement operations will constitute by far the largest follow-up
expenditure at the site level. This funding will need to be provided by the Indonesian Government in perpetuity,
as part of its sovereign duties over archipelagic waters, and is expected to decline as a more effective vessel
registration and monitoring system is put in place, complemented by market incentives such as poison testing
and certification. These interventions will be addressed in stages by subsequent COREMAP projects.

2. Critical Risks (reflecting assumptions in the fourth column of Annex 1):
Because of its innovative and experimental nature, the project will involve significant risks. However, these will
be balanced by the potential high benefits of establishing an effective framework for managing coral reefs in
Indonesia. The project small size (US$12.8 million) and adaptable program framework reflect a 'leaming by
doing' strategy designed to manage potential risks.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects
In Taka Bone Rate, the project will test a combination of deterrent and preventive surveillance. The area is now
the focus of extensive extemal fishing, originating from as far away as F lores, Southeast Sulawesi and Ujung
Pandang. Much of this extemal fishing, involving poison and explosives, iis illegal. For legal fishers, the rules of
entry into the park remain unclear in the current park management plan, and require further clarification before
an effective enforcement system can be introduced. The project will use Et conflict resolution framework such as
outlined on Annex 12.3 to manage potential conflicts between fishing groups, and between these groups and the
park. Aerial surveillance over Taka Bone Rate is also expected to ease the possibility of on-the-ground conflicts.
Another potential controversial issue is the reported abuses of authority and rent seeking behavior currently
reported in Taka. The introduction of joint patrols with civilian agencies working side by side with enforcement
authorities, and a background checking system to determine the effectiveness of actions taken in response to
violation reports are expected to improve the transparency of surveillance operations.

Indonesia: Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project
At present, the only known planes equipped to provide aerial surveillance over Taka Bone Rate are the NOMAD
aircraft of the Indonesian Navy in Ujung Pandang.  These costs, expected to include primarily fuel and air
maintenance costs, will be covered by counterpart financing. Conflicts over resource use are not expected to be
as pronounced in the Lease Island site, due to strong customary rights' traditions.
G: Main Loan and Grant Conditions
1. Board Conditions:

Annex 2
Indonesia: Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project
Detailed Project Description
Project Component I - Program Strategy and Management (US$2.9 million)
The Program Strategy and Management Component will lay the foundation for the COREMAP program.
It will produce (i) the policy and strategic framework for the program; (ii) a strengthened legal framework
for coral reef management in Indonesia; (iii) project management, and assessment of lessons leamed;
and (iv) an independent evaluation of COREMAP I and preparation for COREMAP II.
Sub-Component 1.1: National COREMAP Program Strategy (US$0.7million)
The project will fund technical assistance and discussion workshops to strengthen the national policy for
coral reef management, and finalize the strategy, operational guidelines and action plan for the
COREMAP program. This consolidated program strategy will be discussed with key stakeholders during
its development, including government, non-government and private sector representatives. The final
strategy will be presented to the COREMAP Steering Committee for approval during the third year of
implementation and will receive a Ministerial recommendation from BAPPENAS:

Discussion at Stakeholder Fora
Final Program Policy, Strategy, and Action Plan
Endorsement by Steering Committee
Ministerial Recommendation
The key elements of the COREMAP program strategy will include:
* A strengthened national policy for coral reef protectUon and its sustainable use, specifying the
rationale for the policy, general policy statements and measures to be adopted, and implications
for future national development. The policy will help consolidate and update key aspects of LH's
1992 National Coral Reef Strategy, as well as the 1996 Indonesia's Marine Environmental Policy.



-26-
* A natonal COREMAP program strategy, including guidelines for program support. The strategy
will clearly specify the (i) the national commitment to the program, (ii) its goal and objectives, (iii)
the operational and institutional framework, (iv) criteria fcr site prioritization; (v) criteria for
stakeholder involvement, (vi) and operational guidelines for program implementation.   Strategy
development will be iterative, building upon lessons of experience from the Initiation Phase. The
strategy will also strengthen the program's site selection in accordance with emerging information
on the status of coral reefs in Indonesia.
* Short-term (5 years) and long-term (25 years) action plan for the COREMAP program clearly
specifying priority objectives, actions, geographical focus, and expected performance benchmarks.
Responsibility: PMO Director and Deputy Director, assisted by the TA Team Leader.
Sub-Component 1.2: Legal Framework for Coral Reef Management (US$0.3 million)
The legal framework sub-component will help draft new regulations and improve and clarify key existing
regulations affecting reef management in Indonesia. The project will supply technical assistance, studies
and workshops in support of the following activities:
* Review and rationalizaton of key national legislation affecting coral reefs. This will be done
through both proposed new legislation, as well as interpretation of existing laws. The review will focus
on legal measures to control destructive practices on reefs, namely by drafting regulations prohibiting
the transportation and use of explosives or poisonous substances aboard vessels, as well as the
possession of illegally caught fish. Other regulations in support of the enforcement component, such
as a possible ban on scuba or hookah gear in protected areas, could also be considered. The review
will also help harmonize the definitions and contents of key laws (e.g. National Fisheries Law No. 9,
1985 and Conservation Law of Ministry of Forestry No. 5, 1990) to provide for their consistent
interpretation.    Finally, the review will investigate how existing laws (e.g. Law No. 5 of 1960 on
Basic Provisions for Agrarian Law, Law No. 5 1990 on National Resources Conservation of Flora and
Fauna, Law No. 24, 1992 on Spatial Planning, Law No. 5, 1996 on Indonesian Territorial Waters, and
Law No. 23, 1997 on Environmental Management) could be used in support of reef management.
* Strengthened legal framework for community-based management and marine protected areas.
This will include (i) provision of assistance to the Maluku regional govemment in evaluating and
preparing draft regional regulations (PerDa) on coral reefs, particularly on customary user rights, and
taking into account local cultural assets; (ii) assisting the district governments at project sites in
issuing Letters of Endorsement (Surat Keputusan Bupati or PerDa) to community-based reef
management plans; and (iii) drafting and discussing the legal, managerial responsibilities and fiscal
framework for a conservation management authority for Taka Bone Rate.
* Legal Studies. The project will investigate the type of evidence admissible in court to prove major
destructive practices to coral reefs, and translate it into guidelines for collection of evidence to be
used as a basis for surveillance training.  Additional legal stu(dies, in particular a study on legal
aspects of conflict resolution, could also be financed if required for the legal framework development.
Responsibility:   The legal framework will be the responsibility of the PMO Deputy Director and
LH/BAPEDAL staff seconded to the PMO, assisted by a long-term legal consultant. The key output will
be a matrix of proposed draft legislation, submitted to the relevant institutions for enactment. Guidelines
for Surat Keputusan, PerDa, clarification of existing legislation, and collection of evidence will be
disseminated through the public awareness component, and their key elements incorporated into the
COREMAP program guidelines.
Sub-Component 1.3: Project Management (US$1.2 million)
The project will fund office and field equipment, workshops, incremental staff, travel, and general
operation and maintenance for the PMO and regional project units. Ulnder this sub-component, the PMO



-27-
will (i) assign and mobilize key counterpart staff; (ii) manage all procurement contracts; (iii) conduct the
project launch, and project planning, review, and evaluation workshops; (iv) prepare project accounts and
reports; (v) conduct workshops for field facilitators and regional project staff, (vi) carry out comparative
studies; and (vi) coordinate all project activities.    The PMO will also ensure the dissemination of
emerging lessons of experience across COREMAP sites.
Capacity building and institutional strengthening is expected to be funded separately by AusAID. The
project will, however, include a small budget for training and cross visits at the provincial level. In South
Sulawesi, this will include a pilot radio open education program aimed at highly mobile fishing
communities, as well as training directly related to site support. The training in Maluku will involve
primarily site support and cross visits. With the exception of major workshops, project management
activities will be financed by counterpart funds.
Sub-Component 1.4: Evaluation of COREMAP I and Preparation for COREMAP 11 (US$0.7 million)
Independent COREMAP I evaluation: In addition to routine evaluations, the project will commission,
six months prior to completion, an independent evaluation of COREMAP I. The evaluation will assess
progress in achieving the benchmark indicators for the Initiation Phase (Annex 14.1.a), and recommend
future program adjustments. It will be carried out by an independent panel of highly qualified experts, of
which half will be nominated by GOI (and approved by the Bank, in consultation with other COREMAP
donors), and half by the World Bank Environmental Sector Board (approved by GOI).  The World
Conservation Union (IUCN) would be selected to manage the panel, and would be able to comment on
its; composition. The independent panel will discuss their findings with the COREMAP Secretariat prior
to the conclusion of the evaluation. Their unedited opinion, together with GOI's own evaluation, will be
furnished to the Bank within 30 days of the assignment.  The terms of reference for the independent
panel will be defined with GOI at mid-term review.
P-reparation for COREMAP 11: The project will allocate incremental technical assistance to complete the
design of COREMAP II and prepare a draft a Project Implementation Plan in accordance with GOI,
World Bank and GEF requirements. Subject to a satisfactory independent evaluation of Phase I, the
W'orld Bank and GEF would support the management of priority coral reef sites in South Sulawesi,
Southeast Sulawesi, Maluku and Irian Jaya during COREMAP II (see Annex 14.2). Detailed ecological
and social assessments for these sites will be carried out by the Coral Reef Information and Training
Centers (CRITCs) under separate ADB financing.
Project Component 2 - Public Awareness (US$3.9 million)
The main purpose of this component will be to educate the public on the nature of coral reef threats,
foster public stewardship towards Indonesia's reefs, and change destructive behavior. The overall
principle will be to have a single national COREMAP awareness strategy, with a consistent message
across all COREMAP provinces and sites. The project will provide services, workshops, publications,
awareness materials, surveys, and awards in support of (i) a national multi-media awareness campaign;
(ii) regional campaigns in COREMAP I pilot provinces; and (iii) public relations and dissemination of
program guidelines. Target audiences will include reef users (primary), development planners, decision
miakers, local leaders, NGOs and school children (see Table below).
Rlesponsibilities: National and regional campaigns will be carried out by a highly qualified public
relations media firm familiar with the Indonesian setting, under contract to the PMO. The firm will enlist
the support of NGOs and local groups and help build their capacity in regional campaign implementation.
The PMO, assisted by a seconded staff from the Directorate General of Tourism, will be responsible for
dissemination and public relations.  A limited number of awareness activities are expected to be
implemented by the provincial project units, in collaboration with LSMs (see Component 2.2).

An independent social marketing research survey will be commissioned to evaluate the results of the
campaign, prior to and after its implementation. The results will be used by the PR firm to optimize the
use of the various media during the campaign.
Component 2.2: Regional Awareness Campaigns (US$0.7 million)
Regional Awareness Campaigns will be implemented in the four pilot COREMAP I provinces (South
Sulawesi, Maluku, Riau and East Nusa Tenggara). Activities to be supported will include:
*  Children competition for COREMAP logo design.
* Billboards promoting coral reef conservation.
*  Radio production, spots and programs in local stations.

Sub-Component 2.3: Public Relations and Dissemination (US$0.2 million)
T he sub-component will fund:
* COREMAP program disseminaton including distribution of COREMAP program guidelines to
relevant COREMAP stakeholders in all ten program provinces, comparative studies, and regular
updating (3 times a year) of the COREMAP's newsletter and Web site. The PR firm will also ensure
that awareness materials are made available to NGOs, schools and other education institutions.
* Public relations, including national workshops and lobbying of decision makers, production of press
briefs, press conferences, consultations, and awareness material distribution at public events.
e Public awards, including a national Reef Watchers' day, national competition for best managed
COREMAP site, writing contests and awards to journalists, and development of other competitive
awards rewarding outstanding performance by villages, groups, or individuals in reef conservation.
Project Component 3 - Surveillance and Enforcement (US$4.0 million)
The purpose of this component will be to curb destructive practices on coral reefs. The project will fund
specialized technical assistance, surveillance equipment, studies, surveillance operations, workshops,
and incremental staff costs in support of (i) a national surveillance and enforcement (S&E) unit (ii) S&E
operations at target project sites; and (iii) surveillance training.



-30-
Destructive fishing practices - primarily explosives and poison - originate from two sources: (i) well
organized, powerful fishing cartels; and (ii) resident and transient fishers. The first source includes
foreign vessels fishing illegally in Indonesia as well as highly mobile domestic vessels, frequently
targeting remote reefs. The second, small-scale group often recognizes their impact on traditional fishing
grounds, but is driven to destructive practices by economic necessity and increasing resource scarcity.
The project will develop distinct strategies to deal with these groups:
* Large-scale pressures: The proposed strategy involves a combination of legislative reform, and
full deterrent enforcement.  First, the project will help draft leigislation shifting the burden of proof
from fishers to middlemen encouraging illegal practices (see Sub-Component 1.2). Second, the
project will support a study on poison testing and certification followed, if sufficient progress is
achieved on the legal front, by a pilot certification scheme. Finally, the project will strengthen the
capacity and effectiveness of deterrent enforcement by piloting a rapid response system,
encouraging joint patrols between local govemment and enforcement agencies, and developing
checks and balances in violations' recording.
* Small-scale, resident pressures: The proposed strategy involves a combination of awareness,
community-based management, and alternative income generation.  The project will stress
preventive enforcement, through a village Reef Watch program linked to promotion of community
stewardship towards the reefs.
Responsibilities:   The PMO Director will have overall responsibility for the component.   The
Directorate General of Fisheries (DGF) will be the component's implementing agency. DGF will
establish a national unit to operate a coral reef enforcement and surveillance system (National Coral Reef
S&E Unit), working in close collaboration with the Ministry of Environment (LH) and DKN, for policy
coordination, and the Navy, Police, and Department of Sea Communications, for enforcement operations.
At the site level, Provincial Coral Reef S&E Units will be coordinated by the Provincial Fisheries
Agencies (Dinas Perikanan), under guidance from and reporting to the COREMAP Steering Committee.
Joint patrols will be organized by Dinas Perikanan with the local conservation unit (SBKSDA) and
enforcement authorities (KAMLA). The units will also be responsible for the Reef Watch program at the
site level, in close collaboration with the community support group assisting the CBM component.
Sub-Component 3.1: National Surveillance and Enforcement Component (US$1.0 million)
This sub-component will include the following activities:
* Development of an operational manual for field surveillance and enforcement operations,
including a description of each site's operational system, equipment requirements, detailed guidelines
and standards for patrolling, reporting, recording, monitoring and evaluation, staffing, and training
proposed. The manual will take into account field conditions to ensure the flexibility and efficiency of
surveillance operations.  It will be adjusted at the end of COREMAP I based on lessons of
experience from the field pilots, and incorporated into the final COREMAP program guidelines.
* Procurement and distribution of surveillance equipment Based on the pilot site requirements,
the technical assistance will help the PMO procure and distribute surveillance equipment to the S&E
units (sub-component 3.2). Patrol vessel specifications will vary from site to site, depending on the
capability of commercial vessels and sea conditions. Communication equipment will be standardized
across all S&E units. The project could also help pilot relevant new surveillance equipment, such as
underwater recorders for blast fishing.
* Establishment of a National Coral Reef S&E Unit, to operate a surveillance and enforcement
system for the project. The unit will be responsible for daita information collection, analysis,
interpretation and dissemination; support to field units; and monitoring and evaluation of field
activities. The unit will be closely linked to DGF's MCS system, developed under the ADB Coastal
Community Development and Fisheries Management Project.
* Special Workshops. The project will support workshops for judges, policy makers, prosecutors and
senior enforcement officials, and national and international workshops on coral reef protection from



- 31 -
destructive activities. The workshops would discuss issues of concern, actions to be taken, and
lessons learned in curbing destructive activities in coral reef areas.
* Poison Testing Study. This study will develop an action plan to introduce poison testing in
Indonesia. Provided legislation is enacted outlawing the use of cyanide in tranquilization, the project
could initiate a pilot test and certification scheme in Taka Bone Rate. Full-scale testing and
certification could be considered during COREMAP 11.
Sub-Component 3.2: Site Surveillance and Enforcement (US$2.7 million)
Thie site surveillance and enforcement sub-component will be implemented in Taka Bone Rate, Lease
Islands, and Padaido Islands (Irian Jaya). Site surveillance will rely on a combination of deterrent and
,r ventive approaches (Fig. 2):

The project will establish a Coral Reef S&E Unit at the provincial fisheries offices, responsible for patrol
scheduling, operation and reporting. The units will operate joint patrols between Dinas Perikanan,
SBIKSDA and KAMLA agencies. At the field level, groups of community Reef Watchers equipped with
haind-held radios will monitor reef activities and report any violations to the S&E unit. The unit's radios
will be tuned at all times to the Reef Watchers' frequency, and rapid response patrols will be deployed if
full enforcement action is found warranted. Upon completion of their patrols, the Reef Watchers and
paitrol units will fill in activity sheets, which will be assembled independently into weekly observation and
z,km records. Copies of the records will be sent to both the Provincial S&E unit and the Bupati's office.
The records will be audited yearly by the National S&E Unit to determine the effectiveness of the actions
taken in response to violation reports. The results will be used as an input to the incentives and rewards
program designed by the public awareness component.



-32-
Reef Watchers should: (a) be members of and selected by the local communities; (b) have good verbal
and written communication skills; and (c) have good knowledge of the local reef system and reef
practices. Consideration would be given to engaging former expllosives and poison fishers who have
eamed the respect of their communities. The Reef Watchers willI report to the S&E Unit and receive an
honorarium of Rp. 20,000 per day of patrol. Reef Watcher stations will be positioned strategically along
the coast, and be equipped with radio communications and minor field equipment (e.g. binoculars and
cameras). The Reef Watchers will nQI carry out arrests due to concems about personal repercussions,
but confine their duties to observation, recording and reporting.
Taka Bone Rate National Park    Due to the remoteness of the park (15-18 hours from Ujung
Pandang), and level of extemal threats (70-80 percent of the fishing effort), the project will support a full
deterrent and preventive surveillance strategy aimed at controlling the park's four access gateways
(Rajuni Kecil; Tarupa, Jinatu, and Pasitalu). A total of eight Reef Watcher stations will be established,
one in each of the inhabited islands, supplied with HFNHF bases and hand held VHF radios. Four patrol
boats with outboard, twin, 60 horsepower engines will be stationecl at the park's entry gates, supported
by a 65-70 feet transport vessel with a range of 500 nautical miles and three days of sea-keeping
capacity. Miscellaneous equipment for patrol and Reef Watcher stations (including global positioning
systems, vessel safety equipment, loud hailers, signal flares, binoculars and cameras) will also be
provided. The ground patrols will need to be supported by an estimated 10 hours/week air surveillance,
which will be leased locally from Navy NOMAD aircraft stationed in Ujung Pandang and funded by GOI.
Depending on the progress of field operations, the project could ailso help support a vessel registration
system in the park. Vessels under 5 gross tons (GRT) would be issued a free license and fishers' permit.
Vessels of 5-10 20 GRT with a history of fishing in the park, would operate under a traditional fishers
permit and a paid license. Vessels above 20 GRT, which are not permitted to enter or fish in the park,
would be the main target of park surveillance efforts. The following aspects will require close attention
during the development of a surveillance system for the park: (i) clairification of the rules of entry into the
park, which remain unclear under the current management plan; (ii) a fuller understanding of use pattems
within the park, including interactions between extemal and internal fishers; and (iii) effective conflict
resolution, following a framework similar to that of Annex 12.3.
Lease Islands:   The Lease Islands site (Saparua and Nusa Laut islands) has strong traditions of
marine customary management  The project strategy for this site will focus on preventive enforcement
(Reef Watch System), which could be expanded during COREMAP II to a deterrent approach if
warranted. The project will provide communication equipment (FIFNHF base radios, VHF hand-held
radios, motorcycles) and minor field equipment to nine Reef Watcher stations located strategically around
the two islands, and help expand the existing Nusa Laut coast watch system to Saparua. In order to
facilitate follow-up and prepare for COREMAP II, a Provincial Coral Reef S&E Unit will be established at
the Provincial Fisheries Agency in Ambon.
filan Jaya (Padaido Islands): Even though site support to Padaido is not expected to be included until
COREMAP II, GOI has requested that surveillance for Irian Jaya be introduced to counterbalance an
expected shift of mobile threats from South Sulawesi and Maluku. F-unding for surveillance operations in
this site would be conditioned upon a satisfactory surveillance needs assessment during COREMAP I.
Sub-Component 3.3: Surveillance Training (US$0.2 million)
The project's consultants will assist the PMO in developing and conducting a national training module for
S&E operations. The training will first be implemented at the national level, shifting to the provinces
during the last two years of implementation.  Three training modules are envisaged: Orientation, Reef
Watchers Training, and Law Enforcement. The key topics and target audiences are as follows:

Project Component 4 - Community-Based Management (US$2.0 million)
The community-based management (CBM) component will seek to improve the condition of coral reef
ecosystems in two pilot sites (Taka Bone Rate and Lease Islands), through reef management plans
designed, implemented and monitored by local communities. The project will provide technical
assistance, community support services (travel, per diem, remuneration, and minor field equipment for
field facilitators), workshops, training, and village grants to empower communities in this task.
Recommended interventions include reef sanctuaries, restrictions on fishing access, catch or effort, and
local activities reducing threats to reefs. The component will be closely linked to the legal framework, to
enisure legal backing of reef management plans of traditional user rights. The project will also fund a
study in each site on the optimal location of conservation zones and reef sanctuaries.
Of all project components, the CBM component remains the most untested. The few lessons of
experience argue for a focus on process and flexibility, where field activities can be continuously
adapted. The project's focus on only two sites and 12 villages is well suited to this approach. Lessons of
experience will be evaluated at the end of the project, and incorporated into program guidelines. The
CBM approach proposed below is therefore indicative and subject to adjustments during implementation.
Responsibilities: The CBM component will be facilitated by a highly qualified local LSM or a consortium
bletween a local University and an LSM, operating under a sub-contract to the Technical Assistance (TA)
team. This Community Support Group will deploy a Senior Field Manager at the district level, and Field
Mlanagers (facilitators) at the village level. The Senior Field Manager will serve as the key link between
the PMO and the District Secretariat and will supervise the work of Field Managers. Field Managers will
carry out the initial socialization, assist the communities in preparing the reef management plans, and
help establish the Reef Watch program. Village Motivators chosen from within the communities will assist
Field Managers in strengthening village groups (POKMAS) (Fig. 3). Due to the isolation of the project
sites, a ratio of three Motivators and one Field Manager per village will be used, although it is expected
that the Field Managers will operate in groups to maximize technical support. Assistance in specialized
fields will be provided by the project's TA.

Sub-Component 4.1: Site Support (US$1.3 million)
This sub-component will fund site management TA and community support services. The TA will include
a coral reef management specialist assisting both pilot provinces, shorl term technical specialists, and a
marine park management specialist in Taka Bone Rate.   Both project sites have LSM and University
programs, and to the extent possible, these would continue to be supported under COREMAP. The
agreed criteria for selecting the Community Support Groups and their key members are outlined below:

*"- This criteria could be relaxed if the LSM demonstrated exceptional qualifications in comparable sites.
Support to the CBM component will follow the agreed guidelines for village grants. The PMO will carry
out training of Field Managers prior to their deployment.    The project will also carry out annual
facilitators' workshops and cross visits, and produce a COREMAP bulletin to disseminate lessons
leamed under the program strategy and awareness components.
Field Managers will be subject to annual performance reviews, and evaluated based on their ability to (a)
develop an active interaction between community groups, local govemment agencies and the private
sector, (b) engage community members in participatory training activities; and (c) willingness to live at
the village level throughout their assignment.  Success in drafting reef management plans and
establishing altemative income generation will also be considered, although mitigating factors outside the
control of the Field Manager would need to be taken into account.
Sub-Component 4.2: Community Preparatfon (US$0.3 million)
This sub-component will fund initial community socialization (village workshops, group formation,
comparative studies, training, village awareness, and participatory mapping), leading to the development
This training is expected to be funded separately by AusAID for all pilot COREMAP I sites.



-35 -
of CBM plans. The budget for this sub-component will be included in the Community Support Service
contracts. The following activities will be supported under the project:
* Social Preparation, including (a) problem assessment, consultation and awareness raising; (b)
community training and extension on coral reef management, conservation awareness, micro-
enterprise needs analysis, and basic technical and management skills (including book-keeping); and
(c) group strengthening. The latter will include strengthening village groups and village institutions in
three key areas: Conservation (coastal habitat protection), Production (income generation through
micro-enterprise development linked to reef management) and Women's' groups. In the Lease
Island site, the project will also help strengthen inter-village traditional councils (Latupat,) to help
resolve village disputes and lead to the development of island-wide management plans.
* Formulation of Coral Reef Management Plans. Draft reef management plans will be developed
by the communities in close consultation with specialist TA and the Coral Reef Information and
Training Centers (CRITC) which will provide technical and scientific back-up. Indicative guidelines
for reef management plans and reef sanctuaries are given below:
Guidelines for Information to be Included in    Technical Guidelines for Reef Sanctuaries
Draft Reef Management Plans:
O  Sanctuaries should be strict no-take zones
O>  Key problems, and strategy proposed;                 (no extraction of marine products at any time);
4>  Community mapping;                             O  Recommended size: 20-30% of the total reef area;
4)  User nghts;                                    O  Sanctuaries should protect spawning aggregation
o  Map of proposed management units (e.g. sanctuaries);  sites for target species;
o)  Proposed management rules and sanctions;       O  Areas surrounding sanctuaries should be restricted
O  Local institutions responsible for the management plan;  for the use of traditional communities.
O  Infonnal monitoring proposed;
o Description of local Reef Watch system;
o Conflict resolution mechanism proposed (if applicable)
o Estimated funding and community contribution
Not: The Plan must be endorsed by village authorities
The project will in principle not fund artificial rehabilitation schemes such as artificial reefs.
Transplantation and restocking schemes will only be considered after the establishment of effective
management rules.
* Facilitating the Development of Alternative Income Generation (AIGs) Activities. AIG activities
will be aimed at reducing pressure on reef resources. Two types of AIGs will be considered (a) those
providing communities with a direct stake in sustainable reef management; and (b) substitution AiGs,
to replace destructive or over-fishing practices on reefs. To the extent possible, the Field Managers
will help establish partnerships between communities and private sector, to facilitate marketing and
ensure AIG sustainability.   The feasibility of potential AIGs will be assessed by the Production
village group, assisted by the field managers, TA and relevant district agencies. The criteria for
AIGs to be supported by the project is outlined below.
Criteria forAlGs:                Unproved technologies (such as grouper grow-
out dependent on wild fingerlings), fishing
*  Be financially feasible (18% minimum rate of retum)   boats, and  gear (except as required  for
.  Involve low risk                              substitution of destructive fishing practices) will
.  Have proven technology                        not be supported by the project, due to high

* Have developed markets
.  Must be 'reef friendly', i.e. lead to reduction in  might have  environmental impact will be
pressures to reefs                           evaluated against the sites' carrying capacity
*  No significant environmental impact.          and  any  mitigation  measures  proposed.
Examples of AiGs which could be supported by
the project include user pay schemes with
diving groups and promotion of diving tourism,



-36 -
eco-tourism based services, replacement of poison and blast fishing by sustainable gear (e.g. hook and
line), fish processing, and mariculture of native mollusks and seaweed where local marketing is ensured.
Field Managers will have a discretionary budget of US$5,0010 to support AIGs requiring rapid
implementation. The project will also provide training to potential AIIG beneficiaries in basic technical and
financial management.  Finally, the sub-component will provide information on existing credit
mechanisms, or (if no such credit is available) train community rnembers in establishing savings and
credit schemes. These are expected to be informal, and not result in official cooperatives.
Sub-Component 4.3: Site Management (US$0.5 million)
Once coral reef management plans and AIGs are identified, the communities will become eligible to
receive block grants from the project, up to a maximum of Rp. 150 million per village in Taka Bone Rate
and Rp. 100 million per village in the Lease Islands site. The grants will be provided in cash to the
village's LKMD, following certification of eligibility criteria by the Senior Field Manager and verification by
the PMO. Eligibility for the grants will be tied to the communities achieving the following milestones:
* A Draft Coral Reef Management Plan, formulated and adopted by the communities according to
project criteria, releasing up to 30 percent of the grant.
* Compliance with the above and formulation of an AIG Plan meeting project criteria, releasing up to
an additional 30 percent of the grant
* Appropriate initial Implementation of the Management Plan, where informal monitoring indicates
that management rules are being adhered to by the community, releasing the remainder of the grant.
The Block Grant can be utilized for the following:
* Incremental costs associated with implementation and monitoring of coral reef management plans.
*  Establishment of a local saving and credit scheme where alternative credit is unavailable5. The
maximum grant contribution would be 50 percent, against an equal amount in community savings.
* A maximum of 1:1 matching grants against loans approved under a village credit scheme or against
villagers' contributions, for AIGs meeting project criteria.
* Grants for 'reef caring infrastructure' up to a maximum of 80 percent against a 20 percent community
contribution, for (i) approved infrastructure or equipment to implement reef management plans; (ii)
infrastructure relieving pressure on reefs; or (iii) infrastructure required to support AIGs.
Disbursement of village grants will follow agreed guidelines, which could be adjusted periodically in
consultation with the Bank according to lessons of experience from the field. The funds transfer will be
certified by the Senior Field Managers at the district level, and by the Field Managers at the village level.
In addition to CBM, the project will support a park zonation study for Taka Bone Rate, implemented by
the CRITC at Hasanuddin University in collaboration with the park's conservation authorities. The study
will optimize the location of conservation areas (Zona Inh) and reef sanctuaries in light of the most recent
information on breeding grounds, species habitats, and coral distribution pattems. The project will also
support a small reef sanctuary zoning study in the Lease site, under contract to the CRITC in Ambon.
The following aspects will need to be closely monitored during CBMl implementation, to enable periodic
adjustments to project design: (i) the effectiveness of the selected AIGs and village grants in changing
the behaviors of villagers involved in reef exploitation; (ii) compatibillity between the total fishing effort of
resident fishers with reef management goals; (iii) fishing effort shifts to non managed areas; (iv) user
conflicts; and (v) the extent to which user rights of local communities are being protected.
Support to savings' schemes can only be reimbursed by the loan if used to fund productive activities.

Annex 4
Indonesia: Coral Reef Rehabilitation and IManagement Project
Economic Analysis
Annex 4.1: Cost Benefit Analysis Summary
A. General.         A detailed economic analysis of coral reel degradation in Indonesia was carried
out as part of project preparation . The summary, given in the table below, highlights the trade-ofFs
between short-term financial gains to indiiiduals doing destructive activities, and the costs they impose
on society. The table clearly shows the devastating economic consequences of a 'policy of inaction'. For
none of the threats do the short term financial gains to individuails approach the longer term costs to
society.  For example, coral mining is estimated to yield net benefits to individuals of US$ 121,000 per
km2 of reef in net present value terms versus total quantifiable costs to society ranging from US$180,000
to US$900,000/km2 of reef. These costs are affributed to a foregone net fisheries income equivalent to
US$94,000/ km2, loss of coastal protection functions, valued at US$12,000 to US$260,000, foregone
tourism net revenues of US$3,000 to 480,000 and forest damage due to collection of fire wood for lime
processing of US$ 67,000/ km2. The ranges in economic losses ior coastal protection and tourism are
attributed to variations in land use and tourism potential. These costs refer to quantifiable benefits only.
Other ecosystem function losses related to intrinsic biodiversity, coral spawning sources, and option
values have not been monetized.

B. Taka Bone Rate (South Sulawesi).             The following assumptions were made for the
economic analysis. The total area of Taka Bone Rate (TBR) is around 2,200 ki2, although the actual
park area is only 530 km2 . The reef area up to 25 meter depth - the basis for the calculations - is
estimated at around 500 km2 . The actual coast line area of the atoll is unknown. However, only 7 islands
are inhabited. The total coastline of these 7 islands is estimated al: around 25 km. The coastline is 100
percent rural with limited village infrastructure and agricultural land (palm trees). Coral cover and coral
mortality are reported for different sites in TBR by LIPI and Woild Wildlife Fund. Blasting and other
destructive fishing techniques have resulted in major damage to the reefs. Coral destruction, as defined
by the mortality index, is currently at around 60 percent, as confirmed by LIPI officials, with live coral
cover ranging from poor to fair.
The current fishing effort in TBR is not exactly known. Around 70 percent of fishing pressure is from
outside the Park; some fishers from TBR also fish outside the Park, and there is a de facto open access
situation. However, due to the distance to the main market and low population density in the Park (around
4,200 inhabitants), catches are higher than the average for other siites. Still, present resource rents are
assumed to be zero, except for destructive fishing. The current maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and
open access equilibrium are estimated at 6 and 3 mtlkm2lyr respectively.
6 See Cesar (1996) 'Economic Valuation of Indonesian Coral Reefs', for the detailed assumptions used.

Due to lack of fresh water, the local population does not have ice to preserve fish and hence dry the fish
o,r use it for home consumption. Groupers are an exception: they are either caught by hook-and-line
(IRajuni Kecil), or by traps and/or cyanide (done by outsiders and some locals), and kept alive in floating
cages. The larger scale external operations use ice to bring fish to the markets in Ujung Pandang,
';alayar and elsewhere. Prices are roughly US$ I per kg for fresh fish, US$ 0.66 per kg for blasted fish,
aind US$ 0.40 for dried fish. Groupers fetch around US$ 5/kg, but this depends on the size and species,
with top of the line, the Sunu 'super' worth nearly US$ 7/kg. Though it was confirmed that blast fishing is
practiced in TBR, the extent of this practice is unclear. It is estimated that in Ujung Pandang, 10-40
percent of reef fish landings originate from blast fishing. Here, we assume that 10 percent of catch is
from blast fishing. Accounts of cyanide use for groupers vary enormously. It seems that the large scale
operations (20 people) are increasingly moving to Maluku and Irian Jaya. However, medium-size
operations (4-5 people) continue to operate in TBR. The stock of groupers in TBR seems to be rapidly
clepleting: three years ago, fishermen in Rajuni Kecil, using hook-and-line, would catch on average five
groupers each or around 2 kg per day. Current catch rates in 'good' fishing days are one grouper of
around 0.6 kg average. This shows severe over-exploitation of the top reef predators. It is assumed
here that 6 2/3 percent of the total catch consists of groupers, and that 90 percent of this catch is caught
with cyanide.
Coastal erosion, probably due to past coral destruction, is widespread in TBR. In Rajuni Kecil, about 10
rneters of coastline (or one row of houses) have been lost to the sea over the last 20 years. Assumptions
on the relationship between coral destruction and coastal erosion are: (i) extensive damage leads to a 50
crm destruction per year; (ii) 1 percent loss in coral destruction leads to 1 percent coastal erosion without
a threshold. Given the absence of fresh water, pristine reefs, and few non-reef related tourism attractions
in TBR, it is assumed that the tourism potential of the Park is low. In Rajuni Kecil, there is one losmen,
but it is only used occasionally. Though tourism will probably never be a large source of alternative
income generation, it is currently at close to zero percent of its potential.
Trends:       Trends for each of the above key variables over 25 years are difficult to estimate. In the
'with' scenario, it is assumed that over the three years of COREMAP I implementation, enforcement and
surveillance will bring blast and poison fishing gradually to a near stand-still and that the current levels of
coral destruction, fishing yields, coastal protection and tourism potential will stay put for 3 years, after
which corals will recover quickly to 25 percent coral destruction in 10 years time, as confirmed by LIPI
eBxperts. The expected recovery will be relatively quick due to the predominance of Acropora spp. It is
assumed that fishery yield and coastal protection will return to 50 and 75 percent of their potential,
respectively, up from 20 and 40 percent. It is further assumed that blast fishing will come to a complete
stop 10 years after the end of COREMAP I. Also, it is assumed that the grouper fishery will stay at 6 213
lpercent of total catch, but that it will be caught through non-destructive techniques. Tourism potential,
though low, would gradually move to full capacity. In the 'without' scenario, it is assumed that blast and
cyanide fishing are continuing at present levels, leading to a increase in coral destruction of 75 percent in
:25 years, up from 60 percent. This would imply a drop in fishery yield to 12.5 percent of its potential, and
a drop in coastal protection to 25 percent of capacity (see project files for detailed assumptions). Tourism
potential would stay at 0 percent.
Results:      Given these assumptions, the quantifiable incremental benefits are estimated at US$13.5
million in net present value terms. These benefits are mainly due to a recovery of fish yield due to the
establishment of sanctuaries and the eradication of destructive fishing practices. The total costs over 25
years are very difficult to measure, as far-reaching assumptions need to be made concerning the costs
beyond COREMAP I. Two scenario's are considered. The first scenario is that GEF would provide
US$500,000 during COREMAP II, consistent with current plans. IBRD would fund an additional
US$350,000. It is assumed that GOI would support the costs of aerial surveillance, the reef watchers
program, and legal prosecutions, while keeping its staff involvement at provincial and district level in
place. Note that GOI has additional costs both in COREMAP I and beyond for park rangers and their
transportation, not included in project costs but still part of the economic analysis. Also, for the
calculations, only a part of district (75 percent) and provincial costs (25 percent) are attributed to the
costs of managing Taka Bone Rate. A sensitivity analysis was performed for a 'higher cost' scenario,
where it was assumed that in order to achieve the eradication of illegal and/or destructive fishing, a



-40 -
doubling of enforcement expenditures would be needed. In the 'stand;ard' scenario, the net present value
of net incremental benefits is US$ 5.0 million with an ERR of 14 percent. In the 'higher' cost scenario, the
net incremental benefits would drop to US$ 3.5 million with an ERR of 12 percent.

From GOI's perspective, its perceived rate of return could be thought of as not including GEF grant
funds. Excluding GEF costs, the ERR would become 17 percent in the 'standard' scenario and 15
percent in the 'higher cost scenario. This can be interpreted as the economic rate of return for
Indonesian policy makers. It indicates the rationale for GEF involvement, since under scarce resources,
the baseline scenario (with an ERR of 17 percent) would be more attractive for GOI than a project with
an ERR of 14 percent (the GEF alternative). This analysis excludes the biodiversity value and other non-
quantifiable ecosystem functions of Taka Bone Rate National Park.

C. Lease Islands (Maluku).          The following assumptions were made for the economic
analysis. For the purpose of the analysis, the coral reef area is defined as the reefs surrounding the
island groups of Saparua and Nusa Laut. No official estimates are available for this figure and local
conditions vary dramatically, with shallow reef fiats both in North and South Saparua and steep drop-offs
very close to the shore in Nusa Laut. Our own preliminary estimates, based on field observations and site
maps, are given in the table below. The Lease Islands are 100 percent rural, with mostly agricultural land
and modest village coastal infrastructure.

Coral conditions in the Lease Islands vary quite dramatically, depending on local threats. According to a
recent LIPI survey, coral conditions range from 'good to excellent' (Akoon, Nusa Laut), 'good' (Titawai,
Nusa Laut), 'fair (Ameth, Nusa Laut and most of Saparua) and 'poor' (Ihamahu, Saparua). However, field
observations and personal correspondence with marine scientists indicate that reef conditions in Ameth
appear to be better than 'fair'. As a rough estimate for the purposes of the analysis, a 50 percent coral
destruction and 'fair' conditions are assumed.
Current fishing effort varies considerably per location. Gleaning in Northern Saparua has led to a near
depletion of small mollusks on the reef flat. The situation is far beyond open access equilibrium. With
respect to near shore fisheries, the de facto fishing situation is one of open access, though the yields are
higher than what would be expected given the 50 percent reef destruction discussed above. The reason
might be a fairly low population pressure and other economic opportunities in agriculture. We assumed
here that for a 50 percent destruction and the quoted catch per day, the yield is 5 mtlkm2 Iyr for a
scenario in between open access and maximum sustainable yield (MSY) (1/3 above open access) or
33.3 percent of the MSY for an intact reef. Average ex-vessel prices received for fresh reef fish ranges
from US$0.8 to US$1.2 per kg depending on species, season, size, condition and supply and demand.
Therefore, US$ 1/kg was taken as the average. There is a market for grouper and other highly prized fish
due to the vicinity to Ambon and live grouper cages on Ambon island. Grouper prices for fishers vary
depending on location and middleman. An average of US$ 5 per kg of grouper was assumed. For
explosive fishing, no data were confirmed in Ambon, and a blasted fish price of US$ 0.66/kg, as per
Ujung Pandang, was selected.
It was confirmed that blast fishing is practiced in North Saparua by fishers from nearby villages. Though
there are no exact figures, it seems that blast fishing is practiced less than in other parts of Indonesia. A
preliminary estimate of 5 percent of catch from blast fishing was selected.  There is allegedly some
cyanide live-fishery going on. Given the proximity to the live cages in Ambon Island, live grouper catch is
indeed likely, though no estimates of market share could be obtained. Hence, a general average of 1/15
of catch as given by Cesar (1996) was assumed. Other threats to coral reefs in the area include coral
mining, though this is very limited in scope. The extent of coral destruction suggests some evidence of
coastal erosion. However, most of Nusa Laut and parts of Saparua have naturally robust stony
coastlines, so that the impact of reef destruction is very limited. Besides, the area is predominantly rural.
Therefore, coastal erosion was assumed to be small (Cesar, 1996; 'low' scenario). Given its proximity to
Ambon with international flights to Australia and proximity to the famous resort island of Banda, the Lease
Isilands have a reasonable tourism potential. However, the lack of infrastructure and absence of other
facilities render the Islands mostly unknown to tourists. Here we assumed that tourism potential is
moderate with a net present value of US$ 100 thousand per km2 of reef. It was further assumed that the
Lease Islands are presently at around 5 percent of this potential, with limited diving tourism in Ameth
(Nusa Laut) and a few losmen on Saparua.
Trends:      Trends for each of the key variables over 25 years are difficult to estimate. It was
assumed in the 'with' scenario that over the three years of COREMAP I, enforcement and surveillance
would bring blast and poison fishing gradually to a stand still and that the current levels of coral
destruction, fishing yields, coastal protection and tourism potential would then remain stable for 3 years.
AIter this, corals would re-build slowly and achieve full recovery in 25 years. Following Cesar (1996), it
was assumed that the pressure on the reefs would decline gradually (to 1/3 below MSY at the end of
COREMAP Ill and to MSY after 25 years). Grouper yields would stay at 1/15 of total catch and blast
fishing would stop during COREMAP II. Tourism potential would grow gradually, reaching full potential
after 25 years. In the 'without' scenario, it was assumed that blast and cyanide fishing would continue at
present levels, leading to an increase in coral destruction of 60 percent in 25 years. The fishery yield
would therefore drop to 20 percent of its capacity (open access and 60 percent; for assumptions, see
Cesar, 1996). Blast fishing would grow to 10 percent due to Malthusian overrishing, and grouper catch
would gradually decrease to 0 percent in 25 years. Tourism potential would stay at 5 percent.
Results:     Given slow coral recovery, and hence slow restoration of the functions of coral reef
ecosystems, most benefits accrue after completion of COREMAP I. The quantifiable incremental benefits
are estimated at US$2.4 million in present vaiue terms. In the longer run, in particular, annual incremental
benefits are expected to be large: around US$ 1.0 million per annum in year 25, due to much higher

fishery rents and tourism revenues. However, the intervention costs alter 3 years, both incurred by the
Govemment and through COREMAP II and l1l, need to be taken into account to compute the ERR. Given
the large uncertainty with regard to the success of the pilot phase, these future intervention costs are
unknown. As per Taka Bone Rate, two scenario's are presented: the 'standard' scenario assumes that
GOI continues with the enforcement expenditures of COREMAP I. The corresponding ERR is estimated
at 15 percent resulting in net incremental benefits of US$0.8 in net present value terms over 25 years
(see table). This can be compared with a 'higher cost' scenario with an ERR of 1 1 percent, in the unlikely
event that enforcement costs will need to double after COREMAP I in order to achieve the eradication of
destructive fishing in the area.

D. Sensitivity Analysis of an Unfavorable Exchange Rate Scenario. The analysis
shown above was performed under the prevailing economic conditions at pre-appraisal stage (July 1997)
when the exchange rate was Rp. 2,500 to the US dollar. The deepening financial crisis in Indonesia
requires, however, that a sensitivity analysis be performed on a extremely unfavorable exchange rate
and domestic inflation scenario. The assumptions for this 'Extreme Contingency Case' are presented
below:

A diramatic depreciation of the Rupiah would substantially decrease project costs in US dollar terms (see
Annex 5). However, it would affect incremental benefits only marginally, and therefore the ERR is
expected to increase relative to pre-appraisal estimates.  Only non-tradable goods (mainly labor and
local fish products) affect the ERR, since ERRs are at constant world parity prices and are therefore not
sensitive to inflation, or exchange rates on any tradable input or output.   The economic prices for
unskilled labor and local fish products in US dollar terms would decrease, however, and other prices
would stay constant. This occurs both in the 'with project' and the 'without project' scenarios.
The table below shows the impact of this extreme contingency scenario on the economic analysis of the
Lease Island site.  The ERR would go up to 19 percent as compared to 15 percent computed at pre-
appraisal.

Thiis analysis, however, abstracts from real economic pressures faced by individual fishers: under
unfavorable economic conditions, unemployment and poverty are likely to rise, social unrest may
intensify, and these factors combined may result in a higher likelihood of unsustainable fishing practices.
This could further increase the ERR, assuming that enforcement works well.  However, it could also
pose a substantial risk to the project if enforcement is ineffective. This added risk factor is recognized in
the project's logical framework and critical risks matrix (Section F.2 of the PAD).
T-he inflation, exchange rate and labor costs until year 2001/02 for this extreme contingency scenario are from
Vikram Nehru. Other figures are rough estimates. Tradable goods are assumed to fall in value due to the
economic crisis in importing countries, but less than non-tradables in US dollar terms.

Annex 4.2: Incremental Cost Aknalysis
Context and Broad Development Goals:
Coral reefs and their associated marine life are one of the greatest natural treasures of Indonesia. The
country is located at the center of the world's coral reef diversity. Inidonesia's coral reefs are estimated at
50,000 to 100,000 kin2, or approximately 12 to 15 percent of ithe world's reefs8.  The quality of
Indonesian reefs is, however, declining rapidly and even remote reefs are not free from man-induced
deterioration. It is currently estimated that less than 30 percent of Indonesia's reefs are in good condition,
with live coral cover above 50 percent. The main threats to the COREMAP Program sites are destructive
fishing practices (bombing and cyanide), coral mining, overfishing, isettlement pollution, and uncontrolled
tourism development. Without immediate interventions, it is likely that large areas of reefs will suffer
irreversible damage in the near future.
The COREMAP Program will consist of three phases, implemenited over 15 years. IBRD and GEF
funding will follow the Bank's new Adaptable Program Lending (APL) framework. GEF funding will assist
the first two phases of the program. By the third phase, institutionalization of the project should have
reached a level where GEF financing is no longer necessary. ADB, AusAID and JICA are expected to be
involved in supporting parallel projects under the COREMAP prograirn umbrella.
The proposed program is consistent with Indonesia's Biodiveirsity Action Plan, Agenda 21, the
Convention on Biological Diversity, GEF's Operational Program on Marine, Coastal, and Freshwater
Ecosystems, and guidance from the three Conference of Parties. It specifically responds to the Jakarta
Mandate stressing conservation and sustainable use of marine eicosystems. By focusing on Eastem
Indonesia, the proposed program portions expected to be supported by the World Bank and GEF will
help conserve an area which is believed to contain the richest coral reef, fish, and marine invertebrate
biodiversity in the world.
Baseline Scenario for Phases I and 11
Scope and Costs:    Under the baseline scenario, GOI would begin implementation of COREMAP
initiatives in the provinces targeted for World Bank and GEF financing. The Baseline Scenario would
focus on interventions having direct or indirect impact on livelihood opportunities for reef-dependent local
communities. While these sites are under severe stress, they aire often unrelated to areas of high
biodiversity importance. The baseline scenario would therefore comprise four major elements:
(a) Community Based Management in two Provinces (Maluku and South Sulawesi), expanding to four
Provinces in Phase II (Maluku, Irian Jaya, South and Southeast Sulawesi). Activities would include
reef management plan preparation and implementation; local awareness raising and community
training; altemative income generation to reduce pressure on coastal resources and enhance their
sustainable use; strengthened links with enforcement networks; and 'reef-caring' infrastructure to
relieve settlement impact on reefs. The baseline costs for this component are estimated at US$ 0.8
million for Phase I and US$ 12.0 million in Phase 11.
(b) Surveillance and Enforcement at the national, regional ancl site levels. The component would
include training, workshops, surveillance equipment, and operational enforcement costs. The
baseline costs for this component are estimated at US$ 3.1 million and US$ 6.0 million in Phase I.
(c) Program Strategy and Management. Under this component, GOI would develop the COREMAP
program strategy and guidelines, carry out project management, complete a legal review in support
S M. Spalding, personal communication, based upon a World Conservation Monitoring Center study.

of reef management, and carry out preparatory activities for Phase II. The baseline costs are
estimated at US$ 2.1 million, including technical assistance, and US$ 10 million in Phase II.
(d) Public Awareness, at the national and regional level. This component would include mass-media
campaigns, outreach programs and materials, dissemination of COREMAP guidelines and
awareness building workshops.  Baseline costs in the range of US$ 2.7 million are foreseen for
Phase I and US$ 7.0 million for Phase II.
Benefits.    Implementation of.the Baseline Scenario investment program will be important for the
rational use of Indonesian coral reef resources, both at the site level as well as for the country in general.
It is estimated that, at the national level, sustainable hook-and-line live-grouper fishery (as opposed to
cyanide fishing), could create jobs for an estimated 10,000 Indonesian fishers and generate net benefits
on the order of US$321,800 million in present value terms. Likewise, should blast fishing be prevented,
gains of up to US$482,000 per km2 in areas of high tourism value could be obtained. Should altemative
income generation and enforcement of traditional property rights be successful in reducing fishing
pressure from an 'open access' situation to an 'optimal sustainable yield', coral reef fisheries could
produce an additional US $70,000 in net present value per km2 of reef. The Baseline Scenario would also
lead to greater institutional capacity, general public awareness, and a stronger framework for reef
management in Indonesia.
The Baseline Scenario would, however, be insufficient to ensure the effective conservation and
management of sites of high biodiversity importance, since from both local communities as well as
regional governments' perspectives, these areas are often isolated and of reduced regional development
priority. Hence, the GEF Baseline would not be sufficient to ensure that high priority conservation areas
are included in future national COREMAP program strategies. The Baseline Scenario would also be
insufficient to ensure effective enforcement in sites of high biodiversity importance, effective involvement
ocf NGOs in field activities, and a public dissemination of lessons of experience, particularly amongst non-
giovernmental stakeholders.
Global Environmental Objectives
The global environmental objective of the GEF Alternative is to protect, rehabilitate, and achieve
sustainable use of coral reefs and associated ecosystems in Indonesia. The Indonesian reef ecosystem
is believed to contain the richest coral reef, fish, and marine invertebrate biodiversity in the world. Given
their possible links, protection of Indonesian coral reefs would also assist coral reef regeneration in other
parts of the Indo-Pacific region.
GEF Alternative in Phases I and If
Scope and Costs.    Under the GEF Alternative, an expanded program  will be undertaken,
comprising activities focusing on both coastal poverty alleviation/ development through the rational use of
reef resources (generating domestic benefits), as well as protection of coral reef ecosystems of global
significance. Note that the estimates for Phase li are still preliminary given the nature of the adaptable
program framework. Currently, it is foreseen that the GEF altemative will supplement the components of
the Baseline Scenario in the following ways:
(a) Community Based management of one additional site in Phase I and three additional sites in
Phase Il:
The Phase I site will be the Taka Bone Rate National Park in the Flores Sea, which has
been identified as a first priority area for conservation under Indonesia's Marine
Conservation Atlas, as well as a priority under the Global Representative System of
Marine Protected Areas.   Taka Bone Rate is the world's third largest atoll, and
Indonesia's largest. The foreseen GOI expenditures over the coming 5 years are
considered insufficient to effectively protect the park from external threats, and maintain
core areas as sanctuaries. GEF incremental funding of approximately US$ 1.2 million in
Phase I and US$0.5 million in Phase II are estimated to be required.



-46-
*     The first proposed Phase II site is the Wakatobi (Tukang Besi) National Marine Park,
which is located in the Wallacea region (Southeast Sulawesi) and is COREMAP's closest
site to the perceived center of global marine 1biodiversity.  It was identified as a
conservation priority under Indonesia's Marine (Conservation Atlas, and declared a
nabtonal park in 1996. Up to 70 percent of the reefs remain in excellent condition, but
increasing threats - especially from commercial bombing, cyanide, mining and
overfishing - make it a priority for urgent conservation. The site has been managed by a
non-profit partnership group (Operation Wallacea) involving the private sector, NGOs
and govemment agencies. This group has succeeded in raising intemational attention
for the site, and is expected to raise US$6010,000 over the next six years in
sponsorships, paying diving volunteers, and entrance fees. This level of support is,
however, insufficient to effectively manage and protect this remote archipelago, and GEF
incremental funding of US$1.0 million is estimated to be required (for Phase II only).
*     The second proposed Phase II site is the Padaido Islands, located southeast of Biak in
northem Irian Jaya. This site has extensive and very diverse reefs, and is believed to
contribute to coral reef maintenance in Westem Papua New Guinea. It has suffered
bombing and recent earthquake damage, but is reportedly recovering due to local
initiatives to stop destructive fishing practices. Incremental GEF funding of US$ 1.0
million is proposed for the site (for Phase II only).
*     The third proposed Phase Il-site is the Spermoiide Islands, located in the eastem
border of the Makassar Straits. This site has the highest coral reef diversity recorded in
Indonesia (over 250 coral species) and one of the highest recorded in the world. GEF-
financing of this site would be conditional on rationalization of project locations and
activities to adequately address sustainable use across the reef ecosystem. The level of
support planned for the above sites during the project life is insufficient to ensure their
effective management, and incremental GEF funding of US$ 1.0 million is proposed (for
Phase II only).
Including the above four sites will add to the scope of what would otherwise be feasible under the
project. For all four sites, GEF financing will make possible the deployment of field facilitators
and site managers, training, awareness, preparation and implementation of management plans,
and limited equipment. Alternative income generation, a productive activity expected to bring
direct benefits to project villages, will be funded under the IBRD loan.  The estimated GEF
contribution to cover incremental costs in Phase I is estimated at US$1.2 million out of a total
GEF Altemative Cost of US$ 2.0 million. For Phase II, the! corresponding figures are US$ 3.5
million out of a total of US$ 15.5 million.
Surveillance and Enforcement. Additional financing under this component will increase the
assistance to GOI in developing a national reef surveillance strategy focusing particularly on
mobile threats (poison and blast fishing), including a study and pilot certification for introduction
of poison testing in Indonesia, and seminars to develop strategies to curb reef destruction. The
GEF altemative will also help efforts to strengthen the mcnitoring, control and surveillance of
GEF target sites. It is estimated that GEF will provide incremental costs amounting to US$ 0.9
million in Phase I and US$ 2.0 million in Phase II, out of a total GEF Altemative costs of US$ 4.0
million and US$ 8.0 million respectively.
*     Program Strategy and Management. Additional financing under this component will increase
the assistance to GOI in preparing a national COREMAF' program strategy with a stronger
emphasis on conservation area protection.  Supplementary legal support, especially in
strengthening community user rights' systems, will also be provided. The GEF Altemative will
also support an independent panel evaluation of Phase I results, which would be used to
disseminate lessons of experience for subsequent program phases. Additional items in the GEF
Altemative will include final preparation of globally signiificant Phase II sites, as well as
incremental project management assistance necessary to support GEF activities. GEF financing
for this component would be quite limited, in the order of US$ 0.8 million in Phase i and US$ 1.0
in Phase II, resulting in a total GEF Altemative cost of US$ 2.9 million and US$11.0 million,
respectively.



-47-
*     Public Awareness. GEF funds are envisaged for enhanced national and regional-level coral reef
campaigns, as well as increased involvement of local groups and NGOs; incremental support for
a system of yearly awards and public recognition to outstanding COREMAP participants; and
increased emphasis on decision makers' involvement and press coverage likely to benefit coral
reef protection throughout Indonesia. GEF incremental funding for this component is estimated
at US$ 1.2 million (Phase I) and US$ 1.0 million (Phase II), out of a total GEF Altemative cost of
US$ 3.9 and 8.0 million, respectively.
Benefits
In addition to the national benefits associated with the Baseline Scenario, global benefits of the GEF
Alltemative include:
*  Protection of globally significant biodiversity in priority coral reef ecosystems;
* Improved management of Take Bone Rate (Phase I) and Wakatobi (Phase 11) Marine National Parks;
*  Opportunity to test and expand community-based management both inside and outside protected
areas;
*  A strengthened legal framework for coral reef management in Indonesia;
*  Improved national policy and enforcement strategy for coral reef management;
*  Enhanced participation and public awareness amongst decision makers and the public at large;
*  Enhanced capacity building for coral reef management, particularly amongst NGOs;
In(cremental Costs
T he total costs of the Baseline Scenario are estimated at US$ 8.7 million in Phase I and US$ 35.0 million
in Phase II. The GEF Alternative is estimated at US$ 12.8 million in Phase I and US$ 42.5 million in
Phase 2. The incremental costs of the GEF Alternative are therefore estimated at US$ 4.1 million (Phase
I) and US$ 7.5 million (Phase II). The Asian Development Bank, AusAID and the Japanese Intemational
Development Agency (JICA) are involved in financing parallel projects within the COREMAP program
that would amount to an additional financing of approximately US$13.3 million in Phase I and US$ 57.5
million in Phase II. These contributions are additional to the estimated Baseline Scenario for the current
project. GEF funds are not expected to be required during Phase l1l, as the program will have matured
to the point where most global benefits would also be expected to result in domestic benefits. A GEF
grant of US$ 11.6 million (US$ 4.1 million in Phase I and US$ 7.5 million in Phase II) is therefore
requested to support the COREMAP Program.

Main assumptions:   Post-project expenditures were estimated for both program costs, and individual
COREMAP sites. COREMAP II and IlIl are expected to focus primarily on geographical (site) expansion,
thus involving a relatively high (but decreasing) proportion of investment costs.   Phases II and IlIl are
estimnated to involve an additional 10 to 14 sites at an investment cost of US$2.0 to US$2.5 million per site,
including enforcement. The remaining investment expenditures would be spent on program management,
capacity building, expanded surveillance activities, and continued awareness. Site expansion would cease
at the conclusion of the program, leaving recurrent expenditures (primarily related to surveillance)
averaging US$200,000 per site per year. At the conclusion of Phase IlIl, all recurrent program expenditures
would be expected to be financed by GOI under a block grant transfer to regional govemments.
Investment costs account for an estimated 92 percent of average site expenditures during COREMAP I.
Site investment would continue to be required for 2-3 years following conclusion of Phase I, and would
theretfore be included in COREMAP II funding. Recurrent expenditures estimated at US$200,000 per site
per year, would be needed in perpetuity to cover surveillance operation costs. These would be covered by
GOI as part of its sovereign duties in archipelagic and territorial waters.
B. Financial Analysis of Village Micro-Enterprise Activities
A detailed financial analysis was performed on prospective altemative income generation (AIG) activities
supported by the project. Eight representative microenterprise models were identified as possible AIGs.
These include: (i) bag-making; (ii) brick-making; (iii) kerupuk ikan (fish crackers) processing; (iv) terasi
processing; (v) pearl oyster culture; (vi) seaweed culture and drying; (vii) snorkelling and fishing equipment
rental; and (viii) seabass floating cage culture. The details of the financial analysis of each microenterprise
are included in the Project Implementation Plan. Since the project will be demand driven, livelihood projects
not included in the analysis could be chosen by beneficiaries after review by the project team. Hence, the
enclosed analysis should be regarded as indicative.



- 50-
The financial analysis of each of the microenterprises covered a period of six years, including an
establishment period of one year and an operation period of five! years. The financial assessment was
based on several financial indicators including: (i) investment costs; (ii) working capital requirements; and
(iii) annual operating costs. Operating cost items included wages, production materials, repair and
maintenance costs, depreciation and interest payments. The results of the financial analysis are
summarised in the two tables below.   The first table summairises the analysis of individual micro-
enterprises.  The aggregate results of the second table takes into account the total costs and benefits
weighed by the assumed adoption rate for individual enterprises, as displayed on the '# of activities" column
of the first table. The results indicate financial rates of return (FRR) ranging from 28 percent to 59 percent,
well above the estimated weighted average capital cost of 18 percent. The benefit-cost ratios for the
activities range from 1.08 to 1.26. The Net Present Value (NPV) for the various activities varies
considerably from US$748 to US$4,380. For the assumed aggregate package of a total of 50
microenterprises and an investment of US$35,000 by a group of 387 investors, the estimated FRR is 39
percent, the benefit-cost 1.17 and the NPV US$ 21,600.

C. Justification for Village Subsidies
Rieef sanctuaries and other fisheries management interventions can be expected to yield benefits relatively
quickly in the form  of increased fisheries productivity.   Reef sanctuaries, for example, can typically
replenish surrounding fishing grounds within a period of 3-7 years. The financial rate of return for average
reef sanctuaries in the Philippines is 28 percent, indicating that recurrent expenditures are more than offset
by the benefits of management. Nonetheless, reef sanctuaries involve an initial closure of 20-30 percent of
the reef area, imposing short-term costs to traditional fishers; hence a short-term subsidy is likely to be
justified. The estimates below are for Taka Bone Rate: the calculations assume a closure of 30 percent of
the area, leading to a short term drop in catch of 30 percent, which would recover to pre-sanctuary levels
around year three. The catch would continue to gradually increase until leveling off after 7 years with a
doubling of the initial catch. These assumptions are in line with recent recovery rate studies of marine
reserves. The initial catch by local fishers is assumed to be worth US$450,000 per year, based on the
assumption that local fishers operate in 30 percent of the area (70 percent of the fishing effort in the park is
external), or 150 km2 of reef. There are five villages in the project site.
As indicated in the table below, the losses in the first two years amount to about US$28,000 per village over
a period of two years, using the assumptions outlined above. Hence, an initial subsidy of US$25-30,000
equivalent per village for alternative income generation activities and village infrastructure 'reef-caring'
investments, as determined by the project, is considered justified.

D. Impact of an Unfavorable Exchange Rate
The Table below illustrates the impact of a scenario where the Indonesian economic crisis would deepen
to extreme conditions.           Under the assumptions below, the unused  funds would amount to
approximately US$1.7 million in loan funds, US$0.9 million in GEF grant funds, and US$0.5 million in
GOI counterpart financing. Should such a scenario arise, the Bank would discuss with GOI at mid-term
review whether to cancel the expected project savings, or reallocate funds to incremental project
outputs.

Annex 6
Indonesia: Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Maniagement Project
Procurement, Disbursement, and Financial Management Arrangements
A. Procurement
Procurement methods (Table A)
Procurement of goods and services will follow the World Bank's 'Guidelines for Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995, and revised January and August
1996 (for works and goods), and the "Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants
by World Bank Borrowers' dated January 1997 (for services). The World Bank's standard
bidding documents and contracts will be used. All procurement will be handled centrally by the
Project Management Office (PMO). The Project Director will approve all contracts prior to
signature by the Project Manager (Pimpro). The project's procurement plan is detailed in the
Project Implementation Plan (PIP).
Goods
Goods (US$2.2 million) procured under the project will include surveillance equipment funded
under the Bank loan and GEF grant (US$2.1 million), and office and other equipment for project
management, funded by GOI  (US$0.1 million).  Surveillance equipment comprising
computers, radios, faxes, maps, cameras, surveillance vessels, GPS, safety equipment (e.g.
life jackets, flash lights, and identification vests) and other minor field equipment will be
procured under Intemational Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, in reasonably sized lots of
US$50,000 or more. A margin of preference for domestically manufactured goods can be
applied. The surveillance equipment will be distributed to the Directorate General of Fisheries
(in Jakarta) and to the Provincial Fisheries Offices in South Sulawesi and Maluku. The patrol
vessels will be of civilian specifications, and will be appropriately marked as being under
Govemment Service as required by the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea.
services
Services (US$7.8 million) procured under the project will include awareness campaigns,
technical assistance, community support services, and spiecial studies.   The project's
awareness campaigns (US$3.4 million), including specialized services, TV and radio
production, awareness materials, training, and miscellaneous campaigns, will be contracted to a
professional public relations firm, using quality and cost based selection (QCBS) and an output
based contract. The firm could, at its prerogative, sub-contract specific parts of the campaign
to qualified local groups or NGOs. The contract will be processed in two phases (i) campaign
design; and, subject to a satisfactory design, (ii) campaign implementation.    Provincial
awareness activities will be funded separately by the Government at an estimated cost of
US$0.2 million.
The project's  technical assistance contract (US$2.5 million) for strategy and policy
development, legal advice, monitoring, control and surveillance, reef management, and
technical support, will be procured through a competitive, quality-based selection (QBS). Since
it is vital that the technical assistance be of the highest professironal quality for the development
of the long-term program framework, price will not be a factor in the selection.
Community support services (US$0.3 million for the Lease Island site and US$0.4 million for
Taka Bone Rate) will include field managers stationed at the clistricts and project sites, village
motivators, field equipment, and expenses associated witth community support such as



-53 -
workshops, training, awareness, and participatory mapping. These services will be procured
under two contracts (one for each pilot site) to highly qualified local non-govemmental groups
(LSM), or a consortium between an LSM and a local University, according to the selection
criteria specified in Annex 2. The community support groups will be sub-contracted by the
winning TA firm. The short-listed TA firms will specify how the community support services will
be managed, but will not name the sub-contractors in their bid. The winning TA will then select,
either through a direct contracting procedure or through a competitive process, the most
qualified LSM/University group for each site.  The sub-contracts for the community support
group will be subject to prior review by the Bank. Direct sub-contracts with community support
groups could be justified based on their unique expertise and continuity needs at the site level.
Special studies (US$1.0 million) will consist of park management and zonation for Taka Bone
Rate, a sanctuary zoning study in Lease Islands, two to three legal and enforcement studies, an
independent evaluation for COREMAP I, and a feasibility study for COREMAP II.  The legal
and enforcement studies, averaging US$55,000 each, will be procured through selection
based on consultant's qualifications, but without price considerations.
Funds for park management and zonation of Taka Bone Rate (US$180,000), consisting of
expert advice, mapping, site surveys, demarcation, and workshops, will be contracted out to
the Coral Reef Information and Training Unit (CRITC) at Hasanuddin University in South
Sulawesi. The University has been actively involved in assisting PHPA with park zonation, and
the CRITCs future role in site monitoring make it uniquely qualified to provide this assistance. A
parallel reef sanctuary study (US$55,000) will be carried out at the Lease Islands site under
contract to the CRITC in Ambon.
The independent evaluation of COREMAP I (US$220,000) will be carried out by an
independent evaluation panel, selected according to the criteria specified in Annex 2, sub-
component 1.4. The World Conservation Union (IUCN), would be selected to manage the
panel under a sole source contract, and would consolidate the evaluation results. IUCN would
be able to comment on the composition of the panel, and would be expected to ensure the
quality (but not the results) of the independent evaluation.
The detailed design of COREMAP 11 (US$370,000) will be included in the TA contract, with
release of the funds subject to satisfactory performance of the firm during project
implementation.
Miscellaneous
Miscellaneous procurement items (US$2.7 million) will include operation and maintenance for
surveillance operations (US$0.7 million), surveillance training (US$0.2 million), workshops
(US$0.3 million), village grants (US$0.2 million), public relations (US$0.3 million), and project
management (US$1.0 million).  These items will be procured according to Govemment
procedures acceptable to the Bank.
The Bank and GEF will finance the incremental costs of surveillance maintenance and
operation (US$0.3 million) in accordance with the incremental cost analysis of Annex 4.2.
This will include vessel fuel, equipment maintenance, and minor equipment replacement; and
allowances and local patrol costs for community reef watchers.  Aerial surveillance will be
provided by GOI at an estimated cost of US$0.2 million. Fuel, spare parts, and minor equipment
replacement, valued at less than US$50,000 per lot, which may be required 'on the spot' to
ensure the safety of operations at sea, will be purchased under local shopping procedures.
Surveillance training (US$0.2 million) is expected to be contracted out to specialized
institutions. Specific law enforcement training, which may need to be conducted by
enforcement agencies such as the Police and the Navy, will be funded by counterpart funds.
The Project Management Office will organize all major workshops and seminars, in
collaboration with the technical assistance team. Village grants (up to a maximum of Rp. 150



-54 -
million per village in Taka Bone Rate and up to Rp. 100 million per village in Lease Islands) will
be provided as a cash transfer to village LKMDs, against the production of reef management
plans meeting project criteria. The grants will be used to fund eligible expenditures related to
reef management, strengthening of savings' groups, alternative income generation, and reef-
caring infrastructure, as detailed in Annex 2 and using community participation procedures. The
LKMDs will have overall responsibility for overseeing the procurement of goods, works and
services under the village grants: goods procured by village groups will be based on prudent
local shopping procedures in accordance with the approved village grant plans. Materials and
equipment required for reef-caring infrastructure will be collected from local sources or, if not
available, purchased from outside sources based on local shopping procedures. Payment for
collection will be calculated on equivalent person-days and taken into account in infrastructure
expenditures. The Senior Field Manager and the Coral Fteef Management Specialist will
monitor the progress of village grant activities.
Public relations expenditures will include the production, printing and distribution of program
guidelines, press briefs, public awards, and organization of special events, such as a Reef
Watchers' day. Local shopping procedures will be used whenever appropriate.   Project
management expenditures (US$1.0 million) wili be funded by GOI.
Prior Review Thresholds (Table B)
Prior review will be required for (i) all ICB goods' contracts above US$50,000 per contract; (ii)
consulting firms above US$100,000 equivalent per contract (including awareness services and
studies); (iii) individual consultants above US$50,000 equivalent (including studies); (iv) all
community support service sub-contracts; and (v) sole source contracts. This will ensure prior
review of approximately 86 percent of the IBRD/GEF financxd items. Other items will be
subject to an ex-post evaluation during supervision, amounting to approximately 10 percent of
the transactions.
B. Disbursement
Allocation of loan and GEF grant proceeds
The allocation of loan and GEF grant proceeds is shown on Table C.
Use of statements of expenses (SOEs):
Disbursement based on Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) will be used for (i) goods below
US$50,000 equivalent; (ii) awareness and public relations activities below US$100,000
equivalent; (iii) consulting firms below US$100,000 (including studies); (iv) individual consultants

All supporting documentation, including contracts, procurement information, and evidence of
payment, will be kept at the Project Management Office and Provincial Project Offices for review
by the Bank and independent auditors.
Special account:
GOI will establish two separate special accounts at Bank Indonesia for the IBRD loan and the
GEF grant. The initial deposits will be US$1 million for the IBRD loan and US$500,000 for the
GEF grant account, equivalent to 4-5 months disbursements. The special account will be
opened in US dollars and maintained by the Directorate General of Budget.

C. Financial Management
hntemal Control Structure
The project's Internal Control (IC) structure, consisting of project management policies and procedures,
will follow GOI's internal control system. This system is considered satisfactory to the Bank based on
its: (i) accounting system; (ii) organization structures; (iii) delegation of authority and responsibility
practices, such as job descriptions; (iv) management control methods, including an internal audit
lunction, budgeting, variance analysis and forecasting; (v) enforcement policies established by the
Government; (vi) authorized execution of transaction; (vii) limited access to assets; (viii) comparison of
recorded amounts with existing assets; (ix) trained staff, and (x) segregation of functions in ways which
prevent staff from perpetrating and concealing errors and irregularities.    Transparency will be
emphasized under the project, and the concept will be introduced to the LKMD and village groups as
part of the internal control.
Organization
The PMO will have a Project Manager (Pimpro) to manage project funds and a Treasurer
(Bendaharawan). They will be provided with assistance, as necessary, on procurement, technical and
financial matters. The Project Manager and Treasurer will meet the following qualifications:

Annex 11
Indonesia: Coral Reef Rehabilitation and IManagement Project
Social Analysis and Participatory Approach
Considerable resources have been invested in social assessment and consultation activities during project
preparation. These activities include participatory consultative workshops with key stakeholder groups, site
surveys and participatory rural appraisals (PRAs), and development of pilot site-based activities with local
NGO groups. These activities were implemented by the Governmmnt of Indonesia through the Indonesian
Institute of Sciences (LIPI) and local Universities, preparatory technical assistance (AMSATJEcolink), and the
Indonesian Biodiversity Foundation (KEHATI) in collaboration vwith a network of local NGOs.  Site
assessments were carried out in all COREMAP program provinces, including sites which will be the target of
the Acceleration Phase (COREMAP II). The site information has been assembled in a CD-Rom database and
monitoring tool.
Summary Social Analysis Activities Include:
Preparation Technical Assistance:
+  literature review
*  provincial level consultations with task forces
*  district-level task force consultation
+ consultation with LKMD and village chiefs at locations
+  community meetings facilitated by village leaders (involving 40-50 participants)
*  focus groups with key stakeholders
LIPI
*  questionnaire survey for 150 households per location
+  in-depth interviews with 150 informants
PRAs in selected sites (Padaido Islands, Irian Jaya, and Spermonde Islands, South Sulawesi)
+  Social assessment activities conducted by local universibes with local NGOs in selected sites (LP3M, in
South Sulawesi, Rumsram, in Irian Jaya)
KEHATI
+ key NGOs identified for each province
+ local workshops for proposal development
* review and selection of 21 small grant proposals for funding in fives COREMAP program provinces (South
Sulawesi, Maluku, Irian Jaya, West and East Nusa Tenggara).
These participatory approaches will continue during project implementation through the following activities:
*  Public awareness component - support to information dissemiination and awareness about the project
targeted at key stakeholders at the national, regional and local level. NGOs and local communities are
expected to participate directly in these activities.
*  Establishment of local commiffees-to allow for feedback and information from stakeholders on project
implementation.
*  Continued support for Social Assessment in new sites.
*  Support for community based management activies involvingl local NGOs, including the development
of participatory zoning and management plans, PRAs and participatory beneficiary monitoring of reef
activibes.

Social:
Saparua and Nusa Laut were originally populated by people from Seram. Some villages in Saparua and the neighboring island of
Haruku are inhabited by Butonese Moslem migrants. The islands depend primarily on agriculture. Fishing, primarily for skipjack, small
pelagics, shellfish, sea cucumber and reef fish, is practiced for both subsistence and trade. The site has good potential for community-
based management due to the prevalence of customary marine rights (petuanan laut), with access to some fishing grounds and
seasons regulated by customary practices (sasi). For commercial resources, however, traditional sasi (sasi adat and sasi gereja), has
increasingly been replaced by govemment-led seasons and auctioning systems (sasi ,elang). Increasing commercial pressures have
resulted in sub-optimal closures and declining productivity. User conflicts sometimes arise between local residents and seasonal
extemal fishers. In addition, there have been recent conflicts in Haruku over a mining exploration concession claimed to affect the
productivity of coastal grounds.  In Ameth, Nusa Laut, the village govemment has institutionalized a user pay system with diving
operators, where Rp. 25,000 per boat is collected in exchange for reef protection. Marine tourism is expected to increase in Nusa Laut,
and may require arrangements to ensure that a larger proportion of the benefits are retained by island communities. Yayasan Hualopu,
a local NGO, has been working with island communities in developing participatory resource mapping and strengthen community
organizations. The main threats to local reefs include bombing, traps, overfishing, mining, and wading on reef flats.
Project Strategy: COREMAP I will start on two locations in Saparua and Nusa Laut, where community-based management efforts are
on-going. These locations would constitute loci for expansion into island-wide managernent during COREMAP II.

Social:
The atoll is inhabited by a mixture of Bajau and later-arriving Buginese, many of whom are involved in patron-client (paonggawa-sawi)
systems. Up to 70-80 percent of the fishing effort comes from extemal fishers, originating from Sinjai, Flores, Buton, Ujung Pandang and
Baeli. Fishing activities, including squid, live food (cyanide), bombing, shellfish collection, and traps, are the main economic activities in the
islands. Women play important roles in reef gleaning and processing. There is no fresh water and transportation and communications
with other areas is limited. This, associated with a high dependence on ponggawas for credit, contributes to low socdo-economic
standards and limited income opportunities. The area has been hard hit by the cyanide fish trade and extemal pressures. Enforcement
efl'orts have been launched in recent years, but institutional coordination remains a problem, and individual abuses of authority have been
reported. Recent efforts by NGOs active in the park (LP3M, vWvF), the district govemment, and Hasanuddin University, have helped
strengthen community groups, and raise local awareness, leading to declines in fish bombing and coral mining; however, much remains
to be done to control extemal fishing, improve institutional coordination, optimize park zonation, and develop sustainable income
opportunities for atoll residents.

Country Director
World Bank Resident Mission
n1. Rasuna Said,
Kav. B-10, Suite 301, Kuningan
Jakarta 12940
Dear Mr. Dennis de Tray,
In our discussion with the World Bank mission, the Government of Indonesia
expressed interest in applying for Adaptable Program Loan (APL) to support our initiative
in the implementation of Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Program
(COREMAP), especially for the conservation of areas with high biodiversity richness.
Following the discussion, we have prepared the attached proposal for COREMAP
Implementation which we are now seeking your assistance to obtain APL support
Coral reef T-ehabilation and management issues are stated in both our Marine
Biodiversity Action Plan and the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan (REPELTA-VI) as
our priority. The ultimate goal of the COREMAP program is the protection, rehabilitation
and sustainable utilization of coral reefs and associated ecosystems in Indonesia, which
will, in turn, enhance the welfare of coastal communities.
COREMAP has three phases and is proposed as a 15 year program Initiation
Phase (CORENMAP I/Years 1-3), Acceleration Phase (COREMAP EIVYears 4-9), and
Institutionalization Phase (COREMAP IUIYears 10-15). The objective of COREMAP I is
to establish a viable framework for implementation of a national coral reef management
system. The objective of COREMAP II is to establish viable reef management systems in
priority sites in ten provinces (South Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi, North Sulawesi,
Maluku, Irian Jaya, North Sumatra, West Sumatra, Riau, West Nusa Tenggara. and East



- 78 -
Nusa Tenggara). The objective of COREhMAP In: is to establish viable management
systems in priority sites, which are operationaJl, fully decentralized to regional
goveTnments, and institutionalized (through specific block grants to regional
governments).
COREMvAP is an inter-sectoral and inter-agency project. In initiation stage,
Bappenas has been proposed as the coordinating agency, the Indonesian Institute of
Sciences (LIPI) will be doing as executing agency, and involving Directorate General for
Regional Development (BANGDA). the Oftice of the State Ministry of Environment and
other relevance agencies, both at the national and local levels.  Imnplementation
responsibilities for the program area expected to be devolved progressively to district
governments during phase I} and phase m. During the preparation stage, high
commitment for community participation and inter-agency collaboration has been
achieved.
Your agreement to the inclusion of this project in the APL funding is now sought
in order that following activities can be implemented. Enclosed, please find the indicative
financing plan (attachment I), policy framework, benchmark indicators and institutional
arrangement proposed for COREMAP T, II and m  (attachment II, m  and IV), and
summary of project desain for COREMAP I (attachment V).
Thank you for your continued cooperation.
