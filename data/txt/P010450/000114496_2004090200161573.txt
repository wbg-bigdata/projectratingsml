          of this Schedule;
    (b)   (i) to repatriate its initial capital investment,

          suitable arrangements for the Investment Enterprise to
          be compensated, for loss of profits, initial capital

          failure of any of the Borrower's institutions to
          perform their obligations owed to the Investment
          Enterprise or the occurrence of a political event,
          whose causes are beyond the control of the Investment
          Enterprise, involving the Borrower;
    (c)   to adjust the price of energy produced or services
          provided by the Investment Project in accordance with
          agreed adjustment indices to reflect changes in prices
          of inputs and exchange rate movements, but not
          necessarily so as to reflect changes in any other costs
          of the Investment Project;
    (d)   to take appropriate measures to off-set the effects of
          any changes in duties and taxes and other actions taken
          by the Borrower or its agencies affecting the cost and
          price of energy produced or services provided by the
          Investment Project as previously agreed with the
          Borrower;
    (e)   to receive additional finance from the Fund, on terms
          and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, so as to
          enable the Investment Enterprise: (a) to meet up to 80%
          of any additional financing needs of the Investment
          Project arising from an increase in the costs thereof,
          provided the Investment Enterprise finances at least
          20% of such needs through equity investment; and (b) to
          continue to meet its debt service payments in respect
          of the Investment Project in the event of delay in the

          operations of the Investment Project resulting from
          causes beyond the control of the Investment Enterprise;
          and
    (f)   to enter into arrangements under which the commercial
          loans and/or export credits obtained for the purposes
          of the Investment Project shall have priority over the
          financing obtained from the Fund for such purposes in
          the allocation and distribution of funds available with
          the Investment Enterprise for purposes of making debt-
          service payments and/or meeting obligations arising in
          the event of liquidation.

Projects in the power sector, the Borrower shall, having,
pursuant to the Statement of Policy, as of January 1, 1994, set
the bench-mark tariff based on the avoidable cost (as defined

Page  23
of electricity at high voltage from the private power sector at
the equivalent of $0.065 per kilowatt hour (kWh):
    (a)   review such tariff once every six months, taking into
account changes in the cost of commercial borrowing, foreign
exchange risk cover, operation and maintenance (O&M) and fuel,
and, to that end, continue to provide an explicit outline of
the indices to be used for such adjustment, with an explanation
of the methodology used for deriving such indices and the
approach to be adopted for their application;
    (b)   in particular, ensure that the return on the
investment component of the price of electricity produced by the private
power sector shall be indexed to annually compensate for the
depreciation of the rupee relative to the dollar; and
    (c)   ensure that any taxes, duties and levies imposed on
the private power sector shall be reflected as pass-through items
in the price of electricity produced by such sector and
collected from consumers.

adjustment, pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs 1 (a) and
(c) above, of the tariff for non-tradable energy products,
other than electricity, produced by Investment Projects in the
energy sector, and services provided by Investment Projects in
the energy-related infrastructure sector, the Borrower shall:
    (a)   review such tariff once every six months, taking into

investment component of the price of such products and services
produced or provided by the private energy and energy-related
infrastructure sector shall be indexed to annually compensate
for the depreciation of the rupee relative to the dollar; and

the private energy and energy-related infrastructure sector shall
be reflected as pass-through items in the price of such
products and services, and collected from consumers.

                Investment Enterprise by the main contractor
                responsible for implementing the Investment
                Project, to which such lenders/creditors shall
                have recourse in the event of delay in the
                implementation of the Investment Project;
         (ii)   to provide for its lenders/creditors to have

                Project, to which such lenders/creditors shall
                have recourse in the event of a shortfall in the
                performance of the Investment Project; and
Page  24
         (iv)   to establish, and shall enable the Investment
                Enterprise to establish, either at the outset of

and deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3
(a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be
limited to an amount equivalent to $1,000,000 until the
aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the
total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered
into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General
Page  26
Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of
$10,000,000.
2.  Payments out of the Special Account shall be made
exclusively for eligible expenditures in accordance with the
provisions of this Schedule.
3.  After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it
that the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the
Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish
the Special Account shall be made as follows:
    (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a
deposit into the Special Account of an amount or amounts
determined by the Bank to be required to pay for eligible
expenditures during the four months following the date of each
request, which amount shall not exceed the aggregate amount of
the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw
from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such
amount or amounts as the Bank shall have determined to be so
required.
    (b)   (i)   For replenishment of the Special Account, the
                Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for
                deposits into the Special Account at such
                intervals as the Bank shall specify.
           (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such request,
                  the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the
                  documents and other evidence required pursuant
                  to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment
                  or payments in respect of which replenishment
                  is requested. On the basis of each such
                  request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
                  Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and
                  deposit into the Special Account such amount as
                  the Borrower shall have requested and as shall
                  have been shown by said documents and other
                  evidence to have been paid out of the Special
                  Account for eligible expenditures. All such
                  deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from
                  the Loan Account under the respective eligible
                  Categories, and in the respective equivalent
                  amounts, as shall have been justified by said
                  documents and other evidence.
4.    For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and
other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively
for eligible expenditures.
5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further
deposits into the Special Account:
      (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined
that all further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly
from the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of
Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of
Section 2.02 of this Agreement;
      (b)   if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the
Bank, within the period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b)
(ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of
the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Account;
      (c)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the
Borrower of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the
Page  27
right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General
Conditions; or
      (d)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan
allocated to the eligible Categories minus the total amount of
all outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank
pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect
to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount
of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible
Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall
specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals
shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall
have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit
in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that
any payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an
expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph
2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence
furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank
may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if
the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal
to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree,
no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall
be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made
such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that
any amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be
required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures,
the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund
to the Bank such outstanding amount.
      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund
to the Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the
Special Account.
      (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6
(a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan
Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement,
including the General Conditions.
