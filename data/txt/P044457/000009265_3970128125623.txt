REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
EMERGENCY TRANSPORT AND MINE CLEARING PROJECT
I.     THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
1.    The primary objectives of the Project are to: (1) repair and reconstruct the surface
transport networks within Croatia and between Croatia and BiH and (2) clear landmines in areas of
high economic priority for reconstruction. By rebuilding the transport system, it is expected that
delivery of construction materials to BiH will be accelerated and that the traditional regional trade
patterns will be reestablished. The repair and reconstruction of local transport networks will also
provide some of the critical elements needed for the return of refugees and displaced persons.
Clearing of landmines is an essential first step in the repair and reconstruction of infrastructure
networks, in the rebuilding of other facilities (such as schools and clinics) and in the return of
refugees and displaced persons to their homes.
Project Design and Description
2.     The Project is part of a post-war infrastructure reconstruction program supported by three
projects: (1) reconstruction of regional transport systems and clearing of landmines (the object of
this report,) (2) rebuilding of regional water supply and sewerage networks, and (3) reconstruction
of major infrastructure in the Eastern Slavonia region of Croatia. The first two projects are largely
regional in nature, benefiting users in both Croatia and BiH. The Eastern Slavonia project would
focus on infrastructure needed locally, but would also rebuild facilities needed for improved
economic ties with neighboring countries. The water and sewerage project is in the final stages of
preparation and will be presented once final agreement has been reached between Croatia and BiH
on the arrangements for implementation and, if applicable, agreements concerning on-lending and
repayment of funds. Initial preparatory work has also begun on the project in Eastem Slavonia.
Among other issues, consideration will be given to the mechanisms for implementation and
supervision of the project during the remaining period of the transitional administration.
3.     The proposed Emergency Transport and Mine Clearing Project will cover the first phase of
the reconstruction program. The transport sector was selected for Bank support since the needed
agreements between Croatia and BiH have been signed and the joint implementation committee has
been established and begun work. Design of the major investments has been completed and agreed
and preparation of tenders await only the approval of the proposed Loan. (Additional information
on fimding of the transport investments is discussed under Project Implementation.) The Project
finances only investments that could be implemented within a period of two to three years and does
not include major upgrading of infrastructure or sector restructuring. Such larger investments have
been left to separate projects under initial stages of preparation, for example, for Croatian railways
and ports. Clearing of landmnines is included in the Project as a necessary component of the
reconstruction program.



TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 2 OF 32
4.     The proposed Project investments are:
Transport Component
*  Roads and Bridges: Repair and reconstruction of the Zupanja-Orasje bridge (the parts of the
bridge located in the territory of Croatia) which crosses the Sava River into BiH from eastern
Croatia, 130 kms of roads and about 30 road bridges primarily through Lika and Cordun in the
former UNPA areas, and upgraded road access to Ploce Port. The estimated cost for roads and
bridges, excluding contingencies, is US$ 33.8 million.
*  Railways: Reconstruction of the Lika line (Ostarije-Knin-Split/Zadar) and the Novska-Sisak
line. The investments on the Lika line will consist of the Debeljak tunnel at Skabrnje near
Zadar, safety equipment at the Skabmje station, 9 automated barriers at road crossings along
the line, renewal of 45 kms of track, and spare parts for 15 locomotives. On the Novska-Sisak
line, two rail bridges (over the Strug and Sava Rivers) will be rebuilt. The estimated cost for
railways, excluding contingencies, is US$ 23.6 million.
*  Ploce Port: Repairs and reconstruction of Pier 5 (main pier) and Pier 3, the pier ladder and
fendering system, the roll-on-roll-off terminal, container handling equipment, and various war
damages to equipment, piers and buildings. The estimated cost for the investments at the Port,
excluding contingencies, is US$ 18.6 million.
Mine Clearing Component
e Clearing of mines im areas of high priority for economic reconstruction (with first priority to
Project areas,) quality assurance of cleared areas, initial screening based on mine maps,
surveys to estimate the probability of areas being contaminated by mines, and technical
assistance, including training for mine clearers, instructors, and possibly dogs, where such
dogs are trained to identify the location of mines. Total investments in mine clearing, excluding
contingencies, will be US$ 27.2 million.
Project Implementation
5.     The Project Implementation Plan is included as Chapter IV of the Technical Annex. The
Project will be implemented by the agencies directly responsible for the respective programs.
Project Indicators
6.     As an emergency operation, the relevant Project indicators relate to speed of procurement
and Project implementation. These are: (1) percentage of Project funds committed by supplier
contract; (2) funds disbursement (including issuance of Bank Special Commitments;) and (3)
percentage of completion of Project.

I.    TRANSPORT COMPONENT
Background
7.     Traditionally Croatia has provided one of the main east-west transport links between
western Europe and the Balkans. Since 1991, war has disrupted many of these links. Much of the
main transport infrastructure was damaged due to war activities or deferred maintenance. With the
signing of the Washington Accords in early 1994, the Government of Croatia began to rebuild the
transport infrastructure. Following the approval of the Dayton Accords in December 1995 and the
end of hostilities in the region, the Govemrnment began a full-scale reconstruction program.
8.     Due to its central location, Croatia's infrastructure constitutes an essential part of the
transport network for the regional economy, including BiH and Serbia. The regional network
includes: the road and rail lines from Zagreb to Belgrade, the rail lines from Rijeka to Hungary, the
road and rail bridges across the Sava and Una Rivers into Bosnia, and the sea-port at Ploce in
southern Croatia. In addition, the Government of Croatia has initiated a program to repair and
reconstruct the roads and bridges running parallel to the Adriatic through Lika and Cordun. These
lines are located in the former Sectors North and South and, until 1995, were not accessible to the
Government of Croatia.
9.     Following the signing of the Dayton Accords, NATO has rebuilt (or plans to rebuild) parts
of the transport network, as needed to move troops and supplies into Bosnia. IFOR has built two
temporary pontoon bridges at Zupanja-Orasje in eastern Croatia and has plans to put in place a
temporary rail bridge at Volinja between Bosanski Kostajnica and Bosanski Novi in northeastern
Bosnia. While the bridges provided a quick means of handling military (and some civilian) traffic,
traffic capacity is limited. To serve the needs of the regional economy, it will be necessary to
replace the IFOR bridges with permanent facilities capable of handling normal traffic loads.
10.    Since the 1960s, the Bank has been lending to Croatia (as part of the former Yugoslavia)
for the transport sector. The Bank provided a loan in March 1995 for the Highway Sector Project
(Loan Number 3869-HR) to finance building of the roads system in the areas then under
Government control. In addition, the Bank has begun preparation on projects for the railways and
ports. However, the transition to a market economy has meant substantial and material
restructuring of the railways and ports in order to reduce the annual subsidies needed. To assist in
the preparation of such restructuring, consultants' studies are underway and are expected to be
completed by late 1996. The proposed program is independent of the outcome of the studies and
will cover repairs and reconstruction that will be needed regardless of the details of the future
sector strategy for the railways and the ports.
Objectives
11.    The primary objective of the transport component of the Project is to finance the repair and
rebuilding of essential regional transport infrastructure. The Project will: rebuild a major surface
transport link between eastem Croatia and north-eastem Bosnia, upgrade the primary seaport
(Ploce Port) serving Bosnia, and repair and rebuild the road and rail networks needed to improve
efficiency of transport throughout Croatia.



TEC}INICAL ANNEX PAGE 4 OF 32
Design
12.    The Project design focuses on the crucial investments needed immediately by both Croatia
and BiH for the reconstruction of the regional economy. Care was taken to ensure to avoid the
major investments in rehabilitation and upgrading of transport infrastructure where such
investments should be made only following the completion and full review of the sector
restructuring studies. This particularly applies to the railways and the ports investments for the
Project.
Description
Roads and Bridges
13.   The Project will cover investments for roads and bridges, railways, and for the Port at
Ploce. The most crucial investments for roads and bridges will cover: the Zupanja-Orasje bridge
across the Sava River, roads and bridges primarily through Lika and Cordun, and the road access
to the Ploce Port.
14.    The Zupanja-Orasje bridge represents the main road link between Croatia and north-
eastern Bosnia through Vukovar-Vinkovci-Tusla-Sarajevo. Almost 40 percent of the bridge has
been destroyed, including all the main upper structure crossing the river and the two central piers.
Only the structure in the north and south flood plains were undamaged. The existing foundations
were only slightly damaged. The program thus includes rebuilding a 304 meter bridge section and
constructing new piers using the existing foundations. The IFOR bridges built at Zupanja were
removed in March-April due to the Spring floods. All the road bridges to be rebuilt were damaged
or destroyed during the hostilities, with the amount of damage ranging from deterioration of
surfaces and railings to complete destruction of the bridge, including foundations. The average cost
for repairing the bridges is estimated at US$ 500,000 per bridge. In addition, about 130 kms of
roads through Lika and Cordun have been damaged or destroyed, due to shelling or deferred
investments. Many of the roads also provide access to the bridges noted above. The roads program
will also include construction of a new road to Ploce Port. The current road traverses the city of
Ploce, creating inefficiencies and hazards for both port and city traffic. The new access road of 2.3
kms joins the Port to the Adriatic Highway (M2) about 2 kms west of the Port.
Railways
15.    The railway components are located on two main lines, that is, the Lika line (Ostarije-
Knin-Split/Zadar) and the line between Zagreb and Belgrade. The investments foreseen for the
Lika line are:
* Skabrnje Station Safety Equipment. The Skabrnje station safety equipment was completely
destroyed during the war. The cable network was damaged and the building itself was burnt
down.
* Level Crossings. All 28 level crossings on the line were destroyed. All had light and sound
signals (some with and some without barriers.) Nine light signals with barriers on the crossings
will be installed on the roads with the heaviest traffic crossing the railway tracks.



TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 5 OF 32
*  The Debeljak Tunnel. The Debeljak tunnel has a length of 1.3 kms and is located on the section
Skabrnje-Bibinje. During the war, a wagon full of explosives was placed on the line in the
direction of Zadar. The wagon exploded at the entry to the tunnel, destroying 70 meters of the
entry and 330 meters of the tunnel lining. Under the program, the tunnel will be rebuilt.
*  Track Renewal. On the Ostarije-Knin line, three sections totaling 45 kms have been selected
for renewal. The track on these sections is in bad condition. It was last repaired over 20 years
ago, and then with used material. The sections are: Ostarije-Plaski (20 kms) Gracac-Malovan
(6 kms) and Licko Lesce-Perusic (19 kms.)
*  Spare Parts. Spare parts for 15 locomotives will also be purchased, including diesel motors
and electrical equipment, air conditioning systems and electric heating equipment.
16.    On the Novska-Sisak line the repair of two bridges is included under the Project.
*  Strug River Bridge. This bridge is 110 meters long and has three spans. During the war the
first span structure was destroyed while the other two were damaged. The Project covers a full
repair of the bridge.
*  Sava River Bridge. The bridge and the damages and destruction are similar to that at the Strug
River bridge. Both bridges are located near Novska.
Ploce Port
17.    The Port of Ploce has historically served BiH as well as Hungary and Serbia. The war
reduced the traffic through the Port to about five percent of prewar levels. Port installations were
damaged by air and naval bombardments in 1992 and pier 5, the main facility for loading and
unloading bulk cargo, has been damaged due to lack of repair and maintenance, overloading, and
possibly original construction deficiencies. In its current state, Ploce Port is unable to handle more
than minimal levels of cargo traffic. The Project includes the following urgent investments.
*  Pier 5 Rehabilitation. In order to define and design the necessary works, consultants have been
engaged. They will also work out the bidding documents. The assignment started in June and
will take about four months. Financing is provided by the Dutch Government under a separate
project.
*  Handling Equipment. There is a need to replace the destroyed equipment and acquire
equipment to handle containers, that is, a mobile tired crane, a stacker, tractors, and trailers.
*  Repair of Various War Damages. Damages to be repaired were inflicted to mechanical
equipment as well as to buildings and piers. Repairs will be made to: the grain terminal,
warehouse 4A, pier cranes 2 and 3, repair of windows and doors in various buildings, pier 2
pavement, and warehouse 9.



TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 6 oF 32
*  Pier Ladder and Fendering System. Pier ladders and a proper fendering system are lacking and
needed to allow for efficient operation of the Port. Relevant support is provided under the
Project.
*  Pier 3 Repairs. Pier 3, which is the oldest pier in the port, is in a poor condition with serious
deformations and risks a possible collapse. Part of the pier has already been rebuilt and the
remainder will be built as part of the Project.
*  Roll-on-roll-off Terminal Renewal. The roll-on-roll-off terminal, which dates from the 1960s is
located close to the main square of the town of Ploce. The terminal was used by tanks and
heavy military trucks. As a result, more than half of the pavement is broken or in poor
condition and will be repaired under the Project.

railways by Croatian Railways (HZ,) and ports by the Ploce Port Authority. For the transport
component, the MMTC is establishing a small Project Unit (PU) which will prepare all
disbursement requests for the transport component and will consolidate reports by the transport
agencies under the Project.
21.    The implementation schedules for the various investments reflect a three year program
(1996-98) with the major part of the activity falling in 1997. For many of the investments, designs
have been completed and the implementing agencies are ready to start (or have already begun)
procurement. For example, for the Zupanja-Orasje bridge, design for reconstruction has been
completed and some of the damaged pieces have been cleared from the river. However, for some
investments, such as the rehabilitation of pier 5 in Ploce Port and the repairs to the Lika railway,
construction might not be completed until the third quarter of 1999.
22.    For all investments except the Zupanja-Orasje bridge, implementation of the transport
investments in the proposed Project will be the sole responsibility of the Croatian agency, that is,
HC, HZ, or the Ploce Port Authority. For the bridge, the Governments of Croatia and Bosnia have
agreed that the costs will be shared 50:50 and have established a joint bridge commission to
implement the investment. Most of the work in procurement and implementation will be conducted
by HC and the joint commission will approve only final decisions for the program. Recognizing the
importance of close cooperation for the bridge, in March 1996, the Governments of Croatia and of
BiH signed a memorandum of understanding with regard to transport connections between Croatia
and BiH  (Attachment 1.) In April 1996, the Governments signed a resolution on joint
implementation. The resolution names the members of the eight person commission and the
responsibilities of the commission (Attachment 2.)
2   Excluding taxes and duties. Detailed numbers may not add to totals due to rounding.



TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 9 OF 32
23.    For the Ploce Port, in May 1996 the Governments of Croatia and BiH signed an agreement
giving Bosnia access to the Adriatic Sea through Ploce (Attachment 3) and an agreement giving
Croatia passage through BiH at Neum (Attachment 4.) The Ploce agreement allows passage of
goods on a duty-free basis and ensures that tariffs at Ploce Port are set no higher than those
charged at other major Croatian ports (such as Rijeka.) Specific concession contracts will be
negotiated by private investors with the Port, and in the case of long-term concessions, with the
Government. The inter-governmental agreement provides a framework for such concessions and is
satisfactory to the Bank. The agreement is in accordance with the 1982 Convention on the Law of
the Sea, the 1965 Convention on Transit Trade of Land-Locked Countries and the 1923
Convention and Statute on the International Regime of Maritime Ports.
24.    Procurement information provided to the Bank will include: prompt reporting of contract
award information, and comprehensive explanation of revised cost estimates for individual
contracts and the total Project, revised timing of procurement actions, and compliance with
aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement. During negotiations, agreement was reached
with the Government on all procurement arrangements.
Economic Evaluation
25.    Many of the components deal with repairing and putting into operation installations. These
repairs are prerequisites for the functioning of wider systems. This applies to most of the bridges
and the Ploce Port components as well as to the repair of railway installations which have been
directly or indirectly damaged through war activities such as the station installations and tunnel
repair. For such components no explicit economic evaluations have been carried out. For some of
the major components the Croatian authorities have carried out evaluations. These concern the
road rehabilitation, repair of the regional bridges and the Lika line track renewal. These
investments account for two-thirds of the total.
26.   Road Rehabilitation. The IRR (internal rate of return) varies from 14 to 49 percent. The
evaluation was prepared by Croatian authorities in accordance with conventional methods for this
type of works. The appraisal and results are included in the Project File.
27.    Regional Bridges. For this group, a system of ranking was established taking into account
the importance of the road section, forecasted traffic, route length without the bridge, importance
of reconstruction for the economy and environmental considerations. The results are included in the
Project File.
28.    Lika line Track Rehabilitation. In the feasibility study prepared by HZ, the economic rate
of return is estimated at 12 percent. The study is in the Project File.
Risks
29.   The risks involved mainly concem those investments which depend on an agreement
between Croatia and BiH. This concerns the Zupanja-Orasje bridge and the Ploce Port. For the
Zupanja-Orasje bridge an agreement between the two governments, spelling out the intentions and
principles for reconstructing the bridge, was signed on March 14, 1996. The Croatian/BiH
Implementation Commission foreseen in the agreement has been established. For the Port of Ploce,
as noted above, a bi-lateral framework agreement has been signed (May 1996.)



TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 10 OF 32
III. MINE CLEARING COMPONENT
Background
30.    Landmine contamination is expected to be a problem for much of Croatia's program to
rebuild war-damaged infrastructure. At the end of 1995, there were an estimated three million
landmines, dispersed primarily along the 1,180 former lines of confrontation. The major areas
affected were former sectors south and north (Lika and Cordun) and sectors west and east
(Western and Eastem Slavonia.) The area south of Karlovac is thought to be heavily contaminated,
as it was previously used as a military training camp. Landmines were used as invisible barriers,
denying access to facilities of all kinds: residential housing, public buildings, agricultural land,
roads, railways, bridges, power and gas networks, water and sewerage systems. Most of the mines
are difficult to detect, since they were made primarily from plastic. Many of the existing minefield
maps and records are unreliable, many minefields have not been mapped, and some areas have
been mined and re-mined by both sides, in patterns which make subsequent detection difficult.
Clearing all the mines will take years, probably decades, and will be very costly. In addition,
considerable quantity of unexploded ordnance (perhaps as much as ten percent of all bombs)
remains along the former confrontation lines. All references in the text to mine clearing also apply
to ordnance disposal programs.
31.    Priority is being given to mine clearing in support of infrastructure reconstruction needs,
but the exercise is unlikely to cover all the priority sites. Until recently all de-mined areas were
cleared to military, rather than civilian (humanitarian) standards and will require verification.
Despite the efforts to date, the majority of mines have not yet been cleared and a major effort to
complete clearing is now required.
32.   In all the areas where there have been hostilities, particularly where there has not been
continual presence of civilians, there is a risk of mines and unexploded ordnance. The return of
displaced people and refugees, which is anticipated to gather momentum in the spring and summer
of 1997 lends added urgency to the problem. The presence of mines within towns as well as in
agricultural areas is cause for concern. In addition, no reconstruction of major infrastructure can
take place until their sites have been cleared of mines. The economic costs imposed by the delays in
the reconstruction and recovery program thus make the need for mine clearing urgent.
33.    Until recently, most mine clearing in Croatia was conducted by the army, with assistance
from local special defense forces. However, the Government of Croatia has recognized that mine
clearing for economic reconstruction and other civilian purposes should be conducted by civilian,
rather than military, organizations. In March 1996, Parliament approved the Act on Clearing of
Mines. Among other things, the Law provides for a state mine clearing company (MUNGOS)
under the MOI.
34.   In a plan prepared in January 1996 by the MOI and the Ministry of Reconstruction and
Development, the Government of Croatia described the proposed national mine clearing program.
The program summarizes the Govemment plans to establish a national mine clearing capability.
The program also sets out in general terms the proposed training of mine clearing staff and the
deployment of trained groups of mine clearers. The plan also identified clear priorities for mine
clearing. They are: facilities needed for economic reconstruction, power lines, rail and road
networks, public buildings, residential housing, and agricultural areas.



TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 11 OF 32
Objectives and Design
35.   The objectives of the proposed program in mine clearing is to: (1) clear landmines in the
Project areas and (2) clear mines in other high priority areas needed for economic reconstruction.
The program will ensure rapid and efficient clearing of the areas for the investments in the
transport component and will provide a base for full development of the national capacity for mine
clearing. In preparing the mine clearing component of the Project, the Bank has been in close
coordination with the UN agencies directly involved in mine clearing, including the UN MAC in
Zagreb and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs in New York.
Description
36.    The investments will cover: mines in areas of high priority for economic reconstruction
(with first priority to Project areas,) quality assurance checking of cleared areas, initial screening
based on mine maps, surveys to estimate the probability of areas being contaminated by mines, and
technical assistance, including training for mine clearers, instructors, and possibly dogs, where
such dogs are trained to identify the location of mines.
Estimated Costs and Financing Plan
37.    The estimated costs and the financing plan are given below.

Implementation
38.   Implementation of the Mine Clearing program will be done through the MOI, which has
established a PU for the component. The mine clearing work will be completed by contractors
selected through a competitive process (i.e. ICB.) Possible bidders could include the state mine
clearing company (MUNGOS,) foreign mine clearing companies and joint ventures between
qualified foreign and domestic enterprises. The MOI will let contracts and evaluate bids.
39.   In addition, a specialized Quality Assurance Unit has been established in the Ministry.
Assisting the QA Unit will be representatives of the United Nations Mine Action Center (MAC) or
other internationally recognized technical experts, who will provide technical and implementation
advice to the QA Unit. (Draft terms of reference are included in Attachment 5.) The QA Unit will
set the standards to be met -- generally 99.6 percent of all mines -- and will review the standard
operating procedures of the contractors. In addition, the QA Unit will be responsible for conducting
QA of areas cleared by contractors or by others, such as military forces.



TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 12 OF 32
40.    The Bank's experience in the mine clearing program for BiH can be applied for the
program in Croatia. In particular, the Bank's standard bidding documentation has been reviewed,
and for mnine clearing, customized to reflect the specific issues related to mine clearing contracts.
All mine clearing works will be procured using ICB (see Project Implementation Plan.)
Procurement of QA equipment will be conducted by ICB, NCB and LIB and contracts for
consultant services and other technical services will follow Bank guidelines on the hiring of
consultants. In addition, the MOI may require some technical assistance in procurement and in
administering and supervising contracts. For this, an external adviser should be hired for advice
and assistance and funded either by donors or the Ministry's budget. (Sample terms of reference
for the technical experts is included in Attachment 6.)
41.    Given that civilian mine clearing is a new activity in Croatia, the Ministry of the Interior is
reviewing acceptable quality targets for mine clearing and acceptable methods of clearing and of
establishing quality assurance. The targets and acceptable methods for mine clearing and quality
assurance will be included in the tender documents for bidders. A discussion of current mine
clearing techniques -- and some of the lessons learned -- is included in Attachments 7 and 8.)



TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 13 OF 32
IV.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
Implementation Arrangements
42.    For the World Bank Loan of DM  150.9 million for an Emergency Transport and Mine
Clearing Project, the Borrower is the Government of Croatia represented by the Ministry of
Finance. It has been agreed that the Finance Ministry will delegate implementation responsibility to
the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Communications (MMTC) and the Ministry of
Interior (MOI.) A Project Coordinator within the Finance Ministry will be responsible only for
monitoring Project activities. Implementation of the Project (including all aspects of procurement
documentation and submission of disbursement requests) will be the responsibility of the
implementing agencies.
43.    The agencies responsible for the activities to be implemented under the Project are
described below. Apart from the MOI, all agencies have demonstrated capacity to successfully
implement the Bank procurement procedures, having completed procurement for other Bank
projects. Training in Bank procurement will be made available to the MOI as needed to ensure
smooth Project implementation.
*  MMTC - Within the MMTC, a Project Unit (PU) is being created. Two of the transport
agencies -- the Croatian Railways Company, the Croatian Roads Administration -- have
extensive experience with Bank procurement guidelines and have successfully implemented the
transport components of the Emergency Reconstruction Project. The Ploce Port Authority is a
new agency, but has staff experienced in Bank procurement procedures and will call on the
Roads Administration for assistance in procurement, as needed. It is expected that the Port
Authority will be able to efficiently conduct procurement for the Port investments. For
investments to be implemented under the transport component, the PU will consolidate reports
prepared by the direct implementing units and will submit disbursement requests to the Bank
for investments in the transport component.
*  MOI - Implementation of the Mine Clearing Component will be conducted by the MOI,
through the PU. Clearing of areas will be awarded by contracts, with selection by a
competitive tender to be conducted by the Ministry of the Interior. The MOI will also conduct
tenders for the purchase of QA equipment and will hire consultants as needed for training etc.
Since the Ministry has little experience in Bank procurement, technical assistance will likely be
needed for procurement and initial implementation of the Project.
44.    Project monitoring will be conducted by the Project Coordinator within the Finance
Ministry. The Project Coordinator was established under the Capital Markets Project and will have
also coordination responsibility for the Enterprise and Financial Sector Project and the related
Technical Assistance Project. (Under the Emergency Reconstruction Project, coordination was
provided by the Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development, HBOR, formerly HKBO, due
to the complexity of the Project and the large number of beneficiaries under the Emergency
Reconstruction Project.) In addition a procurement workshop will be held (in late October 1996)
with a focus on procurement of mine clearing contracts.



TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 14 OF 32
45.    The Project Coordinator reports directly to the Assistant Minister of Finance. The
functions of the Project Coordinator are to: ensure preparation and distribution of consolidated
periodic reports to the relevant Government agencies and financial institutions; summarize
disbursement requests submitted by the beneficiary agencies to the Bank; prepare reports required
for the interim review and prepare recommendations for the reallocation of funds among Project
components, where funds have not been committed under supplier contracts; and ensure
preparation of the Government's contribution to the Implementation Completion Report (ICR.)
46.    The implementing agencies will be responsible for implementation of the parts of the
Project that include the hiring and supervision of consultants. The procurement process followed
will be in compliance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers
and by the World Bank as Executing Agency.
Procurement Arrangements
47.    Due to the urgent nature of the Project, the program need to be contracted and supplied
quickly. Procurement will follow the Bank Guidelines developed for the Bosnian emergency
projects, except that ICB will be used for all contracts for works and goods over US$ 2 million
(rather than US$ 5 million as in the Bosnian program.)
48.    To the extent practicable, items to be procured under the Project have been grouped into
major packages to encourage competitive bidding. Under the Project, the proposed methods of
procurement will include International Competitive Bidding (ICB) National Competitive Bidding
(NCB) Limited International Bidding (LIB) and Direct Contracting (DC.) A General Procurement
Notice (GPN) will be published in The Development Business in October 1996.

TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 16 OF 32
Transport
Works
49.   International Competitive Bidding (ICB) Procurement packages for civil works exceeding
the equivalent of US$ 2 million per contract will be procured through ICB. In addition, where a
procurement package includes a subcomponent where the cost of a single section (such as a road
section) is estimated to exceed US$ 1 million, the full package will be bid under ICB procedures,
even if its estimated cost is less than US$ 2 million. (The limits of $ 2 million and $ 1 million were
set for the First Highway Transport Project for Croatia and the same limits will be maintained for
the proposed Project.) For the transport component, the equivalent of US$ 43.3 million for about
six ICB packages will finance civil works.
50.    All ICB  packages for civil works will be prequalified. The Bank's standard
prequalification documents will be followed. In the interests of expediency, the notice inviting
contractors to apply for prequalification will be published as part of the GPN. The information in
the completed questionnaires submitted by firms will be used to carry out their general
prequalification for different levels in terms of contract values. The prequalified firms will be listed
m a registry and the registry will remain open for additions and deletions over the course of Project
implementation. The prequalification criteria will be approved by the Bank.
51.    National Competitive Bidding (NCB) Packages of civil works contracts between US$ 1
million and US$ 2 million will be procured through NCB. With respect to roads and bridges, civil
works are dispersed and of small value (the equivalent of less than US$ 2 million per contract.)
Foreign bidders are unlikely to be interested because of the limited size of the contracts, the often
remote locations of the sites and the presence of competitive and strong domestic civil works
contractors.
52.    Direct Contracting (DC) will be used for the repair of existing structures, using
proprietary technology and equipment. For the transport component, DC will be used to finance
pre-stressed elements of up to three partially destroyed bridges. The bridges were built using
proprietary methods and the replacement elements will use the same technology. About three
packages will be procured for transport works for a total of $1.6 million.
Goods
53.   ICB will be followed for procurement packages estimated to cost more than US$ 2 million
per package. In the case of procurement of goods through ICB, eligible domestic firms will be
accorded a preference margin equal to 15 percent or the prevailing duty (for the purpose of bid
evaluation only) whichever is lower, in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. For
the transport component, packages for goods and materials equivalent to US$ 2.3 million for one
or two packages will be procured through ICB.
54.    DC will be used for proprietary items, where justified to maintain compatibility and
standardization and where the Bank agrees procurement can be made only from the original
suppliers. For the transport component, DC will be used for spare parts for rail locomotives. DC
will cover about 2 packages for an aggregate value of $ 2.3 million. DC not identified in the
procurement plan will be subject to the Bank's prior approval.



TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 17 OF 32
Mine Clearing
55.   Because of the urgent nature of the Project, procurement for the mine clearing program
will follow the expedited procurement procedures developed for emergency projects in BIH. Works
will cover contracts for clearing mines in specified areas. All works for mine clearing will be
procured through ICB (with no preference margin for domestic firms.)
56.   Mine clearing equipment will be financed through ICB, NCB  and LIB. Limited
International Bidding (LIB) that is, tendering by invitation, will be used to finance specialized
mine detection equipment, such as protective clothing, which is only available from a limited
number of suppliers worldwide. The list of LIB bidders will be based on expressions of interest
received in response to the GPN as well as other sources, including the direct experience of the
implementing agency. For goods under mine clearing component, about three packages totaling
$4.2 million will be financed through ICB, two totaling $3.2 million by NCB and about four
packages totaling $6.0 million by LIB.
57.   In addition, for the mine clearing component, consulting services will be used for training,
mine surveys and mine awareness programs consisting of about four packages with an aggregate
value of $0.7 million. Consulting Services will be procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines.
Procurement Review and Use of Standard Bidding Documents
58.   The Bank will conduct a prior review of procurement documentation for all ICB, LIB, DC,
for first two NCB packages, in accordance with paras. 2 and 4 of Appendix I of the Bank's
guidelines. Procurement documentation for contracts with consulting firms procured competitively
and exceeding US$ 200,000 per contact will also be subject to the Bank's prior review. For
consultants hired as individuals (rather than through companies) the prior review threshold will be
US$ 50,000. Follow up assignments will be permissible to the extent that this is indicated in the
initial terms of reference for the assignment.
59.   The Bank's standard bidding documents will be used, although the period allowed for
submission of bids may be reduced to four weeks. With regard to mine clearing works, the bidding
documents prepared for the Bosnian mine clearing program will be adapted for Croatia. For the
Bosnian prograrn, a section on requirements specific to landmine clearing was added to the bidding
documents with the technical specifications. The documents have been shown to OPR, in advance
of the requirement that will come into effect under the proposed Operational Guidelines for projects
that include financing for landmine clearing. OPR has cleared the documents for the Bosnian Mine
Clearing Project.
Retroactive Financing
60.   In order to accelerate the Project, the Loan will allow for retroactivc financing for up to
$17.5 million equivalent. Retroactive financing could be used for procurement within four months
prior to expected Loan signing, where such procurement followed Bank guidelines. Retroactive
financing will be used for reconstruction of the Sava River bridge at Zupanja-Orasje and repairs
and rehabilitation to the Lika rail line for amounts contracted prior to August 1, 1996.



TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 18 OF 32
Disbursements/Statements of Expenditure
61.    To facilitate timely Project implementation, MTTC and MOI will each establish, maintain,
and operate under conditions acceptable to tie Bank a special account in Deutsche Marks to be
held in a commercial bank, in the Central Bank, or with HBOR. The authorized allocations of the
special accounts will be limited to DM 19.3 million for the transport component's account and DM
10.4 million for the mine clearing component's account. Replenishment applications should be
submitted monthly, or more frequently as needed, and should be accompanied by reconciled bank
statements or other appropriate documentation.
62.    Disbursements will be made against Statements of Expenditure for: (a) goods and works
up to US$1 million equivalent (b) consulting services up to US$200,000 equivalent; (c) individual
consultants' services up to US$50,000 and (d) all training expenditures for which detailed

Accounts and Audits
65.    Separate and auditable Project accounts will be established by each of the implementing
agencies. The Project accounts will consist of: a record of all withdrawals with copies of
disbursement requests and supporting documentation, and a record of transactions of the special
account and the copies of the bank statements for the special account. Documentation for Project
accounts will be maintained for one year after the accounts had been audited.
66.    The Project accounts will be audited at the end of the Borrower's fiscal year. The audits
will be conducted by independent auditors under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.
Separate audit statements will be prepared for the special account and statements of expenditures.
All audit reports will be made available to the Bank no later than six months after the end of the
Borrower's fiscal year.
Reporting and Supervision
67.    The MMTC and the MOI will each prepare and furnish to the Project Coordinator a
quarterly progress report showing the status of implementation of the Project in a format
acceptable to the Bank. The Project Coordinator will consolidate the information presented by the
implementing agencies and submit to the Bank a consolidated report (as well as the reports from
the individual implementing agencies.) Project implementation will incorporate maximnum
flexibility in view of the fact that the Project may need to be adapted to changing circumstances.
Implementation progress will be reviewed at the end of 12 months after effectiveness, that is just
before the mid-term of the Project. The review will assess the need for any adjustments based on
the implementation experience to date. In light of the need for expedited implementation of the
Project, supervision missions will be conducted approximately every three months after
effectiveness.

MINE CLEARING AGENCY
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PROCUREMENT / IMPLEMENTATION ADVISER
Project Implementation
The Government will be responsible for the implementation of mine clearing policies and
programs within Croatia, and will carry out its mine clearing commitments through the Ministry of
Interior (MOI.) However the mine action programs will affect many other Government agencies,
specifically those responsible for the roads and railways networks. Although these agencies are
experienced in the World Bank's procurement procedures, the letting and implementation of
contracts for mine clearing is a specialized area, and MOI will become the focal point for the
letting, implementation and monitoring of all mine clearing contracts, whether carried out by
Croatian mine clearing agencies or specialized intemational companies.
Although the MOI has been tasked with setting up a structure necessarv to establish,
implement and monitor mine clearing programs, they have little previous experience in these
processes, and initially will need some guidance in the more specialized areas involved, such as the
letting of contracts, and the measures necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of the
contract, especially in the areas of maintenance of safety standards and Quality Assurance.
The exact method of contracting for mine and munitions clearing has not yet been
determined. There are two main options- the letting of clearing contracts centrally, or the letting of
contracts for clearing by the reconstruction company on whose behalf the mine clearing is being
carried out. Whichever option is chosen, advice will be sought from the MOI, either by the
agencies or the reconstruction contractors, and the MOI may still insist on the Quality Assurance
aspects of the clearing function being carried out under central arrangements, to ensure uniform
high standards of clearing.
Duties
As Procurement Adviser, the Consultant will be responsible for ensuring that the
procurement and implementation of all contracted mine and munitions clearing services are carried
out in a timely and effective manner, so that the clearing can be carried out in advance of contracts
for roads and railway reconstruction, and so that the reconstruction programs for these services can
be carried out without threat of mine and munitions hazard to the reconstruction contractor's staff
and equipment. The Consultant will report to the head of the MOI Project Unit responsible for the

NOTES ON MLNE CLEARING TECH NIQUES AND TECHNOLOGY
Mine Clearing Capacity
There are several sources from which mine clearers can be drawn. Each has advantages
and disadvantages:
M Military teams: Local militarv teams have been conducting mine clearing since the
conflict, but their utility is often problematic because donors and reconstruction
program managers have little control over military cleanrng priorities and standards.
Donors and aid organizations in general are reluctant to fund military organizations.
Military teams are, in general, experienced in laying mines or in breaching minefields
but do not have experience in clearing mines to a high standard (to humanitarian or
civilian standards), and this has caused accidents. Nor do they have any incentive to
clear mines to a high standard without receiving additional pay. Difficulties in
monitoring military operations is also a consideration.
*  Police and civil defense: these have an important and continuing role in responding to
emergency calls for assistance, especially in situations involving an isolated mine or
unexploded bomb. Civil defense teams have usuallv operated on a volunteer basis
through the war, and typically need to return to their normal employment after the war.
*  Commercial mine clearing companies: commercial mine clearing organizations are
typically formed in response to the large-scale need for mine clearing as a result of
protracted hostilities. Several such companies exist internationally, with experience
developed in Angola and/or Cambodia, for example, but they vary in experience and
competence.
*  Explosive ordnance disposal teams: In Croatia, some local commercial specialized
companies were still carrying out disposal activities from time to time on WWII
ordnance, but large-scale mine clearing requires a different organizational approach
from unexploded ordnance, for which additional training is necessary.
*  Non-governmental organization (NGO) mine clearing teams: NGO mine clearing
teams have considerable experience, and may be willing to assist in mine clearing
programs, and can often (but not always) offer lower prices, because of voluntary or
donor countrv contributions. They tend to be familiar with civilian (humanitarian)
clearing requirements, and can design their programs to train and use local personnel;
but they operate on a smaller scale than commercial companies.
*  Local "developmental" mine clearing capacity: A local capacity, trained in civilian
mine clearing standards, is essential to address the wide-scale and long-term needs of
Croatia. Although this capacity may not initially be sufficient to address the most
immediate needs, it is important that international assistance focuses on local
management and training from the beginning, so that local teams and companies can
play an increasing role as the overall mine clearing program is developed.

Mine Detection Methods
The choice of technology depends on the task, and no method is effective for clearing all
mines. In practice, several methods of mine clearing may be used, and several methods of detection
used in sequence to improve coverage.
Manual probing: Due to the preponderance of non-metallic or minimum metallic
mines throughout the former Yugoslavia, the primary mine detection is -mine probing"
supplemented by magnetic mine detection. This involves the insertion of a lightweight
mine probe or prodder into the ground, at an angle of 300, to a depth of 100 mm.
repeated every 3 cm across the area being searched. The operator uses the probe to
feel for hard objects buried under the surface. The insertion angle of 300 is intended to
minimize the risk of the operator inadvertently pressing on the top of the mine. A
trained mine clearer can expect to clear about 2m2 per hour using this method.
* Mine sensing dogs: Dogs can be trained to react to the smell of explosives, thus
indicating the presence of mines. In mine clearing, the primary use of dogs is to screen
large areas very quickly. and allow mine clearers to focus operations on the areas
where the dogs indicate the presence of mines. The dogs require skilled handlers who
are able to interpret their signals and maximize their limited endurance. Mechanical
enhancements to dog-detecting operations are increasingly becoming available (e.g..
collecting samples of materials, with the location of the samples recorded. and then
using dogs to detect the presence of explosives). Vapor emission detection systems
have also been developed, but none vet have the sensitivities of a trained dog.
-  Satellite or aerial photography: Detection of mined areas depends on the
identification of systematic or unusual disturbance of the earth. This method is only
effective for identifying relatively recent disturbances in open countrv. Ground
verification is required: and within the mined area, individual mines still need to be
located. No system has yet been demonstrated that will successfully detect mines in the
Croatian environrment.
Mine Clearing Devices
* Mechanical clearing devices, such as flails are rarely able to guarantee a level of
clearing greater than 80%. Although thev offer fast coverage, they require skilled
operators and are greatly affected by the type of terrain they encounter. They may be
used in support of manual clearing operations, but may not, on their own, provide the
necessary level of clearing. For example, mechanical methods may be used as a
proving (testing or verification) method in areas where mines are suspected, as part of
the quality assurance process after manual clearing operations, as part of a route
clearing operation, or to clear vegetation before manual clearing.
* Explosive clearing devices, such as fuel-air explosives or explosive hoses, have a
limited effective range and a large explosive area, they can damage infrastructure in
the mined area, and are difficult to deploy in areas covered by vegetation or rocks, or
in built-up areas. Their effectiveness is greatlv reduced when deployed against blast-



Attachment 7 page 3 of 4
resistant mirnes. They are therefore regarded as breaching devices and are not
considered suitable for use in normnal civilian operations. They are also several orders
of magnitude more expensive than manual clearing.
* Mine protected vehicles are not clearing devices, but are a valuable asset to mine
clearing operations. particularly to reconnaissance parties attempting to assess the
extent of mined or possibly mined areas. They can also transport goods and personnel
over routes which may be mined, thus facilitating reconstruction even while demining
is taking place. As such, they are valuable life-saving equipment for those operating in
mine contaminated areas.
* Other methods. Other devices mav be appropriate where the potential user can
demonstrate that the equipment can achieve the necessary level of clearing.
Considerable research and development needs to be undertaken to identify and develop
faster means of detecting the presence of minimum metallic mines; at present, no such
technology is yet suitable for field use. Any proposal for the use of new technology
needs to be accompanied by substantial proof that it is capable of reaching the
minimum clearing standard for civilian mine clearing operation.
Mine Clearing Standards
- Military mine clearing. Many soldiers (particularly field or combat engineers) are
trained in minefield breaching operations. carried out to -'punch a hole" through a
minefield during combat. A minefield breach is normally carried out in support of an
immediate tactical objective. and mav involve a situation where the local commander
judges that the risk of breaching the minefield, with whatever resources are available,
is necessary in view of the tactical aims -- given that minefields, like other military
obstacles, are often covered by defensive fire under such circumstances. A minefield
breaching operation mav result in significant casualties among the conducting troops
or subsequent users. Mine breaching techniques are designed for speed, and often
merely push mines aside without destroying them. Thev are therefore rarely suitable
for civilian mine clearing operations.
* Civilian (humanitarian) mine clearing standards. For civilian use of land, there is no
-acceptable" level of residual landmine contamination. However, although 100%
clearing is the objective of all civilian mine clearing efforts, a total guarantee that all
the mines have been removed will never be given by any reputable mine clearer. The
UN advocates that humanitarian mine clearing operations should aim to achieve 100%
clearing, with a minimum standard "in excess of 99% clear." At present, the only
method capable of providing this level of clearing is manual clearing using mine
probes supported (but not replaced by) mine detectors and sniffing dogs. The other
military or mechanical methods described above may be used to complement manual
mine clearing, particularly in survey or "proving" operations intended to establish
whether mines are present. They should not be regarded as primary means of mine
clearing.



Attachment 7 page 4 of 4
Quality Assurance
Mine and munitions clearing must be done with great thoroughness, to prevent mines or
munitions being missed during the clearing process, which could result in tragic accidents, and a
collapse of confidence in the value of the work done. No mine clearing organization can ever
guarantee that all mines and munitions have been removed, but the establishment of a strict Quality
Assurance (QA) regime can do much to ensure that clearing is carried out to the highest practical
standards. It also maintains pressure on the clearers to work to high standards. QA should be built
into every mine clearing program. It usually takes place at three levels; before the work begins, the
QA authority studies the clearing proposals put forward by the clearing organization, and looks at
their Standing Operational Procedures (SOPs) and safety regulations. If these are inadequate, they
either have to be corrected, or the contractor is not selected. At the second level, QA is carried out
at the work site to ensure that the organization is carrying out its operating procedures properly
and thoroughly. This involves watching the progress of the clearing, and the actions of the clearing
management staff. At the third level, samples of the cleared areas are re-inspected. If any mines or
munitions are found, the area will be declared insufficiently cleared, and the clearing done again at
the contractor's expense. Should many mines be found, the contract may be terminated due to the
contractor's poor workmanship. The QA requirements have to be built into the contract, and
agreed with the contractor before the contract is signed. The QA has to be done by a totally
independent agency. A contractor can be used, provided that this contractor has no other
contractual commitments in the country.

LESSONS FROM MINE CLEARING PROGRAMS
I      Large scale civilian mine clearing is comparatively new. Clearing after World War II was
done sporadically in several countries, often by soldiers. The end of the cold war allowed the world
to look at the mine contamination conditions in Afghanistan, Cambodia, and several countries in
Africa and Latin America, and to establish civilian programs to deal with them. The first major
program was set up by the United Nations in Afghanistan, where mine clearing started in early
1990 The clean-up after the Gulf War in 1991 and 1992 brought major civilian contractors into
the mine clearing business, and many lessons were leamt during this period. These have been
confirmed or modified as a result of other programs in Mozambique, Somalia. Rwanda. El
Salvador and Angola. Although the mine problems and their solutions have been unique to each
country, the fundamental principles remain the same.
2.     Mine Clearing by Soldiers. It is tempting to assume that, because soldiers lay mines
easily, they should be able to remove them with equal facility. The lessons of the past indicate that
unfortunatelv this is not the case. Removing mines requires a different order of discipline, training
and equipment to carry out large-scale humanitarian mine clearing, which is (or should be) more
like an industrial process than its military counterpart, minefield breaching. Soldiers tend to hurry
the mine clearing process. which usually results in casualties. Soldiers can be trained in civilian
mine clearing methods, and regiments of Bangladeshi, Egyptian, and Pakistani soldiers wvere
trained in Kuwait. It has been found that ex-soldiers, who have chosen to make their living clearing
mines are often more mature. and make better mine clearers.
3.     Mechanical Mine Clearing. Every mine clearing program has searched for a mechanical
solution to the mine clearing problem, the circumstances in Kuwait should have been ideal for such
a solution. In fact, the lessons of Kuwait, and other programs, have shown that hand clearing is
still the only trulv thorough method of mine clearing. There is no shortage of ideas for new
techniques and technologies, but most of these fail to take fully into account the destructive energy
of an anti-tank mine. They also tend to assume that mines always work according to their design
parameters. Mines, however, become unreliable and unpredictable, which increase their danger,
and the difficulty of finding a safe and reliable method of clearing them.
4.     Management and Administration. The lesson that has been repeated in almost all
programs is that a capability in mine clearing alone is insufficient. The mine clearing capability has
to be backed by capable and experienced managed and sound administration. Many small mine
companies ceased operations in Kuwait because or poor management and the resulting accidents. It
is difficult to eradicate all accidents, because, ultimately, during the clearing process, a mine
clearer has to deal directly with the mine, and many accidents are due to the human failings of
inattention, lapses of discipline, or lapses of memory.
5.     Support Systems. Another lesson of experience is the folly of rushing into a clearing
program, without proper attention to the medical, communications, casualty evacuation and
support systems that have to be in place before the first mine clearer steps into a minefield. These
preparations take time, but cannot be ignored or set aside in the interest of more rapid action.



Attachment 8 page 2 of 2
6.     Enhancing Local Capacity. It is also essential to think in detail about how local capacitv
is to be created and supported. It has been found that setting up an organization to train mine
clearers is only part of the problem. More important is establishing the management organization
that will deploy them after training. In three major programs, more students were trained than
could be employed; manv drifted into other jobs, so their skills were lost. Others needed expensive
re-training before they could be employed in mine clearing. Setting up a mine clearing capacitv
therefore requires detailed planning and careful coordination of training and employment
opportunities. This, in turn, means identifying and scheduling mine clearing priorities and, at the
same time, securing adequate funding (including fitting cash flows to the priority schedule) from
donors, loans, and other sources.
7.     Risks and Public Perception. The lessons of the past six years have shown that until
successful new technologies for mine detection and clearing can be developed (which will require
substantial funding), mine clearing will continue to be a slow, dangerous, and expensive business.
Any mine clearing program faces the probability that there will be fatal or serious accidents, which
will spark criticism from those who are divorced from the problem. However, there is less likely to
be criticism from those whose lives are endangered by the mines, or whose access to utilities,
services, shelter, or employment is curtailed by mine contamination.
