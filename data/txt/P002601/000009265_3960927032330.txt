MEHORANDU1( AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SUDAN
FOR A SOUTHERN KASSALA AGRICULTURAL PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed development credit to Sudan for
SDR 15.6 million (US$20 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.  The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and
help finance a Southern Yassala Agricultural Project. The project would be
cofinanced with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) which would provide a grant of US$10 million equivalent.
2.       Background.  Agriculture contributes significantly to Sudan's
economy. It accounts for about 34Z of GDP, supplies virtually all exports,
employs 70X of the labor force and provides most of the raw materials for
industrial activity. Rainfed agriculture is practiced on about 80? of all
agricultural land, generating about 65% of crop and livestock output, about
half its potential. The Government of Sudan 'GOS), with IDA support,
formulated a strategy in 1986 for the development of the rainfed sub-
sector. This str.- egy calls for institutional strengthening, improved
supply of agricultural services and inputs, improved farm technology,
resource conservation, improved infrastructure, bette;r marketing and
pricing systems, and increased public and private investment in rainfed
areas.
3.       The project would focus on rainfed farming in Southern Kassala
Province (population 750,000, including 200,000 refugees). It is an area
vital to the country's food security and export earnings, accounting for
about 35X and 20%, respectively, of the national sorghum and sesame
production. In the past, expansion of mechanized farming accounted for
most production increases. Declining yields, together with increasing
scarcity of land due to local and refugee population growth and serious
environmental degradation, have highlighted the need for policies
emp'.asizing intensification of farming and better environmental management.
Agricultural sector analysis and relevant Bank experience support these
policies and have identified the following major constraints to their
implementation: (i) unavailability of agricultural services and inputs;
(ii) inadequate environmental management; (iii) limited water supply; (iv)
poor road infrastructure; and (v) weak agricultural institutions. The
project design incorporates experience gained from on-going IDA rainfed
projects in Western Savannah and Southern Kordofan, as well as other donor-
financed projects at Nuba Mountains, Kordofan and Kassala. The project
would initiate implementation of the Bank/UNHCR policy of cooperation in
Africa towards economic self-reliance and development for refugees in the
impacted areas. GOS and IDA are increasingly aware of the magnitude of the
environmental problem, and the project focuses on actions to be taken to
arrest ecological damage, particularly in activities under research and
extension and the forestry component.
4.       Project Obiectives.  The project would have the following inter-
related objectives: (i) increased crop and livestock production on a
sustainable basis; (ii) improved environmental management; and (iii)



- 2 -
greater economic self-reliance of refugees. Production would be increased
through project components directed toward higher crop yields and higher
livestock off take and better infrastructure. Environmental improvements
wculd result from project components supporting land use planning and
monitoring, sound farming practices, reforestation and forest management.
Refugees would be supported through employment generation.
5.       Proiect Components.   (i) Agricultural services and inputs,
including applied research, extension, plant protection, and improved seed
and seedling distribution would be strengthened to increase yields, and
improve crop quality; (ii) Environmental management, including preparation
of a land use plan, natural resource monitoring, and forestry development;
(iii) Rural water supply would be improved through strengthening of the
Rural Water Corporation (RWC), ground water survey and monitoring, and
rehabilitation of water points for people and livestock; and (iv) Rural
road network would be upgraded to facilitate input distribution and
agricultural marketing. Within the framework of the components above the
project would promote the economic well-being of refugees by: (i) providing
agricultural services and infrastructure improvements; (ii) helping restore
natural resources and infrastructure which have deteriorated due to the
large refugee presence; and (iii) generating employment. These objectives
are consistent with UNHCR and GOS policies for refugees. The total cost of
the project is estimated at US$34.4 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$18.6 million (54X). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Sudan are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A
map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7385-SU, dated
October 12, 1988, is also attached.
6.       A Project Management Unit (PMU) has been created to coordinate
project activities and to strengthen the capacity of the Implementing
Agencies (IAs) in planning, financial management, procurement, monitoring
and evaluation. Project activities would be implemented by the Regional
Ministry of Agriculture, the Agricultural Research Corporation, the RWC,
and the District Councils (for rural road maintenance). The PMU and the
IAs would be supported through improved management and financial systems,
(including cost recovery), staff recruitment, training, studies, equipment,
and technical assistance. A Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance is
being used to assist with project start-up.
7.       Project Rationale and Rationale for IDA Involvement.  During the
mid-eighties the economy deteriorated substantially and the GOS responded
with partial measures which failed to provide significant improvement. In
late 1987 the GOS, with Bank and IMF assistance, initiated comprehensive
macro-economic policy reforms aiming at demand management, deregulation of
the economy and increased production and exports. On this basis the GOS
prepared a four-year (1988-91) development plan centered on agriculture as
the major source of growth. This project, along with other projects, would
help underpin the supply response to Sudan's policy reforms. It would
promote IDA's strategy to develop sustainable rainfed agriculture and
improve the environment. It would complement IDA-supported projects in the
Southern Darfur and Southern Kordofan rainfed areas and would benefit from
lessons learned there with respect to technological packages, environmental
management, infrastructure development, institutional strengthening and
operational sustainability. Under the project these lessons would be



refined further for possible replication in similar areas. The project
would, in parallel, help implement Bank policy of assisting UNHCR to
promote the economic development of refugees.
8.       Agreed Actions. (1) Current pesticide use is not cost-effective
and could be environmentally hazardous. All pesticides procured under the
project would be approved by the Association. (2) IAs have been
constrained by lack of funds. The GOS assured IDA that cost recovery
mechanisms would be instituted for inputs and services provided through the
project. Specifically, wateryard charges would be gradually raised to
cover operating costs by project year 3 and full costs by project year 6;
charges for improved seed and seedlings would be raised to full cost in the
first year of the project and those for crop protection services would be
raised to full cost by project year 3. (3) IAs are weak and lack the
capacity to implement the project. The GOS has established the PMU and
would maintain it for the duration of the project to coordinate project
activities and build up capacity in the IAs. A Project Director has been
appointed to expedite project start-up activities. As Conditions of
Effectiveness, Government would have met the conditions of the UNHCR grant,
have appointed a financial controller in the PMU and established posts for
senior extension and research officers.
9.       Justification and Risks.  Economic benefits under the project are
expected from: (i) increased crop, livestock and horticultural production;
(ii) improved water supply; (iii) better marketing; (iv) employment
generation; (v) forestry development and environmental protection; and (ii)
reduced vehicle operating costs due to road improvements. Beneficiaries
would consist primarily of traditional farmers and refugees. Possible
risks include: inadequate economic management by the GOS; difficulties in
staffing the PMU and implementing agencies; weak management of the
implementing agencies; administrative and procurement delays particularly
at start-up; and adverse climatic conditions. Recent comprehensive GOS
reforms supported by the Bank would help improve economic conditions. To
minimize project-specific risks, key start-up activities and initial
procurement would be funded through a PPF. Incentives would be provided to
attract qualified staff, training would be emphasized and technical
assistance would be made available. The PMU would have strong monitoring
capabilities and would provide hands-on assistance to the implementing
agencies. The research, extension and environmental components would help
reduce the effects of adverse climatic conditions.
10.    - Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit and the administration of
the UNHCR grant by the Association.
