TURKEY
FIFTH STRUCTURAL ADJUSTNENT LOAN
Loan Summary
Borrower            :    Republic of Turkey
Loan Amount               US$376 million equivalent in various currencies
(including the capitalized front-end fee).
Terms               :    17 years including 4 years' grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Description          :    The proposed loan would be the fifth in a series of
loans to support the Government's structural
adjustment program initiated in January 1980. The
principal aim of the program is to redirect the
Turkish economy towards a development path placing
more reliance on r.arket forces and outward-
orientation. The measures to be taken in this phases
of the program are outlined in the Government's
Statement of Development Policies - 1984, and fall
into two main categories:
(a)  At the macroeconomic level, the program includes
the development of a medium-term framework
consistent with the ongoing structural adjustment
programn, continued rationalization of public
inlvestmnent, further import liberalization, and
installation of a computerized debt management
system;
(b)  At: the sectoral level, the program includes the
implementation of measures to address structural
issues in the financial sector and preparation of
action plans for the agriculture and energy
sectors.
The loan would finance all imports with the exception
of items financed by other sources, military or
para-military items, luxury goods and nuclear reactors.
Risks               ;    The main risks arise from uncertainties in the
external environment, including adverse developments
in the growth of trade, and internal factors which
might impede the Government's determination to carry
out the structural reforms designed to restore
domestic and external financial equilibrium,
rationalize investment and lay the foundation for
sustainable growth over the medium term.



- iv -
Estimated
Disbursements    :    The proceeds of the lcan would be disbursed in two
tranches, $250 million equivalent soon after
effectiveness, and the remaining $126 million
equivalent after a performance review to be held in
January 1985.



INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED FIFTH STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Fifth
Structural Adjustment Loan to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of
US$376 million to support the Government's program of structural reforms
designed to restore financial equilibrium and achieve sustainable growth. The
loan would have a term of 17 years including 4 years of grace, with interest
at the standard variable rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       An economic mission visited Turkey in June 1982, and its report
entitled "Turkey: Country Economic Memorandum, Recent Economic Developments
and Medium-Term Prospects" (No. 4287-TU) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in June 1983. The report, in addition to analyzing Turkey's
medium-term prospects and overall creditworthiness, presents a synthesis of
earlier special economic reports on aspects of Turkey's adjustment process.
The report of the mission to review the financial system, entitled: "Turkey.
Special Economic Report - Policies for the Financial Sector" (No. 4459-TU),
was distributed in September 1983. An economic mission visited Turkey in
January 1984 to review the economic developments of 1983, the 1984 Annual
Program and selected structural adjustment issues. The findings of the
mission are reflected in this report.
3.       Turkey is about as large as France and Germany combined, with a
population of around 46 million and an estimated GNP per capita of $1370 in
1982. The density of population is low (78 per square kilometer of
agricultural land), and about 45 percent live in urban centers. Population
growth (2.2 percent per annum) is below the median for middle-income
countries. Despite rapid economic growth in the mid-1970s as well as
substantial emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more recently, to the
Middle East), the employment situation has deteriorated steadily with an
unemployment rate currently estimated at about 19 percent. There is, howev,er,
little or no absolute poverty, although income distribution is skewed. There
are considerable regional differences in income and large rural-urban
disparities. Recent data indicate a probable worsening in income
distribution, especially of wage and salary earners, and a sharp real decline
in average earnings. Educational enrollments have expanded greatly but the
level of adult literacy remains relatively low.

4.       Agriculture is an important sector in the economy, even though its
relative importance is declining. It corntributes 18 percent of GDP (1983),
employs about 51 percent of the labor force, and provides about a third of
merchandise exports (excluding processed food). Turkey is one of the very few
developing countries which is self-sufficient in food.  As a result of the
major emphasis of past development strategy on rapid industrialization, the
industrial sector today accounts for 27 percent of GDP and nearly 64 percent
of exports (mainly textiles, processed foods, and leather products), but only
10 percent of the labor force. The private sector is dominant in exports and
accounts for some 85 percent of exports. Turkey has large underdeveloped
energy resources (hydropower and lignite), but little petroleum. Energy
consumptipn has grown in line with GDP, but remains below the per capita
average for middle-income developing countries.  Crude oil imports accounted
for over 86 percent of consumption and cost about $3.2 billion in 1983,
equivalent to about 56 percent of exports. The energy situation remains a
major preoccupation of the Government, and investments in energy absorb the
largest share of the public investment program.
5.       During the 1970s Turkey did not make the necessary adjustments to the
shocks caused by the steep rise in oil prices, stagflation in the OECD
economies, and the consequent deterioration in the terms of external trade.
Turkey maintained high rates of economic growth by raising the share of
investment in GDP. This was financed initially by workers' remittances and,
following the quadrupling of oil prices, increasingly by short-term
borrowing. The rapid growth came to an abrupt halt in 1977 as the massive
external debt burden led to a sharp deterioration in creditworthiness, severe
shortages of imports, and disruptions in industrial production with a rise in
unemployment. By the end of 1979, domest;ic inflation had also become an issue
of critical importance. It was not until January 1980 that the Government
launched a policy of structural adjustment placing greater reliance on market
forces and on outward orientation.
6.       The implementation of the adjustment ;program was carried out by a
military regime which assumed power in September 1980 following a period of
sustained unrest. Subsequently a Consultative Assembly was set up to draft a
new constitution, which was overwhelmingly endorsed in a nationwide referendum
in November 1982. New election and party laws were then promulgated, and
parliamentary elections completed in November 1983. A new Government formed
by the Motherland Party assumed office in. Decemnber 1983. In the municipal
elections held in March 1984 the Motherland Party obtained a renewed mandate,
despite being opposed by five parties comtpared with the two which opposed it
in the parliamentary elections.
PART II - THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROCESS, 1980 - 1983
7.       The Government's program for restructuiring the economy seeks to
replace an industrialization strategy based on import substitution with one
with an outward orientation, by stabilizing the economy while laying the
foundation for sustainable growth over the medium term,  The program includes
the following main features-.
(i)   a realistic and flexible exchange rate;
(ii)   incentives to encourage producers to export;



- 3 -
(iii)   tight monetary conditions to restrain domestic demand and control
inflation;
(iv)   improved external debt: management;
(v)   deregulation of iLnterest rates to encourage private savings;
(vi) improved institut:ional efficiency in key sectors;
(vii)   rationalization of the public investment program;
(viii)   reform of the State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) to reduce their
burden on public finances and improve their efficiency; and
(ix)   progressive liberalizattion of imports including the elimination
of quantitative restrictions and the rationalization of the
tariff structure.
8.       From the outset it was clear that the structural adjustment process
would be a longer term effort., as it represented a fundamental change in
attitudes, institutions and po)licies.  Until the end of 1983 the Government's
approach had been to proceed on a year-by-year basis, setting targets in the
annual programs in line with t:he overall objectives. However, beginning in
1984, the Government intends to develop its own mediumr-term framework. The
formulation of the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89) during the
course of this year will enable the Government to chart the further course of
the structural adjustment process according to a consistent and better
quantified set of medium-term objectives.
9.       Judging by the progress made between 1980 and 1983, the Turkish
economy has shown an impressive response to the structural adjustment
program. Until 1982, actual performance met or exceeded the Government's own
targets.  The reform program was strictly adhered to, and most fiscal and
monetary targets in the stabilization program were met.  Major structural
reforms in the tax system, new import and export regimes, moves towards
economic pricing by SEEs, improvement in public investment, the liberalization
of interest rates, and the adoption of a daily fluctuating exchange rate, all
contributed to substantial short-term progress with favorable longer-term
implications. After two consecutive years of decline, real GNP grew in 1981
and 1982 by 4.1 percent and 4.6 percent respectively. The growth was due
primarily to significant improvements in the foreign balance since the
stabilization program allowed for only slight increases in domestic demand.
The situation was reversed in 1983 when the growth rate slowed down to an
estimated 3.2 percent (Table I.) and total domestic demand increased by
4.3 percent with a negative contribution of coming from the foreign balance.
Nevertheless, the three year average growth was significantly better than that
achieved in the period before the launching of the SAL process.

10.      Growth in the productive sectors was uneven during the period,
although industrial growth on the average improved markedly over 1980.  1981
witnessed a 7.2 percent growth in industrial value added, followed by
4.6 percent in 1982 and 7.6 percent in 1983. Agriculture, by contrast, was
unfavorably affected by weather conditions in 1981 and 1983. Only in 1982 did
favorable rainfall patterns contribute to bumper crops and a significant
6.4 percent growth in value added. On the expenditure side, the rate of
growth of public investment at constant prices has been contained at an
average of 2.4 percent per annum during 1980-8:3, while the rate of growth of
private investment in real terms has improved systematically from
(-)17.3 percent in 1980 to 4.8 percent in 1983. Private manufacturing
investment, on which much of the export-oriented development depends,
similarly seems to be recovering from a real growth rate of (-)14.1 percent in
1980 to a more encouraging 1.0 percent in 1983.
11.       On the inflation front, the Government was able to reduce the annual
inflation rate, as measured by the wholesale price index, from 107.2 percent
in 1980 to 31.4 percent in 1983. Although progress was systematic until 1982
when the rate of price increase reached a low of 25.2 percent, 1983 witnessed
a resurgence of inflationary pressures. Prices; were fuelled by an expansion
of Central Bank credits to the private sector during the second half of 1983
to reduce the difficulties of some banks and enterprises, and a lowering of



- 5-
nominal deposit interest rates during the year in anticipation of a reduction
in the rate of inflation that did not occur. The new Government has placed
the highest priority on bringing about a substantial deceleration of the rate
of inflation as quickly as possible.
12.      Balance of Payments.  The current account deficit decreased from
$3.2 billion (5.6 percent of GNP) in 1980 to $1.1 billion (2.0 percent of GN]P)
in 1982 (Table 2). However, the balance of payments deteriorated in 1983,
with the current account deficit climbing to about $2.0 billion (3.4 percent
of GNP). Merchandise exports, which were originally programmed at
$6.8 billion, only reached $5.7 billion, while workers' remittances,
originally expected to reach $2.2 biLlion, fell short by $600 million. Export
volume, however, recorded an increase of about 14 percent, reflecting the
continued competitiveness of Turkish goods in European and Middle Eastern
markets. But for a drop of nearly 12 percent in export prices and
consequently a 6.1 percent decline in the terms of trade, the net results
would have been more positive. Nevertheless, on balance, the performance of
merchandise exports has been quite impressive over the 1980-83 period, rising
in dollar terms by 61.6 percent in 1981, 22.2 percent in 1982 and declining
only slightly (by 0.3 percent) in 1983.

13.        Export growth has been led by the mainufacturing sector and has
involved a distinct  shift in destination from the EEC countries  to the Middle
East (Table 3). Industrial exports, comprised primarily of processed foods
and textiles, expanded by 119 percent in 1981, 50 percent in 1982 and
7 percent in 1983, while the share of industrial exports in total exports rose
from 36 percent in 1980 to 64 percent in 1983. These results were achieved by
a combination of indirect (flexible exchange rate policy and import
liberalization) and direct (tax rebates, preferential credits) measures to
enhance the relative profitability of exports and offset the bias towards
producing for the domestic market. The flexible exchange rate policy was one
of the most important factors contributing to the growth of exports, together
with the penetration of Turkish products in M4iddle East markets. In 1983,
however, the share of exports to the Middle Elast dropped slightly from the
level reached in 1982 while their value in dollar terms decreased by about
4 percent.   This is directly traceable to the political developments  in the
region and the weakness in the international oil markets.

14.       By contrast, the lower than anticipated growth in merchandise imports
was mostly due to factors exogenous to Turkey. In value terms such imports
were up by 12.9 percent in 1981, down by 1.0 percent in 1982 and up again by
4.4 percent in 1983. The relative stability of merchandise imports in 1982-83
reflects price decreases in both oil and non-oil imports. On average the
price of imported oil decreased by 9.6 percent in 1982 and 10.6 percent in
1983. On the other hand, the recession in the Western economies during most
of the period 1980-83, and the slow growth of EEC countries in 1983,
contributed to lower than expected receipts of workers' remittances. This was
especially true in 1983 when remittances fell by nearly 29 percent. Overall,
the positive elements in the trade balance during the period tended to
compensate for the stagnation in the services accounts, except in 1983 when
the adverse price effects for Turkish exports compounded the adverse impact of
the decrease in workers' remittances.
15.      Public Finances.  Progress in the management of the Consolidated
Budget, by contrast to developments in the inflation and balance of payments
areas, has been consistent throughout the period. The net result has been a
retrenchment of the public sector and success in bringing expenditures more in
line with resources. Thus Government expenditures, which stood at
24.0 percent of GNP in 1980, fell to 19.4 percent in 1983 (Table 4). The
budget deficit, which stood at 4.6 percent of GNP in 1980, decreased to
1.4 percent in 1981, 1,2 percent in 1982 and finally 0.5 percent of GNP in
1983. 1983 was the first year in which the actual results were better than
the program target. Transfers to the SEEs as a percentage of GNP also showed
steady improvement, from 4.8 percent in 1980 to 2.5 percent in 1983.
Budgetary revenues, on the other hand, have been consistently below program
figures, with the result that in order to maintain a non-inflationary fiscal
policy, the Government has been forced to cut back on planned expenditures.

16.       SEE Accounts.  The Government succeeded in improving the profit to
GNP ratio of the SEEs from (-)0.5 percent in 1980 to 0.8 percent in 1982. In
1983 the ratio declined slightly t:o 0.4 percent, partly as a result of delays
in announcing price adjustments. This was ccmpensated, in terms of overall
financial performance, by a decrease in the ratio of SEE financing
requirements to GNP to 6.4 percent from its 1982 level of 7.1 percent
(Table 5).

This ratio has in fact shown steadly improvement throughout the 1980-83
period. The improvements in the SEE accounts, besides reflecting a more
flexible price adjustment policy, are directly related to the Government's
efforts to expose the SEEs more tc competition, to streamline their
organizational structure as well as their links to supervisory government
agencies, to encourage operational efficiency through the strengthening of
managerial autonomy, and finally to bring about better management of human and
financial resources. The aim of the Government continues to be increased
profitability and decreasing dependence on budgetary support for the SEEs'
investment programs.
17.      Public Investment.  Restraining the high rate of growth in public
investment is a major objective of the structural adjustment program. In real
terms, public sector investment declined by 3.7 percent in 1980, and then rose
by 9.4 percent, 2.2 percent and 1.7 percent in 1981, 1982 and 1983
respectively. Private real investment, by contrast, declined by 17.3 percent



- 9 -
in 1980, declined again by 8.8 percent in 1981, and then rose by 5.4 percent
in 1982 and 4.8 percent in 1983.. The aggregate figures show that the
Government has been able to continue to rationalize its investment program and
to lower on balance the public sector's dependence on external resources
(Table 6). Further details relating to the size, sectoral allocations and
composition of the program are presented in paras. 42-49 below.

18.      Assessment.  The structural adjustment process seemed to lose
momentum in the second half of 1.983, which may be explained by the
Government's preoccupation with the elections and its reluctance to take some
important decisions. But overall there is little doubt that Turkey made some
impressive gains during the period 1980-83 as a whole. It is clear from the
data presented in the preceding pages that the stabilization program is
yielding results, that export growth has been placed on a firm basis and that
a substantial measure of monetary and fiscal discipline has been introduced in
the management of the economy. There were factors exogenous to Turkey, such
as adverse price developments on the external front and a downswing in
agricultural production due to poor weather, which contributed to some of the
negative macroeconomic results. The new Government has moved swiftly to deal
with the loss of momentum. In Part III which follows it becomes clear how the
Government's resolve is being transcribed into a rigorous medium-term
framework for pursuing the structural adjustment process.
19.      From the outset it was recognized that the structural adjustment
process in Turkey would be a longer term effort, as it represented a
fundamental change in economic incentives and in the institutions to devise
and implement them. Significant progress has been achieved in the past four
years, but the task of restructuring is by no means over. The objective of
the present Government is to broaden and deepen the structural adjustment
process, building on the progress already achieved, and carrying through to
the sectoral and sub-sectoral level the approach that has worked successfully
in the area of macroeconomic policy. The proposed Fifth SAL should be viewed
as part of this longer adjustment process.

PART III - THE MEDIUM--TERM FRAMEWORK AND SAL V PROGRAM
Introduction
20.      The Government's Statement of Development Policies - 1984
(Annex IV-A), which serves as the basis for its request for a Fifth Structural
Adjustment Loan, propounds a medium-term framework which is compatible with
the objectives of the structural adjustment program. The policy actions
contained in the Statement fall inlto two main categoriest
(i)   Macroeconomic
-   Medium-Term Framework
-   The Revised 1984 Program
-   Public Investment:
-   SEE Reform
-   Import Liberalization
-   Export Incentives
-   External Debt Management
(ii)   Sectoral
-   Financial Sector
-   Agriculture
-   Energy
Each of these areas is discussed more fully below. As with previous SALs, the
SAL V program encompasses a number of decisions already taken, some in
process, and others that will need to be addressed during the course of the
program spanning 1984 and early 19S85. The main actions are also summarized in
matrix form (Annex IV-B).
The Medium-Term Framework
21.      The draft Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89), which will
serve as the Government's medium-term framework, is expected to be completed
by mid-1984 for submission to the Grand National Assembly. The Government has
decided to change the nature of its planning process, moving from the
traditional, more centralized framework to one which is indicative in nature.
This is in line with the Government's view that it must rely increasingly on
an efficient private sector as the engine of growth. The Government is also
keenly aware of the need to strengthen the links between the macroeconomic
strategy and the concomitant sectoral and subsectoral strategies. To this
end, it intends to make greater use of Joint planning committees as forums to
achieve intra public sector and public/private sector consensus.
22.      The Basic Strategy.  The Goverr,ment 'has reiterated in the Statement
of Development Policies that the basic theme of the Plan will continue to be
an outward oriented development strategy increasingly guided by market
forces. The Plan will define the respective roles of the public and private
sectors and will indicate through its quantitative targets what the



- 11 -
expectations are for each. The public sector will be expected to provide the
infrastructure required to allow the private sector to achieve its potential,
while the private sector will be encouraged to develop along the lines of
Turkey's comparative advantage.
23.      The central theme of Turkey's structural adjustment program is one of
reliance on sustained export growth over the medium term. The Plan will give
a clear signal to the private sector that the public sector investment program
is supportive in nature and consequently that its size will not lead to a
pre-empting of resources for the private sector.  The Government recognizes
that a strong revival of private investment is predicated on the control of
inflation, since its main policy objective in setting interest rates is to
provide a real rate of return on savings.  Thus at least the first year of the
Plan will reflect in its targets a continuation of stabilization as inflation
is reduced to a level which will make interest rates attractive enough to
encourage the growth of private investment. The Government clearly recognizes
that the adjustment process will involve shorter-term hardships, but that by
providing a sounder economic base the Plan will contribute significantly to
improvements in the standards of living of the population over the medium
term. The Fifth Plan is seen in, Turkey as a transition plan, a bridge between
stabilization and the return to Turkey's normal growth path.
24.      Key Targets of the Plan.  The Government has announced its intention
of preparing a Plan that does nct conflict with the aims of the continuing
structural adjustment process as well as its achievements to date. It is
premature to present too many precise figures since these will have to await
approval of the Plan by the Grand National Assembly. Nevertheless, the
Government has indicated its line of thinking on some of the key targets for
the period covered by the Plan (1985-89),
(i)   the average annual real rate of growth of merchandise exports is
projected to be in the 8-11 percent range; given the low base
from which the export drive started, and the Government's
commitment to the maintenance of a competitive exchange rate
together with a carefully designed set of trade incentives, this
target is in the Government's view both realistic and attainable;
(ii)   the size of the public investment program will be regulated by
the Government's ability to generate resources and therefore the
ratio of public sector borrowing requirements to GNP will decline
from the expected level of about 3.5 percent in 1984;
(iii)   the Governments sintention is to restore an approximate balance
between public and private fixed investment in the medium term;
given the public/private balance of about 60/40 in 1983, this
implies a growth rate for private fixed investment which is more
than double that of public fixed investment over the Plan period;
(iv)   the share of public fixed investment to be allocated to the
priority sectors--energy, 1/ agriculture, transport and
communications--wi].l be maintained on average at least at the
1/ Including electricity, petroleum exploration and refining, coal and
lignite mining, and pipeline!s.

level attained in 1983; within t:hese sectors, projects identified
as of high priority will receive the bulk of the allocations and
the Government will progressively withdraw from new investments
in manufacturing that can more efficiently be carried on by the
private sector;
(v)   under the above assuimptions, ancl with reasonable expectations
regarding external capital flows, the Government's target average
annual growth rate for the Plan period will be about 6 percent;
and
(vi)   the Government will not allow a situation in which the targeted
growth rate of GNP will need to be supported by annual gross
external capital requirements which would push the debt service
ratio 1/ significantly above the! 25 percent average envisaged for
the medium term.
25.      To summarize, the Governmnent intends to prepare a Plan that will be
consistent with the fight against inflation but which envisages a growth
strategy commensurate with its ability to generate resources. The Government
has emphasized that it would adjust its annual targets through its Annual
Programs should the projected resources fail to materialize during the course
of the Plan, to avoid jeopardizing the gains to date from the structural
adjustment process.
26.      The Bank's Medium-Term Projections.  The development of a medium-term
framework by the Turkish Governmenit is an issue that goes back to SAL III.
Both the Bank and the Government agreed then that the structural adjustment
process had to be placed within the boundaries of a medium-term framework, and
that the best mechanism for doing so would be through the Fifth Five-Year
Development Plan, which was originally scheduled to cover 1984-1988. The
drafting and adoption of the Government's Fifth Plan was expected to be
completed in 1983. The previous Government drafted a Five-Year Plan, but then
postponed its presentation to the National Assembly by one year to enable the
new Government to prepare its own medium-term program.
27.      Concurrently, the Bank produced its own medium-term projections in
the 1983 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM). 2/  These projections were
discussed in detail with Turkish Government officials during and after the
preparation of the CEM. Further discussions were held in January 1984 during
the Program Review Mission and again in March during the SAL V appraisal. The
dialogue on the question of Turkey's medium-term framework has thus been a
continuous one culminating in the Government's overall view of the medium term
as set out in the Statement of Development Policies - 1984. While less
optimistic than the views expressed in the Bank's CEM, for reasons that go
1/ Total debt service as a proportion of exports of goods and non-factor
services plus workers' remittances.

back to the loss of momentum in export growth in 1983 as well as the
resurgence of inflation, the current view from Turkey, in its broad aspects,
is corroborated by the Bank's own updating of its medium-term projections
based on developments in the second half of 1982 and 1983.
28.          The  Bank's  projections  for  the mediumrterm  take  as  their  starting
point the Government's own targets for the key macroeconomic variables. lhe
Bank attempted to disaggregate the Government's overall targets for the Plan
and to check whether these were in line with domestic and foreign resources.
The Bank's projections indicate the need for a continuation of the
stabilization program well into 1986, an average annual GDP growth of
5.8 percent in 1985-89 and a manageable balance of payments. Two central
assumptions underpin these projections, namely export sustainability and
fiscal discipline. Table 7 below presents the Bank's projections of the key
economic variables for the Fifth Plan period (1985-1989). Figure 1
illustrates the trends in selected indicators since 1980 and places the 1984
program in the context of the Bank's medium-term projections.

29.       These projections assume that the revised 1984 program for export
growth will be achieved and that in the base year of the Plan merchandise
exports will stand at $7.1 billion. 1/ Merchandise exports are projected to
grow at an average of 9 percent per annum in real terms, i.e. slightly on the
conservative side of the Government's 8-11 percent target range. Merchandise
imports, on the other hand, are assumed to grow moderately in real terms
through 1986 and then pick up to an average 8-9 percent in the terminal years
of the Plan, to match the projected growth rate of merchandise exports. On
these assumptions, the current account balance shows a decreasing deficit
through 1985 as stabilization policies act to curtail import growth while
encouraging exports. As higher growth rates set in during the middle of the
Plan period, the trend reverses and the current account deficit rises again
through the end of the Plan. The terminal year 1989 shows a deficit of
approximately $2.6 billion as compared to a 1985 figure of $1.2 billion. The
projected capital account should remain manageable throughout the projection
period even in the face of some sharp increases in the amortization and
interest payments in 1985-1986, arising from the debts rescheduled during the
1978-1982 period and the imposed constraint on foreign exchange reserves being
equivalent to at least two months' imports.  The debt service ratio should
average 24.5 percent for the Plan period with a maximum of 25.3 percent in
1986. Gross capital inflows required to support Turkey in 1985-1989, on these
assumptions, average about $4.8 billion per year. This inflow is consistent
with a decreasing debt service ratio from 1986 onwards.
30.       The projections indicate a GDP growth of 5.8 percent per annum on
average throughout the Plan period, with a low of 5.0 percent in the initial
year of the Plan and a high of 6.6 percent for the final year. The
achievement of these growth rates will depend on the growth of the productive
sectors, namely agriculture and manufacturing.  This in turn will depend to a
large extent on the Government's determination to constrain the growth of the
public sector in line with public resources and to create a more favorable
investment climate for the private sector through its anti-inflationary
policies and its restructuring efforts.
31.       The scenario assumes progressive improvements in the public/private
fixed investment ratio throughout the Plan period, from the initial 60:40
ratio in 1984 to a terminal year ratio of 53:47. This translates into an
expected real growth per annuin in public fixed investment of about
4.8 percent. The comparable ifigure for private fixed investment is about
10.0 percent, or a little more than twice the growth rate for public
investment.
32.       The medium-term scenario described here is of course, only one of
many possibilities and is used specifically in this report to illustrate
Turkey's potential in the light of the Government's own targets. The Bank
projections are consistent with the more conservative of the Government's
targets and they are reasonable given Turkey's record of structural
adjustment, the favorable responses from the international financial commlunity
to the new Government 's program ancd the present view of future resources and
1/ Merchandise exports during the first three months of 1984 totalled
$1,855 million, representing an increase of 36.5 percent in dollar terms
over the level achieved during the corresponding period in 1983.

export market possibilities. 1/ A scenario compatible with the upper ranges
of the Government's key targets would need to 'be supported by substantially
higher export growth rates and is difficult to envisage at this time, given
the transitional (stabilization-cum-growth) nature of the upcoming Plan.
33.      There are certain risks associated with the Fifth Plan targets.  On
the downside, with Turkey's export performance heavily dependent on exogenous
factors such as the world economic outlook and movements in international
prices, a slower rate of growth of merchandise exports, say 6-7 percent per
annum over the Plan period, would lead to a more difficult (but still
manageable) balance of payments situation, morie external borrowing, a lower
GDP growth (averaging about 4.5 percent per annum) and a higher debt service
ratio (26-27 percent per annum). In such a situation the Government would
have little chance of absorbing the unemployed and improving tangibly the
average standard of living. However, given thes Government's emphasis on
export promotion and the determined efforts to counter the bias towards
producing for the domestic market, the more baLanced perspective is the one
set out in the medium-term scenario presented above.
34.      The Government intends to review with the Bank the Fifth Five-Year
Development Plan before the release of the second tranche of the proposed
loan. Completion of the preparation of a Plan compatible with the aims of the
structural adjustment program, in terms of botlh its strategy and its targets,
would constitute a condition of tranche release (Loan Agreement, Schedule 5).
The Revised 1984 Program
35.      An official 1984 Annual Program was prepared by the previous
Government, but it needed revision to take account of the reform measures
introduced by the new Government soon after the latter took office. The main
structural measures in the new Government's program are:
(i)   a reorganization of the Government's administrative machinery
which, inter alia, concentrates authority over economic affairs
in the Prime Minister's office;
(ii)   a substantial import liberalization;
(iii)   a rationalization of export incentives;
(iv)   a liberalization of the foreign exchange regime;
(v)   an interest rate policy designed to provide a real rate of return
on savings while largely freeing lending rates set by the
commercial banks;
(vi)   a reduction in the financial transactions tax and the withholding
tax on interest payments; and
(vii)   a reaffirmation that with some exceptions, SEEs will be free to
set their own prices.
1/ See para. 102 below.

36.      The Government has placed inflation control and export growth at the
center of its 1984 program. Stabilization measures will need to be continued
at least through 1984 and prolbably into 1985 and 1986. GDP is targeted to
grow at 4.7 percent in 1984, representing an improvement over the 1983 levesl.
The impetus for this growth is expected to come from a better performance of
the agricultural sector with a growth target of 2.8 percent (versus
(&)0.3 percent in 1983), and from a continuation of the good performance for
value added in industry (6.3 percent in 1984 versus 7.6 percent in 1983). The
program calls for a target average inflation rate of about 29 percent. The
year-on-year rate, which was running at about 40 percent in December 1983, is
expected to be less than 25 percent by the end of 1984. Given the actual
developments in the first quarter of 1984, it appears likely that these
targets may turn out to be somewhat optimistic. This further highlights tlhe
need to pursue tight demand management policies throughout the year in order
to combat inflation in an orderly and progressive manner. 1/
37.      Significant improvement in the balance of payments is expected in
1984, with the current account deficit projected to decrease to about
$1.1 billion (2.4 percent of GNP) compared with $2.0 billion (3.4 percent of
GNP) in 1983, largely in response to a narrowing in the trade deficit and an
increase in workers' remittances. These results assume a growth of
approximately 25 percent in the value of exports (from $5.7 billion to
$7.1 billion) and a moderate 4.2 percent growth in workers' remittances, both
predicated on the continuing improvement in the industrial economies. Import
growth is expected to be moderate as in 1983 and is projected at 5.6 percent
after allowing for an increase in non-oil imports as a result of the recent
trade liberalization measures.
38.      The Government's central aim in the fiscal area is to continue to
reduce the ratio of public sector borrowing requirements to GNP. To this end,
the Budget Balance for 1984 is targeted to show a surplus of TL 45 billion or
0.3 percent of GNP, thereby continuing the trend of the last few years.
Expenditures, estimated at TL 2,825 billion or 18.0 percent of GNP, will be
more than matched by revenues. If revenues fail to register the planned
29 percent increase in 1984, expenditures will be pared accordingly as in
prior years. The declining ratio of public revenues to GNP remains a major
area of concern and the Government is making improvements in the system of
assessing and collecting taxes. For the SEE accounts, the latest estimates
following recent price increases indicate a profit to GNP ratio of 1.0 percent
in 1984 (versus 0.4 percent in 1983) and a financing requirement to GNP ratio
of 5.8 percent (versus 6.4 percent in 1983). Overall, the public sector
borrowing requirements are estimated to decline to 3.5 percent of GNP in 1984
(versus 4.8 percent in 1983).
39.      The aim of monetary and credit policy in 1984 will be to control
inflation and support the grcowth targets set out in the revised annual
program. Within the monetary constraints, priority will be given to credits
for the export sector. Interest rate policies will be periodically reviewed
to maintain a real rate of return on savings. Agreement has been reached with
1/ See also para. 98 below.

the IMF on the performance criteria of the monetary program through
April 1985, to serve as a basis for a new one-year Standby in the amount of
SDR225 million to run from April 1984. The Government is committed to a
flexible exchange rate policy, whic:h it has applied consistently since 1980,
because of its critical importance to the export drive and to Turkey's
medium-term outlook.  In 1983 the nominal effective exchange rate was
depreciated (on an average annual basis) by 22 percent in accordance with this
policy, resulting in a real depreciation of about 3.5 percent. In 1984, the
liberalization of foreign exchange transactions has so far resulted in a real
depreciation in excess of 6.0 percent.
40.       Of particular importance to the macroieconomic outlook for 1984 will
be the course of interest rates. Lending rates remain high in real terms and,
therefore, tend to hinder investments.  The Government's objectives in this
area are to:
(i)   increase the role of the market in the determination of interest:
rates;
(ii)   reduce the differences between the interest rates on preferential
and non-preferential credits; and
(iii)   encourage the availability of medium and long-term credits for
the productive sectors of the economy.
The Government is aware that only with a decrease in the inflation rate will
nominal interest rates decline and thereby lead to the growth of private
investment on which the medium-term prospects depend.
41.       The Government's revised 1984 program reaffirms the intention to
restructure the economy.  The reform measures are intended to widen the
process of economic restructuring. They provide the broad outlines of a
medium-term blueprint which will need to be quantified in the Plan. Each
year, the Government will undertake an annual review of economic performance
within the context of its medium-term projections as a basis for drafting its
next annual program.  This will ensure that the 1985 Annual Program, as well
as subsequent ones, will be compatib'e with the objectives of the Fifth Plan
and the aims of the structural adjustment process.
Public Investment
42.       The management of public investment presents one of the difficult
challenges for the Government's struictural adjustment program. The public
investment program in Turkey has traditionally been characterized by weakness
in project evaluation and preparation, resulting in a poor choice of projects
and underestimation of both investment costs and construction periods. This
led to the evolution of a public investment program whose size encroached on
private savings and whose composition was largely unrelated to sectoral
objectives. The redefinition of the role of public investment under the
structural adjustment program inclucdes as a basic medium-term objective the
restoration of an approximate balanc:e in the ratio of public to private fixed
investment (as against the 60:40 ratio that prevailed in 1983) and the removal
of physical and social bottlenecks to economic growth. In order to allow the



- 19 -
private sector to play its leading role in output, export and employment
expansion, it is the Government's objective to focus public investment on high
priority projects in infrastructure, with manufacturing being increasingly
left to the private sector. It is also the Government's objective that public
investment should increasingly be financed by public resources and, therefore,
that the ratio of public sector borrowing requirements to GNP should decline
over time.
43.      Over the last three years considerable progress has been made towards
rationalization of the public investment program. In particular, the size of
the program has been made more consistent with the available resources.
Public investment registered an average increase of only 2.4 percent per annum
during 1980-83 as against an average annual growth rate of 18.4 percent during
1972-77. This involved a much tighter control over implementation of the
program. No extra budgetary allocations have been made available to finance
public investment since the end of 1981. Further, the number of projects has
been reduced from over 9000 in 1980 to about 7400 in 1984. 1/ This involved
both the dropping of a large number of projects of unproven economic merit as
well as a decision not to include any new large projects in the program during
1981-83. The sectoral composition of public investment is also now in greater
harmony with the macroeconomic objectives. An increasing share of allocations
is being directed to infrastructure, especially energy, with substantial
reductions in allocations to manufacturing. However, the rationalization of
public investment must be viewed as a medium- to long-term process, and more
needs to be done to concentrate public resources on the most appropriate needs
while making available a greater amount of resources to the private sector.
These objectives are complementary, since the restoration of private
investment is dependent in large part on the availability of infrastructure
and essential inputs, such as power, adequate transport facilities and basic
materials, that can only be provided by the public sector.
44.      Size: Public fixed investment in 1983 is estimated at
TL 1314.4 billion at current prices.  In real terms, this represents a growth
of 1.7 percent from the level in 1982, and is a major achievement in
expenditure control. The 1983 estimates also show a reduction in the share of
public investment in total fixed irLvestment as compared to the two previous
years. This share is expected to decline in future years in line with the
Government's policy. Public investment in 1984 is expected to grow at
3.1 percent over the level achieved in 1983. Table 8 below shows the pattern
of public investment during the period 1980-84 as compared to the period
1974-78. With the increase in public savings from 5.2 percent of GNP in 1980
to 7.4 percent in 1983, the gap bet:ween public investment and public saving
has been progressively reduced, from over 10 percent of GNP in 1980 to
3.9 percent of GNP in 1983 (Table 6).
1/ These numbers are somewhat mis:Leading since many "projects", especially in
the social sectors, are programs which essentially represent current
rather than investment expendil:ures.

45.       Sectoral Composition:  The sectoral ccmposition of public investment
has undergone a significant change in the last four years. Most noteworthy is
the progressive increase in the allocations for energy, which represented
38.7 percent of total public fixed investment in 1983 (Table 9), reflecting
the Government's efforts to increase energy production. There has also been
an increase in the allocations for agriculture and transport from the
1980 levels. On the other hand, the share of manufacturing has dropped from
29.7 percent in 1980 to 18.1 percent: in 1983 and is expected to decline
further to 14.3 percent in 1984. Irn 1983 about 65 percent of the total
allocations were directed to rehabilitate and expand infrastructure
(irrigation 1/, energy, transport and communications), as contrasted with 1980
when only 57.1 percent of the allocations went to infrastructure. The 1984
Program maintains the same emphasis. Table 9 also shows how closely the
sectoral pattern of public investment in the 1933 Program compares with the
pattern for 1982-85 suggested in the Public Investment Review Report (PIR) 2/,
which called for increases in energy, agriculture and transport and a decline
in manufacturing. The share of manufacturing in 1983 is already below the
recommended level.
1/ Irrigation constitutes about 66 percent of total investment in agriculture.

46.        Project Composition:  The Government has assigned priority to
projects according to the following criteria:
(a)    those having high economic rates of return and capable of being
completed within a short period;
(b)    those which will help develop indigenous energy resources, and
rehabilitate or extend the infrastructure; and
(c)    those which help overcome output and export bottlenecks.
The 1982-84 Investment Programs reflect the application of these criteria. As
against only two projects completed in the irrigation subsector in 1980, for
example, 9 projects were completed in 1982 and 19 projects in 1983, while
25 projects are expected to be completed in 1984. In the power subsector, as
against no project completed in 1980, 5 projects were completed in 1982,



- 22 -
4 projects in 1983, and 3 major projects are expected to be completed in 1984,
including the Oymapinar and Aslantas projects that will generate a total of
678 MW of power. In all, the Government: completed 167 projects in the key
sectors (agriculture, manufacturing, energy, transport and communications) in
1983 and expects to complete 249 projects in these sectors in 1984. Moreover,
a number of large projects, the economic viability of which had not been
established, have been dropped, deferred for restudy or substantially reduced
in scope in the 1984 Program. Projects in this category (27 in all) are
expected to receive less than 2 percent of the total allocations for large
projects in 1984.
47.      The 1983 investment expenditures and the 1984 Program allocations
reflect a conscious effort to spee.d up the project completion rate by
focussing funds on a more limited number of projects. In 1983, over
96 percent of the funds allocated for large projects (each costing over
TL 7 billion) went to the 150 projects identified as of high priority. In the
1984 Program this share is still over 92 percent (Table 10).

48.      Although there has been some progress in the last three years, there
is scope for further improvement in the Government's capacity for project
preparation, evaluation, and selection. In addition, greater efforts are
required to improve the planning capabilities of the executing agencies. The
Government is trying to build up its evaluation capability primarily in the
State Planning Organization (SPO), supplemented by that in key agencies
including the State Investment Bank (DYB). The head of a reorganized project
evaluation unit in SPO was appointed in ;982 and the department is now in
operation. Staff from the Bank's Economic Development Institute (EDI) and DYB
jointly conducted a training course on power projects in January 1983 and
another on infrastructure projects in September 1983. Proposals are under
consideration for organizing further training courses of this type in Turkey
for Government and SEE staff as well as for instructors who could conduct
training courses in the future. Meanwhile, the regular training courses being
conducted by DYB will be strengthened.
49.      The Government recognizes that the project list is still not fully
satisfactory and expects to further rationalize it over the next several
years. The sheer size of the program, some 7400 ongoing projects costing
about $30 billion, means it can only be modified to a limited extent in any
single year. Despite a major effort to trim the program for 1983 and 1984,



- 23 -
considerable work remains to be done. The Government intends to take the
opportunity of the Plan preparation to undertake a detailed review of the
public investment program, especially the major projects, with the objective
of speeding up the completion of high priority projects and reducing or
eliminating the allocations to projects of lower priority, with parallel
improvements in planning capability and institutional performance.  The review
will also confirm that the size of the public investment program is compatible
with domestic and foreign resources, so that investment financing is
non-inflationary and within the debt servicing constraints. Satisfactory
progress in carrying out and implementing the results of such a review would
be a condition of tranche release (Loan Agreement, Schedule 5).
Reform of State Economic Enterprises
50.      Reform of the State Economic Enterprises has been a major goal of the
structural adjustment program. During 1980-82, the Government implemented a
number of measures to improve short-term financial performance, redirect the
SEEs' investment programs and finance them increasingly from non-budget
sources, and undertake legal reforms to institutionalize these changes. The
financial performance of SEEs registered substantial improvement as a result,
with a situation of chronic deficits changing into one of growing profits. In
1983, the Government passed a wide-ranging reform decree, whose purpose was to
introduce structural reforms with the overall objective of having a viable SEE
sector more responsive to market forces.  The ultimate goal is to place the
SEEs in an economic environment where they would compete with privte sector
firns, especially with regard to output prices, factor inputs, and credit.
The President's Report on the recent Technical Assistance Project for State
Economic Enterprises (Report No. P-3697-TU) contains a description of the main
provisions of the reform decree. The financial position of the operational
SEEs, including projections for 1984, is presented in Annex VI to this
report.
51,      The question of State Economic Enterprise reform has to be addressed
at sever21 lvels. These include:
(i)   the "environment" (economic, financial and political) in which
the SEEs operate;
(il'   the organizational structure of the SEEs and their links to the
Government;
(iii)   the operational and managerial efficiency of individual SEEs; aad
(iv)   the management of human resources in the SEEs, covering the areas
of motivation, monetary and non-monetary incentives, and training.
The progress achieved under these heads is discussed below.
52.      Tle Government has taken several measures to make the economic
environment of the SEEs more competitive and to grant them greater managerial
autonomy while simultaneously strengthening their financial structure.  Since
the passage of the SEE reform decree in May 1983, 1/ a review of the capital
structure of the enterprises has been initiated and capital increases have
l/ The reform decree was formally replaced by a law (Law 2929) enacted in
October -983.



- 24 -
been authorized in some cases. The outstancling debts of SEEs have been
consolidated and arrears to the Government converted into equity.  The SEEs
have been encouraged to exercise their freecom to set their own prices in the
light of market conditions and they have done so in a number of cases. Major
price changes were announced in :Late-1983 and March 1984. In future small but
more frequent changes in prices will be made. As a result of the continuous
improvement in the SEE accounts, budgetary transfers to SEEs in 1984 will be
reduced to TL 330 billion, which in real terms is about 14 percent less than
in 1983, and a further reduction is planned for 1985. The total financing
requirement of the SEEs as a percentage of GNP is also expected to decline in
1984. In the ultimate analysis, however, the most important development may
be the major movement on import liberalization, 1/ which by introducing
foreign competition will act as a spur to increasing enterprise efficiency.
The Government has stated its intention of prescribing target rates of return
for different categories of enterprises, especially manufacturing enterprises
and utilities, to serve as a basi's for monitoring their performance.
53.       As far as the organizati onal structure of the SEEs is concerned, the
Government intends to explore opportunities for converting selected SEE
activities into joint stock ventures by offering such stock to the public. A
review of the potential for selective privatization of the assets of SEEs is
proposed to be undertaken in 1984. Meanwhile, the Government has recently
enacted a law which provides for the sale of income-sharing bonds and shares
of SEEs to the public.
54.       The strengthening of management and upgrading of operational
efficiency in SEEs offers considerable scope for improvement in the short
run. The Government considers the time opportune, therefore, to shift from a
broad approach to SEE reform to a more differentiated one focussing on
individual enterprises.  It is the Government's intention to bring about
further improvement of operational efficiency in SEEs through management
strengthening, introduction of modern management techniques, and better
manpower planning and training. In addition to the pilot technical assistance
loan approved recently, several of the ongoing Bank-assisted projects include
components that address SEE operational efficiency issues. The Government has
also welcomed the Bank's proposal to work wii:h the railways in identifying
areas where the Bank can be of assistance. Other sub-sectors where the Bank
is planning lending operations to SEEs in the next 2-3 years include lignite,
power, and pulp and paper.
55.       The generally low level of personnel performance in the SEEs is a
difficult problem which can be solved only gradually. Raising salaries alone
is not sufficient, and in any event budgetary constraints would rule out any
large scale salary revision for SEE employees. Better manpower planning and
training are critical factors, and the Bank intends to continue to emphasize
their importance in project and sector lending. Work on the new personnel
regime for SEE employees is well advanced and it is expected that it will be
announced in the near future. Once this is clone, the Bank intends to work
with the SEEs to assist them to use effectively the flexibility in personnel
management that the new regime is expected to provide.

Import Liberalization
56.      The objective of opening up the Turkish economy to competition from
abroad is an essential component of the Government's structural adjustment
program. The Government's long--term policy is that import restrictions should
not be used to protect domestic producers. It is keenly aware that efforts to
reduce the effective level of protection and the bias towards domestic
production are essential to restructure the economy and stimulate competitive
exports to support growth. Nevertheless, because of entrenched domestic
forces dependent on protection and the persistence of international trade
restrictions, the Government recognizes that the process will entail
considerable effort at the political level. The Government's intention is to
shift from a licensing system of import control to one relying on tariffs and
to reduce these tariffs over the medium term.
57.      The Government took a series of legal and administrative steps to
liberalize the import regime during the last three years, including the
abolition of the quota list in 1981, and the shifting of over 225 items from
Liberalized List II 1/ to the more liberalized lists (List I 2/ and the Levy
List 3/), over the next two years. In addition, the Government allowed the
duty-free importation of inputs going into exports, and provided some
additional de facto liberalization by permitting imports of items domesticalLy
produced which were indirectly needed for exports or to keep domestic prices
down through competitive pressures. As part of the 1983 Import Regime, steps
were also taken to reduce the rates of import guarantee deposits and improve
procedures for extending the period of validity of import licenses.
58.      While the import liberalization measures undertaken were incremental
up to 1983, the Government announced a major structural change in the 1984
Import Regime. In effect while in the past the regime specifically defined
goods that could be freely imported and the ones whose imports required a
license, thus virtually prohibiting imports of all the goods not included in
any of the lists, the new regime defines prohibited and licensed imports and
ipso facto liberalizes imports of all other products. In 1983, the number o:f
imports requiring a license (Liberalized List II) totalled 821 items; in the
1984 regime these have been reduced to 369 items.  Total import authorizations
for items on the List II amounted to $5.2 billion in 1983; if the 1984 regime
had been applied, import authorization would have been needed for only about
$1.2 billion worth of these imports. When measured against total imports in
1983, the liberalization of 1984 is estimated to have affected approximately
60 percent of imports subject to licensing.
1/  Includes items which require an import license, issued normally if the
goods cannot be supplied locally in comparable quality and quantity, and
at a reasonable price.
2/  Includes items which are noncompetitive with domestic production and
freely admitted.
3/  Introduced in the 1982 Regime--includes items which can be imported
without restriction but are subject to a flexible levy that is adjusted
from time to time.



- 26 -
59.      Simultaneously with the removal of quantitative restrizLi. i : ;.z  . Yi a
number of items, the Government proceeded to a reduction in tariff  ices.  Out
of about 500 products whose tariffs were changed, more than 80 perceziz had
their tariff rates reduced.  Since the tariff adjustments affect inpDuts and
final products differently, there is a possibility that effective protection
may not have decreased in some instances.  Ihe structure of tariff rates for
products whose tariffs were changed is shown. in Table 11. In designi-nig the
new tariff structure, the Government adhered to the general principle that
nominal tariffs on basic materials should be in the 0-15 percent range,
tariffs on intermediate and semi--finished goods between 10 and 30 percent; and
tariffs on finished products between 30 and 40 percent.

licensed imports, the Government has also defined a "Fund" or levy List.
Goods on this list--which may either require a license or be freely
importable--are subject to a specific surcharge besides customs duty5 The
bulk of items included in this list are luxury consumer goods.  A sii2ai.atr list
existed in the past, but the scope of the newq levy list has been broadenied and
the levies have been raised. This appears to have been done in order to
soften the impact of a sudden removal of quantitative restrictions and
reduction. in tariffs on consumer goods on the balance of payments. 2/ Most of
the proceeds realized from the levies will be transferred to a fund for the
construction of low-cost housing. The Government has also introduced some
important changes in the trade regime between Turkey and the countr4es with

imports were also prohibited in the past.

- 27 -
nationalized foreign trade. Trade with these countries may be conducted only
by Turkish public sector agencies, and by private firms whose exports in the
preceding year exceeded $50 million. The decision is aimed at improving the
bargaining position of Turkey's exporters.
61.      Finally, the Government has effected an important administrative
reorganization of the official agencies dealing with imports. The licensed
list was previously administered by three Ministries (Commerce, Industry and
Technology, and Energy and Natural Resources), with each issuing licenses for
goods under its jurisdiction. In addition to obtaining an import license, the
importer had also to get a foreign exchange license (issued by the Central
Bank through the intermediary c,f a commercial bank). Under the new system,
all the authority on matters related to imports is centralized in the newly
formed Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade under the Deputy Prime
Minister. The Undersecretariat; now issues import licenses which
simultaneously include the right to purchase the foreign exchange, and decides
on all shifts of items between the lists (including shifts to and from the
"free regime"), and changes in tariff and levy rates.
62.      In the Statement of Development Policies - 1984, the Government has
reaffirmed its intention to move rapidly and systematically in the direction
of eliminating all import licensing and rationalizing the tariff structure.
This policy is an essential component of the medium term structural adjustment
process because it will help to remcve the serious bias in favor of the
domestic market and against exports. At the same time, the policy is geared
to increasing the operational efficiency of both private and public sector
firms by eliminating the buffers which protect them from market forces. The
Government intends to reduce quantitative restrictions on imports to a
negligible level by the end of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1989). The 1985
Import Regime would therefore reflect additional movements in this direction
in line with this objective.
63.      With respect to the tariff structure, the Government is committed to
a policy of incremental reductions in effective protection as well as to a
reduction of its dispersion across sectors. To achieve this aim the
Government has set for itself a target of achieving an average nominal tariff
on items subject to tariffs of 7 percent by the end of the Fifth Plan period
and expects to make satisfactory progress in this direction in the 1985 Import
Regime, using inter alia the re!sults of the Protection Study expected to be
completed in 1984. It also intends to set up an appropriate institutional
mechanism to dispose of industry appeals and to establish criteria for
granting temporary production incentives to infant industries.
64.      Satisfactory progress in the elimination of quantitative restrictions
and the rationalization of the tariff structure (as specified in the above
paragraphs) would constitute a condition of tranche release (Loan Agreement,
Schedule 5).
Export Incentives
65.      The promotion of export growth continues to play a central role in
Turkey's development strategy. The most significant export incentive has been
the maintenance of a realistic exchange rate, adjusted daily since May 1981



- 28 -
against a trade-weighted basket of currencies. Low cost export credits,
indirect tax rebates, and privileged access to foreign exchange and imports
have further increased the attractiveness of exports. 1/
66.      These incentives contributed to an unprecedented export growth in
1981 to $4.7 billion, or 63 percent higher in dollar terms than the 1980
level. The increases were concentrated in manufactured goods, which
registered a rise of nearly 120 percent. Exports in 1982 reached
$5.75 billion, about 22 percent above 1981, despite a significant decline in
export prices, particularly agricultural products. In 1983 exports grew by an
estimated 14 percent in volume, but their value at $5.73 billion was slightly
lower than in 1982 because of a sharp downward movement in export prices.
Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the rapid expansion of exports
occurred in an inhospitable world environment. This was possible in part
because Turkey successfully exploited the market possibilities in the Middle
East and North Africa while maintaining a rapid rate of growth of exports to
the OECD countries. The expansion of merchandise exports is also partly
attributable to previous low capacity utilization, depressed domestic demand
and the high cost of non-preferential credits (which made export credits more
attractive) associated with stabilization.
67.      The new Government's policy places emphasis on the reduction of
import protection and the maintena[nce of the competitiveness of the exchange
rate, accompanied by a gradual reduction in incentives in the form of tax
rebates and credits. In January 1984, the Government announced its intention
of scaling down export tax rebates in a phased manner. The interest rate on
export credits has also been increased from an average of 28.5 percent to
35 percent in December 1983, and further increased to 40 percent in
March 1984. With the objective of phasing out the direct availability of
Central Bank credit for export purposes, the reserve requirements on
commercial bank funds from deposits used for export credits have been reduced
from 25 percent to 20 percent.
68.      Since the Government intends to use ithe exchange rate as the main
policy instrument to stimulate exports, the mechanics of exchange rate
determination were modified in January 1984 to add more flexibility to the
system. Under the new system, the official exchange rate is still determined
daily by the Central Bank on the basis of foreign currency markets and
domestic relative to foreign prices; actual transactions, however, take place
at a rate which is set by commercial banks ancd is allowed to fluctuate within
a band of 6 percent (8 percent for banknotes) around the official rate. In
practice, the above modification brought about: an effective one-step
depreciation of the Turkish lira of about 6 percent early in 1984. In
parallel, commercial banks have been given greater freedom to perform foreign
exchange operations on their own account. They are no longer required to sell
to the Central Bank a prescribed percentage of foreign exchange purchased; in
addition, most foreign exchange operations have been transferred to commercial
banks. The surrender requirement on export earniings has been lowered to
80 percent and that on invisible receipts has been eliminated. Retained
foreign exchange earnings may be deposited in foreign exchange accounts
1/ A fuller description of these incentives and their importance is given in
the Industrialization and Trade Strategy Report (No. 3641-TU), Chapter 2.



- 29 -
or transferred to other parties without restriction. The Government views
these changes as a major first step towards the complete elimination of
exchange controls over the medium term.
69.      During 1984, the Government intends to undertake a detailed review of
the entire package of export incentives. This requires an assessment of the
relative importance of each incentive in order to design a framework for a
sustained export drive compatible with the expected rise in domestic demand
and a fall in interest rates for non-exporters in the medium term. The review
of export incentives will in particular examine the feasibility of;
(i)   implementing a system of medium and long-term credits to support
the exports of capital goods and engineering services;
(ii)   introducing a system of export credit insurance; and
(iii)   establishing a new Export Development and Promotion Center with
strong private sector participation. 1/
External Debt
70.      Progress has been slow in this area since the inception of work uncder
SAL I. However, the Government recognizes that the major obstacle in
formulating a proper debt management: policy is the inability to compile and
evaluate the appropriate data rapidly and accurately. In order to facilitate
data handling, the Bank supported a program under SAL I for the Ministry of
Finance to undertake the computerization of Turkey's debt recording system.
Although a system was designed with the help of a local consultant, subsequent
evaluation showed that it was inadequate to handle the complexity of Turkey's
debt structure. Following a request from the Ministry of Finance for
technical assistance in this area, a joint project supported by the Bank and
the Fund was launched under SAIL IV. At present Phase I of this project (the
design phase) which consists of an assessment of the system of information
flows and the development of input and output formats, is on schedule with
completion expected by August 1984. Progress has been slow in this area in
the past, but with the new agreements included in the SAL IV program now on
track, the Government is turning its attention to the next phase of the
project.
71.      A detailed plan of aclion for Phase II has been drawn up by the
Government. The installation and testing of the computerized debt system
(Phase II) will begin in Augusit 1984 with Bank and Fund support. At that time
the Bank will finance the services of a systems analyst through its recent
technical assistance loan to SEEs, which contains an external debt component
with the External Debt Division of the Undersecretariat of Treasury and
Foreign Trade as the beneficiary. The Bank will also make available at that
time its recently developed prototype external debt computer system for
modifications on site according to Turkish requirements. The installation of
the system is scheduled to begin thereafter with completion expected by August
1985. The Government has agreed to accord the highest priority to the
successful completion of this project including:
1/ These measures were recommended in the Bank's reports on Industrialization
and Trade Strategy (Report No. 3641-TU) and on the Financial Sector
(Report No. 4459-TU).



- 30 -
(i)   providing the necessary institutional and legal arrangements for
implementing and maintaining a central computerized data base;
(ii)   ensuring adequate staffing of theb project team as well as
continuity in the management of the project; and
(iii)   allocating the necessary financial resources.
Satisfactory progress in the installation of the computerized debt management
system would be a condition of tranche release (Loan Agreement, Schedule 5).
Financial Sector
72.      The Government recognizes that a more efficient financial sector is
necessary to increase domestic resources as well as help the revival of
private investment. The Government's objectives are to restore and maintain
confidence in the financial system and to expand its range, reduce the cost of
credit, improve the efficiency of credit allocation, allow more competition in
the financial sector, strengthen the institutions which supervise the
financial system and revitalize the capital market.
73.      Important measures were taken in 1983 and in the first quarter of
1984 to improve the efficiency of the financial sector in Turkey. The
interest rate policy was changed, the charges on financial transactions
imposed by the fiscal system were sharply reduced as also were some of the
distortions in credit allocation resulting from the excessive subsidization of
some types of selective credits, a new banking law was enacted, bank
competition was stimulated by the authorizations granted for the entry of new
foreign banks, and substantial progress was achieved in laying the basis for
the development of the capital market.
74.      The Government reduced the interest rates on time deposits in January
and in July 1983, 1/ on the basis of its own projections of falling inflation
and with the purpose of reducing the cost of bank loans to borrowers. At the
same time, the net interest rate on sight savings deposits was increased to
16 percent. However, instead of declining as projected, inflation accelerated
considerably during the second half of 1983, with the result that the real
interest rate on deposits, measured in relation to prevailing inflationary
trends, had become negative to the extent of about 5 percent by the end of
1983. Consequently, there was a significant reduction in the demand for time
deposits, which although partially explained by shifts of funds into currency,
and sight deposits, caused a decline in the real value of broad money and thus
contributed to a further fuelling of inflation.,
75.      One of the first decisions of the new Government was to correct this
situation by re-establishing positive real interest rates for time deposits.
Interest rates on six-month and one-year time deposits were raised in
December 1983 from 35 percent and 40 percent to 47 percent and 45 percent
respectively.  The interest rate on sight savings deposits was reduced to
5 percent and an interest rate of 49 percent was introduced for deposits with
three months' withdrawal notice. More recently, an interest rate of
1/ For example, in January the interest rate cn 12-month time deposits was
lowered from 50 percent to 45 percent. In July it was further reduced to
40 percent.



- 31 -
43 percent was introduced for deposits with a withdrawal notice of one month.
Under the new policy, the interest rate for deposits will be revised quarterly
in line with changes in the inflationary expectations and with the situation
in the credit markets. Although it is still too early to evaluate the results
of the new policy, there are signs that it is already producing the desired
results. The downward trend in the demand for broad money (M2) has been
reversed, and the stock of M2 in real terms seems to be increasing.
76.      The burden imposed by the financial transactions tax and the
withholding tax on the costs of financial intermediation was also
substantially reduced. The rate of the financial transactions tax levied cn
interest earnings and other revenues of the banks (with the exception of
interest received from some selective credits) was lowered from 15 percent to
3 percent at the beginning of 1984. The rate of the withholding tax
applicable to interest payments was reduced from 25 percent to 20 percent in
January 1983 and further to 10 percent in February 1984.
77.      All the interest rates on preferential credits have been adjusted
upwards at the end of 1983, in accordance with the principle of reducing the
differences between them and the rates for non-preferential credits. The
difference between the interest rate (currently 40 percent) on short-term
export credits, which are by far the most important of selective credits, and
the interest rate on non-preferential credits of the same maturity, is at
present only on the order of 8 percentage points, as opposed to almost
20 percentage points at the beginning of 1983. The interest rates on
agricultural and housing credits and on credits to artisans have been
increased by 6 percentage points in December 1983. 1/ Although these interest
rates still remain significantly below the rates applicable to
non-preferential credits, they exceed slightly the rate of increase in prices
projected by the Turkish authorities from the beginning to the end of 1984.
78.      A new Banking Law was enacted in June 1983 with the objective of
strengthening the banking system. The new law covers many of the
recommendations made in the Bank's report on the Financial Sector 2/,
including measures to reduce the undercapitalization of banks, place limits on
the real assets and investments of banks, link the establishment of branches
to the level of banks' equity, reduce the interlocking between banks and
corporations, introduce a deposit insurance scheme, and strengthen the role of
the Central Bank in the supervision of the banking sector.
79.      In recent months there has been substantial progress in the
development of the Turkish capital market. The amount of new issues of shares
and bonds more than doubled in 1983 as compared with the preceding year and it
is expected that further substantial growth will be achieved in 1984. The
Treasury has started to offer bonds and bills to the public at competitive
interest rates and five issues of such bonds and bills have already been mtade
1/ In December 1983 the interest rate on short-term agricultural credits was
raised from 20 percent to 26 percent, and on medium-term agricultural
credits from 22 percent to 28 percent.
2/ 4459-TU, dated September 21, 1983.

in the current year. The withholding tax on bearer securities has been
reduced from 30 to 10 percent. New regulations relating to capital market
intermediaries have been published and certificates authorizing the operations
of several intermediaries have already been granted by the Capital Market
Board. Although more decisive progress is stiLl required in the areas of
accounting, auditing and disclosure of informal'ion of companies which make
public issues of securities, the authorities have published a system of
standardized accounting which is being adopted by many firms on a voluntary
basis. The technical capabilities of the Capital Market Board are in the
process of being developed and preparatory work: for the opening of the Stock
Exchange is already at an advanced stage.
80.      The SAL V program supports the Governnment's policies to reduce high
real interest rates through a reduction in the operating costs of the banking
system and by providing competition through the development of an efficient
capital market. The authorization given recently to allow two more foreign
banks to operate in Turkey, which raises to 11 the number of foreign banks
permitted to open branches in the country, is expected to contribute to
increased competition and put pressure on the existing banks to reduce their
operating costs. Similarly, the development of the capital market, in which
the intermediation margins are typically much lower than those of the banking
system, is expected to act as a stimulus to increased bank efficiency. In
addition, the Government intends to study the introduction of fiscal measures
(including the imposition of tax pernalties) designed to induce banks to reduce
their operating costs. In order to further develop the capital market, the
Government intends as part of the SAL V program to intensify the issue of
treasury bonds to be subscribed by the public at competitive interest rates,
to diversify the channels for the marketing of such bonds, to establish a
program for the gradual adoption of a system of standardized accounts by
companies making public issues of securities, to enact a law regulating the
requirements and activities of external auditors and to open a Stock Exchange
in Istanbul after publication of the regulations required for that purpose.
81.      Among the further improvements in the banking system which need to be
implemented may be mentioned the development of an active inter-bank market
and the strengthening of the mechanisms for bank supervision. In order to
reduce the remaining tax obstacles to the further development of the
inter-bank market, the Government intends to see!k legislative authorization
for the elimination by the end of 1984 of the financial transactions tax of
3 percent which still remains on inter-bank transactions. For strengthening
the mechanisms of bank supervision, one of the most important preliminary
steps will be the introduction of a system of standardized accounts for
financial institutions. The Government is already working on the preparation
of such a system and intends to prepare a review of progress by October 1984,
with the specification of the remaining steps to be taken in order to
introduce the system in the first half of 1985.
82.      In order to monitor progress in achieving the various objectives in
the financial sector, satisfactory progress towards the following goals would
be a condition of tranche release (Loan Agreement, Schedule 5):
(i)   elimination of the financial transaction tax on inter-bank
transactions;



- 33 -
(ii)   preparation by October 1984 of a review of a standardized
accounting system for banks for implementation in the first half
of 1985;
(iii)   issue of Treasury bonds to be subscribed by the public at
competitive interest rates and diversification of the channels
for the marketing of such bonds;
(iv)   preparation of an action program for introducing a standardizied
accounting system for companies making public issues of bonds or
shares;
(v)   enactment of a law regulating the requirements and activities of
external auditors;
(vi)   opening of the Stock Exchange and publication of the regulations
required for it; and
(vii)   study of fiscal measures to induce banks to reduce operating
costs.
Agriculture
83.      The attainment of thie planned overall GDP and export growth in the
medium term depends crucially on the reattainment of the historical growth
rate of agricultural value added of about 3 percent per annum under conditions
of markedly reduced subsidization and greater exposure to market forces. This
target, when compared with performance during 1980-83 (when agricultural value
added increased by about 2 percent per annum, on average), appears
formidable. Since the possibilities for growth through expansion of the
cultivable area or of livestock numbers under a system of extensive grazing
were largely exhausted by the mid--1970s, growth must now come primarily from
increased productivity and changing the crop mix to better reflect Turkey's
comparative advantage. A number of significant reforms have been introduced
since 1980 in the areas of input-output pricing and other producer incentives,
encouragement for processors and exporters, and the deregulation of foreign
trade. While the rate of growth in total public investment has been cut back,
agriculture's share has increased with more emphasis on the completion of key
irrigation projects. A measure of discipline has been introduced in the
financing of parastatals, but their operational capabilities still remain
weak. What is needed now is to consolidate these actions within a longer-term
framework. The preparation of the Fifth Plan offers a good opportunity for
the Government to develop such a framework.
84.      The key sectoral issues are identified in the recent Bank report on
the agriculture sector. 1/ The major recommendations relate to;
(i)   promotion of the greater use of market forces through the reform
of trade policies as well as through further reductions in
1/ "Turkey: Agricultural Development-Alternatives for Growth with Exports"
(Report No. 4204-TU).



- 34 -
subsidies and price supports, inl:erest rate reforms, and
increased involvement of the private sector in the marketing of
agricultural inputs and products;;
(ii)   support to institutional reform, particularly the development of
improved research and extension services, the establishment of a
sectoral planning capability, thE: reform of Government
enterprises involved in agricultural marketing and input supply,
and improvements in the impLementation capacity of irrigation
agencies;
(iii)   continued rationalization of? the public sector investment
program, particularly in irrigation, with greater focus on quick
gestating investment; and
(iv)   expanded credit supply, particularly for medium and small-scale
farmers, together with increased efficiency of credit
institutions.
85.      The Government intends to work with the Bank in formulating an action
program for the agriculture sector by the end of 1984 to address the above
issues. This will provide the basis for a proposed agricultural sector policy
loan.
Energy
86.      For well over a decade modernization and industrialization in Turkey
have been directly linked to a rapidly increasi.ng and widespread use of scarce
and costly imported petroleum. Oil imports, which were only $200 million in
1970, jumped to about $3.5 billion in each of t:he years from 1980 to 1983.
Although the value of oil imports as a percentage of export earnings has
fallen from a peak of 124 percent in 1980 to about 61 percent in 1983, the
energy situation remains a major preoccupation of the Government.  Recognizing
the intricate relationship between economic growth and energy supplies, the
Government has assigned the highest priority tc, the energy sector and to
projects that will reduce the energy deficit. For example, during the period
1980-83 energy investments received about 35 percent of total public
investment, compared to around 20 percent during the 1970s. Allocations are
likely to be maintained at least at this level during the rest of the 1980s.
87.      At this level of investment: it appears that currently the resources
available exceed effective implementation capacity. The key issues,
therefore, are better management of project implementation and operation,
increased efficiency and reduced reliance on imported energy. The Government
is aware of the importance of strengthening the institutions concerned but
realizes that this will take time. Moreover, even under optimistic
assumptions, lignite and hydropower production is likely to grow too slowly to
meet the full requirements of a dynamically growing economy.
88.      Although Turkey is relatively well endowed with hydropower and
lignite, the potential for developing other energy resources such as
hydrocarbons is not particularly promising, although some gas discoveries have
been made recently. Geothermal energy shows an important potential but the



- 35 -
size of the reserves and the problems of their development are unknown. There
are large bituminous shale reserves available but these appear to be
uneconomic for the foreseeable future. Renewable energy resources in the form
of fuelwood and agricultural waste are increasingly scarce in many parts of
the country, and will become an acute problem in some areas. The primary
focus in the Government's program has thus been on hydropower and lignite,
although the Government has also been considering options based on nuclear
power as well as coal and gas imports.
89.      It is clear that a significant energy deficit is likely to remain a
feature of the Turkish economy until well into the 1990s. As part of its
ongoing sector work program, t:he Bank has prepared an energy strategy paper
focussing on actions to be undertaken in the short and medium term. The paper
recommends the formulation of a cralsh program for energy development, to
include the following principal elements:
(i)   completion of ongoing, high priority power and lignite projects;
(ii)   improvement in the efficiency of the existing thermal power
plants, distribution system, and mines;
(iii)   a review of the feasibility of constructing new generating
plants, including combined cycle units;
(iv)   expansion of existing lignite mines; and
(v)   increasing the efficiency of energy use, including the
strengthening of the energy conservation program.
90.      The energy strategy paper has already been forwarded to the
Government, which has welcomed the opportunity to discuss the paper's
recommendations with the Bank and to prepare an energy action plan with the
assistance of the Bank by the end of 1984. Satisfactory progress in the
preparation of the action plan would be a condition of tranche release (Loan
Agreement, Schedule 5).
PART IV - OVERVIEW, PROSPECTS AND ISSUES
Overview
91.      Evaluation of the Structural Adjustment Progra . The structural
adjustment program in Turkey represents a systematic effort to change the
basic direction of the country's economic development. The present loan
completes the series of five loans, which the Bank had indicated would be the
maximum to a country. The series has been successful in helping to support a
major effort at restructuring. The changes that are being attempted will take
several years to be completed. Deeply-entrenched attitudes will also change
only slowly. Consequently, although an assessment can be made of the progress
achieved so far, it is too early to attempt a definitive evaluation of the
reform program in Turkey. Its success will be measured by how effectively it
is pursued and instituted. The Bank plans, of course, to support further
progress through its sector and project operations.
92.      This report has summarized some of the important changes that have
occurred in the economy since 1980.  To recapitulate, the specific
accomplishments during this period, have included the following:



- 36 -
-    the rate of inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index,
has dropped from an annual rate of about 107 percent in 1980 to
31 percent in 1983;
-    merchandise exports have risen from $2.9 billion in 1980 to
$5.7 billion in 1983, with export growth being led by the
manufacturing sector and involving a significant diversification
of markets. The current account deficit has fallen from
$3.2 billion (5.6 percent of GNP) in 1980 to about $2.0 billion
(3.4 percent of GNP) in 1983;
-    there has been a marked retrenchment of the public sector.
Government Consolidated Budget expenditures, which stood at
24.0 percent of GNP in 1980, felL to 19.4 percent in 1983. The
budget deficit to GNP ratio, which stood at 4.6 percent in 1980,
decreased steadily to 1.4 percen1: in 1981, 1.2 percent in 1982,
and 0.5 percent in 1983, while SEE transfers as a percentage of
GNP showed a decline from 4.8 percent in 1980 to 2.5 percent in
1983. The financial performance of SEEs also registered
substantial improvement, as a situation of chronic deficits
changed to one of growing profits;
-    successful efforts have been made to constrain the level of
public investment in Line with available resources, to limit the
number of projects to a manageable level, and to ensure that
priority projects received larger allocations in order to speed
up their completion. Allocations for the energy, agriculture and
transport sectors have! been increased and the share of
manufacturing reduced., Public sector investment in real terms
increased by 2.2 percent in 1982 and by 1.7 percent in 1983,
while private investme!nt rose by 5.4 percent and 4.8 percent
during those two years. As a result, there has been a
significant improvement in the share of private fixed investment
in total investment;
-    substantial progress has been made in import liberalization,
through the abolition of quotas, c'he freeing of a large number of
items from licensing, rationalization of tariffs and a
simplification of administrative procedures;
-    in the energy and agriculture sectors, actions have been taken to
increase institutional efficiency, adjust prices closer to
economic levels and reduce input subsidies in a phased manner; and
-    measures have been initiated to simplify the regulations
surrounding banking operations and improve the performance of
money and capital markets.
93.      Even this brief list of accomplishments shows how far the Turkish
economy has moved in the last four years and demonstrates clearly the
existence of a strong and sustained government commitment without which no
structural adjustment program can succeed. Admittedly, there was a weakening
of the adjustment process in some respects during 1983, but some of the
contributory factors were exogenous to Turkey. It is also not unusual for
governments to postpone important decisions whe;n elections are imminent. The
point to note is that such events can and do happen in all countries, and that
some ups and downs must be allowed for in evaluiating overall progress.



- 37 -
94.      The pace of implementation of reforms is clearly a matter of
judgement for each country. It; is encouraging that the new Government has
acted swiftly to deal with the adverse developments of 1983 and to push the
structural adjustment program firmly forward. The principal challenge for the
Government now is to get the restructuring fully back on track and to carry
out sectoral reforms to complement those already implemented at the macro
level. Some difficult problems remain to be tackled, including, in
particular, depressed private investment and high unemployment, both
concomitants of a prolonged period of stabilization which are likely to be
mitigated only as inflation is brought fully under control and growth recovers.
95.      Role of the Bank.  While the initiative for structural adjustment has
rightly come from the Government, there is little doubt that the association
of the Bank has exerted a positive influence on the reform process. The
policy dialogue between the Government and the Bank has helped ensure that the
attention of the economic decision makers remains focussed on the fundamental
structural problems facing the economy. Moreover, as the chart at Annex V
listing the components of the individual SALs demonstrates, the pattern of a
series of loans has allowed for an orderly and evolutionary development of
policy, with the opportunity of periodically taking stock of the progress
achieved and charting the next steps. The Bank's SALs, by providing the basis
for a systematic and coordinated approach to the resolution of the principal
macroeconomic and sectoral problems of the economy, have complemented the
focus of traditional project lending. The success of the SAL process also
underlines the potential benefits of developing sector policy lending vehicles
for continuing the policy dialogue at the sectoral level.
96.      The successive SALs form only one part, although an important one, of
the support that the Bank has provided to the structural adjustment program.
Other components include project loans, economic and sector work leading to
policy recommendations, and technical assistance. A substantial part of the
lending and economic programs is geared to the realization of the objectives
of structural adjustment, most notably in the fields of industrial policy,
energy and agriculture. The Bank's economic and sector studies have in
particular helped to strengthen the Government's policy formulation. The
Bank's supporting activities also include special economic studies funded by
the Bank, staff advisory assistance, for example on the External Debt
Management System and the use of planning models, and a number of technical
assistance packages within the project loan agreements. The Bank will
continue with this comprehensive approach to structural adjustment in the
coming years, but will seek to broaden and deepen the process by concentrating
increasingly on sectoral and sub-sectoral issues.
97.      The Project Completion Report dated December 17, 1981 on SAL I and
the SAL I Supplement and the related Project Performance Audit Report
(Report No. 4015) of June 30, 1982 supported the Turkish outward oriented
strategy based on a flexible exchange rate policy, combined with better
control over aggregate demand through monetary, fiscal, and incomes policies.
Both reports highlighted the reduction of inflation and progress towards
establishing a price structure conducive to a better supply response in
1980-81. The Audit Report noted the slow progress in the areas of
rationalization of public investment, SEE reforms and resource mobilization.
The subsequent SALs placed special emphasis on these issues. For example,
rationalization of public investment featured prominently in SALs III and IV



- 38 -
and helped the Government to constrain the size of public investment in line
with the available resources, inc:rease allocations to high priority projects
to speed up their completion and harmonize sectoral allocations with the macro
objectives. One of the main conclitions attached to SAL III was the passage of
the SEE reform legislation, which was Enacted in May 1983.  A number of
measures related to domestic resource mobilization were covered in the program
under SALs II-IV. These includecl improvements in tax administration,
development of an efficient Capital Market and financial sector reforms. An
audit of SALs II and III by the Ciperations Evaluation Department is under way.
98.      Bank/IMF Cooperation.  The Bank's support for the structural
adjustment program in Turkey has from its inception involved a close working
relationship with the IMF. In June 1980, the IMF entered into a three-year
Standby Arrangement with the Government of Turkey for a total of
SDR 1250 million (about $1.6 billion). The Bank's SAL lencing during the same
period amounted to about $1.2 billion. The principal conditions of the
Standby were the maintenance of external competitiveness through a flexible
exchange rate policy, ceilings on Central Bank credit to control aggregate
demand, and limitations on budget transfers t:o SEEs. Other conditions related
to the timely fulfillment of reserve requirenients of banks, limits on the
contracting of new nonconcessional public or publicly-guaranteed external
debt, and a performance criterion on trade and payment restrictions.
Following completion of the three-year arrangement, a new one-year Standby in
an amount of SDR225 million was approved in Junie 1983. Upon the election of
the new Government, Turkey requested cancellation of the existing Standby and
its replacement with a new one-year arrangement in an amount equivalent to
SDR 225 million. This proposal was approved in early April 1984 by the Fund's
Executive Board and immediately went into effect. Conditions of the new
Standby are broadly similar to the previous ones and reflect the Government's
determination to bring the inflation trend back in line with expectations.
99.      The Bank and the Fund are in agreement with the basic position that
stabilization of the economy is an essential prerequisite for a return to a
sustainable growth path. The Bank, takes the view that the period of austerity
necessary to bring inflation under control, redress the public finances, and
improve the balance of payments should be used to lay the groundwork for a
major restructuring of the Turkish economy. Thus, the Fund's attention to the
country's monetary and fiscal balance, the maintenance of external
competitiveness, and SEE financial performance has complemented the Bank's
structural adjustment efforts in the areas of SEE reform, import
liberalization, export promotion, rationalization of public investment, and
the development of a medium-term framework.
Creditworthiness
100.     At the end of 1978, Turkey had $7.5 billion in short-term debt and
$6.8 billion in medium- and long-term debt. Service payment obligations
(mostly on short-term debt) were $5.1 billion (including arrears), or nearly
three times the value of merchandise exports in 1977. Between 1978 and 1980,
Turkey rescheduled some $9.2 billion of outstanding obligations through a
series of rescheduling arrangements concluded with official and commercial
creditors. Approximately $6.0 billion of short-term debt, including
$2.6 billion in convertible Turkish lira deposits and bankers credits and
$1.2 billion of non-guaranteed suppliers credits, were consolidated into
medium-term loans or partially converted into Turkish lira obligations.



-- 39 -
101.     In the period following the resolution of the debt crisis, inflows
were mostly from official sources -- the major creditors being the OECD
countries, the World Bank and the IMF. Of the total debt outstanding of about
$20 billion at end-1982, 82 percent constituted medium- and long-term debt.
Short-term debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding fell from 51 percent
in 1978 to about 10.5 percent in 1982. Based on the growth scenario outlined
earlier, the debt outstanding and disbursed as a percentage of GDP is
projected to fall from about 40.0 percent in 1983 to about 32.0 percent in
1989.
102.     Debt service obligations are likely to be high over the coming
years. The debt service ratio increased from 15.3 percent in 1981 to
28 percent in 1983 as a result of a Large repayment of previously rescheduled
debt under the earlier OECD agreements. On the assumption that the average
annual gross capital inflows during the period 1985-89 will be on tne order of
$4.8 billion, the projections beyond 1984 show a debt service ratio of
25.3 percent in 1985 and 23.4 percent in 1989.  The debt burden should remain
manageable provided current policies are successfully implemented, the export
drive is sustained and Turkey continues to receive further support from
international commercial and official sources. There are some recent
encouraging signs of Turkey's ability to enter the commercial market for
medium-term loans. In July 1983 the Central Bank of Turkey received a
$200 million five-year syndicated loan for balance of payments needs. More
recently, a similar agreement was signed in March 1984 with a consortium of
36 foreign banks for a $300 million six-year syndicated loan. In addition, a
consortium of Swiss and German banks signed a SwF 980 million credit in March
1984 for the financing of hydraulic and electrical equipment for the Ataturk
Dam.
Social Costs of Restructuring
103.     The structural adjustment program in Turkey, as in other countries,
has entailed some transitional costs, primarily in terms of depressed domestic
demand, increased unemployment and lower real wages, some distortion in income
distribution and cuts in social expenditures. However, the costs of
adjustment should be seen in the perspective of Turkey's economic situation
when the program was initiated. The country then had been on a totally
unsustainable growth path that would have had much more serious consequences
in the course of time for all income groups. The current economic situation
in Turkey dictates giving the highest priority to export promotion and the
control of inflation, in order to lay the basis for sustained growth. In such
a situation it is difficult to meaningfully address social issues. These
issues can only be solved over the longer haul as part of the restructuring
process. As the Government has stressed in its Statement of Development
Policies - 1984, social issues can be resolved more easily and rapidly in an
economy which develops under stable conditions. There are political risks in
all instances of structural adjustment since it is usually associated with an
initial slowdown or even decline in growth rates. In the case of Turkey, the
slowdown has been modest compared to other countries.
104.     The available data on unemployment, while not fully reliable,
indicate a deterioration in the employment situation, with unemployment
increasing from about 15 percent in 1980 to about 19 percent at present. Over
the medium-term, the unemployment problem will only be reduced if there is
substantial economic growth resulting from increased private investment and



- 40 -
exports. Success in structural adjustment hinges upon the maintenance of the
policy of real positive interest rates, encouragement of exports which are
mostly from labor-intensive activities, and a reduction in the share of public
investments, all of which should reduce the bias in favor of high
capital-intensive investments and promote employment.
105.     There is little doubt that there has been a significant erosion in
real wages since 1977 although it is difficult to quantify since there are
widely varying data series. One series, compiled by the Social Insurance
Institute on the basis of the average daily wages reported to it and presented
in Table 12 below, suggests that real wages declined by over 35 percent in the
period 1980-82, in contrast to the period 1973-77 when real wages increased by
about 29 percent.

106.     The Government expects to mitigate the erosion in real income by
reducing and controlling inflation. But it will clearly take time before any
major improvement is evident.  In the slhort-run, the Government's stated
policy is to maintain as a minimum the real income of civil servants, workers
and pensioners. This is expected to be brought about by general salary
increases and through tax reductions as well as the proposed scheme for tax
rebates for certain categories of personal expenditures.
107.     The Government's program also includes some additional measures to
alleviate social hardships. The most noteworthy is the passage of the Public
Housing Fund Law in February 1984 to address the acute housing shortage in
Turkey. It is a major departure irom previous housing legislation in that the
revenues for the Fund are to be derived from non-budgetary sources, mainly
earmarked taxes on monopoly and petroleum products as well as import levies on
luxury items. This Fund will be administered by the Housing Council in the
Prime Minister's office.
Risks
108.     In 1984, Turkey is at a stage of transition between stabilization and
the beginning of sustainable growth. The Government has put in place many of
the policies designed to bring about a fundamental change in the economy



- 41 -
towards outward orientation and reliance upon market mechanisms. This
strategy hinges on appropriate actions in three main policy areas; trade,
investment and resource mobilization. However, the actions in these areas
have to be balanced against two other considerations, namely their likely
impact on inflation and employment.
109.     During the next phase, the Government's structural adjustment program
faces the following main risks:
(i)   the expected improvement in the current account of the balance of
payments may not materialize;
(ii)   Turkey may not get adequate support from the international
financial community;
(iii)   private investment may remain sluggish; and
(iv)   the cost of stabilization in the form of increased unemployment
and non-increasing real wages may lead to pressure on the
Government to weaken stabilization policies earlier than expecteld.
These risks are discussed at greater length below.
110.     Balance of Payments.  The medium-term prospects outlined in this
report are derived on the assumption of export sustainability and moderate
growth in consumer goods imports following the liberalization efforts.
Factors which threaten the sustainability of future export growth include a
slow recovery of OECD economies, a quick revival of domestic demand, the
instability of the new export markets in light of the recent decline in oil
prices and continuing political difficulties, the sluggishness of private
investment in manufacturing and the possible weakening of export incentives,
including some relaxation in the exchange rate policy. An additional risk
which threatens the balance of payments is the possibility of higher than
desirable growth in consumer and luxury goods imports as a result of the
recent import liberalization measures which allow the import of luxury goods,
although subject to fairly substantial levies. These risks are not
inconsequential since the recovery of the Turkish economy and its ability to
service a sizeable level of debt depends heavily on the successful expansion
of exports. Failure of the export drive, given the dependence on imports,
could mean that Turkey would have to resort to a strategy of reduced growth as
a mechanism of adjustment, if it is to avoid a repetition of the problems of
the late 1970s.
ill.     Support From the International Financial Community.  Turkey's
prospects for future commercial borrowing appear good in light of the recent
successes in securing medium-term syndicated loans. However, it is unlikely
that the level and composition of concessional medium and long-term financing
realized in 1980 will be repeated. Hence Turkey will need a significant
amount of foreign commercial bank credit, in addition to the diversification
of its bilateral aid arrangements especially with the Middle Eastern
countries. There are, however, uncertainties involved since the payment
difficulties affecting developing countries in general may adversely affect
the syndicated loan market.



- 42 -
112.     Recovery of Private Investment.  Another major risk concerns the
response of private investment to the adjustment process. An inevitable
consequence of stabilization policies is the low level of private investment
in manufacturing and the threat to the solvenicy of some of the commercial
banks and private firms. Depressed domiestic demand, the inadequacy of the
Turkish financial sector, high real interest rates for non-preferential
borrowing, and the lack of equity funds are the major medium-term issues
facing the recovery. For the immediate future, the existence of underutilized
capacity in many industries still offers the best prospect for expansion of
production without further investment. But in the medium-term, the current
level of private investment will have to be raised. The current steps to
restructure the financial sector assume grealt importance in this respect. In
addition, the stabilization process should lay the groundwork for a
progressive increase in private investment by Lowering and stabilizing
inflation. The revival of private investment is, in the final analysis,
dependent on the confidence of local entrepreneurs in the Government's
determination to pursue the objectives of structural adjustment.
113.     Trade-Off Between Growth and Stabilization.  Turkey's development
strategy hinges on export growth and fiscal and monetary discipline as the
basis for sustained growth.  Under these concitions, the growth rate is
expected to be modest in 1985 and 1986, with prospects only of marginal
improvements in employment creation and real wages. A major risk facing the
Government is the temptation to resort to a high growth strategy to alleviate
these problems by abandoning stabilization policies earlier than desirable and
without laying an adequate foundat-ion for sustainable growth.
114.     On balance, while these risks are serious, they do not appear
insurmountable. Although sustained efforts will be necessary to attain the
export targets, they are, nevertheless, feasible provided that the Government
continues with its policies regarding the exchange rate, export incentives and
import liberalization. Similarly, while Turkey's liquidity position is likely
to remain tight in 1984-86, on balance the external resources being made
available to the economy provide suffici.ent room for Turkey to implement its
medium-term adjustment program effectively. A strong revival of private
investment in the medium-term is feasible provided inflation is brought under
control, public investment does not encroach on private resources and the
financial sector performs its role of efficiently mobilizing and allocating
resources. While there could be pressures to abandon stabilization policies
to promote growth for the alleviation of social hardship, the Government's
clear political mandate reduces this risk considerably.
PART V - THE PROPOSED LOAN
115.     Tne proposed loan is the fifth in a series of loans supporting the
Government's structural adjustment program initiated in January of 1980. The
main developments of the program have been described in this report. A letter
from the Deputy Prime Minister dated May 1, 1984 sets out the major
refinements in the program and the new policy actions envisaged for 1984 and
early 1985. The letter and its updating Statement of Development Policies --
1984 are attached as Annex IV-A. Preliminary discussions on the possible
content of the SAL V package were held with the Government in January 1984,
and the proposed loan was appraised in March ]984. Negotiations were held in
Washington on May 16, 1984. The Government delegation was headed by Mr. Tunc
Bilget, Chief Counselor for Financial and Economic Affairs, Embassy of the
Republic of Turkey.



- 43 -
116.     Tne proposed loan of $376 million (including the capitalized
front-end fee) would finance about 4 percent of Turkey's total merchandise
imports and about 13 percent of the gross capital inflows over the
disbursement period (mid-1984 to mid-1985). The loan is designed to continue
Bank support for the structural adjustment program through 1984 and early
1985, and has been determined partly in light of the overall size of the
Bank's lending program for Turkey.
117.     The proposed loan would finance all goods to be imported into Turkey
except for goods financed by other sources and a specific list of excluded
items such as military or para-military items and luxury goods such as
tobacco, precious stones and jewelry, gold, and nuclear reactors and parts.
Counterpart funds would be deposited in a special account with the Central
Bank; as under previous SALs, the Government would continue to use these to
help finance expenditures included in its development programs. While the
Bank has not sought to influence the Government in its allocation of funds,
the Government has indicated that it would expect to continue to allocate the
funds to high priority development projects.
Procurement, Disbursement and Administration
118.     The satisfactory administrative arrangements made for SALs I-IV would
be continued, with the Undersecretariat for Treasury and Foreign Trade and the
Central Bank bearing the main responsibility for administering the proposed
loan. Procurement and disbursement performance under the SALs has been
entirely satisfactory. To simplify cdisbursement, only invoices with a minimum
value of $50,000 equivalent would be eligible for disbursement (Loan
Agreement, Section 2.10(b)). The loan would be disbursed against only foreign
expenditures, with retroactive f:inancing permitted up to $37.6 million of
expenditures made after June 1, 1984 (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1,
para. 2(c)). The retroactive financing is to ensure a smooth flow of
commitments and payments during the transition period between the fourth and
fifth loans. In order to ensure that: Turkey will have ready access to foreign
exchange, a Special Account wouLd be established in the Central Bank of Turkey
to which the World Bank would make an initial revolving deposit of up to
$40 million. The establishment of the Special Account would be a condition of
loan effectiveness (Loan Agreement, Section 5.01). The Special Account would
be replenished against withdrawal applications at monthly intervals or as
appropriate when the undisburse<i balance of the Account falls below
$20 million. Imports would be rnade directly by actual users, with imports
costing $10 million or more procured through international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Certain commonly
traded commodities may be purchased through price quotations from organized
international commodity markets. All contracts of lesser value would be
awarded through normal trade channels on the basis of normal procurement
procedures of the public and private sector firms concerned. The procuremenl:
procedures of public sector firms provide for substantial international
bidding or shopping and are satisfactory. Firms in Turkey have adequate
choice of international suppliers to ensure reasonable availability and price.
Monitoring
119.     Monitoring of performance under the SALs involves essentially two
complementary and inter-related activities: a more general monitoring of the
progress on implementing the program and the monitoring of specific progress



- 44 -
as a condition of tranche release. The spec:ific conditions proposed for
release of the second tranche of $126 million include (Loan Agreement,
Schedule 1, para. 3 and Schedule 5);
(a) Completion of the preparation of a Fifth Five-Year Development
Plan compatible with the aims of the structural adjustment
program (para. 34);
(b) Satisfactory progress in carrying out and implementing the
results of a review of the public investment program (para. 49);
(c) Satisfactory progress in the elimination of quantitative
restrictions on imports and the rationalization of the tariff
structure (para. 64);
(d) Satisfactory progress based on the agreed plan of action for the
installation of a computerized debt management system (para. 71);
(e) Satisfactory progress on financial sector reforms (para. 82); and
(f) Satisfactory progress in the preparation of an energy action plan
(para. 90).
PART VI - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
120.     Through March 31, 1984 the Bank and IDA have lent $4,628.2 million 1/
to Turkey, through 77 projects.  Agriculture accounts for 18 percent of funds
lent, industry and DFCs for 28 percent, power for 16 percent, structural
adjustment and program loans for 29 percent, and urban development,
transportation, education, tourism and technical assistance for the remaining
9 percent. As of March 31, 1984, IFC commitments to Turkey totalled about
$240 million, of which about $74 million were still held by IFC. Annex II
provides a summary statement of Bank loans, I;DA credits and IFC investments as
of March 31, 1984.
121.     The execution of Bank-financed projects in the public sector has been
slow, due in part to weak management, limited coordination amongst ministries,
staffing problems, and the serious external and domestic financial crises from
1977 to 1979. There has been notable improvement since September 1980.
Nevertheless, problems persist in many cases, reflecting difficulties in
staffing the public sector at current salaries, over-centralized bureaucratic
structures and continuing constraints on the availability of local funds. The
high interest rates for working capital combined with depressed domestic
demand and reluctance of investors to take the foreign exchange risk have
affected the implementation of private sector projects and led to slow
commitments under DFC lending. As of December 31, 1983, disbursements for all
sectors combined average 44 percent of appraisal estimates (excluding
structural adjustment loans) as compared to 54 percent for Tunisia and
42 percent for Morocco.

- 45 -
122.     Bank lending is aimed at sulpporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of restructuring the Turkish economy by placing more reliance on market forces
and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. These objectives also include
increasing domestic savings and reorienting a restrained public investment
program to reflect the Government's priorities of completing ongoing projectis
faster and emphasizing quick-yielding new investments with positive balance of
payments impact. The main vehicle for the Bank's operational discussions with
the Government has been the structural adjustment lending (SAL) program.  Four
SALs have so far been approved, and the proposed loan would be the fifth. The
success of the SAL program has highlighted the need to develop sector policy
lending vehicles for continuing the 'policy dialogue at the sectoral level.
123.     Agriculture, industry, energy and transportation will continue to be
the key sectors for Bank lending with the accent being placed on improving t]he
management of projects. In agriculture, the emphasis will be on irrigation,
credit, and reform of the extension and research services. In industry
(including DFCs), it will be on the promotion of exports, employment, and
increasing operational efficiency. Energy projects under preparation will
focus on power generation based on domestic hydro and lignite resources, as
well as enhanced oil recovery and oil and gas exploration. Lending for the
transport sector will focus on developing the infrastructure necessary
to facilitate exports and improve the efficiency of operations. Projects for
industrial training, urban development and public utilities may supplement
these efforts.
124.     The close macroeconomic and sector dialogue established with the
Government in recent years is expected to be pursued. The economic and sector
work undertaken recently includes studies of the agricultural and financial
sectors. Topics likely to be covered in the future include a review of the
next five-year development plan, including a review of major public sector
projects, a study focussing on the impact of structural adjustment, a review
of transport investments and studies of the engineering and agro-industries.
125.     This is the sixth loan to Turkey to be presented to the Executive
Directors this fiscal year. Other projects being processed include a proposed
agricultural sector loan, supplementary loans for the Karakaya and Elbistan
projects, a natural gas pipeline and lignite mining.
126.     The Bank Group's share of the estimated total external debt was about
11 percent in 1982, and is expected to grow to about 16 percent by 1985; its
share of total debt service payments is projected to increase from about
12 percent in 1982 to about 15 percent in 1985.
127.     IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, textiles, pulp and paper, glass,
aluminum, cement, iron and steel products, heavy diesel engines, motor bicycle
engines, piston rings, food processing and tourism. It has also invested in
the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and provided guarantees for
overseas contracting firms. In addition, IFC is currently providing technical
assistance to the Government with respect to the development of the capital
market and a regulatory framework for leasing.

PART VII - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
128.     The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank
and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. Features of special interest are described in paras. 34, 49, 64,
71, 82, 90, 118 and 119 and listed in Section III of Annex III of this
Report. Establishment of a Special Account for the proposed revolving fund
would be a special condition of loan effectiveness (Loan Agreement,
Section 5.01).
129.     I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VIII - RECOMMENDATION
130.     I recommend that the Executive Direct:ors approve the proposed loan.

Mr. A. W. Clausen
President
International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development
Washington D.C.
Dear Mr. Clausen:
The Turkish Government has now completed the fourth year of the
program for restructuring the Turkish economy. The major
accomplishments in 1983 as well as our program for 1984 have been
summarized in the attached Statement of Development Policies.  Our
main objective is to curtail inflation and increase export earnings.
I am writing to you at this time to request a Fifth Structural
Adjustment Loan in the amount of $376 million during the Bank's 1984
Fiscal Year to support the Government's ongoing medium-term program
of structural change.
The attached Statement of Development Policies for 1984 outlines
the main elements of the Government's medium-term program for
structural adjustment and the measures under way or to be taken
during the year. These policies have been discussed in detail with
your staff.
Yours sincerely,
/s/Ismet Kaya Erdem
Deputy Prime Minister
and
Minister of State

STATEMENT OF DEVELOPMENT POLICIES - 1984
Introduction
1.       The economic reform program introduced on January 24, 1980 produced
positive results through the end of 1982. For example, exports increased
dramatically from $2.9 billion inL 1980 to $5.8 billion in 1982. Inflation,
which rose to over 100 percent in 1979/80, was reduced to 25 percent in 1982.
Moreover, during the period 1981-82 economic growth averaged about 4.3 percent.
2.       The positive trend was reversed in 1983.  Exports did not rise above
the 1982 level in value and the growth in GNP slowed to about 3 percent. Even
more serious, the rate of inflation accelerated to around 40 percent at the
year's end. The policy of setting interest rates for private savers above the
rate of inflation lagged behind events. Special measures were required to
assist commercial banks facing liquidity problems and as a result, other
government expenditures were reduced below the programmed level.
3.       The main objective of the Government's economic policy in the short
run is to bring inflation again under control. This is necessary to establish
a stable economic environment. In an economy which develops under stable
conditions, social issues are resolved more easily and more rapidly.
4.       The Government will pursue an economic system in which free market
rules predominate. The main function of the state in economic development
should be regulatory, helping to remove obstacles to the growth of
productivity. The direct activities of the state should be confined mainly to
the development of an infrastructure (including energy) that serves the nation
as a whole.
5.       The Government believes that changes should be made in administrative
and legal procedures to serve better the interests of the society and has
initiated such improvements. Procedures are being examined to permit the
introduction of new ideas and new incentives. The objective is to speed up
administrative processes and make them less wasteful of resources.
Economic Restructuring
6.       The Government has already taken a number of steps to broaden the
process of structural adjustment. Briefly they are:
(i)     a reorganization of the administrative machinery which,
inter alia, concentrates authority over economic affairs in the
Prime Minister's office;
(ii)     a substantial import liberalization;
(iii)     a rationalization of export incentives;



- 58 -
ANNEX IV-A
Page 3 of 7
(iv)   a liberalization of the foreign exchange regime;
(v)   an interest rate policy designed to provide a real rate of return
on savings while largely freeing lending rates to be set by the
commercial banks;
(vi)   a reduction in the financial transactions tax and the withholding
tax on interest payments; and
(vii)   a re-affirmation that, with some exceptions, SEEs will be free to
set their own prices.
7.       The medium-term framework for economic restructuring will be set out
in the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89) which will be submitted to
the Grand National Assembly in July 1984 . The Plan is intended to be
indicative in nature, linking the macro-economic strategy to be pursued with
the sectoral and sub-sectoral strategies. The new Plan will differ somewhat
from previous plans. The Government does nor intend to create a rigid
centralized framework for the development process. Instead it is the
Government's intention to promote an environment in which social and economic
objectives may be pursued in harmony. The Government intends to strengthen
indicative planning capability so that the puiblic investment program is
designed and implemented in a manner which facilitates the adoption of a free
market system. The following paragraphs present some details on the targets
that will be set for the main macro-economic indicators over the Plan period
together with a brief review of tlhe main policy objectives that will be
included.
The Basic Strategy
8.       The basic theme of the Plan will continue to be outward-oriented
development with an increased reliance on market forces. The Plan will define
the respective roles of the public and private sectors, with increasing
reliance placed on an efficient private sector as the engine of growth.
Private initiative and innovation along the lines of Turkey's comparative
advantage will be encouraged. The public sector will provide the
infrastructure required to allow the private sector to achieve its potential.
This shift in emphasis means that the Government will make greater use of
private sector participation in the planning committees.
9.       At the heart of the structural adjustment program is a development
strategy based on sustained export growth over the medium term. Such a
trategy requires that the private sector be allowed to play a leading role,
;ince export growth is critically dependent on private manufacturers
<leveloping their comparative advantage. Not only will the size of the Plan
have to be in line with the availability of domestic and foreign resources,
but in addition, the public investment program would have to be so designed
that it does not lead to a pre-empting of resources for the private sector.



- 59 -
ANNEX IV-A
Page 4 of 7
10.      The Government considers that the achievement of a satisfactory rate
of growth is essential to provide a stable economic environment. To encourage
the necessary level of private investment, the Government believes that
priority should be given to bringing inflation under control. This will
entail tight monetary and fiscal. policies designed to keep public expenditures
in line with public resources as they materialize. While the adjustment
process may involve hardship in the short run, it is designed to provide a
sounder economic base from which will emerge improvements in the standards of
living of the population over the medium term. The Government is aware that
certain shorter term social dislocations resulting from the structural
adjustment process have to be gradually eliminated. However, the medium-term
and longer-term benefits are cle!arly in favor of restructuring.
Key Targets of the Plan
11.      While it is premature to present any precise figures since these will
have to await approval of the Plan by the Grand National Assembly, some
indications can be given of the key targets that the Government would propose!
to include in the draft Plan. Sustaining the growth of exports is central to
the Plan and the Government envisages a target for the annual real growth of
merchandise exports during the next five years in the 8-11 percent range.
Given the low base from which the export drive started, and the Government's
commitment to the maintenance of a competitive exchange rate together with a
carefully designed set of trade incentives, this target is both realistic and
attainable.
12.      The size and composition of public investment will also receive
careful attention. It is the Government's objective that public investment
should increasingly be financed by public resources. Consequently, the size
of the public investment prograrn will be so regulated that the ratio of public
sector borrowing requirements to GNP declines over time, from about
3.5 percent in 1984. It is also the Government's intention to restore an
approximate balance between pubLic and private fixed investment in the medium
term. Given the public/private balance in 1984 of about 60/40, this implies a
growth rate of private fixed investment which is more than double that of
public fixed investment over the Plan period.
13.      In terms of the composition of public investment, energy, 1!
agriculture, and transport and communications would remain the priority
sectors. The share of total public ifixed investment to be allocated to these
sectors will be not less than the share achieved in 1983.  Within these
sectors, projects identified as of high priority will receive the bulk of the
allocations. At the same time, the Government will progressively withdraw
from new investments in manufacturing activities that can more efficiently be
carried on by the private sector.
1/ Including electricity, petroleum exploration and refining, coal and
lignite mining, and pipelines.



- 60 -
ANNEX IV-A
Page 5 of 7
14.      Within this framework, and under reasonable assumptions regarding
external capital flows, a target average annual GNP growth rate of about
6 percent is envisaged for the Plan period. The annual gross external capital
requirements to support this rate of growth will be compatible with a debt
service ratio 1/ averaging about 25 percent in the medium term.
15.      To summarize, the Government intends to prepare a Plan that does not
conflict with its fight against inflation, while at the same time pursuing a
growth strategy commensurate with its ability to generate resources. Should
the projected resources fail to materialize during the course of the Plan, the
Government will adjust its annual targets through the Annual Programs so as
not to jeopardize the gains to date from the structural adjustment process.
16.      An elaboration of the objectives under key components of the
medium-term program is presented in the succeeding paragraphs.
Monetary and Credit Policy
17.      The aims of monetary and credit policy are to reduce inflation,
improve the balance of payments and lay the basis for growth. Agreement has
been reached with the IMF on performance criteria for the monetary program
under a new one year Stand-By in the amount of SDR225 million which was signed
in April 1984. The Government is committed to a flexible exchange rate policy
to maintain external competitiveness.
18.      The aim of interest rate policy is to provide a real rate of return
on savings. However, lending rates remain high in real terms and therefore
tend to hinder investments. The Government's objectives in this area are to:
(i)   increase the role of the market in the determination of interest
rates;
(ii)   reduce the differences between the interest rates on preferential
and non-preferential credits; and
(iii)   encourage the availability of medium- and long-term credits for
the productive sectors of the economy.
State Economic Enterprises
19.      The Government believes that State Economic Enterprises should
provide the infrastructure and services required for the society as a whole.
But the State should not appropriate funds directly for investment in
activities that should be the province of the private sector. Thus the
Government will not normally undertake any new investment in SEEs operating in
1/ Total debt service as a proportion of exports of goods and non-factor
services plus workers' remittances.



- 61 -
ANNEX IV-A
Page 6 of 7
such areas. Moreover, the Government intends to explore opportunities for
converting selected SEE activities into joint stock ventures by offering such
stock to the public. The Government: does not, in principle, intend to protect
the monopoly status of any SEE in the industrial sector.
20.      With respect to all SEEs, the Government intends to take measures to
facilitate the recruitment of experienced and able management and provide for
appropriate remuneration for skilled SEE personnel. The Government also
intends to create an operational environment for SEEs in which managerial
decisions may be taken on the basis of sound economic, financial and technical
considerations. It follows that SEE managements will be called upon to meet
appropriate performance criteria, including target rates of return on assets
employed, according to the particular SEE and the sector in which it operates.
Import Liberalization
21.      The Government places considerable emphasis on bringing about a
structural change in the import substitution policy practised hitherto.
Industry cannot develop in a stable manner when protected by subsidies,
tariffs and import restrictions. Incentives should be afforded largely
through the exchange rate.
22.      Measures have already been taken to reduce drastically the
quantitative restrictions on imports and to reduce tariffs. Our objective
over the next few years is to complete the transition to a system relying
solely on tariffs and to undertake a rationalization of the tariff structure
to achieve significant uniform reduction in effective protection across
sectors, provided similar developments take place in the countries that are
Turkey's major trading partners.
Financial Sector
23.      The Government recognizes that an important determinant of the
success of the domestic resource mobilization effort as well as the revival of
private investment will be the effectiveness of changes being introduced in
the financial system. The Government's objectives are to restore and maintiain
confidence in the financial system and to expand its range, reduce the cost of
credit, improve the efficiency of credit allocation, allow more competition in
the financial sector, strengthen the institutions which supervise the
financial system and revitalize the capital market. Substantial improvements
have taken place in the financial sector as a result of the enactment of the
new Banking Law in June 1983, the clhanges introduced in the capital market and
recent measures to reduce the cost of intermediation through reduction of the
fiscal burden. In the banking sector actions will be taken to stimulate the
progressive reduction of excessive costs of bank intermediation, to promote an
inter-bank market and to introduce standardization of bank accounts.
Significant progress has been achieved in the capital market. Many
improvements in the organization, the regulations and the instruments of the
capital market have already been introduced or are being contemplated.
Further streamlining of selective credit practices is being considered in
order to reduce the high cost of credit for non-preferential borrowers.

Agriculture
24.      The Government will continue to promote increasing productivity and
growth of exports through encouraging a crop mix which better reflects
Turkey's comparative advantage. The outward orientation would include
movement towards freer trade, continued penetration of foreign markets,
general reduction of government intervention, rationalization of public
investment and parastatal reforms. Special measures will be taken to improve
the availability of credit, to eliminate gradually the subsidy on short-term
lending and to improve the administration and accountability of the sales
cooperatives. The Government would welcome art early opportunity to discuss
these objectives with the Bank with a view to formulating an agreed action
program as a basis for a proposed agricultural sector policy loan.
Energy
25.      The Government recognizes the criticalI importance of substantially
increased energy supplies for sustained econoulic: growth and the need to reduce
energy imports by increasing the efficient production of indigenous sources of
energy and by encouraging greater conservation. In the investment program,
highest priority will be accorded to investment in energy. A medium-term
energy action program is currently under consideration, and the Government
would welcome Bank assistance in the preparation and implementation of this
program. Emphasis will be placed on the completion of high priority,
economically viable projects with (lue consideration given to the
inzplementation capacities of the energy agencies and the availability of
financial resources. In the short-run the single most important issue is to
resolve the problems facing the Elbistan Project.
Conclusion
26.      The Government would welcome an opportunity to discuss the
aforementioned economic objectives and the public investment program with thes
World Bank before the second tranche release. The Government intends to take
the opportunity of the Plan preparation to undertake a detailed review of the
public investment program, especially the major programs and projects, with
the objective of speeding up the completion of high priority projects and
reducing or eliminating the allocations to projects of lower priority.
Pursuant to this process the Government intends to ask the World Bank for
financial support for speeding up the implementation of priority projects.
Policy Actions
27.      In the attachment to the Statement, the policy measures that the
Government intends to carry out in support of the medium-term objectives are
identified.
