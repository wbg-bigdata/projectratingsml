1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.       Country and Sector Background: At the time of project appraisal Ethiopia had a
population of over 72 million, 45 % of whom were under 15 years old. The first AIDS case
was reported in 1986 and by 2005 adult HIV prevalence had reached 1.4% (DHS+, 2005) –
5.5% urban, 0.7% rural. In 2007, an estimated 1.32 million people were infected, with over
130,000 new infections a year. The country had a mixed epidemic with HIV transmission
among both Most At-Risk Populations (MARPs), particularly Sex Workers (SWs) and their
clients, and the general population. Findings from an epidemiological synthesis study, carried
out with Bank support, highlighted the importance of addressing the epidemic in MARPs, and
were available to inform project design1. Life expectancy was falling as a result of the
epidemic, and was expected to drop to 50 years by 2010 (from a previous estimate of 59).

2.      Economic and social context: The economy is predominantly agricultural, 80% of the
population is rural (60 million), and in 2005 around 39% of Ethiopians were living below the
poverty line. AIDS had become the leading cause of mortality in 15-49 year olds (43% of all
adult deaths), and was seen as a major threat to economic growth and poverty alleviation.
Major factors thought to contribute to the epidemic included poverty, illiteracy, widespread
transactional sex, gender disparity, population movement and harmful traditional practices
such as Female Genital Mutilation. There was a significant difference in infection rates
between men and women (seven times higher in 15-19 year old girls).

3.       Rationale for Bank assistance: This project built upon successful completion of the
first Ethiopian Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Project (EMSAP1) launched in 2001 and closed in
December 2006. There was a recognized need to further scale up appropriate interventions for
a number of years, and to increase the focus on MARPs, in order to see declines in prevalence
and incidence and to reduce the impact on life expectancy and economic growth. EMSAP1
had effectively supported general awareness of HIV and AIDS, and some change in sexual
behavior (such as condom use in high risk settings) but not at a sufficiently high level.

4.      EMSAP1 had played a key role in building an effective national response and creating
an enabling environment for decentralized HIV activities. Financial resources for the
response had increased substantially by 2007 with significant amounts of Global Fund and
PEPFAR funding (GF and PEPFAR commitments for 2007 totaled $250 million, of which
$130m was for ART and $109m for OVC support, condoms and PMTCT). However, there
remained a crucial gap in support for comprehensive prevention programs2. Bank support was
needed to partially cover this gap, and improve national program delivery and utilization of all
resources. The Bank therefore decided to continue to finance prevention interventions and
support to improve public and private sector institutional capacity. Particular emphasis was
given to targeting communities not already reached and MARPs, and helping government
implement prioritized, targeted and focused interventions.

  FHAPCO estimated that US$19.5 billion would be needed to reach the HIV/AIDS MDG by 2015.
5.      The project was designed in a context of strong government commitment, based on a
multisectoral Strategic Plan for Management (SPM - revised in 2004), supported by all
development partners. Federal and Regional HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Offices
((F)HAPCOs) were established to coordinate and guide the national response with oversight
provided by a Management Board chaired by the Minister of Health. There was a good
working relationship between FHAPCO and the MoH (in 2005, the MoH integrated its
HIV/AIDS and other STIs Prevention and Control Unit into HAPCO, further strengthening
overall national program coordination within one institution). The country complied with the
―Multi-country AIDS Programs repeater requirements‖3 with the exception of one
comprehensive M&E system. EMSAP1 had, however, helped establish an M&E unit in
FHAPCO, and it was stated that the project would support improvements to the system.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

6.      The project development objectives were to: (i) increase access to prevention services
for youth, in particular females aged 15-24, and other most-at-risk groups and (ii) sustain
access to care and support for PLWHA and orphans undertaken in EMSAP1.

7.      PDO indicators were: (i) increased percentage of young people aged 15-24 who both
correctly identify ways of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and who reject major
misconceptions about HIV transmission; (ii) increased percentage of young women and men
aged 15-24 reporting the use of a condom during (last) sexual intercourse with a non-regular
partner (of those reporting sexual intercourse with a non-regular partner in the last 12
months); (iii) increased percentage of sex workers who report using a condom with their most
recent client (of those surveyed having sex with any clients in the last 12 months);
(iv) increased percentage of people aged 15 and older undergoing voluntary HIV counseling
and testing (depending on expected changes to the National Policy, otherwise 18 and older);
(v) increased percentage of woredas that are supporting effective PLWHA groups and
associations and implementing community programs to support orphans; and (vi)
establishment of an HIV/AIDS information and M&E system that supports improved policy
and program decision making.

  (i) One national HIV/AIDS Strategy and one national HIV/AIDS authority; (ii) a comprehensive national M&E
system for HIV/AIDS; (iii) willingness to use simplified implementation procedures; and (iv) willingness to
integrate performance considerations into fund allocation and disbursement decisions.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.       The project targeted youth aged 15-24 years, particularly young women (who had
significantly higher rates of infection than young men), and other MARPs, especially SWs and
their clients, farmers, migrant workers, and military personnel. It was stated that there would
be a focus on rural and peri-urban areas and specific ―hot-spots‖.

10.     It was noted at the time that there was little information (in what was a difficult
cultural, political and religious context) about Men who have Sex with Men (MSM). There
were plans to use PEPFAR funds to carry out an assessment of the HIV status of this group.
Since project design, some small scale studies have been published:
- a small ethnographic study published in 2009 suggested that MSM are an at-risk
population needing policy and program attention4;
- another study, quoted in an MoH/UNFPA desk review (2009) shared these concerns
pointing out that ―[a]part from the high-risk behavior of MSM, … [there is] the possibility of
cross bridging of the HIV epidemic to the heterosexual community because of dual sexual
orientation of some gay people (bisexuality)5;‖
- the Epidemiological Synthesis [referred to above] noted that ―… this population is
essentially unstudied in Ethiopia. After many years of denial, evidence is emerging about
MSM populations in other East African countries, so it is likely that they exist in Ethiopia as
well, and are probably at even greater risk because of stigma and lack of access to services‖.

1.5     Original Components

11.     Component 1: National Program Coordination and Institutional Strengthening
(Appraisal estimate US$2.5 million): The objective of this component was to further improve
the coordination and delivery of the national HIV/AIDS strategy and action plan at all levels
more effectively. Activities carried out under this component sought to improve the
implementation capacity of public sector entities as well as private sector and civil society
organizations to ensure effective coordination and to achieve better results on the ground.
Project support aimed to address key capacity gaps in line with the national capacity building
program. Particular emphasis was placed on strengthening the monitoring and evaluation
system. Expected results included establishment of restructured federal and regional HAPCOs
and a fully functional M&E system.

12.     Component 2: Multi-Sectoral Prevention Fund (Appraisal estimate US$3.5 million):
This component aimed to support a broad range of public sector interventions to prevent HIV
spread including: peer education, counseling and testing, condom distribution, and
mechanisms for reduction of harmful traditional practices. Specific attention was to be paid to
integration of HIV/AIDS in reproductive health interventions. Financial support would be
provided through a competitive process based on submission of proposals by the respective
ministries and agencies.

community and woreda-based initiatives delivering evidence-based HIV prevention and
mitigation activities targeting specific key at-risk groups. Appropriate targeting was to be
based on the epidemiological synthesis study published in April 2008. Activities included:
HIV/AIDS awareness creation; behavioral change (reduction of traditional harmful practices;
safer sexual behavior by both SWs and their clients; delayed first sexual intercourse; reduction
in early marriage; reduced sex with non-regular partners); condom distribution; and
counseling and testing services.

1.6 Revised Components

14.    The original components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

15.     The project was restructured twice: (i) $5 million of the total credit was cancelled in
December 2008. These funds were reallocated to the Food Crisis Response Program. This
was in response to a request from Government in October 2008, but also took note of the slow
disbursement rate; (ii) the closing date was extended, at no additional cost, from 07/02/2011 to
09/30/2011, to allow for completion of an ongoing survey to assess the status of the PDO
indicators (necessary because of an unexpected delay in publication of the DHS results). Both
restructurings were second level, and were approved by the Country Director.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Preparation

16.      A project identification mission in June 2006 undertook a detailed assessment of the
epidemiological situation, critical response needs, contributions from other development
partners, and the Bank’s comparative advantage. The mission team included a full range of
development partners (including the Donor Group Co-chair, UNAIDS and key co-sponsors,
and DFID). Consultations were held with government agencies (FHAPCO; sector ministries),
other donors, and civil society. Project design reflected a request by the Minister of Health
that the project should: support multi-sectoral interventions, capacity building, and creation of
an enabling environment for the proper implementation of treatment, care and support; and
give priority to prevention among high risk groups with particular emphasis to rural areas.
The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) highlighted the importance of addressing stigma and
discrimination as a key element of an enabling environment, but it is noted that this would be
a long-term undertaking.

17.    It was clear that the Bank could not close the huge financing gap but should focus on
programmatic areas in which incremental finances could result in critical or significant
additional benefits. The evidence to guide prevention related interventions was based on a
well documented assessment of effectiveness. It was noted that many current support


                                                   4
programs had a rather short timeframe (subject to annual review in some cases) for their
financial commitments. The project was designed to provide flexible support over three years,
in order to mitigate the risk of any abrupt changes in the resource envelope.

18.     Lessons learnt and reflected in the project design: The project design reflected
important lessons from EMSAP1, including the need for: a) continued targeting of high-risk
areas and most-at-risk groups, with renewed focus on prevention activities; b) interventions to
promote greater male responsibility and to reduce inter-generational sex; c) a strong national
coordination entity, with further capacity support to FHAPCO; d) partner coordination: it was
agreed that FHAPCO would review the effectiveness of the various fora and move towards
one national Partnership Forum; e) need for an annual joint review and budgeting process
enabling Government to plan and allocate resources according to the country’s needs;
f) integration of health and HAPCO M&E systems; g) a rigorous assessment of the major
transmission dynamics and potential evolution of the epidemic; and analysis of the current
responses in relation to this; h) capacity building of communities, woredas and civil society
and i) strengthened financial planning and reporting mechanisms. There is undeniable
evidence that the male circumcision reduce the risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV
infection. Since over 90% of Ethiopian men are circumcised, male circumcision was not
considered as a critical element of HIV/AIDS prevention in Ethiopia and therefore was not
included among the agreed activities.

19.     Risks and their mitigation: PAD identified important risks6 and proposed measures to
mitigate these. These measures were generally appropriate, and effective risk management
reduced the impact. FHAPCO, as implementing agency, carried out annual financial reviews
and gap analysis to ensure implementation of HIV/AIDS related interventions within the
resources available. FHAPCO also provided leadership and coordinated HIV activities
throughout the country in accordance with its mandate as the single national authority on
HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia. However, it proved difficult to maintain trained and experienced staff,
particularly in the light of an ongoing civil service reform process (the BPR, see below); scale
up to an additional 150 woredas added to the difficulty. This risk was partially mitigated
through support to training and capacity building using project funds, but staffing constraints
did impact on project performance. The PAD rated overall risk of the project as substantial.
The ICR team agrees with this assessment.

20.     Adequacy of government’s commitment, stakeholder involvement and participatory
processes: Government, as represented by FHAPCO, was closely involved in identification of
project objectives, and had accorded HIV and AIDS a high level of priority at the time of
project preparation. There was broad stakeholder consultation on project design, including
UN agencies, multilateral and bilateral donors, NGOs and CSOs.


6
 (i) failure to sustain and expand government commitment; (ii) program resources may be manipulated for
personal ends or special interests; (iii) maintaining trained and experienced staff; (iv) unpredictable flow of
donor finance; (v) complacency [about the seriousness of the epidemic]; (vi) Ministry of Health Leadership; (vii)
gap filling nature of the Project; (viii) scaling up decentralization of the HIV program would increase the risk of
monitoring results and having relevant skills mix.



                                                             5
21.     There was no formal Quality at Entry Review.

2.2 Implementation

22.     Positive factors affecting implementation included: the short time interval between
closure of the previous project (EMSAP 1) and project effectiveness (six months); effective
coordination structures, with a fully operational FHAPCO and plans to strengthen the staffing
of regional HAPCOs; and a single national plan, the Strategic Plan for Management,
providing the framework for all interventions. An effective social mobilization strategy,
including the ―community conversations‖ program7, provided a sound base for delivery of the
Local Response Fund (LRF). Continuity of Bank staff (the same Task Team Leader since
development of EMSAP 1) ensured that institutional knowledge was maintained.

23.     Several factors impacted negatively on project implementation, particularly in the
early years: there was still limited understanding of the epidemic with respect to MARPS
(with lack of clarity as to which populations were most at risk, or whether community
organisations were best placed to provide services to them) making it difficult for HAPCO to
prioritize, plan and manage prevention interventions; completion of a Business Process Re-
Engineering (BPR) exercise to identify key structural weaknesses in the HAPCO setup was
delayed by a year, resulting in high staff turnover and sub-optimal FHAPCO performance;
there was limited capacity within project teams particularly for procurement and financial
management, and in the newly added woredas (exacerbated by high rates of staff turnover);
and the project documents had not made it clear that community-based disbursement
procedures applied to the LRF, resulting in overly cumbersome procurement procedures and
slow disbursement.

24.     It was agreed to increase already high EMSAP1 coverage levels, adding a further 150
woredas8 to the 266 woredas already supported. The project covered approximately 50% of
the country’s population. All woredas were included in five key regions (Addis Ababa, Afar,
Dire Dawa, Harari, Tigray). Project scale up slowed implementation (see Risks, #18 above) but
increase in coverage is likely to have contributed significantly to project impact. Completion of
the BPR resulted in an increase in delegation of authority to decentralized levels, which is likely
to have strengthened community and woreda initiatives.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design

25.     The PAD included a set of 6 PDO and 10 Intermediate Outcome indicators. It was
noted that some of these could be measured at least annually and others only at the end of the
project. An appropriate mix of outcome and output level indicators was chosen to support and
assess project and program management. It was stated that three of the PDO indicators (VCT

uptake; numbers of woredas supporting PLWHA groups and OVCs; establishment of an
information and M&E system) were measured regularly. Good baseline data was available for
the other three measures (relating to knowledge of HIV transmission, and condom use)
required population based surveys.

M&E Implementation and Utilization
26.    It was recognized that considerable inputs would be needed to support the national
M&E system: integration of the HAPCO and health management information systems;
system decentralization to enable regions and woredas to monitor performance; capacity
building; and Community Information System (CIS) development to address the needs of
vulnerable communities. The project design underestimated the level of inputs and time
which would be needed to have an effectively functioning and fully integrated system. The
system could not generate data for 8 out of the 16 indicators until the mid-point of the project.

27.    FHAPCO was expected to develop, pilot test and implement a system to collect
community-based and program monitoring information. A CIS manual and format to capture
non- health indicators was designed and pilot tested but was not fully implemented.

28.     The project planned to support and develop national and regional M&E centers of
excellence (to provide capacity building and collect data for FHAPCO) but this was not fully
implemented, limiting the capacity of the M&E system to generate essential monitoring data.
Donors had different M&E requirements and approaches to capacity building, and lack of
harmonization created difficulties for FHAPCO. However, by the time of the Mid-Term
Review it was noted that FHAPCO had made progress in capacity strengthening and
development of systems to monitor and evaluate progress towards the project objectives, as
well as the wider national AIDS response. Development of the Health Management
Information System (HMIS), the Manual for Project Monitoring and Evaluation, and the
FHAPCO database and website were recognized as important steps towards the ―one national
M&E system‖. Completion of the BPR process guided efforts to strengthen FHAPCO's HR
capacity for M&E, and staff were in post at federal, regional and woreda levels.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

29.     Environment. The project did not trigger any major concerns related to the Bank’s
safeguards policy. It was noted that health facilities had provision for disposal of medical
waste, and no significant negative impacts were anticipated. ISRs consistently rated the
project satisfactory for overall safeguards compliance and in respect of operational policy
OP4.01 (Environmental Assessment).

30.     Financial management and procurement. There was ongoing concern over the
financial management of the project for the first two years of implementation, and it was
consistently scored Moderately Unsatisfactory. The main issues were recurrent delays in the
submission of Interim Financial Reports (IFRs), audit reports and Statements of Expenses
(SoEs). The issue of perennially late audits was recognized to be a government-wide issue,
well beyond the remit of this particular project. The audit for the fiscal year ending July 2007
was qualified due to the substantial amount of unjustified expenditure. The situation


                                                   7
improved significantly by mid 2009: the government submitted a plan of action to respond to
issues raised by auditors over the 2006/2007 audit, and the 2008/2009 audit report was being
prepared. Financial management performance was rated Satisfactory by the end of the
project. Procurement weaknesses and absence of federal and regional procurement plans
were noted during the first year of implementation, but performance improved over time.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

31.     There is concern that current levels of financing, particularly from the Global Fund
and PEPFAR, will not be sustained in the longer term. The government and civil society
have limited resources and capacity to sustain the levels of inputs and services which will be
needed for prevention and the growing demand for treatment. There is an urgent need to
identify other sources of funding, including increased government appropriations and
community contributions.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

32.     Relevance of objectives: The project objectives focused on provision of HIV
prevention interventions to MARPs, and particularly young women. This was highly
appropriate for several reasons: there was a continued high incidence of new infections in the
country, particularly in young women (who were seven times more likely than young men to
become infected); there was also a concentrated epidemic in sex workers; and rising infection
rates in rural areas (home to over 85% of the population) raised a valid concern that there
could be a rapid increase in the burden of disease and a heavy socio-economic burden.
Internationally recognized best practice supported prioritization in those high-risk populations
identified as the drivers of the epidemic. However, the PDOs could have been more specific
in definition of the target groups, including: the subset of young women who reported having
multiple sex partners; sex workers as the primary MARP of concern; and older men (both as
clients of sex workers, and as the source of the excess of infections in young women). This
would have strengthened targeting and led to the selection of more focused PDO indicators.
The PDOs were consistent with the government’s development priorities as reflected in the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy. On this basis
the relevance of objectives is rated Substantial.

33.      Relevance of design and implementation: The design built upon that of EMSAP1,
and incorporated current international experience on HIV and AIDS with its focus on most-at-
risk groups in higher risk areas. It also reflected significant inputs from other development
partners, particularly the Global Fund and PEPFAR, who were supporting rapid treatment
access expansion. HAPCO, for example, received more than $300 million for HIV/AIDS from
the Global Fund, which meant that the project had to be particularly strategic in its choices.
The project aimed to partially cover the gap in prevention, and to improve national program
delivery and utilization of all resources, through improved public and private sector
institutional capacity. Particular emphasis was given to partner coordination and a well-
functioning M&E system integrating the HAPCO and health systems. Design also noted the


                                                   8
need for better epidemiological analysis and use of data for decision-making; and for
strengthened financial reporting.

34.     The choice of project components addressing program coordination and institutional
strengthening, multi-sectoral prevention, and community and woreda-based initiatives,
provided a relevant design and implementation framework. The PAD proposed a broad list of
types of activities to be financed by the LRF, but did not provide any guidance as to the choice
of activities nor on how these should be implemented. Work with Woreda and Kebele
HAPCOs was appropriate, allowing for implementation to be managed at a highly
decentralized level. 417 out of 800 Woredas (approximately 50% of the population) were
covered, with an effective balance between urban centers (containing many higher risk ―hot-
spots‖) and rural areas. Alternative designs were rejected for well-considered reasons
(including the need to respond to a changing epidemiological situation, and to maximize
impact of prevention through the most efficient use of limited funds). Providing considerable
autonomy to local stakeholders to design programs that were culturally sensitive was a
reasonable approach in the context.

35.     On the basis of the above the relevance of design and implementation would have been
rated high. However, there was insufficient emphasis put on reaching those most-at-risk
populations identified at the project appraisal. The time and levels of input needed to
establish a fully integrated M&E system were also underestimated. The relevance of design
and implementation is rated substantial.

36.   Based on high relevance of objectives and substantial relevance of design and
implementation, overall relevance is rated substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

37.       Assessment of PDO achievements has been made difficult because of unforeseen and
continued delays in availability of the full DHS report. The Task Team took appropriate steps
to fill the information gaps, by supporting FHAPCO to commission a dedicated survey9. A
preliminary DHS report has recently been made available, providing some of the required
information (on young women and men’s knowledge of transmission and use of condoms in
high-risk settings).

        Access to prevention services

38.     The preliminary DHS report provides good evidence that levels of knowledge of
sexual transmission of HIV have been maintained or increased amongst young people: the
proportion of women aged 15-24 who state that HIV infection can be prevented by using
condoms has increased by over a third during the project period (from 47% to 62%); 81% of
young men are aware of this (up from 66% in 2005); the percentages who know that infection
can be prevented by remaining faithful to one uninfected partner have not changed
significantly (for young women an increase from 66% to 68%; for young men a small

decrease from 76% to 74%). Overall, knowledge of HIV prevention methods has increased
since 2005, especially among women. According to the 2005 EDHS, 35 percent of women
knew that HIV could be prevented by using a condom and by limiting sexual partners; this
compares with 43 percent in 2011. Among men age 15-49, this percentage increased from 57
percent in 2005 to 64 percent in 2011. The same groups have also maintained or increased
rates of condom use in high-risk sex situations: of particular note is that the reported use of
condoms by women in high risk settings has more than doubled from 27% to 62% (but it
should be noted that this is based on very small sample sizes – only 0.5% of women said that
they had had two or more partners in the last 12 months). Support for these positive findings
comes from the dedicated survey referred to above: 83% of young men and 79% of young
women mentioned abstinence, faithfulness to one partner and condom use as effective
prevention methods and rejected common misconceptions about infection transmission; 86%
of those young men reporting transactional sex stated that they had used a condom during the
last such encounter. A summary of the methodology and results from the study carried out in
35 woredas is included in Annex 7.

39.     The percentage of female sex workers reporting condom use with their most recent
client was already very high at baseline (96.6%). The survey referred to above reported that
the target of 98% of condom use was met. This does not tally with the percentage of young
men reporting condom use in transactional sex, and the result should be viewed with caution.
However, there is good evidence of increase in condom use rates overall, with an increase in
the number of condoms distributed from 70 million (in the year ended July 2008) to 173
million in the year to July 2011 (exceeding the agreed target of 140 million).

40.     Underlying these broadly positive results (and based on the assumption that awareness
of one’s HIV status will act to reinforce positive prevention behaviors) has been a huge
increase in the percentage of people aged 15 and older undergoing voluntary HIV counseling
and testing. The baseline number tested in 2005 was 564,000 (FHAPCO Annual HIV/AIDS
M&E Report); a target of 700,000 was set for year three of implementation; by the end of the
project in 2011, an estimated 9.8 million tests had been carried out (it should be noted that
there is no information on how many of these were repeat tests). This was the result of a
massive push by the government to expand testing throughout the country (the millennium
development campaign) using EMSAP2, Global Fund and PEPFAR resources.

        Access to care and support

41.     At project completion over 95% of woredas reported that they were supporting
effective PLWHA groups and associations and implementing community programs to support
orphans. FHAPCO reported that assistance had been provided to over 100,000 PLWHA and
350,000 orphans. This included provision of food and shelter, income generating training and
start up capital, and educational support for orphans. This support occurred in the context of a
marked reduction in stigma and discrimination10(though it should be noted that high levels of
stigma and discrimination persist).

42.     The sixth PDO indicator was ―establishment of an HIV/AIDS information and M&E
system that supports improved policy and program decision making‖. This took a
considerable amount of time to achieve: at the time of the project Mid-Term Review (May
2009) it was noted that the system was clearly defined in the Project Implementation Manual
and the ―Final Manual for Monitoring and Evaluation of EMSAP2 and Global Fund Projects‖.
Staff and funding were in place, and there was evidence of use of data in strategic decision
making, but weaknesses were also apparent, including poor aggregation of data, weak data
quality verification, and lack of system capacity to assess MARP program effectiveness.
However, it was judged that this indicator had been fully met by mid 2010, following
strengthening and roll out of the Health Management and Community Information Systems.

43.      The PAD acknowledged that whilst the World Bank would not continue to be ―the
major funding agency in the fight against HIV/AIDS, its continued involvement is still
believed to be critical …. particularly in the areas of prevention...‖. Support to prevention had
previously been mainly limited to urban areas, but there was growing evidence that the
epidemic was increasingly affecting rural populations. The project made a substantial
contribution to the national response in key areas by: (i) maintaining the focus on MARPs,
building on the Epidemiological Synthesis (and helping to overcome a perceived reluctance
on the part of government to work with these groups); (ii) strengthening and expanding
institutional capacity, particularly within HAPCOs (which continued to function during the
lengthy BPR reorganization process); (iii) strengthening a policy and institutional framework
to enable effective and rapid mobilization of funds from other sources (the Global Fund and
PEPFAR); (iv) providing funds to civil society through the LRF to, inter alia, sustain the
Community Conversations (an effective mechanism to spread prevention messages, and
address stigma and discrimination) and ensure that the program reached rural areas.

44.      The limitations of HIV prevalence as an indicator of program achievement are well
recognized, and the PDO rightly focused on access to prevention services. However, it should
be noted that ―[a]t the national level, the epidemiologic trend over the past eight years has
been stable… [and] HIV prevalence appears to be declining in urban areas, according to
analysis of data from ANC sites that collected data consistently for more than ten years‖11.
This would suggest that prevention related interventions are having a significant impact at the
population level, given the significant increase in access to treatment (which serves to
maintain prevalence rates) during the same period. The possibility remains that this positive
national level trend is masking continued high transmission rates and increased prevalence in
MARPs, underlying the need for careful monitoring of the epidemic and sustained prevention
efforts.

45.     On the basis of the available evidence we conclude that the project has successfully
achieved the targets set for the PDO indicators. The achievement of project development
objectives is rated Substantial.

3.3 Efficiency

46.     Highly cost-effective interventions were selected for implementation using project
funds12. Several key interventions had a cost-effectiveness of US$100 per HIV infection
averted or less (a commonly-used threshold for cost-effectiveness) including: voluntary
testing and counseling (US$34-161 per DALY averted); peer-based programs to educate
higher-risk groups, including sex workers and youth (US$11-74 per DALY averted); and
promotion, and distribution of condoms (US$39-305 per DALY averted).

47.     Allocative efficiency was increased by the use of comprehensive and up to date
epidemiological information derived from the Epidemiological Synthesis Study. Based on
this knowledge of the drivers of the epidemic emphasis was placed on reaching youth,
particularly young women, seen as highly vulnerable, and sex workers in locations previously
not recognized as epidemiologically important (including small towns and rural areas). The
operating costs for the project increased about five times over the initial allocation to about
20% of the disbursed credit. This was partly due to the increase of the number of woredas
from 226 to about 416 as well as an initial under-estimate of the resources required to carry
out decentralized HIV activities.

48.     There are no recent studies or data available to allow for a meaningful a posteriori
economic and financial analysis of project implementation. However, it is recorded that the
project has satisfactorily achieved its targets. In this regard even if it could not be quantified,
most of the activities carried out by the communities had a potential for reducing the cost for
prevention. An economic cost and benefit analysis was performed during the Project
appraisal process, focusing on HIV prevention activities. Even though microeconomic
benefits are difficult to quantify, on the basis of the existing evidence, stabilization and
subsequent fall in the HIV prevalence rate will be likely to increase the growth rate of GDP
per capita, and a reduction in AIDS-related deaths and morbidity will increase the country’s
labor force, which in turn would contribute to increasing GDP growth. A recent analysis of the
economic benefits of community-based preventive activities supported through the project
considered: (a) behavior change interventions at community level; (b) counseling and testing;
and (c) condom distribution. The increase in condom use and consequent reduction in
unprotected sex in the general population was found to be the main source of the estimated
economic benefits derived from the project implementation, with a benefit/cost ratio of
between 1.99 and 2.43. [See Annex 3]

49.     Based on the emphasis placed on highly cost-effective interventions, and increasing
allocative efficiency (see OED 's analysis regarding the principal elements contributing to the
efficiency of the MAPs13), project efficiency is rated as Substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
50.     Rating: Based on the above presented data on the relevance of the project’s objectives,
design, and implementation (Substantial), achievement of PDOs (Substantial) and efficiency
(Substantial), the overall outcome rating of the project is Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

a)     Poverty impacts, gender aspects and social development

51.     Poverty Impacts. The project was a major contributor to efforts to prevent spread of
the epidemic and reduce the number of new infections. Although there were no formal studies
of the Socio-Economic Impact of the epidemic, project support is likely to have led to a
reduced burden of AIDS-related illness, particularly in adults of working age, and it can be
expected that this will have had a positive impact on earning capacity and household wealth.

52.     Gender Aspects. The PAD highlighted the particular risk of infection facing young
women and SWs, identified the main factors underlying this, and set out ways in which the
issues would be addressed. As a result, the project had a major focus on young women and
female sex workers, as set out in the PDO and reflected in the PDO indicators. Although there
continue to be gender differences in project outcomes (as seen, for example, in levels of
knowledge of the epidemic) improvements in these outcomes have been seen for both women
and men. The government’s ICR states that poor women were targeted to receive income
generating support (in the form of training, start-up working capital and links to micro-
finance, though there is no information available on the extent to which these women were
able to participate in design and management of such support programs.

53.     Social Development. The project built upon a highly effective social mobilization
strategy, the ―community conversations‖ program, which was considered to have resulted in
increased awareness of HIV/AIDS, improved participation of women, greater support for
PLWHAs and OVCs, and a decrease in tolerance of customary practices such as multiple
sexual relationships. There was at least one conversation group in each kebele where 50
participants met twice per month to discuss responses to the epidemic. The Local Response
Fund (component 3) helped to expand these community level initiatives, which significantly
reduced stigma and discrimination, and reached marginalized segments of the population.

54.     A large study of PLWHA, carried out by the Network of Networks of HIV Positives in
Ethiopia found ―.. a general feeling among [respondents] that the level of stigma is declining
and less virulent than the situation five years ago‖. The study also found relatively low levels
of discrimination against those affected and their children in school settings, and survey
respondents expressed higher levels of confidence in health personnel than other groups.
There remain major areas of concern: the high levels of poverty reported by those living with
HIV and AIDS (95% of women and 93% of men); the ―institutionalization‖ of discrimination
(eg the widely reported charging of higher rents to those known to be HIV positive;



                                                  13
discriminatory employment practices, including loss of work; bureaucratic obstacles to legal
action to enforce rights); and low levels of awareness of basic rights amongst PLWHA.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
55.     The strengthening of HAPCOs established with the support of EMSAP1 has been a
significant institutional development, laying the foundations for a sustained national response.
Community involvement was broadened and deepened, through LRF support to creation and
development of civil society organizations, and further institutionalization of the ―community
conversations‖. Essential instruments for coordination, management and implementation
were developed (including the Financial and Procurement Manuals, and technical guidelines
and manuals for eg Anti-Retroviral Treatment, HIV Counseling and Testing (HCT),
Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission). The EMSAP1 and Global Fund Project
Coordination Units (PCUs) were formally closed by FHAPCO but provided the basis for the
current unified system of grant management, guided by the grant management manual
developed with Bank support.

(c) Focus on Most At Risk Populations

56.     A major achievement of the project was to ensure a sustained focus on Most At Risk
Populations. This was based on a sound epidemiological assessment as part of project
preparation (and drawing on EMSAP1 experience), further supported by an important
epidemiological study ―HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia: An Epidemiological Synthesis‖ carried out
with project support in 2007. The study confirmed that ―young populations, especially never-
married sexually active females have the greatest risk of HIV infection in the country‖ and
noted that ―discordant couples are also a concern, pointing to a clear need for couple
counseling services‖. The study also noted that ―traditional high-risk groups such as sex
workers seem to be reducing some of their risky behaviors‖. This was a clear endorsement of
the project approaches and development objectives: it confirmed the value of the emphasis
placed on expansion of HCT; and also underlined the importance of interventions addressing
sex-workers and their clients.

57.     An evaluation of the second SPM14 completed in Feb 2009 reaffirmed the focus on
MARPs, observing that ―high risk groups are increasing in number and type: college students
and MSM are increasingly recognized as most-at-risk population groups‖. The project Mid-
Term Review carried out in March 2009 noted the importance of assessing the effectiveness
of interventions for these groups, the need to increase prevention activities targeted to MARPs
relative to those for the general population, and agreed that a national survey of MARPs
(updating the Epidemiological Synthesis study carried out in 2007) would be carried out that
year (there is no record that this survey took place). This reflected some initial concerns over
government reluctance to discuss and provide targeted prevention services for sex workers
(most notably condoms). The project made a major contribution to discussion of this issue
and provision of these services.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

58.    The major risk to the Development Outcome is continued financing of Ethiopia’s
response to the epidemic at levels sufficient to ensure that prevention efforts will be
maintained. EMSAP2 was not a major source of funding in the context of overall funding, but
played a very important role in ensuring an ongoing focus on prevention. Wider funding
constraints (particularly the uncertainty over future levels of resources from the Global Fund)
could impact negatively on the national response and sustainability of the progress achieved.
The risk to Development Outcome is therefore rated High.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

59.     Project design built upon lessons learned from the first project (EMSAP1) and on other
lessons learned from the implementation of similar projects in other countries. The project
appraisal process was inclusive of a wide range of stakeholders, including Government, Civil
Society and a full range of development partners. The design team had confirmed that the
project was recognized as a priority by government, that government was fully committed to
implementation, and that the design was fully consistent with national policies and strategies
(as encapsulated in the Strategic Plan for Management).

60.     Institutional arrangements were agreed with the Government: program management
offices (HAPCOs) had been established at all levels (Federal, Woreda and Kebele), and
training had been provided in project planning and implementation. Project manuals,
including the Project Implementation Manual (PIM), Financial Manual and Procurement
Manual were prepared. These documents fully set out the arrangements for release of funds to
Regions and Woredas. They were disseminated and discussed at a national project launch
workshop held in July 2007, and follow up launch meetings for regions, woredas and NGOs.

61.     However, although over 60% of project funds were allocated to support community
and woreda-based initiatives through the LRF, the Financial Manual did not make it clear that
community-based disbursement procedures would apply. The resulting cumbersome
procedures required to justify community based expenditures resulted in slow disbursement
and impeded effective implementation during project start-up. Project design underestimated
the inputs and time needed to develop a fully effective M&E system (leading to lack of data
for half the project indicators until project mid-point).

62.     The many positive design features are noted. Slow disbursement of the LRF had a
major impact in the early part of the project, and there were issues with M&E throughout. On
this basis, Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory.




                                                 15
(b) Quality of Supervision

63.     The Bank’s country office had a full project team led by an experienced Task Team Leader (who
had also led the team on design and implementation of EMSAP1). This allowed for effective and
supportive supervision from the start of the project. Additional support was provided by the
Bank’s headquarters, particularly the AIDS Campaign Team for Africa (ACTafrica) and the
Global HIV/AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation Team (GAMET), who provided valuable
assistance during the course of project execution, including high-level field level participation
in the project Mid-Term Review.

64.     No formal Quality of Supervision assessment was carried out. However, a review of
project documentation confirms that the task team undertook regular supervision missions,
prepared Aide-Memoires, alerted government and FHAPCO to problems with project
execution, and facilitated remedies in a timely manner, in conformity with Bank procedures.
The Implementation Status and Results reports (ISRs) realistically rated project performance.
The task team also monitored safeguard and fiduciary compliance. Financial management and
audit issues were identified and brought to the attention of government, and were eventually
resolved through the persistent and patient efforts of the country team.

65.    Rating: on the basis of the above the Bank performance on quality of supervision is
rated Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

66.     Based on the moderately satisfactory rating for quality at entry and satisfactory rating
for quality of supervision, overll Bank Performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

67.      Federal and Regional governments had accorded HIV and AIDS a high level of
priority at the time of project preparation. They continued to build upon and support the
institutional frameworks (legislation, policies and strategies) and structures established during
the previous Bank project (EMSAP1). In 2009, Federal Government prepared a second SPM
to guide implementation of all HIV/AIDS activities up to 2011. The National AIDS Council
(chaired by the President), FHAPCO Management Board (chaired by the Minister of Health)
and Review Board met regularly and discharged their responsibilities fully. Regional AIDS
Councils (chaired by the regional presidents), Management Boards (chaired by the heads of
the Regional Health Boards) and Review Boards also met regularly. Governments at all levels
supported project implementation, provided timely approval of HAPCO Annual Action Plans,
and collaborated and cooperated fully with the project team.

68.    There were however, two major areas of concern: (i) the BPR exercise, a management
change process across the civil service, was delayed by over a year; this resulted in high staff


                                                    16
turnover and sub-optimal HAPCO performance during the period of change; (ii) there were
recurrent long delays in delivery of satisfactory audit reports, IFRs and SoEs; this was
recognized as a cross-government problem and was not addressed until the time of the Mid-
Term Review. The project was formally flagged as a problem project in mid 2008, but the
situation improved greatly over the following year.

69.    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

(b) Implementing Agency Performance

70.     FHAPCO, as implementing agency, effectively managed planning, approval, and
review processes, and ensured effective coordination between the different sectors and
implementation levels. However, financial and procurement management was a major concern,
particularly during the first two years of implementation. This partly resulted from the lengthy
restructuring of the agency as part of the BPR (discussed above), which contributed in part to
high staff turnover (though it must be questioned whether more effective FHAPCO
management could have mitigated this). There was insufficient FHAPCO capacity to manage
a large influx of funding from other sources (notably PEPFAR and the Global Fund). Lower
priority was given to EMSAP2 activities, and implementation was slow during the first two
years of the project.

71.     Performance improved considerably once the agency had completed the BPR process
and finalized its internal structuring and staffing. All collaborative projects were managed by a
unified directorate, ensuring appropriate levels of prioritization and oversight. FHAPCO also
increased its technical staff (with some project support). Project funds were fully disbursed by
the closing date.

72.    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

73.   In the light of the Moderately Satisfactory Government performance and FHAPCO’s
Moderately Satisfactory performance as implementing agency, the overall performance of the
Borrower is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

74.     Maintaining strong national and lower level coordination entities is a critical
component of an effective and sustained response: The establishment and strengthening of
HAPCOs at the federal, regional and woreda levels was a major undertaking that has proven
effective. The time, staffing and other resources allotted for the continued strengthening of
the system are important in project implementation. The project supported effective
coordination of an impressively wide range of public sector agencies.

75.    Ensuring harmonization of development partner inputs requires agreement to adopt
shared processes and systems, and move beyond “consensus rhetoric?: eventual agreement


                                                  17
to use a single M&E framework, and impressive moves towards joint review, planning and
budgeting, helped to reduce the administrative burden on the country, and mitigate the
serious capacity constraints.

76.    Management capacity should be proportionate to levels of funding and program
expectations: Particular care is needed to ensure that the levels of capacity are sufficient to
manage large influxes of donor funding; in the absence of this, smaller projects are likely to
receive insufficient attention.

77.    Availability of the country based TTL is critical for ongoing supervision of the project
and timely identification of bottlenecks and appropriate solutions.


78.     Relatively small amounts of funding can have a catalytic effect if designed and
delivered strategically: EMSAP2 was instrumental in re-directing national efforts towards
effective strategies (clearly defining and focusing on MARPs) and catalyzing community
involvement and responses.

79.     Development of a comprehensive M&E framework should be one of the first project
interventions: Such a framework needs to reflect the different M&E requirements and
approaches to capacity building of different partners, and to ensure timely integration of
different components of the system; in the case of EMSAP2, delays in establishment of the
CIS, and in integrating the HMIS and HIV/AIDS systems, led to lack of timely information to
report on program performance. The project design underestimated the level of inputs and
time which would be needed to have an effectively functioning and fully integrated system.

80.     A Heterogeneous and diversified epidemic requires detailed and regularly updated
information to guide interventions: The Epidemiological Synthesis study, carried out with
Bank support in 2008, was an important contribution to national program development and
updating, and confirmed the importance of focusing on prevention and targeting the most-at-
risk population and hot spot areas, but continued follow up was (and still is) required for a
fully effective response. A later survey15 identifying Institutes of higher learning as
emerging ―hot spots‖ for HIV transmission and identified university students as a previously
unrecognized group at risk of acquiring HIV infection.

81.      Successful HIV/AIDS prevention programs need to respond to a full analysis of the
epidemiological situation, including an honest assessment of those populations most likely to
contribute to new infections: In the case of Ethiopia there was good reason to be concerned
at the increased infection risks faced by MSM, and the possibility that new infections in this
group were an important driver of the epidemic, but there was widespread reluctance to
address this. A formal Political Economy Analysis could have informed a strategy to
overcome this reluctance.

   1. According to the signed financial agreement, the initial project fund of EMSAP-II was
   SDR 20 million (US$ 30 million). This was reduced to USD 25 million after USD 5 million
   had been moved to the Country’s Food Security Response. However due to gains from
   exchange rate changes, the total amount of fund utilized was US$25,997,472.12. This is 104%

                             Annex 2. Outputs by Component


Component 1: National Program Coordination and Institutional Strengthening
1.      The project provided financial, material and technical inputs to strengthen governance
and coordination mechanisms at all levels. High level coordination outputs included regular
meetings of the National AIDS Council, (chaired by the President), FHAPCO Management
Board (chaired by the Minister of Health) and Program Review Board, and regular meetings
of the equivalent bodies at regional level (Regional AIDS Councils, chaired by the regional
president; HAPCO Management Board meetings, chaired by Regional Health Board Heads;
and regional Program Review Boards).

2.     A notable output was the holding of quarterly Joint Review meetings at all levels.
These involved a wide range of stakeholders and development partners and were an effective
mechanism for coordination and monitoring of program performance.

3.     Capacity building of government agencies and civil society was strengthened through
support to recruitment of key officials and staff in all parts of the system. Examples include:
   - recruitment of regional finance officers (29), woreda focal persons (415) and regional
       auditors (18), who filled critical Human Resource gaps.
   - financial management staff in all regions benefitted from the special training programs
       on the Bank`s financial management systems, organized by HAPCO.
   - procurement management staff received two rounds of training in Ghana.
   - the national M&E system was expanded and strengthened, and is now used by
       implementing partners; this included design and implementation of the Community
       Information system, designed to capture key non-health performance results.
   - ―Training of Trainers‖ training on program management provided to government staff
       from a wide range of different sectors; and on guidelines for provision of care and
       support to Orphans and Vulnerable Children (provided to 66 staff).
   - Two days training on HIV and AIDS to members of the House of Representatives.
   - Drafting and distribution of policy and program manuals and guidelines (eg 15,000
       HIV Testing and Counseling manuals).

4.      At the time of project closure the M&E system was producing regular reports using
developed formats on a quarterly, biannual and annual basis. Monitoring and supportive
supervision missions were conducted by FHAPCO directorates on a quarterly basis, to provide
significant strengthening of the national response.

5.     Special note should be made of the epidemiological synthesis study carried out in
2007. This had a significant impact upon policy, acting to refocus attention on the importance
of addressing Most At-Risk Populations. (HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia: An Epidemiological
Synthesis; Ethiopia HIV/AIDS Prevention & Control Office and Global HIV/AIDS
Monitoring and Evaluation Team (GAMET), The Global HIV/AIDS Program, World Bank,
April 2008).

 Component 2: Multi-Sectoral Prevention Fund

 6.       This component supported a broad range of prevention interventions in the public
 sector, particularly targeting the most high-risk and vulnerable populations. At federal level
 17 government public offices designed and implemented intervention programs targeting their
 staff in the workplace, and their client groups. In addition, eleven regional government
 bureaus and offices accessed the Multi-Sectoral Prevention Fund. Table 6 summarizes the
 main outputs produced by these different agencies.

Component 3: Local Response Fund

11.      The Local Response Fund was established as Component 3 to support community and
woreda-based initiatives delivering evidence-based HIV prevention and mitigation activities
targeting specific key at-risk groups. The focus of activities was at kebele (local council)
level, including: ―Community Conversations‖ (meetings of up to 50 participants to discuss
HIV and AIDS related topics); dialogue with young people; support to PLHIV and OVC;
condom promotion and distribution; and uptake of counseling and testing. Some Kebeles
installed condom dispensing boxes providing easy access to condoms.

12.     These activities contributed to important Outputs, most notably: the huge increase in
VCT uptake (voluntary HIV testing before marriage became the norm in much of the
country); a significant reduction in stigma and discrimination (as noted by those directly
affected); and support to marginalized groups such as prisoners, housemaids, the elderly and
the disabled.

13.       Specific Outputs included:
      -   Food support to over 230,000 OVCs and shelter to 23,000 (community members in
          some rural areas established grain banks at kebele level to support orphans; others
          contributed cash)
      -   IGA training to 43,000 OVCs, with business startup funds provided to 37,000 children
          and their guardians
      -   Educational support provided to over 350,000 OVCs.
      -   Number of Kebeles conducting community conversations 17,575
      -   Schools implementing Community conversation 15,305

     Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis (including assumptions in the analysis)

1.       This annex presents estimates of economic analysis done for the project. The analysis
focuses on the economic benefits on the following categories of community-based preventive
activities supported through the project: (a) behavior change interventions at community level;
(b) counseling and testing; and (c) condom distribution. These activities are part of
Component 2 of the project which focuses on preventive activities, with strong emphasis on
community-based intervention delivery channels. The total expenditure under this component
was $3.5 million. The analysis below provides estimates of the total economic benefits of
these three categories of activities financed by the project.

2.       It is worth noting that this analysis does not take into account the economic impact of
activities aimed at strengthening the capacity among agencies working on HIV/AIDS in the
country, which were carried out under Component 1 (The National Program Coordination and
Institutional Strengthening), a key component of the project. As noted in the PAD, the World
Bank was seen as donor of last resort in the context of EMSAP 2, ―filling the gaps and
funding shortfalls that are not being addressed by other donors.‖ This is a critical function to
increase the efficiency of the national response and promote resilience to sudden changes in
donor funding priorities, by allowing more flexibility to focus on medium to long term
planning capabilities. This set of activities was not taken into under this valuation exercise in
light of the major difficulties to estimate the amount of economic benefits that they generate.
As a result the estimates of economic impact reported here represent a conservative, lower-
bound estimate of the actual benefits provided by the project activities.

3. The analysis presented in this annex extends and updates the economic analysis that was
conducted during the project appraisal process. The estimation of the economic impact of the
project under this approach is a combination of two main measures: (a) a valuation of the loss
in years of the victims’ productive life and (b) the increase in treatment costs due to
HIV/AIDS. The first measure takes into account that, without access to life-saving ARV
treatment, HIV patients tend to becomes less productive over time and die at an earlier age
than they otherwise would in the absence of disease. The second measure recognizes that HIV
patients often incur excess health care associated with the treatment of symptoms and
opportunistic infections. These need to be valued at market reference rates to reflect the
opportunity cost of providing treatment to the disease at the expense of other health priorities.
In addition, as noted in the PAD, ―ART itself can incur benefits by extending the number of
productive years of HIV/AIDS victims.‖ An objective measure will therefore need to focus
on incorporating the positive benefits of ART in the calculation of the net benefit of
intervention.

4.      Additional measures of impact, such as through reduction in capital stock and

                                                  25
 accumulated GDP per capita as well as wider macroeconomic impact, although plausible, are
 not taken into consideration explicitly in this analysis. Again, the main reasons are (a) the
 lack of necessary information to allow a coherent and consistent estimation; and (b)
 preference to provide a conservative estimate of the lower bound estimate.

Results of the analysis

5.       The results are driven mainly by the size of the target population and the project
effectiveness in increasing the key outcome indicator, namely the rate of condom use per
sexual episode including both the general population and the sex workers groups targeted by
interventions. Evidence from the ICR suggests the project was highly successful in increasing
the rate of condom use in the general population, with a 76% increase observed between the
baseline and project completion.

6.      The increase in condom use and consequent reduction in unprotected sex in the general
population was key to the project success and the main source of the estimated economic
benefits derived from the project implementation.

7.    As seen in Table 2, there is a sizeable estimate of the economic benefit of Component
2. The benefit/cost ratio is estimated between 1.99 (low case for sex worker population size
estimate) and 2.43 (high case for sex worker population size estimate).

HIV/AIDS PREVENTION & CONTROL OFFICE (HAPCO)

Background

1.      In response to HIV/AIDS pandemic the government of FDRE and partners are
implementing various projects and programs for more than a decade. One of such partners is
World Bank. World Bank was pioneer to initiate multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS prevention and
control Project in the Ethiopia. The first project supported by the Bank was MAP-I or
EMSAP-I. The total amount of fund allocated for this project was US$ 61.7 Million. The
Project became effective in 2001 and closed in December 2006.

2.      Based on lessons learned from implementation of EMSAP-I and other donor activities,
as well as on evidences from other countries the importance of implementing interventions
focusing most-at risk groups (MARPs) and in ―hotspots‖ became evident. Cognizant of this
fact World Bank continued to support HIV/AIDS prevention and control response of the
country by developing EMSAP-II project. The Bank continued its support with the following
rationales.
 At the time of the initiation of EMSAP2 the epidemic was progressing at a slower rate, but
    it will take number of years to see noticeable declines in both prevalence and incidence.
 To reduce the incidence as well as prevalence it needs consorted effort of all actors.
 If the potential impacts of the epidemic are not controlled, it would have devastating
    effects on economic growth, social wellbeing, life expectancy etc.
 Government and its many partners acknowledge the need to maintain the gains and further
    scale-up interventions through well-coordinated planning and better program
    implementation.

3.     When World Bank decided to continue supporting the project, it ensured that the
country complies with the following Bank Multi- country AIDS Program (MAP) repeater
requirements:
 The existence of one national HIV/AIDS strategy and one national HIV/AIDS authority.
 The consolidation of a comprehensive national monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system
   for HIV/AIDS.
 Willingness to use simplified implementation procedures to facilitate a satisfactory
   disbursement pace.
 Willingness to integrate performance considerations into fund allocation and disbursement
   decisions.

4.    EMSAP-II was signed on March 30, 2007 between IDA and Ministry of Finance and
Economic Development of FDRE. It became effective in July 2007 and it was closed on
September 30/2011. The main objectives of the project were:
    To Increase access to prevention services for youth, in particular females aged 15-24,
      and other most-at-risk groups; and
    To sustain access to care and support for PLHIV and orphans undertaken in EMSAP-I.


                                                31
5.       To complement increasing prevention services for these vulnerable and at risk groups,
the project designed to support community-based interventions focused on changing behavior,
such as partner reduction, fight against Female Genital Mutilation, increased condom
utilization, and decrease in gender-based violence. The project also focused on rural and peri-
urban areas where the majority of the population lives and on specific ―hotspots‖ such as
market towns, secondary towns, and transportation hubs.

6.     EMSAP-II had the following three components.

Component 1: National Program Coordination and Institutional Strengthening: The
objective of this component was to further improve the coordination and delivery of the
national HIV/AIDS strategy and action plan at all levels. Project support in this area was in
line with the national capacity building program of the Government and addresses key areas
of capacity gaps in the implementation of the national HIV/AIDS strategy. In addition, it
strengthened the monitoring and evaluation system at all levels, supported specific
operations research and other impact evaluation and assessment activities

Component 2: Multi-Sectoral Prevention Fund: This component was aimed at supporting a
broad range of interventions in the public sector to prevent the spread of HIV. The main
activities supported included behavioral change targeted activities, peer education, HCT,
condom distribution, and mechanisms for reduction of harmful traditional practices. The
support e targeted the most important high-risk and vulnerable population. Financial support
was provided through a competitive process based on submission of proposals by the
respective ministries and agencies.

Component 3: Local Response Fund: This component supported community and woreda-
based initiatives focused on primarily HIV prevention and mitigation activities targeting
specific key at-risk groups. The types of activities financed under this component included
HIV/AIDS awareness creation at community level; behavioral change (reduction of traditional
harmful practices; safer sexual behavior by both SWs and their clients; delayed first sexual
intercourse; reduction in early marriage; reduced sex with non-regular partners); condom
distribution; and counseling and testing services.

7.      According to the signed project agreement, the initial project fund of EMSAP-II was
SDR 20 million (US$ 30 million). This was reduced to 25 million US$ after 5 million US$
had been moved to the Country’s Food Security Response. However due to gains from
exchange rate, the total amount of fund utilized was 25,997,472.12 US$. This is 104% from
the signed amount and almost 100% of the project fund. This suggests that there was good
performance in implementing project activities and utilizing allocated project fund.

8.      The project was implemented in 417 (52% of the total) woredas drawn from 9 regional
states and 2 city administrations. The project reached about 8000 kebeles from the selected
project woredas. Besides at federal level the project was implemented by 17government
offices and 7 Civil Society organizations.

Project Implementation and achievement status of each component
A. Component-I: Capacity Building and Coordination

9.      Component-I fund was allocated for capacity building and enhancing coordination The
objective was to improve the capacity of implementers at all level by supporting the
establishment of and strengthening relevant structure and deploying able human resources.

10.     The total amount of fund utilized for financing this component was Birr 74,689,085,
and mainly covered the cost of goods, trainings and consultancy and operating cost including
salary for staff.

11.        This facilitated implementation process of the project. Other major activities included
         training to regions on financial management focusing on settlement of advances by
          disbursement based on the Bank modification of financial management . Support was
          alo provided for two rounds training on procurement management in Ghana.
         Joint Review meetings were conducted quarterly in harmonized manner
         AIDS council, management board and review board were functional having regular
          meetings according to their schedules.
         The M&E system has been established and became operational. Accordingly
          implementers were submitting their reports using developed formats on quarterly,
          biannually and annually basis. Supportive supervisions were conducted by FHAPCOs
          different directorates on quarterly basis.
         All regions hired finance officers and auditors with the support from the project. Few
          regions employed additional program and M&E officers by the project at regional and
          zonal levels.
         In all regions the necessary institutional arrangements that have been established. (
          like Regional AIDS councils, management boards and review boards ) were supported
          and strengthened.

B. Component 2: Multi-Sectoral Prevention Fund

12.     This component was aimed at supporting a broad range of interventions in the public
sector. The main supported activities included behavioral change targeted activities, peer
education, HCT, condom distribution, and mechanisms for reduction of harmful traditional
practices. The support targeted the most important high-risk and vulnerable groups. The
amount of fund utilized for this component was Birr 57,178,527. At federal level 17
government public offices after submitting their proposals and won the competitive process
accessed fund from this component. They assigned focal persons and conducted trainings on
mainstreaming and other HIV/AIDS related issues. Few conducted researches to find out the
impact of HIV/AIDS in their organizations. interventions targeting MARPs. The major sector
offices include Ministry of Federal Affairs, National Lottery Administration, Ethiopian
Mapping Agency, Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, Ministry of Water
Resources, Environmental Protection Agency, National Archives & Library Agency,
Transport Authority, Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation, Rural Energy Development&
Promotion Center, Ministry of Youth and Sports and Ethiopian Road Authority Ministry of

13.      Almost in all regions major MARPs focused government sectors were given due
attention.
The sector offices were selected through the review process since their proposals address
behavioral change targeted activities, peer education, counseling and testing, condom
promotion and distribution and other related activities which focus on vulnerable groups and
most at risk populations.

14.     The most important partners were bureaus of education, bureaus of women, youth and
children affairs and bureaus of youth affairs implemented strategic preventive interventions.
.
15.     The component fund was used to strengthen mainstreaming of HIV/AIDS prevention
and programs in key public sector offices. It helped to establish AIDS fund through allocation
of 2% from recurrent budget, assigning of focal persons and preparation and execution of
sector specific HIV/AIDS annual plans.

16.    Activities implemented in schools strengthened HIV/AIDS prevention responses
among the in- school youth. Youth centers were established and equipped with the project
fund.IGA intervention implemented by some bureaus has helped to economically empower
poor women and older orphans.

C. Component 3: Local Response Fund

17.      This component mainly supported community and woreda as well as kebele based
initiatives focused on primarily HIV prevention and impact mitigation activities targeting
specific key at-risk population group. Civil society organizations (CSOs), NGOs and FBOs
were also supported by this component. The total amount of fund utilized for this component
was Birr 189, 920,139. At federal level 7 CSOs, FBOs and NGOs were supported.

18.    Major activities carried out at kebele level included community conversation, , youth
dialogue, support to PLWHIV and OVC, condom promotion and distributions.

19.    In each kebele there was at least one CC site while in some they had up to 4 CC sites.
In each site 50 participants conducted community conversations twice per month on various
HIV/AIDS related issues. Condoms procured by the component fund were also distributed at
woreda and kebele levels.

20.    Some of the major challenges encountered are inadequate and irregular fund
disbursement; high turnover of staff; limited opportunity of capacity building trainings,
marginal involvement of zones and occasional changes in woreda boundaries

21.     In conclusion, based on the project targets indicators, all set targets have been achieved
and this was confirmed by the last supportive supervision mission of the World Bank. The
project has significantly contributed for the overall national response . Even though the


                                                   34
project fund compared with others was small, the results are far reaching and instrumental.
The project was catalyst in effectively implementing others programs and strengthening
community response.
.
22.     It is recommended to
     Exert all efforts to maintain and strengthen the already established institutional
         arrangements at all level.
     Give due attention to public sectors. to strengthen mainstreaming and establish fund
         raising mechanisms
     foster community response.

Annex 7. Methodology, Results, and Conclusions of the Special KAP Survey Commissioned
                               by HAPCO on HIV/AIDS.

    A. Background

1.      Due to unanticipated delays in conducting a demographic and health survey (DHS),
FHAPCO commissioned a special survey on ―The Status of Sexual Behavior, Knowledge about
HIV/AIDS and Condom Utilization In Thirty-Five Woredas.‖ This knowledge, attitudes and
practices (KAP) survey was intended to obtain information on three outcome indicators of
EMSAP-II project. FHAPCO commissioned a consulting firm, Babu General Trading PLC, to
conduct this KAP survey.

2.       The general purpose of this survey was to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of
the target groups regarding HIV and AIDS. Specifically, the survey was to 1) assess the
comprehensive knowledge of the target groups on HIV and AIDS; 2) ascertain the target groups’
knowledge on HIV prevention methods and HIV transmission modes; 3) appraise the prevailing
misconceptions of the target group about HIV and AIDS; and 4) estimating the level of condom
utilization among the target groups.

    B. Methodology

Primary data collection through structured surveys

Survey coverage

 3.     The assessment survey was designed and conducted to maximize its representativeness in terms
 of both respondents and variables. Maximum effort has been exerted to make its coverage and scope as
 much technically inclusive as was possible. Being so, it covered all the areas enumerated by the client.

4.       In determining the coverage and scope of the KAP survey, the geographic, demographic and
sectoral diversities of the regions were the primary considerations. The survey covered localities that are
within urban and pastoralist settings. Taking the lifespan of localities as a factor, it equally embraced sites
that are relatively old and new given the presumed difference in levels of urbanization that derive from
the length of period in which the locality has been settled.

5.     Considering all these factors, 35 woredas were selected from nine regions and two city
administrations of FDRE.

Sampling frame and designs

 6.     The target groups of the survey were youth in the age group of 15 – 24 years, including both in-
 school and out-of school youth. Since there are two types of target groups, in- and out-of school youth
 sub-groups, two sampling frames were used. The school roaster constituted the sampling universe for the
 in-school youth while the list of the localities in the KAs was the source from which the out-of-school
 youth were drawn after a mapping exercise which identified congregation sites and times.

7.     In designing the sample for the determination of the sample size for the two sub-groups, the
prime consideration has been the factor of access to information services on reproductive health. Equally



                                                        38
important has been the assumption that each segment has a significant diversity within it deriving from
socio-economic status.
8.      A two-stage sampling procedure was employed. While the first procedure involves the
determination of enumeration areas or KAs, the second stage was the selection of the ultimate individual
respondents using standard probability sampling.

Sample Size:
9.      In consultation with the client, a total of 1,225 sample size was set. This total sample size was
equally distributed among the thirty-five Woredas. The survey group was also equally divided between
male and female respondents with the latter category subsuming FSWs.

Survey Instruments
10.      Appropriate instruments for the collection of data from various sources were developed. Two
types of formats were used. The first is the data collection format, which had been used during the
interaction with the target audience at the field level in the participatory approach. The second is semi-
structured format. This format was used as a checklist to guide the qualitative appraisal in the conduct of
FGDs and panel interviews.

11.     The survey instrument included the variables most relevant to revealing the status of KAP
towards HIV and AIDS as well as the evaluation of past performance. There have been other instruments
geared towards capturing the available (local) response capabilities to HIV/AIDS. These (local) response
capabilities in terms of prevention include the establishment of anti-AIDS clubs, the proliferation of
associations of PLWAs, Community Conversation (CC) increasing and sustaining care and support
services as well as the institutionalization of monitoring and evaluation systems.

Participatory Appraisal through non-structured survey
12.     The participatory approach helped to generate such important information that could not be easily
captured through the structured survey and also provided greater flexibility to the experts to investigate
new conditions that may not have been anticipated in the planning of the study and designing the
instruments.

13.     FGDs were undertaken with different segments of the target youth groups in order to have a fair
representation of the various cross-sections of the age cohort. The consulting team held one FGD in each
woreda selected for the structured survey. On average, about ten youth participated in these FGDs.
Supervisors purposively selected the participants with sensitivity to gender and social station.

Secondary data collection from stakeholders
14.     These quantitative and qualitative sources of data were further enriched by the information
provided by active stakeholders working in the front lines, including local HAPCO, the anti-AIDS clubs
in schools, the local chapters of the national and regional associations of PLWAs as well as front line peer
educators. They provided crucial information about the factors that influence the sexual behavior of the
local youth, the possible sources of misconception, and the degree of acceptance of HIV/AIDS not only as
a healthcare issue but more importantly as a socio-economic phenomenon as well as the available care
and support services within the local context. Equally important has been the information provided by
these stakeholders regarding the nature and effectiveness of the intervention currently underway their
respective localities.

Data Validation
15. The consulting team reviewed the data collected from the different sources to verify their validity at
the field level. This helped track data inconsistencies and allow timely corrections.

16.     The 3 tables above provide some of the key findings of the survey. The first table
suggests that knowledge about prevention of HIV and rejection of common misconceptions is
widespread and that there is little difference between men and women and between the regions.
The second table suggests that among the sexually active population the use of condoms is
widespread and with little regional variation except for Afar. The last table provides data on the
practices of more than 500 commercial sex workers and indicates that condom use is widespread
and consistent.

   D. Conclusions

17.     The methodology used for the rapid KAP survey commissioned by HAPCO was in keeping with
standard practices and the sampling appeared to be reasonably done. The results about knowledge appear
somewhat higher than the preliminary data from the 2011 DHS (see para. 38 in the main text) but do not
seem wildly out of keeping with the broader national findings. There is room for legitimate skepticism
about the results about condom use among sex workers which was also reported to be very high at
baseline. Findings such as these are improbably high and likely reflect that CSWs know the right answer
and provide it to surveyors.
