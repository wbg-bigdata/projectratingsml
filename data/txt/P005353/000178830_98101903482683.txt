APPRAISAL OF ANI EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROJECT
IN MOROCCO
*                                             SUM!{ARY
i.        The International Development Association was asked by the
*~ -Moroccan Government to help finance the construction and equipment of 21 multi-
lateral secondary schools. With the request were submitted estimates of
cost, a standard sketch plan for the proposed schools and informiation about
the Moroccan education system and school enrolment. The total estimated cost
of the proposed project is about DH 80.7 million, equivalent to US$16.20
million. The proposed IDA development credit of $11 million, or about two-
thirds of the estimated total cost, will cover all the foreign exchange
component, estimated at about 30 percent of the total cost of the project,
and part of the local currency.  The project, expected to be completed by 1968,
will permit about 30,000 additional students to be enrolled in secondary
education. This is about 30 percent of the total increase in secondary
school enrolment envisaged in the Three-Year Plan.
ii.       An education appraisal mission visited Morocco in March/April, 1965,
and held meetings with the Ministry of Education and other Ministries connected
with the project and the training of technicians. The mission visited schools
in various parts of the country and most of the towns where the 21 schools
of the project will be constructed.
iii.      Following independence in 1956 the Moroccan Government embarked on
a policy of expanding primary education but expansion of secondary school
enrolment did not start until 1960/61 and is still inadequate. In the public
and private sectors there is a distinct shortage of trained manpower at this
level. Furthermore, applicants for entry into the university are still small
in number so that the field of selection continues to be narrow, Lastly,
highly paid expatriates still hold a high percentage of middle and high-level
jobs. Government policy is to gradually replace expatriates by Moroccans and
this requires a rapid expansion of secondary education as the main key to the
problem. The proposed project is directed to assist in meeting the
aforementioned needs.
iv.       Of the 30,000 students who will be enrolled in the 21 schools of the
proposed project, 24,000 will be boys and 5,700 will be girls. Boarding
accommodation is included for 3,400 boarders of whom a little over 900 will be
girls. By 1968/69 when the project is fully implemented, the 2L schools
will have about 12,200 in the common first two years of study (observation
classes), 6,650 students in the "short" course and a total of 10,800 in the
two cycles of the "long" course.  In the "short" course 1,260 students will
pursue training in agriculture, 635 in canmerce, 538 in industrial training, anc
112 in feminine arts together with 4,100 in general studies. In the second cycle
of the long caurse, about 1920 students will be specializing in sciences,458 in



- ii -
mathematics, 332 in industrial arts and 128 in commerce. To these should be
added about 3,800 students who will specialize in languages, history and
other general subjects.  Mlany of the second cycle students will proceed to
universities.
v.        The estimated cost of the proposed project is made up of $2.4
million for sites, $1.1 million for site development works and $7.1 million
for construction. Furniture, domestic appliances, science laboratories and
workshop equiprment and libraries take about $3.2 million while professional
fees and contingencies account for about $2.4 million. The estimates and
unit costs are reasonable.
vi.       Additional teachers required to staff the 21 schools form part of
the total number of teachers required for the expansion of secondlary education
envisaged in the Three-Year Plan.  The supply of trained teachers will fall
short of the need and emergency measures will have to be adopted- such as the
employment of senior primary school teachers-to staff the first two years of
common study - until 1969/70 when the Advanced Teacher Training College out-
put is able to meet the teacher need at this level.
vii.      The estimated annual cost of operating these schools after full
implementation of the project will be approximately DH 25 million which is
within the financial resources of the country.
viii.     Architects, engineers and contractors are available in Morocco.
But for the proper administration and supervision of the imJlementation of
the Dror'sed project the Mloroccan government has agreed to estabLish in the Min4
stry of Education a special Project Unit consisting of a cempetent architect,
an educator with experience in school construction and an accountant together
with technical and clerical supporting staff.
ix.       The project constitutes an important part of the education develop-
ment plan of Morocco. It is considered to be justifiable and of high priority.
It therefore presents a suitable basis for an IDA development credit of S11
million.



APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROJECT
IN MOROCCO
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        In November 1964, IDA received a request from the Moroccan
government for financial assistance in the construction and equipment of 21
schools offering general and specialized education and training at the
secondary level. The appraisal mission appointed by IDA visited Morocco from
24th Mlarch to 29th April, 1965. The mission consisted of Messrs. Ahmad Tuqan
(mission chief), J.C.Jones (Ministry of Overseas Development, U.K.),
P.H. Oltmanns and F. Lethem.
2.        Previous missions to Morocco included a Unesco Educational Investment,
Programming Mission (1963) and a Bank Economic Survey Mission (1964):  the
relevant sections of their reports were available to the members of the
appraisal mission.  In Paris, the mission had discussions with Unesco, the
French Bureau of Technical Assistance, the French Ministry of Education and
O.E.C .D.
Social and Economic Background
3.        Morocco, formerly French and Spanish protectorates, achieved
independence in 1956. The census of 1960 showed a total population of 11.63
million of whom some 70% lived in rural areas: the present population is
estimated at 13.43 million, the great majority of whom are Moslems.
4.        The total area of the country, 520,000 sq. kms., comprises good
agricultural land either irrigated or rain fed, extensive forests, and sparsely
populated desert. Agriculture is the main source of employment but there are
large mineral resources with phosphate as the principal export, and projects
for the creation of a chemical and fertiliser industry are nearing completion.
The long seaboard on both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean supports a major
fishing industry and adds to the many other attractions for a developing
tourist trade. Potentially Morocco is among the richest of the Arab countries.
5.        The strong cultural and economic ties developed with France during the
period of the Protectorate (1913-1956) continue, with French reraaining the
official second language and gradually replacing Spanish from its similar
position in the fomrer Spanish-protected territories in the North. The edu-
cational system closely follows that of France and derives much assistance
under the terms of a cultural convention with that country.
6.        The economic and social position of Moroccan women is changing. The
numbers entering schools and their length of school life are increasing,
though relatively few as yet reach the higher levels;  employment opportunities
are extending beyond the traditional work of the home and the field to
goverment service and private enterprise.

II. EDUCATION AND TRADING
7.        The system of education has reached a transitional point at which
the former Koranic schools have been largely replaced, at least in the tolms,
by the French patterm of education which, in its turn, is being modified to
meet Moroccan needs. Arabic is replacing French as the medium of instruction
in primary schools but French continues to be used in secondary education.
8.        Basically the existing pattern, as showfn in Annex I, consists
of a primary stage of five years' duration followed by a selective secondary
stage having two main divisions, "long course" and "short course".  Tncluded
in each course is an observational year in which aptitudes can be noted and
guidance as to future studies given. As from 1965/66, the common course
is to extend over two years.
9.        The long course is divided into first and second cycles, of four
years' (including the observational year) and three years' duration, respec-
tively. The first cycle offers a continued general education and leads to
the award of a certificate of secondary education (C.E.S.). Promotion to
the second cycle is based upon the results of orientation tests separately
administered by a department of the Ministry of Education. Successful
candidates are directed into one of two broad groups: the firstl leads to
the baccalaureat examination and thence to the university or equivalent
institution, and the second to a diploma examination and employment or
further training (generally abroad) at the technician level. The bacca-
laureat may be taken in Arabic studies, modern languages and literature,
mathematics, experimental science   or economics.  The diploma may relate
to industry, commerce, agriculture  or women's social activities.
10.       The short course is of four years' duration (including the observa-
tional year) and offers either a continued general education somewhat similar
to that of the long course or a number of alternatives which are vocationally-
biased. The former leads to the award of the certificate of secondary educa-
tion and the latter to a celtificate of technical education (C,E.T.) which
may be folloiied by employment in industry, commerce, agriculture or in women's
trades. In certain cases students who are successful in the short course may
continue for one or more years of specialized training, enter a teacher train-
ing college or pass to the appropriate long course. It is unlikely that
many will follow these alternative paths since those admitted to the short
course are generally from among the less able or over-age studenats.
Statistics
11.       The period since 1956 has been characterized by more than a three-
fold growth in educational enrolment at both primary and secondary levels
(Annex II) accompanied by an increase in total expenditure from DH 179 million
in 1956 to IH 474.7 million in 1964, i.e. from 13.2 percent to 16.2 percent
of the total national budget. An analysis of enrolments for the academic years
1961-1964 and the corresponding educational pyramids are shown in Annexes III
(A, B, and C) and IV (A, B, and C).



12.       The 1960 census shows that 16.64 percent of the total population
fell between the ages of 7 and 13, the normal range for primary school enrol-
ment. Applying this percentage to 1963/64 the total possible enrolment would
have been 2,101,600 as compared with an actual enrolment, including repeaters,
of 1,075,300 (51.2 percent of the age range) made up of 770,400 boys and
304,900 girls. Assuming an equal distribution of boys and girls in the age
group, these numbers represent 73.3 percent and 29.0 percent, reispectively,
of the possible totals.
13.       Total secondary enrolment (Annex II) showed little increase up to
1960 as compared with the doubling of primary enrolment. Heavy pressure on
secondary school enrolment then became apparent and Government therefore
quadrupled secondary enrolment during the next four years. The ratio of
secondary to primary enrolment (12.71 percent in 1963/64) is still low com-
pared with many developing countries (20 percent). Furthermore,, only 7 per-
cent of children of secondary school age were attending secondary schools in
1964. Further expansion is essential if the supply of candidates for univer-
sity entrance and for middle level posts in the Government and private sectors
of the economy is to be adequate.
14.       Further improvements in enrolment could be effected by a reductilon
in the "repeaters" rate which now stands at an accepted figure of 20 percent
in the primary school and at an actual figure of 11.5 percent in the secondary
school visited. Considerable economy could be effected if measures are intro-
duced to control the number of repeaters within reasonable limits. In many
countries, including some developing ones, automatic promotion eat the primary
level is the accepted rule. It is hoped that Morocco will soon appreciate the
need for taking similar steps. At the secondary level a reduction in the
number of repeaters could be effected by more selective admission procedures.
Curricula and Bnquipment
15.       Examples of secondary school curricula are given in Anmex V and show-
a requirement of from 29 to 32 hours per week of attendance for general educa-
tion courses, from 32 to 36 hours per week for commercial courses, and up to
40 hours per week for agricultural and industrial courses.
16.       The preponderant literary character of the first cycle long course
calls for comment; consideration should be given to the introduction of
physics, chemistry and educational handicrafts if modern educational thought
is to be followed. This could be effected either by increasing the curriculum
to about 32 hours per week or by a reduction of the present over-allocation to
languages, or by a combination of the two.
17.       Teaching of physics and chemistry presents little opportunity for
experimental work by the student. In part this results from inadequate provi-
sion for the purchase of laboratory materials but the importance of such work
is not always realized by the teacher and there is need for corrective action
through the media of training college and refresher courses.



- 4 -
18.       A further serious handicap to effective teaching arise's from the
general lack of low-priced text-books.  Suitable books, including French
texts modified to meet MAoroccan needs, are available and the Franklin Institutq
at the request of U.S. AID, is showing interest in the possibility of their
wider distribution.
19.       The workshops are usually located in detached buildings providing
for a number of related trades to be taught under one roof. Their equipment
is mostly adequate, in some cases generous, and the space provided permits of
good layout. Balanced training programmes leading to a progressive acquisi-
tion of the necessary skills are to be seen but are often impeded by the lack
of adequate supplies of working materials. To supplement the budget in this
respect it is frequently necessary to undertake production work which though
of advantage in some respects may not always fit easily into the teaching
program and usually demands a disproportionate amount of the instructors' time.
20.       Generally speaking, the training is broadly based or "polyvalent"
in the earlier years of the courses with some measure of specialization in
the final years. This program meets fully the needs of the technician group
taking the long industrial course but is less appropriate to the needs of the
short industrial group whose prospects of employment would be enhanced by
more specialized training such as is available for limited numbers in the
optional fourth year shown in Annex V - (4).
21.       The proposal to establish a common two-year general edlucation course
will further restrict the opportunities for specialized training.  It is there-
fore considered necessaty that the present optional fourth year with its specia-
ized character be made obligatory. An altermative and possibly better long-tern
solution would be the introduction of a national apprenticeship scheme in
which industry would provide specialized training to supplement the general
training of the school. If neither of these solutions is practicable the
present generalized training should be restricted to a diagnostic period of
from six to nine months permitting a proper selection to be made from among
the specializations to be taught during the remainder of the shortened course.
Teacher demand and supply
22.       As in most developing countries there are major problems of teacher
supply consequent upon expansion of the educational system. In the case of
Morocco the demand is heightened by the need to replace expatriate French
teachers of whom more than 6,000 still remain in service. The extent of the
increasing demand, excluding replacement, is shown by the followfing table
giving the budgetary provision for teachers over the past five years:

TOTALS            19,795    24,348    29,826   3A,978    38,408
23.    Some reduction in the demand for secondary teachers should be made by
increasing average teaching loads above the figure of 16 holurs per week for
teachers holding university degrees. This was established originally for
French expatriate teachers. Class sizes however are about the correct
level (35-h0 students for general courses and 25-27 students for technical
courses) and should not be increased. The average number of students per
class in the secondary schools visited, which comprised 712 claLsses, was
38.4 for "observation" classes, 33.8 for general and 26.8 for technical
education.
24.    At the primary level the nunber of regional teacher training centers
has been increased from 6 in 1956 to 22 in 1964, and training sections
have been added to 6 of the larger secondary schools. In addition, bursaries
are awarded to secondary school pupils who undertake to enter primary
teacher training centers upon completion of the first secondary cycle.  In
1962/63 there were 2,470 students in teacher training and 6,500 secondary
school pupils in receipt of bursaries.  Parallel with the above developments,
steps are being taken to improve the qualifications of existing, teachers by
means of short refresher courses, both oral and by correspondence.  There is
no problem in meeting the demand for trained primary teachers, because the
number of graduates from primary teacher training schools will continue to
match thle requirement.
25.    The training of secondary school teachers is undertaken in the
Advanced Teacher Training College at Rabat with branches at Tetouan, Fes, and
Casablanca. Tuition is free and a stipend or bursary is awarded to those in
training. Students entering with the baccalaureat, or its equivalent, take
courses of two or three years' duration leading to qualification as first or
secornd cycle teachers, respectively. The Three-Year Plan provides for an
increase in enrolment of about 800, 1000, 1100 trainees in both courses in
the years 1965/66, 1966/67 and 1967/68, respectively. Total enrolment and
output are expected to be as follows:

It should, however, be remembered that the output in the above table does not
include university graduates who take up teaching as a profession.  Their
number cannot be estimated.
26.       The annual estimated enrolment in secondary classes according to
the Three-Year Plan is given in Annex VI, from which the teacher need may be
calculated by using the same criteria given in the Plan. I/ It should,
however, be noted that the planned expansion is not likely to be implemented
at the beginning of the academic year 1965/66 because the required school
buildings would not then be ready to receive the additional number of
students. A more realistic date would be the academic year 1966/67. The
estimated number of additional teachers for expansion, for a realistic
replacement of exDatriates and for filling possible vacancies created by
retircment and withdrawal,is given in the following table:
Table No.3 Estimated Secondary Teacher need.

27.       Comparison of the output of trained teachers given in table No.2
with the estimated need in table No.3 shows that (a) the need for 1L55
teachers in 1966/67 is greater than the accumulated output (825 teachers)
of the Advanced Teacher Training College for the years 1964/65 and 1965/66
by 630 teachers, (b) the College output in 1967/68 (875 teachers) will fall
short of the need (1745 teachers) for that year by 870 teachers, (c) for
the year 1968/69 the output (1310 teachers) will fall short of the need

(1650) by 340 and (d) for the succeeding years the output will be in excess of
the need. Only little dropout is expected because all the trainees are bursary
students bound by contracts to serve a specified number of years in teaching.
The shortage, which, during the first three years will total about 1,840
teachers, will have to be met by the temporary appointment of senior primary
teachers as an emergency measure. From 1969/70 onward the output from the
Advanced Teacher Training College is expected to replace the underqualified
teachers appointed during the emergency years.
28.       An important element in teacher supply is the relative! attractiveness
of the salaries offered. In Morocco teachers' salaries are below those avail-
able in industry and commerce for men of similar qualifications. The Moroccan
teacher is at further disadvantage in that the French expatriate teacher enjoys
a considerably higher salary for similar work. In 1964 the number of French
expatriates was more than 6,000, of whom some two-thirds had primary qualifica-
tions only, although engaged in secondary teaching. In meeting gratuities
upon enrolment and discharge and paying 89 percent of the salaries the Moroccan
Government is carrying a heavy financial burden.
Departmental Training
29.       A number of government and semi-government departments provide train-
ing schemes intended mainly to meet their own specialized needs. Thus the
Ministry of Public Works has established a full-time school for the training
of senior workshop staff and draughtsmen and has under consideration a second
school for the training of engineering assistants. Part-time courses for the
training of assistant draughtsmen and workshop supervisors, typists, book-
keepers, and clerks have been similarly established in regional centers.
30.       The mining industry, which is largely under government control,levies
a special tax on both public and private sectors equal to 0.5 percent of
salaries and wages for the provision of scholarships abroad for the higher
levels of training and local upgrading courses at the lower levels.
31.       Responsibility for agricultural education is shared between the
Ministries of Education and of Agriculture.  At the primary level special
rural programs involving gardening and small-scale animal husbandry have been
introduced into some 40 schools and the number is to be extended. At the first
cycle secondary level, nine schools provide courses leading to a certificate of
technical education in agriculture with the possibility of transfer for the
final year to departmental training in the direction of irrigation and rural
modernization. Those completing the first cycle may enter second cycle courses
at Kenitra to qualify as technicians or to proceed to higher courses as agri-
cultural engineers at iMeknes. Alternatively, second level specialized courses
are offered by the Ministry of Agriculture in six regional centers.
32.       Responsibility for the training of the skilled operative, as cortrasted
*           with higher levels of industrial training, is undertaken by the Ministry of
Labor in ten centers giving instruction in some six industrial trades. At Rabat
there is also a center for the training of typists, shorthand-typists, and
bookkeepers. Instructors for these several courses receive traiining in a well-
equipped institution at Casablanca.



- 8 -
33.     Admission to the industrial courses is limited to candidates of
minimum age 16 years, possessing the certificate of primary education. A
competitive examination in arithmetic, geometry, and mechanical comprehension
reduces the entry to about 1 in 10. The course, normally of one year's
duration, is highly specialised and devotes 32 hours per week to workshop
training and trade technology:  the remaining 8 hours are given to workshop
calculations, technical drawing, and general technology. Termi.nal tests
are set by the Ministry of Labor which awards certificates of competency to
those who are successful, generally some 80%. The total number of trainees
in attendance is approximately 800, of whomn 83 are taking cormercial courses.

III.  EDUCATION FINQ1NCE
Total Expenditure
34.       Over the period 1956 to 1964 total expenditure by the ilinistry of
Education rose from DH 179 million to DH 474.7 million, representing 13.2 per-
cent and 16.2 percent of the respective annual total national budgets. The
capital expenditure component was DH 32 million in 1956 and DH h10 million in
1964.  Current expenditure increased continuously at an average annual rate
of 14.5 percent from DH 147 million to DH 434.8 million (Annex VII).
35.       Capital expenditure over the last six years of the period (Annex
VIII)averaged some DH33 million per annum of which 53 percent was allocated
to primary education, 13 percent to secondary general education, and 17 per-
cent to technical education:  other allocations were teacher training 9.5 per-
cent, higher education 6.5 percent, and administration 1 percent.  During the
last six years efforts were directed at providing the physical facilities for
expanding primary education and primary teacher training. The increase in
current expenditures on primary education and teacher training was considerabie
in 1961 when these physical facilities w.Tere completed. In 1964 current expen-
diture (Annex VIII) was divided among primary education 58.1 percent, secondary
general education 18.6 percent, technical education 10.3 percent, higher edu-
cation 4.5 percent, teacher training 3.5 percent, private schools 3.2 percent,
and administration 1.8 percent.
36.       The major item under current expenditure is that of staff salaries
which have increased during the same six.-year period from DH 179.6 million
to DH 391.6 million (Annex VIII). Over the same period of time other current
expenditure, including maintenance, laboratory and workshop materials and
books, has decreased from DII 45.7 million in 1959 to DR 43.3 million in 1964
after passing through a peak of DH 56 million in 1962. The impact of the
consequent shortages upon the instruction given has been the subject of previo:s
i6           comment (paras 17-19).
37.       In assessing total educational expenditure note must be taken of
some DH 13 million expended by 15 other ministries and public or semi-public
bodies having their oam training programs and of some DH 10 million spent by
private schools in addition to subsidies of DH 14 million received from Govern-
ment.  Schools directly financed by the French Govermment accounted for a
combined capital and current expenditure (1964) of DR 51.07 million.  The
French Government also made grants of DE 1.1 million for equipment and of
DI 12.0 million towards the extra cost (estimated at DH 70 million) of employ-
ing French nationals in the service of the Ministry of Education. For the same
year assistance was received from U.S,AID to the value of DH 0.4 million.  In
sum, other expenditures not included in the Yiinistry of Education budget would
amount to DH 87.6 million. No tuition fees are charged at primary and secondarJt
levels and most boarders receive bursaries to cover their expenses.
38.       The total educational expenditure from all sources during 1964 was
therefore of the order of DH 562 million or 4.7% of an estimated G.N.P. of
DII 11,950 million.  Considering Ministry of Education expenditure only, the
proportion vias 4.0 u. as compared with 2.4% in 1956. The following table

showing the percentage of public educational expenditure to G.N.P. for other
Mediterranean countries is taken from OECD Mediterranean Regionial Project
reports (1964).

Cost per student
39.       The unit cost per student for government primary education was
D;H 246 ($49.2) per year in 1964, a figure which falls within the normal
range for developing countries. The overall unit cost for secondary
education was DH 1,184 ($236.8) p.a. in the same year. The available data
do   not permit an exact breakdown of this figure between general and
technical education but estimates of DH 1,025 ($205) and DH 2,050 ($410)
would appear to be reasonableiComparable overall figures for unit costs of
secondary education in other developing countries are Uganda $i250, Ghana
$345, Madagascar t,583, and Niger $625 p.a.



IV. NATIONAL DEVEIOPMENT PLANS LND MANPOWER NEEDS
140.      The Five-Year Plan 1960-1964 directed national development towards
impro-vements of infrastructure and social services involving public investment
for which there was small matching return in increased production and national
savings. The continued growth of population of 3 percent per arnunm and the
high rate of unemployment call for a change of objective and the Tlhree-Year
Plan, 1965-1967, is therefore largely directed to economic growth and manpower
training. The new Plan pays particular attention to agriculture, industry and
tourism. Special care has been taken to keep public expenditure within real-
istic and reasonable limits.  The total net investment as forecast in the Plan
is of the order of DH 3,480 million (Annex IX-A).  But this amoumt should be
corrected to include (1) amortization, renewal of existing assets and replace-
ment of stocks, and (2) private investments which cannot be easiLly assessed
and have not therefore been included, thus bringing the total gross investment
to DH 6,200 million.  External aid is estimated at more than DH 1,000 million
during the Plan period.
41.       Annex X shows the distribution of manpower by nationality and sex for
the major groups of economic activities (1960 census). Agriculture accounts
for 56 percent of the working population as compared with 20 percent for the
public services and 11 percent for industry. Annex XI shows the distribution
of manpower at different levels of employment in manufacturing imdertakings
having more than ten employees (1963).
Growth
42.       The implementation of the Three-Year Plan creates training require-
ments to match the expansion of the economy. Unfortunately, the data avail-
able are too fragmentary to permit reasonable estimates of the training needs
except in the four sectors of education, agriculture, industry and tourism
upon which special emphasis is to be laid. The need for secondary school
teachers has been shown in para 26 to be of the order of 4,850 iduring the Plan
period, to which should be added about 5,000 primary school teachers.
a   3.    In agriculture it is estimated that some 600 engineers, 50 veterin-
arians, 300 extension officers, and 2,000 assistant extension officers will be
needed to develop fully the existing agricultural provision and to meet the
increased livestock, wheat, and sugar production called for by the Plan. This
demand represents the employment of almost all who will graduate from the
middle level agricultural schools of the Ministry of Education and the higher
institutions of the Ministry of Agriculture. Land reclamation, irrigation,
afforestation, and road construction will employ increasing numbers of un-
skilled workers and will call for special training schemes for a large number
of supervisors.
44.       Public investment in industry will be directed to the food and
chemical industries, while private investment will be responsible for the
metal and other industries.  Using existing ratios, of an estimated additional
labor force of about 8,700, some 360 will require university education, some
890 secondary general or commercial education, and 1,660 secondary technical
education.



- 12 -
45.       In tourism, the projected expansion will call for a further 8,000
workers of whom approximately one-third will require specialized hotel train-
ing following first cycle secondary education.  About 100 higher level per.
sonnel will need to be trained at the hotel school in Rabat following second
cycle secondary education.
46.       The remaining fields of activity account for about 22 percent of the
labor force and include a number of services such as health, transport, and
communications, in which the demand for training, including up-grading, is
likely to be relatively high. The total need is roughly estimated at 7,000
first and second cycle graduates.
Replacement
417.      Annex XI shows that in manufacturing undertakings a hiph proportion
of Moroccan needs at the higher and middle levels of employment is met by
expatriates; this is known to be true in certain other fields. It is estimated
that replacement of expatriates by Mloroccans at "high level" wiLl call for an
output of 1,500 university graduates per year over a period of twenty years
and at "middle level" replacement some 4,000 secondary school graduates (1,900
with general and commercial training and 2,100 with technical training) will be
needed each year over the same period.  In the case of the mining industry,
however, :4oroccanization is to be completed by 1970 calling for am annual out-
put of 100 engineers and managers and 200 technicians over a period of five years.
48.       In sum, to meet the expansion of the economy and expatriate replace-
ment needs, a yearly minimum of 19,000 secondary school graduates of the first
and second cycles will be required during the Three-Year Plan. In 1964/65 the
output from the "short" and "long" courses will be about 10,200 niot counting
students who after completing the first cycle of the "long" course will not
proceed to the second cycle. Thus there will be a shortage of 8,800 which can-
not be met from the present secondary school output. By the end of the Plan
period secondary school enrolment will increase by 98,300 (Annex VI) and annual
output from the "short" and "long" courses by 15,600 with 30 percent of both
increases due to the proposed project. Therefore the new output will gradually
meet the shortage.
49.       To meet the cost of the additional training required, government
investment in education, forming 3.5 percent of the national investment fore-
casts for the Three-Year Plan, will be directed principally to secondary and
higher education in that order (Annex IX-B). As a result, total current ex-
penditures on education will increase from DH 435 million in l9611 to an esti-
mated DH 550 million in 1969. Assuming a rate of growth of 2-3 percent per
annum, the national current budget will increase from DH 2.,144 million in 1964
to DH 2,425 million in 1969.  Consequently, the share of total current educa-
tion expenses which represented 20.3 percent of the national current budget in
1964 will be of the order of 22.7 percent in 1969. This is comparable with the
corresponding percentage in countries at the same stage of development.

V. THE PROJECT
50.       The proposed project involves the construction and equipmaent of 21
multilateral schools providing instruction and training at the secondary level
for a total enrolment of about 30,000 students and an annual output in 1967/68
of about 4,200.  The "short" and "long" courses offered comprise Arabic and
modern studies, experimental science, mathematics, economics, industrial and
feminine training, agriculture and co=merce. The total cost of the project is
estimated at DH 80.7 million (US$16.2 million). The Moroccan Government share
toward the cost of the project will be met from the amount of DHI 83 million
(US$16.6 million) earmarked for secondary and technical education in the
planned investment program 1965/67 (Annex IX-B).
51.       The urgent need for more secondary school graduates comprises the
estimated requirements of the Three-Year Plan and the gradual reiplacement of
expatriates in various sectors.  The total need is estimated at 19,000 grad-
uates (para 48) per annum from the first or second cycle of secondary education.
The expansion of secondary education to meet the increased need as envisaged
in the Three-Year Plan (Annex VI) and which includes the proposeld project, will
increase total secondary school enrolment from 113,981 in 1964/65 to 212,251
in 1967/68, by which time, if the envisaged expansion is fully realized, the
net increase in enrolment will be 98,300 of which the schools inL the project
will cover about 30 percent. Annual output in 1967/68 will be 25,800 from the
"long" and "short" secondary courses with an increase of 15,600 over that of
1964/65.
52.       The proposed project will provide combined "short" and  "lor.g" courses
in 16 schools; the remaining five schools will offer "short" courses only
(Annex XIII). Of the latter, four will have agricultural courses only and one
will offer training in industrial arts and commerce. When the project is fullyr
implemented, say, by the academic year 1968/69, it is expected that the 21
schools will have the enrolment shown in the following table:

Total       29,675



- 14 -
53.       Of the total number of students benefiting from the proposed project,
about 5,700 ( 19 percent) will be girls and 24,000 will be boys ( 81 perceat).
Boarding accommodation available only to students of rural areas, or smaller
towns far from the schoo'ls, will be provided for 3,420 students (2,570 boys
and 930 girls) in 19 of the 21 schools. The existing practice, which will be
continued, winl provide a high percentage of the boarding students with
scholarships offered by the Ministry of Education or the provincial governueits
54.       The expansion in the secondary school enrolment under the proposed
project will relieve pressure on the existing secondary school facilities and
wiLL help to provide part of the need referred to in para 51. In particular,
it will raise the number of students in the top class of the "long" course in
government schools from about 2,300 at the end of the academic year 1963/6L
to nearly 3,700 students by the end of the academic year 1967/68.
55.       The locations of the 21 schools which constitute the proposed project
are shown on the map at the end of this report; it will be seen that they are
evenly distributed over the entire country.
56.       Annex XII shows a breakdown of the total cost with the number of
students and boarders in each school. A fuller description of the formation
of classes in each school and the number of students in each class by type --
of education and training is given in Annex XIII. The total number of class-
rooms to be constructed is 630 but,by making full use of laboratories and
workshops and by arranging physical training classes in the open air, a total
of 830 classes can be accommodated.
57.       A number of sites have already been purchased and there should be
little or no difficulty in acquiring the others since Governmenit is able to
invoke an existing land expropriation law permitting immediate possession of
sites for public use, leaving the question of cost to be settled in court, if
necessary. Ample areas are provided for building the proposed schools except
in a few of the larger towns where the areas, though smaller, are still
sufficient. For each of the four agricultural schools between 40 and 50
hectares (100 to 125 acres) should be provided in order to justify the use of
agricultural machinery.
58.       The following table} condensed from Annex XII, gives the estimated
cost of the proposed project:
Table No. 6: Summary of Project Cost

59.       The lists of equipment and furniture have been carefully examined
and, where necessary, revised with regard to costs and quantities; as they
now stand, the lists will provide the schools with adequate equipment for
efficient teaching. In the equipment estimates provision has been made for a
20 percent addition to cover packaging, shipment, and insurance.
60.       The Moroccan government has accepted the principle of international
bidding for the construction of schools within the proposed project and for
the supply of equipment; but has requested that, where specific requirements
can be met, local manufacturers, principally in the field of school furniture,
should be given reasonable preference.
61.       The Moroccan govermnent expected to complete the project in three
years   This did not ta'ke into account the preparation period which may take
one year and the winding-up period which may extend over another year. With
this in mind it is more realistic to assume that a total of five years would
be required. Annex XIV, drawn up on this basis, shows that expenditure
should be phased as follows:
lst year - $2,767,000    3rd year - P,5,730,000    5th year - $   955,0Oo
2nd year -  3,820,000    hth year - 2,865,Ooo    TOTAL:        16,137,000
(say - $16.2 million)
62.       From the data available on teachers, salaries and other budgetary
expenditures, the recurrent yearly expenditure on the 21 schools beginning
with the academic year 1968/69 will amount to about DH 25 million or 4.5% of
the projected current education budget of DH 550 million for that year
(see para.49).
63.       The number of teachers required to staff the school of the proposed
project when fully implemented will be about 1,300 and is already included
in the analysis of the need and supply of teachers discussed in paragraphs
25, 26 and 27, where it was suggested that the shortage over the first three
years should be met by the appointment of senior primary teachers on a
temporary basis as an emergency measure. The Moroccan Government should,
therefore, undertake to keep the regional primary teacher training schools
running at full load to produce the maximum output to meet the emergency.
64.       The cost per place under the project is about US$294 per day student
including sites, equipment and fumiture. The additional cost for boarding
accommodation with furniture and equipment is US$1,130 per student. These unit
costs are reasonable and compare well with corresponding costs in countries
similar to Morocco. In European countries the cost per place fDr day students
is about twice the cost calculated for the day schools in the proposed project.

VT. CONSTRUCTION
65.       General:  In comparison with other developing countries, architectura
design and building construction are of good standard, construction costs
are reasonable and public buildings are generally well maintained. French
influence with regard to town plamning, architectural design and construction
is strong and the use of French imported materials continues.
66.       The increase in building activity and in construction costs followinw
Independence has now slowed down and the industry should have no difficulty
in meeting the requirements of the proposed project.
67.       Contracting Finms:  Building finms are of three general types:
foreign firms or branches, large Moroccan firms, and small "jobbing" builders.
There are about 830 Moroccan and 1,400 foreign finms, mostly French engaged
in the building trade. There is no shortage of general labor but skilled
craftsmen and supervisors, such as foremen and clerks of works, are much
needed.
68.       Moroccan building materials are in adequate supply, but steel,
sanitary fittings, electrical equipment and various other items must be
imported.
69.       Professional Services:  The Ministry of Public Works was fonmerly
staffed alnost entirely with expatriates but since Independence they are
being gradually replaced by Moroccans. There are a considerable number of
private architects and engineers, who are for the most part French trained,
but only 20 to 30 are being used by the Ministry of Education. There are
highly qualified professional men residing in the country who may be selected
for the execution of the proposed project.
70.       Quantity surveying does not exist as an independent profession but
"metreurs" fulfill a similar function.
71.       School Design, Construction Proceduire and Maintenance: Responsibility
for the design of school buildings rests with the Ministry of 3ducation which,
until recently, employed its own architect;  the death of the Latter has create(
a vacancy which the Ministry has not so far filled.
72.       Building laws and regulations, which vary slightly in different parts
of the country, are based on the French patterm and are enforced by the
Ministry of Public Works in consultation with the Ministry of Health and local
authorities. Existing school buildings, however, show considerable variety
in quality, economy, finish and space allocation.
73.       Tendering, bidding and contract awards for school construction follow
an acceptable system. W4ith few exceptions tendering is public and advertised
in the local papers: for the proposed project the government will invite



- 17 -
international bidding wherever practicable. Opening of tenders and the
awTard of contracts rest with a special commission within the M-Lnistry of
Education. For the purpose of this project architects and bui:Lders contracts
should be modified in order to meet the Bank/IDA requirements,
74.     Schools constructed within the last nine years have been designed by
private architects who were also responsible for supervision and for
authorization of payment to contractors.  Further supervision, particularly
for the enforcement of building laws and regulations, is the responsibility
of the Ministry of Public Works.
75.     Funds for the maintenance of school buildinlgs are controlled by local
representatives of the Ministry of Education, each of whom di stributes his
allocation according to the individual needs of the schools in his province.
Despite the limited funds available for this purpose, the buildlings are
well maintained.    1
76.     Schematic Drawings for the Proposed Project:  The standardized
drawings for t            Ichools in the proposed project have been carefully
studied. Seven schools of similar design have already been built and some
of these were visited. The architectural design is acceptab'Le, the
construction methods used are sound and the unit costs compared with other
recently constructed schoo'ls of different design show that this type is more
economical.
77.    The standardized design for the proposed project is based on a unit
block of ten classrooms. It is intended to use the same unit block for
dormitories and laboratory buildings, but such facilities do not exist in
the seven schools already constructed.
78.     The proposed sizes of administration and staffrooms, classrooms,
laboratories, dormitories, kitchens and workshops, and their lighting and
ventilation were studied and found generally adequate.  In certain cases,
however, the space allowied for laboratories and workshops was considered
excessive and the Ministry and consulting architect have agreeid to
revise plans on more economical lines.
79.     UTsing the schematic drawings as a basis, detailed plans are to be
prepared for each individual school, modifications being made to meet local
conditions.  The 1Iinistry intends to commission about 10 to 15 architects,
each of whom will design and supervise one or two schools.
80.     Sites for most of the proposed schools have been selected and in some
cases already acquired; those seen were suitably situated and adequate ir
size but soil tests had not yet been carried out. The average site purchase
price seems reasonable.
81, For the purpose of the project, the W4oroccan government has agreed to se
up within the Ministry of Education a special Project Unit consisting of an
architect, an educator with wide experience in school construction, an account-
ant and adequate secretarial and technical supporting staff.

VII. CONICLUSIONS AND BECOlvIIENDATICNS
Conclusions
82.       The orogress so far achieved in expanding facilities for primary
education in Morocco has been adequate considering the country's finances.
But secondary school places are now very limited in number and require
expansion, As they now stand they are quite inadequate to meet the country's
needs particularly if the government policy of the gradual replacement of
expatriates by Moroccans is implemented. They are also insufficient to meet
the requirements of the Three-Year Plan and the expanding needs of government
and public services and private enterprise.
83.       The school system in both primary, secondary and higher education is
now based on French patterns.  Some time must elapse before the! Moroccan
Ministry of Education will be able to evolve curricula more adapted to the
country's needs. The academic nature of the first cycle of the "long" course
should be remedied by the introduction of physics, chemistry and educational
handicrafts. At the same time the present theoretical approach to sciences,
caused by the inadequacy of laboratory equipment for use by the students and
by the lack of appreciation in some cases on the teachers' part of the
importance of laboratory work, should also be remedied. Steps should also be
taken to remedy the shortage of textbooks.
84.       The shortcomings in technical training discussed in paragraphs 20
and 21 should be taken into account and measures should be implemented for
improvement. Contacts between industry and schools with technical training
sections should be established and curricula and training programs should be
revised to improve the prospects of employment for the graduating students.
In connection with training in the "short" courses, government intention to
extend the present system for one year in the "observation class" to two years
will diminish the time left for practical work and consequently make the
graduates less acceptable to industry. The IMinistry of Education has agreed
to give serious consideration to this matter.
85.       The problem of repeaters should be remedied. The extra cost involvec
in pexmitting a high percentage of repeaters, reaching 20 percent of the class
in many cases, should prompt the Ministry of Education to take measures to
reduce this percentage appreciably. Another aspect of economy concerns the
weekly teaching loads which government intends to increase next year. The
proposed increase, from 16 to 18 weekly hours in the case of secondary school
teachers holding university degrees will not have any ill effect on teaching,
and government should not hesitate to put this intention into effect, and
later even go beyond it. A third aspect which also has its effect on economy
is for the Moroccan Government to seek the replacement of the less qualified
expatriate teachers by better qualified expatriates.



- 19 -
86.       The need for the proposed project is summarized in paragraph 51.
It is clear that the output of graduates from the schools included in the
project and from the planned expansion of the existing secondary schools will
not meet the whole of the country's requirements but will be a substantial
contribution toward fulfilling the need. Of special interest are the proposed
four agricultural schools whose output of graduates is expected to be entirely
absorbed in meeting the country's requirements in the agricultural sector.
87.       The schematic drawings submitted with the Moroccan Government
request for IDA financing of the 21 schools constituting the project, have
been revised where necessary and are now considered reasonable. The sizes of
classrooms, laboratories and workshops are acceptable and in the few cases
where laboratories and workshops were found excessive the Ministry of Education
has agreed to more economical plans. Detailed plans for each individual school
will now be prepared on the basis of the schematic drawings. They should be
submitted for final approval by IDA.  Suitable sites for most of the proposed
0            schools have been acquired and there will be no difficulty in acquiring
the rest.
88.       A breakdown of the cost of the project is shown in Annex XII.  All
the items of costs have been examined and revised where necessaLry. In arriving
at an estimate of building cost, use has been made of the actual expenditure
incurred on seven schools of similar design which have already been con-
structed. The cost of equipment for laboratories, workshops arLd boarding
sections are now reasonable.
89.       It has been shown (paras.25-27) that for the secondary school
expansion envisioned in the Three-Year Plan the output of trained teachers
will fall short of the need in the first three years of expansion. As an
emergency measure senior primary school teachers will have to be used to staff
the lower secondary classes of the general course. No secondary school
expansion in developing countries has ever been possible without recourse to
some such emergency measures.
90.       The increase in the current expenditure created by the project when
fully implemented will be about DH 25 million (US$5.0 million) by 1968/69
and is within the ability of the Moroccan Government to meet. As shown in
para.62 it is only 4.5% of the education recurrent budget estimated for
1968/69. It should be noted in this connection that no spectacular increase
in primary school enrolment is expected in the coming years and a good part
of the increase in the education recurrent budget will go toward the expansion
of secondary education.
Recommendations
91.       Subject to the conditions set out hereunder, which meet the
recommendations made in the earlier paragraphs of this report, the proposed
project provides a suitable basis for financing by IDA. It is, therefore,



- 20 -
recommended that an IDA development credit be made to the Moroccan government
in the amount of U.S.$1l million or about two-thirds of the total cost of the
proposed project including professional fees, contingencies and estimated rise
in prices during the project implementation period. This will cover all the
foreign currency component and part of the local currency costs. In addition
to the usual conditions attached to IDA developments credits, th,e Moroccan
government has agreed:
(a)  to accept competitive international bidding for the supply
of equipment and for construction wherever practicable;
(b)  to provide funds for completing the proposed project;
(c)  to implement the planned expansion of the Advanced Teacher
Training College at Rabat and its branches to meet the need
of secondary school expansion;
(d)  to provide 40 to 50 hectares (100 to 125 acres) for each of
the four agricultural schools included in the project;
(e)  to make available the necessary funds for the operationi the
21 schools in the proposed project and to maintain tlhem
adequately;
(f)  to set up in the Ministry of Education a special Project Unit
for administering and supervising the project during the whole
implementation period which should consist of an experienced
architect approved by IDA and assisted by an educator with
wide experience in school construction, an accountant anid
adequate secretarial and technical supporting staff;
(g) to employ qualified and experienced architects and engineers
in the execution of the project;
(h) (i)  to strengthen the teaching of sciences in schools,
(ii) to improve the quality of specialized training in the
"College Moyen" and increase the time allotted to students'
work in the workshops,
(iii) to make additional studies and efforts to reduce the number
of repeaters, and
(iv) to take measures to improve the present situation with
regard to school textbooks.

NOTES ON TABLES
Table 1 - The curriculum is the same for all students but there is selection
between long and short courses, only the more able being admitted
to the former.
Tables 2 and 3 -  The tables offer a selection only of long courses leading to
university entrance or to a technical diploma. The former includes
classical and modern studies, experimental science, mathematics, and
economics; the latter includes industrial and commercial studies
normally followed by employment.  The commercial curriculum shown in
Table 3 is intended for boys and stresses accountanc;y, whereas
that for girls stresses secretarial work.
Table 4 - The short course in general education differs from the first cycle
of the long course mainly in the absence of a second foreign language
and in the introduction of ohysics and chemistry. The examination
for a certificate of secondary education may be taken by students
of both courses.
The secretarial course is taken by girls and differs in the third

year only from a corresponding bookkeeping course for boys.
In addition to dressmaking, somewhat similar courses are available
in tailoring, hairdressing, domestic service, and child welfare.
Table 5 -  The industrial courses are broadly based with increasing speciali-
zation in the third and, where available, optional fourth years.
In this and other tables "physics" may include "applied mechanics"
and "electricity".
