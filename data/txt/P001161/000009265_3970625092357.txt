Country Brief
REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
I. TEE ECONOMY
1.        In the Report No. 1147-IVC "Ivory Coast:  A Basic Economic
Report", circulated in May 1977 and published in 1978 under the title
"Ivory Coast: The Challenge of Success", the Bank presented an in-depth
analysis of the country's economic performance during its first fifteen
years of independence. In recent months, economic missions visited the
C^ote d'Ivoire to review economic developments since the beginning of the
eighties and to examine the medium and long-term policy alternatives facing
the country. The findings of these missions are reflected in what
follows. 1/ Annex I provides basic country data.
2.        With a GNP per capita of US$610 in 1984, the Cote d'Ivoire ranks
well ahead of its neighbors within the West African Economic Community.
Its population of 9.9 million is growing at a rate of 4.5Z per year, of
which 3.5 percent natural and 1Z net immigration. Since independence in
1960, the country has enjoyed a remarkable degree of political stability
which, combined with favorable resource endowments and a steady inflow of
cheap labor from neighboring Sahelian countries, has been conducive to
rapid economic development. The last Party Congress held in October 1985
clarified the procedures for an orderly transfer of power, in which the
President of the National Assembly would become the interim President for a
period of up to 60 days, pending the calling into session of a special
Party Congress for the expressed purpose of choosing a Presidential
successor.
Background
3.        During the decade extending from the mid-sixties to the mid-
seventies, the development of the Cote d'Ivoire was characterized by rapid
economic growth and by profound structural changes within a relatively
stable external environment. This growth and associated structural change
was achieved without major internal or external macroeconomic imbalances.
By contrast, during the second half of the seventies, the C6te d'lvoire
experienced a rapid succession of external shocks including a coffee and
cocoa boom from 1975 to 1977, a rapid deterioration in the market condi-
tions for these commodities from 1977 to 1979 and a sharp increase in
import prices in 1979. The net result was a 27% deterioration in the terms
of trade between 1977 and 1980.
1/   A full-fledged Economic Report is presently being discussed with the
Government and will be circulated to the Board shortly.



-2-
4.        Following the rapid increase in CAISSTAB revenues resulting from
the boom in coffee and cocoa prices, the Government embarked on an over-
ambitious public investment program which was mainly diredted toward large
projects with high unit costs and low rates of economic returns. Between
1975 and 198d, public investment increased 2.5 times in real terms, and its
financing became increasingly dependent on foreign borrowing when CAISSTAB
surpluses started to dwindle after 1978.  In parallel, the economic poli-
cies followed by the Government progressively weakened the long-term growth
potential of the productive sectors.  The rapid expansion of the money
supply led to a rise in domestic inflation with a consequent deterioration
in the purchasing power parity index. Inadequate adjustments in producer
prices for export crops led to an increased discrimination against the
agricultural sector. The Government responded to the intensified import
competition by imposing quantitative import restrictions in the industrial
sector. This policy led to sharp increases in effective protection and to
a growing anti-export bias in the sector, and further aggravated the
discrimination against agriculture in the system of incentives.
5.        Fueled by the rapid expansion of public investment, GDP grew at a
real average annual rate of 7.6Z between 1975 and 1980. This continued
expansion of public investment contributed to a sharp increase in the
overall deficit of the public sector. As a result, medium- and long-term
debt outstanding increased from 17.8 to 35.2% of GDP between 1975 and 1980.
The current account deficit went from 8.2 to 17.4% of GDP over the same
interval and the increase in foreign capital inflows to the public sector
was not sufficient to offset this deterioration. By 1980, the overall
deficit of the balance of payments had reached 7.7% of GDP, and the Cote
d'Ivoire had exhausted its official reserves.
Launching The Structural Adjustment Process
6.        Faced with a rapid deterioration of the economic and financial
situation, the Government launched a structural adjustment program at the
end of 1981 with the objectives of stabilizing the economy, improving
macroeconomic management and laying the foundation for a resumptior. of
growth in the medium to long term. This program was supported by two
Structural Adjustment Loans from the Bank in 1981 and 1983, and an EFF from
the Fund in 1981.
7.        The Goverment's structural adjustment program was based on two
major components, namely, (i) a series of immediate policy actions with the
objective of correcting in the shorter term the most obvious deficiencies
in monetary and fiscal policy and in the system of economic incentives; and
(ii) an initial reassessment of the development strategy with the objective
of implementing far-reaching policy reforms for restoring self-sustained
growth over the longer term.
8.        Under the first component, the Government moved forcefully to
apply a set of stabilization measures, including: (i) a tightening of
domestic credit to the public and parapublic sectors; (ii) an interest rate
policy designed to encourage domestic resource mobilization and to limit



-3-
transfers abroad; (iii) a sharp reduction in public current and capital
expenditures in real terms; (iv) a reform of public investment programming;
(v) a reform of the parapublic sector to reduce its burden on public
finances and to improve its efficiency; and (vi) producer price increases
for cash and food crops.
9.        Concurrently, as part of the second component, the Government
proceeded to: (i) improve the institutional efficiency of macroeconomic
management; (ii) rationalize the public investment program; (iii) improve
the external debt management system; (iv) design and introduce the first
stage of a comprehensive reform of the system of industrial incentives
aimed at reducing protection, increasing efficiency and eliminating the
anti-export bias in the sector; and (v) initiate a process leading to a
comprehensive reform of the agricultural incentive system, including
producer prices, input subsidies, and the external trade regime.
Recent Economic Performance: 1981-1985
10.       Judging by its performance between 1981 and 1985, the Cote
d'Ivoire economy has shown a good response to the structural adjustment
program. Stabilization measures were strictly pursued even though
slippages did occur in 1982 and 1983 as a result of factors beyond the
control of Government. These included an increase in real rates of
interest in international financial markets, lower than forecast domestic
oil output, a decline in external terms of trade in 1981 and 1982, and a
severe drought in 1983. Starting in 1984, the Government redoubled its
adjustment efforts with impressive results in the fiscal and balance of
payments areas. However, the structural adjustment process so far has not
achieved the change in the relative prices of tradeable and non-tradeable
goods required to reallocate resources towards production for exports. 2/
Also, although the Government implemented a series of producer price
increases for major crops, progress in the implementation of the structural
adjustment program in agriculture has been slower than expected.
11.       After registering a slightly positive growth in real GDP of
1.2 percent in 1981, the C^te d'Ivoire economy suffered three successive
years of negative growth from 1982 to 1984. The poor performance in
1982-84 was the result of a confluence of factors, namely the series of
negative exogenous shocks mentioned earlier and the imposition of austerity
measures associated with the structural adjustment program. In 1985,
however, the latest estimates show a strong resumption of GDP growth
(4.9%).
12.       The drastic measures taken by Government since 1981 tc reduce
public expenditures, together with a sharp increase in CAISSTAB revenues,
2/   Taking 1980 as a base, the in.:ex of the relative price of tradeable
and non-tradeable goods was estimated to be 97.5 in 1984.



led to a major improvement of the public finance situation over the 1980-
1985 period. Government consumption expenditures were cut by 13.8% in real
terms between 1980 and 1985, as a result of the implementation of a wide
range of cost-reducing measures. The adjustment was even more drastic with
respect to the Government's investment program, which was reduced by 81.9%
in real terms over the same interval. As a result, the Government deficit,
which reached 13.1% of GDP in 1981, declined steadily to 0.2% of GDP in
1984, and turned into a surplus estimated at 0.2Z in 1985.
13.       Between 1980 and 1985, the Government succeeded in stabilizing
the loss to GDP ratio of the para-public sector at less than 1 percent. At
the same time, the ratio of Government transfers to public enterprises with
respect to GDP, after increasing from 2.5Z in 1980 to 8.4% in 1984,
declined to 6.9% in 1985. The financing requirements of the parapublic
sector decreased from 11.6Z of GDP in 1982 to 3.7% in 1985. This
remarkable improvement was the direct result of the structural adjustment
measures taken by Government, including a more flexible tariff policy, a
strengthening of controls on foreign borrowing by public enterprises, and
the strengthening of operational efficiency of key enterprises.
14.       Between 1980 and 1985, the goods and services balance improved
dramatically, from a deficit of 5.4Z of GDP to a surplus of 13.9Z. This
evolution was essentially the result of the sharp reduction in imports due
to the expenditure-reducing effects of the stabilization program. Between
1980 and 1985, imports of goods and services declined by a cumulative 44.1Z
in current dollar terms, while exports of goods and services increased by
1.7% per year in real terms, mainly as a result of the growth in cocoa
output.
15.       Until 1983, the improvement in the goods and services balance did
not translate into a corresponding improvement of the current balance,
whose deficit remained at about 13% of GDP, mainly due to the increase in
interest payments on external public debt. Net capital inflows to the
public sector declined abruptly in 1983, reflecting increased difficulties
experienced by the Government in mobilizing fresh money from private
financing sources. As a result, the overail balance of payments deficit
widened considerably. Since 1983, the current balance situation has shown
a dramatic improvement, going from a deficit of 13.3% of GDP to a surplus
of 1.0% in 1985. The increase in net capital inflows to the public sector
made possible by the rescheduling of external debt (and Bank SALs)
accentuated this positive tendency, and the overall balance showed a
surplus of 4.4% of GDP in 1985.
16.       Between 1980 and 1984, the share of medium and long-term debt
outstanding (excluding IMF) in GDP increased from 41.3 to 73.6%.  As of
December 31, 1984, medium and long-term debt outstanding amounted to US$4.8
billion, of which 58.9% was due to private financing sources.  Based on the
amount of debt outstanding as of December 31, 1984, it is clear that the
debt burden will remain very high through 1989.  Only in 1990 is the debt
service ratio expected to decline rapidly, marking the easing of the debt
overhang. The debt profile shows that, even in the absence of new



borrowings and before reschedulings, the Cote d'Ivoire will need in excess
of US$1.0 billion a year until 1989 to meet its existing (end 1984)
external debt obligations (including IMF).
Medium Term Prospects: 1986-1990
17.       After four years of austerity under the first phase of the
structural adjustment program, the Government is determined to achieve a
successful transition to the growth-oriented phase of the program, which
will be based on the following orientations: (i) an export-oriented growth
strategy along the lines of comparative advantage based on a progressive
opening up of the economy to the pressures of market forces; (ii) a
retrenchment of the public sector towards the types of activities for which
it is best suited (supportive role to production and exports) in order to
allow the private sector to play its leading role in directly productive
activities; and (iii) the design of a strategy to alleviate the debt burden
over the medium term, thereby freeing resources for a return to a medium
term growth path which will restore international creditworthiness and
raise per capita incomes.
18.       The Bank's view of the medium-term prospects for Cote d'Ivoire is
based on a feasible scenario assuming the intensification of the Govern-
ment's structural adjustment program.
19.       The scenario indicates that continuation of tight monetary and
fiscal policies, coupled with a broadening of incentive reforms in the
productive sectors and a solution to the debt overhang, are essential to
steer the economy towards a sustainable medium-term growth path. Under
this scenario, GDP is projected to grow by 2.1% per annum on average
between 1986 and 1990, representing a decline of about 2.0% per year in GDP
per capita. The achievement of this growth rate will essentially depend on
the growth of the productive sectors, namely agriculture and manufacturing.
This in turn will depend on the Government's determination to constrain the
growth of the public sector in order to free domestic resources for the
financing of private investment. This scenario implies that the private
sector will progressively become the engine of growth as public sector
retrenchment becomes a reality.
20.       The projections leads to a stabilization of the public finance
situation over the medium term. This outcome is made possible by (i)
multi-year rescheduling of external public debt in the context of the
London and Paris Clubs 3/ , (ii) the continued restraint in current and
capital expenditures, (iii) the reduction of Government transfers to public
enterprises, and (iv) the increase in fiscal receipts induced by the
3/   The Government has negotiated rescheduling arrangements througn the
London and Paris Clubs in the amounts of US$ 332 million in 1986, 301
in 1987, 246 in 1988 and 125 in 1989.

expansion of GDP and new tax measures. Also, the projections lead to a
stabilization of the balance of payments situation over the 1986-1990 Plan
horizon. This result depends essentially on the response of the economy to
the incentive reforms applied in the productive sectors, and in particular
on an expansion of manufactured exports. The external debt profile
obtained under the scenario shows a decline in the debt service ratio
during the critical 1986-1989 period, after MYRA rescheduling.
II. BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
21.       Since 1968, when Bank Group operations in the Cote d'Ivoire
started, lending has expanded rapidly and now includes 53 operations
totalling about US$1,500 million, including US$14 million from the Third
Window, and an IDA credit of US$7.5 million. Of these, 19 have been for
agriculture, supporting cotton, cocoa, rubber, forestry, oil palm and
coconut development, and rural development in the North-East Savannah and
Center-West regions. There were six road projects and two highway sector
projects. The remaining loans were for education, telecommunications, the
Abidjan sewerage and drainage system, water supply, urban development,
petroleum exploration and development, power distribution, tourism
development, small- and medium-scale enterprises, a regional cement
project, a regional railway project, structural adjustment and related
technical assistance, an industrial finance and development and a health
and demographic project. IFC has supported textile, fertilizers, flour
milling, development banking and agricultural plantation operations in the
country. In general, implementation of Bank projects has been satisfactory
and has improved substantially over the past five years. The disbursement
ratio (total disbursements of a fiscal year divided by undisbursed signed
commitments as of the beginning of the fiscal year) has increased over the
period 1982-1985 from 15.4% to 24.5Z (excluding SAIs), which compares to an
average evolution over the same period from 23.9% to 24% Bank-wide and from
20.7% to 19.1Z (excluding SALs) for West Africa.
22.       Until the early 1980s, when the Ivorian economy experienced a
rapid deterioration, Bank lending was project-oriented with the emphasis on
agricultural diversification, infrastructural development and education.
The change in the country's economic situation led to a substantial shift
in the direction of Bank lending in order to respond to the Government's
request for financial support of its stabilization program that it
initiated in 1981 in order to restore Cote d'Ivoire's economic performance.
Accordingly, during the past five years, Bank lending has focussed on
bringing about sustained structural adjustment, including improvement of
public finance, broad-based institution building and increased exposure to
market forces, while continuing direct support to the productive sectors
(agriculture, industry and energy) to foster economic growth. Building on
this stabilization effort, the Government is now moving towards the phase
of increasing economic growth, founded on a strategy of export-based
development. A third structural adjustment loan which was signed on
September 3, 1986 supports this phase.



- 7 -
23.       In conjunction with the First Structural Adjustment Loan, a
Technical Assistance Loan (FY82) was made to provide long- and short-term
assistance in the improvement of macro-economic and public sector
management and to carry out the necessary studies as the structural
adjustment program evolved (especially with regard to industrial and
agricultural incertives reform, management and financial rehabilitation of
public enterprises, and housing finance). In addition, the loan financed
studies to prepare several projects in the agricultural (research,
marketing) and infrastructure sectors (water supply). During
implementation of the project, the Government decided to reduce the cost of
dependence on foreign expertise and to accelerate Ivorianization. In
keeping with these objectives, the utilization of the remaining portion of
the loan is being directed to selective provision of technical assistance
in areas of long-term benefit.
24.       In agriculture, high priority has been given to sector work and
policy dialogue on a major reform of the incentive system (improved
producer prices, reduction of subsidies, promotion of exports through
rationalizing external commercial policy) and increased emphasis on
developing smallholder production. Bank lending is contributing to the
expansion of those subsectors with clear comparative advantages based on
low domestic resource cost and export diversification (rubber, oil palm,
coconut and cotton), so as to restore economic growth. In addition,
emphasis is being placed on strengthening agricultural services (extension,
research and input supply) to enable the sector to capture the evident
incremental potential of agricultural yields in both cash and food crops.
As a result of the various studies implemented under the Technical
Assistance Project, the Bank plans to help finance a credit and food crop
marketing project (FY87) and an agricultural research project (FY89S). In
forestry, the Bank will continue to support Government efforts to arrest
the rapid degradation of Cote d'Ivoire's forest resources, the country's
third foreign exchange earner and the principal source of cooking fuel for
the majority of the population. In a Second Forestry Project (FY89S), the
Bank provided further support to the Government's reforestation program and
to the strengthening of the institutional capability to define and
implement a coherent long-term forestry policy. A third forestry project
is planned for FY89.
25.       As a result of the policy reforms under the structural adjustment
process (tariff reform, introduction of an export compensatory scheme,
institutional rehabilitation), the industrial sector is expected to regain
its pre-1980 dynamism. In FY86, the Bank provided financing for an
Industrial Finance and Development project to help adjust industrial
enterprises to the effects resulting from a more liberal commercial policy
and to supplement the tight liquidity position of the commercial banks
following the recession after 1980. In the next few years, the Bank will
continue to assist the Government create an environment for efficient
resource mobilization and resource allocation by the banking system and
further promotion of privatization.



-8-
26.       Given its hydrocarbon and hydroelectric resources, the Cote
d'Ivoire has the potential to be self-sufficient in energy. However,
during the last few years the institutions responsible for energy supply
experienced substantial financial difficulties and acute power shortages
resulting from recent droughts on the one hand, and over-investments on the
other (refinery). This contributed to a large extent to the Government's
financial problems being addressed under the structural adjustment program.
Through this program and an energy sector loan project (FY89S) currently
being prepared, the Bank is lending support to the restoration of the
financial viability of the implementing institutions, and more generally,
to the rationalization of pricing policies (tariff reform) for the domestic
market.
27.       The Bank has been closely associated with the development of Cote
d'Ivoire's infrastructure and will continue to contribute to government
objectives of further strengthening institutional capability and financial
management and, where feasible, promote privatization. In transport, a
Second Highway Sector Loan was approved in FY85, cofinanced by commercial
banks in a first "B-loan" made in the African Region. The project aimed at
upgrading the country's road network, restoring road maintenance capacity
and fostering productivity improvements in the private road transport
industry. A port project is scheduled for FY88 to improve existing
facilities of Abidjan Port. In the urban subsector, the Bank will continue
to help finance maintenance and upgrading of the transport system in
Abidjan, in view of the critical importance of this city for the economy,
and contribute to institution building. In addition, with regard to
housing, the Bank will support government efforts to reduce public spending
on housing finance by involving the commercial banking system to a greater
extent and to transfer funds thus released to the provision of basic
infrastructure (land services). A third urban development project (FY87)
would incorporate these objectives. A municipality project is being
prepared as a first stage to improve the institutional capacity of local
government in maintaining existing facilities and infrastructure, and to
mobilize fiscal resou_ccs. Following a reorganization study of the water
supply and sewerage sectox initiated in 1984, a water supply and sewerage
sector adjustment loan (FY87) would further improve sector efficiency and
financial discipline by expanadng private management of part of the water
supply facilities with responsibilities currently held by the public
sector. The Second Telecommunication Project approved in FY86 supports
Government efforts to rehabilitate the existing network and to strengthen
the managerial, planning and administrative capacity of the National Office
of Telecommunications.
28.       In the social sectors, primary importance will be given to
improving education, to helping C^te d'Ivoire meet the requirements to
improve health care and to formulate an adequate approach to address the
issue of its fast-growing population. In education, the objectives will be
to reduce the high cost and improve the efficiency of the education system.
Efforts will be continued - both in the structural adjustment program and
in future project lending - to reduce the heavy burden of recurrent
expenditure for education on the Government's budget. A fourth education



-9-
project, which would pursue the above objectives, is planned for FY88. In
health and population, a Health and Demographic Project which was approved
by the Board In FY86 supports Government efforts to expand and improve the
quality of nurse training and to strengthen institutional and financial
management ii the health sector. A second project may be considered by the
end of the decade.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECf
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the Republic of Cote
d'Ivoire of US $34.0 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan
would carry a standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 20 years
including 5 years of grace and would help finance an agricultural extension
project.
2.        Background.  Agriculture in Cote d'Ivoire accounts for about
25 percent of GDP and over 60 percent of all merchandise exports.  It
provides employment to 77 percent of the total labor force and taxes on
export crops represent 30 percent of Government's annual revenues. The
agricultural sector will remain the predominant factor of Ivorian economic
growth over the next decade. Structurally, however, the circumstances for
its development have deteriorated: timber potential is declining; cocoa
production is projected to grow at about 6 percent per annum but may
potentially face falling world prices as the result of such expansion
because of Cote d'lvoire's dominant position in the world market; and
coffee production is on a downward trend because of the slowdown in new
plantings and the resulting ageing of plantations. Against this back-
ground, Government development strategy aims at: (a) optimizing coffee and
cocoa contribution to the economy through a new program to improve cocoa
quality, rehabilitate existing coffee plantations and plant new coffee;
Cb) promoting other export crops to ensure diversification and thus greater
export earnings stability; and (c) encouraging food crop production. The
success of this strategy is critically dependent upon a shift in incentives
in favor of the agricultural sector, to motivate farmers and permit invest-
ments in new technologies.  Such a shift is encouraged by appropriate
measures under the program supported by the Third Structural Adjustment
Loan (SAL III). However, for these measures to have their full effect, it
is essential that the farmers have access to improved technologies, which
in turn requires effective extension services.
3.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project would be the first
phase of a longer-term development effort which would introduce the main
principles of the Training and Visit system in the extension services of
Cote d'Ivoire's three main rural development agencies: SATMACI, SODEPALM
and CTDT. It would focus on (a) increasing extension coverage from the
present 25 percent to about 50 percent of the total number, of farmers,
through a better organization of field services; (b) extending simple crop
husbandry improvements and better means of using available modern inputs;
and (c) improving linkages between research and extension to ensure a
continuous flow of technologies well adapted to local needs and cons-
traints. The measures proposed under the project would improve the opera-
tional efficiency of the three extension agencies mostly by promoting a
better management of existing resources and ensuring regular flow of these
resources. The result would be streamlined institutions, able to implement
larger operational programs with small additional budget requirements.

4.        Project Description.  The proposed project would support the
agencies' improvement program over an initial four-year period through:
(a) the modification of their existing extension services to incorporate
the main principles of the Training and Visit system (systematic planning,
monitoring and technical backstopping of extension agents); regular,
continuous training of extension staff at all levels; and strengthening of
linkages between research and extension; and (b) the development of effec-
tive monitoring and evaluation and management information systems in each
agency and the improvement of their financial management. To support this
program, the project would finance: (a) additional staff for the agencies'
extension, training, adaptive research, and monitoring and evaluation
activities; (b) additional staff for the new adaptive research units of the
two main agricultural research agencies (IDESSA and IRCC); (c) the estab-
lishment of sub-regional research stations and small experimentation sites
in the forest zone; (d) construction of adequate training facilities;
(e) investments in transportation and in training, research and office
equipment; (f) incremental operating costs; and (g) technical assistance on
technical issues and financial and accounting management. The project
would follow-up on a pilot extension project, implemented in selected areas
over an 18-month period. A financing of US$2.5 million was provided under
the Bank-financed Technical Assistance Project to carry out the pilot
program, while the preparation of a full-scale extension project was
undertaken. The pilot project focussed on a few simple technical recommen-
dations for food and cash crops and demonstrated farmers' receptivity to
the new organization of extension services and to messages relevant to
their needs. The project would provide funds for vehicles, training,
research and office equipment, civil works, technical assistance, incremen-
tal staff and other operating costs. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US $58.5 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US $15.6 million (27Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements,
as well as the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Cnte d'Ivoire are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report (Number 6079-TVC) dated October, 1986
is being distributed separatelv.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project forms an integral
part of the Bank's sector development strategy of supporting Government's
policy of crop diversification, development of exports and increased
emphasis on smallholder agriculture. It is also closely related to the six
on-going agricultural projects in Cote d'Ivoire: a North-East Development
Project (1980), a Center-West Development Project (1982), a Technical
Assistance Project (1982) with an important agricultural component, a
Fourth Rubber Project (1983), a Second Forestry Project (1985) and a Fifth
Oil Palm Project (1986). In addition to the proposed agricultural exten-
sion project, five projects at identification/preparation stage are direct-
ly linked to Government's development strategy, which is fully endorsed by
the Bank: an Agricultural Sector Loan (FY87), an Agricultural Research
Project (FY88S), a Rubber Sector Project (FY88S), an Agricultural Marketing
and Credit Project (FY88), and an Export Diversification Project (FY89).



In general, implementation of Bank-financed projects has been satisfactory
and has improved substantially over the past five years.
6.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following
actions as conditions of effectiveness:   (1) setting-up of a Project
Steering Committee; (2) approval by Government of four medium-term program
contracts between extension agencies and research institutions and their
respective detailed adaptive research programs for the 1986/87 season;
(3) submission to the Bank of the audited closing balance sheets as of June
30, 1986 of two of the participating rural development agencies, and if
necessary, of the detailed schedule to carry out the financial rehabilita-
tion of these agencies; (4) recruitment of the technical assistance neces-
sary to design and set-up the new standardized accounting system of Ivorian
public enterprises, and to strengthen the financial management of SODEPALM
and SATMACI; and (5) signing of Subsidiary Grant Agreements between the
Government and the participating agencies. Other major actions agreed to
be taken during Project implementation include: (1) SATMACI's and
SODEPALM's field staff would receive an allowance for the purchase,
maintenance and operating costs of their mopeds as well as a daily
subsistence allowance when on field duty; (2) SATMACI and SODEPALM would
recruit before December 31, 1986 the technical assistance necessary to
carry out the technical and managerial skill gap analysis of its middle and
higher management; the study's findings would be discussed with the Bank
and its recommendations implemented; (3) Extension agencies' approved
annual investment and operating budgets would be allocated through (i) a
first tranche representing four months of approved budgets, available as of
January 31 of each year at the latest; (ii) successive tranches thereafter
upon submission of the required statements of expenditures; and (4)
Government would carry out, jointly with the agencies and the Bank, a
mid-term review of the project before June 30, 1988.
7.        Justification.  Economic benefits under the proposed Project
would stem from (a) increased agricultural productivity and production; and
(b) improved efficiency and cost effectiveness of Cate d'Ivoire's three
main rural development agencies. It is expected that by the end of project
implementation, about 50 percent of Ivorian farmers would benefit directly
from improved extension advice and therefore be able to improve their
productivity and incomes. Most of the remaining farmers would also in-
directly benefit from the project through demonstration/diffusion effects.
Increases in agricultural production, in particular in coffee and cocoa,
Cote d'Ivoire's main export crops, would generate important additional
revenues for the Government and ease the current budgetary constraints.
The reorganization of the three rural development agencies' field extension
services and improved planning, budgeting and monitoring systems would
decrease the per-hectare cost of providing extension services.
8.        Risks.  Possible risks would be (a) slower than anticipated
improvement in the management of participating agencies; (b) inadequate
local funding for the implementing agencies' operations; and (c) lower than
expected adoption rates by farmers of recommended cultural practices.
Specific measures would be taken under the project to minimize these risks.



-4-
At field level, the T&V System provides an effective mechanism to plan and
monitor extension agents' activities and to take corrective actions as
needed. A comprehensive staff training and redeployment program would
increase the participating agencies' middle and higher management effec-
tiveness and motivation. Also, improved budgeting and accounting systems
and strengthened financial management would improve resource planning, cost
effectiveness and accountability for the agencies' operations. Government
agreed under the Third Structural Adjustment Loan to provide full funding
for the implementing agencies' annual operations and complementary measures
taken under the project would introduce an effective mechanism for timely
disbursement  of  their  approved annual budgets.   Finally,  project
incremental adoption rates have been set at conservative levels and
extended technologies would be simple, well tested and well suited to
farmers' needs and constraints. With Government committed to provide a
favorable price and incentive environment, the risk of adoption rates
falling short of expected levels is minimal.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
