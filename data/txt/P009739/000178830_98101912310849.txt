THIRD TROMBAY THERMAL POWER PROJECT
I. THE POWER SECTOR
Background
1.01      Power shortages which have been a constant feature in India during
the 1970s are a constraint on the economies of several of the States, partic-
ularly Maharashtra, which has suffered from power cuts of up to 30%. This is
likely to be a continuing problem for some years which, hopefully, will be
progressively alleviated as the large new Central thermal generating stations
come on stream to augment the States generation development programs and as a
national interconnected transmission system, which will optimize generating
facilities, comes into operation. The 500 MW Trombay development, which is the
subject of this report, is needed to augment the Maharashtra State generation
development program and help alleviate power shortages in the State.
Previous Bank Involvement in the Power Sector
1.02      The Bank has made seven loans to India for power projects amounting
to US$179.5 million and IDA nine credits totalling US$596 million. US$315.5
million financed, or is financing, the construction of generating plant, US$23
million financed the purchase of construction equipment for the Beas hydro-
electric project, US$380 million was for high voltage transmission and US$57
million was for rural electrification. All the loans and credits for the
generating plant (excluding the Singrauli Thermal power project (Credit 685-
IN)), the Beas project (Credit 89-IN) and the first and second transmission
projects (Loan 416-IN and Credit 242-IN) have been fully disbursed. The
Singrauli project is still in the preliminary implementation stage and no
disbursements have yet been made. In the case of the Rural Electrification
project (Credit 572-IN) disbursements to February 28, 1978 were US$10.3 mil-
lion. Of the finance made available for the third and fourth transmission
projects (Credit 377-IN of May 1973 - US$85 million and Credit 604-IN of
January 1976 - US$150 million), funds have been fully committed in the case
of Credit 377-IN and in the case of Credit 604-IN approximately US$44 million
had been committed by December 31, 1977 in respect of contracts awarded or
under issue.
1.03      The ongoing power transmission projects and the rural electrifica-
tion project are proceeding satisfactorily notwithstanding delays in initial
implementation and in preparation of specifications for the more sophisticated
load despatch equipment. The Singrauli thermal power project, which is in the
early implementation stage, is also proceeding satisfactorily. The issue of
invitations to tender for the major items of plant and equipment is currently
in hand.
1.04      With regard to previous Bank involvement in financing the Trombay
thermal power station, a Bank loan of US$16.2 million (Loan 106-IN) was made



- 2 -
in November 1954 to the Tata Electric Companies (TEC) to finance the construc-
tion of a 125 MW thermal power station comprising two 62.5 MW generating units,
boilers and ancillary plant together with transmission facilities. A second
Bank loan of US$9.8 million (Loan 164-IN) was made in May 1957 to finance a
third 62.5 MW generating unit and associated plant.
Energy Resources
1.05      India's main commercial energy resources are coal, oil and natural
gas and hydropower. There are also resources of nuclear fuels, principally
uranium and thorium, and India's power program includes the construction of
further "CANDU" type heavy water reactors using domestically produced natural
uranium as fuel. Two nuclear power stations have been constructed to date
and a third is under construction. There are also some geothermal energy
sites, but the potential appears to be limited.
1.06      Coal is by far the most extensive indigenous fossil fuel; reserves
are estimated at 83 billion tons, of which some 21 billion tons have been
proven. Additionally, total reserves of lignite at the Neyveli field in Tamil
Nadu are estimated at around 2 billion tons. If generally unworkable coal,
e.g. coal with high ash and moisture content, is excluded, this estimate of
recoverable and saleable coal and lignite is reduced to something like 24 bil-
lion tons which, on a forecast country-wide usage, would be adequate for some
50 years on current assumptions of economic growth.
1.07      By comparison with coal, proven reserves of oil in India are pre-
sently small. Exploratory and drilling activities to date have proven an
estimated 230 million tons on shore and recent major new off-shore strikes
west of Bombay in the Arabian Sea have led to delineation of fields with
proven recoverable reserves of about 250 million tons of crude oil and 30
billion cubic meters of natural gas. Other reserves of natural gas, which is
found in India both alone and in association with crude oil, are estimated at
over 100 billion cubic meters.
1.08      The firm power potential of hydro-electric power reserves is esti-
mated at 41,000 MW which, at a load factor of 60%, is equivalent to an annual
output of 216 TWh, of which some 8,000 MW will have been developed by March
1979. Some 30% is in the North Eastern Region with the balance spread over
the Northern (25%), Southern (20%), Western (18%) and Eastern (7%) regions.
1.09      Oil and natural gas have important alternative uses and it is
improbable they will be a significant factor in the generation of power.
Development of generating facilities for the foreseeable future, therefore,
will be based on coal or lignite burning thermal stations and hydro-electric
power stations with a small but gradually developing nuclear program.
The Indian Power Sector
1.10      The manner in which the electricity supply industry is at present
organized was broadly determined by the provisions of the Electricity (Supply)
Act, 1948. In particular, the Act provided for the establishment of what
are now the principal agencies in the industry, the State Electricity Boards



-3 -
(SEBs) including the Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking. The SEBs were
assigned responsibility for the generation, transmission and distribution of
electricity within each State, and for the control and regulation of other
supply undertakings which were private licensees. This responsibility includes
the construction of new power stations and the operation and extension of the
systems within each State. Private licensees operate mostly in urban areas
and their relative importance in the sector is expected to diminish over time.
At present, the SEBs effectively own or control the sources of well over 90%
of electricity supply by utilities; in addition, their sanction is required
for the installation of all captive plants within their borders.
1.11      As originally conceived, the SEBs were to be autonomous public
corporations, responsible for running their own operations subject only to
broad instructions and guidance in policy matters from State Governments.
In practice, the SEBs have been very much under the control of the State
Governments, rather along the lines of the Public Works Departments in which
most of them have their origins.
1.12      The Indian power sector is complex because electricity supply is
within the concurrent jurisdiction of the Central Government and the State
Governments, according to the Constitution and to the Electricity (Supply)
Act, 1948. Thus, while the Act assigned extensive responsibilities to the
State authorities, it also provided for broad guidance and coordination from
the Center. These were to be supplied by a Central Electricity Authority
(CEA), which was to be responsible for developing a national policy for power
development and for coordinating the activities of the various planning agen-
cies involved in electricity supply.
1.13      The CEA was formally created in 1950.  At that time it came under
the Power Wing of the Central Water and Power Commission (CWPC) which in
turn was under the Ministry of Irrigation and Power. As a result of admin-
istrative changes introduced in October 1974, responsibility for power was
transferred to the Ministry of Energy, which was created at that time to bring
together ministerial responsibility for coal and power. This involved the
transfer of the Power Wing of the former CWPC to CEA, which now comes under
the Department of Power of the Ministry of Energy. For atomic energy, and
hence for nuclear power generation, there was, and remains, a separate Depart-
ment of Atomic Energy which comes directly under the Prime Minister.
1.14      The Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 has been suitably amended to
enlarge the scope and the functions of the CEA. In addition to its general
duty of developing a sound, adequate and uniform national power policy and
coordinating the activities of the planning agencies in relation to the con-
trol and utilization of national power resources, new functions have been
assigned to it, e.g. formulation of short-term and perspective plans for
power development, training of personnel, interconnected system operations
and research and development.
1.15      Other agencies at the Center are also concerned in the decisions
relating to the planning and financing of electric power. In particular, the
Ministry of Finance and the Planning Commission are involved in the appraisal



- 4 -
and sanction of major power projects and in the financial provisions for
investment in electricity supply.
1.16      In view of the immense task of providing sufficient generating
capacity to meet the requirements of the Indian economy through the 1980s,
the Government of India (GOI) is supplementing the efforts of the States by
constructing a number of large generating stations. For this purpose, two
Central generating companies, one for hydro and the other for thermal plant,
have been establised. These have been registered under the Companies Act and
are accountable to the GOI through the Ministry of Energy for the construc-
tion, ownership and operation of large-Central thermal and hydro generating
facilities which will provide bulk power to neighboring States. Power will
be transferred over an interconnected 400 kV transmission system. It is
believed that these new large facilities will help to speed attainment of
meaningful regional integrated operation. Also likely to help accelerate
the integration of regional operations is a US$1.6 million equivalent UNDP-
assisted project designed to help the CEA establish a system operations
organization capable of meeting the future coordination and control needs of
the Indian electricity supply system, and to provide modern training in the
field of load despatching.
1.17      As a means of improving collaboration between the SEBs and estab-
lishing power systems on a regional rather than a State basis, five Regional
Electricity Boards were formed during the period 1964-66. The general func-
tions of the Boards are to review the progress of regional power development
schemes, plan the integrated operation of the constituent power systems for
the maximum benefit of the regions as a whole, coordinate overhaul and main-
tenance programs, determine generation schedules to be followed and the power
available from time to time for transfer between States and determine a suit-
able tariff structure to govern exchanges of power within the region. The
ultimate aim is the establishment of a national power system with a central
system operations organization, under the direction of which the Regional
Boards would operate. The technical, commercial and economic policies for
the operation of the future national power system are matters which are still
to be decided. GOI is obtaining advice in these matters but it is certain
that the rapid expansion envisaged will involve further strengthening of CEA
to meet its expanding responsibilities in the power sector. These matters
are dealt with more fully in the Staff Appraisal Report No. 17336-IN for the
Korba Thermal Power Project.
Maharashtra State Power Sector
1.18      Prior to 1954 the more populous areas of Maharashtra State were
supplied by private electricity undertakings operating under license. The
Bombay State Electricity Board, which was formed in 1954, took over supplies
in Gujarat and part of Bombay. In 1956 the Bombay SEB area was extended to
include parts of Madhya Pradesh, Hyderabad and Kutch; then in 1960 the Board
was split in two to form the Gujarat State Electricity Board (GSEB) and the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). During this time the individual
private electricity undertakings were gradually taken over and the principal
undertakings now left in Maharashtra are:



- 5 -
(a)  Tata Electric Companies (TEC);
(b)  Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Undertaking (BSES);
(c)  Bombay Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking
(BEST); and
(d)  Thana Electric Supply Company (TESCO).
There are a few other small areas in Maharashtra State served by private dis-
tribution companies but these will be taken over by MSEB as their licenses
expire. Generating facilities in the State are operated by MSEB and TEC.
Operation of the Power Sector
1.19      The major licensees described above operate within their concession
areas and MSEB generates and distributes electricity throughout the rest of
Maharashtra State. With the exception of TEC, the licensees are all dis-
tribution authorities and buy power in bulk from MSEB and TEC. TEC, which
is by far the largest licensee and operates generating plant with an aggre-
gate installed capacity of 622 MW, is unable to meet the demand on its system
and purchases up to 500 MW of additional power from MSEB. The power is pur-
chased at three points: Trombay, Kalwa and Borivli.
1.20      TEC supplies energy in bulk to textile mills and other large indus-
tries, distributing licensees and local authorities in Bombay and surrounding
areas. It also supplies power within the areas of other licensees and MSEB
to individual consumers whose demands exceed the limits specified below,
where these are within TEC's overall licensed areas of supply. Map IBRD 13117
illustrates the areas of supply of the licensees listed in paragraph 1.18.
TEC also supplies about 60 MW of power to the Indian Railways system.
Licensee                Limit of Supply
BSES            All consumers up to 1,000 kVa
BEST            All consumers up to 250 kVa
TESCO           All consumers up to 300 kVa
MSEB            All consumers up to 5,000 kVa
1.21      The Indian Railways system is interconnected with the TEC system
at Kalijan. Chola, which is an old, inefficient power station owned by Indian
Railways and which has an effective capacity of 40 MW, provides about 25 MW
to the Railways and the balance of 15 MW is sold to a group of consumers who,
in the light of current power restrictions, are prepared to pay the higher
prices for Chola power, which is wheeled over the Tata system. Charges are
collected by the Mill Owners' Association (consumers are mainly textile
manufacturers) and passed to Indian Railways via TEC which applies a "wheeling
charge" of 6%.
1.22      The TEC system is solidly interconnected with the MSEB system, which
in turn is interconnected with the Gujarat system and, via a weak interconnec-
tion, with the Madhya Pradesh system. Future planning provides for all three
State systems to be interconnected at 400 kV. TEC operates a load despatch



- 6-
center at Trombay which is equipped with the latest technological developments.
MSEB operates load despatch centers at Kalwa and Ambasari which presently
function on a telephone communication basis, but these are being equipped with
more sophisticated equipment and reconstruction should be completed by early
1978. The regional load despatch center which will be part of the national
system will ultimately be established in Bombay. Equipment for these load
despatch centers is currently on order.
1.23      The connection of new consumers with a demand of up to 1,000 kW is
within the authority of the State. The licensing of large industry is within
the authority of the Central Government, from whom authority must be obtained
for the provision of supplies to new consumers with a demand exceeding 1,000
kW.
Existing Facilities
1.24      MSEB's and TEC's existing generating facilities are shown in Table
1.1 below. As of March 31, 1977, MSEB had twelve power stations (five hydro
and seven thermal) with a total installed capacity of 1,879 K1W including
Koyna and other hydro power stations leased to the Board by the State Gov-
ernment for operation and maintenance. TEC has four power stations (three
hydro and one thermal) with a total installed capacity of 622 MW. Addition-
ally, there is the Tarapur nuclear power station with a capacity of 400 MW,
which is shared by MSEB and GSEB, and Chola (40 MW) which is connected to the
TEC system (see paragraph 1.21).

1.25      The total length of medium and high voltage transmission lines and
underground cable (11 kV and above) operated by MSEB at March 31, 1977 was
about 80,000 circuit km, and by TEC about 2,200 circuit km. The aggregate
capacity of transformers of 11 kV and above operated by MSEB was around 7,500



MVA and by TEC was about 3,500 MVA. The TEC system, which comprises 110 kV,
132 kV and 220 kV transmission lines, is tied in with MSEB's 220 kV network
at three points with an aggregate stepdown capacity of 1,250 MVA comprising
ten auto transformers each of 125 MVA. The supply is generally reliable but
losses and power unaccounted for on the MSEB system at around 25% of units
sent out (excluding bulk sales to licensees) are high. Losses in the TEC
system at around 3% are low, but the two figures are not comparable because
TEC provides high tension supplies only to 214 consumers, while MSEB supplies
mainly at low tension to over two million consumers.
Future Development
1.26      The overall strategy of the State Government for development of the
sector is to eliminate restrictions (see para. 3.06) by the end of the 1970s.
To meet this target an installed capacity of 4,730 MW would have been required
by the end of 1978/79 and the Board's program of development envisaged a pro-
gram of expenditure of about US$1.5 billion. However, these proposals were
drastically curtailed and expenditures for the period 1974/75 through 1978/79
were subsequently fixed at about US$610 million equivalent. This has resulted
in a reduced target for extending the generating plant and transmission
system. Installed capacity by 1978/79 is unlikely to exceed 3,600 MW and
load restrictions will likely continue into the early 1980s.
1.27      Major developments now under implementation or approved are
described below:
Generation
(a) The Koradi power station which presently comprises 480 MW
is being extended with a further three 210 MW units, the
first of which was scheduled to go into commercial opera-
tion by January 1978 and the last by June 1981;
(b) Nasik power station (presently 280 MW) is being extended
with a further two 210 MW units;
(c) Bhusawal power station (presently 62.5 MW) is being extended
with a further 210 MW unit;
(d) Gas turbine plant aggregating 240 MW is scheduled near Bombay
with commissioning due by the end of 1978;
(e) The hydro power station at Koyna (presently 540 MW) is
being augmented with another station comprising four 80 MW
units which will use the tailrace waters. Construction
of this power station, which will be peaking only, is
well advanced; and
(f) Trombay Power Station which belongs to TEC is being ex-
tended (actually another installation in proximity to the
the existing) with the 500 MW unit constituting the Project,
feeding directly into the existing 220 kV network.



-8-
Transmission
(a) MSEB is constructing 750 km of double circuit 400 kV line
from Koradi to Bhusawal and Kalwa (Bombay), principally for
the transfer of power from the Koradi area. Work on this
line has started and substantial progress has been made.
The section to Bhusawal is expected to be completed by mid
1978 and to Kalwa by January 1980. Initially it will be
energized at 220 kV; and
(b) Other major transmission extensions are being financed
under IDA Credit 604-IN.
1.28      The above generation developments, together with other currently
approved generation developments which are scheduled for commissioning by
1983/84, are shown in Table 1.2 below. These are, in aggregate, insufficient
to meet the capacity shortfall during this period and, unless further develop-
ments are approved, power restrictions will continue into the late 1980s. The
projected situation is illustrated in the chart at Annex I which shows the
forecast increase in capacity and the capacity which will be required to meet
the peak demand through 1983/84.

Rural Electrification
1.30      Maharashtra is one of the more progressive States in the promotion
of rural electrifization. During the 1970s an average of some 1,500 villages
and 44,000 irrigation pumpsets/tubewells have been energized every year.
There are just over 26,000 towns and villages in the State and the number
of these electrified had increased from 853 in 1961 to just over 20,000 by
1976. The Project which will provide another 500 MW of power for the
Maharashtra system, will contribute to the continuing program of rural
electrification.
II. THE BORROWER - THE TATA ELECTRIC COMPANIES
2.01      The Borrower of the proposed Bank loan would be TEC and GOI would
be the Guarantor.
2.02      TEC consist of three Companies:
(a)  the Tata Hydroelectric Power Supply Company Limited,
formed in 1910;
(b)  the Andhra Valley Power Supply Company Limited, formed
in 1916; and
(c)  the Tata Power Company Limited, formed in 1919.
These Companies are separate publicly owned entities in the private sector but
operate as a group under the same management. They form a part of the Tata
group of enterprises which have substantial financial resources, an excellent
credit rating, first-class managerial ability and a long and successful
history of operations in many industrial and other fields in India.
2.03      The three Tata Companies function as an interconnected grid; the
three hydroelectric power stations are owned by the Companies individually,
and the Trombay thermal power station together with the transmission and sub-
stations are owned jointly in the ratio of 20:30:50 by Tata Hydro, Andhra
Valley and Tata Power, respectively.



- 10 -
2.04      Each of the three Tata Companies operates under individual licenses,
(Bombay Hydro Electric License 1907, the Andhra Valley Hydro Electric License
1919 and the Nila Mula Valley Hydro Electric License 1921) and the Trombay
Thermal Power Electric License 1953 is granted jointly to all three. MSEB
has the option to purchase the undertakings covered by the licenses, and the
earliest date on which the option to purchase can be exercised is June 30,
1980.
2.05      TEC's licenses have been the subject of a series of meetings between
TEC, MSEB and the Government of Maharashtra (GOM) during 1977 and a satisfac-
tory settlement of the whole question of license extension and rationalization
of distribution facilities was reached in principle, in September 1977. This
settlement, which has still to be formalized, provides for an extension of
TEC's licenses and franchise for a period coterminous with the last repayment
against the proposed Bank loan, contingent upon meeting under Phase I of the
settlement (i) specified requirements regarding rationalization of distribu-
tion, and (ii) specified pollution requirements in respect of the Project and
existing Trombay plant. The agreement with regard to rationalization of
distribution does not affect TEC's financial operations sirce they will still
sell power to MSEB in the areas taken over. With regard to pollution require-
ments TEC intends to carry out a study of pollution control at the Trombay
complex to determine the actions which need to be taken. Under Phase II of
the settlement, TEC and MSEB have agreed to commence discussions on July 1,
1984 to arrive at a mutually acceptable agreement for further delimitation,
with effect from July 1, 1985, of TEC's licensed area, the guiding principle
being that TEC would be allowed to retain such distribution rights and loads
in their area as warranted by their surplus generating capacity. This matter
was discussed during negotiations and GOI agreed to take all steps necessary
to secure undertakings from the State of Maharashtra that no action, including
delimiting TEC's area of supply, would be taken which would interfere with
TEC's performance or adversely affect its financial position. The formal
extension of TEC's licenses is a condition of disbursement of the proposed
loan.
Security Arrangements
2.06      Annex 2 shows existing liens on TEC's property as at March 31, 1977.
Outstanding debentures are secured by a concurrent first mortgage and first
charge on immovable properties, plant and licenses of TEC and a floating
charge on all its other assets subject to prior first mortgage charge and
floating charge in favor of the US Agency for International Development, and
until recently of IBRD, in respect of TEC's holdings under the Trombay Thermal
License. The first two Bank loans have now been paid up and this security,
as far as the Bank is concerned, has now lapsed. TEL has agreed, as security
for the proposed loan, (i) a first specific mortgage on the properties pro-
vided under the Project and those subsequently added, pari passu with the
Indian financial institutions in respect of their share of co-financing;
(ii) a first floating charge on all existing immovable and movable assets
held under the Trombay Thermal License pari passu with other lenders and
(iii) assignment to the Bank by way of mortgage of the Trombay License in-
cluding extensions and/or renewals thereof. Completion of these security
arrangements is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan.

Organization and Management
2.07      TEC's organization is shown in Annex 3.  The three Tata Companies
are well managed utilities and are operated in accordance with sound commer-
cial principles. Each Company has a separate Board of Directors and four
officials are common to each Board: the Chairman, the Managing Director and
two other directors including the Director of Finance. The other members,
are representatives of leading industrial and banking interests in India.
There is one State Government member on each Board. The technical and man-
agerial services of the Companies have been integrated into one common system.
2.08      The staff of the Companies numbered 2,645 on July 31, 1977, of
whom 50 are senior management, 100 are senior engineers, 570 are assistant
engineers, operators/technicians, etc. and the balance of 1,925 are skilled
and semi-skilled (1,300) and non-technical/administrative (625). This is
considered reasonable for the operation of TEC's facilities.
2.09      The present management and staff are fully experienced and competent
to operate the Companies efficiently. They are also competent to carry out
the Project with the assistance of consultants (see paragraph 4.09) and to
carry out other works covered by TEC's development program.
Training
2.10      TEC's training program is principally focused on the training of
power plant operators. The rationale for this is that the efficiency and
availability, and indeed the life, of the advanced type of generating plants
which are now being installed, depend to a large extent on the ability of
the operating staff to understand and perform the necessary plant control
operations quickly and in accordance with stipulated sequences during normal
and emergency conditions.
2.11      Training of power plant operators comprises some classroom lectures
on theory and practical in-plant observations but the most important part of
the training is on the analogue simulator, designed and constructed by TEC,
which simulates the 150 MW generating unit at Trombay power station. This
simulator, which will be modified to simulate the 500 MW machine in its dynamic
responses, interlocks and operational sequences, gives the trainee operator
experience in handling abnormalities encountered in the actual operation of
the plant. This facility is being used for training not only TEC's personnel,
but also the thermal station operators of the various SEBs as well as trainees
from the training schools operated by CEA.
2.12      On-the-job training is provided for transmission and distribution
personnel and ample external facilities exist for classroom training of this
category of staff and also for administrative and clerical staff. No train-
ing program for accounting staff is necessary as requirements are normally
met from the large reservoir of locally trained accounting staff.



- 12 -
2.13      TEC has also commissioned a modern digital process computer system
for load control which provides instant-by-instant control of the entire
process of power generation, and the load despatch center is staffed by well.
trained engineers.
2.14      Load despatch centers such as TEC's are now being planned by the
States and Regions as part of the planning for a future national power system.
TEC is planning to introduce training courses for selected SEB engineers to
acquire on-the-job training in load despatch.
2.15      Another area of training in which TEC can play an important role
is the expertise which can be passed on in the design and construction of
a 500 MW installation which is the Project described in Chapter IV of this
Report. This will be the first unit of this size to be installed in India
and, since the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) will be installing
similar units in the second stage of construction of its large Central thermal
power stations, it is important that the Project should be used as far as
possible as a training ground. The conditions laid down by GOI in approving
the 500 MW development included, inter alia, that TEC would provide necessary
information and data on operating experience to CEA as may be required by GOI
and would make available, facilities for training a reasonable number of
persons, selected by GOI, in the construction, operation and maintenance of
the 500 MW unit.
Audit
2.16      The audit of the books of the three Companies which form TEC would
be made by independent auditors appointed by the Companies at their annual
general meetings in accordance with the Companies Act 1956. The auditors
appointed would normally be members of the Indian Institute of Chartered
Accountants and qualified within the meaning of the Chartered Accountants
Act 1949. Messrs. A.F. Ferguson and Co. and Messrs. S.B. Billimoria and Co.
of Bombay were reappointed auditors of the Companies at the Annual General
Meeting in September 1976 to examine and audit the accounts of the Companies
for FY1977. They were again retained for a further year by resolution of the
Annual General Meeting on September 20, 1977. These auditors are acceptable
to the Bank.
III. DEMAND AND MARKET ASPECTS
The Power Market
3.01      When examining the power market in Maharashtra State the combined
TEC and MSEB system must be considered, since all consumers are supplied from
this system. The maximum demand on the interconnected TEC and MSEB system
in 1976/77 was 1,950 MW, and energy sent out and purchased aggregated about
13,200 million GWh. These figures are derived from statistics provided by
TEC and MSEB and there may be inaccuracies due to difficulty in adjusting



- 13 -
for imports and exports of power and cross transfers between TEC and MSEB.
Details of such transfers for 1975/76 (details for 1976/77 were not available
at the time of appraisal) are shown in Table 3.1 below.

- TEC                                     2,692.0
3.02      The total number of consumers connected to the MSEB system at
March 31, 1977 was 2,025,527.  TEC, which supplies large industrial consumers
and other licensees, had 214 consumers at March 31, 1977. The maximum demand
on the TEC system in 1976/77 was about 1,000 MW.  With a total installed capa-
city of only 622 MW, TEC is currently purchasing some 500 MW from MSEB to
meet the demand of its consumers.
3.03      Approximately 28% of all industry in India is concentrated in the
Greater Bombay area and this category of consumer accounts for about 68% of
the demand in Maharashtra State. Industrial demand is developing rapidly with
the local load in the Trombay (port) area of Bombay forecast to increase from
a present demand of 160 MW to around 400 MW by 1980/81 with the establish-
ment of industrial developments including fertilizer, chemical and refining
complexes. Similarly, considerable load growth is expected in the area
between Tarapur and Bombay, which includes growing load centers like Tarapur
Industrial Estates, where about 400 industrial units are expected to be estab-
lished with an aggregate demand rising to 200 MW. Considerable load growth
is also expected in Southern and South Eastern Maharashtra which include
developing load centers such as Poona, Ratnagiri, Kolhapur, Khopoli, etc.
The development of rural electrification is also proceeding rapidly (see
paragraph 1.30).
3.04      Sales of KWh by MSEB, with a breakdown between the different con-
sumer categories for the year 1976/77 and a forecast for the period 1977/78

3.06      The Maharashtra State has had to undergo heavy energy and demand
shortages for the past five years, arising initially from poor monsoons but
during the last three years because of shortage of on-line capacity. The
forecast load growth shown in Tables 3.2 and 3.3 is based on productive capa-
bility of currently planned plant availability and implies a continuation of
the power restrictions, the major brunt of which has been, and still is being,
taken by the industrial consumers. The magnitude of the power cuts is shown
in Table 3.4.
Table 3.4: Magnitude of Power Restrictions 1976/77
Restriction in Maximum       Restriction on
Category of Industry             Demand                    Energy
Essential                          15%                      15%
Textiles                           30%                      25%
Continuous Process                 30%                      30%
General Industries                 40%                      30%
Services Industries                40%                      20%
3.07      Because of these cuts it is estimated that the load and energy
sales for 1976/77 were some 400 MW and 2,000 GWh lower than would have been
the case without restrictions.
IV. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
4.01      Although developed by the private sector, the proposed Trombay 500
MW single unit extension is part of the Maharashtra State generation develop-
ment program which is described in paragraphs 1.26 through 1.29.
The Project
4.02      The Project which comprises a 500 MW single unit installation with
boiler, electrical and mechanical plant including pollution control equipment,
and associated civil works, will be erected on reclaimed land (ash disposal
area) owned by TEC, adjacent to the existing Trombay power station. The
boiler would be designed for triple firing (coal, gas or oil). The infra-
structure facilities (coal, water, transmission) are already available adja-
cent to the site and will be extended to meet the requirements of the Project.
In effect, therefore, the 500 MW unit, although comprising a separate installa-
tion, is an extension of the existing Trombay thermal power station.
4.03      The Project will feed into the Maharashtra State system which is
interconnected with the Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh State systems. The
combined capacity of these three State systems by the time the 500 MW unit
is commissioned (1982) will be about 10,000 MW with an aggregate estimated
peak demand of about 7,500 MW. The unit will then constitute only 5% of the



- 16 -
installed capacity of the combined system (about 10% of the capacity of the
TEC/MSEB system). System stability studies have been carried out under
varying conditions and these demonstrate that the TEC/MSEB system should be
capable of withstanding a disturbance due to tripping of a unit of this size.
4.04       Load flow and transient stability studies of the TEC/MSEB system
with the 500 MW unit in service5have also been carried out for different
operating conditions. These proved the adequacy of the proposed transmission
network to handle the demand under all conditions, even with unit outage.
Estimated Cost
4.05       The estimated cost of the Project as defined in paragraph 4.02 is
Rs 1,800 million (US$209.4 million), excluding interest during construction
estimated at approximately US$40 million equivalent. The foreign currency
component is estimated at Rs 781 million (US$90.8 million). The estimated
costs of the principal features of the Project are shown in Table 4.1 and in
more detail in Annex 4.

4.06      The proposed Bank Loan of US$105 million is equivalent to 50% of the
cost of the Project, excluding interest during construction. This will be
applied to consultants costs and to cif and/or ex-factory costs of all plant
and equipment with the exception of the turbogenerator and specified items of
equipment associated therewith for which Germany through Kreditastalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW) is providing the foreign currency. Civil works, inland
transportation costs and any other costs not financed from the Bank loan
would be financed by debt and equity capital to be raised by TEC.

Basis for Estimates
4.07      The estimated costs of the major components of the Project, the
500 MW generating unit and boiler, are based on information supplied by TEC
and on information obtained by the appraisal mission from Taiwan Power
Company through its consultants, Gibbs and Hill of New York, concerning bids
received in May 1977 for the supply of two 500 MW units and boilers for
Anping steam power station. Costs of associated electrical, mechanical,
anti-pollution and switchyard equipment are based upon estimates received
from overseas manufacturers and Indian manufacturers where such equipment is
manufactured in India and also, where available, upon costs of similar equip-
ment recently purchased for other developments in India. A physical contin-
gency of 10% has been allowed on civil works and 5% has been allowed on all
plant costs. In assessing price contingency, it has been assumed that, based
on recent experience, fixed price contracts will be obtainable for all plant
and equipment with the exception of the sulphur dioxide (SO 2) removal system.
Base 1977 costs for such plant, excluding the SO removal system, plus physical
contingency have been escalated at 7% a year to Sate of placing contract, and
erection costs have been escalated at 7% a year throughout the erection period.
On the assumption that major contracts will be placed by mid-1978 and erection
will be substantially completed by the end of 1981, this gives an overall price
contingency in the neighborhood of 10%. Civil works costs have been escalated
at 7% annually through the construction period. In view of the difficulty in
estimating the cost of the SO2 removal system until the consultants recommen-
dations are available (see paragraph 4.17(a)), a flat price contingency of 25%
has been allowed.
4.08      The breakdown between foreign and local costs assumes that the
500 MW turbo-generator and the high pressure parts of the boiler will be
procured overseas with most of the contracts for the other components of
the Project being won by Indian suppliers under international competitive
bidding procedures.
Engineering and Construction
4.09      During negotiations TEC agreed to employ engineering consultants
whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment
would be satisfactory to the Bank. The Project is being engineered by Tata
Consulting Engineers (TCE) and TEC has also engaged a firm of consultants
(Ebasco Services of the USA) who are experienced in 500 MW design to assist
TCE in the more sophisticated areas such as instrumentation and controls and
to review TCE's specifications and designs as required by TEC and the Bank.
TCE and Ebasco Services are satisfactory to the Bank. TEC also agreed to
employ an experienced consultant satisfactory to the Bank to carry out a study
to determine the measures, if any, which might be necessary to remove SO2
from the stack gases at Trombay power station to meet environmental quallty
standards (see paragraph 4.17(a)).



- 18 -
4.10      Preliminary design work is already in hand and soil tests have
been carried out at the proposed site to establish bearing capacity and
foundation levels. A number of preliminary studies have been made relative
to the cooling water intake and discharge systems, substructure and super-
structure, chimney, plant and boiler foundations and extensions to the
existing infrastructure. Because of the urgent need for the additional
capacity, TEC proposes to proceed immediately with preparation of specifi-
cations and tender documents for the main plant, with a view to award of
contracts by June/July 1978; in the meantime preliminary works will be
carried out. Preparation of specifications for civil works will be completed
as soon as the information relative to foundation design can be provided by
the successful plant contractors and it is hoped the main civil works contract
will be placed by late 1978. The implementation and construction schedule
shown in Annex 5 indicates a period of five years from commencing preparation
of specifications to putting the 500 MW unit into commercial operation. On
this basis the unit is scheduled to go into commercial operation by December
1982. This timetable is reasonable.
4.11      The source of supply of fresh water for the existing Trombay thermal
power station is the Bombay Municipal Corporation, which has confirmed that it
will be in a position to meet the enhanced demand when the 500 MW unit is
commissioned.
4.12      The estimated annual coal requirement of the 500 MW unit is 1.35
million tonnes. Trombay is presently receiving coal at the rate of about
0.54 million tonnes annually which indicates total annual requirements of
just under two million tonnes when the Project is commissioned. At present
coal is transferred by rail from Central India coal fields. The Indian
Railways have confirmed that they are in a position to step up coal deliveries
to Trombay and it was confirmed during negotiations that coal for Trombay
would continue to be supplied from Central India coal fields. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that GOI will take all necessary steps to ensure
adequate coal and rail transportation facilities to supply two million tonnes
per annum for Trombay power station by the time the Project is completed.
Procurement
4.13      Procurement of all equipment to be financed from the proposed Bank
loan would be on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines. All bidding documents, including recommendations
for award of contracts, would be prepared by TEC with the assistance of its
cons&ltants and approved by the Bank. Local manufacturers are expected to bid
for )all categories of equipment. A domestic preference of 15% or the import
duty, whichever is less, would be applied in bid evaluation. Local manufac-
turers are likely to win the majority of contract awards, but to prevent
procurement delays assurances were obtained from GOI during negotiations that,
in the event the lowest evaluated bidder for any contract is a foreign manu-
facturer, permission to import will be forthcoming without further review by
any agency of the Government. In the case of minor items of equipment not
exceeding US$100,000 equivalent, contracts may be awarded, where appropriate,
on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally.



- 19 -
4.14      The turbo-generator will be procured from Kraftwerk Union of
Germany, the firm with which the Indian manufacturer, Bharat Heavy
Electricals Limited has recently concluded a cooperation agreement for the
ultimate construction of large generating units in India. There are competent
local contracting firms in India and manufacturing facilities covering most of
the remaining equipment for the Project, and work not financed wholly or in
part from the Bank loan would be subject to local procurement procedures which
are satisfactory.
Disbursements
4.15      Disbursements would be made against the cost of consultants retained
to assist in the design of the Project and against the cost of the plant and
equipment, excluding items earmarked for financing under the KfW loan, on the
following basis.
(a) 100% of the ex-factory cost of equipment procured in
India after international competitive bidding; and
(b) the c.i.f. cost of equipment procured abroad.
4.16      Because of the need to expedite work if the target date for com-
pleting the Project (December 1982) is to be met, consultants expenditures
of about US$0.25 million equivalent will be incurred prior to signing the
Loan Agreement. These costs have been included in the cost estimates and
will be eligible for disbursement under the Bank loan. Any balance of the
loan not used after commitments have been made for plant, equipment and con-
sultants costs may be used to finance plant and equipment erection contracts
other than for the turbo-generator. The estimated schedule of disbursements
is shown in Table 4.2.

Ecological Aspects
4.17      TEC agreed during negotiations to take all necessary steps in the
design, construction and operation of the Project to ensure compliance with
the environmental quality standards prescribed by the relevant national, state
and local authorities. The actions presently proposed to deal with the
principal environmental problems are described below.
(a)  Location and Air Pollution
The location is in an industrial area on the outskirts of Bombay
on coastal reclaimed land adjacent to the existing Trombay power station.
There are no residential properties in the near vicinity and no resettlement
problems are involved. Prevailing winds are usually offshore. The 500 MW
unit will be equippped with an electrostatic precipitator with an efficiency
of 99.5% and a stack which will be designed for a height of 500 feet to ensure
greater dispersion of pollutants and particulate matter. Space is being left
for the installation, if necessary, of an SO2 removal system to remove sulphur
dioxide from the stack gases. Such systems are usually considered for instal-
lation in power stations burning coal containing 3% or more sulphur, and they
are designed to remove up to 80% of the sulphur dioxide from the stack gases;
this is equivalent to burning coal with around 0.7% sulphur without an SO re-
moval system. The Singrauli coal which is being used in Trombay has a suiphur
content of 0.3-0.6%. Thus, the emission level is not likely to provide an
environmental hazard. Nevertheless, provision has been included in the
Project, at the specific request of the Maharashtra State Government, for the



- 21 -
installation of an SO2 removal system. The installation of this system
should be contingent upon the findings of a study which should be carried
out to determine the measures, if any, which might be necessary to remove
So2 from the stack gases in order to meet environmental quality standards
(see paragraphs 2.05 and 4.09).
(b) Water Pollution
Hot water from the condenser will be discharged 3into the sea. The
water discharge is estimated to be approximately 60,000 m /hr of hot water
100 C above the intake temperature. -The flood and ebb currents will assist
in dissipating the rejected heat and with such a large dilution factor no
significant effect is likely on marine life.
(c) Noise Control
The plant and equipment will be designed to ensure the noise level
will be below 90 decibels, which is well under the maximum accepted threshold
for a normal 8 hour day for shift workers.
(d) Ash Disposal
The estimated quantity of ash to be disposed of from the proposed
500 MW unit is about 472,000 tonnes per year; another 175,000 tonnes comes
from the existing units. Adequate low lying areas (mud-flats) are available
for this purpose approximately 3 km away from the power station, along the
coast line. These areas, which can be reclaimed for beneficial use, provide
an average depth fill of about 3 meters and would be adequate for about 23
years of plant life. Ash storage dykes and skimmer arrangements are proposed
to ensure no ash carryover to the sea.
4.18      With regard to the safety and occupational health of employees,
safety regulations for power stations, to which all operating personnel
must conform, will be strictly enforced.
Completion Report
4.19      In order to inform the Bank and the Borrower about the performance
of the Project, and the lessons learned during its execution, a completion
report is required following the closing date of the loan. TEC has agreed
not later than six months after the closing date, or such later date as may
be agreed for this purpose between the Borrower and the Bank, to prepare
and furnish to the Bank a report, of such scope and in such detail as the
Bank shall reasonably request, on the execution and initial operation of the
Project, its cost and impact, the performance by the Borrower and the Bank of
their respective obligations under the Loan Agreement and the accomplishment
of the purposes of the loan.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
5.01      TEC has a successful financial record within the limitations of
the licences and regulations under which the three companies operate. They
have consistently earned profits, and dividends have been paid regularly on
all share capital.
5.02      The three Companies together would be the borrower of the loan.
For this reason, the financial statements (Annexes 6-10) have been prepared
by consolidating the working results of the three Tata Companies from FY1973
through FY1977. Future forecasts through FY1985 have been made on a consoli-
dated basis. Annex 11 details the assumptions used. Accounts of the three
companies are audited regularly by independent auditors. During negotiations
TEC agreed to submit, within six months of the close of each financial year,
audited accounts for each of the three Companies.
5.03      TEC's earnings are regulated by the Sixth and Seventh Schedules of
the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948.   The Sixth Schedule provides, among other
things, that "the licensee shall so adjust his charges for the sale of
electricity, whether by enhancing or reducing them, that his "clear profit"
in any year shall not, as far as possible, exceed the amount of reasonable
return". "Clear profit" represents the income from the sale of energy,
rentals and other utility receipts, less admissible expenses, i.e. operating
expenses, interest on money borrowed, income tax, certain appropriations to
statutory reserves, and other special appropriations permitted by the State
Government. "The amount of reasonable return" is defined as the sum of
(a) 7% of that part of the capital base equal to the capital base as on
March 31, 1965, (b) a percentage on the balance of the capital base equal
to 2% over the Reserve Bank Rate ruling at the beginning of the year (cur-
rently 9%), and (c) additional sums equal to one half of 1% on capital
borrowed (i) from institutions approved by the State Government and (ii) by
the issue of debentures. The forecast clear profit statement (Annex 9) sets
out the admissible expenses which, together with a margin for clear profit,
form the basis for determining the average sale price of power each year.
In the event TEC would earn clear profit in excess of the amount of reason-
able return for the year, provision is made in the Act for its disposal. The
forecast clear profit estimated for FY1977 and FY1978 as shown in Annex 9 is
greater than the reasonable return, but in subsequent years clear profit
margin and amount of reasonable return are assumed to be equal. The items
which make up the capital base each year from FY1977 through FY1985 are set
out in Annex 10.
5.04      An upward adjustment of charges may be made only after the expiry
of a notice in writing of no less than 60 clear days given to the State
Government and to the MSEB. However, tariff increases are not allowed more
than once in any financial year.



- 23 -
Earnings
5.05      TEC's combined financial operations for each of the five years
FY1973 to FY1977, together with forecasts for subsequent years to FY1985
are set out in Annex 6. The main points which emerge from examination of
the financial operations to FY1977 are:
(a)  sales stagnated during the first four years FY1973 -
FY1976, due to power restrictions (see paragraphs 3.06
and 3.07) followed by an 11% increase in the fifth year
FY1977;
(b)  the average selling price of energy increased at an
annual rate of 25% from 8.8 paise/kWh in FY1973 to
21.2 paise/kWh in FY1977 to meet rising costs of
operation. These included increases in unit costs
at annual rates of:
(i)  42% for fuel for generation from 4.9 paise/kWh
to 19.6 paise/kWh;
(ii)  24% for energy purchased by TEC from the MSEB,
from 7.45 paise to 17.9 paise/kWh;
(iii)  15% for other operations and maintenance from
1.4 paise to 2.4 paise/kWh; and
(c) annual revenues have been sufficient each year to meet
all operating expenses and interest, provide for taxes
and statutory reserves, and pay dividends.
5.06      Forecast earnings during the period FY1978 through FY1985 cover
the six-year period of construction of the Project to FY1983 together with
an additional two years to FY1985. The new power generating station would
reach its full commercial operation in FY1985.
5.07      TEC's average selling price of power would rise from 21.23 paise
per kWh (US 2.47 cents equivalent) in FY1977 to 25.79 paise per kWh (US 3.00
cents) by FY1982 before falling to 23.34 paise per kWh (US 2.71 cents) by
FY1985. The forecast price rise is attributable mainly to the inclusion of
interest during construction as an expense when assessing tariffs.
5.08      TEC's operating income (Annex 6) based on the admissible expenses
and a margin for clear profit (Annex 9), is normally insufficient to meet
current interest and dividends, and any shortfall is covered by TEC's non-
operating income. If TEC's performance were measured by expressing net
operating income (before interest) as a rate of return on a capital base of
average net fixed assets in service, as used in covenants with other Bank
Group borrowers, the company's forecast rates of return would be 15.7% in
FY1978 rising to 49% in FY1982 before falling to a little below 13% in 1984



- 24 -
and 1985. These rates of return are overstated partly because the assets
which form the rate base are recorded at historic costs, and partly because
interest on loans during the construction of the plant is a permissible
expense which will be taken into account in the calculation of the tariffs
each year. Even so, the average wholesale price of energy would only be
US$0.03 per kWh. In view of the method of regulation of TEC's finances by
the Sixth Schedule of the Electricity (Supply) Act, a rate of return earnings
covenant would not be appropriate and has not been sought for the purposes of
this project.
5.09      With the additional tariff referred to in para. 5.07 TEC's
operating ratio, which was 87% during each of the 4 years through FY76,
would rise to 94% in FY1978 before reducing gradually to 82% in FY1984.
5.10      Annex 7 shows that TEC's capital expenditure (including the cost of
the project) would be Rs 1,984.0 million during the six years FY1978-1983.
A reasonably firm financing plan submitted by TEC, which appears below (Table
5.1), was accepted during negotiations.

TEC's financing plan covers its investment program for the six years FY1978 -
FY1983, and provides Rs 1,800 million (US$209.4 million) for the project and
Rs 184 million (US$21.3 million) for other investment. The plan shows that

internal cash generation would provide funds only equal to 3% of the total
investment. However, since interest during construction, estimated at
Rs 340 million (US$40 million), would not be capitalized, tariffs would be
suitably adjusted each year to meet this interest liability. The proportion
of the investment which would be financed from revenue during the project
construction period would thus be raised effectively from 3% to 17%. This
would be satisfactory.
5.11      Capital to finance the project costing Rs 1,800 million would
come from the proposed Bank loan (Rs 903 million), local financing institu-
tions (Rs 550 million) Maharashtra Government/and Consumers Security Deposits
(Rs 172 million) and Equity share capital (Rs 175 million).
5.12      The proposed Bank loan with a maturity of 20 years (including a
grace period of five years) would be repayable in equal half-yearly install-
ments of principal together with interest assumed at the Bank's standard
interest rate on outstanding balances. As guarantor of the loan, GOI would
charge TEC a guarantee fee to make the effective rate of interest for TEC
equal to 10.25% per annum which is similar to that of public sector corpora-
tions to whom Bank Group assistance is being given.
5.13      As a step towards firming up the loans of Rs 550 million (US$64
million) from local financial institutions (a consortium led by ICICI), TEC
has arranged for the Institutions to submit letters of unqualified commitment
in support of their intentions to lend. The receipt of these letters in a
form satisfactory to the Bank is a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
In connection with the proposal to raise additional equity capital, planned
for FY1981 and FY1982, new shares will in the first instance, be offered to
existing holders of ordinary and preference share capital. Shares which may
not be taken up by the existing shareholders along with the balance of Rs 2.8
million of the total of Rs 175 million will then be offered for public issue.
The issue would be underwritten. During negotiations TEC agreed that the
equity share capital of Rs 175 million would be raised by March 31, 1982.
For the balance of new capital requirements, the Maharashtra Government has
indicated that it would provide, together with security deposits to be col-
lected by TEC from its consumers, an amount up to Rs 172 million. Consumer
security deposits, which would carry interest at 5.5% per annum, could provide
Rs 150 million so that the Maharashtra State's contribution could be up to
Rs 22 million. The foregoing arrangements are acceptable to the Association.
5.14      GOI intends to borrow DM 85 million (US$37 million) from Germany,
acting through the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) to assist in financing
the foreign currency involved in purchasing the turbogenerating unit and its
associated equipment for the Project. This loan would not be relent to TEC.
5.15      From FY1984, TEC's forecast internal cash generation will be re-
quired to meet an additional annual repayment of loans amounting to Rs 98
million (based on 15 years repayment) whereas the additional cash flow pro-
vided by depreciation on the project (based on a life span of 30 years) would
only amount to Rs 51 million. During negotiations it was agreed that commen-
cing from April 1, 1983, for purposes of determining tariffs under section



- 26 -
XVII(2)(c) of the Sixth Schedule of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948, TEC
would make provision each year for such special appropriation as may be neces-
sary to meet the cash shortfall for debt redemption. The giving of this
permission to TEC by the Government of Maharashtra to enable it to make
these provisions will be a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
Debt Control
5.16      The Companies Act 1956 (Section 293) provides that the Board of
Directors of a public company shall not, except with the consent of such public
company in general meeting, borrow money where the money to be borrowed to-
gether with the money already borrowed would exceed the paid up capital and
"free reserves" i.e. those reserves not set apart for any specific purpose.
5.17      To enable the Directors to borrow funds to finance construction
of the project which would necessarily exceed the paid up capital and free
reserves, TEC, at their Annual General Meetings on September 20, 1977 agreed
to raise the borrowing ceiling to Rs 2,379.3 million. During negotiations
TEC undertook not to incur any new debt, without prior consultation with the
Bank, if it would require revising the ceiling still further. The purpose
of this limitation is not to prevent further borrowing but to alert the
Bank to any proposed borrowing which would exceed the forecast borrowings
until the project is completed. Thereafter, the forecast level of annual
capital expenditure falls to Rs 30 million.
Future Finances
5.18      With the assumed additional revenues to meet interest during
construction up to FY1983 and thereafter, and the additional revenues to
meet the cash shortfall for debt redemption, TEC would continue to have small
annual amounts of retained earnings each year. Its internally generated fund
would effectively finance 17% of the investment program in the period FY1978
to FY1983.
5.19      TEC's capital structure would remain satisfactory throughout the
period to FY1985, although new loans are expected to finance 89% of the in-
vestment program during the construction period FY1978-FY1983. This would
raise the ratio of unpaid debt to capitalization to 49% (FY1979), 64%
(FY1980), 72% (FY1981) and 73% in FY1983 before falling to 67% by FY1985.
5.20      TEC has a deferred tax liability as of March 31, 1978 of Rs 124
million which is equal to the imputed tax on the difference between the
accelerated depreciation allowed as a deductible for tax purposes under
the Income Tax Act 1961 (based on the declining balance method) and the
depreciation in the books at rates prescribed in the Seventh Schedule to
the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948 (based on the straight line method).
5.21      The Sixth Schedule of the Act permits TEC taxes to be admissible
expenses for rate making purposes. This means that the sum equivalent to
the reduction in income taxes obtained by taking the accelerated depreciation
reported in the books, is omitted from the calculation of prices charged for



- 27 -
power during the first half of the life of an asset. In theory, assuming
the rate of tax remains constant, the reduction in tax resulting from the
higher depreciation allowances during the first half of an asset's life
should equalize the additional tax in the second half. But TEC is a licensed
company whose license is due to expire in FY1999, i.e., after TEC has repaid
the Bank's loan. By that time, TEC would have a forecast liability of Rs 456
million for deferred taxes which had not been provided for in the tariffs of
the company. The question to be resolved in due course is whether or not any
unpaid deferred tax liability, when the license terminates, would then crystal-
lize to become a debt to be liquidated by TEC.
VI. JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The justification for the additional capacity which will be provided
by the Project is based primarily upon the demand for power in Maharashtra.
The shortage of capacity since the early 1970s leading to pcwer cuts of up
to 30% and the possibility of a continuation of this situation through the
1980s which has already been discussed in Chapter III, demonstrates that,
even with additional capacity provided by the Project, the presently approved
development program will be inadequate to meet the forecast annual load growth
of around 10% in Maharashtra State. The expected deficit is such that only a
7% growth rate can be fully accommodated until 1983/84. In fact, even if
demand were to grow at only 3% annually after 1983/84, all the planned base
load investments, including the Project, would be needed. While demand pro-
jections 10 years or so ahead are uncertain, these figures suggest that it
is most unlikely the extra 500 MW of capacity provided by the Project would
be underutilized.
6.02      Many factors were taken into consideration when deciding that the
additional capacity should be installed as an extension to the existing
Trombay power station. The initial motivating factor was that the demand
of TEC's consumers had been exceeding its firm generating capacity for some
years and had necessitated a bulk purchase of power from MSEB which by 1976/77
was in excess of 500 MW. MSEB is also suffering from a capacity shortage and,
to the extent that the capacity provided by the Project will decrease TEC's
dependence upon purchased power, MSEB's capacity thus released will be avail-
able to meet its own expanding demand. Also the expertise built up by TEC's
organization over a long period of time along with that of Tata Consulting
Engineers, justifies the selection of this organization for the construction
and operation of India's first 500 MW generating unit.
6.03      In summary, the prime considerations for installing this unit as an
extension to the existing Trombay power station are:
(a)  comparatively short completion time of 4-1/2 to 5 years
against 7 to 8 years for a new site and 6 to 7 years
for expansion at an undeveloped site;



- 28 -
(b)  proximity of loads and a well developed integrated and
reliable power system which ensures negligible investment
in transmission and distribution of power;
(c)  development of some 250 MVA of additional load in the
Trombay area during the next five years which will be
captive demand for Trombay generating plant;
(d)  availability of multiple fuels including the possible
availability of gas from Bombay High;
(e)  ample availability of cooling water at economical cost;
(f)  ease of transportation of heavy equipment required for
an extension of this size.
Comparison of Alternatives
6.04      The justification for the Trombay development is based on the needs
of the Western Region and other alternatives for providing this power were
examined. These were: (a) hydro-electric; (b) nuclear; and (c) pithead
generation.
6.05      The development of hydro-electric potential was ruled out because
the most readily available and economic hydro sites that could supply the
Western Region are to be developed in parallel anyway; they are supplements
and not alternatives to the Trombay development. There is one large undevel-
oped potential of about 1,000 MW on the River Narmada in Gujarat but this
involves several dams, is an expensive development with a long gestation
period, and would be subject to agreement between three States on sharing the
waters (a time consuming process) before feasibility studies could commence.
The nuclear alternative was eliminated because of the long gestation period
(8-10 years for the first unit).
6.06      The conventional thermal alternative which was considered was the
installation of the 500 MW unit at a pit head. This alternative is, to some
extent, academic since the Project will largely be supplying a captive indus-
trial load in the Trombay area and from a technical viewpoint, apart from
security of supply with local generation, power generated at pithead some
700 kIn distant would never reach Bombay but would merely supply intermediate
load centers, releasing power generated by nearer power stations for trans-
mission to the Bombay area. Nevertheless, this is the most realistic alter-
native and it was examined in some detail.
6.07      The construction of the 500 MW power station at the pithead would
involve substantial associated 400 kV transmission and additional infrastruc-
ture and civil work costs. Also, since the site would be undeveloped, con-
struction would be over a longer period and benefits would be delayed by at
least two years. On the other hand higher fuel costs associated with the
Trombay 500 MW extension (Rs 160 per ton compared with a pithead price of
around Rs 77 per ton) would largely offset these additional costs. The



- 29 -
comparison between the pithead alternative and the Project shows that at
market prices using a discount rate of 10%, the present worth of the cost
streams of the Trombay 500 MW extension is the lower, with a difference of
Rs 286 million. This decreases slightly to Rs 248 million if labor and
foreign exchange are shadow priced. The equalizing discount rate at market
prices is 6%, and at any rate greater than this the present worth of the
Project cost streams are less than those of the pit-head alternative because
the Project is less capital intensive. These results demonstrate that in-
stallation of the 500 MW unit at Trombay is the more economic of the two
alternatives. A detailed discussion of these estimates is given in Annex 12.
6.08      The alternatives of extending an existing power station in
Maharashtra and constructing a new power station with smaller (200 MW) units
were also examined. However the higher capital and operating costs compared
with the Trombay 500 MW extension, together with the cost of associated trans-
mission, indicated that neither of these were realistic alternatives.
Return on Investment
6.09      In estimating the internal rate of return, revenues were based on
financial requirements. For the purposes of this calculation, which equates
the present worth of project costs with the present worth of attributable
revenues, both costs and revenues are at 1977 prices. On this basis the
return on the investment is just over 14%. Shadow pricing foreign exchange
and local labor has no significant effect on this result.   These results were
subjected to sensitivity tests. A reduction in revenues of 10% reduces the
return to about 12% and a 10% increase in capital and operating costs reduces
it to 13%. If the cost increase and reduction in revenues coincide, the
return would be just under 11%, which is still satisfactory. The methodology
underlying these calculations is described in Annex 12.
Project Risks
6.10      With the commissioning of India's first 500 MW generating unit, the
only real risk is the possibility of pre- and post-commissioning problems, with
consequent heavy outage during the early years after commissioning. However,
the first unit will be almost entirely manufactured in Germany by Kraftwerk
Union, the firm with which Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited has concluded a
cooperation agreement, and, bearing in mind the long experience of this firm
in the manufacture of 500 MW units and larger, teething troubles may not prove
a serious problem. The same comment applies equally to the steam generator,
as the contract award would go to a firm with broad experience in this size
of equipment, or to a firm associated through a cooperation agreement with a
manufacturer with such experience. Additionally, TCE's system designs and
plant specifications are subject to review by Ebasco Services who are expe-
rienced in the design and supervision of construction of projects of this
size. In other respects the project risks are no greater than can be ex-
pected with other developments of this nature.

Assumptions Used for Financial Statements
1.        The statements in this report present forecasts of TEC's financial
operations for the period FY1977 through FY1985. They include income state-
ments, incorporating forecasts of the generation and sales of energy (Annex
6), sources and application of funds (Annex 7), balance sheets (Annex 8)
estimated clear profit statement with calculation of the forecast average
energy prices each year (Annex 9), and details of the capital base, and the
calculation of the annual amounts of reasonable return (Annex 10).
2.        The following assumptions have been used.
Income Statements (Annex 6)
(a)  Energy output from 500 MW generating unit would reach full
commercial operation when operating at 6,000 hours a year
(load factor = 68%).
(b)  TEC would adjust its selling prices annually to achieve
a "clear profit" equal to the annual " amount of
reasonable return." The calculation of the forecast
average prices are detailed in Annex 9.
Fuel Cost
(c) The cost of fuel is based on 1977 fuel prices as follows:
For Units 1, 2, 3 and 4 -
Fuel Oil averaging                    Rs 880 per tonne
Coal         do                       Rs 170 per tonne
For Unit 5 -
Fuel Oil averaging                    Rs 850 per tonne
Coal         do                       Rs 170 per tonne
TEC's operates a fuel adjustment clause which permits price adjustment by
means of a surcharge to meet variations in fuel costs. No attempt is made
to estimate fuel cost increases after 1977 so that revenue does not need
adjustment.



ANNEX 11
Page 2 of 3
Other Operating Costs
(d) For FY1977 to FY1979 costs are based on expected increases
of about 5% and thereafter, are assumed to increase at 3%
per annum. Insurance charges are computed separately at
0.75% of original costs and included in the total.
Depreciation
(e)  Depreciation on existing plant is provided in accordance
with 6th and 7th Schedule to the Electric (Supply) Act
1948, using the straight line method of depreciation.
This assumes a salvage value equal to 10% of the original
cost of the asset by the "prescribed period" which is the
assumed life of an asset, set out in 7th Schedule.
Depreciation is brought into account as an operating
expense only from the beginning of the year of account
next following that in which the asset became available
for use in the business.
The annual accruals of depreciation on plant expressed as a per-
centage of original cost are as follows:
Composite Depreciation
Depreciable Plant                   on Original Cost (100%)
Hydroelectric Plant (3 Stations)        )
Trombay Thermal Unit 1, 2, 3 and 4 )
Do       Housing Colony             )            2.7
Transmission etc.                       )
Trombay Unit 5 (Assumed)                            3.4
Interest on Debt
(f)  Assumes   (i)  Interest at the standard rate for Bank loans,
plus a GOI guarantee fee to make the effective
rate 10-1/4% which is equal to that charged
by GOI on the relending of IDA Credits to the
National Thermal Power Corporation, plus a
commitment charge;
(ii) Interest on local loans at 13% per
annum, plus commitment charges at
1% per annum on undrawn balances;
(iii) Interest on loans raised to finance
construction would be met from revenues
(section XVII (2) (b) (IVa) of the
Sixth Schedule).



ANNEX 11

Dividends
(g) Assumes existing rates of dividend would continue to be
paid, i.e. 7-1/2% and 9-1/4% on Preference Shares, and
13% on Ordinary Shares.
Balance Sheets
3.        Gross fixed assets are recorded at original cost.  During con-
struction, forecast projects costs are escalated annually from the 1977
prices at 7% per annum on civil works, and at 7% per annum on Plant
and Machinery up to the placing of the contract which would then be
firm.
Debtors (Consumers)
4.        Forecast debtors (consumers) at the end of each year are assumed
at approximately one month's billing.
Inventories
5.        Forecasts are made on the basis of the quantities of fuel oil,
coal, and materials which should be held in stock at the end of each year.

THIRD TROMBAY THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Project Justification
The Return on the Investment
1.        The return on investment for the Project demonstrates the relation-
ship of the expected revenues to the expected economic costs. In a year
of full operation, it is assumed that the 500 MW of additional generating
capacity will operate on average 6,000 hours each year. The tariff that will
be charged on the basis of financial performance criteria is expected to aver-
age about 24 paise per kWh after 1981; the equivalent tariff in 1977/78 prices
would be about 20.2 paise per kWh. Thus, assuming 8% station consumption and
transmission losses, revenue in the first year will be about Rs 440 million
(at two-thirds of the final output rate) and about Rs 662 million annually
thereafter.
2.        The cost streams for the project at market prices are shown in
Part A of Table 1. All the costs are net of identifiable taxes. The foreign
exchange costs have been phased for the middle years of the investment period,
10% in year 2, 40% in year 3, 40% in year 4, and the remaining 10% in year 5.
Labor costs have been estimated at 15% of equipment costs and 35% of civil
works. Total capital costs in 1977/78 (year 1) prices are expected to be
Rs 1,536 million, net of price and physical contingencies. Operation and main-
tenance costs from year 7 onwards have been estimated at 1.5% of total capital
costs. Other operating costs are based on a fuel cost of Rs 77.5 per tonne
(net of taxes), and transport costs of Rs 82.8 per tonne. On these assump-
tions, the internal rate of return is 14.2%.
Shadow Pricing
3.        Shadow pricing makes very little difference to the rate of return
on the project. The most important cost components to shadow price are for-
eign exchange and labor. In the case of foreign exchange a shadow exchange
rate of 1.16 times the official exchange rate, based on Planning Commission
estimates, has been used. In the case of labor it was assumed that about
70% of the market wage would fairly represent the shadow wage rate. On
these assumptions, the shadow priced rate of return is 14.0%. Sensitivity
analysis on this rate of return is shown in Table 2.
Selection of the Most Economic Alternative
4.        The obvious alternatives to the Third Trombay Development are hydro
or nuclear. In the case of hydro the most readily available and economic hydro
sites that could supply the Western Region are to be developed in parallel any
way -- they are supplements and not alternatives to the project. In the case



ANNEX 12
Page 2 of 5 pages
of the nuclear alternative, the long gestation period of nuclear power develop-
ment (8-10 years for a first unit), the technical problems in developing a
nuclear power station and the attendant political problems eliminate this as
a practicable alternative.
5.        Confining attention to thermal options the only realistic alternative
is the establishment of the additional 500 MW of capacity at a pithead location.
This is however, likely to be an unacceptable alternative since a delay of at
least two years would most likely result from locating the extra capacity on
an undeveloped site. Also, it would raise technical problems and involve
substantial load transfers with a consequential need to reassess the Western
Region and the Central generation and transmission development programs.
However, this alternative was costed out using cost estimates for the project
suitably adjusted to reflect: (a) the reduced operating costs involved in
pithead coal consumption; (b) the higher capital costs resulting from asso-
ciated transmission and additional infrastructure and site development
investments; and (c) the delay implied by extra site development. The
cost streams, at market prices (net of identifiable taxes) are summarized
in Table lB.
6.        The delay implies that benefits would come on stream two years later,
if the alternative were adopted. Thus the benefit streams are not strictly
comparable, which slightly complicates the comparison of the Project and the
alternative; the difference in the estimated benefit streams must be added
to the difference in the cost streams.
7.        At market prices, the equalizing discount rate is about 6.0% (Table
3) and at any discount rate above 6.0%, the present value of the pithead
alternative cost stream exceeds that of the project, because the project is
less capital intensive. At a discount rate of 8.5%, the difference in the
present worth of the cost streams is Rs 217.5 million (see Table 4). This
difference in the present worths increases to Rs 286 million at a 10% dis-
count rate. Shadow priced, the difference is somewhat less at Rs 243 million
(using a 10% discount rate).
8.        If the capital costs of the Project were to increase by 10% and the
recurrent costs of the alternative were 10% less than indicated, the Project
would be only marginally preferred at both market prices and shadow prices.
The economic justification of the Project is therefore sensitive to a capital
cost increase.
9.        The whole comparison shows the Project to be the preferred alterna-
tive. If, additionally the less quantifiable factors listed in paragraph 6.03
of the report, such as availability of multiple fuels and system reliability
are taken into account, the Project is well justified.
