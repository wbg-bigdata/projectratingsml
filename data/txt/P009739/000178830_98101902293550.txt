INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO INDIA
FOR THE THIRD TROMBAY THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan, in an amount equivalent to US$105 million, to the Tata Electric Com-
panies, Ltd. (TEC), with the guarantee of the Government of India (GOI), to
help finance the construction of a 500 MW power generating unit and associated
works. Amortization would be over 20 years, including five years' grace, at
the standard Bank interest rate. The GOI would charge TEC a guarantee fee
in order to bring the effective interest rate to 10-1/4% per annum, the rate
at which Bank Group assistance is being made available by GOI to public sector
corporations.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(1529-IN dated April 25, 1977), was distributed to the Executive Directors
on May 3, 1977. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
Background
3.         India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size and diversity; the country is divided into more than 20 States with
a population of some 630 million speaking over 60 languages. Since Independ-
ence the trend in growth of GNP has been about 3.5% per annum, or a little
over 1% per annum in per capita terms, while over the five years 1971/72 -
1975/76 it fell to as low as 2.5% per annum, in spite of the record harvest
of 1975/76. This unsatisfactory performance is only in part the result of
the low availability of investable resources: while India's domestic savings
effort compares well with other countries at the same average income levels,
however, the net transfer of resources from abroad has never been above 3% of
GNP, and fell to as little as 0.8% between 1969/70 and 1973/74. More signi-
ficant perhaps is the fact that in spite of a marked rise in the investment
rate from about 10% in the early 1950s to about 18% over the past fifteen
years, the trend in GNP growth has remained about the same. This indicates
a marked decline in the efficiency of capital use, as a result of increasing
capacity underutilization, long project gestation, and increased emphasis on
relatively capital intensive projects and sectors.
1/   Parts I and II of this report are substantially the same as Parts I
and II of the President's Report for the Karnataka Irrigation Project
(Report No. P-2223-IN), dated March 15, 1978.



4.        Since Independence the growth of the socio-economic infrastructure
(transport, education, health services, etc.) has been impressive, but has
often been achieved at high cost and has yielded results of variable quality.
Many industrial and agricultural investment schemes have been highly success-
ful, but others have taken excessively long to be completed and have operated
well below full capacity. In some regions of the country, growth and struc-
tural change have been rapid and compare favorably with developments in many
other parts of the world; in other regions there has been stagnation, and in
some, decline. Although national income has increased in most years, there
has been no rise in the living standards of the vast mass of rural and urban
poor, conservatively estimated at 200 million people with per capita incomes
of US$70 per annum.
5.        The structure of the economy has been slow to change.  Agriculture
remains the dominant sector, with its share of national product declining
only gradually from about 50% to 42% over the last twenty years. The share
of manufacturing industry has increased only slowly and, since the late 1960s,
has remained approximately constant at about 16%. There has, however, been
a shift in the composition of manufacturing production, with consumer, inter-
mediate, and capital goods now contributing about one third each, compared
with an overwhelming preponderance of consumer goods 25 years ago.
Recent Trends
6.        In March, 1977, a party other than Congress formed a Government
for the first time since Independence. The Janata, or People's Party, is
a heterogeneous amalgamation of smaller parties which had never before been
able to form a united front. The state of the economy was not a prominent
election issue; in fact the economy was generally stronger than at any time
in the last ten years. Over the two years 1975/76 and 1976/77, the growth
of GDP averaged 5.4% per annum. Agricultural production in 1976/77 did fall
by about 3% but only because of a return to a more normal harvest of 111
million tons after the record 121 million ton output in 1975/76. In fact,
the 1976/77 figure is the second largest harvest on record. The growth of
industrial production accelerated over the past two years from 6.1% in
1975/76 to 9.2% in 1976/77. The volume growth of exports continued its
impressive recent performance, and averaged approximately 13% per annum
over the past two years. This export growth, together with hardly any in-
crease in import levels, has resulted in dramatic balance of trade improve-
ments with an estimated deficit for 1976/77 of less than US$500 million.
In sum, the overall resource position with record foreign exchange and food-
grain reserves, is exceptionally strong, and gives the Government considerable
room for maneuver.
7.        In agriculture the bumper crop of 1975/76 was largely due to remark-
ably good rainfall, both in amount and distribution, while the good crop in
1976/77 was produced under somewhat less than normal weather conditions. A
conspicuous change was the increase in fertilizer use, which rose by about
25% over 1975/76, following marked declines in fertilizer prices. Industrial
production benefited from fewer labor disputes, fuller utilization of in-
stalled capacity in both private and public sectors, a more liberal import
policy, relatively good power availability, and increased demand because of



- 3 -
higher consumer incomes, expanded exports and higher public expenditures.
Inflation re-emerged in 1976/77 as an important issue of economic management.
During 1975/76 the wholesale price index had fallen by 8.5%; but in 1976/77
it rose by 11.6%. The key characteristic of this rise was that it occurred
largely in a few agricultural commodities for which prices had dramatically
fallen in the previous year. In the twelve months ending Septembel 1977, the
increase was less than 5%. The overall price index has shown virtually no
trend over the past three years taken together.
8.        The balance of payments situation has improved dramatically since
the 1973-1975 period. In 1975/76 the trade deficit was $1,530 million, which
was more than covered by US$1,560 million in net aid, US$205 million in net
purchases of currency from the IMF, and US$559 million in net miscellaneous
capital and invisibles (mostly private remittances); indeed, this large
aggregate net resource inflow led to a US$794 million increase in foreign
exchange reserves, to a level of almost US$2.2 billion. In 1976/77, the
balance of payments continued to improve, with exports provisionally, esti-
mated to have increased by US$1,145 million against an imports increase of
only US$85 million, so that the trade balance deficit is now estimated at only
US$470 million. The sharply decreased trade deficit, along with a further
increase in the net inflow of miscellaneous capital and invisibles from abroad
of US$640 million, more than offset the fall of US$350 million in net aid and
the US$365 million repurchases of currency from the IMF, and allowed a US$1.5
billion addition to reserves, which reached a level of US$3.7 billion at the
end of March 1977. The developments have continued in the current year, with
reserves estimated at US$4.8 billion as of October 1977.
Development Prospects
9.        The favorable economic situation gives the Government the opportun-
ity to address the longer-term constraints on growth. The basic task is to
raise the overall rate of growth from its historic range of 3% to 4%. In the
long run this will require raising more resources for investment. But it
will also be important to achieve significantly better utilization of avail-
able resources, partly through an immediate boost to industrial demand.
10.       In agriculture, the basic problem remains that, despite the record
foodgrain crop in 1975/76 and the good crop in 1976/77, the long-term growth
rate of foodgrain production has been unacceptably low, less than 3% per annum
over the last twenty-five years, and less than 2% since 1967/68. This has
meant that only in good years has there been any margin of production to cater
to per capita growth in food consumption, and in normal years it has been
necessary to import food. There is considerable scope for stepping up growth
both by increasing the use of inputs and by raising the productivity of exist-
ing capacity. Three promising developments in regard to the first are the
sharply higher outlays on irrigation in the Fifth Plan period along with a
renewed determination to increase public investment in irrigation even more
beginning in 1978/79 and to complete on-going projects expeditiously, the
indications that private investment in tubewells is picking up again after a
slowdown in the early 1970s, and the continued recovery of fertilizer demand.
With regard to more productive use of existing capacity, there is increased



- 4 -
awareness in the Government that the benefits of irrigation projects can be
much increased not only through command area development but also through
more efficient design and operation of major surface irrigation infrastructure.
Also, hopes have been generated for increasing productivity on both irrigated
and rainfed farms through a reorganized and improved extension and research
system, which has been recently introduced in several States in northern and
eastern India.
11.       A strong effort to raise agricultural growth is essential, not only
to meet food requirements, but also because of the pervasive influence of
agriculture on the levels of activity in other sectors of the economy. This
effort must also be so structured as to increase the incomes of small and
marginal farmers, in order to increase production since they operate 25% of
the cultivated land and account for somewhat more than 25% of production,
and for welfare reasons, since they make up about 70% of rural population
and constitute the majority of those living below the poverty level.
12.       The industrial sector is poised for growth, as serious constraints
on the supply side have been removed by the improved situation, particularly
with respect to coal and imported raw materials and components; however, the
power supply situation is once more somewhat worrisome (paragraph 13 below).
There has been a progressive liberalization of controls and the 1976/77
Central Budget announced a reduction of some taxes on private industry. In
many cases management of public enterprises has improved, as is reflected
in their markedly higher production and profitability as a group. In the
medium term it is the demand for industrial output that will determine indus-
trial growth. In certain industries, export demand will provide a strong
pull on production; this is true, for example, for certain chemicals, some
electrical equipment, processed agricultural products, vehicles and automobile
ancillaries. But the impact of increased exports on overall industrial demand
will grow only slowly given the current low share of exports in sales. If
the higher growth and productivity in agriculture discussed earlier were to
materialize, it would provide a significant stimulus to industry. It is
difficult to specify the linkages explicitly; but because of the large share
that agriculture holds in GNP, the coefficients do not have to be large for
agricultural growth and the concomitant growth in demand for industrially
produced inputs and mass consumption goods to boost overall industrial demand
significantly. A higher public deficit and increased public investments are
the instruments most directly under Government control, and also those that
can increase demand for industrial products most immediately. While the
first budget of the new government projects a relatively small deficit, it
does maintain a 20-22% increase in spending over the likely outlay in 1976/77.
The projected deficit is contingent on the utilization of foreign exchange
reserves; to the extent they are not utilized though increased imports, the
deficit will increase.
13.       The general improvement in the supply of energy augurs well for
India's ability to meet the needs of a more rapidly growing economy. Organ-
izational and transportation problems in the coal industry have largely been
overcome, production is generally sufficient to meet demand, stocks are



-5-
comfortable, and the industry has good prospects for meeting domestic demand
although exports have been cut back as a result of a disruption in the supply
of explosives early in the year. However, the supply of electricity continues
to be a concern, since the power situation is not uniformly good. Power
shortages affect a number of the more industrialized States, particularly
Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana and West Bengal; as a result, there is a con-
tinued constraint on the expansion of industry. This is despite a number of
favorable factors: greatly improved capacity utilization in thermal power
stations, more efficient exchange of power between States, accelerated imple-
mentation of power projects, and somewhat improved availability of finance
for power investment. The underlying reason for the weak power supply posi-
tion is that capacity shortages continue despite the improved investment
program. The prospects for the oil and gas sector have been further improved
by new finds of oil and gas near the large offshore Bombay High field. Crude
oil from Bombay High was brought to shore for the first time in May 1976;
production reached an annual rate of 2 million tons by March 1977, and will
rise to a level of 12-13 million tons by 1984/85. Although India will con-
tinue to import crude at or somewhat above the current level, much of the
foreign exchange burden of rapidly rising imports will be avoided by the
development of these resources. Prospects are also bright for further dis-
coveries off-shore, given the current high level of exploration activity.
14.       Underlying all other development issues is that of population.
Although India's population growth rate of a little over 2% is not high in
comparison with most LDCs, the size of the absolute increment - 13 million
annually - is daunting. It appears, however, that population growth may
have passed its peak in the 1960s, and it is expected to continue to slow
down, both because the birth rate will continue to decline and because the
death rate will not fall as steeply as in the past. It is apparent that
India's family planning efforts suffered a setback following the end of the
recent emergency period, and acceptor rates are at very low levels currently.
However, the new Government has announced its commitment to a voluntary family
planning program and has maintained ambitious performance targets. Although
it will take some time, adoption of family planning practices is expected to
increase to higher levels. Over the longer term, with a sustained family
planning effort, it should be possible to lower the population growth rate
to 1.1% per annum by the end of the century. Our "best guess" projection of
India's population by the year 2000 is 890 million. Many of the benefits of
family planning policy will only be felt beyond the turn of the century, but
the decline in fertility will bring about an early change in the age struc-
ture of the population. The school age group will grow more slowly or not
at all after 1981, thereby reducing the pressures on the primary and second-
ary education system. The labor force, however, will continue to grow at a
fast rate until the end of the century.
15.       India's balance of payments position should be comfortable for the
next few years. The combination of past global inflation and increased ex-
ports have reduced the proportion of export earnings needed for debt service
from 30% in 1970/71 to 16% in 1976/77. The ratio is not likely to rise above
this level in the next few years. Given continuing favorable policies, the
volume of exports should grow by at least 7% to 10% annually in the near



-6-
future; and import needs for fertilizer, POL and foodgrains will continue to
require a diminishing proportion of available foreign exchange. The large
inflow of private remittances shows no immediate signs of declining and should
continue to bolster the foreign exchange position in the medium-term. Imports,
including a variety of capital goods, have already been liberalized signifi-
cantly. Increased public investment and a revival of the domestic economy is
likely to generate substantial additional import demand. However, this should
be quite manageable, given the currently comfortable foreign exchange position,
continued export efforts, and maintenance of the current real level of net aid.
The present situation presents an opportunity to raise the level of investment
and, consequently, reach a more satisfactory level of long-term growth.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
16.       Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 53 loans and 97 development
credits to India totalling US$2,015 million and US$4,934 million (both net
of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$886 million has been
repaid, and US$2,014 million was still undisbursed as of February 28, 1978.
Annex II contains a summary statement of disbursements as of February 28,
1978, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
17.       Since 1957, IFC has made 14 commitments in India totalling US$58.4
million, of which US$13.8 million has been repaid, US$7.6 million sold and
US$6.9 million cancelled.  Of the balance of US$30.1 million, US$23.6 mil-
lion represents loans and US$6.5 million equity. A summary statement of IFC
operations as of February 28, 1978, is also included in Annex II (page 2).
18.       In recent years, the emphasis of Bank Group lending has been on
agriculture. The Bank Group has been particularly active in supporting minor
irrigation and other on-farm investments through agricultural credit opera-
tions. Major irrigation, marketing, seed development, and dairying are other
agricultural activities supported by the Bank Group. Also, the Bank Group
has been active in financing the expansion of output in the fertilizer sector
and, through its sizeable assistance to development finance institutions, in
a wide range of geographically scattered medium- and small-scale industrial
enterprises. IDA financing of industrial raw materials and components for
selected priority sectors has been instrumental in facilitating better capac-
ity utilization in industry. The Bank Group has also been active in support-
ing infrastructure development for power, telecommunications, and railways.
Family planning, education, water supply development, and urban investments
have also received Bank Group support in recent years.
19.       The direction of assistance under the Bank/IDA program has been
consistent with India's needs and the Government's priorities. The emphasis
of the program on agriculture, industry, power, urban development and water
supply remains highly relevant. Projects designed to foster agricultural
production through the provision of essential inputs such as credit for
on-farm investments, command area development of existing irrigation schemes,
intensification and streamlining of extension systems, and seed production



form an important aspect of the Bank Group's program for the next several
years. Special emphasis will be given to projects benefitting small farmers.
Projects supporting water supply, sewerage, and urban development also form
an integral part of the Bank's lending strategy to India for the next several
years. Lending in support of infrastructure and industrial investments will
focus on agriculture-, export- and energy-related projects.
20.       The need for a substantial net transfer of external resources in
support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank economic re-
ports and of the discussions within the India Consortium. Thanks in large
part to the response of the aid community, India has successfully adjusted
to the changed world price situation. However, the basic need for readily
usable foreign exchange assistance, to augment domestic resources, assure
effective utilization of existing capacity, stimulate investment and accel-
erate economic growth, remains. As in the past, Bank Group assistance for
projects in India should include, as appropriate, the financing of local
expenditures. India imports relatively few capital goods because of the
capacity of the domestic capital goods industry. The import component of
projects tends to be especially low in such high-priority areas as agricul-
ture, education, and family planning. For the Bank Group to be able to make
an appropriate contribution to the financing of projects in these sectors, it
is important to cover a proportion of local expenditures.
21.       It is clear from the review of the Indian economy that as much as
possible of India's external capital requirements should be provided on con-
cessionary terms. Accordingly, the bulk of the Bank Group assistance to
India has been, and should continue to be, provided from IDA. However, the
amount of IDA funds that can reasonably be allocated to India remains small
in relation to India's needs for external support, and some Bank lending
to India, for which the country is creditworthy, is appropriate. As of
January 31, 1978, outstanding loans to India totaled US$1,168 million,
of which US$662 million remained to be disbursed, leaving a net amount out-
standing of US$506 million.
22.       Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion con-
tributed by the Bank Group has grown significantly. In 1969/70, the Bank
Group accounted for 34% of total commitments, 13% of gross disbursements,
and 12% of net disbursements as compared with an estimated 58%, 24% and 29%,
respectively, in 1975/76. On March 31, 1976, India's outstanding and dis-
bursed external public debt was US$13.1 billion, of which the Bank Group's
share was 25%. The Bank Group's share is expected to remain around this
level in the future. Because Bank Group assistance to India is predominantly
in the form of IDA credits, debt service to the Bank Group will rise slowly.
In 1976/77, about 14% of India's total debt service payments were to the Bank
Group.

PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Background
23.       The Indian power sector is within the concurrent jurisdiction of
the Central Government and the State Governments.  The Electricity (Supply)
Act, 1948 assigns extensive responsibilities to the State authorities, but
it also provides for broad guidance and coordination from the Central Govern-
ment. The principal agencies in the industry are the State Electricity
Boards (SEBs), which are responsible for the generation, transmission and
distribution of electricity within each State; the Central Electricity
Authority (CEA); and the two Central Power Corporations, the National Thermal
Power Corporation (NTPC) and the National Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC).
24.       In the 1950s and 1960s, power generation and the expansion of
installed capacity kept pace with consumption, growing on average by about
12% annually. Since 1970 the situation has deteriorated, and power shortages
have grown in frequency and duration as demand for power has outstripped
supply. Between 1970/71 and 1974/75 growth in power generation averaged only
6% annually. Then followed two years of more rapid growth at an annual rate
of 13%. In the first five years of the decade, the main reason for this poor
performance was delays in completing new power projects, which led to short-
falls in capacity below planned levels. Moreover, poor monsoons and an
unreliable coal supply meant that even available hydro and thermal capacity
was not fully utilized. Weakness in the management of thermal power stations
also contributed to the problem. When in 1975/76 and 1976/77 the situation
improved, this was the product not only of two good monsoons and of much
improved coal supply but also of a concerted effort in the power sector to
improve project implementation, thermal capacity utilization and overall
system management. Capacity grew by 10% in 1975/76 and by 8.3% in 1976/77.
However, even these encouraging increases did not eliminate shortages of
power which persisted in 1976/77 and the first half of 1977/78. This
reflects a very low rate of capacity expansion rather than inefficiency in
the operation of the system. Generating capacity throughout India, excluding
2,000 MW of non-utility capacity, currently stands at about 25,000 MW.
25.       While per capita demand for electricity has been rising in India,
it remains among the lowest in the world at about 140 kWh per annum.  Overall
demand is dominated by industry, which accounts for about two-thirds of all
electricity sold.  Agriculture and irrigation account for another 12 to 13%
of demand.  Growth of consumption has been particularly rapid in the rural
areas where more than 80% of the total population live. The number of elec-
trified villages grew from just over 3,000 in 1950/51 to some 200,000, or
about one third of all villages in India, by 1975/76. The number of irriga-
tion pumpsets and tubewells which have been energized increased from 21,000
in 1950/51 to 2.4 million by the end of 1973/74. An additional 1.2 million
are expected to be energized by the end of 1978/79 and a further 2.1 million
by the end of 1983/84.



-9-
26.       To help cope with the power scarcity and to strengthen central
planning and coordination of the power system, the Government of India has
recently undertaken to construct and operate large Centrally owned generating
stations. For this purpose, the National Thermal Power Corporation and the
National Hydro Power Corporation were established in November 1975, with
authority to design, construct, own and operate generating and transmission
facilities and supply power in bulk directly to State Electricity Boards.
Additionally, GOI has authorized Tata Electric Companies (TEC), a utility
company in the private sector, to expand its Trombay power station in the
State of Maharashtra with a single 500 MW unit extension which would be the
large generating unit installed in India.
Bank Group Operations in the Power Sector
27.       The Bank has made seven loans to India for power projects amounting
to US$179.5 million and IDA has made nine credits totalling US$596 million.
All the loans and credits for generating plant (excluding the Singrauli
thermal power project (Credit 685-IN)), the Beas project (Credit 89-IN) and
the first two transmission projects (Credit No. 242-IN and Loan 416-IN) have
been completed. The Singrauli project is still at the early implementation
stage and no disbursements have yet been made; in the case of the Rural
Electrification project (Credit 572-IN), disbursements to February 28, 1978
were US$10.3 million. Of the finance made available for the remaining trans-
mission projects (Credit 377-IN of May 1973 and Credit 604-IN of January
1976), US$80.6 million has been disbursed by January 31, 1978 in the case of
Credit 377-IN and in the case of Credit 604-IN, approximately US$44 million
had been committed by January 31, 1978 in respect of contracts awarded or
under issue. The ongoing power transmission projects and the rural electri-
fication project are proceeding satisfactorily notwithstanding delays in
initial implementation and in preparation of specifications for the more
sophisticated load despatch equipment. The Singrauli thermal power project is
also proceeding satisfactorily.
28.       With regard to the Trombay thermal power station, a Bank loan of
US$16.2 million (Loan 106-IN) was made in November 1954 to Tata Electric
Companies (TEC) to finance the construction of the original 125 MW thermal
power station consisting of two 62.5 MW generating units, boilers and
ancillary plant together with transmission facilities. A second Bank loan
of US$9.8 million (Loan 164-IN) was made in May 1957 to finance a third
62.5 MW generating unit and associated plant. A fourth unit (150 MW), which
was financed with U.S. assistance, was commissioned in 1962.
Maharashtra State Power Sector
29.       Prior to 1954 the more populous areas of Maharashtra State were
supplied by private electricity undertakings operating under license. Upon
its establishment in 1954, the Bombay State Electric Board took over supplies
in Gujarat and part of Bombay. In 1956 the Bombay SEB area was extended to
include parts of Madhya Pradesh, Hyderabad and Kutch; then in 1960 the Board
was split in two to form the Gujarat State Electricity Board (GSEB) and the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). During this time the individual
private electricity undertakings were gradually taken over, and only four
principal licensees are now left.



- 10 -
30.       The four major licensees operate within their concession areas,
and MSEB generates and distributes electricity throughout the rest of
Maharashtra. With the exception of TEC, the licensees are only distri-
butors and buy power in bulk from MSEB and TEC. TEC, which is by far the
largest licensee and operates its own generating plant, is unable to meet
the demand on its system and also purchases up to 500 MW of power from MSEB.
31.       As of March 31, 1977, MSEB had 12 power stations (five hydro and
seven thermal) with a total installed capacity of 1,879 MW, including Koyna
and other hydro power stations leased to the Board by the State Government
for operation and maintenance. TEC has four power stations (three hydro and
one thermal) with a total installed capacity of 622 MW. In addition, there
is the GOI-owned Tarapur nuclear power station with a capacity of 400 MW,
which is shared by MSEB and GSEB, and the 40 MW Chola thermal power station
(owned by Indian Railways), which is connected to the TEC system.
32.        In Maharashtra, there have been power cuts on a sustained basis
since 1972 amounting to some 30%, the brunt of which has fallen on industrial
consumers. The result is that, following a growth rate of around 10% per 1970
and 1971, load growth in Maharashtra fell to an average annual growth rate
around 5% during the next five years. Total installed capacity of MSEB and
TEC is about 2,700 MW (including 200 MW from Tarapur); capacity utilization
averaged 65% during the year ending March 31, 1977, with total energy sent out
at about 13,200 million kWh. Sales of energy amounted to about 10,560 million
kWh, but it is estimated that this figure would have been some 2,000 million
kWh higher in the absence of restrictions. About 28% of all industry in India
is concentrated in the Greater Bombay area and this category of consumer
accounts for about 68% of the demand in Maharashtra State.
33.       Maharashtra's long-term power sector strategy is inextricably linked
with overall development of the Indian power sector. This envisages, as a
first stage, the elimination of restrictions on the availability of power.
Demand for power for the Maharashtra State in 1977/78 is projected to be about
2,480 MW, or about 13% of national demand. By 1983/84, in the absence of
supply constraints, the forecast power requirement will grow at a rate of
about 10% per annum to 4,500 MW. The Tenth Annual Power Survey for India
forecasts an acute power deficiency in the range of 15% to 20% in Maharashtra
through 1983/84.
34.       The long-term objective in the Indian power sector is the develop-
ment of a national power system, a prior step being the integration of the
State power systems to form Regional power systems. In the case of the
Western Region, Maharashtra's system is already interconnected with the
systems of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, but the three systems are not yet
equipped for full integrated operation on a Regional basis. Progress toward
this goal has been slow; sophisticated load despatch equipment is now on
order and the State load despatch centers should be fully equipped in 1978.
Integrated Regional operation of State systems will also require further pro-
gress toward developing an agreed system of tariffs and working conventions
for the exchange of power among States.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
35.       The proposed project was appraised by a mission which visited India
in July/August 1977. The appraisal report (No. 1788b-IN, dated March 28,
1978) is being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. Negotia-
tions were held in Washington in February 1978. The Borrower was represented
by Mr. K.M. Chinnappa, Managing Director; the Guarantor by Mr. R. Swaminathan
of the Department of Economic Affairs and Mrs. 0. Bordia of the Ministry of
Energy. A Supplementary Project Data Sheet is attached as Annex III.
Project Description
36.       The proposed project consists of construction and installation of
a 500 MW generating unit, together with boiler, electrical and mechanical
plant including antipollution equipment and associated works. It will be
erected on reclaimed land (ash disposal area) owned by TEC adjacent to the
existing 337.5 MW Trombay power station. The infrastructure facilities (coal
handling, water and transmission) are already available adjacent to the site
and would be extended to meet the requirements of the project. The project
is scheduled to go into commercial operation in December 1982. This would
be the first generating unit of its size in India and, as such, it represents
a significant technological advance.
Project Cost and Financing
37.       The project cost is estimated at US$209.4 million equivalent,
including US$90.8 million in foreign exchange cost. The proposed Bank loan
would provide about 50% of the project cost. The financing plan is shown in
the Loan and Project Summary at the beginning of this report. TEC has agreed
to increase its equity by March 31, 1982 (Section 3.01(b) of Loan Agreement).
The loans from local financial institutions (a consortium led by the Indus-
trial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited) are expected to be
made available for 20 years, including 5 years' grace, at 13% per annum. The
completion of satisfactory arrangements for the provision of these loans is a
condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan (Section 7.01(a) of Loan Agreement).
For the balance of new capital requirements, Maharashtra Government has indi-
cated that, together with necessary deposits which TEC would collect from its
customers, it would provide up to Rs 172 million (US$20 million equivalent).
Procurement and Disbursement
38.       Except for minor items of equipment costing US$100,000 or less,
all equipment financed under the proposed loan would be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed against 100% of the cost of
consultants' services (US$7 million) and of the cost of electrical and
mechanical equipment (US$90 million). US$8 million would be unallocated.
Indian manufacturers competing under international competitive bidding would
be granted a preference margin of 15% or the current rate of import duty,
whichever is less. It is expected that Indian manufacturers will submit the



- 12 -
lowest conforming bids for most of the items financed under the loan. In
order to permit the consultants to proceed with design work, up to US$250,000
of expenditures for this purpose would be financed retroactive to March 15,
1978.
39.       The turbo-generator and specific associated equipment would not be
financed under the proposed Bank loan. The former would be procured from
Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., which has recently concluded a cooperation
agreement with Kraftwerk Union of West Germany; the associated equipment would
be subject to international competitive bidding. A loan of DM 85 million
(US$37 million equivalent) is expected to be made to the Government of India
by Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of West Germany, to meet the foreign
exchange cost of the turbo-generator and associated equipment; an equivalent
amount will be raised for the project as part of the borrowing from Indian
financial institutions.
Project Implementation
40.       TEC would be responsible for project implementation.  TEC consists
of three separate private sector companies 1/ established in 1910, 1916, and
1919, which operate as a group under the same management. Each of the three
companies operates under an individual license, and the Trombay Thermal Power
Electric License 1953, under which the Trombay power station is operated, is
granted jointly to all three. TEC forms part of the Tata group of enterprises,
which has substantial financial resources, an excellent credit rating, first-
class managerial ability, and a long and successful history of operations in
many industrial and other fields in India. TEC itself is also well managed
and operated in accordance with sound utility and commercial principles. Its
management and staff are fully competent to implement the proposed project
efficiently.
41.       The four licenses involved expire on June 30, 1980.  The Government
of Maharashtra has agreed in principle to an extension of TEC's licenses for
a period coterminous with the last repayment of the Bank loan. Among the
conditions of the license extension, which is expected shortly, is an agreed
redefinition of TEC's licensed area of supply. TEC and MSEB would begin dis-
cussions on July 1, 1984 to arrive at a mutually acceptable agreement for
further redefinition of TEC's licensed area; GOI has agreed to obtain, as
a condition of loan effectiveness, an undertaking from the Government of
Maharashtra that this will not adversely affect TEC's financial operations
(Section 3.06 of Guarantee Agreement). Formal extension of the licenses is
a condition of disbursement of the Bank loan (paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 to
Loan Agreement).
42.       The project is being engineered by Tata Consulting Engineers, the
principal consultants, who are experienced in the design and supervision of
construction of power generation and transmission projects, both in India and
1/   The Tata Hydro-Electric Power Supply Company, Ltd., The Andhra Valley
Power Supply Company, Ltd. and The Tata Power Company, Ltd.



- 13 -
abroad. However, since they have no previous experience in the engineering of
generating units with a capacity as large as 500 MW, TEC has agreed to engage
consultants experienced in the design and construction of units of this size
to assist Tata Consulting Engineers in the more sophisticated areas (Section
3.02 of Loan Agreement). Ebasco Services Inc. of the US have since been
engaged as review consultants and will assist Tata Consulting Engineers in
the basic engineering and detailed design of the project and in other areas
as required.
43.       An acceptable project implementation plan has been submitted to
the Bank. Design work is already underway, as is the preparation of speci-
fications and tender documents for the steam generator, which has a long
lead time, with a view to award of the contract by June/July 1978.
44.       Sea water would be used for cooling purposes through an extension
to the existing pump house. The Bombay Municipal Corporation, which is the
source of fresh water for the existing Trombay thermal power station, has
confirmed that it will be in a position to meet the additional demand (about
1.2 million gallons per day) when the 500 MW unit is commissioned. No asso-
ciated transmission is required, as power from the proposed project would be
fed into the existing 220 kV network through an extension to the switchyard
at the power station.
45.       The boiler would be designed for triple firing (oil or gas from the
Bombay High offshore fields or coal from Central India coal fields). The
estimated annual coal requirement of the 500 MW unit is 1.35 million tons,
but to provide for greater use of coal by existing units 3 and 4, plans should
be made based on the assumption that up to two million tons a year may be
required. 1/ GOI has agreed to take all necessary steps to ensure that
adequate coal supplies are available and that adequate rail facilities are
available to transport at least two million tons a year to Trombay by the time
the project is completed (Section 3.04 of Guarantee Agreement).
46.       The location of the new 500 MW generating unit is in an industrial
area on the outskirts of Bombay on coastal land adjacent to the existing
Trombay power station. Since there are no residential properties in the near
vicinity, no resettlement problems are involved. TEC has agreed to take
adequate measures to minimize the adverse ecological effects of the project,
in accordance with standards prescribed by national, state or local authori-
ties (Section 3.06 of Loan Agreement). The 500 MW generating unit will
be equipped with an electrostatic precipitator with a stack which will be
designed for a height of 500 feet to ensure greater dispersion of emissions,
together with heat dissipation and ash disposal facilities. The Project
includes provision for a sulphur dioxide removal system. However, as the
Singrauli coal which is being used at Trombay has a relatively low sulphur
content (0.3-0.6%), the emission level is not likely to provide an environ-
mental hazard. Consultants would be engaged to carry out a study to determine
appropriate measures, if any, which might be necessary to remove sulphur
dioxide from the flue gases in order to meet national, State or local envi-
ronmental standards.
1/   Units 1 and 2 are equipped for oil firing only.



- 14 -
47.       The conditions laid down by GOI in approving the proposed credit
include a requirement that TEC make available to the Central Electricty
Authority and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. the expertise acquired in the
design, construction and operation of the 500 MW generating unit to be
installed under the project, and to make available facilities for training
a reasonable number of personnel selected by GOI in the construction, opera-
tion and maintenance of the 500 MW unit.
TEC Finances
48.       TEC has a successful financial record within the limitations of
the licenses and regulations under which the three companies operate. TEC's
earnings are largely regulated by the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, which
permits the Companies to adjust tariffs once a year to cover operating ex-
penses (including depreciation, interest and income tax), certain appropria-
tions to statutory reserves, other special appropriations and a margin for
profit. While the Act places an effective ceiling on the earnings of a
licensed company, TEC has consistently earned profits and has paid dividends
regularly on its share capital. Investment has been financed primarily from
equity and loan capital, along with a relatively small amount of internally
generated funds. TEC's debt outstanding as of March 31, 1977 represented 43%
of its capitalization.
49.       TEC's investment plan covering the period of six years from 1977/78
to 1982/83 forecasts an investment of Rs 1,984 million (US$230.7 million
equivalent), including US$209.4 million for the Project. TEC's financial
forecasts show that cash generation shortfalls would emerge in 1983/84 and
later years, due to the fact that the additional annual repayment of its pro-
ject loans would amount to Rs 98.4 million (based on 15 years repayment),
whereas the additional cash flow being provided by the annual depreciation
on the project (based on a life span of 30 years) would be only Rs 51 million.
TEC has therefore agreed, for purposes of determining tariffs under the Elec-
tricity (Supply) Act from 1983/84 to include a special appropriation for debt
redemption in such amount as may be necessary each year to meet the cash
shortfall, and GOI agreed to obtain an undertaking from the Government of
Maharashtra that the permissions necessary for this purpose would be granted
as a condition of loan effectiveness (Sections 5.04 and 7.01 (c) of Loan
Agreement and Section 3.06 of Guarantee Agreement).
50.       Although TEC's overall financing plan shows that revenue would only
provide 3% of the total investment during the six year period to 1977/78,
interest during construction amounting to Rs 340 million (US$40 million equiv-
alent) will not be capitalized. TEC's tariffs will be raised each year by
the amount of the accruing interest to discharge this liability. This addi-
tional revenue to meet interest during construction would effectively raise
the proportion of the investment program to be financed from 3% to 17%.
This would be satisfactory.
51.       TEC's borrowing ceiling was recently raised to Rs 2,379.3 million
(about US$297 million equivalent), which is more than adequate to cover its
forecast borrowing requirements. The TEC's debt/equity ratio is forecast
to rise to 73/27 by 1982/83 before declining to 67/33 by 1985, which is



- 15 -
reasonable. In order to alert the Bank to any proposed borrowing which would
exceed the forecast borrowing, TEC has agreed to consult with the Bank before
raising the borrowing ceiling above its present level (Section 5.03 of Loan
Agreement).
Project Benefits and Risks
52.       The proposed project was compared to alternative means of providing
equivalent power to the Bombay area. Oil and natural gas have more valuable
alternative uses (i.e., as feedstock) and are not intended as a long-term fuel
for power generation.   Hydro-electric and nuclear alternatives were ruled out
because of their long gestation periods and because the most readily available
and economic hydro sites are being developed in parallel and are therefore
supplements rather than alternatives to the Trombay development. Comparison
with a 500 MW power station at a coal pithead indicated that, at a discount
rate of 6% or more, the project's costs are less because it is less capital
intensive (i.e., the project's higher fuel costs are more than offset by the
lower costs for associated transmission and infrastructure and by the shorter
completion time).
53.       The project's internal rate of return, comparing revenues based on
expected tariffs with economic costs, is estimated at 14.2%. This result is
affected somewhat by changes in the main variables: a 10% reduction in
revenues would reduce the return to 11.8%, and a 10% increase in capital
and operating costs would reduce it to 13%.
54.       The major plant (turbo-generator, steam generator and associated
equipment) will be manufactured by firms with long experience in the manu-
facture of 500 MW and larger generating units and project risks during
fabrication, installation and initial operational phases should not prove a
serious problem. TEC's system designs and plant specifications are subject
to review by Ebasco Service, Inc. of the U.S., which is experienced in the
design and supervision of construction of projects of this size. In other
respects, the project risks are no greater than can normally be expected with
other developments of this nature.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Tata Electric
Companies, the draft Guarantee Agreement between India and the Bank, and the
Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
56.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III. Special conditions of loan effectiveness are the provision of
loans from local financial institutions, the completion of security arrange-
ments and the securing of permission from the Government of Maharashtra with



- 16 -
respect to the admissibility of certain expenses for tariff purposes
(Section 7.01 of Loan Agreement).
57.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
58.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

The level of disbursements was US$598.6 million in FY77 or 80% of Bank Group
commitments to India in that year. The undisbursed pipeline of US$2,014
million as of February 28, 1978, corresponds roughly to commitments over the
preceding two-year period and reflects the leadtime which would be expected
given the mix of fast and slow-disbursing projects in the India program.
Ln. No. 902    Tenth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$70.0 million loan of June 8, 1973; Effective
Date: August 16, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Ln. No. 1097   Eleventh Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project; US$100 million loan of April 2, 1975;
Effective Date: July 1, 1975; Closing Date: December 31,
1980
Ln. No. 1475   Twelfth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project; US$80 million loan of July 22, 1977
Effective Date: October 4, 1977; Closing Date: March 31, 1983
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company and are designed to finance
the foreign exchange cost of industrial projects. ICICI continues to be a
well-managed and efficient development bank financing medium and large scale
industries, which are often employing high technology and are export oriented.
Loans 1097-IN and 902-IN are fully committed and disbursements have reached
69% and 88% of total loan amounts respectively as of January 31, 1978, which
is slightly ahead of schedule.
Cr. No. 440    Bihar Agricultural Credit Project; US$32.0 million credit
of November 29, 1973; Effective Date: March 29, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Credit No. 440 provides US$32.0 million over three years in support
of a lending program for 50,000 units of tubewells and pumpsets in the Tirhut
Division of Bihar. Because of slow disbursements caused by a lower than esti-
mated Dollar/Rupee exchange rate and by low unit investment costs compared
with appraisal estimates, IDA agreed to extend the closing date by one year
to June 30, 1978, and to extend the project area to cover the whole State of
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Bihar. The physical targets should be achieved by revised closing date and
disbursements are expected to accelerate.
Cr. No. 715    Second Agricultural Refinance and Development Corporation
(ARDC) Project; US$200.0 million credit of June 1, 1977;
Effective Date: August 24, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979
The above agricultural credit projects are similar in structure,
being designed to provide long- and mnedium-term credit to farmers through
credit institutions, for on-farm investments, primarily in minor irrigation.
Credit 715 is a continuation nationwide of the previous program of agricul-
tural credit projects, which were confined to individual states. Apart from
initial start up problems with the individual state projects, mostly due to
the introduction of new lending criteria and lending terms, progress under
these projects has been satisfactory.
Cr. No. 267    Wheat Storage Project; US$5.0 million credit of August 23,
1971; Effective Date: November 14, 1972; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978
Cr. No. 747    Second Foodgrain Storage Project; US$107.0 million credit of
January 6, 1978; Effective Date:  April 6, 1978 (expected);
Closing Date:  june 30, 1982
The US$16.0 million project (Credit 267), with co-financing arrange-
ments with Sweden, finances (i) the construction of bag and bulk grain storage
and handling facilities, (ii) staff training, and (iii) an All-India Grain
Storage Study. The government-owned Food Corporation of India is responsible
for the storage construction. All the nine 10,000 ton capacity bag warehouses
envisaged under the project as revised were completed and became operational
in 1975. The construction of five grain silos is progressing satisfactorily
and expected to be completed by September 30, 1978. The training component
is being implemented. The All-India Grain Storage Study was completed in
October 1976 and proved useful in formulating the proposal for the Second
Grain Storage Project which was appraised in February/March 1977 and approved
by the Board on November 15, 1977.
Cr. No. 456    Himachal Pradesh Apple Processing and Marketing Project;
US$13 million credit of January 22, 1974; Effective Date:
September 26, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This project provides US$13.0 million to promote the development
of apple processing and marketing in Himachal Pradesh, and comprises grading
and packing centers, cold storage facilities, a juice processing plant, road
improvements and cableways. The project also includes on-farm cold storage
and oak mushroom production. The main executing agency is the Himachal
Pradesh Horticultural Produce Processing and Marketing Corporation (HPMC).



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 14
The project encountered initial delays due to managerial and technical prob-
lems; however remedial measures have been taken to overcome these difficul-
ties. Land is expected to be acquired for all packing and grading sites
by early 1978. The Project Preparation Report for the juice processing
plant has been completed and found satisfactory, and tenders on the equip-
ment are being called. The road improvement programme is progressing
satisfactorily, and the feasibility reports on aerial cableways at the
packing/grading sites are also expected to be completed shortly. As a
result of the significant improvement in project implementation during the
past year, disbursements have recently gathered momentum.
Cr. No. 403    Telecommunications V Project; US$80.0 million credit of
June 25, 1973; Effective Date: July 30, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
Ln. No. 13131  Telecommunications VI Project; US$80.0 million loan
of July 22, 1976; Effective Date: September 14, 1976;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980
Both projects are progressing satisfactorily. The closing date of
Credit 403 was extended by one year to December 31, 1978, to cover the
delivery and installation of imported transmission and switching equipment.
Disbursements under Loan 1313 have commenced.
Cr. No. 377    Power Transmission III Project; US$85.0 million credit
of May 9,, 1973; Effective Date: October 31, 1973; Closing
Date: September 30, 1978
Cr. No. 604    Power Transmission IV Project; US$150.0 million credit of
January 22, 1976; Effective Date: October 22, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1981
For Power Transmission III all equipment has been ordered;
for Power Transmission IV, bids for all equipment have been invited and
most orders have been placed.
Cr. No. 481    Trombay IV Fertilizer Expansion Project; US$50.0 million
credit of June 19, 1974; Effective Date: August 21, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Cr. No. 520    Sindri Fertilizer Project; US$91 million credit of December 18,
1974; Effective Date: February 27, 1975; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978
Ln. No. 1079   IFFCO Fertilizer Project; US$109 million loan of January 24,

Cr. No. 598    Fertilizer Industry Project; US$105.0 million credit
of December 31, 1975; Effective Date: March 1, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Progress on the Trombay IV project has been good although project
completion may be delayed by about 18 months due to longer than expected
delivery times for critical equipment and to reflect the current situation
with respect to the use of the Credit proceeds. Under the Sindri project
plant construction and erection is proceeding generally according to schedule
except for a one-month delay due Lo aILLicipated delys il LeUeipL of some
materials.  Commencement of commercial production is expected by March 1978.
The anticipated cost to complete the project is presently running within bud-
get. The IFFCO project was delayed by about a year as a result of a change
in feedstock from fuel oil to naphtha and delays in completion of engineering
contracts. The project is now progressing satisfactorily based on naphtha as
feedstock. Site work has begun, process- and time-critical equipment is being
ordered, and engineering work is well under way. Credit 598-IN is designed
to increase the utilization of existing fertilizer production capacity. The
project has encountered delays in sub-project preparation and investment
approvals by the Government. Further, some of the sub-projects identified
earlier may not materialize because of reconsideration by the Central and
State governments. The Central Government has submitted a list of sub-
projects to replace the ones that are likely to be dropped. Because of the
above, the project is likely to be delayed by 6512 mor.ths.
Cr. No. 294    Bihar Agricultural Markets Project; US$14.0 million credit
of March 29, 1972; Effective Date: July 31, 1972; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
Cr. No. 378    Karnataka Wholesale Agricultural Markets Project; US$8.0 mil-
lion credit of May 9, 1973; Effective Date: September 7, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
These projects were designed to help with establishment of wholesale
markets in a number of towns in Bihar and Karnataka. Progress under the Bihar
project has generally been satisfactory. The project includes training of the
Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) staff and evaluation of the
project's economic impact. Development plans have been completed for all of
the 50 project markets, but commencement of implementation is being delayed
for some of the markets pending land acquisition. Appraisals and loan sanc-
tions had been completed for 13 and were in progress for 18 markets. Farmers
and traders served by the 8 market yards now in operation report more effi-
cient marketing activities and improved farmers' terms of trade. Progress
under the Karnataka project is improving. As of August 1977, when the project
was last reviewed appraisals for 36 of the 39 project market yard plans had
been completed by participating banks and 25 of these 36 approved by ARDC.
Construction is in progress at 33 markets. In an attempt to accelerate project
progress, more liberal lending terms have been provided to APMCs and Market
Intermediaries (MIs) for construction of shop-cum-godowns. The project is
expected to be completed by the closing date (December 1979) and to achieve
its' major objectives of making farm produce marketing more efficient and
improving farmers' terms of trade.

Cr. No. 312    Population Project; US$21.2 million credit of June 14, 1972;
Effective Date: May 9, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This credit is designed to finance an experimental and research
oriented population project in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.  The project's
infrastructure, which would provide the optimum facilities (buildings, equip-
ment, staff and transport) according to GOI standards in selected districts
in each state, is almost complete. The two Population Centers, which will
design and monitor research aimed at improving the family planning program,
are now functioning. To allow adequate time for the Population Centers to
complete their evaluation of family planning strategies and the introduction
of management information and evaluation systems, the closing date has been
extended to June 30, 1979.
Cr. No. 342    Agricultural Universities Project; US$12.0 million credit of
November 10, 1972; Effective Date: June 8, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
The project involves the development of the agricultural uni-
versities in Assam and Bihar. Initial lag in implementation on account
of late appointment of project staff has been overcome. Campus plans
have been approved, and construction has started in both Assam and Bihar.
Disbursements which have been slow because of initial delays should
accelerate now that construction and equipment procurement are under way.
Cr. No. 356    Industrial Development Bank of India Project; US$25.0 million
credit of February 9, 1973; Effective Date: June 22, 1973;
Closing Date: September 30, 1978
Loan No. 1260  Second Industrial Development Bank of India Project;
US$40.0 million loan of June 10, 1976; Effective Date:
August 10, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
Loan No. 1551  IDBI Joint/Public Sector Project; US$25.0 million loan of
March 1, 978; Effective Date: May 31, 1978 (expected);
Closing Date: March 31, 1983
The first IDBI Project (Cr. 356) had a slow start mainly due to
institutional problems in the participating State Financial Corporations.
However, the credit is now fully committed.  In order to continue Bank
Group's involvement in assisting small and medium scale industries and in
strengthening the State Financial Corporations involved, the second operation
(Ln. 1260) was approved on May 18, 1976, and more than 25% of the loan amount
had been committed by mid-March 1978.
Cr. No. 390    Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$55.0 million
credit of January 22, 1974; Effective Date: March 13, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Having overcome earlier difficulties, including cost overruns caused
by inflation (requiring project redefinition in February 1975), redesign of



ANNEX II
Page 8 of 14
major project components and an unforeseen addition of a supplementary study
on sewage disposal, the project is now progressing relatively well. All of
the major contracts for the water supply components have been awarded and
it is forecast that works will be sufficiently advanced to permit the supply
of additional water in the last quarter of 1978; completion of water treatment
works for the whole supply by the end of 1979 is realistically forecast.
Completion of additional sewage disposal studies (August 1977) has allowed
engineering design of the project sewerage components to proceed, so that
completion of construction of these works is now scheduled for 1980 two years
later than originally forecasted. Financial performance of the project entity
is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 585    Uttar Pradesh Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$40.0
million credit of September 25, 1975; Effective Date:
February 6, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project had a slow start due to delays in preparation of techni-
cal reports for regional and local water authorities. The technical reports
for about a half of the project have now been finalized and construction
works started in October 1976, about one year behind schedule. All consul-
tants for engineering, organization, management and accounting services for
the Jal Nigam (Water Supply Development Corporation) and the Jal Sansthans
(water authorities) have been engaged. Significant institutional develop-
ment can be expected only after thle consultants submit their final recommenda-
tions. The project is expected to be completed by March 1980, approximately
9 months behind schedule.
Cr. No. 616    Eleventh Industrial Imports Project; US$200.0 million credit
of February 26, 1976; Effective Date: April 1, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1978
Utilization of the Technical Development Fund has been slower than
anticipated and the closing date has been postponed by one year to allow
completion of disbursements from the Fund which has been fully committed.
Cr. No. 427    Calcutta Urban Development Project; US$35.0 million credit
of September 12, 1973; Effective Date: January 10, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Cr. No. 756    Second Calcutta Urban Development Project; US$87.0 million
credit of January 6, 1978; Effective Date: April 10, 1978
(expected); Closing Date: March 31, 1983
For the first of these project, following considerable increases in
project costs, GOI and IDA finalized a project redefinition in April 1976, to
accommodate the project to funding available. It is now expected to be
substantially completed by March 1979. Agreements have been reached on
consultants services and technical assistance, as provided for under the
project.

of April 1, 1977; Effective Date: June 30, 1977; Closing
Date: September 30, 1981
The project is designed to develop and promote low-cost solutions
to the problems of providing improved services to the urban poor in the
Madras Metropolitan Area (MMA) and to strengthen metropolitan planning.
Project components consisting of sites and services; slum improvement; small-
scale and cottage industry; and maternal and child health are designed to
benefit directly some 250,000 persons in low-income areas of the city.  The
water supply and sewerage; road and traffic improvements; bus transport and
technical assistance components are designed to eliminate bottlenecks in
water supply and transport.
Cr. No. 482    Karnataka Dairy Development Project; US$30 million credit of
June 19, 1974; Effective Date: December 23, 1974; Closing
Date: September 30, 1982
Cr. No. 521    Rajasthan Dairy Development Project;; US$27.7 million credit
of December 18, 1974; Effective Date: August 8, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
Cr. No. 522    Madhya Pradesh Dairy Development Project; US$16.4 million
credit of December 18, 1974; Effective Date: July 23, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
These three credits totalling US$74.1 million support dairy devel-
opment projects organized along the lines of the successful AMUL dairy coop-
erative scheme in Gujarat State. The Karnataka Project which got off to a
slow start has begun to show considerable improvement under new management
appointed recently. Farmer response has been good and over 500 dairy coop-
eratives with small farmer participation are functioning effectively. All
four dairy unions, as envisaged under the project, have been established and
are functioning satisfactorily. In Madhya Pradesh good progress has been
made. About 110 new dairy cooperatives societies have been established.
Detailed design studies for plant construction are complete. The response
of small farmers to the project is excellent. GOMP has plans to cover all
districts in the State. Technical services investments are being made.
Contracts have been placed for livestock imports. The Rajasthan project is
also doing well.  Four milk unions have been formed and excellent progress
has been made in organizing the servicing of nearly 350 dairy cooperatives
at the village level. Plant-designs are ready, and procurement is making
adequate progress. Karnataka's decision to procure plant equipment jointly
with Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh' on the same tender should lead to a recovery
of considerable time lost earlier in the Karnataka project.
Cr. No. 532    Godavari Barrage Project; US$45 million credit of March 7,
1975; Effective Date: June 9, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980
Both the civil works and equipment tenders have been awarded after
international competitive bidding. Work is in progress and is proceeding
satisfactorily.

Cr. No. 740    Orissa Irrigation Project; US$58.0 million of October 11,
1977; Effective Date: January 16, 1978; Closing Date:
October 31, 1983
These projects, based on existing large irrigation systems, are
designed to improve the efficiency of water utilization and, where possible,
to use water savings for bringing additional areas under irrigation. Canal
lining and other irrigation infrastructure, drainage, and land shaping are
prominent components of these projects. In addition, provisions have been
made to increase agricultural production and marketing by reforming and
upgrading agricultural extension services and by providing processing and
storage facilities and village access roads. Progress of these projects
is generally satisfactory and particularly successful with respect to
agricultural extension.
Cr. No. 541    West Bengal Agricultural Development Project; US$34 million
credit of April 28, 1975; Effective Date: August 28, 1975;
Closing Date:  March 31, 1980
The project provides US$34.0 million over four years mainly for
minor irrigation investments but also for development of markets, agro serv-
ice centers, and support of related government services. Although disburse-
ments have been slower than anticipated there has been a considerable improve-
ment in project organization and administration during the past six months
and disbursements are expected to improve considerably during the next twelve

months. The physical progress of shallow tubewells, and of deep tubewells
for the Minor Irrigation Corporation is satisfactory. IDA, GOWB and ARDC
are combining efforts in order to solve difficulties such as organizational
problems at the farm level; lack of demand for agro service centers; and
finalization of designs for water distribution systems and irrigation
schemes. Positive results, particularly for the water distribution systems
are expected shortly.

Date: February 16, 1978 (expected); Closing Date:
June 30, 1983
Cr. No. 761    Bihar Agricultural Extension and Research Project; US$8.0
million credit of January 6, 1978; Effective Date: April 6,
1978 (expected); Closing Date: October 31, 1983
These projects totalling US$63 million finance the re-organization
and strengthening of agricultural extension and the development of adaptive
agricultural research services with the objective of achieving early and
sustained improvements in agricultural production, particularly foodgrains.
Arrangement for monitoring and evaluation of project progress and impact is
an essential feature of these projects. The Orissa and Assam projects also
provide funds for laying the basis for longer term improvements in ground-
water development in the States. The project's components include provision
of additional staff, training facilities, housing, offices, laboratory
facilities, equipment and transportation.
Cr. No. 526    Drought Prone Areas Project; US$35.0 million credit of
January 24, 1975; Effective Date: June 9, 1975; Closing
Date: June 30, 1980
Overall physical progress of the Drought Prone Areas project (DPAP)
continues to be satisfactory. The rate of disbursement is improving and
implementation of most components is proceeding, by and large, according to



ANNEX II
Page 12 of 14
schedule. However, progress may be affected by possible changes in thinking
at the national level. GOI is presently reviewing all national rural develop-
ment programs, including the DPAP, in order to determine ways to improve over-
all performance in the rural sector. The Government's review is being fol-
lowed closely to determine whether any recommendations would have an impact
on the ongoing project and require changes.
Cr. No. 680    Kerala Agricultural Development Project; US$30 million
credit of April 1, 1977; Effective Date: June 29, 1977;
Closing Date: March 31, 1985
This project would improve tree crop production in Kerala and has
particular emphasis on increasing benefits to small farmers. It comprises
rehabilitation of 30,000 ha coconut and 10,000 ha pepper and 2,240 ha cashew,
and new plantings of 5,000 ha coconut and 1,500 ha cashew. About 25% of the
coconut area would be irrigated for intensive intercropping. Funds have been
provided for development of a seed garden for tree crops and for strengthening
tree crops research. Ten crumb rubber factories would also be established to
process smallholder rubber. Project implementation started slowly due to
initial staffing and funding delays but has recently gained momentum. Pro-
ject actions for 1978/79 have been rephased and advance action planned so
as to make up for lost time.
Cr. No. 572    Rural Electrification Project; US$57.0 million credit of
July 23, 1975; Effective Date: October 23, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
Eleven states have now fulfilled the conditions of eligibility for
on-lending under this project [compared with six at the time of appraisal].
The project got off to a slow start, due principally to the need to adapt
specifications and tender documents to international competitive bidding
procedures, but these problems have been overcome. As of April 1977, orders
had been placed for 60 approved rural electrification schemes, and tenders
had been invited or were in the course of preparation for others.
Cr. No. 582    Railways XIII Project; US$110.0 million credit of August 26,
1975; Effective Date: October 10, 1975; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978
The project was designed to cover most of the foreign exchange
requirements of Indian Railway's (IR) investment program for two years, from
April 1, 1975, through March 31, 1977. However, since the approval of the
project, increased production in steel products in India and further develop-
ments in IR's indigenization program slowed down the rate at which IR requires
foreign exchange. Therefore, the Closing Date was extended for one year to
September 30, 1978 in order to complete implementation of the project.

US$4.0 million credit of February 26, 1976; Effective
Date: May 26, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
This project will identify a sound resource base for pulp and paper
manufacture and related industries, develop suitable logging systems, and
undertake a feasibility study to determine optimal use of the existing wood
resources in the Bastar District of southern Madhya Pradesh. It also includes
a study of ways to integrate the area's tribal population with future develop-
ment.  After initial delays dule to diffiri11t4es in employing key personnel,
project implementation is now satisfactory. The contract for the feasibility
study has been awarded.
Cr. No. 610    Integrated Cotton Development Project; US$18.0 million
credit of February 26, 1976; Effective Date: November 30,
1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
This project finances equipment and civil works and crop production
credit to support programs for cotton research and increased cotton produc-
tion in three states. The project also provides credit for improving cotton
ginneries, new ginneries, cotton seed oil extraction plants and vegetable oil
processing factories. Project management and coordination were established
and the cotton production program has been pursued energetically. Implementa-
tion of the research And industriAl components has started.

Effective Date: October 8, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
This project supports seed industry expansion in the public and
private sectors; improvements in seed quality control; strengthening of
breeding and seed technology research; and development of a reserve stock
scheme. Institutional development and managerial arrangements, particularly
at the state level, have proceeded fairly satisfactorily. Project imple-
mentation, however, slowed down after loan effectiveness mainly due to
organizational problems. Project progress is now being made since approval
of the project by the new Government in September 1977 and is anticipated
to gain further momentum as GOI is about to appoint the two top officers
of the National Seeds Corporation.

Disbursements have been delayed somewhat because of delays in pro-
curement action. However, contracts for bodies and chassis for 325 single
deck and 175 double deck buses have been awarded and some 144 buses have
been delivered. Bids for an additional 200 buses are being evaluated. Civil
works contracts have been awarded for 8 to 15 bus facilities, and 13 of about
traffic engineering schemes. Delays are expected in implementing some BMC
traffic engineering schemes and the BEST workshop schemes although steps are

tration, financial management systems, accounting and development planning
are at work assisting the Borrower, the Bombay Metropolitan Regional Devel-
opment Authority. The beneficiaries of the loan, the Bombay Municipal Corp-
oration and the Bombay Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking, have selec-
ted consultants in traffic engineering and operations and management assist-
ance, respectively.
