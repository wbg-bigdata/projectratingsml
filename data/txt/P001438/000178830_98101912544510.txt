I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Liberi a and the National Iron Ore Company (NIOC)
have requested the Bank to provide two loans totalling US$20 million equiva-
lent to finance a portion of the cost of a two-part project designed to
rehabilitate (i) NIOC's iron ore operations from a virtually bankrupt situa-
tion and (ii) existing railroad transportation infrastructure over which the
iron ore is transported to the port of Monrovia for export. One loan of US$11.7
million equivalent would be made to NIOC and help finance: (i) an increase
in the mine's output from the present level of 2.1 million long tons of iron
ore per year (ltpy) 1/ to 3.25 million ltpy by end 1983, and (ii) rehabilita-
tion of the railroad infrastructure, except for the St. Paul River railway
bridge. The second loan o. US$8.3 million equivalent would be lent to the
Government to rehabilitate this bridge and carry out economic studies of the
region.
1.02      The project is located in Western Liberia on the Mano River and
close to the Sierra Leone border (Map IBRD 15723).  It forms part of Liberia's
effort to maintain economic stability by curbing the erosion of its iron ore
revenues, on which the economy is heavily dependent. The longer-term objec-
tive is to use these revenues to assist Liberia in the diversification of its
economic base and thus prepare for the eventual depletion of its mineral
reserves.
1.03      Project preparation has been undertaken with the assistance of
a US$500,000 Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance granted in September
1979 to finance the feasibility studies and preliminary engineering for
both the mine and the railway bridge. A second PPF advance of uS$500,000
was approved in February 1981 to finance detailed engineering as well as
legal assistance.
1.04      Total financing for the project, including working capital and
interest during construction, is estimated to be US$67.1 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$54.4 million, or 81%.  Of this amount,
US$58.9 million is needed for the NIOC rehabilitation, US$8.0 million
for the rehabilitation of the railway bridge, and US$0.2 million for economic
studies.
1.05      The project was appraised in December 1980 by Messrs. G. de Selliers
(Mission Leader) and B. Stenberg and Mrs. J. Wright (IPD); Messrs. C. Walser
and A. Rigo (LEG) and Ms. L. Lowenstein (WAl). The Bank has played a key role
in the preparation of the project. In addition to providing the financing for
the preparatory studies (para. 1.03), the Bank has assisted NIOC in all
aspects of project preparation including technical aspects, securing of
financing, restructuring of the company and management arrangements. A total
of eight Bank missions, of which four to Liberia, were required over the last
two years to bring this project to fruition.
1/   Five-year average production level for 1976-80.  All Liberian production
and exports of iron ore are measured in long tons of 2,240 pounds/ton.



II. THE M'lNING SECTOR
2.01      Mining is the backbone of the modern sector in Liberia, contributing
more than 54% of the country's export earnings, 5% of Government revenues, and
24% of the country's GDP in 1979. Iron ore accounts for about 95% of total
mine output, with artisanal gold and diamonds accounting for the balance. Iron
ore is extracted by three companies--the Lamco Joint Venture (LJV), Bong Mining
Company (BMC) and NIOC--as discussed below.
A.   Structure of the Sector
1.   Lamco Joint Venture
2.02      The most important mining company is the Lamco Joint Venture which
holds the Mount Nimba Concession on the Guinean border and owns a 265-km
railroad and the port of Buchanan.  LJV is owned jointly by Bethlehem Steel,
US (25%), and by Lamco (75%)--a consortium in which the Government of Liberia
holds 50%, private local and foreign interests 12.6% and a Swedish consortium
headed by Granges AB holds the remaini ng 37.4%.  Granges manages the iron ore
operation through a managing company, the Lamco Joint Venture Operating
Company.  LJV's production capacity is 12 million ltpy of iron ore, although
over the last few years production has been falling, to less than 10 million
ltpy in 1980, mainly because LJV had to stop producing pellets due to prohibi-
tively high production costs in combination with a poor pellet market. The
deposits which LJV is presently mining are expected to be depleted by 1987,
although other deposits have been identified close by. However, as the ore
grade is lower than what is presently mined, construction of beneficiation
facilities estimated to cost about US$300 million would be required. LJV's
future is still uncertain as a decision to undertake this investment has not
yet been made. This decision will also be affected by the future development
of the Mifergui-Nimba project situated in Guinea on the Liberian border.
Current plans call for evacuation of the Guinean ore over the LJV railroad.
2.   Bong Mining Company
2.03      The Bong Mining Company is the second largest iron ore producer
in Liberia, with an output of 7 s5 million ltpy in 1980 from its mines in Bong
County.  BMC is half-owned by the Government, but is controlled by several
European steel companies, consisting of a consortium headed by Exploration und
Bergbau GmbH (34%) of Germany and Finsider SA (16%) of Italy. Besides being
a shareholder, Exploration und Bergbau also acts in a managerial capacity under
a consulting agreement with BMC. BMC's production capacity is 3.3 million
ltpy of concentrates and 4.2 million ltpy of pellets; however, it has recently
had to close down half of its pelletizing capacity because of excessively high
production costs. BMC's reserves are sufficient to allow production at present
levels to continue until the mid-to-late 1990s. However, at the end of 1980,
BMC threatened to cease operations because of its critical financial problems.
A temporary solution to these problems has been found; it should allow BMC to
continue operating, although probably still at a loss. BMC's medium- and
long-term prospects remain uncertain.

3.   NIOC
2.04      The National Iron Ore Company is the third iron ore mining company
in Liberia. A detailed description of the Company is given in Chapter
III. NIOC is 75% owned by the Government, with the balance made up of foreign
and local private shareholders. Its mine is located on the Mano River near
the Sierra Leone border in Grand Cape Mount County and until recently was
producing on average 2.1 million ltpy. Production in 1980 was only 1.7
million tons declining to 1.3 million tons in 1981 due to technical and
financial problems which, if not addressed, will lead to the closing of the
mine. Sufficient proven reserves exist, however, to allow production at the
planned 3.25 million ltpy until 1994 provided the mine is rehabilitated under
the proposed project.
2.05      A fourth mining company, the Liberia Mining Company (LMC), operated
the Bomi Hills deposit in Montserrado County and produced 4 million ltpy until
1977 when reserves were depleted. Until LMC closed, it owned the railroad
from Bomi to Monrovia which forms part of the railroad infrastructure which
NIOC uses to transport its product to the Monrovia port. The mine closure
created a severe unemployment problem in the Bomi Hills region which has not
yet been resolved because no alternative employment opportunities exist in
the area. The Government hopes to avoid a recurrence of a similar situation
through the NIOC rehabilitation.
B.   Contribution of the Iron Ore Sector to the Economy
2.06      Total iron ore production and its contribution to GDP showed average
annual increases until 1974, during which year production amounted to 25
million tons and iron ore revenues accounted for over 37% of GDP.  Since 1976,
however, as a result of the difficulties experienced by the mining companies
(paras. 2.02-05) and the depressed price levels resulting from the steel
crisis in Europe, iron ore's contribution to Liberia's economy has been
declining in terms of tonnage exported and as a percentage of GDP, export
earnings and of Government revenues. Liberia's total tonnage exported fell by
28% from 1974-79, down to 18 million ltpy. Notwithstanding the sharp decline
in exports, iron ore remains the single largest industrial contributor to the
economy, both in terms of its share of the GDP and its share of exports. In
terms of its contribution to Government revenues, the share of the iron ore
mines has been low during the last few years as earnings have been depressed
or negative and most of the concession agreements call for profit sharing
schemes with the Government and no fixed royalties. Therefore the difficult
finanical situation of the iron ore companies during the last few years is
directly reflected in the Government earnings from the sector as shown in the
table below.

2.07      Mining also provides employment benefits and accounts for over
35% of employment in the modern sector, with a greater proportion of skilled
and semi-skilled workers than in the other industrial sectors. The training
benefits provided by the mining activities are substantial and have helped
promote Liberianization of the sector. In 1979, expatriates accounted for
less than 8% of the labor force in the Liberian iron ore sector; at NIOC, this
proportion was even less at slightly above 3%.
2.08      The sector also provides socio-economic benefits to the population
which depends directly or indirectly on the mining activities for its support.
The mining companies provide housing, schooling and medical services in remote
areas of the country. Further, through the maintenance of their infrastruc-
ture, the mining companies provide crucial linkages between these areas and
the urban regions of the country, especially Monrovia.
C.   Future Development Potential
2.09      The prospects of the iron ore sector are uncertain.  As noted, all
operating companies are experiencing financial, technical, and/or marketing
problems (paras. 2.02-04) which might jeopardize their future operations.
Furthermore, the prospects for developing new deposits in the foreseeable
future are slim.
2.10      In addition to the three operating mining concessions, three other
iron-bearing areas are covered by concession/lease agreements. These areas
are the Bie mountains, the Wologisi range and the Putu range. The Bie Mountain
concession is held 50/50 by NIOC and LMC; the Wologisi range is under a 70-year
lease to the Liberian Iron and Steel Corporation (LISCO); and BMC has rights
to the Putu concession. Exploration work has been done in all areas and
reserves are estimated at 200-600 million tons of low-grade (33-41% iron),



- 5 -
fine-grained ores suitable mainly for pellet feed production. 1/ The areas
are also characterized by their lack of infrastructure and would require
substantial investments to be developed. In this respect, Bie Mountain is most
favorably located, about 15 km from the Mano River-Bomi Hills section of the
NIOC railroad. In view of the poor quality of the reserves in these conces-
sions and the high investment costs required to develop them, the likelihood
that these deposits will be developed in the foreseeable future is remote.
III. THE COMPANY
A. Ownership and Concession Agreement
3.01      The National Iron Ore Company was organized in 1958 to develop the
Mano River deposit located about 120 km NW of Monrovia. The Government of
Liberia received 50% of the shares in exchange for permanent exemption from
any profit tax or royalty (para. 3.03). Mr. Lansdell Christie, a US citizen
who had initially explored the deposit and had already formed the Liberia
Mining Company (LMC), 2/ retained 27%, LMC received 15% for the Bie Mountain
and Mano River concessions which it owned, and small US and Liberian investors
(financed principally by Christie) put up the 8% balance. This balance as
well as Christie's participation was made through a holding company called
Liberian Enterprises Limited (LEL) in which Christie owned more than 75% of
the shares.
3.02      Until recently, the Company s original ownership composition had
not changed. Simultaneously with the finalization of the financing package
for the proposed project, a restructuring of the Company's ownership will
take place to reflect the new equity contribution of the Government which was
required as part of the financing plan for the project (para. 6.07) as well
as to cover the 1980 cash short-falls (para. 3.22). Through its equity
contribution of US$12 million and through the acquisition of some of the
shares in LEL which were held by certain Liberian citizens, the Government
will increase its share in NIOC from 50% to 80%, the remainder being distri-
buted 12% to the Christie Estate and 8% to private US and Liberian citizens.
3.03      NIOC was organized under Liberian law iin 1958, when the mining
concession was signed for a twenty-year period. This concession was extended
for another twenty years in 1978. Separate agreements exist for NIOC-s use
(and maintenance) of the Government-s railway (the Bomi-Monrovia link which
the Government took over when LMC closed) and for renting space at the
1/   However, up to 25% of Bie Mountain's production could possibly be low-
grade sinter fines.
2/   LMC was owned 41% by the late Mr. Christie and 59% by Republic Steel
(US). In 1980, Republic Steel transferred all of its shares in LMC to
the Christie Estate which presently holds Mr. Christie's interests.



Monrovia port.  U-nder this arrangement, NIOC has om.ership of all assets at
the mine, plant site and port, as wel as of railway yards, repair facilities
and rolling stock.  In addition, NIOC owns the railway link from Mano to
Bomi. This concession agreement was very favorable to NIOC because, under the
agreement, rno taxes or royalties were payable. Under the proposed project,
it has been agreed that the concession agreement would be amended as a condi-
tion of loan effectiveness in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, to submit
NIOC to the payment of taxes of general application.
B.   Organization and Management
1.   Past Management
3.04      NIOC is governed by a seven-member Board of Directors. Until
recently the Government, in its role of controlling shareholder, appointed
four directors including the President of the Company and Chairman of the
Board, the remaining three being appointed by LEL (2) and LMC (1). NIOC-s
Board, which used to meet only infrequently, did not exercise effective
control over the operations of the Company.  Furthermore, the Government--
although the majority shareholder--did not play a significant role in the
supervision of the Company until 1979, since NIOC's affairs were, by contract,
managed by a managemert firm, Mine Management Associates, Ltd. (MMAL), owned
by the Christie Estate.
3.05      MMAL's involvement dates back to the mine's opening in 1958, when
the first management contract was effected for the duration of the concession
agreement. The contract was renewed in July 1978 for a five-year period but
was terminated in 1979. Although based in New York, MMAL fully controlled
NIOC's operations as all decisions relating to expansion plans, renewal
investments, pay scales and selection of senior-level personnel were taken by
MMAL's small staff. The services actually provided by MMAL were limited in
scope and included: (i) acting as purchasing agent for spares and supplies
procured in the U.S., (ii) accounting and financial work (mostly bank deal-
ings), and (iii) expatriate recruitment. At the mine site, a General Manager
appointed by MMAL was in charge of day-to-day operations. Marketing was, and
continues to be, handled by Caemi International, Brazil (Chapter IV) in the
Hague, which in recent years also handled expatriate recruitment. The manage-
ment fees payable to MMAL amounted to 3% of sales or about US$900,000 per
year, part of which was not paid but accumulated as a liability of NIOC.
3.06      This management arrangement--whereby decision-making was totally
divorced from physical operations--proved to be less than satisfactory and,
therefore, in 1979 the Board of Directors decided to terminate what they
perceived as a costly and inefficient management contract. A termination
agreement was signed calling for payments which have been rescheduled under
the global arrangements mentioned in para. 6.12. Since theri, the management
of the Company has been taken over by the General Manager and the Chairman
of the Board of NIOC on an ad-hoc basis. Under the proposed project, the
organization and management of NIOC will be reorganized as discussed below.



-7-
2.   Proposed Organization and Management Arrangements
3.07      As majority shareholder, the Government will control NIOC in the
future. To ensure a unified management to carry out the project, it has been
decided that the role of the minority shareholders will be limited, with
control of management decisions to be placed in the Government which, by
guaranteeing all of the loans for the proposed project, effectively takes the
entire risk. To provide for this, a voting trust arrangement has been set up
in which all the shares in the Company will be placed, thereby transferring
the control of the Company to the Government through a group of four trustees.
This voting trust arrangement will remain valid until all long-term loans
contracted for the proposed project are repaid. The trustees will appoint a
Board composed entirely of Liberians nominated by the Government. The Board
is expected to meet at least semi-annually and otherwise as circumstances
require.
3.08      The Board will appoint an Executive Committee composed of three to
five members with proven expertise in the fields of mining, finance and labor
relations, to be chaired by the Chairman of the Board. This Executive
Committee will meet at least once a month and is expected to supervise the
operations of the mine closely. The Executive Committee has been appointed
and the terms of reference of the Committee have been agreed with the Bank.
The day-to-day operations of the mine will be managed by a General Manager
located at the mine site, who will report to the Executive Committee. The
General Manager will, however, have extensive responsibilities, especially
regarding technical decisions, in order to enable him to manage operations
effectively.
3.09      Presently NIOC suffers from a severe shortage of qualified manage-
ment personnel. As a result of the perceived deterioration in NIOC's future
prospects and the unsettled climate following the April 1980 revolution, the
number of NIOC expatriates dropped from about 70 at the end of 1979 to about
55 at present. Both the General Manager and the Assistant General Manager
have left, as well as some of the more senior Liberian personnel. In order
to strengthen this deteriorating management situation, the Bank has discussed
with the Government the necessity for outside assistance on a continuing
basis. As a result, an agreement has been negotiated with Met Chem (of
Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Steel) to provide the necessary
management and technical services. This agreement provides for total manage-
ment of NIOC's operations during the project implementation period and one
additional year thereafter. The terms and provisions of this agreement are
discussed in detail in Chapter V. Appointment of Met Chem is a condition of
loan effectiveness.
3.10      The proposed organization chart for NIOC is shown below and is being
reviewed now by Met Chem.

Under this arrangement the 16 departments, which previously all reported
directly to the General Manager, will be grouped along functional lines into
three main units. Each of these units will be headed by a Met Chem-appointed
manager, respectively responsible for operations, technical services, and
financial planning and reporting/administration. These units will report
directly to the General Manager, who is assisted by an Assistant General
Manager. The General Manager, in turn, will report through the Executive
Committee to the Board.
3.11     NIOC employs about 250 Liberian salaried staff and slightly over
1,700 hourly paid workers. Together with the technical experts provided
under the management contract, there will be about 65 expatriates. The
low proportion of expatriate staff to total employees (3%), which is well
below that in the other mining companies in Liberia as well as in other
developing countries, reflects the long history of operation of the Mano River
mine and on the job training of liberian workers.
C.  Past and Present Operations
1.  Past Operations
3.12     The Mano River iron ore deposits were discovered in 1957 and were
developed in two phases. The first phase which started in 1957 comprised,

for an investment of US$27 million, the development of the "Mano I" ore
beneficiation plant which was commissioned in April 1962. However, as
this plant was ill-conceived from the beginning, NIOC rarely met its expected
annual production rate of 3 million tons with plant as initially designed.
3.13      Therefore, a new plant flow sheet was developed and about US$30
million was invested over the 1972-74 period to create the "Mano II" plant
with a production capacity of 4.5 million ltpy of sinter fines. However, the
"Mano II" plant encountered severe operational problems from start-up in 1975,
and NIOC has never been able to meet projected annual output or grade speci-
fications. This was largely the result of poor technical decisions made by
the managing firm and of poor supervision of the engineering firm in charge of
plant modification, resulting in a lawsuit which was settled only recently to
the benefit of NIOC. A breakdown of NIOC-s production and shipments of iron
ore during 1971-80 is shown below:

2.   Present Operations
3.14      The mine is a conventional open pit operation employing both diesel-
driven and electric shovels for overburden removal and digging and loading

ore, and rigid-frame off-the-road trucks for hauling ore to the crusher.
Blasting is required for about 15% of all material being handled, with blast-
hole drilling performed by air track drills. Support equipment consists of
front-end loaders, bulldozers and graders for road construction, bench pre-
paration and haulage road maintenance, and a number of light vehicles for
equipment maintenance, personnel transport and supervision.
3.15      The ore is transported by truck an average of 2 miles and dumped
into the crusher adjacent to the ore beneficiation plant. The crushed ore
is transported on a conveyor belt directly, i.e., without any surge facilities,
into the plant and treated by impactors, mills, jigs, screw and rake classi-
fiers and Humphrey spirals. The products are then conveyed to the two-train
loading bins, loaded into rail cars and hauled by three daily trains 90 miles
to the stockpiling and shiploading terminal in Monrovia. Tailings are pumped
into a ditch running through three completely full tailings ponds to a
small creek which discharges into the Mano River, the result being heavy
discoloration (red) of the river (para. 5.19).
3.16      Infrastructure for the mining operation includes a captive 8.5 MW
diesel power plant, a water supply system from the nearby Mano river, townsite
with a Company-run hospital and schools, warehouse, workshops, port loading
facilities at Monrovia, and a 90-mile single-track railroad with loco/car
repair shops in Bomi Hills. The railroad is paralleled by an unpaved road.
The mine is the only commercial activity of any significance in the area, and
although at least 16,000-18,000 people are directly or indirectly dependent on
it, other linkages with the area's economy are minimal. Most food and other
materials, for example, are brought in from Monrovia.
3.17      At present, NIOC is facing technical problems in all phases of
operations, except for stockpiling and shiploading at the port of Monrovia which
are working satisfactorily. The problems in the mine are caused by a very old
and mixed equipment fleet (trucks, scrapers, shovels) with deteriorating
availability, inadequate maintenance of haulroads and benches--causing produc-
tion disturbances and losses in the rainy season--and a lack of any production
planning and grade control (except on a day-to-day basis) which would enable
NIOC to produce an even plant feed in terms of grade as well as tonnage. The
proposed project will improve mine performance by providing new mining equip-
ment (para. 5.08) and by ensuring that adequate mine planning is carried
out (para. 5.09). The variations in plant feed rates and grades, due to
disturbances at the mine and the lack of any surge facility between the mine
and plant, cause the beneficiation plant to operate unsatisfactorily with low
recovery and production losses. Also, any production stops in the plant will
directly cause ore production in the mine to stop due to the lack of any
buffer between the mine and plant. Variations in plant production have an
impact on the railroad operation, and trains have to be rescheduled constantly.
Furthermore, the existing plant flowsheet is not optimal even if the plant
feed could be kept even in terms of grade. The proposed project addresses
these issues by including the construction of a surge facility and improvement
to the flowsheet of the plant (para. 5.10).



- 11. -
3.18      The capacity of the railroad as such is no bottleneck at present,
provided the maintenance of rolling stock can be kept up and no major derail-
ment occurs. The latter cannot be excluded since hardly any track maintenance
has been done for years and the rail and trackbed are in very poor condition.
Furthermore, one of the railroad bridges, the 35-year old St. Paul River
bridge, is in particular need of repair. The riverbed scouring and corrosion
of the bridge piers have reached such a stage that the bridge has to be
repaired in the near future if a collapse is to be avoided. Temporary repairs
carried out in November 1979 are expected to reduce such risk until more
permanent rehabilitation can be done. Rehabilitation of the railroad track
and rolling stock and permanent repair of the St. Paul River bridge form
part of the proposed project (paras. 5.12-5.13).
3.19      In addition to addressing these areas, the project also includes
management support to improve mining and plant operations and maintenance
(para. 5.14).
D.   Past Financial Performance and Recent Financial Position
3.20      NIOC's past financial performance suffered from the technical
problems described above (para. 3.17). NIOC has been an unprofitable opera-
tion and its financial situation has been deteriorating continuously since
1974, as can be seen in the table below which summarizes relevant sales and
financial data. Detailed historical statements are given in Annex 3-1 and
Annex 3-2.

3.21      NIOC has experienced losses nearly every year since 1974.  The only
exception was 1977 when NIOC benefitted from a peak in its selling prices
while managing to keep its costs at a stable level. NIOC's poor financial
performance is due primarily to high direct operating costs and relatively
low selling prices, reflecting the generally depressed nature of the iron ore
market for the last few years. The arrival of a new manager in 1975 had a
beneficial impact on the operation. The situation tended to improve slightly
from 1976 to 1978 as a result of improved selling prices and substantial
efforts from management to curtail costs. However, since 1979 there has
been a dramatic deterioration. Production costs increased by more than 14%,
production volume remained static, and the 1979 year-end loss was approxi-
mately US$1.7 million. Furthermore, in the same year (1979) the Company was
unable to meet its debt service obligations and was in default on payment of
about US$6.5 million of long-term loans.
3.22      In 1980, the NIOC's situation deteriorated even further, putting the
Company virtually in a state of bankruptcy. As the production fell to around
1.7 million tons, NIOC's losses increased to more than US$6 million which were
covered by commercial bank credit until August 1980, at which time these
liabilities were assumed by the Government, which will turn them into equity.
as part of the financial restructuring of NIOC (para. 6.12). During the first
months of 1981, the Government was financially unable to support NIOC any
longer and NIOC was forced to depend solely on its limited sales revenues
which provided barely enough funds to cover its payroll. At the same time,
NIOC's payables increased dramatically as the company was unable to pay its
suppliers, particularly the oil refinery. Over the last three months, however,
the Government provided about US$3 million to NIOC to cover the cash shortfalls
as well as to finance downpayments on mining equipment.
3.23      NIOC's present critical financial situation is the result of a
long history of technical and financial problems. The continuing losses and
shortage of funds from which NIOC has been suffering since 1974 have prevented
the Company from maintaining its equipment and facilities adequately, let
alone from taking the corrective actions required to resolve the technical
problems it has been facing. Under the proposed project, the financing plan
(para. 6.06) as well as the security arrangements (para. 6.13) have been
set up in a manner that will ensure that NIOC will have adequate working
capital to prevent excessive financial constraints from jeopardizing the
Company's operations as they have in the past.
IV. THE IRON ORE MARKET
4.01      NIOC iron ore is a specialty product for which demand is not
directly affected by fluctuations in the world iron ore market demand/supply
situation. The price of NIOC ore, however, is tied to world market prices.
Therefore, the following review of the iron ore market is very brief and aims
only at highlighting the major market trends as they will influence future
prices. Subsequently, a more detailed analysis of the particular market for
NIOC's ore, the marketing arrangements which have been set up, and projected
prices is given.

A.   Trends in the World Iron Ore Market
1.   Past Trends
4.02      Demand for iron ore is directly tied to raw steel production.  From
1960-75, world iron ore production grew continuously, reflecting the constant
increase in raw steel production. As the steel industry in the major his-
torical producing areas (US, Europe, and Japan) entered into a crisis in 1976,
production and sales of iron ore steadily declined until 1978. The iron ore
market turned up in 1979, and in 1980 iron ore production was 895 million tons
and demand about 880 million tons. Despite this upturn, the present situation
of the iron ore industry is still characterized by an under-utilization of
existing production capacity, estimated at about 1,080 million tpy 1/ (the
capacity utilization factor is estimated at about 83%), and a potential over-
supply estimated at about 185 million tons of iron ore. World production of
iron ore from 1960-80 is given below.
World Production of Iron Ore, 1960-80

1975-80                  0.1
2. Future Trends
4.03      Future iron ore demand is derived from the estimates of future world
steel production. There is general consensus that the increase in steel
production in OECD countries will be about 1 to 1.5 percentage points below
their expected increase in real GNP, presently projected at 3.5% per year.
Various estimates are given below for 1985 production and derived iron
ore demand.

a/ The most likely estimate is 879; the lower end of this range is
an alternative scenario considered by Mitsui as pessimistic.
Projections to 1990 are very uncertain. The various estimates above correspond
to annual increases in iron ore demand ranging from 2.0% to 3.4% per annum
over the period 1980-85 depending on the estimate.
4.04      According to the latest Bank forecast, future potential supply of
iron ore is expected to be 1,100 million tons by 1985, corresponding to an
increase in annual capacity of about 20 million tons. Some iron ore production
will be retired as reserves are depleted, but it is expected that this drop
will be more than made up for by a number of small projects and expansions.
Substantial growth is likely in the late 1980s, but this will depend on the
timing of a few large-scale projects which are presently at the feasibility!
financing stage--particularly in Australia, West Africa and Brazil--which would
account for 50-75 million tons of new capacity in the late 1980s if implemented
as presently planned. Estimates of potential iron ore supply in 1985 are given
below:

World Bank                   1981                     1,100
a! These estimates vary from one source to another both
because of different opinions as to the likely iron ore
retirements and the prospects for implementation of new
projects.

4.05      The medium-term supply/demand balance for iron ore is characterized
by a diminishing oversupply situation (or possibly balance) as illustrated in
the table below.

Potential Oversupply                    150            (40)-130
Whatever the actual demand/supply situation is likely to be in 1985, it is to
be expected that by then part of the unutilized capacity will re-enter produc-
tion; and, if some of the larger iron ore projects are delayed (e.g., the
Carajas project), and others are not added, the market should reach equili-
brium between 1985 and 1990.
B.   Past and Future World Market Price Trends
1. Past Price Trends
4.06      Price trends in iron ore reflect both the evolution of mining
production costs and of the iron ore demand situation. From the 1950s to the
early 1970s, iron ore prices have dropped continuously in real terms as a
result of the reduction in production costs resulting from the opening of
large-scale open pit mines with high levels of mechanization and economies of
scale. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a number of smaller and more costly
mines closed (particularly in Europe) and were replaced in the market by a few
large-scale Brazilian and Australian mines which have largely dominated the
iron ore seaborne trade ever since. The drop in iron ore prices as a result
of this basic structural change is estimated to have levelled out in the early
to mid-1970s.
4.07      In 1975-77, however, as a result of the softening in world iron
ore demand, prices fell also in current terms. The subsequent continuing
weakness in steel consumption and the resulting depressed condition of
the iron ore market resulted in further declines in prices (in constant
terms) in 1977 and 1978. Notwithstanding small increases in real-term iron
ore prices in 1979 and 1980 to cover increased production costs, the prices in
1980 were still well below the 1970-75 level. The present difficult financial
situation of a number of mines around the world shows that the current price
levels are hardly sufficient to cover production costs. Past iron ore
prices are given in the table below.

2. Future Prices
4.08      Future prices will continue to be affected by both slightly
increasing production costs and the supply/demand situation. As discussed
earlier, future supply and demand are expected to move progressively towards
equilibrium and reduction of the present overcapacity. This general
evolution--without being expected to have any drastic effect on iron ore
prices--will contribute to an improving long-term CIF price trend.
4.09      Future production costs for iron ore are not expected to change
substantially in real terms. No fundamental structural change leading to
further larger economies of scale similar to those which took place in the
1960s is expected in the future. The large mining projects which are presently
under consideration are not expected to enjoy substantially lower FOB export
costs than the mines now in operation and therefore the introduction of these
new producers in the market is not expected to exert a drastic downward
pressure on the iron ore market prices. To the contrary, increases in FOB
iron ore prices will be necessary if these new operations are to have a
positive cash flow, especially during the first years of operations when
debt service obligations are at their maximum. Furthermore, an increase
in real-term production costs can be expected because of the high fuel cost
component in the production and transportation costs. For most iron ore mines
(as well as for the larger projects presently under consideration), the fuel
component amounts to up to 25% of their direct production cost, which implies
that for every 4% increase in real-term fuel prices, an increase of 1% in
real-term iron ore production costs can be expected. These increases in
real-term production costs are expected to be reflected in the iron ore prices
also.
4.10      Future CIF as well as FOB iron ore prices are thus forecast to
increase in real terms over the long term from the presently depressed levels,



- 17 -
such increases however, being limited by the potential oversupply situation.
In particular, it has been assumed that--after the sharp drop in real-term iron
ore prices in 1981, particularly in Europe, caused by the crisis in the steel
industry (prices remained constant in current terms on the European market
whereas the inflation in 1980 was 12.5%)--prices will recover in 1982 to the
pre-1981 level. Because 1980 prices were somewhat above the long-term trend,
it has been assumed that the 1982 price will recover to a level which would
still be below the 1980 price, corresponding to the average real-term price for
the period 1979-81. Thereafter, prices are expected to increase by an average
of 0.5% per year until 1985 and 1% per year from 1986 to 1990. As a result,
the European market iron ore prices are expected to recover to their 1980 level
by 1988. The index of projected iron prices on the European market is given
below. 1/

C. Market for NIOC Products
4.11      NIOC has produced until 1979, and will produce after project
implementation, three different products with the following average chemical
composition:
NIOC--Iron Ore Product Charactistics a/
X Fe      X SiO2       % Al2 03      % Moisture
Mano II Fines         57.5        4.5           4.5             10-11
Blast Furnace Feed   53-55        3.5           6.9             8-10

a!   Natural state.
During the last two years, NIOC's operational difficulties provoked a drop in
the quality of its ore, with the average iron content falling in 1981 by 10%
below the above specifications. With the rehabilitation project, however, it
is expected that the quality will gradually improve and by 1984 will be at
1/   The assumptions hereabove relate to the European market only.  On the
Japanese market, since the drop in real terms in 1981 was substantially
smaller than on the European market (drop of 5% as opposed to 11% in
Europe) the real-term price increases expected for 1982-83 are expected
to be much smaller.



- I S - 
the level it was until 1979. I/ Mano II fines account for 85-90% of NIOC's
total production and the balance is evenly split between the other two products.
Siliceous fines are reclaimed from old tailings ponds and, as opposed to the
other two products9 are not produced in the beneficiation plant and therefore
will not be affected by the rehabilitation project.
4.12      Because of their particular characteristics illustrated in the table
above and especially because of their silica/alumina content, NIOC products,
as noted previously, must be considered as specialty products which are used
by steelworks for very specific uses. Mano II fines are used primarily as
grading material for sinter feed. They are mixed in the sinter phase with
higher-quality ore (i.e., higher iron and lower silica/alumina content) in
order to reach the optimum levels of the flux media (silica) and slag (of
which alumina is an integral component). This is needed to ensure proper
physical and chemical conditions in the blast furnace. The Mano II fines are
also used as a binding agent in pellet feed as a substitute for bentonite.
The siliceous fines are used as a grading material in sinter feeds. The blast
furnace feed--a coarse product--is fed directly into the blast furnace in
combination with high-grade material or it is ground to sinter feed.
4.13      There is a particular market niche in Europe for NIOC products or
for products with similar characteristics. Indeed, the European steel
producers are now, and will be in the future, highly dependent on imported
iron ore. As these ores are all of high-grade quality, NIOC's or similar
products are needed for grading purposes. Indeed, to make up for the low
silica/alumina content in the high-grade ores, the high silica/alumina ores
are mixed with these in different proportions and grades, depending on the
steelworks and their ore supplies/blends. According to NIOC's marketing
agent, Caemi (para. 4.14), there is at present a market in Europe of about
4-5 million ltpy for high silica/alumina-type ores, essentially sinter fines.
NIOC's major competitor in this market is Robe River (Australia), which
produces a similar ore. However, considering the difference in sea freights
to Europe between West Africa and Australia, NIOC is very competitive and
there should be no constraints to NIOC increasing its market share. Caemi is
confident that, notwithstanding the future fluctuations in the world seaborne
iron ore demand/supply situation, demand for NIOC's products will remain
strong. The specific steps taken to secure the market are discussed below.

the following index:

D.   Marketing Arrangements and Sales Contracts
4.14      The sales agent for NIOC is Caemi International BV, located in the
Hague, Holland. Caemi International is the trading arm of Companhia Auxiliar
de Empresas de Mineracao, a well-known Brazilian industrial conglomerate
with interests in mining, steel, paper, machinery and forestation. 1/ They
have a good reputation in the international trade of iron ore and are considered
businesslike and knowledgeable. Caemi has been able, over the years, to place
all of NIOC s production and to obtain from NIOC's clients their agreement to
take all quantities corresponding to contractual arrears which, as of end-1980,
amounted to 13.6 million tons. NIOC has agreed that Caemi or an able marketing
agent acceptable to the Bank will be retained.
4.15      NIOC's products have been marketed through both short-term (one-to-
three year) and long-term (ten-year) sales contracts to about six different
European steel producers. The siliceous fines have been marketed in the frame
of a barter deal with a steel company against rail produced by that company.
The short-term contracts, in the past, have been extended with provisions for
annual price and quantity negotiations. The long-term contracts which NIOC
presently has are due to expire in 1983-84; however, Caemi has been successful
in obtaining letters of intent from five of NIOC's six major long-term customers
explicitly stating the customers willingness to receive the 13.6 million tons
of arrears under current contracts and their intention to negotiate new long-
term contracts with similar annual quantities totalling 3.25 million tons of
Mano II fines. Copies of these letters have been received by the Bank. Also,
the steel company presently purchasing the siliceous fines has expressed its
desire to replace the barter arrangement which is to expire end of 1981 by a
regular long-term sales contract. On the basis of such assurances and of the
strength of the market for NIOC's products, the marketing of NIOC's production
is not considered to pose any problem.
E.   Pricing of NIOC Ore
4.16      In the past, the price of NIOC ore was negotiated with the steel
companies on the basis of a fixed FOB Monrovia price, valid for five years.
Starting in 1979, however, NIOC negotiated with its clients to change these
procedures for the fines and blast feed and agreed to adopt the current
practice in the trade, i.e., an annually negotiated price in US cents/Fe
unit based on the CIF Rotterdam price for large iron ore producers. In 1979,
there was still a difference of about US2.5U/Fe unit between the Brazilian
ore CIF price and the NIOC CIF price, but this difference disappeared in 1980.
Although no commitment on price can be obtained from the ore buyers, it is
expected that there will be no significant difference in the future between
CIF US/Fe unit prices for NIOC's fines and blast feed and the price for large
1/ The Bank has had previous experience with Caemi. A Caemi subsidiary,
Mineracoes Brasileiras Reunidas SA (MBR), produces iron ore from its
Aguas Claras mine in Brazil, which was financed by the Bank under Loan
787-BR, approved in July 1971.

iron ore producers except for minor penalties which NIOC must bear because of
the higher moisture content of its ore. It is noteworthy in this context
that, while most deliveries of NIOC products have been below the contracted
specifications in the last two years, the customers whose contracts contain
penalty clauses have hardly ever exercised their rights in this respect. Also,
the present purchaser of NIOC's siliceous fines has expressed its willingness
to increase the price for these to about US15J/Fe unit (in 1980 terms) which
is about 25% higher than the fixed price of US$5 per ton (unrelated to the
price per Fe unit) on which the barter deal was based. Finally, in the case
of sales of NIOC products to local steel works, 1/ agreement will be sought
during negotiations that NIOC will not sell at a price below the FOB price
based on the CIF Rotterdam price obtainable for ore of similar characteristics.
4.17      Price projections for NIOC ore which are based on the general world
market price projection discussed in para. 4.10 and on the characteristics of
NIOC products discussed in para. 4.11 are as follows:

V. THE PROJECT
A.   Scope and Objectives
1.   Summary
5.01      The basic objectives of the project are to increase both run-of-mine
and beneficiated ore output, reduce operating costs, and improve infrastruc-
1/   Presently Liberia does not have any steel industry; however, the possi-
bility of building a steel mill eventually has been considered by the
Liberian Government.

tural facilities (bridge, railroad) so that NIOC can recover from a virtually
bankrupt situation and continue operating. This will provide benefits to the
economy through increased Government revenues, and employment in an area with
no alternative opportunities. There are adequate proven ore reserves for
at least 12 years' operation at the increased level of production (after
completion of the rehabilitation). The additional probable reserves which
have already been identified could very likely extend the life of the mine for
another 5 years. The concentrating plant output will be increased from the
present 2.3 million ltpy to 3.25 million ltpy with a recovery of 53%, implying
an increase in run-of-mine ore output from about 4.5 million ltpy to 6.1
million ltpy.
5.02      The major components of the project include additional mining
equipment (primarily shovels and trucks), a surge facility for crushed ore,
modification of the concentrator flowsheet, improvements to the 90-mile
railroad to Monrovia, repair of the St. Paul River railway bridge, and
miscellaneous support equipment. An important component of the project is
project management and technical/engineering assistance to improve the
operations of the Company.
5.03      The Bank has played a key role in assisting NIOC and the Government
to prepare the project, by (i) advising on the definition of the technical
scope of the project; (ii) advising on the refinancing of the Company and the
financing plan for the project; and (iii) providing in 1979 a US$500,000 PPF
advance to the Government to finance consulting studies and engineering work
to define project scope, design and viability. These studies included:
(i)  An evaluation of the condition of the St. Paul River railway
bridge and the preliminary engineering of the repair works by
Raymond Technical Services (US)--this work was completed in
December 1979;
(ii)  preliminary metallurgical testing to evaluate the adequacy of
the modification of the concentrating plant flowsheet by British
Steel (UK)-this work was completed in December 1979; and
(iii)  preparation of a preliminary mine plan and basic engineering for
the mining and concentrating equipment and railroad rehabilitation,
including estimates of capital and operating costs, by Met Chem
Consultants Limited (Canada)-a preliminary report was issued
in February 1980 and this work was completed in October 1980.
Copies of the final reports of these studies are available in the Project File.
In addition, in February 1981, a second US$500,000 PPF advance was granted to
the Government to finance detailed engineering of the bridge repair as well as
the legal assistance required in the setting up of the various financial and
other arrangements.
2.   Ore Reserves
5.04      The ore is derived from the intensive laterite weathering of the
original metamorphoseal banded iron formation. The ore bodies stand as topo-
graphic highs, capping the major hills in the area because of the insolubility
of the iron oxides in the weathering zone compared with the adjacent country



22 -
rock. The hills are rather gently rolling and the ore bodies are easily
accessible.
5.05      The latest ore reserve calculation made by NIOC was in March 1976
and proven reserves were estimated at 93.6 million tons. All available
geological information has been reviewed by the consultants Met Chem and, by
deduction of ore produced since March 1976 and by adding new reserves proven
in "E" Hill by a drilling campaign in early 1980, the proven reserves 1/ as
of June 1980 are as follows:
NIOC--Proven Iron Ore Reserves
('000 tons)
Reserves          Average % Fe
"I" Hill           8,190               50.1
"J" Hill           5,727               50.9
"H" Hill          31,387               51.2
"A" Hill          20,354               50.6
"E" Hill          20,248               53.1
Total          85,906               51.4
The stripping ratio--i.e., tons of ore per one ton of waste/overburden
material--is estimated at a favorable 5.8. In addition to proven reserves,
the Met Chem consultants estimate probable/possible reserves at 24 million
tons with a similar iron content. These estimates are based on scarce geo-
logical information but, because of past experience and the uniformity of
the geology in the area, the estimate is considered conservative.
5.06      Three different ore types (Types I, II and III) have been identi-
fied, and are currently being used in day-to-day mine planning. The need for
a classification of reserves into different ore types was recognized when the
"Mano II" plant flowsheet was developed and an effort to that effect was made
by German consultants (Exploration und Bergbau). However, the result of that
effort was discarded by NIOC management for several years because basic
geological information was not considered to be adequately representative for
the ore bodies. In conjunction with the ore reserve computation in 1976, NIOC
undertook to classify reserves in "A" Hill based on new drilling results. At
the Bank's request, an attempt to classify "H" Hill was made by NIOC in 1980.
5.07      Today "A" Hill and "H" Hill, together constituting 60% of proven
reserves, are the only ore bodies classified by ore type to the extent that
the data could serve as a base for long-term mining plans. This classification
has shown that an adequate mix of the three ore types exists in those hills
to ensure an adequate feed to the plant. The detailed classification of the
remaining 40% of proven reserves will be undertaken as part of the project.
Although the Met Chem consultants do not consider the classification to
be critical to the operation of the pre-washing plant after rehabilitation
and modification to the flowsheets, improvements in terms of more basic
ore quality data are necessary to ensure proper mine planning and will be
implemented as part of the project. An extensive drilling program will be

carried out for which new drills and compressors will be purchased (para.
5.08). A program of 1,142,300 ft was recommended by the consultants in their
report. NIOC has agreed that a detailed drilling program be established no
later than March 31, 1982 and implemented as soon as the additional drilling
equipment is available but no later than December 31, 1982.
3. Mine Improvements
5.08      The project will focus on improvement of several areas in the mine.
The current unreliability and low availability (below 40%) of shovels and
trucks hamper operations and are uneconomical. Old equipment has to be
scrapped and new equipment purchased to enable NIOC to increase output and
to lower operating costs. Two new shovels and six 50-ton trucks will be
purchased. For the purpose of improving road construction/maintenance and
bench preparation, two new bulldozers and one new grader are necessary.
Improved road maintenance, in combination with new trucks, will make the
operation less vulnerable to heavy rains and thus improve performance during
the rainy season. New compressors and drills will be provided to enable
NIOC to collect sufficient rock samples needed for short-term as well as
long-term production planning.
5.09      Strengthening of NIOC's mine planning capabilities is also an
important aspect of the mine improvements. In addition to the provision
of drilling equipment mentioned above, the project will also provide for a
substantial strengthening of NIOC's mine planning capabilities. As part of
the studies done by Met Chem, a preliminary long-term mine plan has been
prepared. In addition, during the project implementation period, NIOC has
agreed to prepare--with the assistance of a mine planning specialist provided
by Met Chem--a more detailed long-term mining plan, detailing year by year the
quantity, type and grade of ore to be mined from each hill. In addition, a
medium-term mining plan covering the next five years will also be prepared
showing in more detail the benches which will be mined and the access roads to
be used. These plans will be based on new detailed cross sections which will
be prepared on the basis of existing cross sections, complemented by the data
provided by the extensive drilling program to be undertaken (para. 5.07).
Finally, annual mining plans for the next two years detailing the location of
each shovel and the exact tonnages to be mined from each location will also
be prepared. It is expected that the combined effect of carefully prepared
mining plans and the availability of reliable mining equipment will drasti-
cally improve the mining operations and will enable the mine to increase its
output from 2.9 million tons of run-of-the mine production in 1980 to 6.1
million tons by 1983, as well as to lower costs. However, the mine planning
effort will have to remain a continuous one. In addition to the prepara-
tion of the annual mining plans, after project implementation NIOC will review
on a continuous basis both the long-term and the medium-term mining plans
prepared during the project implementation period.
4.   Beneficiation Plant Improvements
5.10      The main objectives of the project regarding the beneficiation plant
are to (i) make the plant less dependent on production disturbances in the
mine through the installation of surge facilities between the crusher and the



24 
plant, and vice versa, and to increase plant throughput of raw ore from 2.9
million tons in. 1980 to 6.1 million tons in 1983 and thereafter; (ii) improve
current iron recovery from the run-ot-mine ore by concentrator flow-sheet
improvements; and (iii) lower operating costs by replacing old, high-main-
tenance equipment with more modern. and efficient equipment and by reducing
plant water consumption. The surge facility requirements have been evaluated
by two independent consultants, and the final solution consists of a closed
storage bin arrangement, located adjacent to the plant facility, which will
store crushed ore and act as a buffer between the mine/crusher station and the
plant. The second objective, to improve recovery, will be achieved by the
installation of a second spiral circuit as well as by more appropriate and
efficient concentrating equipment, e.g., sizers, jigs. A number of consult-
ants- studies have confirmed these measures and it is believed that recovery
could be increased from the current 50% to 53%. Operating and maintenance
costs will also be reduced by these improvements.
5.11      The power plant is presently running at full capacity, with about
40% of its output required for pumping water from the Mano River to the
process plant. With the higher planned throughput, the process water require-
ment will increase. It has been decided to increase the power generating
capacity to meet this need by equipping the existing diesel units with turbo-
chargers, which will result in about a 15% capacity increase. This, in
addition to the water recycling system which will be installed, will ensure
a sufficient water supply for the project.
5.  Railroad and Bridge Improvements
5.12      As long as LMC operated the mine in Bomi Hills (up to 1977), all
maintenance of NIOC rolling stock was done by LMC as well as the maintenance
of the 40 miles of railroad track between Bomi and Monrovia. The maintenance
of the 50-mile track between Mano River and Bomi has always been the respon-
sibility of NIOC.  When LMC closed down the operation of Bomi Hills, NIOC was
left with a railroad on which maintenance had been severely neglected and
some immediate measures are required to reduce the risk of a major derailment
to an acceptable level. The proposed project comprises relaying 6.25 miles
of mainline track and a general track rehabilitat on program requiring about
60,000 crossties to be changed and about 75,000 m  of ballast for trackbed
improvement. In order to cope with the increased maintenance program, new
track maintenance equipment such as a tie changer, tie handler, track liner,
track gang cars and trailers will be purchased. The current number of ore
cars in service (170) is insufficient to undertake the future traffic and
new ore car trucks, brake rigging sets, hopper doors and steel side plates
will be purchased to improve the condition of operational cars as well as to
overhaul and put into service a minimum of 40 presently broken-down ore cars.
Additional tools will be acquired for both loco and car shops. A buffer
stock will be installed at the plant to increase flexibility of railroad
operations.
5.13      The above-water structure of the railroad bridge crossing the St.
Paul River is in good condition, but scouring and corrosion of the piers
under the water line have reached such a stage that remedies in the near



- 25 -
future are necessary to prevent a collapse of the bridge. Temporary repairs
of the most damaged pier were undertaken in October-November 1979 by NIOC. A
major rehabilitation of all piers is however required and will be undertaken
under the proposed project by a specialized contractor under NIOC supervision
(Met Chem) as proposed in a study by Raymond Technical Facilities Inc. of the
US (Project File). These should give the bridge at least a further 20
years' life. Agreement will be sought from the Government that Met Chem will
be employed to supervise the rehabilitation of the bridge.
6. Management and Technical Assistance
5.14      Project management is a crucial component of the NIOC rehabilitation
project and is necessary for the efficient overall operation of NIOC as well.
Following the exodus of key managerial and technical staff (para. 3.09), and
with the realization that timely recruitment of sufficiently qualified expa-
triate staff would at best be very difficult, a management and technical
services agreement (a copy of which is available in the Project File) was
negotiated and concluded with Met Chem to provide the key personnel required
to implement the project, as well as to manage the over-all operations of
the mine, until suitable candidates for these key managerial functions on a
long-term basis could be found and trained. As a condition of loan effective-
ness, Met Chem will be appointed manager of operations and will provide about
ten experienced expatriate technicians, including a General Manager. Met
Chem-s extensive experience in managing iron ore mining projects, in Canada,
in the US and in developing countries, as well as the possibility for Met Chem
to draw upon the expertise available in US Steel---of which Met Chem is a fully
owned subsidiary-makes it a most qualified firm for such an assignment. In
addition, Met Chem's previous involvement with NIOC (para. 5A03(iii)) provided
Met Chem with the in-depth knowledge of the company and the project which is
required for accepting and successfully carrying out such an assignment.
5.15      The management and technical services agreement covers the project
implementation period of 18 months (para. 5.26) and one year of operations
thereafter. The full 10-member management team will not, however, remain
for the entire period. Some members will be replaced after about one year,
as and when adequate replacements are hired and trained, although the General
Manager and the Financial Controller are expected to remain for the full
contract period. Thereafter, NIOC and Met Chem may negotiate to renew Met
Chem's services for an extended time. NIOC has agreed to retain Met Chem
for at least the full 30-month period covered by the contract and will agree
with the Bank on the appropriateness of retaining Met Chem or another form of
management assistance beyond this period.
5.16      Met Chem-s services cover two separate areas, the first being provi-
sion of management services for operations, and the second being management
and technical assistance to undertake and supervise the proposed rehabilita-
tion project. These two tasks will require about 380 man-months. In the
first area, Met Chem will manage all aspects of the operations--mine, plant
and infrastructure--under the supervision of the Executive Committee (para.
3.10). As project manager, Met Chem will monitor and supervise the imple-
mentation of the rehabilitation program by: (i) providing managerial and



- 26 -
technical support as well as detailed engineering and design; (ii) arranging
for procurement of all equipment and services needed to rehabilitate the
mine, plant and railroad; and (iii) carrying out cost control and accounting
functions. Met Chem will prepare a detailed mine plan and manning tables as
well as schedules for production and maintenance. Another important function
is the recruitment and training of replacement personnel to prepare for a
transition of managerial control at the conclusion of Met Chem's services.
A detailed description of Met Chem's services as project manager is given in
para. 5.22.
5.17      The cost of Met Chem services is in line with costs of similar
assignments worldwide. The estimated average cost per man-month is US$12,000
including salaries and all reimbursable expenses, and the total cost over
the 30-month period is estimated at about US$5.4 million (including some
engineering work needed for the project). Included in this amount, during
the first year of operations following the rehabilitation period, NIOC has
agreed to pay royalties based on the production level achieved. If production
equals 100% of the planned production of 3.25 million ltpy, the royalty would
amount to US$340,000 but would drop to zero should production fall below 95%
of the projected production. Further, if production were less than 85% of
planned production levels, Met Chem would pay NIOC a penalty equal to their
know-how fee of US$220,000. Thus, although the contracted fee appears
substantial, there are sufficient incentives for Met Chem to perform well.
Considering the difficulties in finding individuals or firms capable and
willing to undertake this task in Liberia at this time, this arrangement is
considered appropriate and advantageous for the project.
7.   Economic Development Studies
5.18      In order to facilitate the development of alternative employment
opportunities in the region which will be needed when mining operations
cease as reserves are depleted, the proposed project includes a preliminary
economic development study of the area comprising a survey and evaluation of
employment opportunities in Western Liberia and outlining steps to be taken
to develop employment potential. This study, to be undertaken by consultants,
is only a first and very preliminary step in the Government's effort to
diversify the economic base of the Mano River area and to prepare for the
eventual closure of the mine. The Consultants will be hired no later than
December 31, 1982.
B.   Environmental Effects and Safety
5.19      The major environmental effects of the Company's operations are
the scarring of the terrain through the open pit mining operations and the
pollution of the Mano River (which forms the border between Liberia and
Sierra Leone). The pollution of the river is caused by the direct dumping
of tailings into a ditch, running through full tailings ponds to a small
creek discharging into the river, the result being a heavily discolored (red)
river. A proper tailings handling system, with tailings ponds for settling
of the solids, was in operation until about 1973. All existing ponds were
then filled up and the construction of a new pond was started but never
completed. In 1978, MMAL commissioned a review of this situation which



- 27 -
resulted in a report entitled Effluent Flocculation Study of Mine Tailings
(Project File). The proposed project will correct the pollution problem
through the installation of a tailings handling system, which would meet
acceptable environmental requirements. This would involve completion of the
new pond and construction of pipelines and/or launders. Also the thickener,
to be installed as parS of the water reclamation system, will lower the total
amount of solids per m to be pumped to the pond, and therefore it is expected
that the excess water from the pond will be free from settling solids and
that the discoloring of the river will be greatly reduced. If that is still
not satisfactory, flocculants could be added to improve the water quality
further. Assurances have been obtained that the amount of solids in the
settling ponds overflowing to the river will be continuously monitored and
that adequate corrective measures (including the use of flocculants) will be
taken to keep this amount at an acceptable level, in line with World Bank
guidelines.
5.20      Land reclamation plans have not been finalized as yet.  Indeed
mining is currently taking place in four hills and a fifth hill, "E" Hill,
will be opened up in the near future. Because of the need for selective
mining in order to maintain an even plant feed, mining will continue to take
place in at least three hills simultaneously. In the absence of a well-
prepared long-term mining plan, it is impossible to say when, where and to
what extent it would be prudent to start appropriate land reclamation arrange-
ments at any of the presently-mined hills. Furthermore, as there is a strong
likelihood that mining in the area will continue beyond the estimated 13 years
of proven reserves, land reclamation operations will have to be considered at
a later date. This will be known as the drilling program progresses, most
like1v b- end-1983. Once a final long-term mining plan has been made, NIOC
will prepare and submit to the Bank no later than December 31, 1982, a plan for
land reclamation and will implement this plan in a timely fashion thereafter.
5.21      Although NIOC has in the past adapted adequate rules to ensure
workers safety, it has been noted that in practice these are not enforced.
The number of workers accidents has increased in the recent past as a result
of less supervision, as well as deteriorated equipment. With the implementa-
tion of the rehabilitation project, the improvement in the equipment condition
and the strengthening of management, this situation is expected to improve.
Furthermore, under the terms of reference of the management contract, the
management team financed under the project will review NIOC's safety rules and
will ensure that adequate attention will be paid to the observance of modern
safety rules.
C.   Project Implementation
1.   Project Management and Organization
5.22      Under the Management and Technical Assistance Agreement Met Chem
will provide services related to (i) management of NIOC's day-to-day opera-
tions, and (ii) technical assistance, including project management, for the
implementation of the rehabilitation project. As project manager, Met Chem
will set up a project implementation unit to monitor and supervise the reha-
bilitation program and will report to the General Manager. The proposed
organization of the Met Chem project implementation unit is shown in Chart
5-1. The unit will consist of a full-time project manager and about eight Met

Chem specialists, who will be involved for varying periods of time providing
support either in the field or from the home offices in Montreal. The follow-
ing services will be provided in connection with the implementation of the
project:
(i) implementation of procedures for project control, cost
control and scheduling;
(ii) soil investigation of the overburden and rock conditions
in the proposed surge bin area and possible thickener area;
(iii) surveying and preparation of quantity calculations for
excavation and earthwork for construction specifications
at the plant, railroad and tailings area;
(iv) both basic and detailed engineering design of all modifications
as well as preparation of specifications for new equipment;
(v) supervision of all subcontracts, e.g., contracts for the repair
of the St. Paul River bridge, delivery and installation of turbo-
chargers and switch gears in the power plant, and the manufacture
and delivery of surge bin facilities;
(vi)  supervision of NIOC personnel and local contractors for erection
of surge bin facilities including civil works, railway track
improvements, and plant modifications including structural work,
construction of thickeners and the tailings dam;
(vii) testing for development of a water balance and the design and
supervision of testing on the action of various flocculants;
(viii) procurement services; and
(ix) supervision of trial runs and commissioning of equipment.
5.23      In addition to services directly related to the physical imple-
mentation of project facilities, immediate technical assistance is required
in crucial areas of the operation. Such assistance will comprise (i) imple-
mentation of a program for proper short- and long-term mine planning using
NIOC personnel and instructing the Mine Department in the effective use of
the mine plans; (ii) recommendations regarding and supervision of required
test work in the beneficiation plant; and (iii) review of railway preventive
maintenance programs, shop equipment and layouts to determine immediate
improvements.
5.24      There are 30 identified procurement packages for this project:  1
management contract, 1 major construction contract: (bridge repair/civil works)
and 28 equipment packages. These packages are given in detail in Annex 5.



30 
5.25      The total local component constitutes about 11% of the installed
project cost. Of this, NIOC force account constitutes over 60%. The force
account component includes assets which NIOC already purchased (rails,
ballast, spirals) which are needed for the rehabilitation as well as local
transport and erection which will be handled by NIOC. In view of the small
volume of erection work, it appeared that it would not constitute an attrac-
tive contract for an outside contractor and could be undertaken by NIOC
directly.
2.   Schedule
5.26      The implementation period is estimated to be 18 months for the
rehabilitation of NIOC's facilities and 20 months for the rehabilitation of
the bridge from the commencement of final detailed engineering, as shown in
Chart 5-2. In addition, management assistance will be extended for a minimum
period of one year following the completion of the rehabilitation of NIOC's
facilities. Met Chem has guaranteed in the management contract that this
schedule will be met, although there is no financial penalty tied to this
guarantee other than the penalty of not being retained as managers for the
more lucrative operating period which follows the project implementation and
during which the royalty payments will be made by NIOC. The upgrading
of the railroad, and the construction of the ore surge facility are on the
critical path of the time schedule. Assuming that detailed engineering for
the surge facilities commences in December 1981, the physical completion of
the rehabilitation of NIOC should be achieved by July 1983. For the rehabil-
itation of the St. Paul River railway bridge the total implementation period
including engineering, selection of contractors and construction is expected
to be 20 months and is expected to be completed by August 1983. A detailed
implementation schedule will be prepared by Met Chem once on site. A summary
schedule is illustrated in Chart 5-2.
VI. CAPITAL COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN
A.   Capital Costs
6.01      The capital cost for the NIOC project is estimated at US$67.1
million, of which US$54.4 million in foreign exchange, as shown in the table
on page 32. A complete breakdown of these costs by procurement package is
given in Annex 5.

6.02      The costs of mining and miscellaneous equipment for the mine and
the plant are based on quotes obtained from suppliers in September 1981. A
contingency of 5% has been applied to mining equipment, maintenance equipment
and power plant switchgear, while a 10% physical contingency has been applied
to plant equipment. For the plant modification and construction of the surge
system, cost estimates are based on the preliminary engineering done by Met
Chem and contingencies of 25% and 30%, respectively, have been applied. For
the railroad repair, the bulk of the cost is foreign equipment, for which
budget quotes have been obtained from suppliers and to which a 10% physical
contingency has been applied. The local cost corresponding to the repair
work performed by NIOC, supplemented with additional local labor (para.
5.26), is based on estimates made by Met Chem based on the cost of maintenance
work currently done by NIOC. The estimated foreign cost of the management
contract is the contractual ceiling agreed upon between NIOC and Met Chem,
with an additional provision for reimbursables as estimated by Met Chem.
These costs cover the project implementation period as well as the cost of
managerial and technical assistance during the first year of operations
thereafter. A physical contingency of 10% has been applied to this item.
The cost estimate for the repair of the St. Paul River bridge is based on
preliminary engineering done by Raymond Technical and on a quotation pro-
vided by them. A physical contingency of 20% has been applied. Project
preparation costs are the costs of the feasibility and engineering studies,
as well as legal and consulting assistance, financed under the World Bank PPF
advance. The interest during construction estimates cover interest from
1981 to mid-1984. A provisional amount has been included for economic studies
(para. 5.18).
6.03      The base costs are in constant September 1981 dollars for all items
except the bridge rehabilitation which is in constant end-1980 dollars.
Price contingencies have been applied to these, assuming price increases for
equipment, construction and engineering of 9.0% in 1981, 8.5% in 1982 and 7.5%
in 1983 for both foreign and local expenditures.
6.04      The capital costs estimates have substantially increased during
the course of project preparation as it became clear that a major and all-
encompassing rehabilitation effort was needed to put NIOC on a sound footing.
In addition, the large management assistance component--representing about 8%
of the total cost--had to be added as a result of the shortage of managerial
staff resulting from the departure of senior staff in 1980 (para. 3.09).
Notwithstanding these increases, the base cost per annual ton of incremental
production capacity--which amounts to about US$22/annual ton (in 1980 US$)--
still compares very favorably with other iron ore mining projects under
consideration, as illustrated in the following table:

6.05      Of the total financing requirements of US$67.1 million, US$44.3
million would be used directly by NIOC for the rehabilitation of the mining
and concentrating facilities as well as the railroad, with US$8.3 million used
by the Government. As the bridge is Government-owned infrastructure, the
ultimate beneficiary of its rehabilitation is the Government. Also, it will
be implemented without any contribution from NIOC (other than payment of Met
Chem services for supervision of the contract, para. 5.13). Therefore, it is
justified that the Government carry the burden of this rehabilitation. NIOC
will compensate for the use of such bridge by servicing the debt contracted
by the Government for this rehabilitation from its cash generation. Although
the railroad is partly Government-owned infrastructure, because the rehabilita-
tion of this railroad as well as its maintenance will be undertaken by NIOC
personnel, it has been decided for practical reasons that the railroad would
be rehabilitated and maintained at the expense of the Company.
6.06      The foreign cost of the project--amounting to about US$54.4 million,
or 81% of the total project cost--will be financed through long-term loans,
US$4.1 million of the Government-s equity contribution of US$7.1 million and
US$8.5 million of commercial bank financing. The local cost will be financed
with US$3.0 million of Government equity and a limited contribution from NIOC
through force account work. The financing plan stands as follows:

6.07      The Government equity will finance interest during construction on
all loans except for the proposed Bank loans (para. 6.17) as well as US$3
million worth of working capital. Part of the Government equity (i.e., the
UTS$4.1 million for interest during construction) will thus be disbursed in
parallel with the long-term loans. The US$3 million equity contribution for
working capital has already been partly disbursed by the Government in late
1981 to cover NIOC immediate cash requirements (para. 3.22). Disbursement of
the full amount is a condition of loan effectiveness. In addition, the
Government will be asked to provide the additional funds needed to complete
the project in the case of a shortfall of funds.
6.08      NIOC's equity contribution corresponds mainly to force account work
(erection of the surge system, repair of the railroad) and rail, ballast and
equipment for the plant which have already been purchased by the Company over
the last two years in preparation for the rehabilitation project.
6.09      The proposed Bank contribution will be separated into two loans:  one
loan of US$8.3 million for the financing of the rehabilitation of the bridge
and studies, which will be made to the Government as the ultimate beneficiary
of this rehabilitation, and one loan of US$11.7 million to finance part of the
mine rehabilitation effort which will be made directly to NIOC. Both loans
would have a final maturity of 13 years (i.e., the proven life of the mine)
including 5 years grace and will carry the current Bank interest rate. (An
11.6% interest rate has been assumed for the financial projections.) They
will become effective upon effectiveness of all other loans for the



- 36 -
project. The Government has agreed to guarantee the loan to NIOC and NIOC
will pay a guarantee fee to the Government of 1.0%. The PPF advances totalling
US$1 million, which had been made to the Government and which are expected to
be fully disbursed by loan effectiveness, will be refinanced. About US$250,000
for studies done on the bridge and for legal assistance to the Government will
be refinanced under the loan to the Government, and US$750,000 will be re-
financed under the loan to the Company. NIOC is expected to have purchased
about US$1 million of spare parts included in the proposed project as well as
to have appointed and paid to Met Chem about US$200,000 before Loan signature.
It is proposed that these amounts be retroactively financed under the proposed
Loan.
6.10      The African Development Bank loan will be made to the Government
and on-lent to NIOC. The onlending terms are 8.5% interest and 14 years
including 5 years grace. The OPEC loan will be made to the Government for
on-lending to NIOC on terms similar to the Bank. The loan from the FMO will
be made directly to the Company on terms of 9% interest and 14 years including
4 years grace.
6.11      In addition to the long-term financing requirements outlined above,
NIOC-s critical financial situation and the projected cash losses for 1981 and
beginning of 1982 made it necessary to secure approximately US$14.5 million
of commercial financing to cover NIOC-s cash shortfalls. These funds, to be
provided by a syndicate of commercial banks which will become effective in
parallel with the Bank loan, will carry an interest charge of 1.5% over LIBOR.
The repayment terms of these loans have been set so that the commercial
lenders are expected to be repaid by end-1987. The American International
Group (AIG) has agreed to insure the loans up to 90% for a premium of 3%.
Finalization of these arrangements and effectiveness of the commercial banks
loans is a condition of loan effectiveness.
6.12      Finally, the last element in the financial structuring of the
project, the rescheduling of NIOC-s existing long-term and short-term debt--
amounting to about US$16.4 million at the end of 1980--has been negotiated
with its existing creditors (agreement in principle has been obtained). The
Government has already agreed to convert US$5.3 million of debt into equity.
The US Ex-Im Bank has been asked to reschedule its existing loans which amount
to US$3.5 million into a long-term loan subordinated to those from the new
lenders. The other existing lenders related to the Christie interest, have
agreed in principle to convert their outstanding claims amounting to US$8
million 1/ into a US$3 million long-term loan subordinated to the new lenders.
The terms of both rescheduled long-term loans would be 14 years repayment,
including 6.5 years grace, bearing interest at 12%, and fully subordinated
to the new lenders for the rehabilitation project as well as to operational
requirements of the Company. Finalization of the rescheduling of existing
loans is a condition of loan effectiveness. NIOC has agreed not to make
1/   About US$1 million of this amount was questioned by NIOC and was not on
NIOC s books.



- 37 -
any payments of interest or principal on these loans before all obligations
to the new lenders are met and sufficient provisions have been made for the
operations of the Company, including both working capital and asset renewals.
Furthermore, NIOC has agreed not to make such payments unless certain finan-
cial covenants are met (para. 7.10).
C.    Trust Arrangements and Operational Sub-Account
6.13      To provide the lenders to the project with some security and to
ensure that NIOC operates on a sound financial basis, the proceeds from the
sale of iron ore will be allocated as a matter of first priority to debt
service payments, and as second priority, to finance day-to-day operations of
NIOC's mine-related facilities as well as necessary renewal investments. To
this effect, a trust account with different sub-accounts has been set up with
the Wilmington Trust Company (US) which has been selected by NIOC as trustee
and will become operational at the time of effectiveness of the long-term
loans for the project. NIOC will instruct the purchasers of its ore to make
all payments of sales proceeds directly to this account and is under the
obligation to so instruct future purchasers of ore (para. 6.14). All lenders
to the project, NIOC and the Wilmington Trust Company will simultaneously
enter into a trust agreement upon effectiveness of the long-term loans. The
ADB, which intends to lend to the Government for on-lending to NIOC, will also
be a party to the agreement. Further, the Bank loan to the Government for the
bridge will be serviced directly from the trust account.
6.14      The trustee will be instructed to make retentions from the monthly
iron ore sales receipts equivalent to one sixth of the next semi-annual
payment due and to credit these to a lenders collective sub-accolnt.  In
addition, the trustee will ensure that, in such sub-account, there is at
all times the equivalent of one semi-annual payment as a cushion starting in
mid-1982. The trust agreement also provides for (i) an unconditional global
assignment to the trustee of all future sales proceeds from the sale of iron
ore, and (ii) specific assignments of sales proceeds under each iron ore
contract.
6.15      After the lenders sub-account has been credited, the trustee will,
starting at the end of the project implementation period, credit to a work-
ing capital sub-account on a monthly basis the amounts required by NIOC to
operate, as determined by detailed annual budgets For NIOC's anticipated
operating expenses. This working capital sub-account will be prefunded with
a cushion equivalent to one month of monthly expenditures. This cushion will
be built up during the six months following the end of the project implemen-
tation period (until end-1983) by cash generated by NIOC. Funds from this
working capital sub-account will be transferred by the trustee to a NIOC
checking account at NIOC's request. However, in order to monitor the use
of these funds, after implementation of the project and once the cushion is
built up, the trustee will not be allowed to make any such transfers without
approval of the lenders if, as a result, the total amount of funds in the



- 38 -
working capital account would fall below two weeks of projected expendi-
tures. 1/ Once the working capital account is credited, the trustee will
use the remaining funds to credit an asset renewal sub-account held by the
trustee, according to an asset renewal budget submitted by NIOC. The balance
of the funds will be transferred by the trustee to an account in the name of
NIOC for use in payment of taxes and repayment of existing loans.
6.16      The mechanism described above will provide security to the lenders
by ensuring that the funds provided from iron ore sales be used in priority
to repay the lenders. Through the system of automatic transfers it will also
ensure that no payments are made by NIOC before enough funds have been set
aside for working capital and asset renewal purposes. In addition, in the
case of a cash shortfall, the one-month working capital cushion will enable
NIOC to face temporary shortfalls in sales, as it will provide NIOC with time
to consult with the lenders to find a solution to such shortfalls.
D.   Allocation of Bank Loan and Disbursement Schedule
6.17      The proposed Bank loan to the Government will finance the following
items: (i) the rehabilitation of the St. Paul River bridge, (ii) the economic
study, (iii) interest during construction on the loan, and (iv) engineering
studies for the bridge and legal assistance to the Government financed under
the PPF advance and refinanced under the proposed loan. The proposed Bank
loan to the Company will finance: (i) the management and technical assistance
contract with Met Chem including the first operational year following rehabili-
tation, (ii) spare parts, (iii) interest during construction on the loan, and
(iv) the various engineering and feasibility studies for NIOC financed under
the PPF advance. The Bank loans would finance the foreign exchange components
of these items except for the bridge, for which it is proposed that the Bank
finance the totality of the contract including a local component estimated at
US$1.4 million. The financing of interest during construction is justified in
view of the cash shortage affecting both the Government and NIOC.
6.18      The contractor for the bridge rehabilitation will be selected
through international competitive bidding. Raymond Technical Facilities Inc.
having prepared the bridge rehabilitation scheme will not be invited to bid.
The spare parts will be procured in several packages still to be defined
with the assistance of Met Chem, most of which are expected to be procured
on a sole source basis. Met Chem as well as the consultants for the various
engineering and feasibility studies and for the legal assistance have been
selected by NIOC with the approval of the Bank.
1/   This corresponds to about US$1.2 million by end-1982 and will increase
to about US$4.3 million by end-1993.

6.19      The allocation of the Bank loans will be as follows:
Allocation of Bank Loans
(US$ Million)
A - Loan to NIOC
1.  100% of foreign expenditures for management consultants                   5.4

2.  100% of foreign expenditures for consultant services                      0.3

6.20      The Bank loans are expected to be disbursed according to the follow-
ing schedule. Because of the particular nature of the items financed by the
Bank, these schedules are somewhat different from the reference disbursement
schedules normally used for mining projects or for projects in Liberia. For
the loan to NIOC, the disbursements for spare parts and the management contract
are spread more or less evenly over the project implementation period whereas
the interest during construction is paid during the II and IV quarters of the
fiscal year.    For the loan to Government the disbursement schedule follows
the normal profile for civil works adapted to take into account the short
implementation period and the interest during construction payments.

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Production Build-Up and Sales
7.01      The rehabilitation of NIOC's operations is designed to increase iron
ore production from the average 2.2 million ltpy produced over the last five
years to 3.25 million tpy by 1983 through 1994. Based on the detailed
implementation schedule (Chart 5-2), the following production/sales build-up
is expected:
NIOC--Post-Rehabilitation Production/Sales Build-Up
(Million long tons)
1981     1982      1983    1984-94
Mine Output a/         2.25      3.40      5.28     6.13
Plant Output b/        1.17      1.80     2.80      3.25
Sales c/               1.17      1.80     2.72      3.25
a/   Run-of-mine grade iron ore.
b/ Assumes 53% recovery rate.
c/   Excluding siliceous fines.
In its contract, Met Chem has committed itself to achieve the targets of 6.13
million ltpy run-of-mine and 3.25 million ltpy of saleable ore after completion
of the rehabilitation program; and the contract includes a strong incentive
for Met Chem to do so (para. 5.17). These targets are based on a 65-70%
availability factor for the equipment, a 78% utilization factor for the plant
and a 53% weight recovery factor, which factors are all based on the results
achieved in 1979. As some improvement to these can be expected as a result
of the rehabilitation, the 3.25 million ltpy assumed is considered as a
conservative and achievable production estimate for this project. The pro-
duction build-up is expected to be achievable considering that this is a
rehabilitation of an existing operation as opposed to the start-up of a new
one. In particular, the supply of new mining equipment (mainly trucks) will
have an immediate impact on production levels. Projected sales revenues are
based on this production build-up and the average selling prices projected in
Chapter IV (para. 4.17).
B.   Operating Costs
7.02      The cost of goods sold is expected to decrease as a result of
the rehabilitation as illustrated in the following table:



- 41 -
a!
Cost of Goods Sold Per Ton-
(1980 US$ terms)
Actual                Projected
1979      1982    1983    1984    1994
Ore Production (000 tons) b/         2,370      1,800   2,800   3,250   3,250
Cost per ton ($)                      8.66       8.60    7.54    7.09    7.61
a/   Excluding depreciation.
b/   Excluding siliceous fines.
Direct production costs per ton are expected to decrease in constant terms
from the 1979 level 1/ by about US$1.50/ton by the time the rehabilitation
project is fully completed (i.e., by end-1983). This decrease results mainly
from economies of scale due to additional production (about US$1.00/ton)
and savings in truck hauling and shovel operating costs (about US$1.40/ton)
partly counter-balanced by projected cost increases in real terms (oil mainly)
equivalent to 13% in real terms or US$0.85/ton. Because of the difficult
financial situation at the mine, it has been assumed that no increase in real
terms of wage levels will be granted to the workers. As they are the main
beneficiaries of the rehabilitation effort, this assumption appears justified.
7.03      Indirect costs are expected to increase in real terms except for
general overhead costs which are expected to remain fairly constant. Selling
expenses or a constant proportion of 3.5% of sales revenues will increase with
sales volumes. Payment of a bridge toll fee to the Government, equivalent to
the interest and principal payments due on the debt contracted by the Govern-
ment to finance bridge rehabilitation, is planned starting in 1984. The cost
of the management contract--including royalties payable to Met Chem (para.
5.17)-is an additional indirect cost. Although the present contract covers
only a 30-month period, it is expected that additional costs for managerial
assistance might be incurred beyond this period.
7.04      NIOC's depreciation practices presently call for a fixed depreciation
amount per ton of finished product. This amount, which was fixed in the early
1970s, is totally unrelated to the actual cost of capital equipment and clearly
understated the depreciated state of NIOC's fixed assets. Therefore, it was
agreed that NIOC s depreciation practices will be revised by December 31, 1982,
according to modern accounting procedures.
1/   The cost per ton figures in 1980 and 1981 are not representative because
of the very low production levels in those years.



- 42 -
C.   Financial Projections and Future Profitability
7.05      The reduction in operating costs (in constant terms) mentioned
above, coupled with the slight increases in iron ore prices and the forecasted
additional output, is expected to restore the profitability of NIOC's operations.
The following table summarizes the projected financial performance of NIOC. The
assumptions used in projecting NIOC's future financial performance are given
in Annex 7-1. Detailed projected financial statements are given in Annexes
7-2 through 7-6.

7.06      From 1983 onwards, NIOC is expected to generate an annual profit
(before taxes) which will increase from less than US$0.6 million in 1983 (or
1.0% of sales revenues) to about US$27 million by 1994 (or 25% of sales reve-
nues). During project implementation, however, losses are still expected as a
result of the very low production levels. In 1982, these will amount to about
US$2.3 million after inclusion of US$4.0 million of exceptional profits
(writing off of existing debt). These losses, together with the repayment of
part of NIOC's outstanding obligations (mainly NIOC's payables), will result
in cash shortfalls of about US$14.5 million which will be financed with loans
from commercial banks (para. 6.11).
7.07      The cumulative cash surplus generated by NIOC will remain low
through 1991, mainly as a result of the large annual principal repayments
due to the short amortization periods of the loans as well as the repayment



- 43 -
of accrued taxes. The cumulative cash surplus--beyond the US$8 million which
will be held at all times in the trust account (paras. 6.13-6.16)-is expected
to be below US$6 million through 1991. Thereafter, once all accrued taxes
have been repaid and the debt service obligations start to diminish, the cash
surplus will increase quickly, resulting in a surplus estimated at about US$43
million by end-1994. Thereafter, if the probable reserves materialize as is
most likely, the Company will generate on average an annual cash surplus of
more than US$15 million (about 15% of sales revenues) increasing the estimated
total cash surplus to about US$127 million by end-1999.
7.08      Under the proposed project, taxes of general application will be
levied on the Company. During the 1982-87 period, taxes will accrue but will
not be payable in order to ensure that sufficient cash is available for NIOC
to repay the debt to commercial banks. Thereafter, annual taxes of 50% of
profit and accrued taxes--taking into account a loss carry-forward of five
years (i.e. the losses in 1981 and 1982 will be deducted from the profit)-will
be payable by NIOC. It has been agreed that no tax payment will be made until
all annual obligations to the new lenders are met and adequate provisions for
working capital and asset renewals are made. The security mechanism described
in paras. 6.13-6.16 has been set up to that effect. Furthermore, it has been
agreed that payment of taxes will be subject to certain financial criteria as
will be the payment of dividends from the remaining cash (para. 7.10).
7.09      The debt repayment schedule has been set up to minimize the financial
burden during the first years and to enable NIOC to accumulate and retain an
adequate security cushion in the trust account. This cushion--which will vary
from US$8 million to US$10 million depending on the year--will be held until
all senior debt is repaid, by 1994. Also, the debt repayment schedule is such
that the debt service coverage ratio on senior debt will be at all times above
1.5 (except for 1987). This ratio does not, however, take into account NIOC's
ability to satisfy the subordinated obligations (i.e., taxes and existing
debt servicing, paras. 6.12 and 7.10) which, in the case of a cash shortfall,
might not be met. The setting up of a trust account, the subordination of
taxes and existing debt and the projected senior debt service coverage ratio
provide adequate protection for the senior lenders. Furthermore, the Goverr-
ment has agreed to cover any cash shortfall which might occur to the extent
that these shortfalls would prevent NIOC from servicing the senior debt and/or
meeting its current working capital and asset renewal requirements (para. 9.03).
7.10      To ensure maintenance of a sound financial position and to safeguard
the position of the new lenders, the following covenants have been agreed:
(a) NIOC will not be permitted to pay any taxes, interest
and principal on subordinated debt, or dividends if, after
such payment, the current ratio (including the current
portion) would fall below 1.3:1 or the debt:equity ratio
excluding subordinated debt would be above 60:40. In any
case, NIOC will not pay any taxes before 50% of all debt
incurred for the project is repaid. Further, dividends
will not be payable until 75% of the debt for the project
is repaid;



- 44 -
(b) NIOC will maintain a current ratio of at least 1.3:1;
(c) NIOC will not incur any additional debt--beyond the debt
incurred for the financing of the project and the debt
incurred in 1981-82 with commercial banks for cash shortfall
financing--before 1987 without prior Bank approval and
thereafter if, as a result of such debt, the debt:equity
ratio would be above 60:40 or the projected debt service
coverage ratio on senior debt (i.e., excluding subordinated
debt) would be below 1.5; and
(d) before completion of the project, NIOC will not incur
any investments, other than those included in the rehabili-
tation project as defined in the consultants' report,
unless otherwise agreed with the Bank. In any given
year thereafter, capital investments (including renewals
expected to cost in the range of US$2.5-4.5 million per
year), will not in aggregate exceed US$5 million without
Bank approval.
D.   Auditing
7.11      Until 1979, the accounts which MMAL prepared for NIOC were audited
by a firm in the US. After MMAL's services were terminated, NIOC appointed a
major international firm, with a branch office in Liberia, to perform these
audits. Because of the major difficulties which NIOC has been facing, the
auditing of its 1980 accounts is still underway. Submission of 1980 audit
is a condition of loan effectiveness. Thereafter, NIOC will be required to
submit annual audited accounts to the Bank no later than four months after the
end of the fiscal year.
E.   Financial Rate of Return
7.12      The pre-tax financial rate of return for the project has been cal-
culated in real terms and is expected to be about 14.3%. This rises to 15.7%
when a longer mine life of 20 years is assumed. Assumptions made in the
calculation of the financial rate of return are given in Annex 7-7. While
moderate increases in capital costs would not cause the financial rate of
return to drop below 13%, they would, however, result in a need for additional
funds in 1982 and 1983 which, if provided by commercial banks, would put an
additional burden on NIOCs cash flow during the loan repayment period and
might result in a rescheduling of the commercial loans. The financial rate
of return and the cash flow are very sensitive to changes in sales revenues.
A temporary drop in sales revenues of one to two years (such as which could
result from a slower than expected recovery of iron ore prices) could be
covered by additional commercial bank borrowing during the project implementa-
tion period and later by NIOC's own cash flow, without jeopardizing NIOC's
financial situation. However, a permanent drop in sales revenues would result
in serious cash shortfalls, particularly from 1984 to 1987, creating the need
for additional equity funding. A detailed cash flow analysis shows that, in

the less favorable case, whereas the financial rate of return would be 8.1%,
an additional US$15 million to 17 million in new equity would be needed from
1984 to 1988 to cover the cash shortfalls. An alternative to additional
equity would be the rescheduling of the commercial banks loans in line with
the long-term project loans, which would limit the new equity requirements to
about US$6 million to US$8 million.
7.13      Delays in project implementation would not significantly affect the
rate of return. They would, however, have a serious impact on the Company's
cash flow during the critical first year. It is estimated that an extension
by six months of the project implementation period would cause a drop in
the projected cash generation of NIOC in 1983-84 totalling US$4 million to
US$5 million, which would have to be covered by additional equity or commer-
cial bank financing. Another adverse effect of delays in project implementa-
tion would be the impact of these on NIOC's market, especially in the very
short future. Indeed, if NIOC cannot produce sufficient ore in early 1982
to satisfy the minimum demand of its clients, it is possible that these
clients will turn to other suppliers. To limit this risk, the critical mining
equipment has already been ordered, the downpayment having been financed by
the Government, and is expected to arrive at the mine in early 1982.
7.14      An additional event which, although most unlikely, must be taken
into account in discussing the sensitivity of the project, is the occurrence
of a major accident on the railroad infrastructure (such as a collapse of the
St. Paul River Bridge) which would interrupt NIOC's shipments during a long
period. From a financial point of view, NIOC would be able to face (with addi-
tional external financing) the cash shortfalls resulting from a six to nine



- 46 -
month interruption in shipments without jeopardizing the overall financial
viability of the project. However as the impact of such an interruption on
NIOC s market, as well as on the ability of NIOC to retain its workers, in
particular the expatriates, cannot be foreseen, expeditious solutions to
reduce the length of any interruption in shipments would then have to be
adopted in order not to jeopardize NIOC's existence.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
8.01      The justification for rehabilitating NIOC's iron ore operations
is two-fold: (i) in the short term, the project prevents the negative socio-
economic impact which a mine closure would cause in an area with no other
modern economic activity; and (ii) in the longer term, the project will help
to maintain economic stability by lessening the erosion of Liberia's iron ore
revenues, which, in turn, can be used to prepare for the eventual mine closure
once iron ore reserves are depleted. The economic importance of the project
far exceeds its direct financial benefits to NIOC and the Government as
illustrated by its high economic rate of return of 26.5%.
A.   Short-Term Benefits
1.   Employment and Socio-Economic Stability
8.02      Without the rehabilitation project, the NIOC iron ore operations
would be forced to close down before the end of the year because of lack of
funds to maintain its operation. The immediate effect of a mine closure would
be loss of employment for about 2,000 workers. It is estimated that less than
10% of these workers would be able to find other meaningful employment and
that about 90% would have little choice but to turn to bush farming. As a
consequence, a population estimated at 16-18 thousand people, who are presently
directly or indirectly supported by the mine, would lose its main means of
livelihood and would return to subsistence living.
8.03      The Government is keenly aware of the serious socio-economic distur-
bances which would result from a mine closure. In 1977, when the Bomi Hills
iron ore operations shut down, the Government was unable to alleviate the
subsequent unemployment and socio-economic instability which resulted. As no
alternative employment opportunities in the modern sector existed in the Bomi
Hills area, some of the mine workers migrated to Monrovia in search of jobs,
but most of them could only turn to traditional economic activities--partic-
ularly agriculture--as a means of subsistence. The Government hopes to
prevent the recurrence of such a situation through the rehabilitation of NIOC.
8.04      In the present political and social context of Liberia, the conse-
quences of the closure of the NIOC mine will go beyond the social impact on
the area where the mine is located. The social disturbances which can be
expected from the closure of the mine are likely to affect the social climate
in the other iron ore mining operations in the country. In view of the most
precarious condition of these (in particular the Bong mine), the Government



- 47 -
considers that it is most important to avoid, to the extent possible, any
trouble which could jeopardize the operations of the other mines. Also,
the negative psychological impact of the closure of the NIOC mine on the
business community in Liberia would seriously impair the Government's effort
to stimulate private business and attract foreign investment, whether in
the iron ore or other sectors.
2.   Social Services
8.05      Furthermore, a number of social services provided by the mine
would either be lost or have to be taken over by the local government if the
mine were to close down. These include a 90-bed hospital, providing medical
services to approximately 80,000 out-patients and 4,500 in-patients on
an annual basis; 2 schools serving about 775 students; housing; and the
transportation/communication infrastructure which is presently maintained
by NIOC, constituting the only link for the western part of Liberia to its
capital, Monrovia.
3.   Tax Revenues and Other Macroeconomic Benefits
8.06      In 1979, based on NIOC's production of 2.4 million tons of a total
Liberian iron ore production of 19.6 million tons, NIOC's contribution to GDP
and export earnings can be estimated at 2.9% and 6.6%, respectively. This
would be lost if the mine were forced to close down.
8.07      Other macroeconomic benefits are the financial revenues which will
accrue to the Government (income taxes and dividends). Although the first
payments on these are not expected before 1988, these revenues will be sig-
nificant. Over the life of the project, these revenues are projected to
amount to approximately US$74 million. In addition there should be sufficient
cash to pay dividends of which 80% or US$30 million would go to the Government.
These payments would result in a 21% return on the US$7.1 million equity to be
provided by the Government for the financing of the project (para. 6.07). If
the probable reserves materialize and the mine life is extended to 1999, the
Government would receive additional tax revenues and dividends amounting to
more than US$148 million, leading to a return on equity of over 25%.
B. Long-Term Benefits
8.08      The long-term objective of undertaking this project is to enable the
Government to prepare--in an organized and timely fashion--for the eventual
closure of the mine. While the Government is aware that its iron ore reserves
are limited and that it must take steps to reduce its dependence on iron ore--
through diversification of its economic base--in order to ensure the future
economic stability of the country, at the same time, it recognizes that
iron ore earnings are an indispensable means to achieving diversification.
Development of NIOC's production potential of 3.25 million ltpy is an important
part of Liberia's effort to curb the erosion of its iron ore earnings.



- 48 -
8.09      To prepare for the eventual closing of the NIOC operations due
to depleted reserves, the project contains an economic development studies
component (para. 5.18). The objective of these studies would be to identify
potential alternative employment opportunities in the region and to outline
the steps to be taken to develop this potential to the extent possible by the
time the mine closes.
C.   Economic Rate of Return
8.10      The economic rate of return for the rehabilitation project is 26.5%.
Detailed calculations and assumptions are given in Annex 8.

IX. MAJOR RISKS
A.   Political/Socio-Economic Risks
9.01      The potential political instability of the country creates a risk
to the project. The Government is under considerable pressure from different
factions and the population at large to produce early socio-economic results
which are beyond its present means. The net result is an unstable situation
which could lead to further violent political change. One result of this
uncertain situation is the departure of a large number of the best trained
Liberians as well as expatriate technicians, which has created a managerial
void which will be very difficult to fill. Other results are the deteriorating
economic and financial situation of the country as well as the difficult
social climate resulting from the frustrated expectations of the population.
This could lead to shortages of critical supplies such as fuel and could
increase the risk of labor unrest (strikes or excessive wage demands). It



- 49 -
should however be pointed out that, because of the absence of any alternative
employment in the Mano River area, the unions have so far shown considerable
restraint in their negotiations with NIOC. Finally the political instability
and the existence of different political factions within the Government also
create a risk of political interference in the Company's operations.
9.02      These risks cannot be totally averted.  However, in the context
of the NIOC project, considerable effort has been made to reduce them. The
appointment of a professional management team with clearly spelled out respon-
sibilities and sufficient independence (para. 5.10) will fill the managerial
void resulting from the departure of trained Liberian as well as expatriate
technicians and managers. It will also reduce the risk of political inter-
ference in the operation of the Company as the Government has agreed to grant
the management team extensive responsibilities and authority which are spelled
out in the contract which it has approved. The setting up of a trust account
will also limit the risk of interference in the Company-s operations by pre-
empting any misuse of NIOC funds by a third party. Also the supportive attitude
demonstrated by the Government vis-a-vis this project is expected to temper
some of the risks mentioned above.  The Government has already proven that it
is willing to make considerable efforts to save NIOC by having provided some
US$8.3 million to keep the Company afloat and by the additional equity contri-
bution to project financing which the Government has agreed to make, notwith-
standing the difficult financial situation from which it suffers. As the
Government is the main beneficiary of the rehabilitation project, and since
project failure would place a heavy burden on the Government--guarantor of all
the project loans--there is a particularly strong incentive for the Government
to continue supporting NIOC as it has in the past and to avoid taking any
actions which could jeopardize the success of the project.
B.   Financial Risks
9.03      The project also faces a critical financial risk.  Indeed, the
financial rate of return is very sensitive to a fall in revenues. In such a
case, the Company might not be able to meet its tax obligations and/or repay
the entirety of its debt service obligations. Arrangements have, however,
been made so that the burden of this risk will lie exclusively on the existing
lenders and the Government. Indeed all tax obligations as well as debt
service payments to the existing lenders will be fully subordinated to the
new lenders and will be payable only once all operational requirements (i.e.,
current operational needs as well as renewal investments) are satisfied. As
a result of this subordination, the projected debt service coverage ratio
on senior debt is expected to be at all times above 1.5 (except for 1987).
In addition, in order to ensure that the revenues of the Company would be used
in priority to repay the senior debt, a security mechanism is being set up
with a trust account through which all sales proceeds will be channelled and
to which all long-term sale contracts will be assigned. Finally, the Govern-
ment will provide a guarantee for all new loans and will be asked to commit
itself to cover any cash shortfall which otherwise might jeopardize the
Company's future operations. With these various safeguards the senior lenders
are protected. This is at the cost, however, of the Government bearing a



- 50 -
significant financial risk as it might not be receiving any tax or dividend
payment before 1988 at the earliest and as it might be forced to put in
additional equity to cover possible cash shortfalls. The Government is
fully aware of these risks but considers that, in view of the high social
cost of a mine closure, this financial risk is justified.
C.   Managerial Risks
9.04      There are also managerial risks in this project.  Indeed, the
success of the rehabilitation project depends heavily on the management, whose
task is not only to implement the project successfully but also to correct
past faulty practices and avoid past mistakes which led to the critical
situation in which NIOC presently finds itself. As already discussed, NIOC
clearly does not have the managerial capacity to achieve this at present
(para. 3.09). The managerial assistance to be proposed (paras. 5.14-5.16)
is therefore one of the key components of the project. This assistance
would include both a temporary project implementation management team and the
setting up of a new management structure to manage the day-to-day operations
of the Company. With the Bank's assistance in formulating the scope of this
assistance and with its active involvement in project supervision and appro-
priate managerial covenants, it is believed that the management risks can be
sufficiently reduced.
D.   Technical Risks
9.05      The main technical risks relate to the infrastructure.  With regard
to the risk of a collapse of the bridge, it should be pointed out that since
Stanley Consultants Ltd. (January-February 1979) and Raymond (August 1979)
inspected the bridge, no one has investigated the impact of additional scouring
and corrosion. 1/ In their stability estimates, Raymond used rather conserva-
tive assumptions and the conclusion was that the piers were stable under the
assumed conditions of loading and scouring, and no indications of longitudinal
pier movement were found. However, due to the time that has elapsed, it can be
assumed that further scouring and corrosion has taken place; rough calculations
nevertheless indicate that the risk of collapse should have not increased by
more than 10% since mid-1979. Considering the safety margin used in Raymond's
stability calculations, it is believed that the risk of a bridge collapse at
this time is still reasonable. Beyond this risk, there is also the risk of a
major derailment on the railroad. However, such a derailment would have to
take place at a very critical location (approach of a bridge) to cause opera-
tions of the Company to stop for a period of time sufficient to jeopardize
its viability.  Therefore, this risk is considered remote.
9.06      Another technical risk relates to the operations of the plant.  As
in the past, when NIOC was unable to achieve the planned levels of production,
there is the risk that, notwithstanding the rehabilitation, such a situation
1/   Raymond proposed emergency repair on Pier No. 8 which was completed by
NIOC in November 1979. At that time, also, the train speed over the
bridge was reduced in order to create minimum vibrations.



- 51 -
could reoccur. This could result from an inadequate mix of ore, inappro-
priate plant flow sheet modifications, or insufficient power for additional
pumping requirements. However, sufficient studies and testing have been done
to ensure that the technical options chosen for the plant are appropriate.
Furthermore, the assumptions used in the projections of output grade as well
as cost are conservative and do not take into account the full expected impact
of the plant modification. Therefore, the risk that the plant will operate
below the assumed performance level is considered limited.
E.   Market Risks
9.07      Finally, the market risk is also present.  However, in view of
the particular characteristics of NIOC s iron ore and its specific target
market, the risk of NIOC not being able to sell its full production is
remote, as indicated by the commitments already received from NIOC's buyers.
X. AGREEMENTS
10.01     The following major agreements and assurances have been reached:
(a) From NIOC:
(i) that experienced management will be retained at the mine with
adequate qualifications and with adequate responsibilities
(para. 3.09);
(ii) that Caemi or an able marketing agent satisfactory to the Bank
will be retained (para. 4.14);
(iii) that it will not sell to local steelworks at a price below
the FOB price, based on the CIF Rotterdam price obtainable
for ore of similar characteristics (para. 4.16);
(iv) that it will prepare for submission to the Bank by March
31, 1982, a drilling program to be implemented as soon as
equipment is available but no later than December 31, 1982
(para. 5.07);

LIBERIA
NIOC IRON ORE REHABILITATION PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
1.        The financial projections which are given in Annexes 7-2 through
7-6 are based on expected production levels and estimated future operating
costs prepared by the consultants in the feasibility report. These estimates
have been adjusted to reflect certain expected real price increases as well
as the effect of future inflation. The inflation rate assumptions are 12.5%
pa in 1980, 9.0% in 1981, 8.5% in 1982, 7.5% pa from 1983-85 and 6.0% pa
thereafter.
2.        The following projected financial statements have been prepared:
(i) operating cost schedule, (ii) projected changes in working capital,
(iii) projected income statement, (iv) projected cash flow statement, and
(v) projected balance sheet. These are discussed in turn below.
A.   Operating Cost Schedule (in constant 1980 US$)
3.        Production.  The projected production levels of Mano fines, blast
feed and siliceous fines are discussed in para. 7.02 of the text.
4.        Sales Volume.  Projected sales volumes are based on available
production with an allowance in the years 1981 to 1983 for changes in
inventory.
5.        Unit Iron Ore Prices.  Prices for Mano fines are based on the
analysis given in paras. 4.16 and 4.17 of the text.
6.        Production Costs.  Production cost estimates for 1983 onwards have
been prepared by the consultants and reviewed by the Bank and are based on 1979
production cost/ton figures, expressed in mid-1980 US$, modified to take into
account the effect of the rehabilitation program. Costs for 1981 are based on
NIOC's latest financial statements and cost reporlts, and for 1982 are based on
NIOC's budget estimates. Production costs before and after rehabilitation are
given in constant 1980 US$ in the table below:
Production Cost Breakdown
(US$/ton--1980 constant terms)

ANNEX 7-1

As mentioned in para. 7.02 of the text, real-price adjustments for fuel mainly
and other costs have been taken into account resulting in real price increases
of about 13% by 1984 and a cost per ton after rehabilitation of US$7.09 (in
1980 US$ terms).
7.        General Overhead is based on 1979 costs and is expected to rise
slightly as a result of increased production and to remain constant in real
terms once the 3.25 million ltpy production level is achieved.
8.        Selling expenses are based on Caemi's fee/ton as well as the cost
of the analysis performed on NIOC's ore amounting to 3.5% of sales.
9.        The toll fee is equivalent to the interest and principal repayments
on the debt contracted by the Government to finance the rehabilitation of the
St. Paul River Bridge.
10.       Management strengthening in 1982 and the first half of 1983 repre-
sents the cost of the Met Chem contract based on the contractual ceiling for
the services as, agreed upon in the Met Chem contract. The mid-1983 to 1984
cost is comprised of the cost of the first post-rehabilitation operating year
for Met Chem services, as estimated by Met Chem, and an allowance for royalties
on expected production levels included in the Met Chem contract (see Project
File). After 1984, an allowance for two Met Chem staff (at the same rates in
constant terms as in 1981) is assumed. The cost of Met Chem in 1982, 1983
and the first half of 1984 (US$500 thousand) is included in the capital
cost estimate for the project and would be financed under the proposed loan.
B.   Projected Changes in Working Capital (in current US$)
11.       This schedule shows the yearly changes in the working capital
items based on the following principles:
Working Capital Formulae
Item                     Formula
Cash Balance             15 days' production costs
Accounts Receivable      30 days' sales
Accounts Payable         20 days' production costs
Inventories are accounted for on a LIFO (last-in, first-out) system.  During
the project period, inventories are built up as production levels increase.
Finished good inventories are held at 30 days of sales throughout the entire
projection.
12.       The short-term debt entry represents the amounts of short-term
debt which were repaid by the Government on behalf of NIOC.

C.   Projected Income Statement (in current US$)
13.       The income statement is based on the operating cost schedule
detailed above, escalated to current terms. Additional line items are
discussed below.
14.       Depreciation.  NIOC's past depreciation practices, which tied
depreciation to tonnages mined (see Annexes 3-1 and 3-2), have been revised
from 1981 onwards to reflect the useful life of the equipment as shown in
the table below:
Revised Depreciation Schedule
(US$ thousand)
Equipment Item                            Life (years)
Existing Assets
- trucks/dozers/loaders                        5
- rail cars                                    5
- electric shovels                            10
New Assets                                      12
Renewals                                         7
15.       Other Income.  For 1981, this represents the proceeds of the settle-
ment of a lawsuit. In 1982, this represents the writing off of outstanding
existing debt (US$4.0 million) and force account work done by NIOC for the
project, which cost is included in the capital cost of the project. In
1983, other income represents force account work done by NIOC.
16.       Interest on Trust Account.  This represents interest earned on funds
held in the trust account. It has been assumed that these funds will earn:
16% in 1982, 14% in 1983 and 12% thereafter.
17.       Financial Charges.  Financial charges on project loans are based
on the following terms.
Financing Terms
(US$ million)
Source                   Amount   Terms
World Bank--NIOC           11.7    12.6% for 13 years, including 5 years' grace
--Government    8.2    11.6% for 13 years, including 5 years' grace
African Devt. Bank         11.4     8.5% for 13 years, including 5 years' grace
Dutch FMO                   3.5     9.0% for 13 years, including 4 years' grace
OPEC                        8.3    12.6% for 13 years, including 5 years' grace

18.       Financial charges on the commercial bank loans are assessed at
interest rates of 4.5% above LIBOR: 21% in 1982, 19% in 1983, and 17% in
1984-85.
19.       Financial charges on existing loans show no interest in 1981
(as negotiated under the restructuring of NIOC's debt) and interest
beginning in 1982 according to the following terms:
Existing Debt
(US$ million)
Source               Amount   Terms
US Ex-Im Bank         2.93    12% for 13 years, including 6.5 years' grace
Christie Estate,
Cabila SA, and
LMC                 2.78    12% for 13 years, including 6.5 years' grace
20.       Income taxes.  Income taxes amounting to 50% of net profit before
tax will accrue until 1987 and appear as an interest-free loan from the
Government, equivalent to the amount accrued, from 1985-88. In 1988, NIOC
will begin paying income taxes on an annual basis and in 1989 will begin
repaying the accrued taxes.
D.   Projected Cash Flow Statement (in current US$)
21.       Cash Generation.  This flows from the income statement.
22.       Increase in Equity.  In 1981, this represents conversion to equity
of US$4.8 million owed to the Government (which included the repayment of
US$1.7 million of short-term debt by the Government for NIOC in 1980),
US$566,000 of existing bank loans which the Government repaid in 1980 which
is also converted to equity in 1981, and US$3 million additional equity
contribution to the project on all loans except the World Bank loan. Equity
contributions in 1982 and 1983 cover interest during construction.
23.       Long-Term Loans, IBRD/IDA and Others.  This shows the disbursement
schedule for the Bank, ADB, FMO, and other project loans which amount to
US$35.4 million.
24.       Government Loan.  The Government loan in 1980 amounted to US$4.8
million to cover operating cash shortfalls and US$566,000 used to repay
existing banks loans. As noted above, these are converted to equity in 1981.
In 1985-87, this represents taxes which are accrued but not paid. This loan
is repaid as shown in 1989-92.
25.       Commercial Bank Loan.  This represents the cash shortfall financing.
26.       Increase in Other Current Liabilities:  Flows from the changes in
working capital statement.



-61-
ANNEX 7-1
Page 5 of 6
27.       Increase in Rail and Ballast Inventories:  These have been shown
separately from the changes in current liabilities since they relate directly
to capital expenditures in the cash flow. The amounts for 1982 (US$1.2 mil-
lion) and 1983 (US$0.4 million), together with the force account work recorded
in the income statement under other income, amounts to NIOC's total participa-
tion equivalent to US$2.3 million.
28.       New Investment.  These include the rescheduled PPF in 1982 and
purchase of capital goods in 1982-83 amounting to US$22.7 million. This
amount plus US$5,440,000 for the management contract shown in the income
statement is equal to the total installed cost (and NIOC project preparation
cost), excluding the St. Paul River bridge as shown in the capital cost
estimate table.
29.       Renewals.  This is the schedule of renewal investments as determined
by the consultants in their final report. Some of the investments, which in
the consultants report were shown as renewals in 1983 and 1984, have been
included in new investments.
30.       IDC.  Interest during construction on the project loans in 1982,
1983 and the first half of 1984 is capitalized.
31.       Increase in Current Assets.  This flows from the working capital
schedule.
32.       Repayment of Long-Term Debt.  Long-term debt repayments on project
loans are according to the schedule in paras. 6.09-6.12 of the text.
33.       Repayment of Government Loan.  In 1981, this corresponds to the
US$5.3 million owed by NIOC to the Government and converted into equity.
In 1989 to 1992, it corresponds to the repayment of accrued taxes.
34.       Repayment of Commercial Bank Loan.  The schedule of repayment of
commercial loans anticipates that the commercial banks will be fully repaid by
1988. It is based on the projected cash generation capabilities of NIOC as
well as on the trust account reserve requirements.
35.       Existing Debt and Loans.  In 1980, US$566,000 has been repaid by
the Government. In 1981, US$630,000 of existing debt is repaid to Ex-Im Bank
from the proceeds of the settlement of a law suit which are partly assigned
to Ex-Im Bank. In 1982, US$220,000 is repaid in cash to the existing lenders,
and US$4.0 million is written off according to the terms of the restructuring
arrangements for NIOC's existing debt. The balance of US$5,710,000 is repaid
over 1988-94.
36.       Cash in Trust Account.  This corresponds to the end-of-year balance
in the trust account which is equal to one half of the following year's debt
service payments on senior debt (interest and principal) plus one twelfth of
the following year's total operating cost (i.e., total direct production cost
plus selling and administrative expenses).

39.       Dividend Payments.  No dividend payments have been assumed in the
forecasts. In any case, under the proposed financial covenants (para. 7.10(a))
NIOC would not be allowed to pay any dividends before 1992.
E.   Balance Sheet (in current US$)
40.       All balance sheet items flow from previous statements.

NIOC IRON ORE REHABILITATION PROJECT
FINANCIAL RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTIONS AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Assumptions
The financial rate of return calculation is based on the certainty
that, without the rehabilitation project, NIOC mining operations would cease
and the Company would be liquidated. It has been assumed that in the "with-
out the project" case, the net value of the Company--after repaying payables
and to some extent existing debt--would be zero. Therefore, in the "with
the project" case, all costs incurred, both investment and repayment of
existing debt, are considered to be incremental costs. Likewise, all benefits
accruing from the project are considered incremental benefits. These cost
and benefit streams are attached and are detailed below:
Cost Streams
(a) Capital Costs: This includes the investment cost for both
NIOC and the bridge, excluding interest during construction on the loans
to finance these;
(b) Operating Costs: This includes all production and selling
and administrative costs, but excludes depreciation which is a non-cash
item;
(c) Renewals: This stream is based on Met Chem's estimate of
replacement and renewal costs during the life of the mine. After 1993,
no renewal costs are included; however, if additional reserves are proven
and the mine life is extended, additional renewal investments will have
to be incurred;
(d) Working Capital: This stream reflects the large amount of
additional working capital which is needed to increase production from 2.4
million tpy to 3.25 million tpy. It is especially weighted in 1982 due to
repayments to suppliers for items purchased on credit; and
(e) Existing Debt: This reflects the remaining amount of existing
debt which must be paid by NIOC following the global arrangements made in
March 1981 to reduce and reschedule NIOC's existing liabilities.
Benefit Stream
Sales Revenues: This is the gross amount of sales revenues from
the sale of NIOC ore.

Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis:
The financial rate of return for the NIOC Rehabilitation Project
is 14.3%. Sensitivity to changes in capital costs, operating costs, sales
revenues (i.e., iron ore price or production level) and the delay in project
implementation have been analyzed. The case where additional reserves are
proven has also been considered. In this case cost and benefit streams are
carried out from their value in 1994 until 1999, with the exception of renewal
investments, which extend only to 1997. The financial rates of return for
both of these cases, as well as sensitivity analysis, are presented in the
table below:

NIOC IRON ORE REHABILITATION PROJECT
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTIONS AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Assumptions:
The economic rate of return calculation is based on the same
assumptions given in Annex 7-7 for the financial rate of return, with
the following modifications:
(a) Operating costs have been reduced to reflect the cost of
shadow pricing local labor. The shadow price rate in areas of Liberia with
scarce employment opportunities is 50%. At the local labor component of
operating costs amounting to about 20% of total cost, when shadow pricing
is considered, operating costs drop by 10%, as shown in the operating cost
stream.
(b) Social Benefits:
Social Services. The cost of social services provided by
NIOC--schools, hospital, road maintenance, public assistance/welfare and
housing--has been included as an economic benefit stream, based on the
assumption that these services would be lost if NIOC closed down and that
the benefit of these services is at least equal to their cost. To be
conservative, only 50% of all social benefits, have been included.
Employee/Indirect Taxes: Under the same logic as for social
services, 50% of employee salary taxes and indirect taxes have been added as
an economic benefit stream. These are shown in the social benefit column of
the attached cost/benefit streams. A detailed breakdown of these costs is
given on page 4 of this Annex.
(c) Other costs represents the portion of the cash generation
which, under present assumptions, could be distributed to foreign shareholders
or dividends. The total benefits accruing to Liberia were reduced by the
amounts.
Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis:
The economic rate of return for the NIOC project is high, at
26.5%, assuming production until 1994. Under the scenario that the mine
produces through 1999, this rises to 27.1% as shown in the table below
which also illustrates the economic rate of return's sensitivity to

changes in capital costs, operating costs, social benefits and sales revenues.
The economic rate of return is most sensitive to changes in sales revenues.
