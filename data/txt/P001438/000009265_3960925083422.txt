(LOAus 2080 anl 2081-M)
PREFACE
The IBRD Loans 2080-LBR (US$11.7 million) and 2081-LBR (US$8.3
million) provided financing for the rehabilitation of mine, railroad, and
port facilities to increase production of iron ore from about 1 million tpy
to 3.4 million tpy. The project was implemented by National Iron Ore
Company (NIOC), a Liberian Corporation.
Faced with a permanent shrinking of the market for its specialty
ores and as a result the prospect of continuous operational cash losses,
NIOC ceased operations on April 3, 1985. The company is in the process of
settling severance and pension obligations towards its employees.
The Government, NIOC's majority shareholder, has assumed the debt
service obligations for the rehabilitation loans.
Comments received from the OPEC Fund, one of the co-financiers,
have been incorporated in the final report and are reproduced as
Attachment TI. No comments were received from the Borrower.
This project has snot been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
LIBERIA - NIOC REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOANS 2080 and 2081-LBR)
HIGHLIGHTS
NIOC was established in 1958 by private Liberian and US investors
to develop the Mano River iron ore deposits near Sierra Leone. The
Government of Liberia received 50% of the shares in exchange for permanent
exemption from profit taxes and royalties (para. 2).
The NIOC Rehabilitation Project, which was initiated in 1978 at
the Government's request, was designed to increase both run-of-mine and
beneficiated ore output, reduce operating cost, and improve infrastructure
facilities, as well as the overall operations of the Company so that NIOC
could recover from a virtually bankrupt situation and continue operating
(paras. 4 and 5).
The project was appraised in December 1980 and approved by the
Board in January 1982. The Bank assisted NIOC in all aspects of project
preparation, including technical aspects, securing of financing,
restructuring of the company and management arrangements. However, between
1978 and 1982, NIOC's operations, which had been unprofitable since 1974,
continued to deteriorate substantially. In 1980, the Company defaulted on
payment of about US$6.5 million of long-term debt and incurred total losses
of over US$6.0 million which was covered by commercial bank credits until
August 1980, at which time Government assumed these liabilities, It was
thus clear that the survival of NIOC depended on the availability of (i)
the long-term financial package for the rehabilitation project and (ii) the
immediate shorter-term working capital funds to finance its cash losses
(para. 6).
The Bank played a key role in securing the financing package.
The working capital requirements of US$15 million was financed by
commercial banks. However, due to the highly risky situation of NIOC and
complexity of trust and insurance arrangements it took about one year to
secure this financing (para. 7).
For several months at the beginning of project implementation in
mid-1982, NIOC had sufficient operating funds. Working capital
disbursements of US$15 million under the rehabilitation package bridged the
ongoing cash operating losses. Thereafter the losses remained unfinanced
or were financed with considerable delays through various government
arrangements. Operations became erratic as procurement of spares and other
materials, fuel and lubricants became increasingly difficult. Numerous
late payrolls depressed staff morale. In addition, NIOC was struck by a
serious landslide accident which took 48 lives and injured 38 people
(paras. 14, 15 and 19).
In parallel to operations and after an initial delay of four
months, the rehabilitation project proceeded well until mid-1983.
Thereafter the pace of implementation slowed as the project became more and
more affected by NIOC's and Liberia's financial difficulties (para. 11).



In the second half of 1982, steel demand experienced a severe
downturn, as did consequently iron ore. NIOC (as all iron ore producers)
had to accept major price reductions in 1983, i.e. 9% in current terms.
Another reduction of 6% followed in 1984, and prices in 1985 remained more
or less unchanged (1986 prices for comparison are down another 1.1% on
average). Combined with higher than expected asset renewal requirements
after completion of the rehabilitation program, these price reductions
largely erased any prospects for short- and medium-term viability (paras.
16 and 21).
Long-term viability ultimately vanished in mid-1984, when NIOC's
market prospects were reduced from 3.25 million tpy to 1-1.5 million tpy,
far below break-even requirement. Technological change in blast furnace
mix, initiated in part by NIOC's unreliable deliveries both in quantity and
quality, and an agile competitor brought about the reduction of NIOC's
prospective sales volume (paras. 22-24).
In late 1984, the Government proposed to close the mine as it
could not support any longer the financial outlays required to keep it
open. A closure plan was prepared, dealing in particular with four months
of payroll arrears, phased termination, of em.ployment, and severance and
pension payments. NIOC closed on April 3, 1985 (pAras. 25-26).
Major lessons learned iinclude: (i) when preparing rehabilitation
projects and making an initial aseessment of the projects' financial and
economic viability, provisions should be made for possible further
deterioration during the period between preparation and start of
implementation. (ii) A corollary to lesson one is that rehabilitation of a
neglected capital stock is not only costly but costs are difficult to
estimate. Therefore, when making provisions for asset renewals of a
deteriorated capital stock careful assumptions (i.e., physical
contingencies) should be applied. (iii) To ensure that signals of
impending change in the market place are picked up, the basis for commodity
projections needs to be thoroughly reviewed one more time, whenever there
is a lapse of over six months between appraisal and board presentation.
(iv) Overstaffing, if existing, needs to be dealt with from the beginning,
even if the rehabilitated production volume warrants existing staffing
levels. During the rehabilitation period, the cost of keeping/releasing/
temporarily laying off the redundant staff has to be clearly identified and
financed as a separate project cost item.   Preparation of such programs
has to start early in the project cycle because they are politically
sensitive and require time to be agreed upon and to be implemented (paras.
30-34).



PROJECT CORMLETION REPORT
LIBERIA - NIOC REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOANS 2080 and 2081-LBR)
Introduction
1.        In February 1982, two IBRD loans totalling US$20 million 1/
equivalent were extended to the NIOC and the Government of Liberia for a
rehabilitation program to modernize the mining and railway facilities and
to increase the productive capacity of the operations. In addition to
World Bank financing, the rehabilitation program was supported by North
American commercial banks, headed by Bank of America, African Development
Bank (ADB), OPEC Fund, and Nederlandse Financierings-Maatschappij voor
Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. (Dutch FMO),
Background
2.        NIOC was established in 1958 by private Liberian and US investors
to develop the Mano River iron ore deposits near the Sierra Leone border.
The Government of Liberia received 50% of the shares in exchange for
permanent exemption from profit taxes and royalties. The Mann mine was
originally developed as an adjunct to the Liberia Mining Company (LMC) mine
at Bomi Hills, with whose ore NIOC's could be mixed to meet grade
specifications.
3.        NIOC had experienced losses in every year since 1974 except in
1977 when it benefitted from a peak in its selling prices while managing to
keep its costs at a stable level. In 1979 there was a dramatic
deterioration when (i) the production costs increased by more than 14%,
(1i) production remained static, (iii) the year-end loss was about US$1.7
million, and (iv) the Company defaulted on payment of about US$6.5 million
of long-term debt.
Project Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
4.        The NIOC Rehabilitation Project was initiated in 1978 at the
Government's request to rehabilitate NIOC in order to forestall imminent
closure of the Mano River mine. An identification mission visited NIOC in
the fall of 1979 and subsequently the Bank helped NIOC and the Government
to prepare the project by providing, in October 1979, a US$500,000 project
preparation facility (PPF) advance to the Government to finance consulting
studies and detailed engineering work to define the project scope, design
and viability. A Canadian consultant group undertook the preparation work,
and in July 1980 submitted the final report. A second PPF advance of
US$500,000 was approved In February 1981 to finance detailed engineering
and legal assistance.
1/ Loan 2080-LBR was to NIOC for US$11.7 million equivalent and Loan
2081-LBR was to the Government in thae amount of US$8.3 million
equivalent.



-2-
5.        The NIOC Rehabilitation Project was designed to increase both
run-of-mine and beneficiated ore output, reduce operating costs, and
improve infrastructure facilities so that NIOC could recover from a
virtually bankrupt situation and continue operating. The project was based
on proven ore reserves for at least 12 years' operation at the increased
level of production (after completion of the rehabilitation), and
additional probable reserves with the possibility of extending the life of
the mine for an additional 5 years. The concentrating plant output was to
increase from 2.3 million tpy to 3.25 million tpy with a recovery of 53%,
implying an increase in run-of-mine ore output from about 4.5 million tpy
to 6.1 million tpy. Due to scarcity of managerial and technical
capabilities in Liberia at that time, the project also Included management
and technical/engineering assistance to improve as well as to manage .he
operations of the Company.
6.        Between early 1978 and December 1980, the time of project
appraisal, NIOC's situation had substantially deteriorated as a result of
the shortage of funds, and senior staff departures. Due to equipment
breakdown and lack of spare parts, the mine was operating at less than half
of its capacity (below 100,000 tons/month) in 1980. Total 1980 losses
amounted to more than US$6 million and were covered by commercial bank
credits until August 1980, at which time these liabilities were assumed by
the Government. It was thus clear that without an immediate and
substantial inflow of funds within a short period of time NIOC would close
down. Therefore, the survival of NIOC depended on the ability to finalize
quickly the long-term financial package for the rehabilitation project and
on the immediate availability of shorter-term working capital funds to
finance its cash losses.

December 1986 are presented below:

The commercial bank financing was earmarked to cover the working capital
requirements (US$15 million) which could not be financed by long-term
lenders. To secure the commercial bank financing took about one year, and
its commitment had been made contingent on the setting up of a security
arrangement and on obtaining an insurance policy.
8.        Under the security arrangement, all sales proceeds were paid in a
trust account from which retentions were made automatically by a trustee
for the benefit of the lenders' debt service payments. All lenders were
party to this arrangement and benefited from the same protection. The
security trust agreement provided also for cross default clauses, as well
as various other covenants as to how NIOC funds would have to be used. A
US insurance company agreed to provide an insurance policy which covered
90% of the commercial bank loan against all risks (including political and
commercial risks) and on that basis, a syndicate was put together.
9.        The closing of the various loan agreements (except for ADB and
OPEC Fund), of the security agreements and of several dozens of other
contractual arrangements relating to the financial restructuring of NIOC
took place in New York on February 26 and 27, 1982. The loans became
effective by mid-March of 1982.
Project Implementation and Management
10.       At the end of 1980 NIOC had a severe shortage of qualified
management personnel. Over 20% of NIOC expatriates plus some of the senior
Liberian personnel had left the company during that year as a result of the
then perceived deterioration in NIOC's further prospects and the unsettled
political climate. In order to strengthen NIOC's management a management/
technical services agreement was concluded with a qualified consulting
firm2/ to provide the key personnel required to implement the project, as
well as to manage the overall operations of the mine, until these key
managerial functions could be filled with suitable permanent staff.
11.       After the consulting firm began its work in March 1982, NIOC's
Board appointed an Executive Officer as liaison with the expatriate
management team. This'unanticipated move required a new delineation of
management responsibilities which resulted in an initial implementation
delay of about four months. Subsequently, the mine rehabilitation and
repair of the St. Paul river bridge proceeded well on the revised schedule
until about mid-1983. Thereafter the pace of implementation slowed as the
project became increasingly affected by NIOC's and Liberia's financial
constraints, although never to the extent of seriously jeopardizing
physical project construction objectives.
12.       One of the financial constraints caused at the country level was
Liberia's difficulty to service its debt, which led to repeated
disbursement suspensions by both IBRD and the ADB. In the latter's case,
very slow procurement processing contributed to further delays. Another
constraint caused at the country level was the suspension of OPEC Fund
2/ This firm had already prepared the preliminary mine plan and basic
engineering for mining and concentrating equipment and railroad
rehabilitation, including estimates of capital and operating costs.



-4-
disbursements in 1984. 3/ The funding shortfall was eventually compensated
by the twi.. IBRD and the ADB loans which were not fully committed due to
capital cost underruns.
13.       NIOC's own financial constraints slowed the pace of
implementation because management had to focus more and more on financing
bi-weekly payrolls and procuring vital operating supplies on a day-to-day
basis. The consulting firm performed very well under the circumstances.
NIOC Operating Performance
14.       While the rehabilitation project was being implemented NIOC
continued its mining operations. During a brief period from about April to
December 1982, the company's working capital situation was satifactory.
Disbursement of the commercial loan funds of US$15 million (para. 7)
permitted on-time payment of wages and salaries as well as the settlement
of payables arrears and thus procurement of sufficient operating supplies.
After 1982 NIOC's internal and external operating parameters deteriorated
step by step. Initially the company's short-term prospects worsened;
later, its long-term viability became doubtful and eventually vanished.
The key factors leading to the closure decision were (i) iron ore prices
far below projections; (ii) continuous operating losses; (iii) replacement
investments much higher than projected; and (iv) permanently shrinking
markets.
15.       Landslide Disaster.  At about 3.30 a.m. October 6, 1982 dumped
overburden material and original ground material slipped about 250 m into
the old tailings pond No. 3, causing tailings saturated with water after
three days of torrential rains to flow over the No. 3 retaining dam and
into the outskirts of No-way and Jeng-Jeng villages. Two company-owned
houses, comprising 12 family dwellings, and five private houses were
completely demolished and buried. The death toll was 48, and an additional
38 persons were injured. All company-owned units in No-way camp were
subsequently abandoned permanently and inhabitants relocated on safer
grounds. Attachment 1 provides details on the disaster causes and
subsequent actions.
16.       Iron Ore Prices.  After agreeing to a 15% price increase in early
1982, the steel industry was surprised by a major drop-off in demand after
mid-1982. Iron ore was quickly in oversupply and has been since. The
resulting downward pressure on prices, reinforced by a strong US Dollar,
produced consecutive price reductions in 1983 and 1984 and unchanged prices
for 1985. The table below shows the disastrous difference between actual
and Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) iron ore prices for Mano Fines, NIOC's
main product:

The projections were based on several assumptions. The first one was that
production costs for iron ore would not change in real terms because large
iron ore projects then under consideration could not expect to produce at
significantly lower cost than existing ones and therefore they would not
generate any dcwnward price pressures. This assumption was correct,
however major production cost differentials were generated after 1982 by
the differing exchange rate policies of producer countries against the US
Dollar. Producers whose currencies depreciated in real terms against the
US Dollar were not only able to absorb the iron ore price reductions, some
of them, e.g. Brazil, even prospered. Liberian producers on the other hand
could not profit from such currency realignments because the US Dollar is
Liberia's currency.
17.       The second assumption was that iron ore prices would increase in
real terms by 1% p.a. based on a 4% p.a. real term increase in fuel costs
which represented about 25% of the production costs for iron ore. It was
also assumed that iron ore prices would increase with inflation. At the
time the forecast was made, these assumptions were not unreasonable and not
out of line with expectations elsewhere in the industry. In early 1982
producers were awarded a 15% price increase over 1981, a strong positive
signal by the steel mills. Had they foreseen the collapse of steel demand
and production after mid-1982 there would have been no price increase.
18.       Operating Deficits.  Initially in 1982 and 1983 these were in the
order of US$0.5-0.75 million per month. Later, as iron ore price cuts
deepened, and cash shortages led to production losses, they increased to
about US$1-1.5 million per month. Required to provide operating funds as
needed to NIOC during the rehabilitation period, the Government waived
payroll taxes and interest differentials, assumed fuel payables, arranged
for short-term credit from local banks and made small cash contributions to
NIOC. However, NIOC's funding needs were at all times considerably larger
than the Government's financial capabilities.
19.       Attempting to maintain production, NIOC gradually depleted the
small stocks it had, and made full use of whatever credit local suppliers
were willing to extend. Once these sources were exhausted, operating
supplies could be procured only through cash transactions with the
exception of fuel deliveries from the state-owned refinery. However,
several times during 1983 there were country-wide fuel shortages, during
which NIOC had to curtail operations; in one such instance in early 1983,
production had to stop for about one month. Since the available cash fell
far short of requirements, supplies were bought in a costly, piecemeal
fashion, such as lubricants by the drum and tires on a one-by-one basis.
Numerous payrolls were missed by one or several days and often could be
secured only at the last minute so that the controllers' staff had to work
frequently through the night to get ready for scheduled cash wage payments
the next morning. At times payments were made exclusively in coins
(dollars and quarters) reflecting the severe liquidity shortage of the
country. November 1984 through March 1985 wages and salaries were only
paid end-March 1985.

20.       The continuous shortage of crucial operating supplies resulted in
production volume and quality shortfalls, which led to revenue losses,
which in turn led to more shortages of operating supplies, a vicious
cycle. The table below, which gives financial indicators for 1979-1984,
shows NIOC's deterioration.

21.       Replacement Investments (Renewals).  Starting in early 1983,
various long-term scenarios for NIOC were defined and evaluated to
determine whether the company could eventually achieve viability after
completion of the rehabilitation. In the process routine asset renewal
expenditures were estimated for the post-rehabilitation period. The
results indicated total renewals of US$35.5 million through 1992, 20% above
the SAR estimate for the same period. This increase reflected both the
ongoing neglect of renewals, as well as an upward revision of general
renewal requirements.
22.       Markets.  Lack of sufficient future demand for NIOC's specialty
ore was the final blow to the company, occurring in July/August 1984.
Prior to that, NIOC's European marketing agent had repeatedly stated that
placement of NIOC's rehabilitated production of 3.25 million tons would
pose no problem. Bank missions visited several of NIOC's customers during
1983, who confirmed their continued interest to take the contracted
tonnages of NIOC ore, but complained about timeliness of delivery, low
available volumes and unsatisfactory quality.
23.       Since the mid-1970s, when NIOC's operations started to
deteriorate the company had not been able to fully meet its delivery
schedules.4/ Customers began to purchase from competitors, mainly an
4/ The original 'Kano I" iron ore beneficiation plant, commissioned in
1962, was ill-conceived from the beginning. Therefore, a new flow
sheet was developed and US$30 million were invested over the 1972-74
period to create the "Mano II" plant with a production capacity of 4.5
million long tpy of sinter fines. However, the "Mano II' plant
encountered severe operational problems from start-up in 1975 and NIOC
was never able to meet projected annual output or grade
specifications. This was largely the result of poor technical
decisions made by the managing firm and of poor supervision of the
engineering firm in charge of plant modification, which resulted in a
lawsuit settled at the benefit of NIOC.

Australian mine, which soon captured a majority share of the market. When
the rehabilitation project was approved, NIOC's customers agreed to take
the tonnages arrears under existing contracts, i.e. 13.6 million tons, and
indicated their intent to negotiate new contracts at 3.25 mtpy thereafter.
The rehabilitation schedule given to the steel mills indicated that
production would increase to 1.95 million tons in 1982, 2.95 million in
1983 and 3.25 million tons in 1984, whereas actual production during these
years was only about 1 mtpy in 1982-83 and 0.8 million tons in 1984. Even
these small tonnages were not always shipped on time. In addition,
customers were annoyed by iron ore not in line with technical
specifications (moisture content too high, Fe content too low). Partly
because of this, NIOC's customers began to review the load composition of
their blast furnaces, experimenting under Japanese technical cooperation
with a different feed mix, not requiring NIOC type ore.
24.       The combination of technological change, customer
dissatisfaction, including the eventual lack of belief that NIOC would ever
be able to resume reliable delivery at the 3.25 mtpy level, and an agile
Australian competitor reduced NIOC's prospective sales volume in 1985 to
1-1.5 mtpy, with a distinct possibility for further shrinking in future
years. This tonnage was far below NIOC's breakeven point which was at
about 3.25 mtpy in the SAR but later increased to about 4 mtpy due to
subsequent price reductions.
Mine Closure
25.       Numerous scenarios were evaluated on the basis of financial
projections before agreement was reached that NIOC should close down.
These included cost-cutting measures, temporary mothballing until recovery
of iron ore prices, and different production levels. In mid-1983 there vas
still reasonable evidence that NIOC would, after completion of the
rehabilitation, be able to recover its cash operating cost and contribute
to debt service. On a sunk cost basis and provided that NIOC's debt could
be rescheduled or supplementary bridge financing could be m;ade available,
NIUC was still generating financial and economic benefits. Later in 1983,
NIiL.  was reappraisea to determine whether there was a case tor
supplementary tinancing. The results, mainly due to steeply increased
renewal costs (para. ;1), indicatea that iaLW was unviable in the
snort-term and possibiy in the long-term too.  The 19b4 iron ore price
reductions and tne market collapse during the same year (paras. ib, 22, 24)
erasea any remaining viability ot NlOUC both short- and long-term.  The
prospects wnich Niiu faced iu beptember 1984 (and would still race today)
are summarized in tne income statement ana  cash tlow projections overleai.
They assumed that IlVt, coula sell up to Z.1 mtpy, including about J.5 mtpy
of spot sales at a discounted price. The projections indicated that (i)
Niluf would incur losses turougnout the projection period 1984-20(A); and
(ii) from 19b5-199b tnte amounts required for asset renewals would be larger
than the funds generated trom operations, i.e. there would be continuous
cash operating losses.

26.       Under these circumstances and in the absence of prospects for
further funding from the lenders, the Government reluctantly proposed after
several colenders' meetings to close NIOC on April 1, 1985 (actually April
3, 1985). This happened in early January 1985, at which time the company
had not paid wages and salaries since October. To help bring about an
orderly closure without labor unrest, the Bank, Dutch FMO, and ADB agreed
to disburse the outstanding balances of their loans against payroll
expenditures for November 1984 up to and including March 1985,
supplementing insufficient Government funds.
27.       As NIOC ceased operations, the flow of revenues into the trust
account stopped. The amount available for the debt service payment of June
14, 1985 was insufficient and Government has since assumed NIOC's
obligations. Subsequently, the commercial banks consortium, which had an
insurance policy on 90% of its loan of US$15 million invoked this
insurance. The bank consortium will be paid after 12 months from the date
of claim, i.e. around August 1986, and the insurance company will be
subrogated to the rights on 90% of the commercial bank loan.
28.       After closure, NIOC's workers filed a lawsuit regarding
severance pay and pension rights, which the Government did not contest and
on which the court ruled favorably later in 1985, awarding about US$3.6
million for severance pay and continuing pension obligations in the order
of US$50,000 per month. The Government has issued promissory notes for the
severance obligations. They are redeemable before July 31, 1987 either
from funds to be received from paid in capital by any investor who would
acquire interest in NIOC and/or from the sale of NIOC's assets.
29.       Recently, a group associated with the former co-owners of NIOC
and one of NIOC's subordinated lenders under the trust agreement, has
contacted the Government to discuss reopening the mine free of any debt
service obligations at a volume of 500-750,000 tpy. The Government
reportedly have asked the potential investor to pay US$5 million as
up-front capital, to which the latter did not agree. Up to now, the
lenders, who would have to waive any rights they might have to the proceeds
of NIOC's iron ore sales, have not been officially contacted. At this time
the scheme's practicability and viability are highly uncertain.
Lessons for Similar Projects
30.       A first lesson is that the viability of a rehabilitation project
declines continually during preparation and implementation, because of the
ongoing and continuing deterioration of the capital stock and operations in
general. This trend is only reversed after the rehabilitation has been
completed and the productive efficiency of an operation has been
re-established. In NIOC's case, the time span between identification and
beginning of implementation was about 4.5 years, during which the company
continued to incur losses and could not properly maintain its capital
stock. As a result, the cost of rehabilitation increased, both to cover
additional deterioration, as well as new losses. How long a project can
tolerate this erosion before it becomes unviable depends on the degree and



-11-
speed of deterioration (in addition to the usual external factors such as
product prices and factor costs). Therefore, when preparing rehabilitation
projects and making an initial assessment of the project's financial and
economic viability, a specific deterioration factor covering the
preparation and implementation period should be estimated and applied.
31.       A second corollary lesson is that rehabilitation of a neglected
capital stock is not only costly but costs are difficult to estimate
fully. As project implementation progressed, projections for future asset
renewals after rehabilitation were revised upward several times, because
assets were even more deteriorated and thus more costly to renew than
originally expected. The SAR had projected renewals of US$29.49 million
for the first nine years after project completion. The last pre-closure
projections indicated US$41 million for the same period. This implies that
high physical contingencies must be applied when estimating the cost of
renewing a deteriorated capital stock.
32.       A third lesson is that the basis for commodity projections needs
to be thoroughly reviewed one more time if say more than six months elapses
between appraisal and board presentation. Commodity discontinuities of a
major nature do not happen overnight, even though they may be recognized as
such rather suddenly. Such signals of impending change will be picked up
at the time of the main market work during project preparation and
appraisal. Therefore, whenever there is a long delay between appraisal and
board presentation, there is a risk that the latest market developments may
not enter into the judgment, particularly if the published commodity
material has not changed since the original market work and a routine
update thus seems adequate.
33.       A fourth lesson is that over-staffing, if existing, needs to be
dealt with from the beginning, even if the rehabilitated production volume
warrants existing staffing levels. During the rehabilitation period, which
is likely to require much less staff due to depressed production, the cost
of keeping/releasing/temporarily laying off the redundant staff has to be
clearly identified and financed as a separate project cost item.
Preparation of such programs has to start early in the project cycle,
because they are politically sensitive and require time to be agreed upon
and to be implemented. In NIOC's case, no particular provisions were
taken, since it was assumed that the rehabilitation program would be
completed quickly. As the program was delayed by NIOC's deteriorating
operational situation and iron ore prices dropped, cost-cutting measures
became urgent, but results were slow and insufficient, because virtually
all realistic savings opportunities were related to payroll expenditures.
This is not to imply that large, early staff reductions would have saved
NIOC; the company's problems were eventually too severe all around.
34.       A fifth lesson is that project risk analysis has to be more
elaborate, specific, and quantitative. In NIOC's case, the scenario on
which the project's viability rested represented a positive maximum next to
which downturn probabilities dominated. However, even the maximum scenario



-12-
barely kept NIOC in a balanced cash position. Additional explicit
scenarios, exploring the probabilities and quantitative implications of a
negative evolution of selected project parameters, would have emphasized in
particular, that the company's cash flow could be balanced or positive only
if no downward risk at all were to materialize. On the other hand, the
high riskiness of the project was well known and was taken into account
when presented to the Board. The specific trust and insurance arrangements
for the project which are extraordinary by Bank standards attest to this.
Thus, it is not likely that risk analysis per se would have changed the
basic decision; it would, however, have contributed to the decision making
process by acknowledging the risks in a formal, highly visible fashion.

LIBlP.TA;- NIOC Rehabilitation Project - Back-to-Office Report
1.      In accordance vith terms of reference dated Ssptember 30, 1982, a
supervision utsson visited Liberia October 17 - 23.  A full Supervision
Report ts belng prepared. The nurpose of this brief beca-to-office report
Is to Inform Bank management cofinanciers and concerned staff about a
recent major landslide disaster in the NIOC concessioo.
2.      On October 6, 1982, at 3:30 am. a 8mave landslide occurred on
U-lill (see attached uap). The landslide, consistint partly of fW"Tre$
overburden material and partly of orlpinal troundc? rsterial ulipnpe about
250 meters Into the old tallines pond No. 3, causiug old tailins!s,
saturated with water after three days of torrential rains, to flow over
the No. 3 retaining dam and Into the outskirts of No-way and Jeng-djng
villAges.   Tvo company ovned houses. eomprising 12 faully dwellg, and
5 prlvate houses were completely demolishe,4 and buried.  When the rescue
efforts were suspended after five days, 47 bodies had been recovered
together with 39 Injured persons. one injured died two days leter
bringing the total death toll to 48. In view og the agrnitude of th.e
disaster the 'Read of State declared tJo-wsy and Jenp-Jent dlsaster areas
and a two day perlod of natioral mourning (October 7-P) was proclalned.
Production in the mine was storree for one wee1;.
3.      In the rescue work NIOC personnel were assisted by about 150o
soldiers and local authorities.  Further assistance and medical sipplies
were offered from other Liberiar. conpanies (Song and tAM1) and throu.h
eribassies of a number of countries. Cash contributions to the surviving
victtta of the dlsaster were given b7 1.1beriar conpanies and foreier.
countries and a co-mittec has been estatlis'e' to supervise th.e funds.
4.      Sone i=nediate actions to prever.± further dnaager were taken:
(t)  The reaainin£ 31 famlies  r. icoparv owned houses in
flo-way were temporarily relocatee to other villages and
eacps outside the disaster area below tailings dam ?o. 1;
(1i)  All other duupsiteu were Investigated in an effort to
determine the risks for slides. The dumps were fount! to
pose so threat to human habitation;
(Wii) Cul"erts have been put In to draln water from the weatern
part of tailings pond No. 3 which was cut of by the
landslide masses from Its decantiag tower; and
(iv) The No. 3 dam was thoroughly inspected and found to be
Intact.

s.      The Mnlistry of Lands, MInDs and Energy (MLf) detached an A-san
technical team oan October 11, 1982 to Investigate the causes and effects
of the landslide. A report of the findings was submitted to the mission
on October 22 and Is available in the IND Information center files. wiUC
is also preparing a report Including a survey of the slide are and thls
report vill be submitted to the ?ani In beginning of November.
6.      According to the HLET report the landslide was caused by several
factors, the most Important ones being:
(1) P.emoval of primary forest on the slopes for farmlng
purposes thus Increasing surface erosion; and
(1i)   Development of transverse cracks through the waste dump and
the underlying weathered material In combination with
abundant rain fell causing water swepare Into the dutwp end
the original $round;
7.      The MLX! report does not clearly state what seems to be the likely
event: a massive (more than one million ton of caterial) rotational
movement of the original slope which was only partly covered by the waste
dump (see attached sketch). It should be noted that this is the first
collapse of a natural slope in the area *snce NTOC started minLng
operations ore than twenty years 8go.
8.      The disastrous result of the landslide and the loss of hunan lives
was further caused by:
(i)   Abundant rainfall over a period of tine which saturated the
old tailings In pond No. 3 and caused the material to
becone like highly viscous sud; and
(ii)   the location of the No-vay houses only about 15' meters
frori the dam.
It Js unlikely that the actual slide masses would have reached No-way If
the ta±lln3s in pond ro. 3 had been fully settled Instead of beinr like
mud. N.'o loss of human lives would have occurred If the houses In No-way
had been located further away from the dan. In respect to the latter the
report criticises previous management for poor planning of the location of
the r-Hill dumpsite, the tailings pond and No-way and Jeng-Jeng camp
sites. The Inability of management to prevent farming on the slopes
within the concession area Is also criticised.

9.      The following recommendation* ore quoted from the MmLE reports
(1) That all the Company owned units tn No-way Camp be sbans.
doned permanently and that these units be demolished
lmediately and Inhabitants should be relocated on ofer
grounds;
(1i) That the drainaRe outlet beading from the very viscous
clayey section of the taillngs pond be kept opened at all
times, as this ensures or prevents the spillage of sedi-
ments and water outo flo-way Camp and Jeag-Jeng Town;
(11i) That deforestation due to forming and firewood collection
be discouraged, especially along the slopes of areas
having waste dumps, as this nethod of forest destruction
leaves the soil barren, exposing the cliffs to Intensive
*oil erosion during periods of torrential rains;
(iv) That mana7ement informs Its workforce through informal
lectures, as to the causes, effects, and post disaster
measures of the landslide. In the interest of
psycholotical security, managenent should conduct gtided
tours to all dumpsites and eiplain the possibility or
impossibility of landslides;
(v)  Thet no leter than recerher 192, th.e canagement of WItC
should corpletely rerove the verv viscous clayey sedicents
frot the taillngs pond so that the falure tone on H11-f1
(75 feet wide, 200 feet long anO about 300 feet high) can
be blasted and spread Into the tailings povd thereby
reducing the possibility of another disaEter;
(vi) That the slome stability of mine benches be maintained to
avoid water seepage which could create extensive cracks
ar.d eventual mass wastInt;
(vii)  That a teilings pond be corstructed to collect and settle
the solids fror the excessive waste waters dralning froun
mine duaps and hill slopes and the washing plant, which at
present tends to flow directly into nearby streams,, creeks
snd the already polluted Mano River;
10.     The disaster will not Interrupt production at Mtano River or delay
the rehabilitation program. The cost Implications are being evaluated.
Recoumendation (v) above can be quite costly and difficult to achieve
vithin given tiue fraae. Recommendation (vii) above is to a =Jor extent
part of the rehabilItation program since the unsatlfactory environmental
conditions were Identified during appraisal.  A   w tailings pond does
already exIst but Is not yet In use.

11.     The possibility of a serious dliaster of thie rather complicated
nature could not be foreseen. Rovever, during appraisal the close
location to the dam of the No-4ay houses was noted and the dag, including

COMMTS RECEIVED FROM THE OPEC FUN FOR INTERNATIONAL DENELOPMENT

1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington D.C. 20433
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Maiss,
Subject: Project Comletion _ port on
Liberia-NIOC Rehabilitation Project
Thanks for sending us a copy of the above report in draft
for our perusal prior to its finalization for presentation to
the Bank's Executive Directors. As far as the OPEC Fund's role
is concerned, the presentation is generally fair but in one re-
spect, it is our view that perhaps a reconsideration thereof
should be made and this concerns paragraph 12 on page 3 of the
report.
While it is correct to state that disbursements from the
OPEC Fund Loan No. 270P were suspended during the course of the
project, the notification thereof was conveyed inter alia to the
PCR.     Government of Liberia (GOL) and the Bank by telex of February 1,
Para 12 1984 but disbursements from that Loan actually proceeded up to
modified the end of May, 1984 rather than 1983 as specified in the draft.
It should be noted also that the substantial part of the loan
proceeds had in any case been disbursed by the closing date,
specifically US$ 6,385,685.67 out of the total loan of US$ 8,300,000.
Another point that should be underlined is that the sus-
pension of the loan was brought about by GOL's failure or in-
ability to service two Fund loans extended thereto previous to
Loan No. 270P. If I may so observe, the suspensions of the loans
of the other term lenders mentioned in that paragraph were equally
"for reasons unrelated to the project" as they were motivated by
the same considerations as the Fund's. Moreover, at the time
all these suspensions occurred, it was apparent to all cofinanciers
that the project was no longer viable.  Furthermore, the additional
commitments entered into by both Banks which were dirrcted towards
"orderly closure" could be conceived as being also project-un-
related.

In view of the foregoing, we would thus appreciate modifi-
cations 'to the penultimate sentence in paragraph 12, specifically
as to the timing of disbursement suspension and deletion of the
word "permanent" and also the last six words therein. Meanwhile,
we look forward to receiving a copy of the final report as promised,
please.
