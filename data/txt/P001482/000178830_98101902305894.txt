INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR FOR THE
ANDEKALEKA HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Democratic Republic of Madagascar for the equivalent of US$33.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance the Andekaleka Hydroelectric
Project. The proceeds of the credit would be onlent to the Malagasy Elec-
tricity and Water Corporation (JIRAMA) for a period of 25 years including 5
years of grace, at an interest rate of 7.5 percent per annum. The project
would be co-financed on a joint basis with loans from the Abu Dhabi Fund
(US$5.0 million), the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (US$10.0
million), the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (US$10.0 million), and
the Saudi Fund for Development (US$12.0 million); and on a parallel basis with
loans from the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (US$16.5 million),
and the Canadian International Development Agency (US$15.4 million), on
various terms and conditions.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Madagascar:  Economic Memorandum on Current
Economic Position and Prospects and Selected Development Issues" (Report No.
1099a-MAG) was distributed to the Executive Directors on December 20, 1976.
An updated summary of the conclusions is set out below. Country data sheets
are provided in Annex I. A Bank mission, scheduled for June 1978, will review
recent economic developments and prospects.
3.        With a GNP per capita estimated at US$200 in 1977, Madagascar is
one of the poorest countries in the world. It is predominantly an agricul-
tural country and 85 percent of its 9.2 million people live in rural areas
with a per capita income of about US$120 per annum.  In many areas the
standard of living is close to subsistence level. Although the country
is sparsely populated (an average of 16 inhabitants per square kilometer),
there is great pressure on cultivable land in some regions. Owing mainly to
different ecological conditions, the highlands are more advanced than the
coastal areas, and the south is particularly poor with a harsh, arid climate
and infertile soils. The east coast is rich agriculturally, but crops are
frequently devastated by cyclones. Internal migration is common and has
accelerated as improved roads have provided access to new areas. However,
poor roads remain a major constraint to development; only one third of the
main highways are passable in all weather in a country where production
centers may be as far as 800 kilometers from main points of consumption. Many
areas are cut off from the rest of the country for several months each year.



-2-
4.        The basic political program of the Government has been outlined in
the Charter of the Socialist Revolution published in September 1975. Major
institution and policy changes aim at:
(i) Decentralization: greater local responsibility for development
is to be encouraged by giving the provincial administrations
and fokonolona considerably increased authority.
(ii) Land reform: the few large estates left unexploited are to be
broken up and sharecroppers would receive the land they
actually work.
(iii) Rural development: high priority is to be given to increasing
incomes and services in the poorest areas.
(iv) Basic education: all children of school age are to be gradually
enrolled in a new five-year primary education program with a
curriculum which is to be made more relevant to local circum-
stances.
(v) Greater national participation in commerce and industry: the
commercial banks, insurance companies and a number of other
key businesses in foreign hands have been nationalized and
Government may become a majority shareholder in all major
enterprises.
5.        Over the five years ending 1975 annual growth of GDP, averaging
less than one percent, lagged far behind the 3 percent annual increase in
population; and GDP per capita (in constant prices) fell by 11 percent.
The drop in real income per capita was even steeper, about 17 percent,
owing to the sharp fall in the purchasing power of exports resulting from
worsening terms of trade. With falling real income, gross domestic savings
declined from 14.5 percent of GDP in 1970 to only about 11 percent in 1975.
But for the restraint on the growth of government consumption, achieved
mainly through curtailment of expenditure on materials and maintenance, the
rate of savings would have recorded an even sharper decline. Actual budgetary
outlays on investment remained practically unchanged during 1970-75 and, as
private investment spending, particularly foreign investment, was inhibited by
policy uncertainties, the rate of investment declined more or less in step
with the rate of savings. Consequently, the overall resource gap remained
small. Estimates prepared by IMF indicate some resurgence of growth during
the last two years largely as a result of increasing agricultural production.
Real GDP consequently has been rising at about the same pace as population.
6.        Agricultural production increased during 1970-75 at an average
annual rate of just under 2 percent, or somewhat faster than the rest of
the economy. The overall growth of the agricultural sector, however, con-
ceals divergent commodity output trends. Cash crop output went up com-
paratively fast, owing mainly to the rapid growth of cotton and coffee
production. Production of coffee, which has become by far the largest



single export earner, increased by 31 percent over the period to nearly
90,000 tons, while seed cotton output nearly doubled. But production of
paddy, the principal staple, rose only marginally to 1.8 million tons neces-
sitating increasing reliance on imports of rice, while output of groundnuts,
the main source of edible oils, and sugarcane was virtually stagnant and meat
production actually declined. Since 1975 crop production levels - barring
coffee, affected by adverse weather conditions, and groundnuts - are reported
to have registered a further rise. Several factors such as poor marketing
arrangements, transportation problems, farmers' lack of access to extension,
credit and improved inputs, and insufficient price incentives explain the
inadequate growth of farm output and the consequent erosion of availability
of food products for exports as well as the increasing dependence on rice
and edible oil imports.
7.        Encouraged by generous fiscal incentives and protection against
competition from imports extended to investors, industrial capacity and
output had been expanding, although from a rather narrow base, fairly
rapidly until about 1970. Thereafter, however, the growth of manufacturing
output, consisting mainly of textiles, processed foods and agriculture-based
products destined for the home market, slowed down considerably. Although
production of cotton textiles has, except in 1973, continued to expand
comparatively fast, the annual growth of industrial output has averaged only
about 2 percent. A number of unfavorable developments appear to have affected
the pace of industrial growth and development in recent years. Domestic
market has not been expanding much. Price controls, statutory wage increases
and the rising cost of imported inputs have generally lowered manufacturing
profits. Investment has been discouraged by the uncertain policy environment.
8.        Fiscal pressures strengthened from 1970 onwards as a result of weak
growth of budget revenues, rising expenditure on personnel and the subsidiza-
tion of rice imports undertaken as a counter-inflationary measure. The Govern-
ment, however, was able, through overall restraint on spending, to avoid until
1975 a serious deterioration of the budgetary situation. With economies
effected in current expenditure, particularly in the purchase of materials
and supplies, budgetary savings during 1970-75 averaged about FMG 8 billion
per year and financed close to 60 percent of capital outlays. Actual spending
for capital development, however, increased but marginally, partly because
of small rise in allocations and partly as a result of constraints encountered
in implementing the investment budget. With larger capital expenditures
and rising current outlays for social services as well as the extension of
subsidy to locally procured rice, the budgetary situation worsened after 1975.
Despite an exceptional 25 percent increase in revenues during the year,
budgetary savings dropped sharply in 1976, and no budgetary savings are likely
to have been generated in 1977. The Treasury deficit continued to widen to
reach an estimated FMG 17.8 billion in 1977. Reflecting the Government's
emphasis on a bolder development strategy, the budget for 1978 envisages a
near doubling of allocations for capital expenditure and projects a further
substantial increase in the Treasury deficit. In view of the implementation
constraints, however, investment spending as well as the deficit may eventu-
ally turn out to be smaller than the budget forecasts.



- 4 -
9.        Outstanding bank credit and money supply were increasing at a
comparatively moderate pace until 1973. Monetary and credit expansion in
subsequent years, however, has been fairly rapid and reflects Government's
budgetary needs and its increasing recourse to Central Bank financing. The
Government, which until 1973 had remained a net lender to the banking system
turned thereafter into a net borrower. Inspite of slow growth of real output
of goods and services, prices, judging by the consumer price index, seem to
have remained reasonably stable except for the 22 percent increase occurring
in 1974. However, because of extensive price controls and the emergence
of secondary markets in periods of scarcity, the index tends to be a poor
indicator of price movements; and the actual rate of inflation has very
probably been higher.
10.       The balance of payments position deteriorated considerably after
1974 despite increasing restrictions on foreign trade and payments.
Madagascar was a member of the French franc zone until 1973 with virtually no
trade and exchange controls. Restrictions were introduced when it left the
franc zone with the intention of limiting non-essential imports, and have
since become stricter and more comprehensive. The merchandise and current
account deficits widened sharply in 1974; and, as net public capital inflow
and foreign investment declined, foreign assets of the banking system fell by
US$7.4 million. A larger payments deficit, leading to a further decline in
net foreign assets of US$14.0 million, occurred in 1975. The payments
deficits reflected largely the serious worsening of the terms of trade after
1973; but increasing imports of rice and edible oils, which peaked in 1974, as
also the static, or declining, volume of most agricultural exports other than
coffee, contributed to the underlying weakness of the balance of payments. The
balance of payments is estimated to have registered a surplus of US$7.3 million
in 1976. This surplus is attributable essentially to a 20 percent decline in
the import bill owing to delays in authorizations under the restrictive 1976
import program. Export earnings during the year fell due to the drop, from the
unusually high level of 1975, in clove exports and smaller sales abroad of
manufactures. In spite of some improvement in export receipts estimated to
have occurred in 1977, the balance of payments is again expected to be in
deficit because of larger imports of rice, equipment, spare parts and other
essential commodities. At the end of November 1977 net foreign assets stood
at only US$53.4 million, or just about 17 percent of the annual import bill.
The IMF has approved a standby arrangement for SDR 9.4 million against the
first credit tranche for a period of one year, as well as a Trust Fund Loan of
about the same amount. The Government intends to check the drain on reserves
in the future through policy measures designed to restrain the growth of
consumption expenditure instead of through reliance on stricter import curbs.
11.       Medium- and long-run development prospects for the economy are
favorable. There is considerable scope for the expansion of agriculture and
livestock production. Only about a fifth of arable land is at present being
cultivated, while fertilizer consumption, estimated to be some 14,000 tons in
1976, is still rather small. The irrigation potential has as yet been only
partially exploited. The outlook for further development of manufacturing
based on locally available materials is promising. On the whole, sustained
growth at an average annual rate of 4-5 percent appears to be within the realm
of feasibility.



12.       A Three-Year Plan, which is to be the first of a series of medium-
term investment programs intended to attain specific long-run development
objectives by the end of the century, was launched this year. The Plan
envisages overall expansion of the economy at an average annual rate of
5.5 percent during 1978-80. The rate of investment is projected to rise
to 17.1 percent by 1980 from an estimated 11.5 percent in 1977. The savings
rate is to be stepped up, partly through the mobilization of additional
budgetary resources for capital development. But about a quarter of the
investment outlays during the Plan period will need to be financed through
external loans and grants. Greater emphasis will be placed on the development
of food crops; and household consumption is targeted to rise, in real terms,
by 3.6 percent per year. The Plan also accords high priority to manufacturing,
particularly basic industry and processing of agricultural raw materials.
13.       Official development assistance to Madagascar averaged about US$58
million per annum during 1970-75, somewhat over half of it being in the form
of grants. Over this period annual gross official flows from DAC countries
increased from US$32 million to US$42 million, France's share declining
slightly from 76 to 64 percent. Disbursements on long- and medium-term loans
more than doubled to US$20 million between 1970 and 1976. During the latter
year external loan aid commitments amounted to nearly US$42 million of which
US$36 million represented IDA credits. New major sources of external loans
are the European Development Fund and Peoples' Republic of China; in 1975
the latter committed US$54 million to be disbursed over the next ten years.
As a result of concessionary terms under which most external assistance
was granted and of the 1972 agreement canceling about 43 percent (US$27 mil-
lion) of the debt owed to France, Madagascar's current level of indebtedness
is low. External public debt disbursed and outstanding at the end of 1976
was US$181 million, of which the Bank's share was 14 percent and IDA's was
37 percent. Service payments on this debt amounted to US$13 million in
1976 (or about 5 percent of merchandise exports), of which payments to the
Bank Group represented 17 percent.
14.       In view of Madagascar's low per capita income, external assistance
should continue to be provided on concessionary terms, although the presently
low debt service ratio seems to indicate that modest amounts could be borrowed
on harder terms. In addition, in view of the scarcity of local capital
resources, external assistance should continue to cover a high proportion of
project costs, including in appropriate cases some portion of local currency
outlays.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MADAGASCAR
15.       Madagascar has received thirteen IDA credits amounting to US$125.2
million and five Bank loans totaling US$32.6 million. About 60 percent of
Bank Group lending has been for transport, 28 percent for agriculture and the
balance for education. IFC's first investment was made in March 1977 with
an equity investment of US$290,000 and a loan of US$11.0 million for the



- 6 -
expansion of a textile mill; other projects in leather and ferrochrome
are under active consideration. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank loans and IDA credits, and of IFC investments as of April 30, 1978,
as well as notes on the execution of ongoing projects. The priority given
to transport investment recognizes that improvement in communications is a
precondition for Madagascar's development. Four projects have been for the
construction of all-weather links between the island's different regions, one
for improvements to Madagascar's main port of Tamatave and one for the moderni-
zation of the railway line between Tamatave and the capital, Antananarivo.
Bank Group lending for agriculture consists of two livestock development
projects, two irrigation projects and a forestry project. A study on the
problem of agricultural marketing and meat pricing is being executed with
the assistance of an international consultancy firm.
16.       In the past, problems have arisen in the course of execution of
several projects. There were delays in execution, cost overruns and defi-
ciencies in institution building, especially in agriculture. The Morondava
Project continues to encounter problems, but implementation of the Village
Livestock Project has improved substantially. Likewise, the highway projects
are proceeding satisfactorily. Progress of all projects is being closely
monitored.
17.       In our future lending to Madagascar, we intend to continue focusing
primarily on infrastructure development (power, water, roads, and railway),
agriculture and education. A second railway project and an irrigation project
in the lower Mangoky area have been appraised. A water supply and sanitation
project is under active preparation, as are a third education project and a
fifth highway project. We are further assisting the Government in preparing
an agriculture credit project, which would include a component based on the
fokonolona system.
PART III - THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
The Energy Sector
18.       The main known energy resources of Madagascar are hydroelectric
potential, coal, lignite, and oil shale, all virtually untapped. The forests,
covering about 16 percent (100,000 km ) of the country, are on the other hand
widely exploited as a source of firewood. The evaluations carried out so
far have concluded that exploitation of fossil fuel deposits would be un-
economical, while the hydroelectric resources can be developed gradually, as
demand develops. Fuel accounts for approximately 10 percent of total imports
and consists essentially of crude oil which is processed at the Tamatave
refinery.
19.       Domestic consumption accounts for about 80 percent of energy use in
the country. In rural areas, firewood is virtually the only source of energy;
in urban areas, despite the availability of other energy, firewood still



-7-
accounts for at least one half of domestic usage, because it is the cheapest
energy source for cooking and heating purposes. The extensive consumption
of firewood has a considerable ecological impact, as the natural forests are
being rapidly depleted and erosion is increasing. Reforestation is, therefore,
urgently needed because a shift to other energy sources would be uneconomic
for the majority of the population.
20.       The industrial and transport sectors account for an annual consump-
tion of some 35,000 tons of mineral fuel products. In addition, the industrial
sector is the largest user of electricity. The Government is putting increased
emphasis on the development of the industrial sector in order to reduce unem-
ployment and boost exports. Increased provision of electric power is essen-
tial and, wherever possible, priority is given to the development of the
hydroelectric potential.
The Power Sub-Sector
21.       Until 1973, the institutional responsibility for the power sector
was divided between two companies with foreign interests, the Electricite et
Eau de Madagascar (EEM) and the Societe d' Energie de Madagascar (SEM).  These
companies were nationalized and a single, autonomous electricity and water
corporation (JIRAMA) was established, to carry out the national objectives of
the Government, described in a Presidential Ordinance of 1974 as follows:
(i) to provide gradually the whole country with electricity and
water supply facilities;
(ii) to provide these services at the lowest price;
(iii) to unify gradually policies in the fields of production,
transmission and distribution of electricity and water, as
well as tariffs; and
(iv) to maintain tariffs that would enable recovery of all costs
as well as generating a reasonable surplus to finance part of
the expansion.
The difficulties associated with the merging of the two entities into one
organizational framework, the selection of key personnel and the introduction
of procedures were resolved quickly and JIRAMA now functions as a single,
well-integrated entity. The legal framework of the sector is satisfactory.
22.       JIRAMA's electricity facilities consist essentially of a large
Interconnected System around the Antananarivo area, which accounts for one
half of its installed capacity of 100 MW and two thirds of its annual sales
of 230 GWh, and 30 isolated systems essentially located in the larger urban
centers. Independent generation facilities account for 58 MW of installed
capacity, mostly in bagasse-fueled power plants on sugar estates and in
remotely located, small-scale industries.

23.        Industrial consumption accounts for about two thirds of both JIRAMA's
Lotal sales and the Interconnected System's sales. The bulk of the industrial
sales are accounted for by a small number of textile plants. Commercial sales
are relatively small - less than 10 percent, while domestic consumption ac-
counts for 25 percent of the total. At present, about 58,000 households in
the Antananarivo area have electric connections and 31,000 in the rest of
the country. Approximately 70 percent use electricity for lighting purposes
only, which explains the low level of consumption: 610-650 kWh per household
per annum. Access to service is restricted; less than a quarter of the house-
holds in the supplied areas use electricity, while in the country as a whole
less than 5 percent have access to electricity. The major constraints are:
(i) the high costs of electrification of new areas; (ii) full payment of
connection costs by the consumer; and (iii) higher costs of electricity
when compared with firewood, for heating and cooking, and with candles, for
lighting. JIRAMA will reconsider its pricing policy after completion of
a market survey, which is now underway, to assess to what extent the full
payment of connection costs by consumers affects the demand for new con-
nections, particularly for lighting purposes.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.        A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report, Andekaleka Hydroelectric
Project-Madagascar" (No. 1795a-MAG) dated May 15, 1978 is being distributed
separately. A supplementary project data sheet is given in Annex III. The
project was prepared by the Government with assistance of consultants, and
appraised by an IDA mission in August 1977. Negotiations were held in
Washington, D.C., from March 16 to 22, 1978. The Malagasy delegation was
led by Mr. Leon Rajaobelina, Governor of the Central Bank, and included Mr.
Caleb Rakotoarivelo, JIRAMA's General Manager.
Description
25.        The Andekaleka Hydroelectric Project would meet the growth of demand
until 1992 in the Interconnected System, as well as provide substantial fuel
savings. It represents about 70 percent of the investment in the power sector
for the period 1978-82. The credit would also provide for the strengthening
of JIRAMA, particularly in planning and staff development. The feasibility
study, preliminary design and pre-engineering of the project were carried
out by Surveyer, Nenniger and Chenevert, Inc. (SNC) of Canada. The Canadian
consultant Societe d'Ingenierie Cartier Limitee has been contracted to prepare
tender documents and to supervise project implementation.
26.        The project comprises:  (i) the Andekaleka Hydroelectric Plant;
(ii) a preliminary study and cost estimate of the Ankorahotra storage reser-
voir; (iii) technical assistance and training. These can be described as
follows:



- 9 -
(i) The Andekaleka Hydroelectric Plant
(a)  a concrete diversion dam 10 m high and 125 m long,
and an intake structure;
(b)  a tunnel 5.2 m in diameter and 4 km long;
an underground powerhouse for four 28-MW units;
and tailrace and access tunnels;
(c) two turbines and two generators, each of 28 MW;
(d) electrical and mechanical equipment; and
(e) a 138-kV, 150-km transmission line to Antananarivo.
27.       The Andekaleka plant will be situated on the Vohitra river 115 km
east of Antananarivo. It will utilize a fall of 242 m in the Vohitra river
over a river distance of 10 km. The foundation rock for the diversion dam
and the intake is exposed and of good quality. The tunnel alignment has
been explored by 20 borings and the rock is also of good quality, except in
a few short faulted zones where concrete linings will be needed and where
the tunnel passes beneath a tributary stream bed with insufficient rock cover
and a steel lining will be required. The tunnel is designed for optimum use
of three 28-MW units; the fourth 28-MW unit will be utilized as standby and
for peaking.
28.       The Government is considering constructing a ferrochrome plant
near Moramanga, between Antananarivo and Andekaleka. If commissioned, this
plant would be a major electricity user and a third 28-MW unit would be
justified. Feasibility studies for the ferrochrome plant are now underway
and the Government is presently setting up a financing consortium. A final
decision will be taken during 1978. Bidding documents for the proposed
project would provide for an optional third turbine and generator, with the
option to be exercised before end-1978. The project and its financing plan,
however, are based on two units.
(ii) Preliminary investigation and design for a storage reservoir
29.       The design for the project, with provision for four generating units,
could only be finalized when the feasibility of constructing an upstream stor-
age reservoir was confirmed. The benefits of the fourth unit, to be added in
a later stage, can  only be fully reilized if an adequate upstream storage
reservoir of about 400-500 million m is constructed, for which a possible
site has been identified at Ankorahotra, 45 km from Andekaleka. Additional
geological investigations undertaken from October to December 1977 confirmed
that the dam, at an estimated cost of US$54 million, is technically feasible
and economically justified. Retroactive financing for up to US$200,000 from
September 1977 is recommended to meet the cost of these studies.

(iii) Technical assistance and training of JIRAMA staff
30.       Madagascar lacks sufficient planning capacity in the power sector;
there is also need to strengthen the accounts department of JIRAMA, and to
establish electricity tariffs based on long-term marginal costs. JIRAMA
has prepared a five-year training program to supplement the facilities and
practices already in use in order to serve all levels and categories of staff,
including water operation staff. The project will strengthen the planning
department of JIRAMA through the secondment of expatriates knowledgeable in
power planning who would train counterpart staff, and will include financing
for the five-year training program. Provision is also being made to form a
power planning unit in JIRAMA.
Project Cost
31.       The estimated total project cost is about US$116 million equiva-
lent, including a foreign exchange component of about US$100 million. The
project is exempt from customs duties and taxes. Detailed cost estimates
were prepared by SNC and Cartier, and are as follows:

32.       The high percentage of foreign costs (86 percent) is due to the fact
that the local contribution would consist only of manual labor. Cement and
lumber must be imported, together with all other supplies and equipment. In-
terest during construction is to be capitalized and financed by a loan from
the Government.



- 11 -
Financing Plan
33.       The financing of the proposed project would be shared among seven
international colenders and Madagascar as follows:
External Sources                                   US$ Million
Abu Dhabi Fund                                       5.0
BADEA                                               10.0
Caisse Centrale                                     16.5
CIDA                                                15.4
IDA                                                 33.0
Kuwait Fund                                         10.0
Saudi Development Fund                              12.0
Sub-total     101.9
Internal Sources
JIRAMA                                              14.1
Total          116.0
34.       All loans and credits would be made to the Government of Madagascar
for subsequent on-lending to JIRAMA. The proceeds of the proposed IDA credit
would be on-lent to JIRAMA under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement on terms and
conditions to be approved by the Association, for a period of 25 years in-
cluding 5 years of grace, at an interest rate of 7.5 percent per annum
(Section 3.01(b), draft Development Credit Agreement). The other colenders
have stipulated that the proceeds of their loans would be on-lent to JIRAMA
on the same terms as those granted to the Government. In May 1977, CIDA
made a loan of US$13.3 million equivalent towards the project, which became
effective on August 1, 1977. In the near future, CIDA will make an additional
loan of US$2.1 million equivalent for the same purpose. Both loans are for
a period of 50 years including 10 years of grace, interest free. The US$10
million BADEA loan was signed on April 30, 1978, but is not yet effective;
the loan is for a period of 25 years including 5 years of grace, at an annual
interest rate of 4 percent.
35.       The proposed loan of US$16.5 million equivalent from the Caisse
Centrale is for a period of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at an annual
interest rate of 6 percent. The US$12.0 million equivalent loan from the
Saudi Fund will be for a period of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at
an annual interest rate of 3 percent. The terms of the US$10.0 million
equivalent loan from the Kuwait Fund and of the US$5.0 million equivalent loan
from the Abu Dhabi Fund are not yet known; the latter has not yet formally
confirmed its participation. Fulfillment of the conditions of effectiveness of
the above mentioned loans is an additional condition of effectiveness of the
proposed IDA credit (Section 5.01 (b), draft Development Credit Agreement).
All colenders will cooperate closely during project implementation and a draft
memorandum of understanding to that effect has been agreed and will be signed
once all the loans have been approved.



- 12 -
Project Implementation
36.       JIRAMA would implement the proposed project with assistance from
Cartier Engineering. Assurances were obtained that JIRAMA will continue to
employ engineering and management consultants, and other specialists on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Association (Section 2.02, draft Project
Agreement). Cartier has taken full responsibility for the design prepared by
SNC. Project implementation should present relatively few problems. A
special feature is that all transport to the site will be done by railway (the
Antananarivo-Tamatave line follows the river at Andekaleka). The railroad has
provided suitable assurances to JIRAMA as to its cooperation for the proposed
transport. The power station is expected to be commissioned in mid-1982.
37.       JIRAMA has a reasonable degree of autonomy.  JIRAMA's General
Manager, a civil engineer with an impressive managerial background, has
responsibility for the day to day operations. At the technical level, all
senior posts and, where required, the posts below, are occupied by well-
qualified and experienced engineers. On the other hand, the Administrative
and Finance Department suffers from an acute shortage of qualified account-
ants. Efforts are now underway to strengthen the department (ref. paragraph
40). JIRAMA will give the Association an opportunity to comment on proposed
new appointments to the posts of Interconnected Zone Manager, Development
Manager, and Administrative and Financial Manager (Section 3.02, draft Project
Agreement), and JIRAMA will continue to conduct its operations under qualified
and experienced management and staff at all levels (Section 3.04, draft
Project Agreement).
38.       Consideration is being given to applying to JIRAMA the new "Charter
of Socialist Enterprises". Under this Charter, a Management Committee would
be constituted by the General Manager, and representatives of the State and
the staff, to which the General Manager would be accountable. The staff
would elect a Workers' Committee which would be consulted on all reforms
affecting the staff.
39.       JIRAMA employs a total staff of approximately 3,900 persons in-
cluding 2,600 assigned to the electricity operation. Indications are that,
since its inception, JIRAMA's permanent unskilled staff has grown much faster
than the extent of its operations would justify. JIRAMA has agreed that the
size of the permanent unskilled staff will not be increased beyond the level
required by the scope of its operations (Section 3.03(b), draft Project
Agreement).
40.       JIRAMA's main training center, located near Antananarivo, provides
for the training of lower cadres and new recruits in the technical and admin-
istrative aspects of district operations. JIRAMA organizes seminars which
range from literacy at the lowest echelons to highly specialized technical
subjects. JIRAMA also sends technical staff to seminars abroad and sponsors
fulltime students in foreign universities. JIRAMA has prepared a comprehen-
sive training proposal, covering all categories of staff, including the water
operation staff. The project includes a training component, based on JIRAMA's
proposal. Cartier has agreed to train the JIRAMA staff who will be in charge
of operating and maintaining the Andekaleka power station.

Financial Prospects
41.       Considerable difficulties have been experienced with regard to
the establishment of a uniform system of accounts and accounting policies
covering all of JIRAMA's operations. This task was completed by end-1977.
Efforts are now underway to recruit qualified accountants to head the Inter-
nal Audit and Budgetary Sections. Budgetary control systems are now being
introduced.
42.       It is difficult to analyze fully JIRAMA's present financial posi-
tion and prospects, as in the past the electricity and water operations were
not clearly separated. It was therefore decided to establish an opening
balance sheet as per January 1, 1977 in which all fixed assets were stated at
their replacement values, current assets and liabilities were actuals as of
that date, and long-term debt, including debt to the Government related to the
compensation of related foreign interests, was stated at its outstanding value.
Formats for the electricity and water income statements were established to
permit a reasonable analysis of the main accounts, and as a basis for the
financial projections.
43.       JIRAMA's opening balance sheet indicates a low indebtedness and
a high liquidity level. Accounts receivable, equivalent to 5.5 months of
sales, are high and are mainly accounted for by arrears due by the Government
and its Administration. The Government has presented specific satisfactory
proposals to reduce these arrears to a more reasonable level by the end of
1978.
44.       The tariff structure is complex, often bearing little relation
to costs. The tariffs in effect are still those of JIRAMA's predecessors,
complicated further by the fact that since the late 1960s the Government has
frozen certain tariffs in order to help low income groups. The Government is
aware of the need to establish a national tariff policy, and some attempts
have already been made by JIRAMA in this direction. It is now planned as a
first step to establish electricity tariffs in the Interconnected System based
on long-term marginal costs. JIRAMA, with external assistance, is presently
preparing such a tariff, based on terms of reference satisfactory to the
Association. Assurances have been obtained that tariffs based on principles
of long-term marginal costs will be introduced by July 1, 1979 (Section 4.05,
draft Project Agreement).
45.       Over the 1978-82 period, JIRAMA will be able to finance about
30 percent of the electricity construction program out of cash internally
generated in its electricity operation. JIRAMA's electricity tariff will be
reviewed periodically to enable it to continue to earn 8 percent on its net
revalued fixed assets for its electricity operations (Section 4.03(a), draft
Project Agreement). Assurances were obtained that: (i) JIRAMA will maintain
separate accounts for the two operations, electricity and water supply; and
(ii) during the Andekaleka construction period: (a) no funds will be
transferred from the electricity to the water operation, (Section 4.06, draft
Project Agreement) and (b) no dividends will be paid (Section 3.04, draft
Development Credit Agreement).



- 14 -
46.        While in the past the electricity operation has been profitable,
leaving a reasonable surplus to finance expansion, revenues of the water
operation have only been sufficient to cover operating costs, including
depreciation, but with little surplus for expansion. As a result, the
electricity operation helped finance the water construction program. The
return on the net revalued assets of the water operation is expected to
decline from nil in 1977 to -4 percent by 1982, causing a financing gap of
about US$20.0 million in the water construction program. The Government
is well aware of the problem, and undertook to provide or cause JIRAMA to
be provided with the necessary funds to finance deficits and construction
requirements of the water operation (Section 3.03, draft Development Credit
Agreement).
47.        During the 1977-82 period, JIRAMA's overall debt-equity ratio will
increase from 11/89 to 39/61, which is still satisfactory. In order to ensure
that adequate debt service coverage will be maintained, assurances have been
obtained that JIRAMA will consult with the Association prior to incurring
new long-term debt, should the projected ratio of debt service to consolidated
net revenue fall below 1.5 (Section 4.04, draft Project Agreement).
Procurement
48.        Agreement has been reached on the allocation of the different bid
packages among the co-financing agencies. The civil works are to be financed
on a joint basis by the four Arab funds and IDA. Civil works contractors have
already been prequalified, and procurement is being carried out in accordance
with IDA guidelines for international competitive bidding. IDA will also
finance turbines, valves, transformers, gates and linings, as well as tech-
nical assistance, drilling and pre-engineering.
49.        The contracts to be financed by CIDA and Caisse Centrale will be
awarded in compliance with their procurement regulations. CIDA, which is
already financing JIRAMA's contract with Cartier, will also finance the
transmission line. The Caisse Centrale will finance electrical equipment,
generators, and substations.
Disbursement
50.        Proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed against:  22 percent
of total expenditures for civil works; 100 percent of total expenditures for
turbines, gates and transformers (supply and erect contracts); 100 percent
of foreign expenditures for technical assistance and training. The balance
of the civil works would be financed by the four Arab agencies under a pro-
posed joint financing scheme. Madagascar would send withdrawal requests to
each colender, which after review and approval would disburse funds in the
following proportion: BADEA, 21 percent; Kuwait Fund, 21 percent; Saudi Fund,
25 percent; Abu Dhabi Fund, 11 percent, and IDA, 22 percent. The lending
agencies will coordinate closely on the progress of disbursements.



- 15 -
Ecology
51.       The diversion dam is too low to have an important effect on the
upstream channel because the area is not populated and the impoundment extends
only 700 meters upstream. With the first two units in operation the flow will
be minimal or nil for about 4 km downstream of the dam to the mouth of the
tributary, the Sahantsiva River, about 120 days per year. Little effect is
expected from this because the 25 m high Tarariana rapids prevent migration
of fish in this reach in any event, and the pools formed by the rapids are
expected to support the fish populations during the days of zero flow. The
change in water flows will not affect the water supplies of any villages.
The first stage of construction requires no further ecological study. Such a
study will be required when the future Ankorahotra storage dam is constructed,
as wildlife is present and the area is populated albeit sparsely.
Justification
52.       Several power market surveys have been made for the Interconnected
System in recent years. The long-term trend method was adopted for the proj-
ect analysis, forecasting a yearly growth rate of 7.6 percent as "probable",
while the "high" and "low" forecasts were derived by advancing, or deferring,
the probable forecast by two years (+ 15 percent). The "probable" forecast
indicates that the Interconnected System would face both energy and capacity
shortages around 1981-82 if generation facilities are not increased.
53.       Several hydro and thermal plant alternatives to meet the demand
growth of the Interconnected System under various scenarios were compared at
various discount rates. The least-cost solution under all reasonable scenarios
has been adopted for the project. The economic return represents a minimum
estimate as the full economic benefits of the project are not reflected by the
electricity revenues alone. The return on investment would be approximately
11 percent, or 15 percent should the ferrochrome plant be commissioned in 1982.
The lowest return obtained under sensitivity analysis is still a satisfactory
9.6 percent. The project will permit substantial savings in fuel imports.
Risks
54.       The risks of this project are those normally associated with hydro-
electric plants, namely (i) unforeseen bad geological conditions; (ii) over-
investment; and (iii) institutional and financial difficulties. In order to
reduce these risks geological investigations were carried out, which concluded
that the rock is generally good, and a preliminary feasibility study was
undertaken at Ankorahotra, showing that construction of a storage dam is
technically possible and economically justified. Although a first phase
consisting of three units instead of two appears slightly better in the case
of the probable forecast, the decision has been deferred until end-1978 in
order to reassess demand forecast at that time. JIRAMA has also agreed to
take a number of steps to improve institutional deficiencies, particularly in
the Accounts Section.



- 16 -
55.       The various risks have been minimized to the extent feasible, and
they are worth taking, considering the potential benefits. A new source of
power will be needed by 1982 and the adopted plant is the least-cost solution.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
56.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Democratic
Republic of Madagascar and the Association, the draft Project Agreement
between the Association and JIRAMA, and the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
57.       The draft Development Credit Agreement and the draft Project Agree-
ment conform to the usual pattern of agreements on power projects. Special
conditions of the project are listed in Section III of Annex III of this
Report. Execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government
and JIRAMA, as well as fulfillment of conditions of effectiveness of the
external loans providing the balance of external funds to be obtained by
Madagascar are additional conditions of effectiveness of the proposed credit
(Section 5.01(a) and (b), draft Development Credit Agreement).
58.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
59.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 200-MAG:      Tamatave Port Project; US$9.6 million credit of
June 19, 1970; Date of Effectiveness: November 27,
1970; Closing Date: July 1, 1977; US$1.8 million
supplementary credit of July 30, 1973; Date of
Effectiveness: December 15, 1973; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978.
The project originally consisted of port extension, purchase of
cargo handling equipment, construction of a tanker terminal, and provision
of consultancy services for engineering and supervision, and technical assis-
tance. A supplementary IDA credit was made in 1973. All civil works of the
project have been completed with the exception of the tanker terminal which
was considered no longer justified because of substantial increases in costs.
The Association has agreed to delete this item from the project and allow the
available balance of the credit to finance the provision of additional cargo
handling equipment and technical assistance. A recommendation to that effect
was circulated to the Executive Directors on October 8, 1976 (IDA/R76-78).
Organizationally, the Port Authority is improved, but is still far from
being well-managed. The financial situation is expected to improve when new
tariffs become effective in early 1978; however, the Port Authority is not yet
financially viable. The Closing Date has been extended by 8 months to allow
disbursements for remaining project costs.
Credit No. 322-MAG:      Morondava Irrigation and Rural Development Project;
US$15.3 million credit of June 30, 1972; Date of
Effectiveness: April 30, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Initially, the project was to rehabilitate and extend, in the
Morondava area, existing irrigation systems, and develop 9,300 ha (4,700 ha
for small-holder rice, 2,700 ha for a tobacco state farm and 1,900 ha for a
cotton state farm); village development, roads, schools and health facilities
were included. The project as revised and substantially reduced in late 1975
will complete major civil works envisaged at appraisal, implement on-farm
development works on 2,500 ha of rice areas, establish an applied research
station, and provide agricultural support services, roads and health
facilities.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 3
Major civil works (including construction of a diversion weir at
Dabara, rehabilitation of the Dabara Canal and the North Canal, construction
of secondary irrigation and drainage canals, and construction of the 8.1 km
road between Mahabo and Ankilivalo) are almost completed. The Laricultural
research station at Analaiva has also made encouraging progress. However,
on-farm development works have lagged behind schedule, due largely to poor
management of SODEMO, the project implementing authority. There has been some
recent improvement in force account development works, but both agricultural
extension and cotton production activities .^re still very weak. The project
will not be completed until 1980-81, rather than December 1978 as originally
planned. SODEMO has produced no audited accounts since its establishment in
1973, but it is clear from a recent study by consultants that it has sustained
serious losses and must continue to rely heavily on government grants for its
revenues. Consultants are being retained to assist in updating accounts, to
introduce management information systems, and to assist in preparing a new
financing plan. A recent mission reviewed a program of action to clarify
SODEMO's financial position and responsibilities, and improve its management.
This will be followed up carefully with the Government in the coming months.
Credit No. 351-MAG       Third Highway Project; US$15 million credit and US$15
Loan No. 876-MAG:        million loan of January 17, 1973; Date of Effectiveness:
April 17, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977; US$5.6
million supplementary credit of September 24, 1975; Date
of Effectiveness: February 15, 1976; Closing Date:
July 1, 1978.
The major components of the project are construction works on about
250 km of primary roads in the central part of the country and consulting
services for detailed engineering of a further 200 km of primary roads. Con-
siderable project cost increases have been experienced as a result of price
escalation and currency realignments, but physical progress and quality of
construction works under the project are generally satisfactory. To help the
Government in meeting part of the cost overruns, the Association approved in
September 1975 a supplemental credit of US$5.6 million. At that time, it was
agreed to delete one of the roads (RN1 between Arivonimamo and Analavory)
from the project and to include financing for its construction in the Fourth
Highway Project. The Closing Date has been extended by 6 months to allow
disbursements for remaining project costs.
Credit No. 488-MAG:      Railway Project:  US$6.0 million credit of June 27,
1974; Date of Effectiveness: September 26, 1974;
Closing Date: July 31, 1979.
The project comprises relaying of 60 km of track, extension of
yards and sidings, acquisition of freight wagons, passenger coaches and mis-
cellaneous equipment; and provision of technical assistance to the railway in
management, financial and operational areas, and to Government for transport
planning and coordination studies. Because of cost overruns the Association
is financing only 5 out of the 20 passenger coaches originally included in the
project; the Caisse Centrale of France is financing 10 out of the remaining
15. Procurement of items in the credit has been substantially completed.



ANNEX II
Page 4
The review phase of technical assistance to the railway has been
concluded. However, implementation has only been partially carried out, and
it is now expected that this will be included in a future Second Railway
Project. Technical assistance to the Government in the transport planning
and coordination areas is about to be completed, with the conclusion of the
consultancy services by September 1978. The closing date was extended to
July 31, 1979 to allow completion of procurement.
Credit No. 506-MAG:       Village Livestock and Rural Development Project:
US$9.6 million credit of August 21, 1974; Date of
Effectiveness: June 17, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979.
The four-year project will assist traditional livestock in about
2,000 villages and provide rural infrastructure. In Majunga province, FAFIFAMA,
a parastatal agency, will develop livestock extension services, improve pasture
on about 10,000 ha, construct about 300 water points, improve and maintain
rural roads, construct village schools, and provide mobile health units. Pilot
community development, beef share fattening, and pig programs are provided in
the middle west. Technical assistance, training and future project prepara-
tion are included. By its very nature this is a complex project and difficult
to implement. It involves complementary activities in several sectors, in
large, sparsely-populated areas with exceptionally poor communications.
FAFIFAMA is a new organization, and its staff have limited project and ad-
ministrative experience.
The project encountered serious problems in the three years follow-
ing credit signature, and, principally because of legal and organizational
difficulties, little progress was made. Following significant changes in
institutional and management arrangements, the Credit Agreement was exten-
sively amended; the Amended Agreement became effective September 1, 1977.
The project's situation is much improved. FAFIFAMA, the principal
project implementing agency, is now well-established and operational, with a
near-full staff complement. Implementation of the project's most important
component - the development of veterinary and livestock services for village
producers - is proceeding well. Pasture improvement is also being undertaken.
Schools and health centers are being constructed, albeit behind schedule.
The development of water points and road improvement have not yet begun, but
detailed program planning is now underway and road equipment will be delivered
shortly. Cooperation with fokonolona institutions in all aspects of FAFIFAMA's
work is excellent. In the middle west, OMBY continues to provide extension
services to villages surrounding the ranches established under the IBRD-
financed Beef Cattle Development Project. The pilot pig program and ODEMO
cattle share fattening programs have not yet been started but financing and
administration arrangements have been worked out and the first loans to
farmers should be made in the next few months. The Government has selected
consultants for a study of cattle marketing and meat prices, and field work
for the study should begin almost immediately.

Loan No. 1065-MAG:        Forestry Project; US$6.75 million loan and US$6.76
Credit No. 525-MAG        million credit both of December 23, 1974; Date of
Effectiveness: July 8, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The project assists in the planting of 35,000 ha of pine plantations
as part of an overall planting program of 96,000 ha, which it is proposed will
eventually supply a future pulp mill to provide pulp for export. The planting
program is progressing according to the schedule and cost estimates are likely
to be in line with forecasts, despite a reorganization of the project which
entails more building and infrastructure than originally estimated, and
the need for more intensive soil preparation than foreseen at appraisal.
Technical difficulties which occurred at the early stages of the project now
appear to be resolved.
Credit No. 641-MAG:       Fourth Highways Project; US$22.0 million credit of
June 23, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: August 19,
1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The project assists the Government in the construction of two major
roads with a view to reducing transport costs and providing access to areas
with a high agricultural potential. It also includes training and strengthen-
ing of the country's road maintenance organization. Project implementari..Aon
is satisfactory.
Credit No. 663-MAG:       Second Education Project; US$14.0 million credit of
December 10, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: August 15,
1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is to assist the Government to decentralize educational
control and to improve the quality of basic education. It includes five
Regional Education Centres and vehicles for school inspectorate, one Teaching
Materials Production Centre and textbook development. Architectural work on
all project institutions is proceeding well. In addition, detailed opera-
tional planning for the Teaching Materials Production Center (CNaPMaD) is
being carried out actively. The two key technical advisors for this Center,
provided by ORT consultants, took up their positions in October 1977.
While the situation regarding architectural work on the project is
generally satisfactory, the Government appears to be falling behind on the
establishment of task forces for educational evaluation and sector review,
and the formulation of plans for educational decentralization. Furthermore,
books produced in Madagascar are slow in being delivered to schools because
of transport and other difficulties.
Norway has requested to participate for 50 percent in the project,
and an agreement to that effect was signed on December 16, 1977. The US$7.0
million of IDA monies thus saved is available for future projects in
Madagascar.
