IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
(Credit 1799-GUB)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Agricultural Services Project
in Guinea-Bissau, for which Credit 1799-GUB, in the amount of SDR 3.2 million (US$ 3.7 million)
equivalent was approved on May 21, 1987, and made effective on June 22, 1988.
The Credit was closed on September 30, 1994, compared with the original closing date of
December 31, 1991. It was fully disbursed, and the last disbursement took place on July 11, 1994.
Cofinancing for this project was provided by the Netherlands in the form of an additional Guilder 5
million Grant (US$ 2.5 million), administered by IDA.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Cheikh Sow and Mrs. Catherine Cassagne, former and
present Task Managers, Agriculture and Environment Division, Western Africa Department. It was
reviewed by Mr. Randolph Harris, Division Chief, and Mr. Jahangir Boroumand, Acting Operations
Adviser. The cofinancier did not provide written comments on the ICR.
Preparation of the ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision mission of
September 19, 1994. It is based on the Report and Recommendation of the President, the mid-term
review mission Aide-memoire and other material available in the project file, and the findings of two
completion missions, respectively in February and May 1995.  The borrower contributed to the
preparation of the ICR by preparing its own evaluation of the project's execution and achievements,
commenting on the draft ICR.

AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
(Credit 1799-GUB)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.            The Agricultural Services Project (PASA) constituted the Bank's first contribution to the
development of the agricultural sector in Guinea-Bissau. This relatively small country I had become
independent in 1974 but, for about a decade, had followed political and development choices giving ve7
little attention to agriculture, although this sector was - and still is - the country's most important one
In 1983, the Government defined for itself a market-oriented and agriculture-based development strategy -
including fishery and forestry - and the Bank started playing a key role in supporting the various aspects
of this strategy's implementation. Between 1983 and 1986, the Bank had participated in seven other
projects in the country totaling US$ 74.0 million, mainly in the areas of infrastructure and technical
assistance (to economic management, etc.). PASA remained the only project on the Bank's agricultural
portfolio while the staff of the Ministry of Rural Development and Agriculture (MDRA) was building up
its implementation capacity, as well as its ability to plan and prepare new projects.
2.            PASA originated from a 1983 FAO/CP review of the country's Agricultural Sector.
Project preparation was carried out by the Government of Guinea-Bissau through local working groups
which were assisted by consultants. An appraisal mission visited the country in November 1985 and
negotiations were completed in Washington on November 6, 1986. A Staff Appraisal Report was not
prepared for the project. Total Project costs were estimated at US$ 7.0 million. IDA was to finance SDR
3.2 million (or about US$ 3.7 million). The Dutch Government co-financed the project with Guilders 5
million (or US$ 2.5 million). The GGB's contribution was estimated at US$ 0.8 million equivalent. It
should be stressed that a great enthusiasm prevailed at the time PASA was designed and born, especially
on the part of the Bank, as the project constituted the first major step to open horizons of development
cooperation in the agricultural sector.
Project Objectives
3.            The original main Project objective was to build up, over a three-year period, the capacity
within the Ministry of Rural Development and Fisheries (MDRP - now divided in two separate ministries:
MDRA and MP) to: i) manage its human resources with particular attention to technical assistance; (ii)
plan activities in the agricultural sector and coordinate external aid; (iii) fulfill its technical role in the
different agriculture subsectors; and (iv) ensure monitoring of sectoral implementation and impact of the
Government's Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) of 1987-88. After the mid-term review, held in July
1991, these broad objectives were not changed, but, because of enormous delays and difficulties
I surface: 36,125 km2; population: approx. I million inhabitants today.
2 The primary sector - agriculture, fisheries and forestry only, in Guinea-Bissau - contributes 50% to GDP, constitutes almost 100% of exports
and 90% of employment.



- iii -
experienced until then in implementation, a narrowing of the project's scope was done through the
adoption of a "planning by objectives" method. A matrix was then established, outlining a dozen
expected results and corresponding needed activities to be developed, in top priority fields.
4.            Neither the initial broad objectives nor the expected results, following the mid-term
review (also called "objectives") were, in fact, really appropriate. The former because they were too
general and corresponded more to means than to ends. The latter because they were too narrow and,
although measurable, were not enough linked to the development of the agricultural sector, on which the
project was supposed to have a positive impact.
Implementation Experience and Results
5.            The proiect achieved part of its objectives as defined (whether in broad or reduced terms).
The project has mainly succeeded in creating a real planning capacity within the MDRA, in the form of a
unit - GAPLA - located out of the operational directorates and close to the Minister, composed of high
level staff. The MDRA has not, however, improved its management capacity. The unfinished building
for the MDRA offices, on one of Bissau's main streets, stands as very symbolic of the PASA's legacy.
The proiect's sustainabilitv is uncertain because most of the studies and recommendations it produced
remain unimplemented and GAPLA, the most visible apparent success, is relatively disconnected from the
rest of the MDRA and has very little impact on the ministry's management or on the way the agricultural
sector evolves.
6.            There was a significant difference between planned and actual distribution of costs. Table
6C shows that almost 30% more than estimated at appraisal was spent on categories 2 (vehicles,
equipment and furniture) and 3 (TA, training, studies and consultants). An important - but difficult to
estimate with precision - part of these two categories constitutes operating costs. The project was planned
to be implemented in 4.5 years, but, due to a very slow start - until mid-term review in July 1991 - it was
eventually closed only in September 1994.  After the mid-term  review, implementation progressed
smoothly and on schedule.
7.            Two key factors affected the achievement of the major objectives: (i) objectives were
achieved when very clearly translated into concrete expected results and when detailed activities to achieve
them were also very clearly defined. This happened after and thanks to the mid-term review. However,
(ii) the major obstacle to the achievement of the project's development objectives (institutional
strengthening) was the low rate of adoption and implementation of the proposals and recomnendations
generated by the project. For instance, a human resources management policy for the MDRA, with
detailed operational recommendations, was elaborated - as a proposal - under the project, aimed at
retaining qualified staff and increasing the degree of internalization of technical assistance - an important
factor affecting the project's sustainability. But such policy proposal was neither discussed nor considered
for approval. At least two successive documents proposing an agricultural policy were elaborated but
none was adopted.
8.            While certain elements of the Borrower's and the Bank's performance were satisfactory or
highly satisfactory - notably at the technical levels of the MDRA staff in carrying out different project
studies; and supervision, by the Bank, following the mid-term review - the performance of both the Bank
and the Borrower can be considered deficient, overall. On the Borrower's side, the decision levels were
well below expectation. In fact, although relatively well implemented, the project investments fell short
of impact because their benefits/results were not used or built on. On the Bank's side, the perfornance at



- iv -
identification and preparation was poor, but it was better during supervision and at completion. Partly
because no plan for the project's operational phase was adopted, the squandering of project benefits was
possible and indeed occurred.
Summary of Findings, Future Operation and Key Lessons Learned
9.             The overall project outcome is judged unsatisfactory, because, even if not precisely
calculated, there is a large disproportion between project costs and benefits. Also, an important part of
such benefits have not been utilized exactly as planned (for instance, trained staff not back in the country,
or not put in appropriate positions, or not utilized). The very good initial operation performance of the
Ministry of Fisheries and ANAG (National Farmers Association), after implementation of their respective
sub-components, is marginal to the PASA's main thrust and cannot change the overall judgement on the
outcome.
11.            Since a plan for the proiect's future operation had not been prepared 3, and because the
project's sustainability - closely related to the destiny of the agricultural sector as a whole - was a major
concern that motivated two completion missions, the Bank joined efforts with most of the other donors 4
to request that the Government prepare and adopt an agricultural sector development policy and a sound,
priority focused, medium term public investment program for the sector. The MDRA has agreed to lead
the elaboration of these, based on a broad consultation of the beneficiaries and in articulation with all the
major actors, including the other relevant ministries. The policy would clearly address, inter alia, the
respective roles of the public, private and non-profit (NGOs) institutions, a necessary clarification that
would set the stage for possible future Bank assistance to MDRA. Although it is difficult to define a
possible new Bank project before such policy and PIP are ready and approved by the Government, it is
possible to say that instead of yet another isolated "project", it would take the form of a direct and
integrated support to the implementation of the above mentioned sectoral PIP, through further institutional
strengthening of the existing line structures, building upon PASA's and other projects' results when
relevant, in close articulation with the other donors.
12.            Key lessons learned include, primno: the need for better project design and appraisal,
adequately addressing the issues that constitute all other key lessons in this paragraph, but particularly: (i)
the set up of realistic objectives - linked to the sector's development and addressing the farmers'needs; (ii)
the incorporation of provisions aimed at putting all project results into operation; (iii) the set up of an
efficient project monitoring (performance indicators), including the permanent monitoring of the impact on
beneficiaries; secundo: the need for Borrower's ownership of the project, at all stages, rather than reliance
on technical assistance or the Bank; tertio: the need, for the institution to be strengthened, to adopt, before
the project starts, a human resources management policy that will facilitate the retention of project
benefits; and the need to monitor such policy's implementation during the project's life; quarto: the need
not to take for granted that the Borrower's teams are familiar with the Bank's methods and procedures,
especially concerning accounting and procurement and thus plan for training in these fields; quinto: the
need, for the Borrower, as part of the elaboration of its agricultural policy, to sharpen its agricultural
research function and link between research, extension, and farmers.
3 It was not a legal requirement but the Bank encouraged the Borrower to prepare one.
4 The ICR of the PASA comes at a time when all the donors are expressing their concern about the imperiled sustainability of the projects they
have financed in the agricultural sector of Guinea-Bissau.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
(Credit 1799-GUB)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.    Project Objectives
1.            Project Objectives: The initial goal was to strengthen, over a period of three years,
the capacities of the former Ministry of Rural Development and Fisheries [MDRP, which has now been
divided into a Ministry of Rural Development and Agriculture (MDRA) and a Ministry of Fisheries
(MP)] in the following areas: (i) planning and management of human resources, with particular
emphasis on technical assistance; (ii) planning of interventions in the agricultural sector and
coordination of external aid; (iii) fulfilling its technical role in the various agricultural sub-sectors.
This strengthening of capacities was intended to enable the MDRP to monitor, in a proactive manner,
the reforms to be carried out in its sector in the framework of the Structural Adjustment Program for
1987-88.
2.            The mid-term review, carried out in July 1991, having noted some promising project
achievements after a slow and difficult start-up (especially the formulation, for the first time in Guinea-
Bissau, of a coherent agricultural development strategy and the creation of an efficient system of data
collection on fisheries), did not change the project's broad objectives. Instead, project interventions
were re-tailored to include a smaller number of means for achieving those ends. The mid-term review
mission recommended that project monitoring be improved through the application of the "planning by
5
objectives" method and it clearly defined and spelled out about 12 specific sub-components  based on
the agricultural development strategy 6
3.            Evaluation of Project Objectives: Concerning the project's broad initial objectives, it
is now possible (with hindsight) to judge them rather general, and to see that they appeared more as
means to an end, rather than true objectives in themselves. Institution-building should be linked to
monitorable indicators of sector performance.  In contrast, the objectives defined by the mid-term
review mission had a narrower meaning of "anticipated result" -- indeed, a short-term result -- for each
of the priority interventions recommended. Here again, one falls some distance short of an overview
of the sector's development as a whole. In addition, it would undoubtedly have been better to consider
acts of approval or implementation decisions as "expected results", instead of the studies, strategy
papers and other reports which, in and of themselves (unimplemented), cannot be considered "results".
B.    Achievement of Project Objectives
4.            Overall, the objectives as originally defined and as elaborated during the mid-term
review mission were partially achieved. Results were obtained that contributed in particular to a
strengthened capacity for planning within the MDRA and MP, as well as to launch a commercial
(autonomous) farmers organization (ANAG). The project's achievements are exhaustively listed in the
attached Government contribution. The following ones are noteworthy:
5 The total number of such sub-components is unclear as some appear as subsidiaries of others.
6 Such strategy was however never formally adopted.



- 2 -
(a)     A Human Resources Division (DRH), now  within the Directorate for Administrative
and Financial Services (DSAF), was created and its initial activities had the following
results: an inventory of personnel and positions was done, redundant positions were
eliminated, the payroll system was computerized; numerous managers and technicians
were trained, especially in the areas of project development, management and
monitoring (even though some of them  did not return to the institution 7); a fairly
detailed personnel management policy was formulated; the technical assistance received
by the Ministry was assessed and followed by a marked improvement in the efficacy of
this assistance, and a drastic reduction in the number of TA positions.
(b)     A  true planning  capacity  was set up  within the Planning  Department of MDRA
(GAPLA) and its initial activities resulted in the following: personnel were trained in
planning methodologies; the sector's public expenditures - in number of projects and
their total value 8 - were analyzed  and  reduced; the under-financed  sub-sectors
(livestock, forestry) were identified and appropriate reallocation of funds were done; a
number of studies were carried out.
(c)     An effective statistical system  was created and some basic studies and surveys were
completed: agricultural census ; statistics on fishing and fruit sub-sectors (e.g., a study
on mangoes and cashews, specifically requested and heeded; baseline study on
commercial agriculture (ponteiros 9); these activities, although isolated, made it
possible to strengthen the capacities of the division in charge of statistics within
"GAPLA", as well as the data processing center of the Ministry of Fisheries.
(d)     Dynamism  was injected  into commercial agriculture by the study on  "ponteiros";
indeed, following this very detailed study, a national farmers association (ANAG) was
created and workshops were held to inform farmers of commercial opportunities in
neighboring countries and in Portugal.
(e)     An initial agricultural development strategy was defined and numerous studies (some of
which were mentioned above) were carried out on various topics. After the mid-term
review, these studies appear to have emerged strictly from the recommendations and
priorities of the aforementioned strategy.
(f)     The National Institute for Agricultural Research (INPA) was created and its initial
activities produced a few promising results, especially with oil palms (introduction and
adaptation of varieties), fruits (at the Quebo center)'° and corn.
7 The seventh project accountant (after 6 had left) is however now responsible for the accounts and finances of the MDRA.
8 However, there are presently some large projects in the field in the agricultural sector that do not appear in MDRA's accounts or in project
lists drawn up by the Ministry of Plan.
9 A 'ponteiro" is the private owner of a 'ponta", which is a large agricultural property.
10 There is controversy, however, about the concrete results of this research, especially with regard to oil palms. This activity should be
monitored and the behavior of saplings distributed to farners observed.



- 3 -
(g)    The project also partially achieved its fourth initial objective, as it helped monitor and
implement the sectoral measures associated to the SAL; it however did so not for the
first tranche but for the following ones. A few results of the basic studies produced by
the PASA were utilized in macro-economic policy by the ministries of Finance and
Commerce.
C.    Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
5.            Project start-up was very slow until July 1991, when the mid-term review mission was
able to alleviate the main bottlenecks. The project could not start because of the total inexperience of
the existing institutions in project management, especially the ministry of agriculture for which, in
addition, investing in the sector's development was a brand new challenge. The project, the first of its
kind in Guinea Bissau, was complex and assumed at least some prior knowledge of basic procurement
methods and consultant recruitment procedures, knowledge which was in fact not there. The technical
assistance eventually contracted  1 by the Government to assist in project management did not
substantially change this fact. The mid-term review mission did much to remedy this situation by
reducing the scope of the project, cutting it down to a dozen clearly defined and signposted activities
and expected results. However, a number of factors hampered smooth execution.
6.             Factors that the Government could have influenced.
(a)    Overall, a lack of commitment and sense of responsibility left too large a role for
technical assistants, who in turn received inadequate guidance.
(b)    There has been a quasi permanent unavailability of counterpart funds, even after the
amendment of the Credit and Dutch Grant agreements in 1992, which enabled the two
sources to finance up to 75%  of recurrent costs and 95%  of the local costs of civil
works; the decline of the Guinean peso vis-a-vis the main hard currencies aggravated
this problem; it should be reported that, before the above mentioned amendment of the
Agreements, the Special Account of the project had shrunk to a minimum level and did
not operate for more than a year.
(c)    Failure to assign many of the persons trained under the project to positions and
responsibilities corresponding to their newly-acquired skills 2 prevented the project
benefits to multiply.
(d)    There was an excessive turnover of personnel; some staff in key project positions
changed too often, as they would leave civil service in search of better jobs (the
accountant changed seven times).
(e)    Some of the ministerial units involved in the project had difficulties with understanding
each other and cooperating with one another.
(f)    There was an overall inadequate knowledge and ability in project management, and
especially in disbursement procedures, accounting and procurement;  this caused
11 The procurement process for this first contract, the signature of which was a condition of effectiveness, took almost a year.
12 It proved extremely difficult to determine the exact percentage of personnel concemed by this.



- 4 -
considerable delays in project implementation, and also occasionnally resulted in
procurement of inappropriate services (especially as regards technical assistance); this
problem became less severe in the course of project implementation, but still persists
because of staff turnover.
7.               Factors related to the implementing agents.  Technical assistance was often ill-suited,
in terms of skills and/or language (with some notable exceptions).
8.               Other factors. A delay in disbursing the last tranche of the Dutch Grant also affected
the project implementation.
D.      Project Sustainability
9.               The project sustainability is uncertain because most of the project's accomplishments -
trained personnel, studies and policy proposals - were not followed by decisions and actions of
implementation, a prerequisite to sustainability. One striking example is the failure to implement the
policy on human resource management, which provides for the recruitment, training and retention of
personnel of the quality required and in the quantities needed.  Without such a policy  applied,
institution-building in Guinea Bissau's agricultural sector is just too daunting a challenge and any
project in this field cannot have any visible long-term impact.
10.              Instead  of  tackling  the  implementation   of  studies  or  taking   advantage  of
accomplishments or investments already carried out, studies and training simply continued. Thus,
instead of the 200 man-months of training envisaged (including 50 trips abroad), there were 521 man-
months (including 94 trips abroad); 20 studies were done instead of the 10 that had been planned.
Finally, although it is good to have used local consultants in place of the foreign technical assistance
that had been originally envisaged, it is unfortunate that a good number of these consultants played
roles that should have been filled by employees of the MDRA itself.13
11.              In addition, there is nothing to guarantee that the relevant ministries -- MDRA and MP
-- will be able to sustain the effort without supplemental help. Only projects financed, one after the
other, by the various donors are paying most of MDRA's recurrent costs, including salary supplements
for civil          14.  MDRA's non-project work is negligible and the sector's program  of public
investment is little more than a list of different projects financed by different donors, without ties to
the planning function. The PASA has put certain tools in place, has trained people, developed
policies, strategies and regulatory texts and action plans; but what still remains to be done is to apply
all of that and get the system up and running.
13 Fewer man-months of foreign technical assistance were used than had been foreseen, but considerably more local consultants were used
(165 man-months rather than the 0 envisaged, not including services rendered by local firms - see Table 5). This was certainly all to the
good for the local firms and consultants, but did not enhance the sustainability or impact of the project.
4The fact that it is not possible to pay salary supplements with IDA funds undoubtedly contributed to the high turnover of most of the civil
servants assigned to the project and to the excessive use of local consultants. This is not a problem with the niles on the use of IDA funds.
but rather a basic problem , in Guinea-Bissau, of financial resources raising and national budget allocation.

12.            The following sustainability assessments can be made, for some of the main results:
(a)    Civil works: The construction of MDRA's office is about 2/3 completed. Counterpart
funds have been inadequate and the devaluation of the local currency has exacerbated
the situation.
(b)    Human resources:  Neither the database about MDRA personnel, nor the document
containing detailed proposals for a personnel management policy, nor another
containing a proposed method of evaluating employees of the MDRA has been used.
Only the computerized salary and payment system works (when paychecks are issued).
(c)    Support for statistics:  The investments in equipment, material and some training
yielded good results, at the MDRA as well as at the MP. Regular figures are issued on
the production and prices of main crops and specific studies are sometimes carried out.
However, the long term survival of these statistics systems and centers depends upon
demand. But, for the moment, these systems can only function with supplemental aid
from donors, through projects, and it seems that the main "demanders" are other
projects.
(d)    Creation of ANAG: To the PASA's credit, this accomplishment, which cost very little,
is undoubtedly the one that has had the greatest impact and whose sustainability is most
obvious. ANAG is a very dynamic, market oriented, autonomous, association and its
operation costs are paid by members' dues, including of smallholders.
(e)    Planning capacity of GAPLA:  The sustainability of the investments devoted to
GAPLA is compromised, since it is not used by MDRA for planning purposes, and
because the things that it does plan are rarely implemented and then only when related
to ad hoc projects taken over by other donors. GAPLA is practically the only entity
with credibility vis-a-vis donors and cooperative agencies 15 but this sparks institutional
jealousy. In the wake of the last institutional reorganization decreed by the Minister,
GAPLA has found itself even more isolated.
(f)    Creation of INPA and the results of research: An autonomous national agricultural
research institute, INPA, was created in 1993. The fruit research and development at
Quebo and upland food crops research at Contuboel produced results, some of which
have had an impact (some of the seedlings received by 300 farmers are in production;
two varieties of corn were adapted with a 30%  rate of adoption).  But, overall,
research has had a very limited impact and the benefits to farmers are not apparent.
Agronomic research in Guinea Bissau still needs to concentrate on the essentials and to
specialize, and the newly created national extension service awaits assistance to start
operating.
(g)    Forestry activities:  The project support of activities in forestry had very limited
impact on raising of nursery plants in relation to reforestation, except in the case of oil
15 which tend to use GAPLA personnel for a number of other tasks such as project coordination. Some members of GAPLA,
understandably, take on second jobs in their off hours in order to supplement their salary which is barely adequate to buy one bag of rice per
month.

palms. A law on forestry, a forestry taxation system and a forestry policy remained as
drafts.
(h)    Fisheries:  The present performance of the Ministry of Fisheries is another positive
item on the list of sustainable investments of the PASA. Although four of the 5 staff
trained from the Center management had left the institution, one has now come back,
attracted by the dynamism of the unit and a better remuneration. With articulated
assistance from other donors to the implementation of a comprehensive, integrated,
sector policy and action program prepared by this ministry, that involves sound
institutional reform, a better channeling and use of funds generated by the sector, and a
more sustainable use of the fisheries resources, the few seeds left by the PASA
contributed to an overall sustainable undertaking.
(i)    Livestock Production: the two studies produced by the PASA have formed the bases
for the preparation of livestock production projects on a pilot basis in two towns,
Bissora and Gabu, representing Balanta and Fula production systems, respectively.
These await to be considered for support.
(j)    Irrigation:  the activities carried out by the PASA under this component, aimed at
doubling the annual rice harvest (national survey that identified 30 bottom-lands
suitable for irrigation; topographic surveys in some of the latter; pilot irrigation tests
in one site near Gabu), had no impact except some land tenure conflicts.
E.     Bank Performance
13.            Three phases of the Bank performance may be distinguished: phase one, from
identification to signature, including design, preparation and appraisal; phase two, corresponding to
supervision from signature to mid-term review; and phase three, supervision from the mid-term review
to completion. During the first two phases, the Bank's performance can be characterized as deficient,
overall. The project was not thoroughly prepared or appraised. The Bank then considered, with
reason, that such an investment project was a key instrument to start implementing the - also Bank
recommended - transition towards a market-oriented agriculture-based economy and, as such, was a
necessary companion piece to the first SAL. However, the Bank misjudged the conditions prevailing
in the country at the time of project design, underestimated the need for Borrower ownership and,
instead of genuinely helping the Government find an appropriate solution, insisted that expatriate
technical assistants do the job that the Government lacked the experience to do. It was even included
in project design that a technical assistance firm would be delegated the project management and would
start by further defining the project, a task that should have been done through adequate preparation
and appraisal. Even after the project became effective 16 and the technical assistance proved unable to
solve the main problem, the Bank lacked the flexibility, adaptability and decisiveness needed to
promote a project change. However the Bank performance can be rated as satisfactory during and after
the mid-term review mission, which stands out as having had a different, more lucid, approach. From
then on supervision became more helpful and a better dialogue with the Government was maintained
until completion.
16 A major reorganization of the Bank affected its perforriiance during 1987 and part of 1988, by delaying all on-going activities and
diverting the staff's attention for about 6 months.

F.      Borrower Performance
14.            Overall, the performance of the borrower can also be rated as deficient with nuances
corresponding to the same above three phases. It did not do much to assume ownership of the project,
especially at design and preparation, and roughly until the mid-term  review.  The borrower is
responsible in particular for not having made the decisions necessary for the implementation of the
PASA's policies, studies and recommendations, which accumulated without receiving any operational
follow-up. This attitude, aggravated at and after completion, is considered the main reason for the
project's lack of sustainability. The borrower's financial performance during and after implementation
also stands out as particularly weak. The two final audit reports (for the accounts closed on December
31, 1993; and September 30, 1994) are still overdue at the time of this report, despite repeated
reminders in which the Government was informed it could jeopardize future lending to the sector.
However, the borrower's performance deserves better rating in implementation after the mid-term
review, not only as a result of the review but also because the Government then decided to take
ownership of the project, ended a number of inefficient expatriate consultants' contracts and carried out
all activities jointly defined during the mid-term review mission.
G.      Assessment of Outcome
15.            The overall project outcome is unsatisfactory  because the main objectives - of
institutional building - were only partially achieved, a great deal of the benefits were diluted, the
project sustainability is uncertain, but US$ 7.5 million equivalent were spent. Even if the costs and
benefits were not precisely quantified, the project's cost-effectiveness can be judged as insufficient.
Furthermore, unless decisions are taken without delay to implement the studies, policies and other
achievements of the PASA, an even larger part of its benefits could well vanish.
H.      Future Operation
16.            A plan for the project's future operation was not prepared, as it had not been legally
agreed. In the case of the PASA - or any other institution-building project - "operation" would mean
the adequate utilization of trained staff and the approval and implementation of the studies and policies
produced. It is still possible however (within a reasonable time frame) that appropriate decisions be
made by the Government and that the PASA's accomplishments be exploited for the development of
the sector. The elaboration process of the ICR was an instrument of dialogue with the Government to
this end, but only a future observation (e.g., through an impact evaluation) may fully answer the
question.
17.            Since the discouraging results of the PASA added to those of most other rural sector
projects 17 in Guinea-Bissau, the donor community'8 has approached the MDRA as a group.  As a
result of the dialogue, the MDRA has agreed to lead a national participatory process to prepare an
agricultural sector development policy and a sound, priority-focused, medium term public investment
program  (PIP) for the sector. 9   The policy  would be based  on a broad  consultation of the
17 According to many evaluation reports, such projects were especially those of an integrated type, very large sized and based on a
particular geographic area; and essentially because they attempted to apply "imported" concepts, with a lack of participation of the
beneficiaries.
18 And especially the World Bank, EEC, the Swedish, French and Dutch cooperation's, UNDP, FAO, USAID and EFAD
19 The Bank informed the MDRA that such policy and PIP would serve the purpose of a plan for project operation.

beneficiaries20 and would address basic crucial issues such as: land tenure policy; the respective roles
of the public, private and non-profit sectors in agricultural services; the difference in approach needed
for the adequate treatment of both subsistence and cash crops, small holders and ponteiros, and the
three - agricultural, pastoral, forest - domains.
18.           The precise content of future Bank support for the sector will be defined once the
above policy and PIP are ready and approved by the Government. It was originally envisaged that two
different projects would be undertaken in the rural sector, after the PASA: one aimed at solving basic
problems related to natural resource management, and another that would continue to support the
agricultural sector institutions, covering a range of agricultural services and building on the results of
the PASA. It is presently envisaged that there would be a single, government-led investment program
for which key donors would provide integrated support, and which would be implemented in
accordance with common procedures, rather than as isolated "projects", as has been the case to date.
I.     Key Lessons Learned
19.           Better Project Design and Preparation.
(a)    Realistic and precise development objectives must be defined, as a framework for the
results anticipated for each activity or component, and tied to monitorable performance
indicators - here, of the agricultural sector's development.
(b)    The beneficiaries and/or the main target groups must be consulted and must participate
in the project preparation; any contradiction between the opinions of the beneficiaries
and/or target groups and those of the Government must be resolved before project
appraisal; a consultation process allows to set objectives that correspond to actual
needs and prevents from making a number of mistakes, such as, for instance, the
failure to take account of land tenure issues (a lesson learned from the pilot irrigation
project).
(c)    The project must constitute a logical whole with a high degree of internal coherence
rather than be a disparate series of activities strung together; the pre-existence of a
sectoral policy and detailed strategy is a significant asset.
(d)    The required official decisions - to apply recommendations generated by the project,
approve and implement strategies and policies developed under the project, etc. -
should be anticipated at appraisal. If need be, legal covenants requiring such acts of
approval should be included in the credit agreement as milestones in the
implementation process. Part of this need can be addressed by the preparation and
adoption of a plan for the project's operation. However, in the case of an institution-
building project - as the PASA - operation is a continuous process throughout the
project, not a chronological second phase after implementation.
(e)    The project must include a simple but effective system of monitoring and evaluation, to
be set up from the beginning and constantly used as a management tool; to be most
effective, this system should be defined and set up in a participatory manner at
20 A comprehensive national survey is on-going, with FAO's support.

appraisal; the system should be based on the sector performance indicators including
indicators of the beneficiaries' satisfaction.
20.           Borrower's Ownership.
(a)    The Government must truly "own" the project from the beginning, and must react
immediately to the slightest "slippage"; this responsibility should not be delegated to
technical assistants or transferred to the Bank or other donor.
(b)    Close attention should be given by the Borrower - who drafts them - and the Bank -
who reviews them  - to the terms of reference of technical assistants - whether
expatriate or local - and to the monitoring of their performance.  Missions should
preferably be of short duration (although the same specialist may have to intervene
regularly) and targeted at specific technical issues (not project management).
21.            Better Monitoring of the Human Resources Capacity Building and Performance.
(a)    It is important to also provide for the monitoring of the individual and collective
performance of the human resources assigned to the project, including the project
permanent staff, over and above the technical assistants.
(b)    Care should be taken that the structure of salaries and other benefits of project
personnel does not run counter to project sustainability; hence, base salaries of civil
servants should be sufficiently attractive and consultants' salaries should not be vastly
larger than theirs. At the same time, it should be ascertained that personnel trained by
the project will stay with the project or be assigned to posts for which they have been
trained.
22.            Upfront training in Important Aspects of Proiect Management and Bank Guidelines.
Accounting and financial management, as well as procurement and general project management
capacity, must be duly internalized by the borrower's teams. The World Bank should ensure that this
happens and organize the required training seminars and arrange for the translation of relevant
documents -- manuals and directives -- into Portuguese.
23.            Sharpening the Research and Extension Linkages.
Agricultural research must be linked to field realities: on the one hand it must disseminate its results
and, on the other hand it must be poised to listen to and observe farmers in order to provide feedback
to research.  In a country like Guinea Bissau, it is advisable to limit agronomic research to the
"applied" and "adaptive" categories.  Extension should be seen as a the necessary intermediary
instrument between research and the farmers (a clearly missing link in the case of PASA).

2 3 It is estimated that only 5,000 of these plants remained at the research station. These in-vitro plants were imported without adequate
training of the research staff to handle the plants. This resulted in a loss of 97% of the plants.
The impact of the Embunhe's nursery for other plants was dismal because of lack of forestry action plan.
Trials were conducted on the following: 10 varieties of sorghum, 6 of millet, 8 of maize. 6 of cassava, 6 of sweet potatoes, 10 of
beans, and 6 of soybean.

PASA
IDA Credit 1799-GUB
Dutch Grant No. 2457 GUB
Implementation Completion Mission
(February 1 - 8, 1995)
Aide-Memoire
A World Bank mission composed of Mme./Messrs. Cheikh Sow (Leader / Agricultural Economist),
Chandra Pattanayak (Agronomist) and Lucie Tran (Operations Analyst), visited Guinea-Bissau from
February 1 to 8, 1995 to jointly carry out along with Government Officials an Implementation
Completion Mission of the Agricultural Services Support Project (PASA) financed by the World Bank /
IDA, the Government of the Netherlands and the Government of Guinea-Bissau. The objective of the
mission was to undertake a complete assessment of PASA's achievements in reaching the goals set
during project appraisal of 1986 and Mid-Term Review of 1991. The mission's terms of reference is
detailed in the Statement of mission objectives of January 25, 1995. The mission would like take this
opportunity to thank the Bank's Resident Mission and the Government of Guinea-Bissau for their
assistance during the mission. This aide-memoire summarizes the mission's findings which were
discussed with Government officials (Messrs. C. Amarante, Director GAPLA; H. Mendes, Directorate of
Livestock; A. Sani, Directorate of Forestry; and P. Lopes Jr., Human Resources Division, GAPLA) prior
to mission's departure from the country.
Assessment of Overall Project's Performance
PASA has experienced a slow start-up and ineffective implementation during the first three years of the
project's life. After the July 1991 Mid-Term Review (MTR), considerable accomplishments were
recorded by the project. The project has enhanced its capacity to analyze and plan the agricultural
sector's activities. PASA's Human Resources Division has completed an inventory of staff of the
Ministry of Rural Development and Agriculture (MDRA) which has resulted in the elimination from
MDRA's payroll of many ghost employees. A wide variety of training activities were designed to
upgrade the skills of MDRA's staff. The project also assisted MDRA's Statistical Division in carrying
out key data collection and studies in the agricultural sector. Technical Departments of MDRA were
also strengthened and their achievements are presented below.

Human Resources Development and Training
Despite some progress on the human resources aspect of the project, a lot remains to be done. A
Human Resources Division (HRD) has been created within GAPLA and more than US$700,000 were
allocated to strengthen personnel management and training of MDRA staff. With the objective of
rationalizing staff strength in the MDRA, the HRD has prepared an inventory of staff, and action has
been taken to correct redundancies. A draft on personnel policy, including analysis of job profiles,
evaluation of performance and terms of employment, has been finalized, but it should be discussed with
the authorities. While these developments are appreciable, there are several issues which have not yet
been addressed: (i) the criteria for the selection of candidates for training; (ii) a master plan on human
resources requirement; (iii) non-return of overseas trained staff, (iv) recruitment of Government staff as
local consultants at significantly higher salaries than current Government salaries; and (v) the risk of
reduced effectiveness of HRD if the proposed merger with the Administration and Finance Department
takes effect.
Under the project, a variety of training activities have been carried out. There were in-country training
sessions on the planning and management of the projects, finance, and human resources along with data
processing application in these three areas. Furthermore, there were a number of training activities
within and outside the country on technical subjects. In particular, there were significant training
activities after the Mid-Term Review in 1991. There were 210 man-months of overseas training for 175
persons, 201 man-months of courses, offered in Bissau, to 470 persons and 110 man-months of short-
term courses offered abroad to 80 persons. However, there is no record to indicate that staff, having
received a specialized training, continue to work in the same specialty after the training.
Agricultural Research and Extension
The project has assisted the national agricultural research activity in several ways. It supported the
studies by three external consultants for three man-months on future plans for agricultural research and
by one local consultant for two man-months on fruit crops research. As a result of these studies, the
autonomous national agricultural research institute, INPA, was created, succeeding the formcr DEPA of
MDRA. Furthermore, the project has supported DEPA/INPA's on-going effort on fruit research at
Quebo and upland food crops research at Contubuel. At Quebo, the assistance was for the supply of
vehicles, tractor, and irrigation equipment, which amounted to one-third of the total investment on
physical facility at Quebo. The assistance at Contubuel was on laboratory equipment, generator and
operational support for field trials. Despite these and other assistance at both of these research centers,
the benefits to the farmers during the project period was negligible. There was the problem of general
management at Quebo, and the leadership of external technical assistance was questionable. The three
technicians trained with the support of the project funds, upon return from training in Brazil, have not
been posted at Quebo. We realize that getting research results in the field takes time. However, INPA
should have developed a time-bound plan for transferring results to the farmers' fields.
The creation of INPA without the presence of a strong national extension system will be
counterproductive. DEPA's accomplishments were limited because it was involved in both research and
extension. Initiating a national extension system and linking it with INPA is a topmost priority. To
address this issue, the newly created Directorate of Rural Promotion and Extension should be
strengthened. INPA deserves support on short- and long-term training of research staff and on the
introduction of improved germplasm of crop plants and livestock.



3
Livestock studies
The project supported two valuable studies on the livestock sector-- one on livestock production
systems and the other on socioeconomic study of animal health. External (25 man-months) and local (36
man-months) consultants were involved in the execution of these studies. The reports of these studies
have formed the bases for the preparation of livestock production projects on a pilot basis in two towns,
Bissora and Gabu, representing Balanta and Fula production systems, respectively. These development
projects envisage actions integrating natural resources conservation, fodder and fuel production, farmer
education on livestock health and production, farmer access to vaccines and improved fodder plant
material and marketing of animal products. This proposal for a pilot project has come at an opportune
time, particularly after the recent creation of herders' associations in the regions. We commend this
approach and strongly recommend Bank support for implementation.
Forestry activities,
The project support on activities in forestry had no impact in raising nursery plants in relation to
reforestation, except in the case of oil palms. Apart from this, a number of studies were taken up in
relation to a draft law on forestry, forestry taxation system and forestry policy. The nursery activity on
oil palms, aimed at renewal of old palm groves in the northern area of the country, had shown a
measurable progress. The seeds of an improved variety, Tenera, was introduced from Cote d' Ivoire and
the seedlings were raised in the nurseries in Embunhe, Cachungo and Bula. Although this variety had not
been tested in the country for its wide adaptation, initial performance of about 50,000 seedlings, supplied
to commercial and smallholder farmers and grown under lowland conditions and recommended cultural
practices, was satisfactory and there are indications that it will significantly outyield the local varieties.
T his positive performance, if found to be stable over time and space, will offer a great opportunity for its
wide cultivation. However, before such a venture is considered, a study should be initiated to seek
answers to a series of questions: (i) the institution(s) that should host the research and development
activities on oil palm, (ii) the total area, existing and potential, under this crop, (iii) the number of
farmers that can benefit from this development, (iv) the potential for improvement in local oil extraction
practices, and (v) the cost of production and its competitiveness with other edible oil in the domestic and
global markets.
Irrigation Activities
PASA benefited from institutional support of expatriate consultants (EUROCONSULTS) to develop
small-scale irrigation schemes in the low-lands ("Bas-fonds") of the country. This support, under the
form of equipment and training for the Irrigation Department staff of MDRA, is of special relevance to
the national goal of food security in view of its potential for establishing a second crop of rice under
irrigation during the dry season. It resulted in the identification and survey of 30 Bas-fonds sites for
which hydrologic and pedologic surveys were carried out. Topographic surveys were only carried out for
a limited number of the Bas-fonds. Under PASA, the Irrigation Department also conducted pilot
irrigation tests in Gabu with water control, agronomic and socio-economic activities. The impact of this
project component was limited as staff sent on training overseas did not return and land tenure issues
were not addressed. The lesson learned here is that PASA could have a greater impact in this sub-sector
if clear termns of reference and realistic objectives were prepared well in advance and agreed with
Government. The mission also observed that the Department has not yet developed a master plan for
irrigation development.

Civil Works
PASA was initially to construct four houses for the long term technical assistance team. In 1989, the
Governnent requested to have instead office space for its staff. The planning process of the construction
of the buildings to house MDRA was long. As a result, the buildings remain partially completed because
funds ear-marked for this civil works were depleted. The financing gap is about US$ 408,000. The
mission urged the Government to secure other sources of financing to complete the civil works. This
component is the least successful of the project as other funds are not yet available for complete the civil
works. and the buildings are unusable.
Outstanding Audits
The mission discussed with the project management and the accounting unit the need to finalize and
submit to the Bank the audit report for the year ending December 31, 1993 which has already been
contracted to Coopers & Lybrand-Dieye, Senegal. This report was due on June 31, 1994. Coopers &
Lybrand-Dieye has submitted the draft audit to the Borrower for comment, following which the report
should be finalized as promptly as possible. The mission stressed the importance of receiving the
overdue audits to reduce the likelihood of delays in processing future Bank operations in the sector. The
mission also followed up on progress made in implementing the Bank's recommendations to correct
defaults in the financial and accounting areas mentioned in the auditor's report for year ending December
31, 1992.  Agreement was also obtained from the Borrower to allow mission members to meet with
Coopers & Lybrand-Dieye, Senegal, on the quality and substance of the audits submitted thus far. Since
the project was closed on September 30, 1994, and is fully disbursed, no funds remain under the project
to fund the final audit on the project for the period January 1 to September 30, 1994. This audit is due
by March 31, 1995. The mission obtained agreement this audit will be paid for by the Borrower.
Procurement
The mission also met with GAPLA's procurement unit, which is staffed with three persons responsible
for procurement from the preparation of bidding documents through to contract signature. Various
procurement matters were discussed to determine where the Borrower's needs can be better met and to
determine the reasons for delay in the procurement of civil works, specifically the construction of the
Ministry of Rural Development. The mission found that the Borrower lacked updated documentation in
some cases (standard bidding documents instead of sample bidding documents), others were not available
(directives on selection of consultants), and some not in the language needed. The documents needed will
be sent to the project unit upon the mission's return to headquarters. Some of the problems that the
Borrower raised concerned lack of familiarity with procurement terminology in English and translation
problems into French or Portuguese. The Borrower also found that the Bank's directives were not clear
on how to solve certain procurement problems, e.g., when bids from two different parties are scored the
same points, and that others were not available, e.g., criteria for selection of goods and works, and
consultants. Delays in the construction of the Ministry was due to the lengthy preparation process for
such works and to administrative and legal delays on both the part of the Borrower and the Bank. These
experiences have been valuable in helping to avoid similar occurrences in the future. Further Bank
procurement training, particularly the training of trainers would be useful for updating procurement
information and discussing specific procurement issues relevant to the Borrower's needs.

sur la mission que nous comptons envoyer a Bissau, au mois de mai prochain.
A l'heure ou~ le Gouvernement de la Guinee Bissau semble
souhaiter poursuivre l'effort entrepris lors du PASA, qu'il considere globalement positif,
la Banque mondiale s'inquiete, quant a elle, de l'impact effectif de ce projet sur le
developpement du secteur agricole du pays. Cet impact semble, justement, difficile a
determiner. Or il nous paraeit fondamental de s'en preoccuper avant d'&re en mesure de
definir une quelconque operation suivante. Dans l'ensemble, le PASA a finance une
profusion d'etudes et d'activites diverses, voire disparates - y compris un batiment
inacheve (et en tant que tel, inutile) pour le MDRA. Mais en quoi la production, la
productivit6 et/ou les rendements agricoles, le revenu global du secteur, celui des paysans
et/ou leurs conditions de travail, ou un quelconque autre parametre susceptible de
renseigner sur la sante de ce secteur (independamment de tout facteur de risque externe),
se sont-ils ameliores, ou donnent-ils ne serait-ce que des signes precurseurs
d'amelioration, en consequence du projet? Meme si, comme le souligne le Gouvernement

dans son evaluation ', on peut discuter des criteres d'analyse, vous conviendrez que la
question est importante. Elle est, pour nous, en tout cas, au coeur du probleme qui se pose
aujourd'hui, et ce dont devrait traiter le Rapport d'achevement du projet.
Nous vous prions de croire, d'ailleurs, qu'il ne s'agit pas de faire un
quelconque proces. Nous souhaitons plutot par IA tirer les le,ons qui s'imposent autant
pour le Gouvernement que pour la Banque mondiale ou pour les autres bailleurs de fonds
(notamment, en l'occurrence, les Pays Bas), afin que nous nous am6liorions tous. C'est
pour cela qu'il est tellement important que nous fassions cet exercice ensemble, comme
cela a d'ailleurs commence, lors de la mission de fevrier. Et il est, par exemple, tout aussi
important de juger de l'execution du projet et de sa portee, que des documents initiaux qui
etaient senses le definir.
Rappelons d'abord les principaux obiectifs de ce projet (dont
l'accord de credit, signe en mai 1987, prevoyait la cl6ture en decembre 1990). Il s'agissait
initialement de renforcer, sur une p6riode de trois ans, la capacite du Ministere du
developpement rural et peches (MDRP, aujourd'hui scind6 en deux: le MDRA et le MP)
A: (i) planifier et gerer ses ressources humaines, en portant une attention particuliere A
l'assistance technique; (ii) planifier les activites du secteur agricole et coordonner l'aide
externe; (iii) remplir son r6le technique dans les differents sous-secteurs agricoles. Ce
renforcement de capacite devait permettre au MDRP de suivre activement, pour son
secteur, les reformes a operer dans le cadre du programme d'ajustement structurel (pour
1987-88).
La revue A mi-parcours du projet, en juillet 1991, apres constat de
quelques realisations prometteuses (notamment la formulation, pour la premi&e fois en
Guinee Bissau, d'une strat6gie de developpement agricole coherente et la mise en place
d'un systeme performant de collecte de donnees sur les peches), malgre un tres lent et
difficile demarrage, n'a pas change les grands objectifs du projet. Plutot, elle a recentre
1'action sur un nombre plus reduit de moyens d'y arriver, en definissant clairement, basees
sur la strategie de developpement agricole, 10 A 12 sous-composantes A realiser. De plus,
la mission de revue A mi-parcours a preconise F'am6lioration du suivi du projet par
l'application d'une methode dite de "planification par objectif'.
Sur les grands objectifs initiaux du projet, nous pouvons deja faire
un premier commentaire: ils nous semblent assez vagues, tout en ressemblant plut6t a des
moyens qu'A de veritables objectifs. Le renforcement institutionnel, vous en conviendrez,
n'est pas une fin en soi mais, justement, un moyen pour parvenir A des ameliorations en
matiere de developpement, mesurables en termes de volumes et/ou de valeurs (meme s'ils
sont d'ordre qualitatif et compte duiment tenu de possibles facteurs externes, tels que les
alias climatiques ou autres). Nous aurions certainement moins de difficultes aujourd'hui si
les objectifs avaient et mieux definis. Sur les objectifs tels que definis par la mission de
revue A mi-parcours, nous pensons qu'ils ont un sens plus etroit de "r6sultat attendu" - et

ce, A court terme - pour chacune des activites recommandees. Ici encore, on est loin de
pouvoir apprecier le developpement du secteur dans son ensemble.
Pourtant, avec des objectifs tels que definis alors, aussi bien
initialement que par la mission de revue A mi-parcours, et compte tenu du fait que ce
departement ministeriel partait, pour ainsi dire, de rien, force nous est de constater que les
objectifs ont et en partie atteints. En effet, des resultats ont et obtenus qui vont dans le
sens du renforcement de la capacite de planification et de gestion du MIDRA et du MP.
Nous retiendrons surtout les suivants:
-      la creation de la division des ressources humaines (DRH) et le
resultat de ses premieres activites: inventaire du personnel et des postes et elimination des
postes redondants; formation de nombreux cadres et techniciens, notamment en
formulation, gestion et suivi de projets - bien qu'une partie d'entre eux ne soit pas revenue
A l'institution; formulation d'une politique de gestion du personnel assez d6taillee;
evaluation de l'assistance technique re,ue par le Ministere, suivie d'une am6lioration
sensible de l'efficacite de cette assistance (et une reduction drastique du nombre des
postes);
-      les premiers resultats de la planification sectorielle au sein de
"GAPLA": personnel forme en planification; analyse et reduction des depenses publiques
du secteur, en nombre de projets et en valeur totale; identification des sous-secteurs sous-
finances (elevage, forets) et debut de re6quilibrage;
-      la mise en place et le debut du suivi d'un systeme performant de
statistiques et la realisation de quelques enquetes et etudes de base: recensement agricole;
statistiques des sous-secteurs de la peche et de la production fruitiere; 6tude de base sur
l'agriculture commerciale (ponteiros); ces activites ont notamment permis de renforcer
durablement la capacite de la division chargee de la statistique au sein de "GAPLA";
-      le dynamisme specifiquement insuffle A l'agriculture commerciale
par l'etude sur les ponteiros; en effet, suite A cette etude tres detaillee, une association des
agriculteurs commerciaux (ANAG) s'est creee et des ateliers se sont tenus visant A
informer les agriculteurs des opportunites commerciales dans les pays voisins et au
Portugal;
-     I' elaboration d'une strategie de developpement agricole et la
realisation de nombreuses etudes (dont certaines dejA mentionnees ci-dessus) sur divers
sujets. Apres la revue A mi-parcours, ces etudes ont decoule strictement des
recommandations et priorites de la strategie ci-dessus; des projets pilote ont pu &re lances
A la suite de certaine de ces etudes (toujours en application d - la strategie), notamment en
matiere d'elevage;



S.E. Dr. Isaac Monteiro                       -4-                  le 17 avril 1995
-     le debut d'une activite de recherche agronomique apres la creation
de l'INPA et quelques resultats prometteurs, notamment en matiere de palmier a huile
(introduction et adaptation d'une variete) et culture fruitiere (au centre de Quebo).
En resume, la capacite de planification, plus que celle de gestion, a
ete renforcee, mais ceci de fa,on encore fiagile. La question de la durabilite du projet est
essentielle lorsqu'on s'interroge sur ses accomplissements. Car, en realite, nous devons
regretter que les acquis listes ci-dessus n'aient pas ete immediatement suivis de decisions
et d'actions confirmant les directions prises ou appliquant les recommandations. Citons la
non mise en oeuvre de la politique de gestion des ressources humaines comme, A notre
avis 1'element le plus determinant de l'impact du projet. Sans l'application de cette
politique, qui prevoit des mesures pour recruter, former et retenir du personnel en quantite
et qualite necessaires et suffisantes, ce qui justement pose un enorme probleme
aujourd'hui, nous ne pensons pas pouvoir parler serieusement de renforcement
institutionnel.
De surcrolt, rien ne permet vraiment d'assurer que les departements
ministeriels concernes pourront poursuivre l'effort entrepris sans appui supplementaire.
On a mis en place certains outils; on a fait des etudes de base, on a forme des gens, on a
e1abore des politiques, strategies, textes legaux et plans d'action: a present, il faut mettre
tout cela en application et faire fonctionner le systeme. La capacite du MDRA et du MP a
cela reste encore a demontrer. La durabilite du projet, A notre avis, peut etre qualifi6e
d'incertaine.
Pourquoi ces resultats mitiges et ce doute? A notre avis, la volonte
politique d'operer des reformes fondamentales a fait defaut. D'autre part, parmi les
facteurs specifiquement lies a 1'execution elle-meme du projet, qui ont fait obstacle au bon
d6roulement de celui-ci, nous retenons les suivants:
Du fait plut6t du Gouvernement:
-     de facon g6nerale, un manque d'engagement et de prise de
responsabilite qui a notamment laisse un trop large r6le A I'assistance technique, laquelle
s'est retrouvee insuffisamment encadree;
-     la non disponibilite quasi permanente des fonds de contrepartie,
m8me apres l'amendement des accords de credit et de don hollandais, en 1992, qui a
permis que le credit et le don hollandais financent jusqu'A 75% des couits recurrents et
95% des couts locaux des travaux de genie civil; le declin du peso guineen par rappert aux
principales devises a aggrave ce probleme;
-      le fait que qu'une partie non negligeable des ressources humaines
formees par le projet n'aient pas ensuite ete affectees aux postes et r6les correspondant a
leur capacites acquises;



S.E. Dr. Isaac Monteiro                       -5-                   le 17 avril 1995
-     la trop grande rotation du personnel, certains cadres affectes a
differents postes cles au sein du projet ont change trop souvent (le comptable a change
sept fois);
-     une connaissance et capacite insuffisantes en matiere de gestion de
projets, et particulierement en matiere de procedures de deboursement, comptabilite et
passation des marches; ceci a entrame d'une part des retards considerables dans la mise en
oeuvre du projet et, d'autre part, que des contrats soient passes pour des biens et/ou
services inadaptes (surtout en matiere d'assistance technique);
Du fait plutot des agents d'execution:
-     une  assistance  technique  souvent inadaptee, en  termes de
competence technique et/ou langue (avec de notables exceptions);
Du fait, plutot. de la Banque mondiale et de la cooperation
hollandaise:
-     une mesestimation des realites du pays, un manque d'ecoute et un
manque de flexibilite et d'adaptabilite a la fois pour concevoir et pour changer l'instrument
(le projet), lors de sa definition et au long de sa mise en oeuvre, malgre des efforts certains
pour cela, notamment lors de la revue a mi-parcours;
-     un retard, de la part de la cooperation hollandaise, a debourser la
derniere tranche du don;
En guise de conclusion sur la performance de l'emprunteur et de la
Banque mondiale, nous dirions qu'elle pourrait 8tre qualifiee de deficiente, des deux c8tes.
Quant au jugement concernant le resultat ultime du projet, nous
nous trouvons devant un probleme de fond qui pourrait 8tre exprime ainsi: si les decisions
qui s'imposent sont prises sans dMlai et si, en consequence, les acquis du projet en matiere
d'etudes et strategies peuvent entrer en application, alors, on pourrait juger le resultat
satisfaisant. Faute de ces decisions - et donc jusqu'a nouvel ordre - nous jugeons le
resultat ultime du projet insatisfaisant.
En consequence, avant de pouvoir terminer le rapport
d'achevement du projet et avant de lancer la preparation d'une autre operation, il nous
semble important de poursuivre le dialogue, notamment dans le sens d'obtenir une reponse
a la question posee dans le paragraphe precedent. Dans la mesure oil, nous en avons
conscience, cette reponse n'est pas simple et qu'elle pourrait meme exiger, en fait, la
preparation d'un calendrier d'etapes et/ou d'un document concernant la phase
operationnelle du projet (une fois les investissements realises), nous somnmes prets a
organiser une mission au mois de mai prochain afin d'en discuter. Nous en profiterions
pour faire, avec vous et tous les autres bailleurs de fonds concemrs, une reconnaissance

Republic of Guinea-Bissau
World Bank Mission
Finalization of the Implementation Completion report for the Agricultural Services Project
(PASA -- IDA Credit 1 799-GUB -- Grant from the Netherlands Government No. 2457-GUB)
Discussions on the future of Bank assistance to the agriculture sector development
(Mav 8-17, 1995)
Aide-memoire
1.    Mrs. Catherine Cassagne, the new World Bank operations officer for agriculture and the
environment in Guinea-Bissau, visited the country from May 8 to 17, 1995. The mission worked with the
pertinent government authorities to complete the implementation completion report (ICR) for PASA and to
map out -- in conjunction with donors and the cooperation agencies in question -- the possibilities of future
World Bank assistance to agriculture in Guinea-Bissau.  Officials representing the Netherlands
Government, as a cofinancier of PASA, and the SNV in Bissau worked with the mission, although they
could not accompany it throughout. The GAPLA Credit and Savings Officer, Mr. Amadu Dab6,
participated in the mission virtually all of the time and provided support to it. The mission would like to
thank the individuals and entities it met with for their time and attention.
2.    The mission took place after a series of events:
(a)   the PASA implementation completion mission led by Mr. Cheikh Sow, from February 1-8, 1995,
which discussed a draft ICR. The MDRA prepared an evaluation from the Borrower's perspective,
includinL, an executive summary, which will be an annex of the ICR;
(b)   the letter of April 17, 1995 from the World Bank to the Minister of Rural Development and
Agriculture,' with a copy to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Fisheries, formally approving --
and annexing -- the aide-m6moire from that mission, summarizing the ICR and announcing the present
mission;2
(c)   the letter of April 24 to the same Minister, cosigned by various donors and cooperation agencies
(including the World Bank), to which IFAD subsequently subscribed, via letter of May 10 to the Minister.
3.     As stated in the April 17 letter, the mission reiterated to the Minister of Rural Development and
Agriculture and to the other parties the World Bank's concern as to the real sustainability of the
investments made under PASA, i.e. the impact of the project, beyond the existence of a plethora of studies,
training sessions, research activities and other operations financed under PASA. The first draft of the ICR
and the report by the Borrower do not sufficiently reflect this concern; nor do they propose any solution to
the problem. Nevertheless, that letter and the present mission specifically asked the authorities -- primarily
the Minister of Rural Development and Agriculture -- about the fact that the results of PASA had not been
followed up by the necessary decisionmaking that would have enabled PASA to have a positive impact on
the agriculture sector. As particularly illustrative examples of this situation the mission cited the non-
1     Sent by fax to the management unit of the economic management project.
2      The World Bank has not received an answer to this letter.

approval of the MDRA's human resource management policy, formulated with PASA support, as well as
the relative isolation of GAPLA and its under-utilization, as the World Bank considered both these issues to
be key to PASA's achievements.
4.     GAPLA personnel commented that, in certain aspects, the major problem wvas a funding shortfall
that was making the financing of operating costs difficult, which meant that systematic implementation of
the studies and/or recommendations could not proceed as planned. The mission recognized that such a
problem was in fact apparent, but it considers that the country does have financial resources, including
some generated by the agriculture sector itself.  Decisions would have to be made regarding their
mobilization. The mission further indicated to the Minister and GAPLA personnel -- and had the
impression that they themselves concur with the idea -- that if a number of priorities could be identified
(through the formulation of the agricultural policy and the PIP derived therefrom, which could be limited to
a total amount compatible with the real investment and management capacity), the derived operating
expenditures could also be estimated more accurately. The Minister and the two MDRA directors general
told the mission that the top priority of the MDRA was rice production.
5.    The mission told the government authorities that the Bank's concern with PASA's impact seems to
be shared by a number of other donors, who are disappointed with the negligible impact of the large
projects.3 Along with the MDRA, they too would all like to find a durable way of supporting sector
development. Hence the joint letter of April 24, referred to in 2(c) above. As part of its mandate, the
present mission was to seek the reaction of the Government to the letter, in conjunction with the other
donors.
6.     Before the ICR is finalized, and precisely because the issue of project sustainability and impact is
still open, depending on the decisions taken by the Government, the April 17 letter proposed to the Minister
that the MDRA commit itself through a brief "plan for the future operation of the project" (in fact
mentioned, but not detailed, in the Borrower's own report). The mission explained to GAPLA staff that the
plan4 would have to detail the phases, official/legal decisions and other necessary actions that would be part
of a reasonable timetable to which the Borrower would commit in order to maximize the sustainability of
PASA results. The mission reiterated that while in fact the formulation of such a plan was not an
obligation of the Borrower under the terms of the credit agreement, it was being requested now as a step in
determining the form that future assistance would take.
7.    In a meeting with the mission on May 12, the Minister of Rural Development and Agriculture did
not indicate whether the Government was going to take the decisions referred to in para. (3) above in the
3      PASA, however, was unlike so-called "large projects," which primarily aimed to increase
production and were mostly field-based operations. It is the opinion of those with whom the mission
spoke that PASA could even have assisted in refocusing certain of such "large projects." The mission
feels that, even if for different reasons, there is a fundamental problem with the poor sustainability of
most projects in the agriculture sector, including PASA.
4      The formulation of a plan for the operational phase of the project (which follows the
implementation phase), setting forth the program and means for "operationalizing" the investments
made during implementation, is now a clause included in most World Bank credit agreements. Such a
plan must be prepared before implementation completion report, and must be mentioned in it.

near future. Nevertheless, the ICR must be finalized and this uncertainty taken into account. Basically, the
ICR will remain as it does at present, as discussed with GAPLA staff members, but reflecting only some of
the findings of the mission during its interviews and field visits. The Borrower's executive summary was
amended by GAPLA staff and submitted to the mission before its departure. The new executive summary
will be annexed to the ICR without any changes.
8.     The Minister, however gave assurances that both the donors and the MDRA shared the same
concems, and that the formulation of an "agriculture policy statement" -- and a medium-term PIP derived
therefrom for the sector -- to be prepared by the MDRA itself, in consultation with the other ministries and
the beneficiaries, was regarded as an extremely important issue that had already been discussed with the
other ministers. He further indicated that, before the donors are approached, it is important to create viable
institutional conditions and that, in any event, only small-scale projects could be sustainable under the
present circumstances. He mentioned that institutional reform was under way and that there were major
challenges to be tackled in agricultural planning, which would take time. He mentioned the difficulty of
political decisionmaking, the inexperienced private sector, the problem of limited incentives for public
employees and the challenge of mobilizing national resources, for example, via utilization of the Forestry
Fund and other special funds. In this regard, he said that the special funds would henceforth be overseen
by the Ministry of Finance.
9.     Both the Minister and the GAPLA Director gave assurances that the MDRA had already begun the
policy formulation process, and had consulted the beneficiaries and decentralized parties in the sector,
supported by FAO (regional master plans). The final results would be ready in January 1996, although
preliminary findings would be presented in June 1995. He also said that during the next rainy season
(when no work in the interior can be done) consultations could take place with the parties concemed in
Bissau, along with policy formulation and standardization with the other ministries (e.g. Finance, Trade)
and that a first draft of the policy based on the studies already completed could be formulated in the coming
months.'
10.    The mission asked the MDRA to prepare a brief activities program with a timetable for the various
steps in the formulation of the policy and the PIP, which could be submitted to the donors when they all met
at the MDRA, at the invitation of the Minister, within a few weeks to a month (timing indicated by the
Minister). The mission requested that the members of the next Bank mission (Messrs. Fredriksen and
Andrade, AF5CO, macroeconomic issues) also be invited to the meeting. Only after that meeting and the
submission of the activities program by the MDRA, and depending on its results, can a follow-up mission
be scheduled to map out possible future assistance.
11.    The mission reiterated the Bank's intention to continue the dialogue and assistance to the
agriculture sector. However, it said that this could be done only in conjunction with the other donors and in
application of the above-mentioned agriculture policy statement -- and the resulting medium-term public
5      GAPLA staff also recalled that after the conference of MDRA technical specialists in 1993 a
commission had been set up within the MDRA. It was headed by the GAPLA and made responsible
for the work involved in agricultural policy formulation. Subsequently, task forces were established to
study credit, training, extension and reorganization of the MDRA and produced reports containing
recommendations. It is the opinion of the mission that this is undoubtedly a positive effort, but thus
far it has not had any real impact, and now needs to get off the drawing board.

investment program for the sector, which had to mesh with and address the desires of farmers, the primary
beneficiaries. It also indicated that a future operation might not take the conventional structure of an
isolated "project," but would provide support to the regular structure of the MDRA in implementing its
PIP, which should consist not of unrelated projects but of regular budget lines for the previously identified
priorities. As such, the operation, which could be assisted by various coordinated donors, would be more
of an overall credit to the sector, with clearcut modalities and rules for utilization. The Minister and
GAPLA seemed very interested in the idea, in principle, and eager to learn more about the possible
practical modalities of such a new instrument. The mission indicated that the Bank could finance a trip to
countries that had already opted for such operations, or from one of those countries to Guinea-Bissau, to
learn more about the new instrument. The mission also said that it would speak with the other donors to
stimulate their interest (some already are interested) so that joint efforts in this direction could begin.
12.    As explained to the GAPLA Director, the mission reiterated that the World Bank would not require
the PASA "operation plan" referred to in para. 6 above, if the MDRA agrees to formulate the above-
mentioned policy and medium-term PIP.
13.    The mission also had a long discussion with the Minister of Fisheries and visited that Ministry's
data processing center, since investments in the subsector had been made under PASA. Despite the
problems that also affected this component during project implementation and the fact that its efficiency
(cost-benefit) could have been greater, it is clear that PASA investments in the subsector had a real and
lasting impact, primarily in data collection and processing. The pertinent details will be given in the ICR.
The Fisheries Minister also explained to the mission the goals towards which subsector institutions were
working and gave it a copy of the 1995 activities program for the subsector that had been derived from the
Government's medium-term  program. The Minister also asked the mission to transmit his request to
Washington regarding the World Bank's consideration of possible support for investment in artisanal
fishing, as an integral part of the agriculture sector. In the discussion on the matter, it could be defined that
there was a serious problem with the lack of credit for groups of artisanal fisherman, who are also small
farmers.
14.    The mission also visited ANAG and had a long discussion with the vice president, Antonio Nunes.
PASA investments in this area also had a very useful impact, which will be mentioned in the ICR.
Moreover, the mission was genuinely impressed with the dynamism demonstrated by ANAG, whose
operations are funded by member dues.
15.    Pending and other matters: The Minister of Rural Development and Agriculture assured the
mission that the completion of the MDRA's new building (another PASA investment) was a matter of
ongoing concem and a great challenge that it planned to overcome. He asked if the World Bank intended to
help. The mission responded that the justification for such support would have to be reassessed, as part of
a future operation's appraisal (which, once again, depends inter alia on the formulation of the agriculture
policy and the medium-term PIP derived from it), but that it could not give a definitive answer as to the
outcome of such reassessment. Lastly, the Minister also said that the MDRA would continue to search for
the funds needed to pay for the last two PASA audit reports (for 1993 and up to September 30, 1994). The
mission recalled that the Borrower was responsible for having the audits performed by an independent firm
and that non-performance of this obligation could constitute an obstacle to the approval of new projects in
the sector.

ICR - Imvlementation Comnletion Report
A- INTRODUCAO
1.     Tendo por base os procedimentos estabelecidos pelo Banco Mundial, devera ser elaborado um ICR -
Relat6rio Final de Implementacao de qualquer projecto financiado por essa instituicao multilateral, no momento
em que se termina. No caso presente do PASA - Projecto de Apoio ao Sector Agricola, e ap6s tres prorrogac6es
verificadas em finais de 1991, de 1992 e de 1993, o encerramento oficial das suas actividades verificar-se-a a 30 de
Setembro 1994.
2.     A Metodologia seguida para a elaboracao foi a seguinte:
-      basear a infornacao nas realizacoes materiais e organizativas (outputs) do projecto atraves da listagem dos
pagamentos (applications-pedidos de desembolso) efectuados e da discussao com os sectores/componentes
beneficiarios das actividades do PASA.
3.     0 ICR solicitado pelo Banco Mundial pretende que se abordem os seguintes aspectos:
- alcance dos objectivos do projecto;
- sustentabilidade do projecto;
- performance das prestac6es do Banco e do Governo GB/MDRA;
- performance global do projecto;
- plano para a operacao futura do projecto/impacto.
Tendo presentes esses t6picos, a estrutura do relat6rio que se passa imediatamente a apresentar assentara numa
linha de analise com primazia para o particular, com uma forte componente interpretativa nao apenas baseada nos
indicadores fisico-materiais alcancados, mas tambem (e fundamentalmente) no impacto verificado no sector
beneficiario.
B- OBJECTIVOS GLOBAIS ALCANVADOS PELO PASA - INDICADORES DE REALIZACAO
4.     0 obiectivo principal a alcancar pelo projecto, no periodo inicialmente previsto (3 anos), foi a criacao
duma capacidade basica no MDRP (na altura) que Ihe permitisse:
-      gerir os recursos humanos do sector, particularmente a assistencia tecnica;
-      o planeamento das suas actividades e da coordenacao da ajuda externa;
-      melhorar o seu papel tdcnico nalguns subsectores (hidraulica agricola, florestas, fruticultura, pecuaria e
pescas);
-      assegurar o acompanhamento e implementacao das medidas de ajustamento estrutural no sector agrario
(especialmente no dominio do investimento publico/PIP).
5.     Para tal, o MDRP deveria, em primeiro lugar, ser apoiado na criagao duma divisao de Recursos Humanos
no seio do GAPLA, para nao s6 gerir a assistencia tecnica (extema) como tambdm implementar medidas
conducentes a uma melhor utilizacao e gestao do pessoal local.

6.     0 montante total previsto foi de 7.0 milhoes de USD em moeda externa, cerca de 800 mil USD em moeda
nacional (co-participacao governanental da GB), devendo ser distribuidos da seguinte forma:
- Moeda externa:      8.4 % construc6es civis (7.0 milh6es USD)
15.0 % veiculos/equipamentos
40.0 % assist. tec./formacao/estudos
19.3 % bens e servicos
3.3 % despesas operacionais
14.0 % PPF e imprevistos
- Moeda nacional:     25 % construc6es civis (equiv. 800 mil USD)
75 % despesas operacionais
O escalonamento anual de desembolsos deveria ser 43 % no ano 1, 35,5 no ano 2 e 21,5 no ano 3. Em termos de
escalonamento anual dos desembolsos efectuados, a imagem e a seguinte:
- ano 88:       3 % do total
- ano 89:      18 % do total
- ano 90:      32 % do total
- ano 91:      25 % do total
- ano 92:      12 % do total
- ano 93:       3 % do total
- ano 94:       7 % do total
Estes indicadores sao de dificil comparacao com o previsto (3 anos), dado que o PASA foi prorrogado tres
vezes (em finais de 91,92 e 93). No entanto, se compararmos os anos de realizacao 88 e 89 com o ano 1 previsto e
os anos de realizacao 92 ate 94 com o ano 3 previsto, conclui-se que houve uma sobreestimacAo da capacidade
de investimento nos primeiros anos do projecto, pois apenas se conseguiu realizar metade do investimento
previsto no ano 1 do projecto (88 e 89), enquanto que no ano 2 (90 e 91) aumentou bastante o nivel de investimento
real. Esta imagem e prova evidente (tambem em outros projectos) que o "arranque" dos projectos publicos na
GB e a fase mais dificil e aquela que tem apresentado maiores dificuldades comparativamente aos niveis
programados.
Vejamos os indicadores:
Anos reafizacao                 Ano previsto                  Desvio (+ ou -)
88 + 89:21 %                     1:43 %                        - 22 %
90 + 91: 57 %                    2: 35,5 %                    + 21,5 %
92+93:22%                        3:21,5%                       +0,5%
7.     Relativamente as componentes, apresenta-se a seguir um quadro comparativo dos pesos percentuais
programados e de facto realizados/desembolsados, assim como o desvio registado:
Componente             % total/previsto       % total/real           Desvio (+ ou -)
GAPLA                         39,7 %                  45 %                 + 5,3
Agricultura:                   9,8 %                  21%                 + 11,2
DEPA/Frut.                    0,8 %                   9 %                 + 8,2
DHAS/Hidraul.                 9,0 %                  12 %                 + 3,0
Pecuaria/Prod.Anim             6,0 %                   6 %                   0,0
Florestas:                    16,0 %                  11 %                 - 5,0
MDRA/Geral                     9,0 %                   7 %                 - 2,0
Pescas                        19,5 %                   9 %                -10,5

Daqui se concluiu, de imediato, que na sua grande maioria a distribuicao real do investimento foi bastante
diferente do programado, fundamentalmente por tres grandes motivos:
(i)    pouco detalhe na fase da programacao, aspecto que nos parece ter sido relativamente intencional, dada a
especificidade do sector agrfirio e a previsao de mudancas de politica nos anos seguintes a data da
programagao e o arranque do projecto (86/87 em adiante);
(ii)    enfase dada a gestao por objectivo a partir da intensa reorientacao dada ao PASA ap6s meados de 1991, o
que traduz no "fecho" dalgumas componentes (hidraulica, florestas e fruticultura), na "abertura" de novas
frentes de trabalho (ponteiros, palmar, investigacao agricola) e no reforco/intensificacao dalgumas
componentes (GAPLA/formacao, apoio ao MDRA em geral);
(iii)    a pr6pria caracteristica do projecto PASA - apoio institucional global ao MDRA, o que, a partida,
pressupunha (no contexto da Guine-Bissau) alteracoes estruturais e uma certa instabilidade organizativa
transitoria.
8.     A estrutura do investimento e tambem apresentada num grande quadro comparativo, sendo neste caso de
maior dificuldade uma anAlise comparativa directa, dada as diferentes classificag6es das despesas de investimento
nos dois momentos. De qualquer modo, e por aglutinacao de despesas afins, a imagem e a seguinte:
PRESTADOR SERVICO                   QUANTIDADE                     % DO TOTAL
Tecnicos Nacionais/total:                    686 h. mes                     8,0
AT permanente                                94
Consultorias                                 71
FormaSao/Per diem                           521
Tecnicos indiv. estrang./total:              104 h. mes                     9,0
AT permanente                                 87
Consultorias                                  13
Formacao especifica                            4
Empresas da GB-Total:                         40                           19,0
Empresas Estrangeiras- Total                  50                           59,0
Europa                                       40
Africa                                        5
USA/Brasil                                    5
Outros/diversos (GB)                           -                            5,0
Duma primeira analise ressalta que uma das intenq6cs dos projectos financiados pelo Banco
Mundial/IDA, que e a de estimular/incentivar o mercado local, foi alcan,ada, na medida em que cerca de 1/3
do valor total de servicos fornecidos ao PASA tiveram origem no mercado interno (8 % de tdcnicos + 24 % de
empresas ou pequenos fornecedores), sem se considerar ainda a construqAo do novo edificio do MDRA que foi
adjudicada a um cons6rcio local e sera realizada durante 1994 (o que elevaria o 1/3 para cerca de 40 % do total
do PASA, indicador bastante significativo). E necessario atender ao pouco desenvolvido nivel do mercado
guineense, o que ainda obrigou a que 2/3 dos servicos fossem de proveniencia externa (9 % de tecnicos individuais
e 59 % de empresas de venda de servicos de AT e de equipamentos e materiais).

9.     Tendo presentes os objectivos principais tra,ados para o projecto PASA, e referidos suscintamente no
ponto 4 deste capitulo B do relat6rio, tentamos uma apreciagao geral do seu grau de alcance:
a)     Houve de facto uma melhoria na gestao dos recursos humanos a partir do trabalho produzido com o
investimento do PASA, tendo por base os segtuintes aspectos:
*  foi criada a Divisao de Recursos Humanos no GAPLA, Departamento ate entao inexistente no
MDRA.
*  foi realizado o inventArio/cadastro detalhado do pessoal do MDRA.
*  o GAPLA, com base no projecto PASA, tem sido a entidade do MDRA que mais esforSos realizou
na promoao e integraoao da assistencia tecnica nacional, tendo havido no quadro do PASA/PIR 12
tecnicos nacionais contratados nesses moldos a partir de 1991;
*  com o trabalho de revisao e melhor gestao do PIP agrario realizado no quadro do PASA, conseguiu-
se racionalizar bastante a assistencia tecnica externa no MDRA (mais de 80 tecnicos em 1988
para os actuais 36 tecnicos);
b)     A funeao de planeamento e o inicio duma melhor coordena;1o da ajuda externa, aspectos muito
ligados entre si dado o peso desta iltima no apoio ao investimento puiblico na GB, foram amplamente reforcados
no quadro do PASA, podendo nesmo afirmar-se que foi esta uma das principais contribuic6es/outputs do
projecto para o MDRA. Esta constata,co fundamenta-se na realizac,o do seguinte:
*  refor,o do papel do GAPLA, passando a constituir una das principais Direcc,es-Gerais do MDRA,
e criagao no seu seio duma equipa minima de t6cnicos nacionais com capacidades melhoradas na
identificacao, seguimento e avalia,ao de projectos e outros aspectos de politica agrara;
*  realiza,io duma serie de estudoslreflex6es fundamentais para o processo de formulaVao e gestio
duma politica sectorial agriria;
*  realiza;ao de ac,ces de formaSao na GB (4 cursos de 6 semanas/cada) sobre o planeamento e a
gestao;
*  apesar da assistencia tecnica da DGFC ter sido de reconhecida utilidade pritica, nio parece ter
havido um aproveitamento integral dos seus inputs por raz6es relacionadas com a organizaOao da
DGFC e os seus metodos de gestao;
*  se, por um lado, as duas acq6es-piloto de implementaSao de pequenos regadios no leste da GB
falharam, tambem e certo que se criou no seio do DEAS uma capacidade tecnica nacional de
elaborac,o e seguimento de pequenas obras de engenharia hidrAulica/regadio para o leste do
pais;
C- GRAU DE REALIZA(CAO POR COMPONENTES DO PASA
10.    Se no capitulo B deste relat6rio foi dada uma ideia das realizac,es globais do PASA sob diferentes 6pticas
(por anos, por componentes, por tipo de servi,os prestados, por tipos de investimentos), mas sempre numa
perspectiva global e comparativamente As metas/planeamento definidos pelo projecto, aqui iremos concentrar a



- 5 -
nossa analise na quantifica,ao das ac,ces materiais e organizativas realmente empreendidas. A descri,co
sera feita pelas componentes principais do PASA, ou melhor pelos subprojectos que desenvolveu, que foram os
seguintes:
a)     Apoio global ao MDRA (GAPLA, Recursos Humanos/Formac,o, Estatisticas, Infraestruturas/Obras,
Equipamento e apoio ao funcionamento, etc.);
b)     Producao animal (estudos e accao-piloto);
c)     Florestas (legislaco/regulamentos/taxacao, inventarios parciais, viveiro/pesquisa, accao-piloto);
d)     Irrigacao agricola (levantamentos/estudos de pontos de regadio nos vales do leste da GB; 2 projectos-
piloto de "pequenos vales");
e)     Fruticultura (apoio ao Centro de Quebo) e pesquisa agricola aplicada;
f)     Pescas (sistema de recolha e tratamento estatistico sobre a ZEE, formacao).
a)     Apoio alobal ao MDRA:
11.    Neste grupo incluem-se os sub-projectos de: (i) apoio A criaco duma divisao de recursos humanos no
GAPLA; (ii) programas de formacao; (iii) apoio ao planeamento agrArio em geral; (iv) apoio A estatistica agricola;
(v) cria,co de infraestruturas fisicas/construc,es e apoio material ao MDRA.
No tocante ao dominio explicito em (i), realizou-se o seguinte:
-      foi criada a Divisao de Recursos Humanos do GAPLA;
-      equipou-se a Divisao de Recursos Humanos com mobiliario, equipamentos de escrit6rio, material
informaitico;
-      realizou-se de 91 a 94 o inventario/cadastro do pessoal do MDRA, assim como a cria,ico dum software
proprio para a gestao e processamento salarial por meios informaticos;
-      Elaboraram-se diversas normas sobre a admissao do pessoal, carreiras e perfis profissionais, e outras;
12.    No referente ao focado em (ii), a DRH serviu de pivot para o desenvolvimento duma serie de ac,6es de
forma,ao de diversa indole, apesar de ter sido ao gestor do PASA (Director + Assessor Tecnico) que coube a
tarefa de identificar e conceber as Areas de formacao, de modo a caberem/integrarem-se nos objectivos do PASA.
13.    No tocante ao focado no item (iii), as acc6es de apoio ao planeamento agrario no global constituiram
uma das areas centrais de actuacao deste projecto.
-      Fornecida AT extema na ordem dos 99 h.mes, assim como 36 h.mes de AT/local; na realizacao dos
estudos, foram garantidos 11 h.mes/consultorias extemas e 27 h.mes/consultorias nacionais;
-      Fomecidos diversos equipamentos e mobiliarios de escrit6rio e informaticos, feitas reparac,es e pequenas
construcoes no actual edificio central do MDRA/GAPLA, equipado o GAPLA com veiculos diversos (4
ligeiros, 5 Jeeps);
-      Realizado um trabalho de analise/concepcAo que levou A elabora,ao do documento de base "estrategia
do sector agricola" - versao preliminar. (Maio/90);
-      Realizada duas revisoes-avalia,coes da situa,ao do PIP agrario;



- 6 -
-      Realizado um estudo-accao inovador no MDRA intitulado "vias para a modermizacao da agricultura na
GB" - ponteiros (Out/92), assim como uma sdrie de tres col6quios sobre temas de interesse (marketing
agricola, agro-industrializa,co e credito/gestAo agro-economica nas pontas), a par do apoio de tres
viagens/miss6es comerciais de ponteiros a Portugal, Brasil e Cabo-Verde;
-      Reorganizada a estrutura e distribuicao de tarefas a nivel do GAPLA, incentivando uma maior
racionalizacao institucional, o surgimento de novos quadros (pelo menos 4 tecnicos superiores), o
melhoramento do PIP mediante a introducao e formacao num novo metodo de preparagao e de seguimento
do mesmo;
-      Elaborado um projecto da nova lei organica do MDRA, que constitui a base de discussio com o
Ministerio da Funcao Pubfica;
-      Criada e posta em funcionamento uma Celula de Contabilidade no GAPLA;
-      Apoiada a redac,ao/publicacao dum despacho normativo conjunto sobre as concess6es fundiarias, bem
como a elaboracao dos criterios agro-econ6micos para a avaliacao dos pedidos de concessao de terras;
Pode-se afirmar que foi nestes dominios que maior impacto terao tido as actividades exercidas pelo PASA, em
particular ap6s a reorientacao dada ao projecto em meados de 91 e ap6s a afecta,co dum Assessor Tecnico
Principal junto ao Director do GAPLA (e do PASA).
14.    Nos dominios referidos em (iv), estrategias agricolas, tambem inseridas no GAPLA, destacam-se as
seguintes realizacoes:
-      Equipada a Divisao de Estatisticas do GAPLA, com algum mobiliario, equipamento de escritorio e
material informatico;
-      Elaborados/publicados tres trabalhos especificos (revisao do censo 88/89 em 1992; primeiro censo dos
ponteiros; primeiro censo fruticola - caju e manga);
-      Dado apoio concreto a realizacao do censo agricola feito em 88/89, bem como a inuimeras acc6es
pontuais de recolha e tratamento estatistico;
15.    No referente aos aspectos focados como item (v) - apoio geral ao MDRA, incluem-se aqui as seguintes
realiza,6es:
-      Varias repara,ces/obras para melhoria das instalacoes centrais do MDRA(Gabinete do Ministro, Sala
de reuni6es do MDRA, DGA, DGFC, etc.);
-      Fornecimento de diversos equipamentos e mobiliario de escrit6rio, pagamento de inuimeras despesas de
funcionamento;
-      Feito o projecto de engenharia e arquitectura do novo edificio do MDRA (por uma firma local -
PROJECTAE) e realizado o concurso para adjudicacao da referida obra (Abril a Junho/93);
-      Co-financiamento das accoes de formacao assinadas entre o MDRA e o Ministerio da Agricultura de
Portugal;
-      Apoio ao Centro de Documentacao Agraria do MDRA com alguma formacao e pequenos meios
materiais, assim como a Celula Nacional de Vulgarizacao Agraria (seminario no estrangeiro do Responsavel,
mobiliario e equipamentos de escrit6rio).



-7-
b)     Producao Animal:
16.    Estas acc6es foram centradas e geridas directamente pela Direcc,o-Geral da Pecuaria, tendo
compreendido directamente o seguinte:
-      Realiza,es de dois estudos pelo GAPTEC denominados "sistemas tradicionais de producao animal na
GB" e "situacao s6cio-econ6mica da sanidade animal na GB" entre os meados de 90 e meados de 94;
-      Paralelamente aos trabalhos ligados aos estudos atras referidos, foi feito o seguimento da situa,ao
pecuaria em 120 tabancas (numa primeira fase/90 e 91) e de 40 tabancas (numa segunda fase/92-94)
nas regioes de Bafata, Gabu e Oio/Bissora;
-      Feitas diversas acc6es de formacao tecnica a equipa nacional do subprojecto (Director-Geral,
VeterinArios, Zootecnicos), mediante deslocac6es ao estrangeiro (Portugal, essencialmente), e com
realizac,o de seminarios tecnicos em Bissau;
-      Fornecidos varios equipamentos e material de escritorio a DGP;
-      Preparado um projecto-piloto para apresentacao ao financiamento pelo PlRlPrograma de Incentivos
Rurais (fundo FIDA) decorrente dos estudos realizados;
c)     Florestas:
17.    As accoes neste sector tem duas fases bem marcadas: - a primeira, que decorre no inicio do PASA ate
meados de 91, muito virada para o apoio global DGFC; - a segunda fase, de meados de 91 ate Setembro de 94,
centrada numa accao-piloto de renovacao do palmar na zona norte do pais, decorrente duma identificacao feita
na fase anterior. Em sintese, as realizac6es descrevem-se a seguir:
-      Elaborada uma proposta de projecto de lei florestal, que viria mais tarde (92) a ser publicada no Boletim
Oficial,
-      Elaborada uma proposta sobre a organica e regulamento interno da DGFC., que se vem tentando
aplicar;
-      Definido um programa que serviu de suporte a proposta apresentada pela DGFC sobre accoes a
desencadear no dominio ambiental;
-      Realizado o inventario florestal de duas importantes concessoes de empresas madeireiras (Maudo San6
e FOLBI);
-      Efectuado o estudo que permitiu encontrar as bases tecnicas e econ6micas sobre a taxacao florestal;
-      Prestada assistencia tecnica entre 89 e 90 atraves de dois peritos (um engenheiro florestal/18 h.m e um
engenheiro florestal para a experimentac,o/viveiros florestal / h.Km);
-      Feitos investimentos nos viveiros de Embunhe e de Canchungo (Paimar);
-      Adquiridos variadissimos equipamentos e materiais especificos para as florestas e fauna;
-      Importadas 60 mil sementes pre-germinadas de palmeira de azeite (Hibrido Tenera), postas em viveiro
durante 18 meses, tendo sido distribuidas cerca de 55 mil plantas durante a epoca das chuvas de 93;



- 8 -
-      Realizadas poucas ac,es de forma,co em Bissau (guardas florestais e palmar), e varias no exterior do
pais (Portugal, Costa de Marfim, Cabo Verde, Gambia, etc.).
18.    As ac,6es nao tiveram impacto no dominio da produ,co de plantas em viveiros e consequentemente na
accao de reflorestamento (salvo no palmar), assim como numa maior preparacao dos quadros medios e de base
(guardas florestais), logo duma maior capacidade de intervenc,o da DGFC, por questoes essencialmente do foro
institucional e organizacional do aparelho piTblico que preside ao sector, aspecto evidenciado na avalia,co feita ao
PASA em meados de 91.
d)     Irriiacio azricola:
19.    As ac,6es realizadas neste ambito centraram-se em duas vertentes: - apoio ao DHAS - Departamento de
Hidraulica Agricola e Solos da DGA na capacita,ao para formar e gerir projectos de aproveitamento hidroagricola
e pequenos vales no leste; - iniciar uma ac,ao-piloto a nivel do leste de constru,ao desses mesmos esquemas
hidro-agricolas, a nivel de camponeses de duas tabancas da regiao de Gabu.
Concretamente realizou-se o seguinte:
Foi prestada assistencia tecnica pela empresa Holandesa EUROCONSULT atraves de presenwa
durante 30 homens/mes dum especialista em engenharia hidroagricola, que levou a criacao duma
unidade de projectos e seguimento de projectos do tipo atras indicados (com pelo menos tres tecnicos
capacitados para o efeito);
-      Elaborados os APS - ante-projectos sumarios de engenharia referentes a pontos de regadio com potencial
e vantagens na sua elaboracao, identificados no leste do pais;
-      Fornecidos diversos equipamentos e materiais tecnicos (fotografias por satelite e aereas. de desenho,
topograficos, hidraulicos, de pedologia, geradores, etc.);
-      Realizada alguma forma,io "on-the-job training" e virias acV6es de forma,ao no exterior (Portugal,
Japao, Burkina Faso);
-      Iniciadas duas ac,es-piloto em duas tabancas da regiao de Bafata de construcao de pequenos
esquemas hidroagricolas de aproveitamento de pequenos vales:
-      Garantido o financiamento de diversas despesas de funcionamento do DHAS.
e)     Fruticultura e pesquisa a2ricola aplicada:
20.    Inicialmente esta componente nio foi muito detalhada, estando apenas definido que investimentos iriam
ser feitos no Centro Fruticola de Quebo, a par doutros fundos baseados num projecto financiado por Portugal
relativo ao mesmo centro. Com o decorrer do tempo foram sendo encontradas e apoiadas outras iniciativas no
dominio da fruticultura, e a partir da avalia,co feita em meados de 91, alargou-se a intervencao para o dominio da
pesquisa agricola aplicada (tecnicas culturais e culturas de planalto). As acc,es realizadas foram:
-      Aplicados varios investimentos materiais no Centro Fruticola de Quebo;
-      Feitos varios investimentos materiais no Centro de Contuboel ligados aos sub-programas de tecnicas
culturais e cultura de planalto;



- 9 -
Financiada a formacIo no Brasil/lPA durante tres anos (91, 92, 93 e 94) de tres tecnicos medios do
DEPA no dominio da fruticultura;
-      Importado e plantado (com  grandes quebras de vingamento) em  Quebo um  grande numero de
Vitroplantas;
-      Realizado um estudo de pormenor sobre a reorientacao da pesquisa agraria na GB mediante o
recrutamento de 3 consultores externos (3 h. mes) em 1989;
-      Elaborados dois manuais sobre citrinos (3.000 mil exemplares) e apicultura (vArias centenas);
-      Obtidos alguns resultados decorrentes dos ensaios realizados em Contuboel nas campanhas agricolas
91/92 e 92/93 sobre tecnicas culturais de alguns cultivos, como o milho bacil (Zea mays), milho cabalo
(sorgo), mandioca, feij3o.
21.    Face ao volume e esforco feito neste dominio, particularmente no Centro de Quebo, a par do outro co-
financianiento ai aplicado (Portugal), seria de esperar que ja se tivessem alcancado resultados mais concretos,
nomeadamente a producao e venda de plantas fruteiras aos agricultores, o que ainda nao sucede na escala
minimamente desejavel.
No tocante a pesquisa agricola aplicada, cujas ac,6es foram identificadas ap6s a revis3o do PASA em
meados de 91, nao seria possivel em duas campanhas obter respostas tecnicas muito s6lidas, mas importa que o
actual INPA (ex-DEPA) veja como prosseguir com esses dois pequenos programas de interesse reconhecido.
f)     Pescas:
22.    Neste relat6rio n3o iremos entrar em  detalhes na componente do PASA  ligada as pescas, pelo
desconhecimento tecnico-profissional que obviamente temos sobre a materia, dado o facto de sermos especialistas
agrArios. Em sintese, as accoes que sobressaem foram:
-      Montado no Ministdrio das Pescas um centro de recolha, tratamento e divulgacao de informaqgo
estatistica sobre a actividade pesqueira industrial na GB;
-      Financiadas varias acc6es de forma,co no estrangeiro de varios quadros tdcnicos superiores e medios, bem
como algumas accoes em Bissau (observadores, informraticos, etc.), bem como materiais ligadas A
formac3o;
-      Fornecida assistencia tecnica externa entre 89 e 91 na ordem dos 50 h/mes (3 especialistas) e 3 h.mes de
consultorias externas pontuais.
0 PASA foi sem quaisquer duvidas um dos projectos publicos mais realizadores, n3o s6 dada a sua
caracteristica de apoio institucional muito amplo, como tambem por uma grande flexibilidade na gest3o para ir
identificando actividades A medida da sua evolu,co, apesar de que deveria ter sido mais concentrado no referente
aos dominios de intervenc3o. Vejamos os inumeros estudos de base importantes que foram realizados (mais de
uma dezena), a quantidade enorme de aquisicoes materiais feitas (duas dezenas de viaturas, duas dezenas de
computadores, uma dezena de grupos de moto-bombas, quase uma dezena de motores geradores, mais de tres
centenas de bicicletas, mais de uma centena de motorizadas, centenas de milhares de plantas melhoradas, etc.), o
volume e as areas de formacao encetadas (mais de 500 homens/mes, nuimero bastante significativo), a assistencia
tecnica garantida (cerca de 460 homens/mes, sendo 130 homens/mes de proveniencia nacional), o numero de
empresas fornecedoras envolvidas (nove dezenas, sendo 40 nacionais), entre outros aspectos.

Independentemente dos niveis de eficacia alcancados, dos erros certamente cometidos e de outros
problemas, nao se podera negar o volume dos esforcos feitos pelo PASA e o seu impacto nas estruturas
(centrais, em especial) do MDRA, constituindo um dos mais importantes esteios do seu funcionamento entre
88 e 94.
D - PAPEL DO BANCO MUNDIAL/IDA E DO MDRA - ALCANCES E LIMITANTES
23.    Obviamente que os papeis do Banco Mundial - fonte e coordenador da ajuda externa (64 % cr6dito
concessional IDA e 36 % donativo Holanda), e do MDRA - beneficiario das acq6es do projecto e gestor
operacional do mesmo, terao de ser diferentes, e e nessa 6ptica que deverao ser analisados.
Nos dois primeiros anos houve alguma fragilidade na atencao dada na aplicacao rigorosa desse aspecto,
essencialmente por uma certa demora na afectacao das grandes tranches de HFL-Florins holandeses da
Holanda junto do Banco Mundial, o que o levou a que pontualmente se tivesse aplicado o credito IDA em
pagamentos que deveriam ter sido do ambito do donativo da Holanda. Esta situacao melhorou bastante a partir de
final de 91, por a partir dessa data praticamente nao se ter utilizado o credito IDA, estando o saldo existente
praticamente cativo para o pagamento da construcao do novo edificio do MDRA.
24.    Para alem do problema existente com uma certa demora no momento oportuno de "entrada" do donativo
holandes no financiamento ao PASA, outro aspecto de gestao financeiro sucedeu e liga-se com o nao
funcionamento da conta especial do projecto a partir de fins de 91, o que levou a sua pouca utilizacao,
nomeadamente na cobertura das despesas mais operacionais, prejudicando obviamente a funcionabilidade do
PASA.
A razao fundamental reside na incapacidade governamental da GB para contribuir com os fundos em
PG nas despesas operacionais do PASA, o que impossibilitava o reconstitui,co da conta mediante justificativos da
participacao da GB.
25.    A grave quest3o salarial e das condicfes de vida para o pessoal da funcao puiblica na GB vao levar ao
aceleramento do abandono do Estado dos melhores tecnicos, um nuimero bastante significativo deles beneficiarios
de acq6es de formac,o e de transferencia de know-how no quadro do PASA e de outros projectos. A partir de 1991,
conseguiu-se que o Banco Mundial aprovasse o recrutamento de alguns tecnicos nacionais como consultores do
PASA, com niveis salariais estimuladores (situados entre os 600 a 1.300 USD/mes), bem como duma serie de
postos basicos e medios. Foi esta a finica forma de "reter" no MDRA/PASA esses tecnicos, e n3o vislumbramos
outra maneira de solucionar o problema que nAo esta.
Os projectos terao sempre que recrutar/pagar assistencia tecnica local, "triada" por metodos transparentes
(concursos) e promotora de qualidade tecnica, promovendo e selecionando os melhores. Alem disso, as entidades
beneficiirias terao que ser cada vez menos o aparelho puiblico, transferindo essa ajuda para entidades mais
representativas do sector agrario (associac,es, empresas, entidades locais/regioes, ONGs, etc.), e nos casos onde
obrigatoriamente tenha que se apoiar o Estado, fazendo duma forma que autonomize entidades especificas
(organismos para-estatais) e promova os melhores tecnicos.
E - SUSTENTABILIDADE DO PROJECTO - IMPACTO NO FUTURO DAS ACTIVIDADES DO MDRA
26.    Se bem que seja de dificil mensurac3o estimar o impacto de projectos do tipo do PASA, onde a
componente apoio institucional e dominante, logo o estabelecimento de criterios do que sera um bom ou mau
impacto serem muito dependentes do analista e do beneficiario, nao ha duvidas de que, pelo numero e grau de
interveno,ces que o projecto desenvolveu, houve um impacto evidente nas estruturas centrais do MDRA
cobertas.



- I1 -
Sem este projecto nao seria possivel a maioria das suas Direcq6es-Gerais, encabecadas pelo GAPLA,
equiparem-se do ponto de vista material (viaturas, mobiliarios, equipamento de escrit6rio e de informatica, meios
tecnicos, meios para funcionamento corrente), terem aumentado a sua capacidade tecnica (externa e nacional)
prestada, desenvolverem enormemente acces de formacao e assimilacao de know-how pelos quadros nacionais.
Estes aspectos sao fundamentados pela longa e exaustiva listagem de apoios integrados pelo PASA.
0 GAPLA, Direccao-Geral de planeamento Agrario, guanto a n6s entidade mais importante e gue mais
proxima deve estar situado (hierarquicamente) iunta do Ministro do DRA, ainda nao encerra em si todas as fimnces
que Ihe permitam coordenar todos os aspectos agro-econ6micos do MDRA. E o caso dos aspectos ligados ao
orcamento de funcionamento (OGE) estarem ainda muito dependentes da DGA e do DAF, e nao permitirem um
equilibrio com o PIP - Investimento Publico. 0 mesmo sucede no tocante a certos fundos especiais, tais como o
Fundo Florestal, cuja gestao teri que ser alterada e melhorada.
27.    Apesar desses imponderaveis, o impacto do PASA foi positivo em termos de fornecimento dum
variadissimo conjunto de meios, que permitiu ao MDRA funcionar durante a vigencia do mesmo com um minimo
de operacionalidade. Foi tambem positivo pela abertura de novas frentes de trabalho no MDRA, algumas mesmo
ineditas, tais como a ligacao com os ponteiros/agricultores privados, o forte impulso a formaqao de quadros e
algumas areas- piloto (palmar, fruticultura, elaboracao de projectos de regadio, etc.). Dotou o MDRA dalgumas
analises tecnico-econ6micas fundamentais e decisivas para a conduco de acc6es nesses sectores, como foi o caso
da pecuaria, ponteiros, investimento puiblico, reorganizagao da pesquisa agraria, entre outros. Ajudou a criar e
incentivou o papel dalgumas equipas tecnicas baseadas em j6vens profissionais nacionais de futuro, em
particular no GAPLA, Pecuaria, Hidraulica Agricola, Florestas. Pelo seu amplo dominio de intervenc6es, ajudou a
criar uma visio integrada a nivel central do sector agririo, baseada no GAPLA, consubstanciada numa sdrie
de estudos realizados e na formac,o diversa realizada, o que facilitou o contacto e as discuss6es com outros sectores
governamentais (Ministerio das Financas, Piano, Banco Central, etc.), e ao mesmo tempo levou a racionalizacao
dos meios ligados ao investimento piublico (reducao do PIP, do numero de projectos em curso, do volume da
assistencia tecnica, etc.).
28.    Os aspectos imediatamente antes focados s3o alguns dos exemplos que poderao antever alguma
sustentabilidade no futuro imediato das accoes do MDRA. Isto nao invalida que nao existam alguns riscos e
quest6es que o PASA nio conseguiu atacar e ultrapassar, seja porque nao caberia no seu anmbito, seja pelas suas
pr6prias limitagoes.
Repetimos que a questAo institucional no seio do MDRA (e do aparelho publico da GB, em geral), constitui a
principal limitante a melhores resultados/impactos de qualquer projecto. Enquanto nao forem tomadas medidas
de fundo sobre a racionaliza,ao do pessoal, clarificacao (na prAtica)das funcoes das diferentes Direccoes Gerais do
MDRA e maior disciplina e rigor na gestao publica, a situacao gravosa dos actuais nivdis salariais dos tdcnicos do
Estado, levarao inevitavelmente que os melhores irao abandonando o Estado a medida que forem encontrando
situacoes socio-profissionais adequadas no mercado interno de trabalho, enquanto que permanecerao no MDRA os
mais incapazes.
29.    Em suma: o PASA, apesar duma fase inicial (88 a 90) com algum empolamento e exagero na assistencia
tdcnica externa, assim como da inadequacao da qualidade e dos perfis da mesma nalguns sectores (planeamento,
gestao global), conseguiu apos a oportuna avaliacao de medioprazo em Julho de 91 reorientar-se positivamente,
passando a apresentar o seu melhor periodo em termos de performance, que decorre de finais de 91 a meados de
94.
Passou de facto a constituir um dos mais importantes projectos do PIP para o reforco e a melhoria da
capacidade de gestao e planeamento agro-econ6mico do MDRA, assim como nalgumas areas tdcnicas pontuais.
Isso permitiu o surgimento duma sdrie de jovens quadros tdcnicos com perspectivas boas, assim como reforcou
bastante o papel e o nivel de anAlise dos mais antigos, alguns dos quais vieram a assumir novas e importantes
tarefas no aparelho puiblico governamental; paralelamente racionalizou-se a assistencia tdcnica externa, por uma
elevacao da sua capacidade de analise tdcnica e concepgao no dominio do planeamento agro-econ6mico
(assessoria), complementada com vdrias acq6es de formacao, quer no pais, quer no exterior, se bem que tinha
havido uma certa dispersao nos dominios que abarcou.

0 inventArio material feito, assim como o que ainda estA em falta mas jA assegurado (novo edificio do
MDRA), foi correctamente gerido e aplicado, salvo pequenos erros normais neste tipo de situaq6es. 0 processo de
gestao administrativo-contabilistica podera ter sido mais eficiente, mas nunca foi um impedimento A realizaqao das
accoes previstas no PASA, salvo os atrasos decorrentes das quest6es ligadas A conta especial (Banco Central da
GB) e da incapacidade do Governo da GB na co-participacao financeira em moeda nacional.
Findo o Projecto, em Setembro de 94, nao se legam "elefantes brancos", nem se criaram situac6es criticas
e conflituosas. Antes pelo contrario; ha todo um manancial de trabatho tecnico realizado e de elevac,ao do know-
how de vArios quadros tecnicos nacionais, que importa agora que o MDRA saiba continuar a utilizar e rentabilizar
ainda mais, para o que urge uma profunda reforma organica e estrutural no seu seio, para a qual disp6e de varias
propostas, dentre as quais algumas decorrentes deste projecto.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
(ICR)
A.     Introduction
1.     It is a requirement of the World Bank that an ICR (Implementation Completion Report) be prepared for all
Bank-financed projects upon their completion. This is the purpose of the present report and concerns the PASA
(Agricultural Services Support Project) that, following three extensions at the end of 1991, 1992 and 1993, was officially
closed on September 30, 1994.
2.     The methodology adopted for preparation of the document was as follows:
(a) the information was based on the project's material and organizational achievements (outputs), through the
list of payments (disbursement applications) effected and discussion with the PASA beneficiary
sectors/components.
3.     The ICR requested by the World Bank is intended to cover the following aspects:
(a) achievement of project objectives;
(b) project sustainabiity;
(c) performance of the Bank and of the Government through MDRA;
(d) overall project performance; and
(e) plan for future project operation/impact.
Bearing these aspects in mind, the structure of the report will be based on a line of analysis focusing on the
details, with a strong interpretive component, based not only on the project's physical and material achievements but also
(and fundamentally) on the impact on the beneficiary sector.
B.     Global Objectives Achieved by PASA - Indicators of Results
4.     The main obiective to be accomplished by the project within the period initially envisaged (three years) was the
creation of basic caDacities at the then MDRP which would enable it:
(a) to mnanage the sector's human resources, in particular technical assistance;
(b) to plan its activities and coordinate external aid;
(c) to improve its technical performance in certain subsectors (irrigation, forests, fruit growing, livestock and
fishery); and
(d) to ensure supervision and implementation of structural adjustment measures in the farm sector (especially
in regard to public spending/PIP).
5.     To that end, the MDRP would first of all be given assistance in setting up a human resources division in
GAPLA, not only to manage the technical assistance from external sources, but also to carry out measures conducive to
more effective use and management of the local staff.
6.     The total amount envisaged was US$7 million in foreign exchange plus roughly US$ 800,000 in local currency
(counterpart funding from the Guinea-Bissau Government), broken down as follows:
Foreign exchange:         civil works                           8.4%
vehicles and equipment               15.0%
tech.assistance, training and studies  40.0%
goods and services                   19.3%
operating costs                       3.3%
PPF and contingencies                14.0%
Local currency           civil works                           25.0%
(US$800,000 equivalent)    operating costs                     75.0%



- 2 -
Annual disbursements were to be phased in the following manner: 43% in the first year; 35.5% in the second;
and 21.5% in the third.
The actual annual disbursement figures are as follows:
Year              Percentage of the total amount
1988                            3%
1989                            18%
1990                           32%
1991                           25%
1992                            12%
1993                            2 %
1994                            7%
It is difficult to compare these indicators with the three-year time frame envisaged, inasmuch as PASA was
granted three extensions (at year-end 1991, 1992 and 1993 respectively). But if we compare execution years 1988 and
1989 with the scheduled Year One and execution years 1992 to 1994 with the scheduled Year Three, it is clear that the
investment capability during the initial years of the project has been overestimated, since only half of the outlay
stated for Year One (1988 and 1989) actually took place, while the level of real spending rose considerably in Year Two
(1990 and 1991). These figures are convincing evidence that, as has proved to be the case in other projects, the start-up
is the most difficult phase of public sector projects in Guinea-Bissau. It is also the stage where attainment of planned
goals is most difficult, as may be seen from the following figures:
Execution Years                        Scheduled Year             Deviation (+ or -)
1988 + 89: 31%              One:                 43%                   -22.0%
1990 + 91: 57%              Two:                 35.5%                + 21.5%
1992 + 93: 22%              Three:               21.5%                 + 0.5%
7.     In terms of components, the following table compares the estimated implementation percentages with those
actually achieved and/or disbursed, along with the relevant deviation:
Component            Planned % of total     Actual % of total   Deviation (+ or -)
GAPLA                        39.7                 45                   +5.3
Agriculture                   9.8                 21                  +11.2
DEPA/fruit                 0.8                  9                   +8.2
DHAS/irrigation            9                   12                   +3

Forestry                     16                   11                    -5
MDRA/General                  9                    7                    -2
Fishery                      19.5                  9                   -10.5
The immediate conclusion to be drawn from the above figures is that, for the most part, the actual distribution
of the investment differed greatly from the one projected, largely due to three factors:
(a) lack of detail at the planning stage, which would seem to have been fairly intentional, given the specific
features of the agriculture sector and the policy changes that were anticipated in the years following the
planning and start-up of the project (1986/87 onward);
(b) emphasis given to management by objectives, coinciding with the very significant reshaping of PASA from
mid-1991 onwards; this was reflected in the closing of certain components (irrigation, forestry, and fruit



- 3 -
crops), the launching of new activities (ponteiros, palm groves, agricultural research) and the
strengthening/intensification of certain components (GAPLA/training, general support to the MDRA); and
(c) the very nature of PASA, viz. general institutional support to the MDRA, which from the start
presupposed (in the Guinea-Bissau context) structural changes and some degree of temporary organizational
instability.
8.     The structure of the investment is also illustrated by a comparative table. In this instance, however, a direct
comparative analysis is more difficult due to the different categories of investment expenses during the two periods in
question. At any rate, a grouping of related outlays results in the following picture:
SERVICE SUPPLIER                   VOLUME (man-months)                % OF TOTAL
Local Technical Staff (total)               686                               8%

USA/Brazil                                 5
Others/Various (GB)                                                           5%
An initial examination makes it clear that one of the aims of projects financed by the World Bank and IDA--
i.e., to stimulate the local market-was attained, since roughly one third of the total value of the services provided
for PASA came from the domestic market (8% of the technicians and 24% of the companies or small suppliers): and
that figure does not take into account the contract for construction of the new MDRA building, which was awarded to a
local consortium for execution in 1994. This would raise the level of PASA input from one third to 40%, a rather
impressive increase. The undeveloped status of the Guinean market meant that two thirds of the services (9% for
individual technicians and 59% for the companies supplying technical assistance, as well as equipment and materials) had
to be secured from external sources.
9.     Bearing in mind the principal objectives targeted for the PASA project (which were addressed briefly in
paragraph 4 of this section B of the report), we shall attempt a general assessment of their degree of achievement:
(a) The programs financed by PASA led to a perceptible improvement in the management of human resources,
to wit:
(i)    MDRA had never had a human resources division, but one has now been created in GAPLA.
(ii)   An inventory and detailed register of MDRA staff was prepared.
(iii)    During the PASA project, GAPLA was the most active MDRA unit in promotion and
delivery of local technical assistance.  Twelve local technicians were engaged under
PASA/PIR, starting in 1991.



- 4 -
(iv)    The review and improved management of the agriculture PIP as part of PASA resulted in
significant rationalization of the external technical assistance services at MODRA (from
over 80 technical staff in 1988 down to the present 36).
(b) The planning function and the start of improved coordination of external aid--factors that are closely
interrelated, given the importance of such aid in supporting the country's public spending--were greatly
strengthened under PASA. They can even be said to represent one of the project's chief contributions to
the MDRA, in light of the following advances:
(i)     Strengthening of the role performed by GAPLA, which became one of the principal
MDRA general directorates, plus the creation in that body of a skeleton team of local
technicians with improved capacities in project identification, monitoring and evaluation as
well as other elements of agricultural policy;
(ii)    The execution of a series of studies and reflections that were vital to the process of
fornulating and implementing agricultural sector policy;
(iii)    The conduct of training activities in the country (four courses, each lasting six weeks) on
planning and management;
(iv)    Although the technical assistance to DGFC was acknowledged to be useful, the various
inputs do not appear to have been utilzed in their entirety due to factors relating to
organization of the DGFC and its management methods;
(v)     While, on the one hand, the two pilot tests on the implementation of small-scale
irrigation works in the eastern part of the country were not successful, it is equally true
that domestic technical capacities were created at DHAS for the design and monitoring of
small irrigation works in the east.
C.      Agreement of Implementation of PASA Components
10.     Section B of this report provided an idea of the overall results of PASA, viewed from different angles (by year;
by component; by the type of service rendered; and by the type of expenditure), but always from a global perspective and
in comparison with the goals and plans originally set for the project. In this chapter, we shall concentrate on a
quantification of the physical and organizational activities actually performed. Our discussion here will be based on the
major components of PASA--or, rather, on the subprojects that it carried out, which were the following:
a)      Global support for MDRA (GAPLA; Human Resources and Training; Statistics; Infrastructures and
Works; Equipment and Operational Support, etc.)
b)      Livestock production (studies and pilot action)
c)      Forests (legislation; regulations; taxation; nurseries and research; and pilot action)
d)      Crop irrigation (surveys; studies of irrigation sites in the valleys of eastern Guinea-Bissau; two "small
valley" pilot projects)
e)      Fruit growing (support for the Quebo Center) and applied agricultural research
f)      Fisheries (statistical data collection and processing system on the ZEE; training activities)



-5-
a)      Global support for MDRA
11.    This group includes the following subprojects: (i) support for creation of a human resources division in
GAPLA; (ii) training programs; (iii) support for general agricultural planning; (iv) support for agricultural statistics;
and (v) creation of physical infrastructure and construction, plus material assistance for MDRA.
The following steps were taken with specific regard to item (i):
*   The GAPLA Human Resources Division was created;
*   The Human Resources Division was provided with office furniture and equipment, and data
processing equipment;
*   An inventory/register of MDRA personnel was conducted from 1991 to 1994, and its own software,
suitable for management and computerized payroll processing, was created;
*   A number of regulations were drafted on the recruitment of personnel, careers, professional profiles and
other matters.
12.    As to the items in point (ii), the DRH served as the pivot to develop a series of various types of training
activities, despite the fact that it was the PASA manager (director and technical advisor) who was responsible for the
identification and design of training areas, so that they would comply with and be included in the PASA objectives.
13.    In item (iii), the activities in support of global agricultural planning represented one of the project's central
areas.
*   Extemal TA amounting to roughly 99 man-months was supplied, as well as 36 man-months of local TA.
In the conduct of studies, 11 man-months of external advisory services and 27 man-months of such services
from local consultants were guaranteed;
*   Various items of office fumiture and office and data processing equipment were supplied. Repairs were
made and minor remodeling works carried out in the present main MDRA/GAPLA building. Vehicles (5
jeeps and 4 scooters) were furnished for GAPLA;
*   Analysis/design work was carried out, which led to drafting a basic document, "strategy of the
agricultural sector-preliminary version", in May 1990;
*   Two reviews and evaluations of the agricultural PIP situation were conducted;
*   An innovative MDRA study/action program entitled "Ways to Modernize Farming in Guinea-Bissau"
was conducted for the benefit of the ponteiros in October 1992, along with a series of three conferences on
topics of interest (marketing of farm products, agro-processing and credit/agroeconomic management in the
pontas). Three trips/commercial missions were carried out by the ponteiros to Portugal, Brazil and Cape
Verde;
*   The structure and distribution of tasks within GAPLA were reorganized, thus spurring greater
institutional rationalization, the emergence of new staff (at least four high level technicians) and the
improvement of the PIP through the introduction of and training in a new method for the preparation and
monitoring of that prograrn;



- 6 -
*   The draft version of the new MDRA organizational law was prepared and was used as the basis for
discussion with the Civil Service Ministry;
*   An accounting unit was set up and put into operation within GAPLA;
*   Assistance was furnished in the drafting and publication of a joint executive ruling on land concessions and
in the elaboration of agroeconomic criteria for evaluating requests for land concessions;
The greatest impact of the activities carried out by PASA can be said to have occurred in the above areas,
particularly after the realignment of the project in mid-91 and the assignment of a chief technical advisor to the director
of GAPLA (and of PASA).
14.    The following achievements were promninent in the areas cited in item (iv) above - agricultural strategies - which
were also addressed by the GAPLA team:
* The GAPLA Statistics Division was provided with office furniture and equipment, as well as data
processing equipment;
*   Three specific works were compiled and published: a revised version of the 1988-89 agricultural census,
in 1992; the first ponteiros census; and the first survey of fruit crops: cashew nuts and mangoes).
*   Specific aid was provided for conduct of the agricultural census in 1988-89, along with countless
individual activities in the area of statistical compilation;
15.    The activities carried out under item (v) above - general support for the MDRA - led to the following
achievements:
* Repairs and some construction work to improve the central MDRA facilities (the office of the Minister,
MDRA meeting room, DGA, DGFC etc.);
*   Equipment and office furniture were provided and numerous operating expenses were paid;
*   The engineering design and architectural blueprints for the new MDRA building were ca-ied out by a
local firm (PROJECTAE). The bidding process and contract award was held from April through June
1993;
* Cofinancing agreements for training activities have been signed by the MDRA and the Portuguese
Ministry of Agriculture;
*   Support was provided for the NMRA Agricultural Documentation Center in the form of training and
materials, as well as the for the National Unit of Agricultural Extension (overseas study for the Unit's
head, plus office furniture and equipment).
b)      Livestock Production
16.    The activities in the following list were centered on, and directly managed by, the Livestock DG:
* The conduct, under contract, of two studies--entitled "Traditional Systems of Livestock Production in
Guinea-Bissau" and "Socioeconomic Situation of Animal Health in Guinea-Bissau"--by GAPTEC
between mid-1990 and mid-1994;



- 7 -
*   In parallel to above studies, the livestock situation of 120 villages (in a first phase, in 1990 and 1991) and
that of another 40 (second phase, in 1992 and 1993) in the regions of Bafata, Gabu and Oio/Bissora was
monitored;
*   Various technical training activities were conducted for the benefit of the subproject's national team (the
director general, veterinarians and zootechnicians) through trips abroad--mainly in Portugal--and the
holding of technical workshops in Bissau;
*   The equipment and office supplies provided for the DGP included two PCs and printers;
*   A pilot project to be presented for financing by the PIR (Rural Incentives Program) (IFAD funded) was
prepared, based on the studies that had been conducted.
c)      Forestry
17.    The activities in this sector were divided into two distinct stages. The first--focusing on global support for the
DGFC--ran from the start of PASA to mid-91 and underwent a number of changes. The second, from mid-91 to
September 1993, centered on a pilot activity for palm grove renewal in the northern part of the country, based on the
identification made in the previous stage. A summary description of the activities appears below:
*   A draft of the proposed forestry law was prepared and was later (1992) approved and published in the
Official Gazette;
*   A draft of the DGFC organizational law and by-laws was prepared and is being discussed for application;
*   A program was drawn up to support the proposal submitted by the DGFC on action to be perfonned in
regard to the protection of environment;
*   The forestry inventory of two important timber company concessions (Maudo San6 and FOLBI) was
carried out;
*   A study was carried out that permitted the identification of the technical and economic bases for forestry
taxation;
*   Between 1989 and 1990, technical assistance was provided by two experts (a forestry engineer for 18
man-months and another for field trials/tree nurseries for one month).
*   Investments were made at the Embunhe and Canchungo (palm grove) nurseries.
*   A wide range of equipment and specific materials for forests and fauna was purchased;
*   oil palm (Hibrido tenera) seedlings were imported and planted in nurseries over 18 months. Nearly
55,000 plants were distributed during the 1993 rainy season (July to September);
*   A few training activities (forest and palm-grove guards) were carried out in Bissau and a number of others
outside the country (Portugal, CMte d'lvoire, Cape Verde, Gambia and elsewhere).
18.    The activities had no impact on the production of plants in nurseries or, consequently, on the reforestation
activities (except in the case of palm groves) or on additional training at the intermediate and base levels (forest guards),
even after the DGFC had increased its intervention capacity.  This was largely due to the institutional and



- 8 -
organizational situation of the government agency responsible for the sector, as noted in the evaluation of PASA that
was conducted in mid-1991.
d)     Irrigation
19.    The activities conducted in this sphere were divided into two groups: support for the DHAS (the Irrigation
Department of the DGA) in the form of training to prepare and manage projects which would utilize the water resources
and small valleys in the eastern part of the country; and the start of a pilot operation build those irrigation systems in two
villages of the Gabu region.
The following specific activities were performed:
* Technical assistance was rendered by the Dutch company EUROCONSULT who provided a specialist in
irrigated farm engineering for a total of 30 man-months. This resulted in the creation of a project unit
to monitor projects of the type indicated above (with at least three technicians trained for this purpose);
   Preliminary engineering designs were prepared for those irrigation sites with potential and advantages
that had been identified in the eastern part of the country;
-  Various items of equipment and technical material (satellite and aerial photographs, design, topography,
hydraulics, soil surveys, generators, etc.), were provided;
- On-the-job training and other training activities were provided overseas (Portugal, Japan and Burkina-
Faso);
i  In two villages of the Bafata region, work was started on a pair of pilot activities for the construction of
small-scale irrigation structures to develop the existing small valleys;
*   Financing was guaranteed for various DHAS operating expenses.
e)      Fruit Growing and Applied Agricultural Research
20.    This component was not spelled out in detail at the start. The only stipulation was that investment should be
made in the Quebo Fruit Center, along with other funding, based on a project financed by Portugal for the same center.
With the passage of time, other initiatives in the realm of fruit production appeared and were supported; and, based on
the evaluation made in mid-1991, the component's scope was extended to include applied agricultural research
(cultivation techniques and upland crops). The activities conducted were:
*  Investments in equipment for the Quebo Fruit Growing Center;
*   A numnber of other physical investments in the Contuboel Center, related to the cultivation techniques and
upland crop subprograms;
*  Three years of training (1991, 1992 and 1993) in fruit growing, provided in Brazil/IPA for three mid-
level technicians from DEPA;
*  The import of large quantities of vitroplants which were planted in Quebo;
*  Two manuals produced on citrus growing (3,000 copies) and bee-keeping (several hundred).



- 9 -
*   The trials of cultivation techniques held in Contuboel in crop years 1991-92 and 1992-93 with certain
crops--such as "bacil" corn (Zea mays), "cabalo" corn (sorghum), cassava, and beans--produced some
results.
21.    Given the expenditures and efforts deployed in this area--especially at the Quebo Center--and the other
cofinancing used for this purpose (Portugal), it was logical to expect that more concrete results would be forthcoming,
namely in the production and sale of fruit plants to farmers. This has not yet been the case, even in terms of minimum
achievements.
As to the applied agricultural research activities, identified following the review of PASA in mid-1991, two
years do not provide sufficient time to obtain solid technical answers. But it is important that the present INPA (formerly
the DEPA) find a way to continue these two small-scale programs of recognized value.
f)     Fisheries
22.    We shall not enter into detail concerning the PASA component associated with fisheries in this report, due to
our obvious lack of technical and professional expertise, since our field of specialization is agriculture. Briefly stated, the
most prominent activities were the following:
*  The establishment in the Fisheries Ministry of a center for gathering, processing and disseminating
statistical data on industrial fishing in Guinea-Bissau.
*   Various training courses overseas were attended by a number of upper and mid-level technical staff.
Others were held in Bissau (observers, computer specialists, etc. and training materials were provided).
*  Between 1989 and 1991, roughly 50 man-months of external technical assistance were provided by three
specialists, as well as three man-months of occasional external advisory services.
PASA was unquestionably one of the public projects that rated highest in terms of achievement, not only
because of its broad institutional support, but also thanks to its very flexible management, which enabled PASA to
identify activities as the project evolved, although it should have focused more closely on the areas targeted for
intervention. Suffice it to mention the many important basic studies that were conducted (more than ten); the enormous
quantity of physical items acquired (two dozen vehicles, two dozen computers, a dozen groups of motorized pumps,
almost a dozen generators, more than 300 bicycles, more than a hundred scooters, hundreds of thousands of improved
plants, etc.); the volume and areas of training introduced (five hundred man-months, an impressive figure); the number
of supplier companies involved (90 of them, including 40 local operators), the technical assistance guaranteed (about 460
man/months, including 130 local man/months) among other inputs.
Irrespective of the problems encountered, the levels of efficacy achieved and the errors that were undoubtedly
committed, the magnitude of efforts deployed by PASA and the project's impact on MDRA structures (in particular, the
central units), assuredly constituted one of the mainstays of its operations between 1988 and 1994.
D.     Role of the World Bank/IDA and of the MDRA - Achievements and Limits
23.    It goes without saying that the role played by the World Bank as the source and coordinator of external aid
(64% in the form of an IDA credit and 36% covered by a Dutch grant) must be different from that of MDRA, the
beneficiary of the project as well as its operational manager, and it is from that standpoint that they will need to be
analyzed.



- 10-
During the first two years, less than close attention was paid to this aspect [sic], basically because the delays
affecting deposits of the NLG installments into the World Bank led to the IDA credit being used for certain payments
that should have been made out of the Dutch grant. This situation started to improve considerably at the end of 1991,
when the IDA credit remained practically untouched, the existing balance being earmarked to pay for the construction of
the new MDRA building.
24.    In addition to the above-mentioned problem in terms of the delays affecting the Dutch grant, another problem
occurred in the area of financial management: the project special account was not operational from the end of 1991,
which led to it hardly being used at all, especially when operating expenditures were concerned, a fact that obviously
jeopardized PASA's operating capacity.
The basic reason laid in the Government's inability to contribute counterpart funds in local currency to PASA's
operating expenditures, which meant that there were no records of local contributions against which the account could be
replenished.
25.    The serious issue of wages and living conditions for government workers in Guinea-Bissau is going to result in
more and more of the best technicians leaving the Government, including many who have received training and acquired
know-how within the context of PASA and other projects. In 1991, the World Bank began to approve and recruit a
number of local technicians as PASA consultants, at incentive wage levels (US$600-1,300 per month) as well as a
number of basic and middle-level posts. This was the only way to "keep" those technicians at MDRA/PASA, and we
see no other way of solving the problem.
The projects will always have to recruit/pay for local technical assistance, selected by transparent methods
(competition) as a means of promoting technical quality. In addition, the central govemment entities should no longer be
the primary beneficiaries, but instead the assistance should be transferred to bodies that are more representative of the
agricultural sector (associations, enterprises, local agencies/regions, NGOs, etc.). Support to public central bodies would
be kept to a l.iinimum, only when required but action should be taken to mnake certain specific bodies as autonomous as
possible (parastatals) and promote the best technicians.
E.     Project Sustainability. Impact on MDRA's Future Activities
26.    While it is difficult to estimate the extent of the impact of projects of the PASA type, which are dominated by
the institutional support component, since the establishment of criteria for a good or a bad impact are very dependent on
both analyst and on the beneficiary, there is no doubt, from the number and extent of the interventions generated by the
project, that there has been an obvious impact on the central MDRA services involved.
Without this project, it would not have been possible for most of its Directorates, starting with GAPLA, to
obtain the necessary material resources (vehicles, furniture, office and computer equipment, technical resources,
resources for day-to-day operations), expand their technical capabilities (external and local), or develop large-scale
programs to train or transfer know-how to the local teams. These are all aspects based in the long and exhaustive list of
support activities addressed by the PASA.
GAPLA, the Agricultural Planning Directorate of MDRA. in our view the most important agencv and the one
that should be hierarchically closest to the Minister, still does not influence all the MDRA functions and agroeconomic
aspects. It is namely the case of those aspects related to the operating budget (OGE), still highly dependent on DGA and
DAF, and not in balance with the Public Investment Program (PIP). The same occurs with certain special funds, such as
the Forestry Fund, the management of which needs to be overhauled and improved.
* Translator's note: This sentence refers to proceeding paragraphs which have been omitted from the
summarized version of the report.



- 11-
27.    Despite these imponderables, the impact of PASA was positive in that it provided a very wide variety of
resources, such that MDRA was able to function during the project period with at least a minimum level of effectiveness.
It was also positive in that it opened up new working areas at MDRA, some even unprecedented, such as the linkage
with the ponteiros/private farmers, the strong boost for staff training, and certain pilot areas (palm growing, fruit-
growing, preparation of irrigation projects.). It provided MDRA with a number of basic technical and economic
analyses that were decisive for the conduct of actions in such sectors as livestock, ponteiros, public investment, and
reorganization of agricultural research, among others. It helped to create and boost the role of certain technical teams
comprised of promising young local professionals, in particular at GAPLA, and in the livestock, irrigation and
forestry sectors. Through its broad range of activities, it helped to create an overall vision of the agriculture sector at
the central level (GAPLA), supported by a number of studies and a variety of training activities, facilitating contact and
discussion with other government agencies (Ministry of Finance, Planning, Central Bank, etc.) while also helping to
streamline the resources earmarked for public investment (reductions in such areas as the PIP, ongoing projects, volume
of technical assistance, etc.).
28.    The aspects mentioned in the foregoing paragraph represent a few examnples presaging a certain degree of
sustainability for MDRA's activities in the immediate future. Nonetheless, there are still certain risks and issues that
PASA has not yet succeeded in addressing or overcoming, either because they did not fall within its scope or because of
its own limitations.
We would repeat that the institutional problems affecting MDRA (and indeed the country's entire civil
service) have been the principal reason why no project has succeeded in achieving better results/impacts. Until
radical measures are taken to rationalize the personnel situation, clarify (in practice) the functions of the various
departments in MDRA and bring greater discipline and rigor to public sector management, the serious situation
regarding the salaries paid to government technicians will inevitably mean that the better ones will quit the public service
as and when they find better opportunities in the private sector, while the less capable will remnain at MDRA.
29.    ConcJusion. Despite the problems with technical assistance in the initial phase (1988-1990), in terms of
inflated numbers of experts and, in certain sectors (planning and overall management), inadequate quality and
inappropriate profiles, PASA was relaunched in a more positive direction following the mid-term review of July 1991,
achieving its best performance between the end of 1991 and mid-1994.
At the close of the project in September 1994, there were no 'white elephants" and no critical or controversial
situations were noted. Quite the contrary: a large volume of technical work had been done and the know-how of several
local technical teams had been enhanced. It is essential that MDRA be able to continue to use and streamline those
resources even more; to this end, it needs to undergo radical organizational and structural reforms, and a number of
proposals have been submitted along those lines, some of which emanate from this project.
