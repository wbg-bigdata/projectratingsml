REPORT A1N1D RECO;LENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE IVORY COAST
FOR A COCOA PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan, in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$7.5 million,
to assist in financing a cocoa planting and rehabilitation project in
Ivory Coast.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's second loan to the Ivory
Coast for agriculture. The project was identified in 1965 by the Bank's
Permanent lission in West Africa. It was prepared by the French company
Societe d'Etudes pour le Developpement Economique et Social (SEDES)
which submitted a draft feasibility study for review to a Bank's pre-
appraisal mission in February/iMarch 1969. The project was appraised
during November/December 1969.
3.        Negotiations were held in Wlashington during April 22-27,1970.
The Government was represented by i'tr. Andr'e Hovine, Director of the
Autonomous Amortization Fund, hKessrs. Konan Lambert and Henri Allot,
respectively Chief of Cabinet and Technical Adviser of the 1Minister of
Agriculture, &r. Bra Kanon, Director of the Societe d'Assistance
Technique pour la Modernisation Agricole de la C6te d'Ivoire (SATN[ACI),
Mr. Robinet, Director of the Cocoa and Coffee Department of SATIACI,
Messrs. Nouama and Batigne, respectively First Secretary and Technical
Adviser of the Elnbassy of Ivory Coast in Washington,
4.        The proposed loan would constitute the Bank's fourth lending
operation in the Ivory Coast. The following is a sumnary statement of
Bank loans to Ivory Coast as of April 30, 1970:

On the road loan (IVC 542) the reasons for delays in disbursements were
discussed in the President's report and recommendation of March 12, 1970
on a proposed loan for an education project. The three loans (IVC 611,
612 and 613 of June 13, 1969) for an oil pal-m and coconut development
project, were made effective on December 30, 1969 and disbursements are
just beginning.
5.       In June 1965, IFC took a participation equivalent to US$2014,000
in the capital of the Banque Ivoirienne de Developpement Industriel,
(BDI).
6.       Feasibility studies being conducted under the existing road
loan (IvC 542) are expected to lead to presentation of a second road
project to the Executive Directors during FY 1971.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
7.       Borrower:                 Republic of the Ivory Coast.
Pur%pose:                 to assist in financing the plant-
ing of about 19,000 ha and the
rehabilitation of about 38,000
ha of cocoa, and a study for a
second phase cocoa planting
program.



-3-
Amount:                   a loan in various currencies
equivalent to US$7.5 million.
Amortization:             in 15 years, including a 7-
year period of grace, through
semi-annual installments
beginning October 1, 1977 and
ending April 1, 1985.
Commitment charge:        3/4 of 1% per annum.
Interest rate:            7% per annum.
PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        A detailed appraisal report entitled "Cocoa Project - Ivory
Coast" (PA-41) dated Ikay 4, 1970 is attached.
9.        Cocoa is the Ivory Coast's third largest export earner after
coffee and timber, and cocoa exports from the Ivory Coast account for
about 11% of total world trade. Production has increased about three-
fold since 1960, primarily as a result of acreage expansion. In fact,
most farms are producing under traditional methods and give a low yield.
Farms using high yielding planting material and employing improved
establishment and maintenance techniques should greatly increase output
per farm and protect their omers against the vagaries of weather and
world prices.
10.       These would be the objectives of the proposed project, as
would other cocoa planting programs in the Government's 1971-1975
Cocoa Development Plan which envisages the planting of 59,000 ha and
the rehabilitation of 47,000 ha of cocoa.  The project, wJhich would
consist of the planting of about 19,COO ha and the rehabilitation of
about 38,000 ha, includes a) provision of adequate extension and
associated training services; b) provision of improved seeds and
materials; c) provision of credit to farmers for fertilizer,
insecticides, spraying equipment and cash required for hired labor;
d) construction of a warehouse to facilitate input distribution;
e) a cadastral survey for program implementation and f) a study for
a second phase cocoa planting program.
11.       The project is estimated to cost US$12.6 million, of which
US$5.5 million would be foreign expenditure and US$7.1 million local.
Farmers wJould provide the equivalent of US$2.7 million, the Government
US$3.4 million, and the Bank US$7.5 million, including US$l.0million
for interest on the Bank loan during project execution. Thus, the Bank
loan would cover local expenditure amounting to US$1.1 million. As
noted in para 22 below, the Ivory Coast is pursuing a sound domestic
financial policy and is making every effort to mobilize development
assistance from abroad to maintain the momentum of its development.



Against this background and given the importance of the project in the
countryts development program it is considered that the circumstances
fully justify participation by the Bank on the scale proposed.
12.       Of project costs, US$9.0 million would be for new planta-
tions, US$3.2 million for rehabilitation and US$0.4 million for the
study. Farmers credit for new plantations would cover the cost of
fertilizer, insecticides and sprayers together with cash totalling
CFAF 14,000 per ha to meet the cost of hired labor. There would be
a grace period of 4 years from planting during which interest would
be waived. Repayment of principal would be over the following eight
years by equal installments with interest at 5 1/2 percent. For
rehabilitation, farmers would receive credit for 80% of the cost of
insecticides and sprayers during the two-year period of rehabilitation.
Interest would be capitalized during this period and repayments would
be made over the following two years, again with interest at 5 1/2 per
cent.
13.       The agency with primary responsibility for implementing the
project would be the Soci6te d'Assistance Technique pour la 21odernisa-
tion Agricole de la Cote d'Ivoire (SATMACI). SATM4ACI, which was
established in April 1958 as a public corporation in charge of
extension work and implementation of agricultural programs, would
evaluate the creditworthiness of credit applicants, distribute inputs,
provide extension services and collect repayments. Its principal
activities at present consist of providing extension for cocoa, rice,
coffee, and in assisting in rice milling and marketing as wiell as
livestock operations. SATN4ACI's technical management is sound and its
accounting system satisfactory. However, its financial position
needed improvement because of inadequate prnmanent capital
and delays in receiving funds from the Government to finance agreed
operations.  SATItACI was reorganized on lines recommended by
the Compagnie Frangaise d'Organisation (COFROR) and complementary steps
are being taken by the Government, mainly through the provision of
additional permanent capital and the transfer of the rice marketing
and milling activities of SATNIACI to a new statutory corporation.
14.       In order to ensure successful and timely implementation of
the project, the Government has agreed to set up a Project Revolving
Fund which would be used to meet, as promptly as needed, its share of
the project's cost. A Project IManager, whose qualifications and
experience would be acceptable to the Bank, would be appointed. Also,
a Project Coordinating Committee would be established, in which would
be represented other institutions involved in the project's execution:
the Institut Franqais du Cafe et du Cacao (IFCC), which would supply
seeds and carry out extension training, the Banque Nationale pour le
Developpement Agricole (BNDA), the Government's primary agricultural
lending agency, which would serve as the channel for credit funds
and repayments and would maintain credit control accounts, and the
Caisse de Soutien et de Stabilisation des Prix des Produits Agricoles
(CSSPPA), an autonomous agency whose most important function is to
protect farmers from seasonal price fluctuations by guaranteeing for



each crop year a fixed farm-gate price. The Committee, which would
include also representatives of the Ministry of Planning and of the
Pfiinistry of Economic and Financial Affairs, would be chaired by the
Minister of Agriculture or his designate.
15.       Procurement of fertilizer, insecticides, sprayers and
vehicles (totalling about Us$5.0 million) would be made on the basis
of international competitive bidding. Local manufacturers of
imported goods would be allowed a preference of 15%. In practice
this preference would apply only to fertilizer, and only after 1972,
when a proposed fertilizer plant in the Ivory Coast is expected to be
in operation. The proposed loan would be disbursed against the c.i.f.
cost of imported materials, against the foreign exchange costs of the
study and for interest on the loan,and in varying percentages against
project administration, extension services and locally procured
materials.
16.       The project's primary benefit would be the increased produc-
tion of cocoa, resulting in substantial foreign exchange earnings for
the Ivory Coast and higher income for participating farmers. Based
on a c.i.f. New York price of UScents 27 per lb, it is estimated that
at full production the project would contribute about US$9.0 million
a year in net foreign exchange earnings from new plantations and about
US$5.0 million from rehabilitation. At the assumed price and taking
into account the full family labor costs, the internal rate of return
is estimated at about 20% for new plantations and about 35% for
rehabilitation.
PART IV - LBO-AL I1iSTRtULThTS AI'D AUTHORITY
17.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Ivory Coast
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
18.       The draft Loan Agreement followfs the general pattern of
similar agreements for agricultural projects. The Loan Agreement
would be made effective only after the establishment of a Project
Revolving Fund and a Project Coordinating Committee (Section 7.01).
PART V  - THE ECON0I'1
19.       A IMemorandum on the Economic Situation and Prospects of the
Ivory Coast, dated July 3, 1968 (AF-76a) was circulated to the
Executive Directors on July 15, 1968. An economic mission visited the
Ivory Coast in November/December 1969. Its draft report is now being
discussed with the Government and it should be distributed to the



- 6 -
Executive Directors in a few weeks. The findings of the mission stress
the impressive growth of the economy. Over the three years 1966-68,
GDP increased by 33 percent at current prices including a record 16 per
cent in 1968. As price increases have been moderate, the annual
average rate of growth in real terms over the period may be estimated
at oVer 7 percent, in line with the trend observed since independence
(1960).
20.       Exports - of which coffee, cocoa and timber account for 80
percent - have remained the main moving force in the economy. In 1968
exports increased by a record 30 percent as a result of increased
supply and favorable demand for the three main export products. The
trade surplus,which had fluctuated around CFAF 10 billion per year
since 1960,exceeded CFAF 25 billion, and the balance on goods and
services, which had shown a very small surplus up to 1964 and a -row-
ing deficit in the following years, became positive at CFAF 9 billion
(US$36.5 million) in 1968. The balance of payment has remained strong
despite the growing outflow of factor payments and private transfers
whose net combined-amount reached about CFAF 18.7 billion in 1968, or
twice that of 1963. The Ivory Coast now holds over half the total net
foreign assets of the seven-member West African Monetary Union,
representing three months of imports.
21.       On the basis of past experience, the economic prospects of
the Ivory Coast can be viewed with optimism. However, prospects for
the main export commodities, notably coffee, cocoa and timbe; point
to slower growth. Exportable timber of the best qualities is
becoming less abundant; world coffee demand is growing slaoly. Mlain-
tenance of a high rate of economic development will consequently depend
to a large extent upon further diversification of agriculture and the
development of other sectors. In part this will result frcm recent
and contemplated investments in the production of cocoa, palm oil,
copra, bananas, pineapple, rubber and cotton, and the continued success
in raising production of "superior" foodstuffs, notably rice and fish.
Industry and construction still account for only 20 percent of GDP but
they have shown the fastest growth. Gross sales by industrial firms
have increased fivefold between 1960 and 1968.
22.       The rapid expansion of the economy has been accompanied by
rising public investment. The latter has risen more rapidly than
public savings, despite a continued increase in government revenues.
Thus, the share of public investment financed by public savings has
declined from over 70 percent over the years 1960-66 to an estimated
52 percent in the following period, including the budget forecast for
the current year (1970). In the period 1971-1975 the public invest-
ment program is likely to be in the order of CFAF 220 billion,
including the full cost of the two large Kossou and San Pedro projects.
To this have to be added substantial requirements for debt service.
It is not realistic to expect that more than, say, twro-thirds of



- 7 -
these requirements could be raised from internal resources, leaving
external financing needs over the period of the order of CFAF 100
billion (US$400 million). TWhile a substantial part of this represents
import requirements for projects which are suitable for financing by
external lenders, there is likely to be a gap to be covered by
financing part of the local expenditure on high priority projects,
notably in agriculture.
23.       The financial prospects raise no problems for the medium
term. The current debt service ratio (4 to 5 per cent of exports of
goods and services) is low. By 1974, however, the Ivory Coast will
start reimbursing the bulk of the external loans, including those
contracted for the Kossou and San Pedro projects. It is thus likely
that debt service during the seventies, including debt to be contracted
for the financing of the l971-1975 development program, could rise to
about 10 per cent of export proceeds. This ratio should still be
manageable in light of the good growth potential of the economy.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
24.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
25.       I recommend that the Dxecutive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
