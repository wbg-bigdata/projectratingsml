REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO FIJI FOR A SUGAR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Fiji for the equivalent of US$12 million to help finance a Sugar Develop-
ment Project. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of
grace, with interest at 8.5 percent per annum. $6 million of the proceeds of
the loan would be used by the Government to help finance the construction and
improvement of roads, seawalls and tidal gates. The remaining $6 million
would be passed to the Fiji Development Bank (FDB), on the same terms as those
of the Bank loan, for relending to settlers, the Native Land Development
Corporation, the Fiji Sugar Corporation and the Drainage Boards.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report titled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Fiji"
(No. 376-FIJ, March 27, 1974) was circulated to the Executive Directors
on April 3, 1974 (R74-64). The next economic mission to Fiji is scheduled for
May 1976. Basic country data are given in Annex I.
3.        Fiji became independent on October 10, 1970 after nearly 100 years
as a British colony and is now an independent member of the British Common-
wealth. It is composed of a group of over 300 islands in the South Pacific
with a total land area of some 18,000 km2. It has a population of just over
560,000 of which about 90 percent live on the two main islands, Viti Levu and
Vanua Levu. The gradual transfer of political power was accompanied by a
program of local recruitment at all levels of government which has helped to
ensure competent leadership and a well managed administrative system after
independence. In the first post-independence election in April 1972, the
Alliance Party, based largely on the support of population of Fijian descent
(42 percent of the population) and European and Chinese minorities (8 percent),
retained political power. The National Federation Party, which is in the
opposition, is supported mainly by the citizens of Indian descent.
Past Economic Performance
4.        Over the past decade, real gross national product has increased
by about 5-1/2 percent a year reaching $640 per capita in 1974. At the same
time, Fiji has undergone a major transformation, moving from a predominantly
agricultural economy to one in which the provision of tourist and other
services is an important economic activity. Output in agriculture, forestry
and fisheries has remained stagnant, and as a result, this sector's share in
GNP has fallen from over 40 percent to less than 25 percent during the last
decade. It now contributes less to GNP than wholesale and retail trade. The
expansion of the service sector, which now contributes about half of GNP, has
been due mainly to the rapid growth in tourism which created demand for



- 2 -
different kinds of services, such as hotel labor, construction of hotels and
other infrastructure, transport and distributive trades. This expansion has
attracted a large number of people from rural into the urban areas, where
public investment has increased and substantial foreign capital inflows have
been attracted into hotel building.
5.        A noteworthy feature of development during the past decade has
been the significant reduction in the rate of population growth. Between 1956
and 1965, the population grew at 3.3 percent a year, but during the past ten
years the rate of growth has fallen to an average of 2 percent a year. The
fall in the rate of growth can be explained by changing social habits, rising
incomes, the Government's family planning program and an increased rate of net
migration to other countries (currently equivalent to more than half a percent
of the population each year).
6,.       However, the rate of growth in the labor force, which is still largely
determined by the population growth rate before the beginning of the last de-
cade, has continued to increase at 3 percent a year, and, despite the reason-
ably rapid growth in output in the non-agricultural sector, employment growth
has not kept pace with the growth of the labor force. Although employment
increased by about 2.5 percent a year during the past decade, the level of
unemployment increased from 4 percent to 7 percent. The leading employment
growth sectors since 1966 have been construction and commerce (including
tourism) in which employment increased by about 7 percent a year; together they
accounted for almost half of new employment during the period. On the other
hand, employment in agriculture stagnated and its share of total employment
declined during the last decade from 56 percent to 43 percent, while the share
of industry increased from 16 percent to 18 percent, and that of services
increased from 28 percent to 39 percent.
7.        The Government's fiscal effort in the past decade has been impres-
sive. Current revenues of the Central Government have increased at about
10 percent a year in real terms, and the ratio of revenues to GDP has in-
creased from less than 20 percent in the early 1960s to about 24 percent in
1974. However, significant increases in Government salaries and an expansion
in the size of the civil service have resulted in a smaller current surplus
in the last two years.
8.        During the past decade, gross investment has been relatively high
averaging about 25 percent of GDP. The most striking feature of this invest-
ment has been the sharp rise, since the late 1960s, in the share of investment
financed by foreign capital inflow. During the past five years, it is esti-
mated that about 60 percent of gross fixed capital formation was financed by
public and private foreign borrowing and by direct foreign investment, pri-
marily in the tourism sector.
9.        The limited domestic market, together with Fiji's relatively high
per capita income, has made Fiji among the most import dependent countries in
the world. The total import bill has risen steadily as a proportion of GDP
from 39 percent in 1950 to about 50 percent in the mid-1960s and 75 percent
in 1974. The factors which have contributed to this trend are the import



-3-
requirements of the tourism-industry, the growth of re-export trade and, more
recently, the rise in petroleum prices. On the export side, sugar, which
is Fiji's major export, has declined in volume over the last decade. Until
recently, this situaticn contributed to a growing trade deficit, which was,
however, offset to a considerable extent by growing receipts from tourism.
During the past two years sugar prices increased substantially and despite a
slowdown in tourism, there has been a significant improvement in Fiji's
overall balance of payments. The trade deficit as a percentage of GDP is
estimated to have declined from 38 percent in 1973 to 17 percent in 1975.
This, together with thc increase in external capital inflows, has enabled
Fiji to achieve a favorable external reserve position; net foreign exchange
reserves are estimated to have doubled in 1975 to $120 million, equivalent
to about six months of retained imports.
10.       The substantial increase in import prices and domestic wage in-
creases resulted in a high rate of inflation which, in the early part of 1974,
increased to more than 20 percent a year. Recognizing that inflation in Fiji
was, to a large extent.. a result of worldwide inflation, counter inflationary
policies were aimed pri'marily at controlling profit margins and wages.
Inflationary pressures have been moderating in recent months, but consumer
prices are still increasing at an annual rate of about 10 percent.
Growth Prospects
11.       Fiji's Seventh Development Plan for 1976-80 projects a GNP growth
rate of 7 percent a year to be achieved mainly through increasing exports and
tourism and a larger participation by the Government in the development pro-
cess. The Plan also eraphasizes development of those regions, particularly
the rural areas, which have not yet participated significantly in the bene-
fits from previous economic development. This would be accomplished through
the identification of potential growth centers in the rural areas, which
would then become foca:L points for agricultural, industrial, and other invest-
ments. The Plan also attaches high priority to providing employment to the
rapidly growing labor -rorce, which is expected to grow by 2-1/2 percent a
year.
12.       Taking into account Fiji's natural resources, the small size of the
domestic market and limaited industrialization possibilities, the Plan places
heavy reliance on increasing agricultural production. A major thrust of the
Government's development strategy is to improve the attractiveness of agricul-
tural occupations and to increase the participation of the citizens of Fijian
descent in commercial agriculture. The basic objectives of the Plan are to
increase agricultural output both for export and domestic food consumption; to
create rural employment opportunities; to raise farm incomes and to improve
the quality of rural lLfe relative to that in urban areas.    Building and
construction are expected to be the most dynamic sectors, reflecting the
increased demand for capital investment, in particular, from the Government's
capital expenditure program and the anticipated resumption of growth in
tourism.



- 4 -
13.       The overall rate of growth of investment is projected at about 11
percent a year until 1980, which is considerably higher than the average
rate of growth for the economy as a whole. Government investment is projected
to grow at 12 percent a year, a rate considered necessary to achieve the
development targets, and private investment is projected to expand at 10
percent a year. Government investment would average about 7-8 percent of GDP
during the rest of the decade and would amount to a total of about $340
million during 1976-80. A major structural change in the composition of the
Government's capital investment program for the new plan period compared to
the previous plan is the increase in the share allocated to agriculture and
rural development (from 16 percent to 23 percent). In addition, a substantial
increase in expenditure for power is projected mainly for a phased development
of a hydro-electric scheme at Monasavu Falls, which would reduce Fiji's
reliance on imported oil. About a quarter of the program would be financed
from current savings, another quarter from domestic borrowings and the re-
maining half from external grants and loans.
External Sector
14.       The short-term outlook for the balance of payments will depend
largely on the performance of sugar exports and tourism receipts. Mainly
as a result of fluctuations in the price of sugar, merchandise export earnings
will probably decline in 1976 by about 15 percent and then recover to the
current level in 1977. Assuming a recovery in tourism in 1976, an increasing
surplus on the service account would offset, to a large degree, growing
trade deficits. The expected capital inflows would finance the current
account deficit and also enable Fiji to record small overall surpluses in both
1976 and 1977. For the rest of the decade, this trend of tourism receipts
partially offsetting a growing trade deficit is expected to continue, and,
despite some increase in the current account deficits, Fiji should be able to
manage the balance of payments reasonably well, given the present relatively
high level of external reserves.
15.       At the end of 1974, the level of external debt is estimated to
have been about $160 million, of which about $40 million was public. By the
end of the decade, the level of debt could increase to about $400 million
with public debt accounting for about $140 million of the total. Debt service
payments in 1974 were about 14 percent of export receipts. For the rest
of the decade, the debt service ratio is expected to increase only moderately
to about 15 to 16 percent. Thus, Fiji remains creditworthy for Bank lending.
At present, the Bank's share in Fiji's total debt outstanding is about 9
percent and in total debt service is about 2 percent. These ratios are
expected to rise only moderately in the years ahead.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
16.       Fiji became a member of the Bank in May 1971, and the proposed pro-
ject would be the fourth Bank-financed project in Fiji, bringing total Bank
lending to $35.2 million. The first loan of $11.8 million was made in June
1971 for the construction of 67 miles of the 130-mile Suva-Nadi road. A
supplemental loan of $4.2 million for the same project was signed February 1,
1973, to-help meet an increase in the total estimated cost from $16.6 to
$31.8 million.  At the same time, Australia and New Zealand also agreed to
contribute $2.7 and $1.8 million, respectively, to help Fiji meet the in-
creased costs.  Implementation of this project is satisfactory.
17.       The second loan to Fiji ($2.2 million) was for a telecommunications
project to support the Government's 1971-75 development program. The project
provided for the expansion of local telephone systems, extension of the long
distance services throughout the main island of Viti Levu and between Viti
Levu and other islands, and the expansion of telex services to meet existing
demand. The project is proceeding satisfactorily and should be completed on
schedule by June 1976. The third loan of $5 million for a second telecommu-
nications project was made during FY76 to help finance the first three years
of the Government's 1976-80 telecommunications development program. This
loan became effective last October and progress under the project is satis-
factory.
18.       The Bank's lending program in Fiji in the next few years would
concentrate on agricultural and power development in line with the priorities
discussed in paragraphs 12 and 13 above. A proposed power loan would finance
the first phase of the Government's hydro-electric program, and is being
prepared with technical assistance from New Zealand. The project would help
to meet the demand for power of Viti Levu, reduce dependence on imported oil
and provide for significant institutional improvements in the power sector.
An agricultural project has also been identified, which may include farm in-
puts, credit and marketing facilities, extension and improved infrastructure,
to help stimulate production of rainfed rice and other subsistence crops.
External assistance for other sectors is likely to be provided by the ADB,
the European Economic Community and bilateral donors.
19.       Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as of Jan-
uary 31, 1976, and notes on the execution of the ongoing projects. No IFC
investments have been made in Fiji.
PART III - AGRICULTURE SECTOR IN FIJI
General
20.       As stated in paragraph 4 above, Fiji has undergone a major trans-
formation in the past lecade, shifting away from a predominantly rural-agri-
culture economy to one which is more service oriented. While the service



-6-
sector has been growing in the urban areas, the agricultural sector has had
increasing difficulty in attracting the resources needed to raise producti-
vity. As a result, agricultural production has stagnated and this has con-
tributed to both a growing demand for food imports and a more rapid flow of
rural people to towns. Despite the decline in agriculture's share of total
output, the sector still accounts for about 85 percent of domestic exports
and for 60 percent of total employment.
21.       Sugarcane is the most important commercial crop in Fiji and ac-
counts for 40 percent of agricultural output. Sugar is grown mainly in
alluvial areas of western Viti Levu and northern Vanua Levu (see attached
map). Coconuts, which are the second most important commercial and export
crop, are grown mainly in the coastal areas and to a lesser extent in the
interior of Vanua Levu and the outer islands. There is also a small, but
potentially important livestock and dairy industry supplying local markets
in the wet zones of Viti Levu. Rice is also grown on the main islands, pri-
marily by Indians as a subsistence crop. Fijian subsistence agriculture,
which is based mainly on the production of root crops, accounts for about
40 percent of total agricultural output. It tends to be found in the in-
terior of the islands and on land not already occupied by cane and coconuts.
Inshore sea fishing is traditional among Fijians, and the country's forests
are also an important resource.
22.       About four-fifths of the people of Fijian decent live in their
ancestral village communities of 100-200 inhabitants, referred to as mata-
qali (pronounced "ma-tang-gali"). Many are engaged in subsistence cultiva-
tion, based on an extensive system of land rotation. Although traditional
agriculture is being influenced gradually by the cash economy, it is still
isolated and contrasts sharply to commercial agriculture (e.g. sugar and
coconuts), which is export oriented.
Land Use Potential and Land Tenure
23.       It is estimated that almost a million acres, totalling 21 percent of
the land area in Fiji, are suited to arable agriculture. About half of this
land is cultivated and half has potential for future development.
24.       There are three main types of land ownership:    Fijian communally
owned lands, Crown land and freehold. Some 83 percent of all land in Fiji,
or about 3.8 million acres, is owned on a communal basis by over 6,000
mataqalis. Development of this land by Fijians or the lease of it to the
members of other groups for development may take place only after the consent
of the mataqali and the approval of the Native Land Trust Board (NLTB),
which controls and administers native land for the benefit of its Fijian
owners.
25.       About 7 percent of the land belongs to the Crown and the remaining
10 percent is freehold. The land now under freehold is the land originally
selected and negotiated for by the settler-immigrants, mostly Europeans,
before Fiji became a British Crown Colony in 1874, and thus it includes
much of the land best suited to the cultivation of cash crops.



26.       Indians constitute about half of the population of the country.
They own only about 2 percent of the land, but farm about 450,000 acres,
including most of the land producing sugar. More than 80 percent of the
Indian farmers are tenants leasing their land from mataqalis, the Crown or
freeholders.
The Sugar Industry
27.       Sugar is Fiji's largest industry, contributing 10 percent of GNP
and 70 percent of merchandise export earnings; it is the country's largest
employer, and occupies about 165,000 acres, or 37 percent of Fiji's productive
land. Annual production of raw sugar has averaged around 300,000 tons for
the last decade. About 25,000 tons are sold domestically and the remainder
exported, mainly to the United Kingdom. Productiou reached a peak of 394,000
tons in 1968, but has fallen steadily since then to 355,000 tons in 1970 and
to 269,000 tons in 1974. In addition to unfavorable weather in some
years, the major causes of falling production have been increasing salt water
intrusion along the coast, waterlogging in low-lying areas and poor field
management.
28.       Sugarcane farming developed in Fiji in the late nineteenth century,
and was characterized by plantation management and wage labor. After the
end of the indenture system in 1916 and the collapse of the sugar market in
1920, the plantation system became financially unviable and was transformed
into the tenant and small farm system which persists today. Under this sys-
tem, individual growers typically lease 10-12 acre farms and provide cane for
the mill under contract. At present, about 85 percent of the sugarcane area
is farmed by the descendants of the Indian laborers and 13.5 percent by
people of Fijian descent, mainly under leases from the NLTB. Most of the
remaining 1.5 percent of the cane area is farmed on an estate basis by the
Fiji Sugar Corporation Ltd. (FSC).
29.       Manufacture of raw sugar is the statutory monopoly of FSC, which
was established in April 1, 1973, following the Government's purchase of the
Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd. of Australia's (CSR) shares in its subsi-
diary, South Pacific Sugar Mills Ltd. Four of the five original mills are
still in operation. FSC, now almost entirely owned by the Government, has
maintained a technical and marketing arrangement with CSR which is due to
expire after March 31, 1976. Arrangements have been made, however, for CSR
to continue to provide technical assistance to FSC in the most important
technical aspects of its operations. The Government has also established a
wholly Government-owned Company, Fiji Sugar Marketing Company Ltd., which
has a tripartite agreement with FSC and CSR, under which CSR will serve as
the marketing agent for Fiji's sugar exports until March 31, 1977. The Gov-
ernment has agreed that FSC would continue to maintain appropriate arrange-
ments to ensure its technical and marketing efficiency (Section 4.06 of the
Loan Agreement).
Future Agricultural Development Programs
30.       During the period of the Seventh Development Plan, sugar is expected
to play an important part in Fiji's overall development. A major expansion



- 8-
program is underway to open new lands for sugarcane production, to reclaim
lands on which production has fallen due to poor drainage and to raise pro-
ductivity on existing cane lands. Other programs for agriculture include
the establishment of estates on native land to increase the participation
of the mataqalis in commercial agriculture, the development of good agri-
cultural land for settlement, diversification of agricultural production
through promotion of other priority crops and livestock, and improvement of
marketing, handling and distribution facilities.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
31.       The project was identified by a Bank mission in September/October
1974 and prepared by the Government of Fiji with assistance from the FAO/
IBRD Cooperative Programme. It was appraised by the Bank in July/August
1975 and negotiated in February 1976. The Government's negotiating team was
led by Mr. S. Siwatibau, Permanent Secretary for Finance. A loan and project
summary is attached as Annex III.
32.       In support of the Government's new priorities, FSC initiated an in-
vestment program in 1973 to increase annual sugar production to 400,000 tons
by 1980 and to modernize export handling facilities. Part of this program
involves an increase in the annual capacity of the Lambasa mill on Vanua Levu
from 65,000 to 90,000 tons. The expansion is being funded by FSC and work
is proceeding on schedule with estimated completion by 1979. To utilize this
increased capacity, the Government and FSC initiated the settlement of about
800 farmers, half Indian and half Fijian, to produce 200,000 tons of sugar-
cane per year on 12,000 acres at Seaqaqa, about 25 miles west of Lambasa.
In addition to increasing sugar production, the objectives of the settlement
are to encourage Fijian participation in commercial agriculture, to raise in-
comes of the relatively poor settlers and to establish a viable community
based on the production of sugarcane at Seaqaqa. The lessons learned at
Seaqaqa would be applicable to future attempts to develop and increase the
productivity of other areas elsewhere in the country.
33.       Investigations have also shown that a further 200,000 tons of
sugarcane could be produced annually by reconstructing seawalls and improving
internal drainage on some 26,400 acres of low-lying coastal land. The areas
affected by poor drainage contain some of the potentially most productive
sugarcane land in Fiji, on which production has been falling in the last 10
or 15 years due to failure to maintain the water control structures. Drain-
age improvement is an obvious high priority investment which would yield
quick returns; failure to arrest the deterioration of these areas would re-
sult in continued declines in production. The proposed project would help
raise the incomes of farmers in these areas and at Seaqaqa to a level equiv-
alent to the incomes of the bulk of Fiji's coastal sugarcane farmers whose
lands are not affected by poor drainage.



-9-_
Description of the Project
34.       The proposed project would consist of two parts.     The first
would complete the ongoing settlement scheme at Seaqaqa and the second
would improve drainage on low-lying coastal sugarcane lands. Project
components would include:
(a) Seaqaga Settlement
(1) clearing of about 8,000 acres of land for planting
sugarcane;
(2) provision of housing material, land preparation,
inputs up to first harvest and first year subsist-
ence loans for about 400 new settlers;
(3) construction of a sugar tramline extension of about
6.5 miles from Wailevu to Tambia;
(4) construction and upgrading of about 17 miles of main
road from Tambia to Vunimako and construction of
about 117 miles of farm access roads;
(5)  sites and services for a new township at Seaqaqa;
(6)  construction of a road maintenance sub-depot at
the Seaqaqa township;
(7)  loans from FDB to individual settlers and NLDC for
the purchase of tractors, farm implements and
sugarcane transport vehicles; and
(8) procuremaent of road construction and maintenance
equipment.
(b) Drainage Improvement
(1)  reconstruction of about 22.5 miles of seawalls with
tidal gates;
(2)  improvements of internal drainage serving about
26,400 acres of sugarcane land;
(3)  photogrammetric mapping of the drainage areas on
Viti Levu; and
(4)  procurement of vehicles and construction of offices.
35.       The Seaqaqa settlement was begun in 1974.     To date 400 families
have been settled and 4,000 acres of land already cleared. Upon completion
of the proposed projeci:, about 800 families would be settled in the area
and about 12,000 acres of land brought under cultivation.



- 10 -
36.       All land in the project area is native land.    Settlers are each
being given NLTB agricultural leases, and to encourage land improvement, NLTB
and the local mataqalis have agreed to a uniform 30-year term as an exception
to the normal practice of ten-year leases. Farm plots are being laid out with
an average size of 50 acres of land, but most farms will only have an arable
area of about 25 acres because of the hilly terrain in the Seaqaqa area. Rent
payable to the Mataqalis through NLTB is set initially at F$7.50/acre of sugar-
cane and F$0.50/acre for other land, subject to reassessment after five years.
Each of the 800 settlers would cultivate 15 acres of sugarcane under contract
with FSC. The 10 acres of arable reserve would be available for future devel-
opment for sugarcane, subject to milling capacity, or for other crops which
might prove to be technically feasible and commercially viable.
37.       The drainage improvement areas include 20,100 acres, or 20 percent
of the total sugarcane land in the Lautoka, Rarawai and Penang mill areas of
Viti Levu, and about 6,300 acres, or 10 percent of the total cane acreage in
the Lambasa mill area of Vanua Levu. These areas are close to major towns and
ate served by a good road system and by FSC's sugar tramline system.
Cost Estimates and Financing
38.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $26 million, of which
$12 million (about 46 percent) would be in foreign exchange. The estimates
include physical contingencies of 10 percent for the Seaqaqa Settlement and
20 percent for the drainage improvements. Price contingencies amounting to
about 20 percent of total project costs have been provided to allow for the
expected rate of international and domestic inflation.
39.       The proposed Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange cost of
the project. The Government would relend $6 million of the proceeds of
the Bank loan to FDB on the same terms as the Bank loan under the terms of
a subsidiary loan agreement to be entered into before the effectiveness of
the Bank loan (Sections 3.01 (c) and 5.01 of the Loan Agreement). Under the
terms of this agreement, the Government would assume the foreign exchange
risk. FDB would lend the $6 million together with $6 million from its own
resources to individuals for land clearing, first year farm development and
subsistence;to individuals and to the Native Land Development Corporation
(NLDC), a subsidiary of NLTB, for purchase of tractors, farm equipment and
cane transport vehicles; to NLDC for development of the Seaqaqa township; to
FSC for the tramline earthworks and to Drainage Boards for internal drainage
improvement. The Government would use the balance of the Bank loan ($6
million) and $7.3 from its budgetary resources to finance roads at Seaqaqa,
seawalls and tidal gates. FSC would provide $0.7 million from its own re-
sources to finance the local cost of the tramline extension.
40.       FDB, an independent statutory authority, wholly owned by the Gov-
ernment, would have an important role in financing the project. It was es-
tablished in 1967 to promote agricultural and industrial development in Fiji
within the framework of the Government's general economic plans, policies
and priorities. FDB's main source of funds is the Government. It has also



- 11 -
been able to borrow from various local institutions and $2 million from the
Asian Development Bank in 1973.
41.       In May 1974, the Government decided to subsidize certain agricul-
tural loans in order to stimulate agricultural development and help redress
urban-rural income imbalance. Eligible farmers pay an interest rate of
4 to 6 percent and the Government pays the difference between the farmer's
rate and FDB's current lending rate of 10 percent. As a result, the propor-
tion of FDB's lending to agriculture has increased substantially. Sea-
qaqa settlers, in common with other sugarcane farmers, would be eligible
for FDB loans for land clearing and first year development and subsistence
which would have an interest rate of 4 percent per annum; FDB's loans for
purchase of tractors would be at 6 percent.   All of FDB's other loans under
the project would have an annual interest rate of 10 percent.
Organization and Management
42.       A number of existing agencies and departments in Fiji would be in-
volved in the implementation of this project. These include the Public Works
Department (PWD), NLD(', NLTB, FDB, the Drainage and Irrigation Division (DID)
of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forests (MAFF), local Drainage
Boards and the Ministry of Fijian Affairs and Rural Development. The two
parts of the project the Seaqaqa Settlement and the drainage improvement, would
be carried out independently under the overall guidance and responsibility
of the Permanent Secretary of MAFF.
(a) The Seagaga Settlement
43.       For the Seacqaqa settlement, the Permanent Secretary of MAFF would
be the chairman of a central coordinating committee, consisting of the
national level represEntatives of the various agencies involved in project
implementation, which would be responsible for policy in the Seaqaqa area.
The Permanent Secretary would appoint a project manager for the Seaqaqa
settlement who would report to him and be responsible for the day-to-day
activities under the project. The Project Manager would have two principal
assistants, a Cane Development Officer and an Agricultural Officer for other
subsistence and commercial crops (Section 3.07 of the Loan Agreement). The
Cane Development Officer would control the extension staff, set up and manage
farm accounts and organize the harvest and transport of cane. He would also
direct a Land Clearance Unit, which would carry out all land clearing under
contract. A local consulting firm, employed by FSC, would be attached to
the Land Clearance Unit to prepare tender documents, supervise the work and
prepare monthly progress certificates. The Project Manager would award all
contracts. He would also coordinate other activities such as road construc-
tion, provision of health and education services and land surveys through
a local coordinating committee consisting of the divisional level represen-
tatives of the various agencies. The local committee would be chaired by the
Commissioner of the Northern Division of Fiji and would also include the
provincial executive officer and representatives of the local mataqalis.
44.       PWD would be responsible for project roads.    Road construction
would be carried out by a construction unit of PWD stationed at Seaqaqa,



- 12 -
which would be adequately staffed and would be headed by a qualified and ex-
perienced road engineer (Section 3.08 of the Loan Agreement). FSC is res-
ponsible for the construction of the tramline extension which began in
September 1975.
45.       One of the objectives of the Seaqaqa settlement is to involve
native Fijians more actively in sugarcane and other commercial agricultural
activities. To this end, NLDC would operate 37 of the 400 farms allocated
to Fijians in one block as a nucleus estate covering about 1,600 acres.
NLDC would also operate a tractor hiring and cane transport business at
Seaqaqa, with a maintenance workshop, and would develop the new Seaqaqa
township. NLDC's main objectives would be to train Fijians as cane farmers
on the estate; to develop the most profitable field operational techniques
applicable to smallholder cane farmers; to train Fijians to operate tractors
and cane transport equipment so that they can play their full part in the
settlement either as NLDC employees or as independent operators; and, to pro-
vide economic and social services for the farming community through the dev-
opment of the Seaqaqa township.
46.       NLDC would have the power to take over and maintain under its
estate management the farms of any settlers who fail as smallholders, until
they or their successors are adequately trained on the estate. NLDC would
consult with the Bank before undertaking any major expansion of the area
under its estate management through the takeover of unsuccessful farms, or
before distributing a substantial part of the existing estate to individual
smallholders (Section 3.06 of the Loan Agreement).
(b) Drainage Improvement
47.       The Principal Engineer for Drainage and Irrigation would be in
charge of project implementation with the Permanent Secretary having overall
responsibility for this component of the project. To meet its increased
responsibilities under the Project, DID has set up two regional offices
in the Northern and Western Divisions of Fiji. These would each be headed
by a Divisional Engineer and would be adequately staffed. The positions
of Divisional Engineers are now vacant, but would be filled before any
contract work for drainage improvement begins (Section 3.09 of the Loan
Agreement).
(c) Agricultural Supporting Services
48.       FSC is responsible for sugarcane research in Fiji.    It has a well
organized experiment station at Lautoka on the island of Viti Levu and has
recently established a small research station at Seaqaqa to concentrate
on developing input recommendations and cane farming techniques specifically
adapted to the settlement area. The Department of Agriculture of MAFF is
responsible for research on crops other than sugarcane and at present runs
a research station in Seaqaqa. FSC with the assistance of staff seconded
from MAFF would provide extension services to farmers in the project area
(Section 4.04 of the Loan Agreement). FDB would provide credit for farm



- 13 -
implements and first year farm development costs and subsistence at Seaqaqa.
FSC would also provide annual production credit as is the normal practice
throughout the Fiji sugar industry.
49.       The Economics, Planning and Statistics Division of MAFF, which
reports directly to the Permanent Secretary, would monitor progress of the
project with respect to deployment of farm advisors, pace of land clearing
and farm development, progress of drainage improvement, growth in yield
and farm incomes, loan repayment and drainage rate recovery.
Procurement
50.       To maintain the project's momentum and ensure that cane transport
does not become a bottleneck to the realization of project benefits, a con-
tract for the tramline extension earthworks ($0.8 million) was awarded in
September 1975 after international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank Guidelines and the work is now in progress. FSC staff would construct
bridges and install the rails using materials already on hand.
51.       Civil works for land clearing ($1.7 million), seawall reconstruc-
tion and internal drainage improvements ($4.5 million), and for Seaqaqa
township development wDuld be carried out under contracts awarded after com-
petitive bidding in accordance with local procedures, which are acceptable.
Contracts for land clearing would be unlikely to exceed $100,000 each.
The largest contracts for seawalls and internal drainage would be about
$400,000 while most such contracts would be around $100,000. The small,
scattered nature of thesse works makes them unsuitable for international
competitive bidding. There is adequate competition and foreign firms would be
eligible to participate in the bidding.
52.       Civil works for the roads at Seaqaqa ($5.4 million) and water and
electricity supply in the Seaqaqa township would be carried out through
force account by the PWD, which does all similar work in Fiji. The small
amount of main road construction and improvement and the scattered nature
of the farm access roads makes them unsuitable for international competitive
bidding. In addition, past experience with international competitive bidding
in Fiji has shown that foreign bids have been considerably higher than the
cost of PWD force account work, due to the size and location of the country
and the difficulty of mobilization. It is expected that the local contrac-
ting industry would be fully extended with land clearing, seawall reconstruc-
tion and internal drainage improvements under the project, as well as other
ongoing development work in Fiji, and would therefore be incapable of carry-
ing out the road works on time.
53.       Equipment for construction and maintenance of roads at Seaqaqa
($1.8 million) and for water and electricity supply for the Seaqaqa township
would be procured after local shopping in accordance with local procedures,
which have been reviewed by Bank staff and are acceptable. International
competitive bidding for such equipment would not be warranted because of
the small number and diversity of items involved, the desirability of
standardization with existing equipment and the advantage of existing
servicing arrangements with local suppliers.



- 14 -
54.       Tractors, farm implements ($0.6 million) and other equipment for
use in the Seaqaqa settlement area would be purchased after local shopping
by borrowers with credit to be advanced by FDB. There are enough local
suppliers to ensure adequate competition and after-sales service. About
thirteen cane transport vehicles ($0.9 million) would be provided under
the project. Three ($0.2 million) have been specifically designed (six-axle
semi-trailers) to suit conditions at Seaqaqa. These would be procured direct-
ly from the supplier. Experience with these semi-trailers would be reviewed
by the Government and the Bank's staff in September 1976 to determine the suit-
ability of the equipment, the responsibility for operation and maintenance of
a fleet of such vehicles and the procurement procedures for the remaining
ten such vehicles. The photogrammetric mapping ($0.1 million), which will
not be financed through the proceeds of the proposed loan, would be carried
out by the Lands Department.
Disbursements
55.       The proposed loan would be disbursed for 100 percent of the for-
eign exchange cost of directly imported equipment and vehicles, 70 percent
of total cost for imported equipment procured locally and 45 percent of the
total cost of civil works. Since the Seaqaqa settlement is an ongoing pro-
ject, retroactive financing for expenditures on tramline earthworks incurred
after September 1, 1975, and for expenditures on other civil works and equip-
ment incurred after January 1, 1976, is proposed. Retroactive financing
required is not expected to exceed about $550,000, including $350,000 for
tramline earthworks.
Recovery of Costs
56.       For the Seaqaqa settlement, the main road would be part of the
national highway system and all users including the settlers and township
residents would be subject to Fiji's normal road user charges. The cost
of the tramline extension would be borne by FSC from its share of sugar
sales. The cost of tractors and cane transport vehicles would be fully
recovered from individual purchasers and NLDC through repayment of subloans.
The cost of township development would be borne by NLDC, which would operate
as a commercial developer and would recover its full investment costs from
township residents.
57.       Settlers would repay FDB directly for the full cost of land clear-
ing and first year farm development over a maximum of ten years, including a
three year grace period with interest at 4 percent per annum. FSC would
collect the repayments for FDB as a deduction from sugarcane proceeds. The
charges would account for about 34 percent of settlers' incremental cash
income and over the repayment period of the sub-loans would recover about 53
percent of land clearing and farm development cost in Seaqaqa, at an assumed
interest rate of 10 percent. Indirectly, beneficiaries would repay part of the
cost of access road construction and maintenance through user charges in the
form of tractor license fees and fuel taxes.



- 15 -
58.       For the drainage improvement part of the project, the Government
proposes to reconstruct seawalls as a national expenditure which would not
be recovered from beneficiaries. Farmers would repay the full cost of con-
struction of internal common user drains over ten years at 10 perccent in-
terest and the operation and maintenance cost of seawalls and drains through
an annual drainage rat:e. Depending on whether farms are initially affected
by saltwater intrusion as well as by restricted internal drainage, these
charges would represernt about 25 to 45 percent of the farmers' incremental
cash income. Assuming an interest rate of 10 percent, the beneficiaries would
repay about 78 percent: of the costs of internal drainage. The Drainage Boards
would be empowered to levy drainage rates in the project areas sufficient to
recover the full construction cost of common user drains over ten years at
FDB's normal interest rate, plus the full cost of .operating and maintaining
seawalls and drains (Section 4.05 of the Loan Agreement).
59.       The proposecL charges for both the settlement and drainage improve-
ment areas represent a reasonable contribution to project costs and would
be within the beneficiaries' ability to pay.
Project Benefits
60.       At full development, annual incremental sugarcane production from
the project is expected to be 330,000 tons. Resulting raw sugar exports
of 41,000 tons would earn about $13 million a year in foreign exchange.
In 1985, according to the Bank's commodity price forecasts, the fob price
per ton of sugar is expected to be about $314, declining from $446 in 1975.
The project would benefit some 3,400 sugarcane farmers and their families,
or 17,000 people, plus 500 new township residents. It would create 3,500
agricultural jobs during the six-month crushing season and 700 jobs during
the slack season. Anr,ual per capita incomes in the settlement area would
increase from about $200 at present to $800 after repayment of project loans,
which would be approximately equivalent to the national GDP per capita which
is expected to be about $870 at that time (1985). Per capita incomes of
farmers affected by pcor drainage would increase from their present level
of around $550 to about $870 as a result of the improvement under the project.
In addition, the Seaqaqa component of the project would also assist the
Government in its effcrts to develop suitable orgranizational arrangements
for carrying out similar settlement projects elsewhere in Fiji designed
to utilize presently unproductive land and to raise incomes of low income
people.
61.       The economic rate of return for the total project, and for both
the Seaqaqa setlement and the drainage iprovement considered separately,
would be 20 percent. In the settlement part, the cost of the tramline
extension, the township development and half of the main road improvements
have been excluded, since they would generate separate benefits other than
those from increased sugarcane production. If the full costs of these
items are included and benefits remain unchanged, the rate of return would
be 12 percent. The rates of return show moderate sensitivity to cost
overruns or the assumptions made concerning the level and timing of agri-
cultural benefits. If project costs increase by 20 percent and benefits



- 16 -
drop by 25 percent, the rate of return on each part of the project would
still exceed 13 percent.
Environmental Effect
62.       A potential environmental hazard from the project is soil erosion
in the Seaqaqa settlement area due to a combination of erodible soils, rain-
fall and irregular topography. However, the Government and agencies involved
in the scheme are aware of the problems and are taking adequate measures
to avoid excessive soil erosion, including the establishment of proper soil
erosion control standards and strict enforcement of legal restrictions
designed to curtail improper land use.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
63.       The draft Loan Agreement between Fiji and the Bank, the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a draft resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
Features of particular interest are referred to in paragraphs 29, 39, 43,
44, 46, 47, 48, 55 and 58.
64.       The proposed loan will not become effective until the subsidiary
Loan Agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, has been concluded between the
Government and FDB (Section 5.01 of the Loan Agreement).
65.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
66.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 771-FIJ           First Highway Project:   $11.8 million loan of
June 30, 1971 and $4.2 million supplementary loan
of February 1, 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1977; Effectiveness Dates: September 24, 1971
and March 5, 1973
The first Bank project in Fiji provided financing for detailed
engineering by consultants of the 110-mile Nadi-Suva road in three sections:
No. 1:  Nadi-Korotongo (41 m), No. 2:   Korotongo-Deumba and (43 m), No. 3:
Deumba-Suva (26 km); construction of Sections Nos. 1 and 3; and supervision
of construction by consultants.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress in execution, and in particular to report any problems which are
being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They should
be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not pur-
port to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 2
The total estimated cost of the project at the time the original
loan was made on June 30, 1971 was $16.6 million of which $11.8 million
was provided by the Bank loan. The estimated construction cost of the
project was revised substantially upward following the results of re-bidding
the project works. Revised project costs were estimated at $31.8 million
and the original loan was increased to $16 million on February 1, 1973.
In addition, Australia and New Zealand agreed to contribute $2.7 and $1.8
million, respectively, to help meet higher project costs. Execution of the
project, payments by the Government to the contractor and supervision by the
consultants are generally satisfactory. It is likely that the works will
require an extra six months to complete,but will be finished by the Closing
Date (December 31, 1977).
Loan No. 833-FIJ                First Telecommunications project:   $2.2 mil-
lion Loan of June 23, 1972; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977; Effectiveness Date:
September 28, 1972
The project supports the Department of Posts and Telecommunications'
(P&T) 1971-75 development program. After initial delays, resulting mainly
from the hurricane in October 1972 with its damage to existing telecommunica-
tions, the project is now proceeding satisfactorily. Procurement and dis-
bursement have picked up substantially and the loan is expected to be fully
disbursed by mid-1976.
The financial covenants in the Loan Agreement are being met. Con-
siderable progress has been made toward reorganizating P&T's financial pro-
cedures and establishing the new commercial accounting system. Satisfactory
training arrangements have been established. P&T's financial position is
sound and operating results are exceeding forecasts.
Loan No. 1140-FIJ               Second Telecommunications project:   US$5.0 mil-
lion Loan of July 16, 1975; Closing Date:
March 31, 1980; Effectiveness Date: October 23,
1975
The project supports the first three years (1976-78) of P & T's five-
year development program (1976-1980). The progress of the project is satis-
factory.

FIJI: SUGAR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:              Fiji
Amount:                $12 million equivalent
Terms:                 The loan would have a term of 20 years, including
5 years of grace with interest at 8.5 percent
per annum.
Beneficiaries:         The Government would pass $6 million of the proceeds
of the Loan to the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) for
relending to individuals in the Seaqaqa settlement
area for land clearing, first year farm development
and subsistance;to individuals and the Native Land
Development Corporation (NLDC) for purchase of tractors,
farm equipment and cane transport vehicles; to NLDC for
the development of Seaqaqa township; to FSC for the
tramline earth works; and to Drainage Boards for in-
ternal drainage improvements. The remaining $6 million
of the proposed loan would be used by the Government to
help finance the construction and improvement of roads,
seawalls and tidal gates. About 3,400 sugarcane farmers
and their families, plus an expected 500 Seaqaqa town-
ship residents would directly benefit from the project.
Relending terms:       The $6 million of the proceeds of the proposed loan
would be passed to FDB on same terms as those of the
Bank loan. FDB's relending to the ultimate bor-
rowers would have varying terms depending on the
purpose for which the funds are borrowed. FDB's
loans for land clearing and preparation, roofing
sheets, inputs up to first harvest and first year
subsistance allowance would be at 4 percent and
for tractors at 6 percent. The difference
between these rates and the normal FDB rate of
10 percent would be paid to FDB by the Government.
FDB's other loans would have an interest rate of
10 percent.
