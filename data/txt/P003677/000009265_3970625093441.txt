PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
The Loan. USS12.0 million, was approved by the Board on March 23,
1976, signed on April 23, 1976, and became effective on July 13, 1976.  The
original Closing Date was expected to be December 31, 1981, but was ultimately
extended to December 31, 1983. The final disbursement was made on July 27,
1984 and on August 1, 1984 an undisbursed amount of US$256,728.25 was
cancelled.
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Bank's East Asia
and Pacific Regional Office. The doctment is based on a comprehensive project
completion report submitted to the Bank by the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries (MAF) in June 1984. This included detailed reports by the project
manager of the Seqaqa settlement and by the Drainage and Irrigation Division
(DID) in MAF, as well as related project materials from other participating
agencies. An excellent summary was also provided by MAP. These documents are
available in the project file.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower on March 28, 1985.
Comments received from the Fijian Ministry of Communications, Transport and
Works, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Primary Industry, and the Fiji Sugar
Corporation are in Annexes C, D, E and F, respectively.
This project has not been audited by OED.

SUGAR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (Loan 1226-FIJ)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
i.        In 1976 the World Bank made its first loan in agriculture to Fiji
for a Sugar Development Project (Ln. 1226-FIJ). The project was intended to
expand cane production and increase native Fijian participation in commercial
agricuLture. The project included two components: (i) settlement of 400
famiLies in Seaqaqa, an ongoing sugar production scheme in Fiii's Northern
Division; and (ii) seawaLl and drainage improvement in low lying cane areas in
the Northern and Western Divisions. The oroject was implemented by the
Ministry of AgricuLture and Fisheries (MAF) in cooperation wich the Fiji Sugar
Corporation (FSC) and the Fiji Development Bank (FDB).
ii.       The project has been verv successful.  TotaL cane production in
Seaqaqa exceeded Government targets of 200,000 tons by 1979 and rose to
316,000 tons in 1982, while production in drainage areas increased
threefold. In 1982, the peak production year, a total of 765,000 tons of
sugarcane were produced in project areas, 22% of Fiji's total cane
production. Yields in Seaqaqa approximate Fiji averages and demonstrate the
possibility of maintaining agricultural production on ferruginous latosols
with adequate inputs and appropriate soil management techniques. This success
is due largely to strong support by Government, MAF, and FSC.
iii.      The project has also met its social objectives.  A cotal of 800
famiLies were settled, sLightly over 50% native Fijians, and of the 174
families producing more than 500 tons of cane per farm in the peak production
year of 1982, nearly one-third were native Fijians. Within the native Fijian
group, however, resettled Fijians have generally performed better than local
famiLies who have retained strong ties to their communities, and a task force
has been formed to help 72 families who have low incomes and debt service
probLems. The SAR envisioned that the Native Land Development Corporation
(NLDC) would develop an estate in order to support native Fijian participation
in the project, but the estate has not served the project's social objectives.
iv.       Project appraisal took place during a period when managerial control
was being transferred from expatriate advisors to Fijian nationals and there
was some uncertainty about local managerial capacity. The success of the
project indicates, however, that the major implementing agencies, MAF, FSC and
FDB, performed very well, in spite of the fact that the project itself pro-
vided little direct institutional support. This success was not without
costs, and FSC, in particular, allocated more financial and managerial
resources to the project than originally anticipated.



- vi. -
v.        The cost of the project is now estimated at about US$35.9 million in
comparison with appraisal estimates of US$26 million. This is due, in part,
to high FSC overheads in Seaqaqa (US$4.7 million) which were not taken into
account in appraisal projections. The project also constructed more seawalls
and tidal gates than anticipated at appraisal, and delays in the implementa-
tion of the drainage component added to project cc-s. In spite of this, post
project economic analysis shows an ERR of 10-12% for the Seaqaqa settlement,
depending on assumptions used, and of 36-50% in the drainage schemes. High
ERRs are not unusual in rehabilitation schemes where previous work is regarded
as a sunk cost. An ERR of 20% was projected for each component at appraisal.
vi.       The major implementation problems in the project have been in cane
transport and the organization of cane harvesting. In retrospect, cane
harvesting and transport were beyond the managerial capacicy of inexperienced
cane farmers and/or NLDC and should have been carried out under direct FSC
contract with associated overheads treated as projec: costs. In addition, the
original smallholder repayment assumptions. which provided no incentive for
production, were changed early in the project. Problems were also encountered
with road maintenance and township development. Slow implementation of the
drainage component has been attributed to staff shortages, delays in
photogrammetric mapping, problems in securing farmer's permission to undertake
work which would increase drainage rates, and cycLone damage when works were
nearly complete.
vii.      The major Lessons from the project are that:
(a)  cane production on low fertility soils is possible with good
management and high fertilizer inputs (para. 3.03);
(b)  traditional Fijian farmers living outside their home communities can
perform weLl in commercial agriculturewhen given adequate financial
incentives and financial support (para. 3.06); and
(c)  problems of cane harvesting and cane transport have been the result
of the inappropriate organizational assumptions (para. 4.07).
viii.     The projecc has been very successful, but might have been improved
by more detailed analysis of social and institutional factors and components
to strengthen implementing institutions.
ix.       The following points may be of particular interest:
-    improved alignment and good surfacing of the project's main road has
resulted in increased traffic beyond appraisal expectations thus
creating serious maintenance problems (para. 4.11);
-    township development, on the other hand, has lagged behind appraisal
expectations largely because of slow development of basic amenities
(para. 4.12); and
-    lack of basic mapping and experienced staff resulted in significant
delays in the drainage component. This was aggravated by the impact
of a cyclone in 1983 on already completed drainage works (para.
4.13).



FIJI
SUGAR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (Loan 1226-FIJ)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
Project Objectives
1.01      Sugar is Fiji's Largest industry.  At appraisal (1975), sugar con-
tributed 10Z of GNP and 70% of export earnings. It was the country's largest
employer and cane occupied about 37% of all productive Land. In spite of the
importance of cane to the economy, cane production had stagnated and was
beginning to decline at the time of project identification. This was due, in
part, to the sale of South Pacific Sugar Mills (SPSM) to the newly independent
Fijian government, and to a lack of investment in the industry prior to
independence.
1.02      In preparing its second development plan after independence (DP7,
1976-1981), the Government of Fiji placed priority on agriculture and empha-
sized the need to improve the attractiveness of agricultural occupations and
increase the participation of native Fijians in commercial agriculture in
order to increase incomes and stem rural-urban migration. Sugar was expected
to play a dominant role in reaLizing these objectives and major investments
were planned in DP7 to expand cane production and milling capacity, and to
modernize export handling facilities.
Project Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
1.03      This project was identified in May 1974 and was originally
envisioned as an irrigation and drainage project to promote both sugar and
rice production. A Bank mission in September 1974 determined that bilateral
aid was available for rice development and it identified the major components
of a Sugar Development Project. These included: expanding cane production at
an ongoing resettlement area in Seaqaqa (Northern Division), constructing a
sugar tramline to Seaqaqa, constructing bulk handling facilities for sugar at
Labasa (near the mill receiving Seaqaqa cane) and improving drainage on low
lying land located in the Northern and Western Divisions. The estimated cost
of the project was F$22 m including F$10 m of foreign exchange.
1.04      The FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program (FAO/CP) prepared a project in
February/March 1975, including three "sub-projects" (Seaqaqa settlement,
Labasa bulk-handling, and drainage development) along the general lines sug-
gested by the Bank, but it excluded tramline development on the grounds it was
uneconomic. Government subsequently indicated a strong preference for con-
structing bulk handling facilities at Lautoka, rather than Labasa, and for
extending the existing tramline into Seaqaqa. After discussion with govern-
ment officials, the Bank excluded all bulk handling from the project, as funds
for this purpose were avaiLable from other sources, and they agreed to hire a
consultant to review transport questions.



1.05      The project was appraised in July/August 1975 and contained two
components: ti) Seaqaqa resettlement; and (ii) seawall and drainage improve-
ment. During appraisal ic was agreed that the tramline wo'.ld be extended
10 km to Tabia, located in the foothills of the Seaqaqa plateau, and that it
would be linked to the project area by a 27 km road. At the issues meeting,
the Bank agreed to increase the loan size to cover all foreign exchange costs
and to permit retro.ctive financing and advance contracting.  The meeting also
recommended that the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) increase its interest rates
to the farmers from 4% for farm development and 6Z for agricultural equipment
to a uniform 10Z in order to eliminate the need for interest rate subsidies
from GOF. Government rejected this recommendation because Seaqaqa was an
ongoing scheme and new settlers would be disadvantaged in relation to the
older ones if terms were changed, and because Government wished to take steps
to make agriculture more attractive to the rural population. This position
was accepted by the Bank.
II. THE PROJECT
Project Components
2.01      Seagaga Settlement.  The Seaqaqa settlement area consists of about
16,000 ha on a plateau 40 km west of Labasa, the provinciaL capital and site
of the sugar mill. The area is rolling and hilly and only about 50% is suit-
able for cultivation. Red latosolic clays in the area are heavily leached and
need careful management and heavy fertilizer application. At the time of
appraisal, access to the area was limited. All land in Seaqaqa was native
land administered by the Native Land Trust Board (NLTB). To encourage invest-
ment by settlers, all land was leased from the native landowners for 30 years.
2.02      The Seaqaqa settlement scheme, begun in 1974, was intended to
produce about 200,000 tons of sugarcane annually and settle about 800 families
on 40 acre (16 ha) farms of which about 15 acres (6 ha) were to be cleared for
sugarcane. At appraisal about 400 families had been settled and 1,620 ha had
been cLeared and planted to cane. Under the project 400 additional families
were to be settled and a further 3,240 ha developed. About 50% of settlers
were to be native Fijians. The Seaqaqa component also included:
(a)  provision of housing materials, land preparation inputs to first
harvest, and first year's subsistence for about 400 settlers;
(b)  construction of a 10 km sugar tramline;
(c)  construction and upgrading of about 27 km of main roads from the
tramline terminus to the project area;
(d)  construction of about 185 km of farm access roads;
(e)  provision of sites and services for a new township at Seaqaqa;
(f)  construction of a road maintenance depot;
(g)  loans from FDB for the purchase of tractors, farm implements and
sugarcane transport vehicles; and



-3-
{h) procurement of road construction and road maintenance equipment.
Project works were to be completed in five years.
2.03      Drainage Component.  Two types of areas were affected by poor
drainage. The first was an area of about 4,500 ha affected by salt water
intrusion and water logging as a result of the deterioration of protective
seawalls and tidal gates.  Within this area about 1,400 ha had gone entirely
out of production. The second was an area of 7,000 ha in which production had
declined as a resuLt of water logging caused by siltation and deterioration of
internal drainage schemes. This area included about 1,000 ha of former sugar-
cane land. To address these probLems, the project proposed:
(a) reconstruction of 36.5 km of seawalls with tidaL gates;
(b) improvement of internal drains serving about 10,600 ha of sugarcane
land;
(c) phocogrammetric mapping of the drainage areas on Viti Levu; and
(d) procurement of vehicles and construction of offices.
These works were also to be completed in five years.
Organization and Management
2.04      General.  Under the project, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry
of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) was given the responsibility for project
execution and served as the Chairman of a coordinating committee consisting of
all implementing agencies. Responsibility for carrying out the settlement
component was vested in an experienced Project Manager from FSC who was
appointed by MAF. Road construction in the settlement areas was carried out
on force account by the Public Works Department (PWD). Drainage works were
carried out by the Division of Irrigation and Drainage (DID), within MAF, in
conjunction with Local Drainage Boards. Project benefits were to be monitored
by the newly established Economic Planning and Statistics Unit within HAF.
2.05      Seaqaqa.  In the settlement area, Land development (including
initial cane establishment) was carried out by FSC under the authority of the
project manager. The initiaL cost of Land development, cane establishment,
and the provision of both housing materials and subsistence supplies for the
first year were covered by a loan from FDB which was assumed by the small-
holders upon entering the project. Thereafter, FSC was to provide farmers
with seed cane, fertilizer, and cash advances for the cost of harvesting and
transport. This amount was to be deducted at the factory as a first charge
against the growers share of sugar proceeds. Replanting was assumed after
three ratoons with funds and services advanced by FSC and recovered from cane
payments.
2.06      Mindful of the fact that Seaqaqa was a new settlement consisting of
inexperienced cane growers, the project contained two provisions to support



-4 -
smallholder agricultural development. First, an assurance was sought that MAF
would provide one farm advisor for each 100 settLer families; and second, the
project sought to use the National Land Development Corporation (NLDC), a
commercial subsidiary of NLTB, to support Fijian participation in the
project.  To this end, the project empowered NLDC to:
(a) operate 37 of the 400 farms allocated to Fijians as a nucleus estate
for demonstration purposes;
(b) take over and maintain, under estate management, the farms of any
settlers who failed as smalLholders, until they or their successors
were adequately trained;
(c) own and operate up to half the tractors and transport vehicLes in
ihe project and train native Fijians in their use; and
(d) operate a garage, service station and workshop to maintain and
repair this equipment.
NLDC was also intended to establish a new township in Seaqaqa.
2.07      Drainage Works.  The principal engineer of DID was given the overall
responsibility for drainage improvement and divisional engineers were
responsible for work within their areas. DID divisional offices financed
seawall construction from their budgets and acted as agents of the local
Drainage Boards for the construction of internal drains and for their
operation and maintenance. Funds for these services were to be borrowed from
FDB by the Drainage Boards with the consent of their memoers. Drainage Boards
were legally empowered to levy drainage rates for expenditures, and these
drainage rates plus the farmers debt service were to be deducted at the
factory by FSC as a second charge against cane payments.
III. PROJECT EVALUATION
General Assessment
3.01      Overview.  The Seaqaqa settlement scheme was largely completed
within the five-year project period and is a source of pride to the Fiji
government. In total, about 800 families were settle-d and 4,700 ha were
cleared and planted to cane. FSC completed the 10 km tramline extension and
PWD completed 27 km of main roads and 200 km of farm access roads which opened
the area to new economic activity.  Land was surveyed and allocated for the
township although development has lagged (para. 4.11). As a result of
investment under the project an isolated area was opened to development and
economic activity has been simulated throughout the region.
3.02      Drainage works were also completed satisfactorily although this
component delayed project completion by nearly three years. Altogether DID
reconstructed 59 km of seawalls, and it cleared and re-excavated 688 km of
main drains and 1,377 km of secondary drains which were no longer effective.
On-farm drains totaling 1,456 km were excavated and maintained by the farmers.



-5-
Under the project about 3,340 ha were protected from inundation and another
6,225 ha benefitted by drainage improvement. Non-quantified benefits in
drainage areas include improved access and communication and protection of
property during storms and high Eides.
3.03      Production Objectives.  The project has been very successful in
meeting its production objectives. The SAR projected that Seaqaqa production
would rise to about 170,000 tons by 1980, on the land cleared by the project,
and would level off at about 130.000 tons annually by 1983 as a result of
declining soil fertility. Direct comparisons are difficuLt, as SAR assump-
tions exclude yields from Land cleared prior to 1976, however, if area is held
constant, production has averaged about 1.2 times appraisaL estimates. Total
production in Seaqaqa exceeded 240,000 tons by 1979 and rose to about 320,000
tons in the peak production year of 1982. in 1983. yields declined to about
200,000 tons due to a severe drought, but 1984 yields are exDected to reach
1982 levels. Based on farmer yields to date, future production is estimated
at 400,000 tons annually for Seaqaqa as a whole, twice the original government
target.
3.04      Production in drainage areas included within the project have
increased threefold, rising from about 144,000 tons in 1975 and 1976, to
450,000 tons in the peak year of 1982. (Yields in 1983 declined to about
290,000 tons). This amounts to an incremental increase of 200-300,000 tons in
1982, depending on assumptions used in the without-project case (Annex B,
Table 1). In total, areas covered under the project produced nearly 765,000
tons of cane in 1982 and 487,000 tons in 1983, one-fifth of the cane produced
in Fiji in those years.
3.05      Social Objectives.  At appraisal vircually all cane farming in Fiji
was carried out by Fijians who were the descendants of indentured laborers
brought from India to work on cane plantations. Most indigenous Fijian
farmers were involved in traditional cultivation, mainly fo- subsistence, and
there was considerable uncertainty atout the wiLlingness and ability of native
Fijians to manage commercial cane farming. From this standpoint, the project
has had significant success in meeting its primary social objective. Somewhat
over half of all lots were allocated to native Fijians and of the 174 families
producing more than 500 tons of cane per farm in the peak production year of
1982, nearly one-third were native Fijians. These families would have
realized a gross income of at least F$6,000, before deductions for FDB loans
which averaged F$1,200 annually. The median native Fijian farm in that year
produced about 300 tons of cane for gross family incomes of about F$3,000 from
sugarcane.  On the other hand, about 25Z of all native Fijian families and 10%
of Indo-Fijian families produced less than 200 tons of cane in 1982 and this
figure climbed to 57% of native Fijian and 35% of families of Indian descent
in the drought year of 1983. These families have had difficuLty meeting
subsistence needs and debt service payments. This is confirmed by small but
increasing arrears to FDB. Over the course of the project about 40 farms have
changed hands with the consent of the FDB.
3.06      Of interest is the fact that resettled native Fijian farmers have
done better than those from local communities. Of the 72 families in a task
force to help weak farmers, 62 are native Fijians. Among the native Fijians,



- 6 -
however, most are local farmers, aLthough settlers from the Eastern Islands
make up nearLy half the native Fijian smallholders. Reports from the field
indicate that local farmers suffer from two constraints. First, because of
their proximity to their villages and the extent of their communal obliga-
tions, local settlers spend considerable time away from their fields. Second,
because of their increased earning ability and status, they are subject to
financial demands from their communities, and pressures to share their incomes
negate the economic incentives for increasing production. This suggests that
major production and income increases may be difficult to attain within
villages with strong communal redistribution systems, but that indigenous
Fijians who no longer live in their natal communities can respond to economic
incentives if they have access to land and strong institutional support.
3.07      Institutional Impact.  In the mid-1970s managerial control of Fijian
institutions was being passed from expatriate advisors to Fijian nationals and
there was some uncertainey about local managerial capacity. As the success of
the project indicates, however, the major implementing agencies, MAF, FSC and
FDB, have functioned well, in spite of the fact that they received little
direct institutional support under the project. All three agencies responded
flexibly to project problems and interagency cooperation has been good. This
success has not been without its price, and it is clear that the project has
been costly to FSC, in particular, both in financiaL and managerial terms. If
further settlement were contemplated, it would be wise for Government to
examine actual costs in detail, but GOF officials are reluctant to undertake
this analysis since future production increases are expected on existing
fields.
3.08      Under the project an important roie was given to NLDC to promote
native Fijian participation in cane farming. However, NLDC had had little
experience in agriculture or in smallholder management, and in the course of
the project it encountered sufficient problems with its own estate that it
could not be of assistance to new farmers. In fact, although NLDC performance
has improved recently, the estate itself has been a drain on NLDC's financial
resources and at one point NLDC proposed to sell it to smallholders to
liquidate its debts. In retrospect, it is clear that NLDC was not prepared to
assume the role expected of it and that the estate itself would have bene-
fitted from direct support under the project.
Financial and Economic Analysis
3.09      Project Costs.  Actual project costs are now estimated at about
US$30 million without FSC overheads or US$35.9 million including FSC's project
related expenditures, in comparison with SAR projections of US$26 million.
The influence of inflation assumptions on these figures is negligible. The
main increase, as implied above, was in unrecovered FSC overheads which were
not included in appraisal estimates. These overheads were due largely to
problems in field management, cane harvesting and transport. The cost of land
clearing and farm development in Seaqaqa was about twice appraisal estimates;
seawall construction unit costs exceeded appraisal estimates by about twofold
and the length of seawalls constructed was 60% more than appraisal projec-
tions. In general, the Seaqaqa settlement cost about 30% more, and drainage
works 50% more, than projected costs. Regardless of these increased costs, an



- 7 -
undisbursed US$256,728.25 of the loan amount was cancelled after the loan was
closed. This was mainly due to delay in township development, for which only
50Z of available funds were disbursed and no reallocation of funds requested.
3.10      Economic Rate of Return.  Settlement and drainage components have
been analyzed separately using the following assumptions. In Seaqaqa the rate
of return has been run on the costs and benefits for all 800 families, not
only the 400 families settled under the project. This was necessary as land
was cleared for both old and new settlers, most project components benefitted
all settlers, and alL smallholder production figures are aggregated. As in
the SAR. the cost of the cownship, 50Z of the cost of the main road and 75Z of
the cost of the Labasa wharf road have been excluded as they have benefits not
accounted for under the project. However, uniike the SAR, the cost of tram-
Line development has been included in project costs as there are no other
intended beneficiaries. The costs of the NLDC development and its benefits
are not incLuded in the project, and where project works would have benefitted
NLDC (e.g. tramline) 6% of their costs, the equivalent to NLDC yields, are
deducted. Sugar prices take into account past and projected long-term
contracts with the EEC and other countries, which have absorbed the vast bulk
of Fiji Sugar to date.
3.11      Using these assumptions and a standard conversion factor of 1.0, as
is the current practice in Fiji, the economic rate of return for the Seaqaqa
settlement is 10Z, compared with an assumed rate of return of 202 at
appraisal. If government expenditures prior to the project are treated as
sunk costs, the rate of return is 12%. If foreign exchange is shadow priced,
as in the SAR, to reflect an assumed over-valuation of Fiji currency over the
life of the project, these rates would be 11% and 13% respectively. These
figures do not reflect significant non-quantified benefits including the
development of an isolated area and production increases in timber and in
commodities other than sugar.
3.12      In drainage areas, all pro,ect costs have been included and drainage
charges of FS1 per ton of cane sugar (the maximum drainage rate) have been
used as a proxy for operating costs. As it is difficult to determine without
project areas and yields, two methods of calculating incremental production
were considered. Under method A, it was assumed that yields in drainage areas
without the project would have increased at the same rate as in Fiji as a
whole. Under method B, it was assumed that yield increases due to new cane
varieties and better management would have been offset by declines due to
water logging and salt water intrusion (see Annex B, Table 1). If no shadow
pricing is used, the ERR under asumption A is 36% and under B 50%. While high
rates of return are not unusual for rehabilitation projects in which prior
expenditures are treated as sunk costs, these ERRs considerably exceed
appraisal estimates of 20%. This is due to the fact that total incremental
production is two times (method A) to three times (method B) higher than that
anticipated at appraisal. This, in turn, is due to expanded seawall construc-
tion which apparently resulted in an increase in cane production on land which
had previously gone out of production. In keeping with OPN 2.01, the more
c-nservative assumption is used in giving the rate of return for the project,
and no shadow pricing has been applied. NPV for the drainage component is
F$14 million at a 10% OCC.



IV. IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEMS
Cane Transport
4.01      The most serious problem in the project, in terms of its economic
ramifications, was the problem of cane transport. Elsewhere in Fiji, portable
rails are laid in the field and cane is loaded directly onto tram carts by the
harvesters. Loaded carts are pushed or carried to nearby shunts where they
are picked up by the tram and taken to the mill. Due to the rolling topogra-
phy of the Seaqaqa plateau and the high cost of estabLishing rail transport,
the appraisal mission rejected the FSC recommendation that an existing tram-
line be extended into Seaqaqa on the grounds it could not be economically
justified, but they agreed to retroactive financing for a short extension
(10 km) from the oLd terminus to the Seaqaqa foothills.
4.02      The appraisal team envisaged that cane carts would be hauLed from
the Labasa mill to Tabia by rail, loaded onto cane transport vehicles and
delivered to or near the fields where they would be moved about by tractor.
Once loaded with cane, the carts were to be picked up and redeposited at Tabia
to await transport to Labasa. To ensure roughly equal participation between
nacive Fijians and Fijians of ;.xdian descent, loans for one-half of cane
transport vehicles were to go to NLDC and one-half to more experienced
farmers. Even under the best management this svstem would have been unwieldly
and costly, but neither NLDC nor the Seaqaqa farmers had the managerial
capacity required to organize harvesting and transport, and in the first years
of the project emergency measures were used to get the cane to the mill before
the crushing season was over.
4.03      To improve flexibility, after 1977 most cane was carried from the
fields by lorry. However, this system also had disadvantages. Initially
there were problems in securing lorries and if they waited in the field, over-
heads were high. In addition, it was inefficient for the drivers/farmers to
off-load cane at the tramline once it was on a lorry, as delays at the termi-
nal resulted in a loss of cane weight on which price depended. For this
reason most lorries proceeded directly to the mill. To overcome these
problems, FSC introduced chain bundling in 1980. Under this approach, cutters
were to lay the cane on a row of chains which were pulled together to form
bundles which could be loaded onto the lorries and off-loaded onto the cane
carts. This system never found favor with the farmers and the cane carried in
this way declined from 10Z in 1980 to 8% in 1982. Cane cutters objected to
the system as the cane had to be carried to the bundles and owners objected to
weight losses incurred at the Tabia transfer point. In 1983, both the chain
bundling system and the tramline were abandoned and since then all Seaqaqa
cane has gone to the mill by lorry.
4.04      In retrospect two points are obvious.  First, Government and the
Bank seriously underestimated the organizational complexity of cane harvesting
and transport, and assigning these tasks to NLDC and the farmers (both with
limited managerial capacity) virtually ensured problems. Second, although
most cane in Fiji is transported by rail there is some evidence to suggest
that once cane is loaded onto lorries it is generally carried by road to the



mill as both the farmer and trucker wish to maximize cane weight and ensure
immediate payment. If a weighbridge had been installed at Tabia it is likely
that cane would have been dropped there; however, FSC rejected this idea as it
feared weight losses in che cane awaiting transport, and as it might establish
a demand for weighbridges elsewhere in Fiji. Some FSC and government offi-
cials believe that transport problems can still be resoLved by extending the
tramline into Seaqaqa. However, given current transport practices, it is
unlikely that farmer preferences would shift unless a weighbridge were
installed at the terminus and even with lOOZ utilization, the tramline
extension could not be economically justified.
Cane Harvesting
4.05      The second major implementation problem centered on the organization
of cane harvesting. The appraisal report assumed that harvesting gangs would
be composed primarily of farmers and family members supplemented by casual
labor from the area, as is the practice elsewhere in Fiji. In fact, newly
settled farmers tended to be young and have immature families, few farmers, if
any, had experience with the arduous work of cane cutting or were willing to
undertake it, and there was little or no casual labor available in the area.
For this reason, up to 2,000 laborers had to be recruited (in some cases from
the Eastern Islands), transported to the area, organized into gangs and
supported for a period of 4-6 months.
4.06      In the early years of the project, Government assisted the farmers
by recruiting Laborers, but harvesting was poorly organized, payments erratic
and living conditions were poor. For these reasons many cutters Left before
their contract periods were up. A study undertaken in 1981 by Institute of
Social and Administrative Studies of the University of the South Pacific high-
lights the adverse social conditions for cane cutters in Seaqaqa in relation
to substandard accommodation, unsanitary conditions, poor water supply, scarce
food supply, low productivity and low wages. These problems have not been
entirely resolved and weak farmer management coupled with transport problems
have meant that cane cutting in Seaqaqa remains only marginally attractive to
migrant Labor.
4.07      With the benefit of hindsight, it is evident that FSC should have
been charged with the recruitment of laborers, work allocation, and the
coordination of gangs and transport, and they should have been compensated for
these services. Reasonable accommodation should also have been provided for
cane cutters as a part of the project. For both social and financial reasons,
FSC wanted farmers to assume the responsibility for farm management and it
wished to use other agencies (such as the Labor Department) to carry out tasks
not routinely performed by FSC. However, inefficiencies resulting from poor
coordination were undoubtedly more costly to FSC and to the economy than the
cost of well organized services, and a strong managerial role for FSC should
have been encouraged.
Smallholder Debt Service
4.08      The project has encountered several debt service and farmer cash
flow problems which may be summarized as follows. First, large differences in



- 10 -
land clearing costs, due to differences in ground cover and topography, caused
variations in the size of the initial loans to individual farmers. This has
been a source of debt servicing problems and project managers now believe that
land clearing costs should have been shared equitably by all farmers. Second,
there has been very poor recovery on tractor loans due, in part, to the fact
that weak management and maintenance reduced tractor profitability. To avoid
defaults, FDB has collapsed some tractor loans into the farm development
package which has longer repayment terms. En retrospect, loans should not
have been made to small farmers for cane transport until the system had been
tested under stronger management.
4.09      In addition, initial repayment terms provided limited incentives for
production and were subsequently changed. Under the repayment terms proposed
by FAO and agreed by MAF, the FDB and the World Bank, loans for land clearing
and farm development (averaging F$11,000) were to be repaid in 10 years.
Under the original arrangement FDB was to retain 100% of net cane proceeds for
the first three years of the project and during this period living allowances
of F$400-F$500 per year were to be paid to the farmer. After three years,
retention was to drop to 752 of net proceeds until the loan was paid.
However, since farm income was unrelated to farm production for the first
three years, these terms reduced the motivation of traditional farmers to
produce cane and early in the project MAF and FDB recommended that the terms
be changed to increase the immediate incentives for production. Under the
current arrangements, FDB keeps all funds the first year, but refunds the
first FS200 in year 2 and the first F$400 in year 3, plus all proceeds over
F$1,000. From the fourth year on, FDB collects 75% of net cane proceeds up to
the amount which permits repaymenc of the loan in 12 additional years. The
Living allowance plus WFP food assistance was continued in the first 3
years.  Under these conditions the median farmer, with a net income of F$3,000
(para. 3.05) wouid clear about F$750 from sugarcane after the initial 3 years
of the project, although better farmers could potentially realize incomes of
F$4,000-F$5,000 annually.
4.10      In June 1984, FDB held accounts for about 780 Seaqaqa farmers
totaling about F$10 million of which some F$3-4 million had been repaid.
Since FDB is empowered to deduct loan payments before cane payments are passed
along to the farmers, it is reasonable to assume that most loans will be
recovered. However, as para. 4.09 indicates, many farmers have low returns
from sugarcane after FDB deductions and incomes are far below the national
average of nearly F$4,000/family. As a result, in June 1984, prior to the
cutting season, 167 accounts (21%) were in arrears, although these arrears
totalled only 5% of funds outstanding. To ease cash flow and repayment
problems, FSC has encouraged settler involvement in cane harvesting, MAF has
formed a task force to help weak farmers, and FDB has permitted land transfer
where farmers are unmotivated to work.
Other Problems
4.11      Road Standards.  The main access road to Seaqaqa has serious
maintenance problems. This is due to a number of unforeseen factors. First,
the road which links Labasa, in the north, to the project area was connected
to a national road in the south, and due to its improved alignment and good



- .1 -
surfacing the Seaqaqa road became a short-cut for all north-south traffic.
Second, large-scale logging developed in the area, in part, as a result of
improved access, and heavy Logging trucks have caused serious damage to the
roads. Third, the demise of the tramline increased lorry traffic between
Labasa and Seaqaqa. In general, then, the degree of economic development in
the area, which exceeded the expectations of both Government officials and
Bank staff has necessitated more maintenance than originally anticipated.-
4.12      Township Development.  Township development, on the other hand, has
lagged behind appraisal expectations, and although all lots are allocated,
only a handful of businesses are currently in operation. Owing to the slow
growth of the township, NLDC was aLso slow in providing basic ammenities
(electricity, water supply) which, in turn, discouraged investmenc. Recent
Bankwide reviews suggest, however, that slow gestation in commercial areas in
new settlements is the rule rather than the exception, and as economic acti-
vity has picked up recently, the town is expected to grow as the community
matures and incomes increase.
4.13      DeLays in the Drainage Component.  Project completion was delayed by
nearly three years due to delays in completion of the drainage component.
These delays were due, in turn, to staffing problems (DID staff had been
involved mEinly with irrigation) and deLays in photogrammetric mapping. In
addition, a number of sociaL problems were encountered while obtaining the
consent of faLners to drainage works which would increase Drainage Board
charges, and there were some complications over fishing rights. These prob-
lems have been resolved through the legal system and provide a strong founda-
tion for future work. It is unlikely, that such issues could have been
entirely foreseen, as such works had been undertaken under the colonial
government with few problems. When most problems were resolved, Cyclone Oscar
(1983) damaged some drainage works and further delayed project completion.
V. ASSESSMENT OF BANK PERFORMANCE AND LESSONS LEARNED
5.01      The appraisal report is well written and shows a good understanding
of the objectives of Fijian officials, and the project benefitted from initial
supervision by the author of the SAR who was fully familiar with project
assumptions. Thereafter, project supervision appears to have been somewhat
erratic due to frequent shifts in divisional responsibility and limited
continuity between missions. However, the two most important implementation
problems were covered in supervision reports and both were the subject of
independent consultant studies financed under the loan. The transport study
was very comprehensive but tended to emphasize technical and cost considera-
tions rather than management options. The came harvesting study, carried out
1/   Comments on load standards received from the Ministry of Communications,
Transport and Works are in Annex C.



- 12 -
by a local university, was also very thorough but did not go far enough in
recommending organizational and institutional changes which would have
benefitted cane cutters.
5.02      The main lessons learned under the project are as follows:
(a) cane production on low fertility soils appears technically possible
with good management and high fertilizer inputs (para. 3.03);
(b)  native Fijian farmers living outside their home communities have
performed adequately in commercial agriculture when provided with
appropriate incentives and institutional support (para. 3.06);
(c) the organization of cane transport and cane harvesting were beyond
the managerial capacity of new farmers in Seaqaqa and should have
been assigned to an agency whose capacity had been fully appraised
and costed under the project (para. 4.07); and
Cd)  repayment should have been structured to provide rewards for work in
the start-up years (para. 4.09).
5.03      In retrospect, it is clear that the failure to adequately appraise
the capacity of the smallholders and NLDC contributed to both harvesting and
transport problems by permitting the assumption that native Fijian farmers
would have managerial support for tasks they could not be expected to carry
out on their own. These problems might have been circumvented by incLuding
the appropriate technical specialists at appraisal and by providing more
attention to institutional and social issues in the appraisal report. The
project might also have profited from components to strengthen implementing
institutions.

project Completion Report on Fiji Sugar
Development Project (Loan 1226-FI3)
I refer to your letter dated 28th March, 1985 and the draft
of the Project Completion Report.
My only comment concerns section 4.11 on page 12 of the draft
report - Road Standards. I would think that the first factor mentioned,
that of the new main road link attracting traffic from other longer
routes, should have been foreseen and would hardly be unexpected. The
other two factors mentioned, that of damage caused by heavy logging
trucks especially when overloaded, and that of increasedbrry traffic
due to the demise of the tramline, both seem much more likely to be the
major causes of the problems encountered with this road.
Yours faithfully,
(D M Stewart)
for Permanent Secretary for works and Transport
