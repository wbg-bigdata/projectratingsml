MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EMECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR A BASIC AND SECONDARY EDUCATION SUPPORT PROJECT
1.      I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for the
equivalent of US$40 million to finance a project for basic and secondary
education support, which begins improv!ng quality and efficiency in basic and
secondary education. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate on an annuity basis, with a maturity of seventeen ye irs, including a four-
year grace period.
2.      Backeround.  Rapid expansion under pressure of high population growth
(over 3% p.a.) has characterized Algerian primary and secondary education in the
1980s. A 1990 Bank sector reportl/ found that, while educational expansion kept
pace with population growth, it has come at the expense of quality and
efficiency. Education reforms undertaken by the Government during the eighties
include: introduction of 9 years of basic education, introducing Arabic as the
language of instruction and replacing expatriate teachers.  A ne- secondary
education reform was started in 1992/93, focusing on improved cost-efficiency and
relevance of subject content. However, despite these reforms, pedagogic quality
and efficiency in basic and secondary education still need improvenent.
3.        More than 6 million pupils were enrolled in basic and secondary
education in 1990; gross enrollments reached 93% for grades 1 to 6 and 74% for
grades 7-9 in basih education, and 44% for grades 10-12 of secondary education.
Girls make up about 43% of the school population. All education and training is
public and the sector consumes about 33% of total recurrent government
expenditures. The Ministry of National Education's (MEN) budget, covering basic
and secondary education, accounts for 75% of all recurrent sector spending and
grew by almost 7% per annum (in constant 1985 prices) between 1985-90. This is
almost twice the growth of student enrollments and mainly due to accelerated
staff recruitment. Consequently, salary costs went up from 79% to 87% of total
educational expenditures since 1985 while non-wage expenditures decreased
significantly leading to lack of pedagogic materials in the schools and a
deteriorating learning environment which contributed to the decline in
instructional quality.
4.      Issues in basic and secondary education.  Because of the decline in
quality and efficiency, the education system is expensive and failure rates&/
are high compared to international standards. Only one out of five of the pupils
/       Improving quality and efficiency in basic and secondary education in Algeria; Report no. 8912-AL
(August 1980).
;,/    In 1989-90 there was an average repetition rate of more than 25% in grade 9 and about 33X of
grade S pupils dropped out before the end of the school year. Average basic education and
baccalaureat exan pass rates also remain low (around 20-30X since 1987).



- 2 -
who complete grade 9 obtains a basic education diploma; secondary exam results
(baccalaur6at) are similar.   The general explanations for the decline in
instructional quality and learning achievements are (i) poor quality of
instruction; (ii) insufficient assessment capacity of learning achievements in
schools; (iii) lack of pedagogic research and management capacity; and
(iv) deteriorating physical infrastructure and facilities in schools. Lowering
pupil-teacher ratios in the eighties failed to improve the quality of delivery.
Since most teachers need additional in-service training, teaching is still based
on memorization and blackboard copying. National and local pedagogic institutes
lack qualified education managers and researchers and have been unable to
maintain effective links with comparable institutes abroad to keep abreast of
international innovative approaches.   The lack of an effective learning and
quality assessment system to complement the existing exam system, makes it
difficult for the Government to develop adequate longer term reform strategies.
Finally, insufficient supply of critical pedagogic materials to schools for
practical experimenting and illustration of what is taught makes teaching less
effective.  Many teacher guides and pedagogic background documentation are in
short supply or unavailable.   This hampers teachers' access to professional
feedback.
5.      Government strategy.    The Government recognizes the importance of
better quality in basic and secondary education and its current priorities for
this sector are to: (i) strengthen and renovate educational research capacity;
(ii) revise programs and improve curriculum design mechanisms to make what
children learn more relevent to their cultural and social environment;
(iii) impr.ve teacher and staff training; (iv) improve the school environment by
providing adequate pedagogic materials; (v) strengthen management capacity at
central and provincial levels; and (vi) improve cost and financing mechanisms in
education. The Government also plans to increase access to basic education to
include 1001 of the 6-year age group and increase attainment ratios by lowering
repetition and dropout rates. As a first step, the Government will carry out by
December 1995 a study to review the quality and cost-efficiency of the production
and distribution of schoolbooks.
6.      Lessons learned.    Lessons learned from previous lending have been
incorporated into the proposed project.   The Completion Reports of earlier
projects have emphasized the need for: (i) increased involvement of the
Borrower's technical staff in project identification, design and preparation;
(ii) improved assessment of absorptive capacity of the executing institutions and
taking better into account administrative procedures of the Borrower during
project implementation and supervision; (iii) assigning the administration of the
loan and, when possible, the management of the project to a single entity with
the necessary leverage to resolve issues promptly and sufficient resources to
monitor implementation; and (iv) providing adequate preparation, including
extensive advance training to local staff for decentralization of project
responsibilities.
7.      Rationale for Bank involvement.  Bank strategy in Algeria takes into
account the political and socio-economic environment, while allowing for
sufficient flexibility to adjust to improved conditions.   The Bank supports
Government strategy of meeting social sector needs by improving quality and



- 3 -
efficiency of basic social services. Basic and secondary education is a key
priority, since almost 50% of the populacion is under the age of 15. A Bank
sector study on quality and efficiency in education1r was completed in 1990; the
proposed project is based on this study and complements the Bank's on-going
Vocational Training project (Loan no.2977-AL) and Science and Technology
University Development project (Loan no.3266-AL). A Health Management project is
also underway and will contribute to developing major institutional changes in
the management and operations of the health system.
8.      The proposed project is the first step in a long process which will
ultimately lead to a basic and secondary education system that adequately
prepares Algerian children for a productive social and economic life. The Bank's
international experience in this sector will contribute to the Government's
larger objective of social and economic reform. This is the first Bank-financed
project in Algeria to target quality and efficiency at the base of the education
and training system. ContinuAd Bank support would be based on the outcomes of
this project. Future follow-up operations would focus on structural issues in
this sub-sector and on long term sustainable educational development.
9.      Project obiectives.  Project objectives are focused on the immediate
needs of the sector and aim to (i) introduce a pilot system for assessing
learning outcomes and quality in basic and secondary education; (ii) strengthen
the quality of pedagogic research programs; and (iii) pror.ote a more effective
use of pedagogic materials  in schools.    The project would improve  the
Government's capacity to measure the system's performance and provide decision-
makers with information on the structural problems of the sector.   Teacher
training and improved supply and use of pedagogic materials would contribute to
more effective learning in schools and help teachers to teach better.   By
improving assessment and pedagogic research, the project will also assist the
Government in monitoring the implementation of the ongoing secondary educa_ion
reform and evaluating the impact on quality of the introduction of the 9 years
of basic education system.
10.     Proiect DescriRtion.  The project would have three components and be
implemented over 8 years.  The first component (US$3.3 million; 6% of total
estimated base cost) would finance (i) the development and introduction of a
pilot national assessment system by the MEN; (ii) improvement of existing pupil
testing, orientation and selection procedures through training of Algerian
experts and creation of computerized test-item banks; and (iii) development of
six groups of standardized quality and efficiency indicators based on the OECD&/
model. Six Regional School Orientation and Selection Centers would participate
in field tests and provide the vital link to the schools and teachers.  The
second component (US$2.0 million; 4% of total estimated base cost) would finance
(i) the institutional strengthening of the National Pedagogic Institute (IPN)

through training and provision of pedagogic equipment; (ii) pedagogic research
programs on design and evaluation of curricula and schoolbooks; and
(iii) provision of about 5,000 new library books, research journals and
periodical3 in pedagogic research areas relevant to IPN.   Objectives and
activities of project-financed research programs and studies would be jointly
reviewed by the MEN and the Bank and would aim to improve the coherence of
curriculum content between subjects and levels of basic and secondary education
in  Mathematics,   French,  Arabic  and  Science.         The  third  component
(US$51.0 million; 90% of estimated total base cost) would improve the supply and
use of pedagogic materials in schools through: (a) provision of pedagogic
materials for about 14,000 basic and secondary schools, of which 3,500 are under
construction; (b) improved provision and use of school science laboratory
products in about 3,500 grade 7-12 schools, rehabilitation of CAMEMD (Center for
Procurement and Maintenance of Equipment and Pedagogic Materials) storage and
distribation facilities for such materials and the provision of related
equipment, teacher- and staff training; and (c) provision of spare parts,
equipment, technical assistance, teacher- and staff training, rehabilitation of
CAMEMD maintenance facilities for improved maintenance services to schools, and
experts services to carry out a studv on safety and maAintenance of pedagogic
materials in schools.
11.     ?_roject management.    The project would be  executed by t:le YEN.
Coordination of implementation and project administration would be the
responsibtlity of the Project Management Unit (PMU) with funding at levels,
membership and administrative staff whose qualifications and experience shall be
satisfactory to the Bank.  The PMU would report directly to the Minister of
National Education and be responsible for maintaining adequate working
relationships with the Bank and the Banque Alg6rienne de Dsveloppement (BAD).
The PMU would coordinate day-to-day project management and organize Annual
Project Implementation Reviews (APIRs) and a Mid-term project Review.
12.     Cost and financing.  Total project cost is estimated at about US$64.0
million with a foreign exchange cost of US$40.0 million or 63X of total project
costs. The proposed Bank loan would finance all fnreign exchange costs. The
Government would cover local costs, principally on-the-job training of teaching
and non-teaching staff, incremental staff salaries, maintenance and civil works
and most project management costs.   A breakdown of project costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Algeria are given in Schedules
C and D,  respectively.    The  Staff Appraisal Report NO 11537-AL,  dated
February 23, 1993 is being distributed separately.
13.     Agreed actions.   During negotiations, agreement was obtained on the
following: (a) procedures and content of the APIRs and the mid-term project
implementation review; (b) the carrying out by MEN of a study of the safety and
maintenance of pedagogic materials in schools; and (c) annual release of budget
funds to MEN as will be necessary to ensure effective project implementation.
loan effectiveness would be conditional upon: (a) MEN having launched bid-
invitations for technical assistance, overseas training packages, pedagogic



-5-
materials and technical equipment necessary for successful project start-up; and
(b) MEN having established the PHU, with membership, responsibilities,
administrative staff and funding at levelt satisfactory to the Bank.
14.     Procurement.  Goods financed by the Bank wozld be procured through ICB
except for a small number of proprietary and/or single source items or other
items locally available, as justified.   Expert services would be procured
according to tha Bank Guidelines on consultants. Standard bid documents have
been prepared by the MEN and have been reviewed and approved by the Bank.
15.     Environmental asRects.   This project was reviewed under the Bank's
Environmental Assessment procedures and was determir.ed to fall within
Category "C", for projects which do not result in significant environmental
impact.
16.     Benefits.  The project would yield the following benefits: (a) improved
quality and relevance of learniiig content in basic and secondary education;
(b) improved quantitative and qualitative measurement of pupils' learning
performance through staff training, pedago,gic research and improved assessment
of learning outcomes affecting about 1.3 million pupils in 2,400 basic and
secondary schools; (c) a more effective pedagogic information system, thereby
enabling education decision makers to develop !mproved longer-term reform
strategies based on reliable quantitative and qualitative assessment;
(d) improved teacher- and staff training programs, thereby improving the
performance of about 1,800 pedagogic counsellors and inspectors and contributing
to improved pedagogic feedback up and down the system; and (e) improved supply,
management, maintenance and use of modern pedagogic materials to about 14,000
basic and secondary schools, contributing to better learning for about 5 million
pupils and improved teaching of about 200,000 teachers and to improved competency
in the use and maintenance of these materials for about 100 higher technicians,
1,000 school lab technicians and 29,000 science teachers.
17.     Risks.   The project's main risk lies in the present economic and
political situation which could influence strategies in the education sector and
commitment to project objectives. In this climate, it will also be difficult to
bring about institutional changes. To take this situation into account project
design has been kept simple and its objectives focused exclusively on the
immediate basic and secondary education needs. This has resulted in a high sense
of project ownership within the MEN. A second risk lies in the capacity of
education decision makers, administrative managers and teachers to implement
innovative changes.   The system has a history of 30 years of centralized
management and curriculum planning.   Project implementation procedures and
adequate monitoring and evaluation mechanisms take this into account and provide
sufficient scope for timely corrective action. A list of operational project
implementation indicators has been discussed and agreed upon with the MEN. A
third risk lies in the absorptive capacity and required continuity and quality
of  project  management  staff,  which  have  been  identified  as  critical
implementation factors in previous Bank projects.   Project design has taken
absorptive capacity into account. Adequate training for project management staff
would be provided. Transparent project management procedurer would be in effect

during implementation. Staff and other resources necessary for effective rroject
management and coordination have been identified.
18.     Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Lirectors
approve the proposed loan.
