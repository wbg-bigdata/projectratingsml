POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:            Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC)
Guarantor:           Republic of Cyprus
Amount:              US$16.0 million equivalent in various currencies.
Terms:               Fifteen years, including three years of grace, at 8.25
percent per annum.
Project
Description:        (a)  The proposed project would help finance the foreign
exchange costs of the transmission and distribution
components to be constructed between 1981 and 1983,
as part of EAC's Five Year Expansion Program (1980-
1984). The Project will both expand and reinforce
EAC's transmission and distribution in southern
Cyprus, and includes installation of: (i) 28 miles
of 132 (66) kV overhead transmission lines, together
with associated substation equipment and transformers;
(ii) nine 66 kV substation line and transformer bays
and eight 66/11 kV substation transformers; (iii) 156
miles of 11 kV overhead distribution lines and under-
ground cables; (iv) 285 miles of low voltage distri-
bution lines and cables; (v) 585 distribution trans-
formers; and (vi) associated consultancy services.
(b)  The proposed project will enable EAC to meet the sub-
stantially increased demand stemming from heavy on-
going investment in tourism, industry and agriculture,
especially in the Moni-Limassol and Paphos areas,
besides meeting additional demand in Nicosia and
Larnaca. In addition, it will reinforce and expand
distribution in several hundred villages scattered
throughout south Cyprus. Major beneficiaries would
be existing consumers, especially industrial consumers
who will benefit from the availability of additional
power, and about 51,000 new consumers, including about
20,000 rural consumers.
(c) There are no major risks associated with the project,
barring major political changes in the island.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY OF CYPRUS
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
FOR A POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC), with the guarantee of the
Republic of Cyprus, for the equivalent of US$16.0 million, to help finance a
portion of the foreign exchange costs of a power transmission and distribution
project. The loan would have a term of 15 years, including three years of
grace, with interest at 8.25 percent per annum. Additional financing of the
foreign exchange costs of the project ($8.5 million) would be provided out of
a Euro-currency loan.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last economic report on Cyprus (No. 1151-CY) was circulated
to the Executive Directors in May 1976. An updating economic mission visited
Cyprus in October/November 1979. While the mission had discussions with
the Government as well as the Turkish Cypriot authorities and visited the
economically important areas in all parts of the island, a sufficiently
reliable economic data base is still not available for northern Cyprus,
which is under Turkish Cypriot control. Hence, while the economic report will
provide a detailed analysis of the Government-controlled part in south Cyprus,
a meaningful review of the economic situation and prospects of the whole
island has not been possible, although some limited data have now become
available on the economic situation in the north. The report is expected to
be circulated to the Executive Directors later in June. The mission's findings
are summarized below.
General Background
3.        The economy of the whole island grew at over 7.5 percent per annum
between 1960 and 1973, despite tension between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot communities. The major factors contributing to this growth were: a
competent public administration, dynamic entrepreneurs, a high rate of invest-
ment especially in the private sector, a rapid increase in agricultural
exports contributing to a strong overall balance of payments, and flexible
fiscal and monetary policies, which helped to stimulate growth while main-
taining domestic price stability.
4.        The 1974 events brought a sudden, although temporary, end to this
long period of successful economic growth. Since then, the country has de
facto been divided into two parts by a ceasefire line, with increasingly
less movement of people or goods between them. The southern part, under the
Government's control, constitutes 64 percent of the area of the island, and
accounts for over 77 percent of total population. The northern part of the
island, under Turkish Cypriot control, has 23 percent of total population



- 2 -
living on 36 percent of the land area. About one-third of the total popula-
tion was displaced by the 1974 events, with nearly 180,000 Greek Cypriots
moving south, and approximately 45,000 Turkish Cypriots moving north. Most of
the displaced population has been resettled. In the expectation of an island-
wide political solution based on the principle of federation, the Turkish
Federated State of Cyprus was proclaimed in February 1975. Ul-sponsored
intercommunal talks to find a possible political solution have been held
intermittently since 1978, but prospects for agreeing on a permanent solution
remain highly uncertain.
Recent Developments and Short-Term Outlook in the Area under Government Control
5.        Immediately following the 1974 events, with the massive displacement
of population and severance of sectoral linkages, GNP dropped by some 19
percent in southern Cyprus, and the unemployment rate jumped to nearly
25 percent of the labor force. The balance of payments position was affected,
as exports and imports fell by about 55 percent in the second half of 1974.
This drop in export earnings reflected the loss from the non-exploitation of
about one-half of Cyprus' cultivated land area (which produced over half of
the island's agricultural exports) and non-utilization at the time of about
two-thirds of the island's tourist facilities.
6.        Government policy to reactivate the economy in the area under its
control has been highly successful. The economy recovered rapidly, with GDP,
in real terms, growing annually by an average of about 17 percent in each of
the years 1976 and 1977, and by about 6.8 percent in each of the years 1978
and 1979. The growth rate in these last two years has slowed down largely
because the economy is rapidly reaching full capacity, with the level of
unemployment decreasing from over 16 percent in 1975 to less than 2 percent by
the end of 1979. Construction, tourism, and manufacturing are now all suffer-
ing from critical labor shortages. In the rural sector, peak labor demand can
only be met with difficulty. To lessen the severity of this shortage, the
Government, with the cooperation of the private sector, has increased indus-
trial training programs and has started to call back the 12,000 construction
workers who left temporarily for the Middle East after 1974. Natural growth
of the labor force is projected to average about 1.3 percent per annum in the
medium-term; but the Government hopes to push this rate to 1.8 percent, by
bringing more women into the labor force and encouraging more workers to
return from abroad.
7.        Until 1977, the rapid recovery of the economy was accompanied
by relative price stability. This has since changed. Although the rate of
inflation is rather modest compared to most other countries, it reached
about 7.5 percent in 1978, and 10 percent by end 1979. Having a highly open
economy, with imports representing more than 60 percent of GDP (at current
prices), Cyprus is susceptible to international increases in the prices of
imports. Furthermore, increased private and public consumption and public
sector investment expenditures have pushed up domestic demand, particularly
for local products, beyond the productive capacity of the economy. Under
these conditions it has been easy for labor to push for wage settlements
at rates exceeding increases in productivity, so as to recover part of the



- 3 -
salaries lost after 1974. The fact that a high share of public and private
investment goes to housing, further aggravates the imbalance of domestic
demand and supply.
8.        Expansionary public finance and monetary policies were the instru-
ments used by the Government to achieve the successful reactivation of the
economy after 1974. However, the budget has remained expansionary, even after
the economy reached full employment in 1978. Further, with public savings
remaining negative and an overall budgetary deficit averaging 6 to 8 percent
of GDP, some of the deficit was financed by borrowing from the Central Bank.
The Government still believes that it has little room to cut down expendi-
tures because of: (i) the need to grant salary increases to civil servants,
whose pay was frozen until mid-1977; (ii) the continued assistance to some
refugees; and (iii) the need to complete ongoing investment projects. There
appears, however, to be significant room to increase government revenues, as
tax revenues currently equal only about 13 percent of GDP. The Government
has recently submitted to Parliament a major tax package, which if approved,
even with some expected pruning, should help improve the ratio of taxes to GDP
significantly.
9.        Under the circumstances, the effort to restrain domestic price in-
creases has been left almost entirely to the Central Bank. It initially took
only limited measures to restrict new loans to importers and distributors and
to reduce loans by hire-purchase finance companies, but, in late 1979, more
comprehensive measures were taken to reduce bank liquidity. The effectiveness
of monetary policy, however, remains hampered by the fixed interest rate struc-
ture with an absolute ceiling of 7 percent per annum on household savings and
time deposits, and 9 percent on lending. The Council of Ministers has there-
fore also recently proposed to Parliament that the interest rate ceilings be
removed and the Government be authorized to set interest rates in accordance
with prevailing economic conditions. The proposal is currently under review
by Parliament.
10.       Despite sharply increasing imports triggered by expanding local
demand for consumer and investment goods, the overall balance of payments
has remained sound. Net foreign exchange reserves have increased since 1976,
and equalled about five months of imports at the end of 1979. Moreover,
further substantial increases in exports as well as increased revenues from
tourism are expected.
Medium-Term Prospects
11.       A Third Emergency Economic Action Plan (1979-1981) was approved by
the Government in 1979 for the area under its control. It calls for a rela-
tively modest, but realistic, GDP growth rate of about 5 percent per year,
with manufacturing providing the lead (8.2 percent per year). It foresees a
major shift in development strategy toward medium-scale and more capital-
intensive investments, in contrast to the preceding two Plans, which empha-
sized quick return, labor-intensive, light industries to absorb the large pool
of unemployed labor which resulted from the 1974 events. It also emphasizes
investment in higher technology industries and consolidation of small factories
into larger units, to realize economies of scale. Exports and tourism will
continue to be the major engines of growth, with import substitution being
limited to a selected few industries.



- 4 -
12.       Domestic savings, which are projected to increase from about 12
percent of GDP (at current prices) in 1978, to about 16 percent in 1981, will
finance about half of the planned investment. The remaining financial require-
ments will come from net factor incomes from abroad and from foreign borrowing
which is expected to double from $96 million in 1978 to close to $200 million
in 1981. Since the total labor force is unlikely to increase by more than 1.8
percent per annum, the Plan implies an annual increase in labor productivity
of some 3.4 percent. Achievement of such an increase will, however, require
major changes in the present structure of the economy, including increasingly
capital-intensive investments in manufacturing and agriculture, and a pro-
gressive shift of the labor force from relatively low productivity employment
in agriculture, into more productive medium and larger scale manufacturing and
services. This structural change would enable Cyprus to capitalize on its
hard working and relatively well trained labor force, the existence of dynamic
and sophisticated entrepreneurs, and its excellent geographical location,
which enables it to tap Middle Eastern as well as European markets.
13.       The increased level of investments will require additional efforts
to mobilize domestic savings, if foreign borrowing and debt service payments
are to be kept at prudent levels. Currently, gross domestic savings are low
and no savings come from the budget. It is therefore essential that efforts
be made to ensure that the saving rate increases to about 18 percent by 1985.
Such an increase is achievable, provided policies are designed and adopted to
increase public savings to about 3 percent of GDP (a figure achieved before
1973), and private savings up to about 15 percent of GDP by 1985. A lower
savings rate iould almc't inevitably require a reduction in planned levels of
investment, with a consequent impact on future growth.
14.       Even assuming that Government will strengthen its anti-inflationary
policies and further restrict internal demand through such measures as higher
taxation, and despite good prospects for export growth, the overall balance
of payments outlook over the medium-term will depend substantially on the
country's success in increasing its level of external borrowing. Consider-
ing the continuing political uncertainties, Cyprus's recent experience in
mobilizing external resources has been quite encouraging. It successfully
raised Eurodollar borrowings in late 1977 of $30 million, followed in July
1978 by a $40 million loan; both were syndicated by Chase Manhattan. Another
loan of $10 million in November 1978 was syndicated by Bank of America. The
country is also beginning to attract significant export and suppliers' credits.
These forms of external borrowing are perhaps indicative of the future trend,
since access to long-term concessionary bilateral and multilateral support is
expected to continue to be limited. As a consequence, despite some continuing
German, UK and Council of Europe assistance, most future public external
borrowings to cover the projected current account deficits will have to come
from commercial sources, either in the form of export or suppliers' credit, or
commercial bank loans.
15.       Bank efforts to date have not only been directed towards encouraging
Cyprus to diversify its sources of official aid, but also to use Bank projects
as catalysts to attract other external support, including cofinancing with
commercial banks. Thus, Cyprus obtained cofinancing from the Kuwait Fund for



-5-
the Nicosia-Limassol Highway Project (Loan No. 1344-CY) and the Vasilikos-
Pendaskinos Project (Loan No. 1658-CY). Financial assistance from the Council
of Europe filled the external financing gap in the Pitsilia Rural Development
Project (Loan No. 1483-CY), commercial bank cofinancing was arranged in
connection with the Third Cyprus Development Bank Project (Loan No. 1744-CY),
and substantial suppliers' credit and other financing is being arranged in
connection with the proposed power project. Despite this record, Cyprus's
access to external funds is still limited, in relation to its needs and its
economic potential. In other words, growth prospects are likely to face
continued constraints deriving from balance of payments and the availability
of external credits.
16.       Cyprus' external debt has so far remained low, because of the past
policy of financing development from internal resources and the availability
of substantial levels of foreign grant aid from Greece and UNHCR, mainly
for refugee assistance (averaging $35 to $55 million per year since 1974).
Total long-term public debt outstanding and disbursed was $240 million as of
December 31, 1979. Public debt service was only 5 percent of exports at the
end of 1979. However, given the increasing future reliance on relatively hard
commercial financing, debt service is projected to exceed 18 percent of goods
and nonfactor services by the mid-eighties. The Bank's share of debt outstand-
ing and disbursed declined from 51 percent in 1974 to 18 percent at the end of
1979, while its share in debt service declined from 45 percent in 1974 to 15
percent in 1979. Thus, the Bank's exposure, once quite high, has now declined
to a more normal level and is expected to continue to decline further, as
Cyprus continues to diversify its sources of external borrowings. Given Cyprus'
low external debt and debt service ratio, and the Government's excellent
record of economic management, the country is creditworthy for additional Bank
borrowing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CYPRUS
17.       Bank lending to Cyprus began in 1963.  As of March 31, 1980, it
comprised sixteen loans totalling $120.5 million (net of cancellations),
of which about $101.0 million was held by the Bank. The main areas of con-
centration have been infrastructure (power, sewerage, and ports), industry
through the Cyprus Development Bank, agriculture (irrigation and integrated
rural development), and water resources development. Details of Bank loans to
Cyprus are given in Annex II.
18.       The events of 1974 had a substantial impact on some of the on-going
Bank-financed projects as well as on planned operations. In particular, the
execution of the following projects was affected: (i) the sewerage project in
Famagusta, which lies entirely in the area controlled by the Turkish Cypriots;
and (ii) the construction of the Nicosia-Morphou highway, the alignment of
which coincides with the ceasefire line. The Nicosia Sewerage Project, which
straddles the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot areas of Nicosia, was also
uncompleted. However, as a result of the initiative of the UNDP and the Bank,
Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot cooperation on this matter was obtained and
a formal agreement to complete the project was reached in September 1978.



- 6 -
These arrangements are now being efficiently implemented by both sides, and
the project is expected to be completed by mid 1980, in a way that will
benefit both communities. As regards planned operations, a number of projects
under study or contemplated before 1974, which were also intended to benefit
directly both communities, could not be pursued because of the de facto
division of the island.  The Bank, together with UNDP, will continue to
explore areas where cooperation appears possible, although prospects are quite
limited until a political settlement is reached.
19.       The Bank's objectives in Cyprus are to finance projects to meet the
needs for higher productivity and exports; invest in essential infrastructure
which can be justified in the context of the whole island; and cooperate in
attracting long-term development capital from other sources. Within this
overall context, Bank lending has made a substantial contribution towards
assisting Cyprus to recover from the 1974 events, especially in obtaining long
term financing from other sources. Once a political settlement is reached,
additional opportunities for Bank involvement would likely emerge, with the
Bank seeking to help both communities through support of projects to improve
living standards of those groups left out of the growing prosperity, and
encourage development of a national water policy and utilization of other
resources on which both communities are dependent. Projects likely to
materialize over the next two fiscal years include those to promote fruit and
vegetable exports, upgrade the island's road network, and develop water
resources.
20.       IFC's first investment in Cyprus was in a cement company in 1972.
The company has since become a leader in the country's successful export
drive. IFC has most recently invested in an asbestos cement pipe plant, and
is currently exploring opportunities for further investment on the island.
As of March 31, 1980, gross commitments totalled $3.6 million, of which
$1.9 million are still held by IFC. Details of IFC investments in Cyprus are
given in Annex II.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR AND THE BORROWER
Energy Resources and Policy
21.       With the exception of solar and wind energy, which are utilized to
a limited extent mainly for domestic hot water and ground water extraction
respectively, Cyprus has no known indigenous energy resources. It is depen-
dent on imported fuel to meet virtually all energy requirements. The main
source of energy is imported oil, which constituted about 11 percent of total
imports in 1978, including both refined products and crude for local pro-
cessing. Since nuclear power generation does not appear to be a practical
alternative in view of the small size of the system, the expansion of power
output will continue to be based on thermal generation for the foreseeable
future. In addition, some prospects for using certain sources of renewable
energy appear to exist and this matter is proposed to be studied in the near
future.



-7 -
22.       Given this background, Government policy is primarily directed
towards (i) preventing excessive and unnecessary consumption of oil through
measures designed to limit consumption and reduce waste; and (ii) encouraging
study and use of alternatives, particularly solar and coal. As part of its
conservation effort, the Government has kept prices of gasoline higher than
prices of other petroleum products, and even restricted week-end use of
private vehicles on an odd-even basis. It is also considering other steps,
including gasoline rationing, parking restrictions in city centers, and
additional vehicle taxes, coupled with efforts to improve public transport.
In addition, it is carrying out, with UNDP assistance, an energy conservation
study. It is also considering legislative and other actions to reduce unneces-
sary power consumption (especially in industry) and energy used for heating
and cooling.
23.       The overall responsibility for the energy sector rests with the
Ministry of Commerce and Industry, although pricing and financing policies are
formulated and decided upon in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance.
Major policy is framed by the Council of Ministers.
The Borrower
24.       Responsibility for public electricity generation and supply rests
with the Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC). It was established in 1952
to take the place of some 16 separate enterprises which had been supplying
power on a limited basis up to that time. Since its establishment, EAC has
acquired control of all public power supplies and erected two steam generat-
ing stations, one at Dhekelia and one at Moni, both on the southern coast of
Cyprus. It has also established a nation-wide transmission and distribution
system serving all major population centers, including the provision of some
power to all yillages in south Cyprus by the end of 1979.  Although since July
1974, it has had no access to the transmission and distribution network in
northern Cyprus, EAC has continued to supply power to that part of the country
without interruption at any time, and without receiving any payments, just as
the Turkish Cypriots have continued to supply without-any payment much of the
water consumed in Nicosia. This demonstrates the continued interlinkage and
interdependence between the two de facto separate parts of the island. How-
ever, to maintain and operate power facilities in the north, the Turkish
Cypriots established the Turkish Cypriot Electricity Authority (KIBTEK) in
1975.
25.       EAC is an autonomous, government owned public utility, governed by
a seven member Board, appointed by the Council of Ministers for five-year
terms. The Chief Executive Officer, or General Manager, is appointed by
the Board. The current General Manager also holds the post of Chief Engineer.
Present staffing, which totals 1,435, includes 130 engineers and 625 other
technical staff. While this staffing is adequate, a staff expansion of about
11 percent is planned in conjunction with the proposed expansion of EAC's
system. Overall, EAC is a technically competent and well-managed authority.
26.       EAC establishes its own level and structure of tariffs, subject to
approval by the Council of Ministers. Since early 1974, tariffs have been
raised four times, partially to meet higher fuel costs and partially to



- 8 -
compensate for losses incurred from power consumed in the north, since EAC has
not been able to recover payment for power supplied to the north since July
1974. An increase of about 50 percent in early 1974 was followed by a further
increase of about 12 percent in September 1978. In addition, since 1977 an
automatic fuel price adjustment surcharge has been incorporated into the tariff
structure. Despite a 43.5 percent increase in EAC's average revenue per kWh
sold during 1975-1979, EAC has only been able to earn a rate of return on
revalued assets of about 2.7 percent in 1979, and faces serious financial
difficulties, essentially because of non-receipt of payment for power supplied
to the north (about 196 GWh in 1979). However, if power supplied to the north
is taken into account, with revenues to be collected calculated at appropriate
bulk rates, the rate of return on revalued assets nominally earned by EAC
would have been over 10 percent in 1979. EAC's financial difficulties are
discussed in greater detail below (paras. 36-39).
27.       The Bank has been closely involved in EAC's development since the
early 1960's. It has so far made four loans, totalling $37.8 million, to
assist in financing the construction and periodic expansion of the Moni Power
Station as well as related transmission and distribution facilities. (Loan
335-CY for $21.0 million in 1963, of which only $16.4 million was disbursed
due to cost savings; Loan 494-CY for $2.8 million in 1967, of which only $2.3
million was disbursed due to cost savings; Loan 649-CY for $5.0 million in
1969; and Loan 831-CY for $9.0 million in 1972.) Through these loans the Bank
has also succeeded in stimulating substantial institution building which has
helped EAC develop into a modern and sophisticated (though small) utility.
The Bank intrcduced international competitive bidding to EAC, which is now
routine for most of its procurement.  All four projects were completed satis-
factorily.  A Project Ferformance Audit Report, No. 2259, covering the Fourth
Power Project was circulated to the Executive Directors on November 9, 1978.
It confirms the satisfactory execution of the project and satisfactory per-
formance of EAC, although it also notes the above mentioned increasing finan-
cial difficulties faced by EAC as a result of its inability to receive payment
for power supplied to the north.
Power Capacity and Demand
28.       Cyprus' installed public generating capacity at the end of 1979
totalled 264 MW, and maximum demand on the system has so far been 194 MW. In
addition, small diesel standby sets exist at industrial plants, hospitals,
communications centers and airfields, with a total capacity of about 10 MW.
Small diesel sets are also operated by KIBTEK in a few villages in the north.
In addition KIBTEK has installed a 30 MW gas turbine, which is not being used
because of the lack of foreign exchange to import needed fuel.
29.       After a drop in consumption following the 1974 events, consumption
in the south returned to the pre-1974 level by early 1976, and has since
increased at an average of about 8.5 percent annually. Industrial sales in
the south have increased since 1975, reflecting the emphasis on industrial
development, and now constitute about 35 percent of total sales. Commercial
and domestic sales account for a further 30 and 26 percent of sales in the
south, with the remaining attributed to street lighting and irrigation. About
20 percent of EAC's generated power is supplied to the north. EAC estimates



- 9 -
that Turkish Cypriot consumption is growing by about 8 percent per annum. No
sales breakdown for the north is available for 1979, but, according to KIBTEK's
1978 figures, about 62 percent of the power supplied to the north in that year
was utilized for domestic consumption, 17 percent for c-mmercial, 14 percent
for industry, and the remaining for irrigation and street lighting.
30.       The national (south and north) load forecasts for the period 1979
through 1990 show an average annual growth rate of about 8 percent through
1984, and an average rate of about 7 percent thereafter. Maximum demand is
projected to increase from 194 MW in 1979 to 296 MW in 1984, and 320 MW in
1985. Although these forecasts may be somewhat optimistic, given the expected
slower growth of the economy in the south and the likely economic stagnation
in the north, they still provide a reasonable basis for future planning.
Moreover, the expansion program is being carried out in stages, which enables
it to be adjusted as appropriate. To meet the expected demand, EAC's proposed
1980-1984 expansion program would add 120 MW to the power system. This would
increase total installed capacity to 356 MW in 1984, since two 14 MW units in
the old Dhekelia A plant will be retired by that time. Firm capacity would
increase from 234 MW to 342 MW.
EAC's 1980-1984 Expansion Program and Financing
31.       Planning for this program was initiated before 1974.  However, the
de facto division of the island and temporary drop in demand following the
1974 events made it necessary to adjust the program to meet the new conditions.
This modified program, which has been further scaled down to make it more
financially manageable for EAC, includes the following: (i) construction by
1982 of two 60 MW oil fueled steam power units at Dhekelia B in southern
Cyprus, together with associated transmission lines, to meet growing demand
and begin replacement of the ageing and fuel inefficient Dhekelia A power
station; (ii) extension and reinforcement of the existing transmission system
in the Limassol and Paphos areas, including substation construction and rein-
forcement; and (iii) extension and reinforcement of the distribution system to
serve about 51,000 new consumers, including about 20,400 rural consumers. The
total cost of EAC's investment program, including interest during construction,
is estimated to be about $158.0 million equivalent, of which about $102.0
million is in foreign exchange. Construction of the power plant is expected
to start in the latter part of 1980.
32.       EAC's expansion program was prepared with the assistance of inter-
national consultants, who studied the feasibility of several alternative
oil-fuel generation schemes, before recommending the least cost proposal
adopted by EAC. The study did not consider any fuel source other than oil,
largely because the analysis took place well before the latest round of 1979
oil price increases. By that time tenders for the generation station had
already been issued and contracts concluded, and EAC considered it too
costly, in terms of time and the additional project costs involved, to post-
pone the investment program pending a study of the feasibility of using coal.
Moreover, use of coal would have required substantial secondary investments,
given the lack of coal handling facilities in the Dhekelia area. Nevertheless,
in view of the growing importance of coal as an alternative to high priced
oil, EAC has agreed to carry out a detailed study to explore the feasibility



- 10 -
of using coal for future additional units at the Dhekelia station and for the
future expansion of EAC's generating capacity. The study would also include
an assessment of the environmental impact of coal use, particularly given the
importance of tourism in Cyprus (Loan Agreement, Section 4.05).
33.       The expansion program constitutes the largest one ever undertaken by
EAC. It is expected to be financed as follows:
-------US$ Million Equivalent-------
Local    Foreign    Total    Percent
German Capital and KfW Assistance              -        14.9        14.9      9.4

Total                            56.3      102.0       158.3    100
34.       This financing plan has been agreed with EAC during negotiations.
The Government has further confirmed its full support for it, as well as its
intention to ensure that it is adequately financed.  The bulk of the financing
requirements have already been obtained or are in the process of being final-
ized, and no major difficulties are expected. The German assistance, which
would finance the turbo generators, has been approved by KfW's management and
requires only formal German Government approval, which is expected shortly.
The German capital assistance ($5.5 million equivalent) is expected to be
granted at 4-1/2 percent interest for a term of 15 years including 3 years
grace. KfW financing ($9.4 million equivalent) is expected to have an
interest rate of about 6 percent, on similar terms. The Austrian financing,
which will finance the already signed boiler contract, has been obtained. The
terms are 5.5 percent for a period of 15 years including 3 years grace. With
regard to the proposed Euro-currency borrowing, the Government has already
approached the London market and obtained a commitment in principle for up to
$60.0 million equivalent. However, based on the above financing plan, EAC
has confirmed that it will contract for no more than $40.0 million; it expects
the loan to be finalized within the next three months. The proposed Euro-
currency borrowing will be used primarily to finance (i) the down payments for
the generation component not covered by the German and Austrian financing;
(ii) that portion of the transmission and distribution component not covered
by the proposed Bank loan, to the extent that suppliers' credit is not avail-
able; and (iii) some local costs, to the extent EAC's own cash generation is
insufficient. The bulk of the local costs and about 37 percent of total costs
are expected to be financed by EAC out of internal cash generation. Of the
remaining $10 million in suppliers' credit, primarily to cover the associated
transmission and distribution works not covered by the proposed Bank project,
about $6.0 million has already been obtained and the remaining $4.0 million is
being finalized. The proposed Bank loan of $16.0 million would complete the
financing plan.



- 11 -
35.       To mitigate the debt service burden in 1980 on EAC, particularly in
view of the current high Euro-currency lending rates and consequently reduce
somewhat the need for immediate significant increases in EAC's tariffs, an
understanding was reached during negotiations that no drawdown of the Euro-
currency loan would be made by EAC during 1980, and that the CL 4.8 million
($13.9 million) expected to be required during 1980 would be covered by a
'bridging loan' to be made available by the Government to EAC by no later
than July 31, 1980, at an interest rate not exceeding 8.5 percent, and to be
utilized as and when required up to the end of 1980. This loan would be
repaid out of the Euro-currency loan during 1981. In addition, to ensure that
financing will be available to fully cover projected needs for the first two
years of the investment program, including the first year of the Bank project,
agreement was reached during negotiations that co-financing for a minimum of
$46.0 million, of which about $23.0 million still remains to be finalized,
will have been secured by no later than October 31, 1980 (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.06).
Borrower's Financial Situation
36.       EAC's financial performance was satisfactory until 1974, despite its
inability since 1964 to gain access to certain Turkish Cypriot areas in the
island and collect revenues for consumption then amounting to some 6 percent
of annual billings. Since 1974 however, unbilled consumption in northern
Cyprus increased to about 20 percent of annual billings. This loss of revenue
(estimated at about $11.0 million equivalent in 1979) has had a major adverse
impact on EAC's finances and has prevented EAC from earning the 9 percent rate
of return required under terms of the Loan Agreement for the Fourth Power
Project, despite the substantial tariff increases that have been put into
effect. The impact of this revenue loss is demonstrated by the fact that if
unbilled consumption were treated as revenue at appropriate bulk rates, EAC's
return on revalued assets would have been more than 10 percent in 1979; how-
ever in actuality, it was only about 2.7 percent. The problem of unbilled
consumption has greatly reduced EAC's ability to finance the proposed expan-
sion program from its own resources, thus requiring heavier borrowing and
placing an additional burden on its debt servicing capacity. Although EAC
still expects to finance about 39.5 percent of the program costs from its own
resources, which is substantial, EAC's overall financial situation will remain
tight.
37.       Given the continuing political stalemate, and the fact that EAC's
difficulties result from events beyond its control, the Bank has adopted a
flexible and pragmatic approach in its efforts to resolve the problem of
unbilled consumption and provide EAC with sufficient resources to finance its
expansion program without endangering its liquidity. The Bank's efforts to
seek an arrangement under which the Turkish Cypriot side would have been
provided with some transmission and distribution facilities and would have
begun to make some payments for future power consumed in the north, have not
borne fruit in the current political environment. Therefore, we have explored
possibilities of further tariff increases, as well as various forms of Govern-
ment intervention, including subsidies. Since the Government has ruled out a
direct Government subsidy to compensate EAC for its revenue losses in the
north, on the grounds that this could set an undesirable precedent for dealing



- 12 -
with other similar cases, the Government is expected to resort to additional
tariff increases sufficient to meet EAC's cash generation needs to finance the
expansion program and meet debt service requirements. Based on the above
financing plan, tariff increases of at least 7 percent effective July 1, 1980,
followed by further annual increases of 2, 3, 9 and 6 percent in January 1981
through January 1984 will likely be required.
38.       Since the existing 9 percent rate of return requirement on revalued
assets cannot, realistically, be achieved until the problem of unbilled con-
sumption in the north is resolved, which appears unlikely pending a political
settlement, it was agreed during negotiations to: (i) suspend the actual
achievement of the 9 percent rate of return until such time as the problem of
unbilled consumption can be resolved; and (ii) substitute in its place, lower
rate of return requirements which would ensure EAC's ability to generate
sufficient cash resources needed to meet its investment and debt service
requirements. Based on actual revenues to be collected, EAC would be required
to achieve on revalued assets a return of 3 percent in 1980, 4 percent in
1981, 5 percent in 1982, and 6 percent in 1983 and thereafter (Loan Agreement,
Section 5.05). To ensure EAC's ability to achieve the stipulated rates of
return, agreement was also reached with Government that it would take, by
September 30, 1980 and February 28, 1981, all actions required, including
approval of appropriate tariff increases, to enable EAC to achieve the rates
of return specified for 1980 and 1981 respectively, and to take in a timely
manner all other actions needed to enable EAC to achieve the rates of return
specified for 1982 and thereafter (Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.02). How-
ever, if EAC were to in:lude expected revenues from its unbilled consumption
in the north, at bulk sipply rates, as part of its total revenues for purposes
of calculating the rate of return, EAC would notionally be able to achieve a
rate of return of over 12 percent for the years 1980-84. In addition to the
above, EAC has confirmed that it will carry out a revaluation of its fixed
assets by August 31, 1980, and continue to do so on an annual basis for each
year thereafter.
39.       The 1972 Loan Agreement provides that EAC cannot, without the Bank's
agreement, incur any long-term debt unless its net revenues for the preceding
12 month period are not less than 1.5 times the maximum funds required to
service all outstanding long-term debt in any future year. During the period
1974-79, EAC has been unable to achieve this ratio, mainly because of its
inability to collect for power consumed in the north, and has had to obtain
the Bank's approval before incurring long-term debt. Under the present financ-
ing plan, given the heavy borrowing required, EAC's debt service coverage is
projected to fall below 1.5 to 1.3 in 1980 through 1982, but to return to and
exceed 1.5 in subsequent years. Since this lower ratio still provides a
reasonable margin of safety in respect of liquidity, it was agreed during
negotiations that EAC would not incur any long-term debt without consulting
the Bank, unless its future debt service is covered: (i) 1.3 times for each
*of the years 1980, 1981 and 1982; and (ii) 1.5 times for each year thereafter,
based on a reasonable forecast of income for each such year, before charging
depreciation (Loan Agreement, Section 5.04).

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
40.       The proposed fifth power project replaces an earlier project
appraised prior to the 1974 events, which was dropped due to the then prevail-
ing unsettled political situation and the need to review EAC's requirements
in light of the changed circumstances. Preparation and appraisal of the
proposed project was coupled with intensive efforts by the Bank and the UNDP
to make arrangements with both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sides on
a framework under which the Project could include investments on both sides of
the island. While satisfactory arrangements could have been worked out on
technical matters between EAC and KIBTEK, overall arrangements that could
ensure the success of such a project, were not possible because of the under-
lying political differences between the two sides. Nevertheless, the power
network in the island is still integrated in most respects and the increase in
EAC's generation capacity, which it is undertaking with German and Austrian
assistance, together with the proposed complementary transmission and distri-
bution facilities, would in fact supply additional power to northern and
southern Cyprus to the benefit of both communities on the island.
41.       Preparation of the project and its partial appraisal was completed
in November 1979. Final appraisal was delayed pending a final, but unsuccess-
ful, effort in February, 1980, to seek an agreement on a project including
investments in both parts of the country. Negotiations were held in Washington
April 29 to May 5, 1980. The EAC delegation was headed by Mr. Anastassiades,
EAC's General Manager and Chief Engineer. The Guarantor was represented by
Mr. Theophilou of the Ministry of Finance.
The Project
42.       The proposed project consists of a 3 year time slice of the trans-
mission and distribution portion of EAC's Expansion Program for 1980-1984,
excluding only the transmission lines and substations directly associated with
the Dhekelia Power Station. More specifically, project works comprise: (i)
28 miles of 66/132 kV double circuit overhead lines, with ten 132 kV line and
transformer bays, and four 132/11 kV transformers totalling 90 MVA and asso-
ciated switchgear: (ii) nine 66 kV line and transformer bays together with
eight 66/11 kV transformers totalling 155 MVA; (iii) 135 ground mounted dis-
tribution transformers totalling about 54 MVA and 450 pole mounted distribu-
tion transformers totalling about 45 MVA; (iv) 120 miles of 11 kV overhead
lines and 36 miles of 11 kV underground cables; (v) 270 miles of low voltage
lines and 15 miles of low voltage cables; and (vi) associated consultancy
services.
43.       The transmission system expansion and reinforcement is concentrated
in the Moni-Limassol and Paphos areas along the southern coast, where substan-
tial new investment is taking place in industry, tourism, and agriculture,
including irrigation development being financed with the Paphos and Vassilikos-
Pendaskinos Projects (Loan No.960-CY and Loan No.1658-CY respectively). Addi-
tional substation reinforcement and expansion is planned to serve increased



- 14 -
needs in the Nicosia, Larnaca and Cape Greco areas. Expansion of the distri-
bution system in these same areas includes both extension of the existing
system to serve new consumers in industry, agriculture and tourism, as well as
reinforcement of the existing system to handle expected future demand from
existing major consumers such as the industrial estates in Nicc^:a, Limassol,
Larnaca and Paphos. Details of the proposed project are given in the Loan and
Project Summary. A Staff Appraisal Report entitled "Power Transmission and
Distribution Project" (No. 2932-CY), dated May 20, 1980 is being distributed
separately.
Project Costs and Financing
44.       The estimated total project cost, including physical and price
contingencies ($7.9 million) but excluding interest during construction ($4.0
million), is about $39.6 million equivalent, of which about $24.5 million is
in foreign exchange. A physical contingency of 10 percent for both local and
foreign costs has been allowed. Price increases for local components are
based on expected cost increases of 8 percent in 1980 and 6 percent in 1981
and thereafter. Price increases for foreign components are based on expected
cost increases of 10.5 percent in 1980, 9 percent in 1981, 8 percent in 1982
and 7 percent in 1983. The proposed Bank loan of $16.0 million would cover
about 65 percent of the estimated foreign exchange costs, with an additional
$8.5 million being met out of the Euro-currency loan which is being negotiated
by the Government on behalf of EAC. All local costs and interest during
construction would be met by EAC out of its internal cash generation. EAC is
exempt from customs duties and taxes.
Project Implementation
45.       The engineering and design of all works, including preparation of
specifications and tender documents, will be undertaken by EAC's engineering
staff. However they will be assisted by consultants, especially for the
design of high voltage lines and new substations and preparation of load flow
studies in towns where transmission works are involved. About 36 man-months
of consulting services is expected to be required, with costs estimated at
$7,250 per man-month. EAC has agreed to employ such consultants on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank (Loan Agreement Section 3.02) and to appoint
by October 1, 1980 a project manager with overall responsibility for project
implementation (Loan Agreement Section 3.01(b)). The installation, supervision
of construction and putting into service of all works included in the Project
will be carried out by EAC's technical staff and own construction crews. To
further assist in supervision of the construction of the 132 (66) kV lines and
substations, EAC will engage additional experienced supervisory staff. The
project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1983.
Procurement and Disbursement
46.       All equipment and materials for the project will be procured in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines for international competitive bidding,
with the exception of small items such as fuses and low voltage insulators,
which would be procured by EAC following its own procurement practices which
are satisfactory. Civil works would be contracted locally and financed by EAC
as part of local costs. Loan funds would finance 100 percent of the foreign
costs of distribution and transmission materials and equipment, and 100 percent



- 15 -
of the foreign costs of expenditures for consultants and contracts for erection
of project works. Disbursements are expected to commence during the first
quarter of 1981.
Economic Justification and Project Risks
47.       The proposed project is part of EAC's Expansion Program, which
constitutes the least cost means of meeting Cyprus' projected growth of power
demand. Based on costs and benefits valued at domestic prices, with the
exception of fuel costs which are valued at international prices, the esti-
mated rate of return is 13 percent. In addition to existing consumers,
particularly major industries, who will benefit from increased availability of
power supplies, the major beneficiaries would be the estimated 51,000 new
customers, including about 20,000 rural consumers, who would be connected to
the power network for the first time. The Expansion Program, including the
proposed project, will also, in reality, benefit both the Greek Cypriot and
Turkish Cypriot communities.
48.       The project has no major risks, barring a major political upheaval
in Cyprus. There are also no adverse environmental effects of the project or
of the overall 1980-84 expansion program as now planned. EAC uses underground
transmission and distribution systems in most urban areas to minimize the
visual impact and would continue this approach under the proposed project.
Since the Dhekelia B station constitutes an expansion of an existing generat-
ing site in a relatively remote area on the southern coast, it will not have
any appreciable impact on the surrounding area.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Electricity Authority of Cyprus
and the Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Cyprus and
the Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. Special conditions of the project are listed in Section
3 of Annex III.
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
51.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 729 - Nicosia Sewerage Project: US$2.7 million loan of April 5,
1971. Effective Date: July 16, 1971. Closing Date: (original) March 31,
1975; (current) September 30, 1980.
The system was largely completed in July 1974 when construction was
interrupted. After prolonged negotiations, a mutually acceptable solution
was reached between the Turkish Cypriots and the Nicosia Sewage Board, and
arrangements were formally agreed upon in September 1978 to complete the
final stages of the project. Construction began again in mid 1979, with
completion planned for 1980.
Loan No. 730 - Famagusta Sewerage Project: US$1.9 million loan of April 5,
197-1.Efective Date:  July 16, 1971.  Closing Date:  (original) March3,
1975; (current) March 31, 1981.
The project was about 90 percent complete in July 1974, when con-
struction was interrupted. The project site lies entirely in Famagusta, which
is under the control of the Turkish Cypriot administration. Completion of
this project therefore depends on a political settlement. The closing date
has been extended to March 31, 1981, pending further progress towards such a
settlement.
Loan No. 904 - First Highway Project: US$5.4 million loan of June 12, 1973.
Effectilve Date:  September 12, 1973.  Closing Date:  (original) December 31,
1976; (current) June 30, 1980.
The construction element of this Loan, a new four-lane divided
Nicosia-Morphou highway, was interrupted by the events of 1974 shortly after
its start in May 1974. The Bank subsequently agreed to the Government's request to
a change of loan description that allows the use of up to US$3.6 million to
make up the foreign exchange shortfall for the construction of a new Nicosia-
Limassol highway under the Second Highway Project, Loan 1344-CY. The remaining
undisbursed funds are expected to be disbursed during 1980.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

of June 3, 1976. Effective Date: October 1, 1976. Closing Date: June 30,

be fully disbursed well before the closing date.
Loan No. 1344 - Second Highway Project: US$10.0 million loan of December 31,
1976. Effective Date: October 11, 1977. Closing Date: April 30, 1982.

on village streets is essentially completed. Work is progressing on farm
roads, on-farm water distribution systems, and land consolidation and rehabili-
tation.
Loan No. 1540 - Second Ports Project: $8.5 million loan of April 12, 1978.
Effective Date: August 11, 1978. Closing Date: June 30, 1982.

The Project Manager has been appointed and project implementation
is now getting underway. Tender documents for the major project components,
including the two multi-purpose dams have been approved and are expected to be
issued shortly. The selection process for project consultants is underway,
with the selected consultants expected to be employed by fall 1980. Overall
progress is satisfactory.

B.   The Guarantor agreed to take all necessary actions by September 30,
1980, and February 28, 1981, respectively, including approval of appropriate
tariff increases, to enable EAC to earn a rate of return of 3 percent in 1980
and 4 percent in 1981, respectively, and to take in a timely manLLer all other
steps needed to enable EAC to earn the rates of return specified for 1982 and
thereafter (para. 38).
C.   The Guarantor provided assurances that it would make available to the
Borrower by July 31, 1980, a 'bridging loan' of CL 4.8 million ($13.9 million),
at an interest rate not exceeding 8.5 percent, so as to enable the Borrower to
avoid drawing down the Euro-currency loan in 1980, thus mitigating its debt
service burden and reducing the need for large tariff increases (para. 35).
