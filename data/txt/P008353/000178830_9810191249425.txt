I. POWER AND ENERGY SECTOR
A. Energy Sector
Energy Resources
1.01      Cyprus has no known indigenous fossil fuels and no prospects for
developing any significant amount of conventional hydropower. The only
indigenous energy resources are solar and wind energy. Wind energy has
long been used to operate pumps for groundwater extraction and solar energy
has been utilized increasingly in recent years to heat water for household
use. The contribution of these sources to total energy requirements has not
been quantified, but it is not thought to be significant.
1.02      As a result of its lack of conventional energy resources, Cyprus
is dependent on imported fuel, primarily petroleum and very small quantities
of coal and coke, to meet its energy requirements. Prior to 1972 only refined
petroleum products were imported. Since then, with the establishment of its
own refinery, Cyprus has been importing both crude oil for local processing,
as well as refined products to supplement local production to the extent
necessary. In 1979 about 911,000 tons of crude oil were imported for process-
ing, as well as 510,000 tons of petroleum products including over 200,000 tons
of residual oil for power generation. Overall consumption of petroleum products
has been increasing, but the rate of increase has slowed from about 16% in 1976
to about 9% in 1978.
Energy Sector Organization
1.03      The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has general responsibility
for the energy sector working in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance
on matters concerning prices and the financing of the sector. Major policy
is framed by the Council of Ministers. The oil refinery is owned and operated
by the Cyprus Petroleum Refinery Limited, of which 50% of the shares are held
by the Government and the remaining 50% belong to Mobil (20%), Shell (15%)
and BP (15%). Public electricity supply is the responsibility of the Govern-
ment-owned Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC), created by law in 1952 for
the purpose of generating and supplying electricity.
Energy Policy
1.04      In view of the almost complete dependence of the economy on imported
fuels to meet its energy needs, Government energy policy emphasizes (i) energy
conservation, particularly to limit as much as possible the impact of increas-
ingly costly oil imports on its balance of payments, and (ii) the study and
promotion of alternatives, including increased utilization of limited local
energy sources, especially solar energy, and the possible use of coal. With
these objectives in mind, the Government is carrying out a study, with UNDP
assistance, to determine energy conservation measures and criteria and examine
the development of non-traditional energy sources. The Government has also
established an Energy Advisory Board to study einergy issues and make recom-
mendations to the Government on energy matters.  In addition, a number of
steps to restrict gasoline consumption have been taken including keeping



- 2 -
prices of gasoline higher than prices of other petroleum products, and
restricting the week-end use of private vehicles on an odd-even basis.
Further conservation measures are under consideration, such as gasoline
rationing, parking restrictions in city centers and increased vehicle taxes.
In addition the Government is also considering steps to promote and develop
public transportation.
B. Power Subsector
Background
1.05      The Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC) was formed by the integra-
tion of some 16 separate local power enterprises. Since its establishment,
EAC has acquired control of all public power supplies, erected two steam
generating stations, one at Dhekelia and one at Moni, both on the southern
coast of Cyprus. It has also established a nation-wide transmission and
distribution system serving all major population centers, including all
villages in south Cyprus as of 1979.
1.06      Following the 1974 events, and resulting defacto division of the
island into the Government controlled southern part and Turkish Cypriot
controlled northern part, EAC has had no access to transmission and other
facilities in the north, which are being operated by the Turkish Cypriot Electricitv
Authority (KIBTEK), established in 1975 by the Turkish Cypriots for this
purpose. EAC has, however, continued to supply power to the north, even
though it is unable to collect payment for power consumed by the Turkish
Cypriots. This problem of unbilled consumption, and the resulting loss of
revenue (about US$11 million equivalent in 1979) has had a serious impact on
EAC's finances and constitutes the major issue affecting the power subsector
(paras. 1.17 and 1.18).
Organization of the EAC
1.07      EAC is governed by a Board consisting of a Chairman, a Vice-Chairman
and five members, all of whom are appointed by the Council of Ministers for a
five-year term. The present Chairman is a lawyer who served previously as
Vice-Chairman of the Board. The Board appoints the Chief Executive officer of
EAC, the General Manager. The present General Manager, who also holds the
post of Chief Engineer, has been associated with EAC for many years, and is
due for retirement at the end of the year. No difficulties are expected to
arise as a result of his retirement.
1.08      At present most of EAC's operations are centralized at its head
office in Nicosia with three regional offices primarily handling distribution
system operations including accounting and customer services. Accounting
operations were introduced at the regional level in 1978 following the
recommendations of a study of EAC's organization and management done by the
South of Scotland Electricity Board. Annex 1.1 shows the present organization
of EAC.



- 3 -
1.09      At the end of 1979, EAC's permanent staff totalled 1,435 and was
comprised of 130 professional engineers, 8 professional accounting and admin-
istrative staff, 276 accounting, administrative and clerical staff, 54 meter
readers and collectors, 625 skilled technical staff, and 342 semi-skilled and
unskilled staff. The present staffing is adequate. EAC's plans to progres-
sively increase its staff by about 11%, as required by its 1980-84 system
expansion program.
Training
1.10      EAC promotes the upgrading of its experienced staff through sub-
sidized courses and the training of technical school graduates as technicians
on an apprenticeship basis. It also arranges special overseas training; in
1979,4 senior staff members attended 4 international conferences and seminars
and 2 staff members went on education visits to forei-n power companies. The
training program is adequate for EAC's needs.
Existing Facilities
1.11      EAC's existing generating capacity totals 264 MW from two steam
power stations located at Dhekelia and Moni on the southern coast of the
island, as shown on the attached Map (IBRD 14983). The Dhekelia station
capacity is 84 MW, with two 7-MW and five 14-MW units. The units were
installed during the period 1953-1963, and have been well maintained (all
but one turbine rotor have been rebladed). The station's thermal efficiency
is about 22%, which is quite reasonable for such small units. The Moni
station was designed on a modular basis and the thermal efficiency is about
28%, reflecting the improved characteristics of the larger and more modern
sets. The first Moni 30-MW unit was commissioned in 1966, followed by five
additional units, giving a total station capacity of 180 MW. Since 1974,
KIBTEK has installed a 30-MW gas turbine unit in the north and has another
similar unit under construction. However, except for short periods of occa-
sional start-up and testing, KIBTEK has not put this unit into operation,
probably because of the high cost of fuel and the lack of foreign exchange in
northern Cyprus. It is not clear whether this additional capacity can be
considered as an effective reserve. The only other power facilities in Cyprus
are small diesel standby sets at industrial plants, hospitals, communication
centers and airfields; and a small combined desalination power installation at
one of the two UK bases. The total capacity of these diesel standby units is
about 10 MW.
1.12      The EAC transmission system comprises 78 circuit miles of 132-kV
lines, 6 circuit miles of 132-kV underground cable, 188 circuit miles of
132-kV lines operated at 66 kV, 370 circuit miles of 66-kV lines, and 452 MVA
of 132/11-kV and 66/11-kV stepdown transformer station capacity. Most new
lines built over the past decade were built for 132 kV but operate at 66 kV.
EAC uses 11 kV for all primary distribution lines and has in service some
1,704 miles of overhead circuits, 309 miles of underground cables, and 483-MVA
distribution transformer capacity. Its low voltage grid extends to about
2,361 miles of overhead lines and 123 miles of underground cables. The
central areas of the cities are served by underground cables. Since 1974,



- 4 -
KIBTEK has added about 30 miles of 66-kV lines, extended and reinforced the
II-kV and low voltage system, including the II-kV underground system in the
Turkish Cypriot part of Nicosia, and extended the low voltage grid to about
25 villages in the north.
1.13      Over the past decade the rural electricity supply in Cyprus has
been greatly expanded and as of December 1979, all villages in south Cyprus
had access to electricity.
Operations
1.14      EAC has an installed capacity of 264  MW with a firm capacity of
234 MW. The highest peak load occurring to date was 194 MW recorded in
December 1979. Plant and facilities appear to be properly maintained, although
a few incidents caused by bad weather have resulted in forced outages of plant
for short periods. The system as a whole has a very satisfactory reliability
record.
1.15      Generating station energy consumption averages about 4.7% of the
energy generated, with transmission losses averaging about 3.5%, which is
reasonable. Distribution losses in 1979 averaged about 6.3%, which is not
excessive. The system load factor was 58% in 1978 and 57.5% in 1979 and is
expected to remain about the same for the next few years.
1.16      EAC's personnel do not have access to the transmission and distribu-
tion facilities in the north. Similarly, the Turkish Cypriots do not have
access to the system in the south. The lack of access, especially in the
areas along the present cease fire line, has created difficulties in load
forecasting and inhibited maintenance of commonly used facilities. Thus,
faults have not been cleared with the usual diligence, and only indispensible
repairs have been made.
Unbilled Consumption
1.17      EAC's most serious operational problem, which undermines its finan-
cial performance, and for which no solution is in sight, is its inability to
secure payment for consumption in the northern Turkish Cypriot area. This
problem existed even before 1974, although on a much less serious scale, when
following the civil disturbances of 1964, the Company was unable to gain
access to customers in Turkish Cypriot enclaves to collect revenues for
electricity consumption in those areas, then amounting to about 6% of annual
billings. Since 1974, the problem has been aggravated considerably and the
unbilled consumption in the Turkish Cypriot areas is presently about 20% of
EAC's annual generation. The extent to which such unbilled consumption
affects EAC's finances can be seen from the following: in 1979, unbilled
consumption was valued at CL 3.9 million or 171% of its operating profit for
the year. The total amount of unbilled consumption since 1974, as of December
31, 1979, was estimated at CL 14.9 millin, the equivalent of US$43 million.
1.18      The problem of unbilled consumption is part of a broader political
problem which can only be resolved within the context of a more general
settlement between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Until such an overall



-5-
settlement takes place, there appears to be no escape from the present state
of affairs. Despite intensive efforts, the Bank has also not been successful
in getting the two sides to reach agreement on some method of payment for
electricity consumption in the Turkish Cypriot areas.
Electricity Tariffs
1.19      Under the Electricity Development Law of 1952, EAC is free to
determine the level and structure of its tariffs subject to approval by
the Council of Ministers. The guiding principles are that revenues should
be sufficient to meet operation expenses and debt service and to generate
funds for system expansion.
1.20      Standard tariffs became effective on the 1st of July 1953 and
remained unchanged until early 1974 when the effect of oil price increases
started to be felt. Since then, rates have been revised 4 times to meet
higher operating costs (primarily fuel costs) and to partially compensate
for the sales in the north for which revenue cannot be collected. A tariff
study carried out by consultants, British Electricity International, in 1977
recommended a gradual move towards full cost recovery to be implemented over
a period of five years. Based on its recommendations, the tariff structure
was modified and the tariffs increased bv an average of 12% in September 1978.
In addition an automatic fuel cost adjustment clause has been introduced.
Sales
1.21      As a result of the 1974 events, the consumption of electricity
dropped an average of 7.9%. However, consumption in the south picked up
quickly and exceeded the pre-1974 level by the end of 1976. Since the end of
1975, consumption of electricity in the south has increased by an average of
9.5% annually. Turkish Cypriot consumption has been increasing at an esti-
mated average of 8.8% per year. The extent to which demand for electricity
is elastic to price change is difficult to determine. Indeed, total sales
increased by 8% in 1979 despite an average 12% rate increase in September
1978, and the very high cost of fuel oil prevailing in the second half of 1979
that was passed on to consumers through the fuel price adjustment clause. The
growth in energy sold appears to be more related to the increase in the number
of consumers (6.36% in 1979 and 7.2% in 1978) and largely unaffected by the
increase in tariffs.

1.22      The pattern of sales to customers in the south is as follows:
EAC's 1979 Sales in South Cyprus
Number of Customers      Total Sales   Average Price
Class                 as of 12/31/79          GWh        %    CYP. Mils/kWh
Domestic                  134,677              175.2    25.7       25.37
Commercial                  24,449             209.3    30.7       28.54
Industrial                   6,283             241.0    35.3       25.54
Irrigation                   1,433              38.5      5.6      19.99
Street Lighting              1,280              18.6      2.7      25.00
Total   168,122              682.8   100.0       26.09
In addition, and according to EAC's estimates, 196.3 GWh were supplied to
KIBTEK.
1.23      Based on 1978 figures (1979 figures were not available) KIBTEK
serves about 45,000 consumers, of which about 80% are domestic, 14% commer-
cial, 3% industrial, 2% irrigation and 1% street lighting. According to
KIBTEK, the north received 148 GWh in 1978, of which about 62% was utilized
for domestic consumption, 17% for commercial, 14% industry, 3% irrigation and
4% street lighting. The maximum demand was reported to be about 42 MVA.
Bank Participation in the Power Sector
1.24      The Bank has been closely involved in EAC's development since the
early 1960's, having made a total of four loans to assist in financing the
construction and expansion of the Moni Power Station and related transmission
and distribution facilities. (Loan 335-CY for US$21.0 million in 1963, of
which only US$16.4 million disbursed due to cost savings; Loan 494-CY for
US$2.8 million in 1967, of which only US$2.3 million disbursed due to cost
savings; Loan 649-CY for US$5.0 million in 1969; and Loan 831-CY for US$9.0
million in 1972.) Through these four loans the Bank has been able to promote
and encourage substantial institution-building, which has helped EAC develop
into a modern, and sophisticated (though small) utility. The Bank introduced
international competitive bidding to EAC and thereby effected substantial
savings on early projects as a result of which this plrocedure is now followed
by EAC for most of its procurement. All four projects were completed satis-
factorily. A Project Performance Audit Report No. 2259, covering the Fourth
Power Project was circulated to the Executive Directors on November 9, 1978.
It confirms the satisfactory execution of the project and satisfactory per-
formance of the Borrower, EAC, although it also notes the increasing financial
difficulties faced by EAC as a result of its inability to receive payment for
power supplied to the Turkish Cypriot consumers.
1.25      A fifth power project, including electrification of the remaining
villages and system rehabilitation in the Turkish Cypriot areas was appraised
in May/June 1974, but was subsequently dropped following the 1974 division of
the island. There still remains a need to rehabilitate and extend the power



- 7 -
system facilities now operated by the Turkish Cypriot side but the Bank's
attempts in this direction have not been successful due to political con-
siderations.
II. EAC'S 1980-1984 EXPANSION PROGRAM
Background
2.01      Preparation of EAC's expansion program was initiated before 1974
and subsequently updated and modified to reflect the current situation.
The decision to proceed with the modified program was taken by EAC in 1978,
based on recommendations of its consultants. The expansion program was
further reviewed by the Government, EAC and the Bank as a result of which it
was scaled down to its present size to make it more financially manageable for
EAC. Even so, it is the most ambitious expansion program ever undertaken by
EAC, both in terms of its size and its financial requirements. Nevertheless,
given EAC's past performance and existing staff capabilities, it should
be able to implement the program satisfactorily.
Program Description and Costs
2.02      EAC's expansion program for the period 1980-1984 comprises:
(i) the installation of two 60-MW oil-fired steam units,
adjacent to the existing Dhekelia power station, the
new plant to be called Dhekelia'B"and to come into
service in 1982/83 as a new base load plant;
(ii) the expansion and reinforcement of the existing trans-
mission system; and
(iii) the extension and reinforcement of the ll-kV and low
voltage distribution networks in towns and rural areas.
A detailed description of the 1980-1984 program is shown in Annex 2.1.
Annex 2.2 shows in tabular form the existing facilities and the planned
additions under the program. The financial requirements of the program
are summarized below, and a breakdown of costs on a year by year basis is
given in Annex 2.3.

III. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01      The Bank-financed Project would comprise all the transmission
and distribution systems expansion and improvements to be undertaken during
the three year period 1981-83, except for the 132-kV Dhekelia-Athalassa O/H
line and substation modifications associated with Dhekelia "B" power station.
It would also include related consulting engineering services.
3.02      The works to be installed as part of the proposed Project include
the following:
Transmission Facilities
(i) 28 miles of 132 (66)-kV double circuit overhead lines serving
substations at Polemidhia, Ayia Phyla and Yermasoyia;
(ii) 10 - 132-kV line and transformer bays at Ayia Phyla, Yermasoyia
and Polemidhia substations;
(iii)  4 - 132/11-kV transformers totalling 90 MVA and associated
switchgear at Ayia Phyla, Yermasoyia substations;
(iv) 9 - 66-kV line and transformer bays at Moni, Polemidhia and
Orounda substations; and
(v) 8 - 66/11-kV transformers totalling 95 MVA to be installed
at Pyrgos, Paphos, Polemidhia, Mari and Athalassa substations.



- 9
Distribution Facilities
(i)  135 ground mounted distribution transformer totalling about
54 MVA and 450 pole mounted distribution transformers totalling
about 45 MVA;
(ii)  120 miles of 11 kV overhead lines and 36 miles of 11 kV under-
ground cables; and
(iii)  270 miles of low voltage lines and 15 miles of low voltage
cables.
The above distribution components will be installed to expand and reinforce
EAC's distribution system throughout south Cyprus.
Project Costs
3.03      Annex 2.3 integrates Project costs into the total investment program
on a year by year basis. Project costs are summarized in the following table

- 10 -
3.04      Project costs are based on EAC estimates, with base costs in mid-1980
prices. A physical contingency of 10% for both local and foreign costs has
been added to allow for quantity uncertainties and design changes during
implementation. Allowances of 10.5% in 1980, 9% in 1981, 8% in 1982 and 7% in
1983 have been added for future escalation of foreign costs in accordance with
current estimates of expected international price trends. Allowance for local
price contingencies has been made at the rate of 8% in 1980 and 6% in 1981 and
thereafter.
Project Financing
3.05      The proposed US$16.0 million Bank loan would finance about 65.0%
of the foreign exchange costs of the Project estimated at US$24.5 million.
The remaining 35% of the foreign exchange costs, estimated at about US$8.5
million, excluding interest during construction, are expected to be financed
out of the Euro-currency loan being raised by EAC as part of the financing for
its 1980-84 program (paras. 4.08 and 4.09). EAC will finance all local costs
estimated at US$15.1 million equivalent and interest during construction
(about US$4.0 million) out of internal cash generation. The proposed financing
plan is summarized below:

Project Implementation
3.06      (a) Engineering:  The overall responsibility for the engineering
and design of all works included in the Project would be undertaken by EAC's
engineering staff, which is well qualified and experienced. Services of
consultants would be used (i) in connection with the design of high voltage
transmission lines and new substations; (ii) to prepare load flow studies
in system reinforcement in towns where transmission works are involved; and
(iii) to assist in the preparation of specifications and tender documents.
The in-factory inspection of equipment and materials would be carried out
by consultants or EAC's staff. EAC would continue to employ consultants on
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.



- 11 -
(b) Project Execution: The installation, supervision of construc-
tion and putting into service of the transmission and distribution works
included in the Project would be carried out by EAC's technical staff and own
construction crews. With regard to the 132 (66)-kV lines and substations for
which EAC has less experience, EAC will contract for the necessary supervisory
personnel with qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank and
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. EAC will also acquire
through purchase or lease, the necessary construction and testing equipment
needed. A Project Manager responsible for execution of the Project would be
appointed by October 1, 1980 and this appointment may be made from amongst the
existing staff of EAC. Project implementation schedules are provided in Annex
3.2. The expected completion date would be December 31, 1983.
Procurement
3.07      Excluding small items such as low voltage fuses and insulators which
would be procured by EAC following its own procurement practices which are
satisfactory, International Competitive Bidding, in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines, would be used for all other procurement of Bank-financed items.
Procurement contracts would include appropriate provisions that suppliers
perform inspection and supervision of installation during project implementa-
tion. Bank financed contracts would cover all imported materials and equip-
ment, and foreign costs of installation and consultants' services included in
the Project. EAC is exempt from customs duties and taxes. Civil works would
be contracted locally and financed as part of local costs.
Disbursements
3.08      The proposed Bank loan of US$16.0 million would be disbursed over
a 3-year period on the following basis:
(a)  100% of foreign expenditures on imported equipment and materials
included in Bank-financed contracts;
(b)  100% of foreign expenditures on installation contracts and con-
sultants' services.
The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Annex 3.3. The closing
date would be June 30, 1984.
Environmental Aspects
3.09      There are no adverse environmental effects of the Project or the
overall 1980-84 program as planned. EAC is using underground transmission
and distribution systems in most urban areas to minimize the visual impact
of the power facilities and it would continue this approach with the planned
expansion of its network. Since the Dhekelia "B" station constitutes an
expansion of an existing generating site in a relatively remote area on the
southern coast, it will not have any appreciable impact on the surrounding
area. The EAC would take all necessary measures to ensure that the Dhekelia
"B" station observes acceptable flue gas emission standards.

IV. FINANCE
Accounts
4.01      EAC has a well-organized accounting department and an efficient,
computerized accounting and management information system.  Billing and
collection, inventory control, personnel records and all accounting functions
are computerized. Accounting work is decentralized in three regional offices
with their own budget and accounting staff. Tight control is exercised over
all expenses and financial statements are prepared every two months for
management purposes. In a departure from past practice, EAC proposes to
capitalize interest during construction from 1980 onwards.
Billing
4.02      EAC's billing arrangements are satisfactory and its accounts receiv-
able for electricity supply, excluding the unbilled consumption in the north,
are within acceptable limits. With the exception of some 870 large consumers
whose meters are read monthly, meters are read cyclically at two month inter-
vals and bills are processed by computer. Bills are sent to consumers
by mail and settlement is required within 18 days of mailing.
Taxes and Duties
4.03      EAC is not liable to pay sales taxes, municipal taxes or import
duties. Though theoretically liable for income taxes, actually it does not
pay any income taxes because of the system of tax allowances for investment
which effectively offsets its tax liability, and the provision for carrying
forward losses against future taxable profits without time limitation.
Revaluation of Assets
4.04      Periodic revaluation of assets is necessary to ensure that EAC's
rate of return is based on current costs. For this purpose, EAC would use
an annual coefficient based on the general wholesale price index published
by the Government, which reflects changes in construction costs in the
country. EAC would carry out, by August 31, 1980, a revaluation of its
fixed assets as of December 31, 1979, based on the methodology given in
Annex 4.9. Thereafter, EAC would submit to the Bank its accounts and financial
statements for the subsequent years as revalued in accordance with this
methodology and duly audited by its auditors.
Past Performance and Present Position of EAC
4.05      Loan 831-CY requires EAC to earn a rate of return of at least 9% on
average net fixed assets in operation as revalued from time to time. In a
period of relatively stable prices when a high proportion of the assets had
been added in the recent past, it was accepted that assets need not be
revalued. On this basis, EAC complied with this covenant up to 1974, even
though it faced the problem of unbilled consumption in Turkish Cypriot



- 13 -
areas (para. 1.17). EAC's tariffs remained unchanged, despite rising costs
from 1952 to March 1974 when a 50% increase was necessary to offset the
late 1973 oil price increases. Following the 1974 disturbances, EAC's strong
financial position was severely eroded primarily on account of unbilled
consumption, despite a 43.5% increase in EAC's average revenue per kWh sold
during 1975-79 largely through the introduction of a fuel adjustment charge in
May 1977 to recover fuel cost increases and an average 12% tariff increase
effective September 1978.
4.06      As a result of insufficient earnings, EAC has resorted to increased
borrowings since 1974. In 1975, EAC had a negative net internal cash genera-
tion and during 1976-1979 its debt service coverage never exceeded 1.0,
reflecting an unsatisfactory financial condition. EAC's debt/equity ratio
ranged from 35/65 to 45/55 during 1975-79.
4.07      In addition, EAC was unable to meet the rate of return covenant
during the period 1975-79 when the return on unrevalued assets was nil in
1975, 2.5% in 1976, 2.8% in 1977, 5.7% in 1978 and 5.5% in 1979. The corre-
sponding rate of return on revalued assets was less than 1% for 1975-1977 and
2.7% in 1978 and 1979. However, if the unbilled consumption were treated as
part of EAC's revenues, the return on unrevalued assets would have been 10.2%
in 1975, 13.2% in 1976, 15.2% in 1977, 17.9% in 1978 and 21.2% in 1979. The
corresponding rate of return on revalued assets would have been 4.2% in 1975,
6.0% in 1976, 7.0% in 1977, 8.4% in 1978 and 10.2% in 1979. After four
consecutive years of losses in 1974-77, EAC earned a net profit after interest
of CL 159,000 in 1978, as a result of the tariff increases. However, it again
incurred a loss in 1979 (CL 22,000) largely because the value of unbilled
consumption in the north rose 31% and there were no additional tariff increases.
Financing Plan
4.08      In developing an appropriate financing plan for its investment
program for 1980-84, EAC has to maintain a fine balance between its internal
cash generation and borrowings with the objectives of maximizing internal cash
generation and of restraining borrowings to the minimum so as not to endanger
its liquidity. Such a financing plan has been agreed with Government and EAC,
which would involve tariff increases of at least 7% effective July 1, 1980, 2%
effective January 31, 1981 and 3%, 9% and 6% effective in January 1982, 1983
and 1984, respectively. The forecast of sources and application of funds of
EAC for the period 1980-1984 based on the agreed financing plan is given in
Annex 4.3. A condensed version for the same period is given below:

4.09      It will be seen from the above table that EAC's investment program
for 1980-84 amounts to CL 54.6 million which will be financed 39.5% from
internal cash generation and 60.5% from borrowings. The level of internal
cash generation is satisfactory, particularly since EAC is supplying 20%
of its total output to the north without payment. Of the total borrowing
requirement estimated at US$95.8 million equivalent, US$16 million would be
from the proposed Bank loan, about US$41.8 million from suppliers' credits and
German capital assistance and about US$38 million from an Euro-currency loan.
Of the suppliers' credits, US$38.0 million has already been secured from West
German, Austrian, British and other sources at rates of interest varying from
4.5-6% with maturity periods from 7-20 years including on the average 3 years
of grace; the remaining suppliers' credit of US$3.8 million is in the process
of being finalized. As regards the proposed Euro-currency loan (interest rate:
in early May around 20%) EAC has already obtained a commitment in principle
for the loan, which is expected to be finalized within 3 months. To mitigate
its debt service burden in 1980, EAC would not draw-down any of the Euro-
currency loan during 1980 and the CL 4.8 million expected to be required
by it during 1980 would be covered from a "bridging loan" that would be made
available to it by the Government no later than July 31, 1980, at an interest
rate not exceeding 8.5%, and to be utilized as and when required up to



- 15 -
December 31, 1980. EAC would repay this loan out of the Euro-currency loan,
or if possible, from internally generated cash during 1981. In view of the
heavy interest charges, EAC would limit its Euro-currency loan to the equivalent
of CL 13.1 million planned at present. The agreed financing plan is reasonably
firm and is satisfactory. It would ensure that EAC maintains a debt service
coverage of a minimum of 1.3 during 1980-1982 and 1.5 in 1983 and thereafter,
an acceptable coverage in the circumstances in which EAC operates. In order
to ensure that sufficient financing is available for the first two years of
the program, EAC would secure by October 31, 1980 from the co-financiers, an
aggregate amount of no less than US$46 million (of which about US$23 million
remains to be finalized) for the financing of this program in 1980 and 1981.
Future Performance
4.10      Based on the tariff increases mentioned in para. 4.08, EAC's rate
of return on revalued assets without taking into account the value of the
unbilled consumption in the north, would be about 3.0% in 1980, 4.0% in 1981,
5.0% in 1982, 6.0% in 1983 and 6.0% in 1984. While the present political
situation prevails, the rate of return covenant under Loan 831-CY would be
suspended; instead, through tariff adjustment and other measures, EAC would
achieve at least the above rates of return in 1980-1984 and a minimum of 6%
thereafter. The Government would take all action required, including approval
of tariff adjustments, by September 30, 1980 and February 28, 1981 to enable
EAC to achieve the returns for 1980 and 1981 respectively. Taking into
account the value of the unbilled consumption, which would continue to be
measured or determined by EAC, based on an appropriate bulk supply rate, the
rate of return on revalued assets corresponding to the above figures would be
12.3% in 1980, 13.8% in 1981, 12.9% in 1982, 12.8% in 1983 and 13.0% in 1984.
4.11      As a result of tariff increases proposed in para. 4.08 and of
revaluation reserves, EAC's debt/equity ratio would improve during the Project
period from 45/55 at the end of 1979 to 22/78 at the end of 1984. EAC's
current ratio which was 1.2 at the end of 1978 fell to 0.9 at the end of
1979 and would remain below 1.0 through 1984, reflecting a tight liquidity
position. The situation would improve thereafter.
Debt Service Covenant
4.12      Under Loan 831-CY, EAC agreed to obtain the Bank's prior consent
to any borrowing it plans to undertake whenever its internal cash generation
is not sufficient to cover at least 1.5 times its debt service requirements
in any future year. During the period 1974-1979 EAC has not been able to
achieve this ratio, on account of its inability to collect 20% of its total
revenues from consumers in the north, and has had to obtain the Bank's approval
before incurring long-term debt.
4.13      During negotiations EAC agreed not to incur long-term debt, without
consulting the Bank, unless its future debt service is (i) for each of the
years 1980, 1981 and 1982 covered 1.3 times, and (ii) for each year thereafter
covered 1.5 times, by a reasonable forecast of net income in such year, before
charging depreciation.



- 16 -
Audit
4.14      Under Loan 831-CY, EAC's financial statements are to be audited
by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and submitted to the Bank
within five months after the end of each fiscal year. EAC has for several
years employed Price Waterhouse Associates as its external auditors, who have
performed satisfactorily, and the audited statements have been regularly
submitted to the Bank on time. The existing covenant would be repeated in
the proposed loan. EAC also has a well-organized internal audit section with
direct access to the General Manager. It scrutinizes payments, periodically
checks the accounts of large consumers, and verifies the physical inventories.
Insurance
4.15      EAC's insurance arrangements are satisfactory.  It is insured with
leading insurance companies in Cyprus and Lloyd's of London against risks of
fire, explosion, and theft of or damage to inventories. It carries its own
risks in respect of breakdown of machinery and electrical damage, which is
satisfactory, considering its high operation and maintenance standards.
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Load Forecast
5.01      In view of the unsettled political situation, load growth in Cyprus
has been very eratic, making it very difficult to establish reliable fore-
casts. In attempting to predict its future power requirements, EAC uses a
method based on historical trends showing maximum demand in MW over a seven
year period. The weakness of this method is that it does not allow for the
impact of unexpected changes in the social and/or economic environment, since
it assumes that future demand will be similar to the demand during the pre-
vious seven years. It also assumes that part of the island, currently under
the control of the Turkish Cypriots, will develop with the same growth pattern
as the southern part. Nevertheless, given the uncertainty of the political
situation and the resulting difficulty of forecasting loads on a reliable
basis, EAC's forecasts are considered acceptable, although probably somewhat
optimistic, given the expected slower growth of the economy in the south,
and the existing economic stagnation in the north. In addition, in the
unlikely event that the north would decide on its own to generate all its own
electricity needs, the system would have enough excess capacity to meet the
needs of the south until 1990.
5.02      Details of current EAC projections are shown in Annex 5.1.  They
show for the period 1979 through 1990, an average annual growth rate of
about 8% through 1984 and an average rate of about 7% thereafter. Maximum
demand is projected to increase from 194 MW in 1979 to 296 MW in 1984 and
320 MW in 1985.

Least Cost Alternatives
5.03      With the assistance of its consultants (Preece, Cardew and Rider,
(PCR) of the UK) EAC considered several alternative schemes for the generation
part of its 1980-84 development program. The different schemes based on dif-
ferent combinations of generation programs, were costed and a present worth
analysis performed to ascertain, in conjunction with the load forecast, which
alternative presents the least cost to the EAC. The scheme retained in EAC's
expansion program is in accordance with the conclusions and recommendations
of the study and the final decision to proceed with an oil-fired steam plant
was taken by the EAC in mid-1978.
5.04      The study did not consider any fuel source other than oil, largely
because the analysis took place well before the latest round of oil price
increases. Subsequent to the recent price increases, EAC decided that it
would be too costly, both in terms of time and further delays in meeting
projected power demand, to stop the project at this point and study the
feasibility of using coal, especially since tenders for the generators and
boilers had already been issued in the fall of 1978 and contracts concluded.
Moreover, conversion to coal would require a substantial change of boiler
design with loss of efficiency. It would also require other investments since
the plant site at Dhekelia has no port facilities and there is no rail connec-
tion to Dhekelia from the nearest major port of Limassol, which also has no
coal handling facilities. In view of this, it would not be appropriate to
delay implementation of the investment program pending the outcome of a study
concerning the alternative ability to burn coal. However, since the Govern-
ment's current policies in regard to energy use include efforts to limit and
even reduce consumption of oil and to explore alternative energy sources,
including coal, EAC would carry out by December 31, 1982, a detailed study of
the feasibility of future use of coal for the Dhekelia station, and for the
use of coal for the further expansion of its power generation system. The
study would include an assessment of the environmental impact of the use of
coal, having regard to the importance of tourism for Cyprus.
5.05      The transmission and distribution components of the investment
program are the minimum requirements needed to meet the load growth from
existing and new consumers. The transmission component is also based on a
least-cost analysis undertaken by EAC's consultants (PCR). The distribution
component is based on "minimum cost" standardized designs for such works which
EAC has developed over many years.
Internal Economic Return
5.06      The Project constitutes a significant part of EAC's Least Cost
Development Program for the development of its transmission and distribution
networks. It covers about 37% of the foreign cost of the transmission equip-
ment and about 40% of the foreign cost of the distribution equipment; both
being essential for the transport of electricity from the new generating plant
to the major demand centers and its delivery to the consumers (paras. 2.02
and 3.03). The benefits associated with transmission and distribution
projects cannot be isolated from the benefits attributable to an integrated



- 18 -
system. Consequently, the economic rate of return on the Project is approxi-
mated by the return on EAC's 1980-84 development program whose benefits would
not materialize without the Project.
5.07      The economic rate of return on the investment in the program is
12.7% (Annex 5.2). This return is based on costs and benefits valued
at domestic prices, except for the cost of fuels whose border prices were
readily available.l/ The benefits include: (a) the revenue from the sale of
electricity which was based on an average tariff of 43.3 mils/kWh taken as a
proxy for the consumers' willingness to pay; (b) fuel savings accruing from
the retirement of the existing less-efficient generating plant (Dhekelia A)
and replacing it with the new plant included in the development program
(Dhekelia B); and (c) the net savings accruing to rural consumers from the
substitution of electricity for kerosene. The costs encompass: (a) the cost
of the development program; (b) the operations and maintenance cost; and (c)
the cost of fuel oil that would be used for power generation.
5.08      The IERR indicates that, on the average, the tariff level is ade-
quate in conveying to consumers the cost to the economy of the resources used
in meeting their demand for electricity. However, because of the current
political setting of Cyprus, the consumers in the south would have to continue
to pay financial tariffs that are higher than the economic tariffs in order to
cover part of the cost of electricity transmitted to the north for which EAC
receives no financial compensation.
Risks
5.09      The project has no major risks, except for the possible impact of
major political changes in Cyprus. In the event such changes would enable the
northern part to meet its own power requirements, the investment program would
be oversized for the southern area alone.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      Government will:
(a) take, by September 30, 1980 and February 28, 1981, all
actions required on its part to enable EAC to achieve
the agreed rates of return for 1980 and 1981 respectively
(para. 4.10); and
1/   Fuel oil was valued at US$180/ton and kerosene US$345/ton.  The rest of
the costs and benefits were not expressed in their respective equiva-
lent border prices because the conversion factors for shadow pricing are
not available. This, however, is not expected to have a significant
impact on the value of the ERR because the market in Cyprus operates
under conditions which are fairly close to those of the purely competitive
market.



- 19 -
(b) make available to EAC no later than July 1, 1980, a
bridging loan in the amount of CL 4.8 million at an
interest rate not exceeding 8.5%, representing the
expected draw-down that would have been necessary
on the Euro-currency loan for 1980 (para. 4.09).
6.02      EAC will:
(a) employ consultants for engineering and Project
execution on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank (paras. 3.06(a) and 3.07);
(b) appoint by October 1, 1980, a project manager
responsible for supervising the execution of
the Project (para. 3.06(b));
(c)  carry out, by August 31, 1980, a revaluation of
its fixed assets as of December 31, 1979, and
thereafter submit to the Bank its accounts and
financial statements as revalued and duly audited
by its auditors (para. 4.04);
(d) secure by October 31, 1980 from co-financiers an
aggregate amount of no less than US$46 million
equivalent for the financing of its program in
1980 and 1981 (para. 4.09);
(e) achieve minimum rates of return on revalued assets
of 3% in 1980, 4% in 1981, 5% in 1982 and 6%
thereafter (para. 4.10);
(f) maintain a debt service coverage of at least 1.3
through 1982 and 1.5 thereafter (para. 4.13);
(g) carry out by December 31, 1982 a detailed study
of the feasibility of conversion of fuel source
from oil to coal for its Dhekelia "B" power station
and future plants (para. 5.04),
6.03      The audit provisions under Loan 831-CY would be extended to the
proposed loan.
6.04      In view of the agreement on the matters set forth in this report,
the Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$16 million to EAC, with the
guarantee of the Republic of Cyprus, with a term of 15 years including 3 years
of grace. The loan is expected to become effective within 90 days of signing.

POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Description of the 1980-84 Program
I. Dhekelia "B" Station
The new Dhekelia "B" station will consist of 2 x 60 MW steam units,
each comprising a 260 tons per hours oil-fired boiler, a 60 MW turbo-generator,
and associated auxiliaries and electrical equipment. The plant is to be built
as an extension to the existing station at Dhekelia.
II. Transmission System
The main items of the transmission system extensions are:
ti) transmission line between Dhekelia and Athalassa with interbus
transformers at Dhekelia. This line is associated with the proposed
Dhekelia "B" Power Station and vill be used to transmit bulk energy
to the Athalassa substation;
(ii)  transmission system extensions and reinforcement in the Moni-
Limassol - Paphos areas are required to meet increased demand
resulting from industrial, tourism and agriculture investments,
including irrigation projects financed by the Bank;
(iii)  the establishment of the Yermasoyia and Ayia Phyla 132/11 kV sub-
stations and uprating of the Polemidhia substation to 132 kV to meet
load growth stemming from tourism and industrial investments in the
Limassol area, as well as increasing domestic demand;
(iv)  the Moni-Pyrgos-Mari transmission line reinforcement and the estab-
lishment of a new substation at Mari to meet the increase in demand
from industrial development in this area. Demand from the existing
Cement Plant will increase from about 6 MW to 32 MW by 1984. The
present 2 MVA demand from the local radio station is expected to
reach 6 MVA by 1983;
(v)  the establishment of the Alambra and Kophinou 66/11 kV substations,
and reinforcement of the Athalassa 66/11 kV substation are required
to meet industrial, domestic water supply and irrigation loads in
these areas. The Vassilikos-Pendaskinos Water Resources Development
and Nicosia Water Supply Projects are expected to have an ultimate
demand on the order of 3 MVA;
(vi) reinforcement of the Sotera and Cape Creco substations, which is
required' to meet increased demand from tourism;

ANNEX 2.1
Page 2 of 2
(vii)  reinforcement of the Nicosia District Office 132/11 kV substation
and Larnaca 66/11 substation is required to meet increasing demand
from existing and new consumers in these towns; and
(viii)  reinforcement of the Orounda 66/11 kV substation which supplies the
surrounding rural area to meet increasing demand from existing and
new consumers, mostly for irrigation and industry.
III. Distribution System
The distribution system extension and reinforcement, is designed
to meet increased demand resulting from normal system growth and to supply
expected demand from major industrial and commercial consumers. The system
development is needed to meet requirements of low cost refugee housing devel-
opment, expansion of the Limassol and Larnaca harbors, further development
of the Larnaca International Airport, new and existing industrial cities in
Nicosia, Limassol, Larnaca and Paphos, and tourism investments along the
entire southern coast between Polis and Cape Greco. The planned distribution
system extensions and reinforcement will benefit about 51,000 new consumers
who will be connected to the system during the period 1980-1984 including
about 20,400 rural consumers.

ANNEX 4.7
Page 1 of 2
CYPRUS
POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
A. Income Statement
1.        Sales of electricity are based on EAC's estimated load growth.
The forecasts assume annual energy sales growth of 8.6% in 1980, 8.3% in
1981, 7.9% in 1982, 7.9% in 1983 and 7.4% in 1984. Average tariff increases
of 7% effective July 1, 1980, 2% from January 1, 1981, 3% from January 1,
1982, 9% from January 1, 1983 and 6% from January 1, 1984.
2.        Sales to consumers in the north are assumed to increase by 9.5%,
6.9%, 6.0%, 6.1% and 6.2% for the years 1980-84.
3.        Fuel cost increases are assumed to be recovered through the fuel
price adjustment surcharge.
4.        Operating and maintenance costs, 90% of which consists of salaries
and wages, are assumed to increase by 12% each year.
5.        Depreciation is computed at an average annual rate of 3% per annum
of the gross fixed assets in service at the beginning of the year.
6.        Interest charges are based on EAC's actual calculations.  New
borrowings are assumed to be at the following interest rates: IBRD loan
at 8.25%; suppliers' credits for which contracts have been signed at an
average of 6%; Euro-currency loan at current market rates (20% rate of
interest) with maturities of 8 years including 4 years of grace. Interest
during construction has been added to capital expenditures. It is assumed
that the rate of interest on the Euro-dollar loan will drop by one percent
in each of the following years so that the interest rate will be 20% in
1980, 19% in 1981, 18% in 1982, 17% in 1983 and 16% in 1984. During 1980,
the requirement would be met from the "bridging loan" to be given
by the Government at an interest rate of 8.5% and to be repaid to the
Government in 1981.
B. Balance Sheet
7.        Gross fixed assets in service are revalued at the end of 1979
using the coefficients mentioned in Annex 4.8. Thereafter they have been
revalued at the end of each subsequent year assuming an average inflation
rate of 7% each year.
8.        Inventories are assumed to increase during 1980-84 in keeping

with operation requirements.
9.        Accounts receivables: the forecasts assume receivables to
represent 43 days of sales.
10.       Customer's contributions are assumed to increase by CE 50,000
each year.
C. Sources and Applications of Funds
11.       Suppliers' credits of CE 14.4 million are shown of which CE 13.1
million has been secured from Austria, West Germany, Great Britain and
other countries and further suppliers' credit of CE 1.3 million at an
interest rate of 6% p.a. repayable in 24 semi-annual installments with
3 years of grace is being finalized.
12.       Construction requirements based on EAC estimates amount to:
1980     1981      1982     1983      1984

Main Principles for Revaluation of EAC's Assets
1. Revaluation adjustments should be limited to fixed assets, accumulated
depreciation, depreciation expense accounts (including assets financed
by customer contributions for extension).
2. Depreciation adjusted (revalued) for price-level changes should be used
for rate-making purposes.
3. Revaluation should be conducted using a series of annual co-efficients
based on the general wholesale price index published by the Department
of Statistics of the Government of Cyprus.
4. Revaluation should be carried out as of the end of each fiscal year.
However, at the time such revaluation is carried out, it may not always
be possible to compute the co-efficient as of December 31 of the year
owing to non-availability of the general wholesale price index. There-
fore, the annual co-efficient used for revaluation should be based on
the general wholesale price index as of October 31 of each year.
5. In revaluing fixed assets, not only completed works but also work in
progress should be revalued applying the annual revaluation co-efficient,
6. Any retirements or transfers of property in the future should carry with
them the appropriate portion of the revaluation adjustments.
