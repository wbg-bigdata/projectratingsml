 Tranching              The proposed loan is a single tranche, Development Policy Loan to be disbursed
                        upon World Bank Board approval, once a specific set o f conditions is met. The
                        loan which supports the first phase o f the authorities' 2005-08 "Financial Sector

I                       Reform Program" could have follow-up operations in support o f the subsequent
                        phases o fthat program.
 Description            The main development objective o f the government financial sector reform
                        program, and o f the proposed loan, is to build a more competitive financial
                        sector, with a sound banking system and insurance industry, able inthe medium-
                        term, to provide modern and efficient financial services. The operation would
                        assist Egypt move forward in strengthening the enabling environment for
                        financial intermediation, resource mobilization and risk management, and
                        increasing private sector role inthe provision o f financial services. The operation
                        would support policy reforms in the following three areas: (i)        strengthen the
                        domestic banking system inter-aliaby divesting fully public sector bank shares in
                        joint venture banks, privatizing one of the large state-owned commercial banks,
                        defining a framework to implement institutional, operational and financial
                        restructuring o f the remaining public banks, and consolidatingand merging small
                        banks in an over banked market; (ii)   develop the contractual savings system and
                        restructure the insurance industry so it can play an effective role in the
                        management and transfer o f risk and mobilization o f long-term savings; and (iii)
                        strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework for banks and non-bank
                        financial institutions to ensure compliance with international standards and
                        effective enforcement.
 Benefits               Benefits would result from removing major impediments to a more efficient
                        functioning o f the financial system within a stronger regulatory environment and
                        enhanced role for the private sector in financial services. Resolution o f the large
                        stock o f non-performing loans - a salient weakness o f the banking sector -would
                        strengthenover the medium-termthe systemcapacityfor financial intermediation,
                        efficiency in mobilization o f savings, and capacity to support corporate activities
                        and enhance growth.

 Risks                  The main risks could be a slowdown o f the reform momentum to a path that
                        would not allow for a genuine change towards market-based, risk-taking business
                        patterns in the public financial institutions (moral hazard issue). This relates
                        particularly to the government's commitment to and decisiveness inrestructuring
                        the remaining two large public sector banks   - and until such time as their capital
                        can be open to private sector entry, instilling the governance, culture and
                        incentives that would weed out past business practices -the government capacity
                        to manage the related fiscal implications, and the ability to build an independent
                        and credible regulatory apparatus.

                FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                         TO THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT




                                  I. INTRODUCTION


1.      The financial sector inEgypt has been, over the past decade and a half, the subject o f
reform efforts aimed at financial liberalization to develop more effective financial
instruments, strengthen the system infrastructure, and enhance competitiveness through
increased private participation. Egypt, as a result, has modernized its financial system in a
measurableway, and provided increasedautonomy andpower to the monetary andregulatory
authorities. Inparticular, the government 1991Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment
Program, supported by a World Bank adjustment operation, was designed to achieve
macroeconomic stability and of which an integral part was financial sector reform. That
reform program sought, with a degree of success, to develop more effective monetary and
financial instruments to manage liquidity, liberalize interest rates and credit, and establish the
legal framework for privatization o ffinancial institutions.

2.      The financial sector, despite these positive steps, continues to face important
challenges given low levels o f competition, relatively high intermediation costs, limited
innovation, and dominance o f state ownership. The banking system is burdened by high
levels of non-performing loans, while the non-bank segment is characterized by
underdeveloped bond, insurance, and mortgage markets, thin trading in equities, weak
corporate governance, and weak infrastructure for effective payment systems. The 2002 joint
IMF-World Bank "Financial Sector Assessment Program" (FSAP) identified the main
weaknesses in banking and non-banking and highlighted key priorities for reform, many
endorsedbythe authorities (para. 20).

3.      The reformist govement that took office in June 2004 set a major agenda for
macroeconomic and structural reform and modernization. As part o f this agenda, outlined in
the GovernmentLetter of DevelopmentPolicy, it developed a program of financial reforms that
was formally endorsedby the President of Egypt in September2004. Officially referred to as
the "Financial Sector Reform Program", it i s to be implemented over 2005-08. The program
represents the most far reaching, substantive and comprehensivedrive towards financial sector
strengtheningto have been launched so far inEgypt- and indeedin any other country of the
Middle-EastandNorthAfrica region.

4.      The program aims mainly at: (i)    consolidating the banking system by reducing by
nearly 21'3`~ the number of institutions in an over-banked (yet under-branched) domestic

                                                   - 2 -


market - including the landmark decision to merge the two public banks, Banque Misr and
Banque du Caire, the country's second and third largest; (ii)           divestingfully state-ownedbank
shares injoint-venture banks (de facto largely controlled by the state-ownedbanks), creating
thus the core o f a domestic private banking system that would account for 20 percent of
system deposits; (iii)     privatizing the state-owned fourth largest commercial bank (Bank of
Alexandria with 7 percent o f sector deposits); (iv) restructuring the remaining two public
sector banks(National Bank o fEgypt, andthe mergedBanqueMisr-BanqueduCaire) through
an in-depth capacity building program to allow them to operate on a commercially viable
basis in increasingly open and competitive markets (the authorities have not specified a
timeframe for the eventual opening up o f the capital of these two state-owned banks, which
would still account for about 40 percent of the system); (v) reforming the insurance sector
both at regulatory and company levels, inter-alia inprivatizing at least one of the three state-
owned (direct) insurance companies, and assessing the need for a major overhaul o f the
others, with a possible reallocation o f market sub-segment activities; and (vi) seeking to
develop a new system o f mortgage finance for a more sustainable housing finance market.
Underpinning the whole program is a major effort aimed at strengthening the regulatory
capacity andsupervisory apparatus.

rallying asset values, falling inflation rates, sliding unemployment, and more optimistic
expectations and investor sentiment. Reforms implemented by the government included: (i)
restructuring and slashing custom duties; (ii)         improving management o f exchange rate and
monetary policies; (iii)    accelerating the privatization program with sale proceeds o f USs3.2
billion equivalent (4 percent of GDP) since June 2004 which is beyond the level initially
foreseen; (iv) advancing fiscal reforms with drastically reduced personal and corporate tax
rates and simplified tax structure; (v) substantially limiting regulatory impediments to
business entry and licensing; (vi) partially adjusting prices for some fuel products; and (vii)
concluding new trade agreements. Preparatory work has also started on the more complicated
reform agendao fthe social safetynet, pension system andhealth insurance.

6.       Inthe financial sector, the authorities have forged ahead and already implemented
reforms at the institutional, legal, regulatory andcorporate levels; thus:

7.      To carry their ambitious program through, the authorities have sought financial and
technical assistance from the USA, the European Union, the Afiican Development Bank, the
International MonetaryFund, andthe World Bank, asking the latter, inaddition, to coordinate
potential support efforts.      This report assesses the government program, its specific
components, and the elements which the World Bank views as critical to ensuringsuccessful
program implementation.       It recommends that World Bank assistance in the form of a
development policy loan be made available to the government o f Egypt to implement, and
help fund the costs o fthe first phaseo fthe reforms.


                        11.     MACROECONOMICFRAMEWORK


8.      The banking systemrests on a fairly sound economy. Real GDP grew by 5 percent in
fiscal 2004105 (Le. July 2004 to June 2005) and, with the reforms underway, this i s projected
to be 6 percent through 2006107 despite some concerns, particularly over the large budget
deficit. Recent developments are outlined before the current concerns.

(a) Recentdevelopments
    -
9.      Real GDP grew by 4.2 percent in2003104 and 5.1 percent in2004105 after the anemic

                                                        - 5 -


3 percent during 2001-03, The external sector has thrived with exports receipts (including
from tourism and Suez Canal eamings) rising by 25.5 percent in2004105 versus 31.9 percent
in 2003/042.        The stock market is booming and there are signs of increased investor
confidence with rating agencies (Fitch, and Standard & Poor) raising Egypt's economic
outlook from negative to stable last year.

10.      The large current account surplus and low international indebtednesshelp insulate the
economy from external shocks. The current account surplus was a substantial US$2.9 billion
in 2004105 (3.3 percent of GDP), only slightly smaller than 2003104's US$3.4billion (4.3
percent of GDP). Net international reserves have risen to an ample US$22.5 billion (March
2006), or over sevenmonths of imports and almost eight times Egypt's debt service. External
debt was a modest US$29 billion3(31.2 percent of GDP) in June 2005 of which less than 7
percent was of short maturities and the bulk is of 20 year maturity with a 4 percent average
interest rate.

11.      Economic managementhas improvedinrecent years. The authorities are ensuringthat
the managemento f the exchangerate, monetary and fiscal policies i s consistently coordinated,
and appropriate tools are beingdeveloped; towards this end, the CBE hadto ensure a smooth
functioning of the exchange rate market and develop a more comprehensivemonetary policy
framework. The authorities announced that they would target inflation over the mediumterm
andthe exchangerate regime is now amanagedfloat although the pound's nominal exchange
rate with the dollar is keptwithin anarrow bandafter a recent nominal appreciation (to around
5.75 perUS

12.      Egyptian CPI declined from its October 2004 peak of 18.2 percent to 3.7 percent in
March 2006. Broad monetary aggregates have risenby over 13 percent last year, mostly due
to the increase innet foreign assets.

13.      The overall government budget deficit5 and net government debt are high(9.6 and 76
percent of GDP respectively, Table-I) although government revenues are substantial at around


  The Government set up "Qualified Industrial Zones" in December 2004 where products manufactured with
11.7 percent o f Israeli-origin components have tariff-free entry into the UnitedStates.
 Underthe 1991Paris Club agreement, external payments were rescheduledbutthe localcurrency equivalents of
public enterprises' external borrowings were deposited per the original schedule in a `<blockedaccount" at the
Central Bank o f Egypt. This amounts to LE70 billion (over US$12 billion).
  The pound was pegged to the dollar until 2000, a series o f step devaluations followed until 2002, and a
managed float was frrst attempted in 2003 but succeeded in 2004. The divergence between the official and
parallel market exchange rates disappeared by late 2004, thereby eliminating rents and arbitrage. The surrender
requirement on export proceeds was eliminated in September 2004 and an inter-bank foreign exchange market
was established inDecember 2004.
* The definition o f ``government" (central and local levels plus public service authorities) remains unchanged
since 2000. The Egyptian budget classification and hence deficit data are being improved since 2005 and The
Ministry o f Finance has reclassified fiscal data back only to 2001102 making the earlier series non-comparable.
Official data for "General government" (that also includes the NIB and the SIFs) are not yet available, and the
IMFestimatesthese, This report usesofficial data to make it easier for the authorities.

a quarter o f GDP. The income tax law o f July 2005 simplified the rate structure, halving
personal and corporate tax rateswhile raising the minimumthreshold to broadenthe tax base.
Tax administration i s improving with increased inspection and the creation o f a dedicated
large taxpayer unit.6 The general sales tax is being modified to become a full-fledged VAT
system. The level and dispersion of customs duties were reducedinAugust 2004 (the number
of tariff bands fell from 27 to 6), and customs procedures simplified, reducingthe weighted
averagetarifffrom 14.6 percentto 9.1 percent.

14.      High government expenditures, their allocation, control and the poorly targeted
subsidies are of concern andthe authorities are improvingbudget management. The Ministry
o f Planning (responsible for the investment budget) andthe Ministry ofFinance are beginning
to control the numerous offbudgetaccounts, estimated at over 4 percento f GDP.

15.      Subsidies that state-owned enterprises provide through under-priced goods and
services are gradually being included explicitly in the budget, and such improved
classification and transparency will allow better allocation and control. Even so, some 50
economic authorities (some quasi commercial, affiliated with line ministries) still operate
outside the budget.

16.      The government budget is consolidated for 14 line ministries, 26 governorates, and 82
public service agencies, but there are about 5,000 accounts that are not centrally controlled.
After the cabinet agrees to the proposed single Treasury account (under the Ministry o f
Finance purview), Parliamentwould have to amend the state accounting law. So despite the
progress, muchremains to bedone.

(b) Currentconcerns
    -

17.      The overall government budget deficit remains worryingly high. The authorities
recognize that budget deficits      of nearly 10 percent o f GDP are unsustainable and have
indicated that they plan to reduce the budget deficit gradually by over 1percent o f GDP in
each o f the next five years, bringing it down to 4 percent o f GDP by 2010111. Whether this
could be done remains to be seen: the authorities must skillfully balance prudent economic
management andpublic sentiment that has longbeen accustomedto the subsidies. The World
Bank is working with the government to identi3 several poorly targeted subsidies and
improvethe effectivenesso fpublic social spending (e.g. the studyo fthe social safety net).

18.      The budget deficit is financed through increased domestic borrowing, largely through
the Social Insurance Fund( S F holds 40 percent o fthe domestic debt) andthe bankingsystem
that holds more than 95 percent of the Treasury bill stock (70 percent o fwhich are heldbythe
state-owned banks) and funds about 4.3 percent o f GDP during each o f the last five years.
Banks' excessive financing o f budget deficits results in their losing lending skills (e.g.
assessingcredit risks and makingandcollecting on loans).


 Preliminary data for 2005106 show individual income tax revenues increasing by 17percent and a 30 percent
increase inthe number oftax payers.

                                                   - 7 -


19.     The reforms underway in the banking system also entail some risks, though slight.
With the highstock of domestic debt, eventhe belated accountingrecognition ofpoor loansin
the banking system (a sunk cost) could affect market perceptions, put upward pressure on
interest rates and hence expenditures, and widenthe overall budget deficit further.

MAINFINANCIALSECTORISSUES

20.      Significant reforms have been implemented inEgypt to strengthen and modernize the
financial sector, yet important challenges still lie ahead. The main challenges were identified
in the Egypt 2002 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) which highlighted key
priorities for reform in banking and non-banking, many endorsed by the authorities.
Recommended banking sector reforms were to: (i)                  strengthen the regulatory fkamework,
including procedures for troubled-bank resolution, bankruptcy and foreclosure of collaterals;
(ii) recognize, through audits to assess loan recoverability, the fiscal risks embedded in the
public bank loan portfolios; (iii)        complete the privatization of joint venture banks, and
proceed towards the privatization o f the state-owned banks soon as conditions permit; and
(iv) bepreparedto provide additional capital to public banksifnecessarybefore privatization,
but only inconjunction with new managementandacceptablerestructuring andasset recovery
plans. For the non-bank segment, recommendations were to: (i)                   develop the stock market
 further, inter-alia in addressingweaknesses in auditing practice and corporate governance to
buildinvestor confidence, and strengthen investor protection rules in terms of enforcement

  Net government debt is defmed as the sum of the government's external and domestic debt: the latter includes
net claims on central and local governments, municipalities and public service authorities. (Ministry of Finance,
Financial Monthly, February 2006).

and sanctions; (ii)restructure the insurance industry to enhance its role in resource
mobilization and risk transfer; and (iii)            review the structure and financing of the social
security system and reform the pension system to ensure public andprivate pension programs
long-term sustainability and containment o fgovernment contingent liabilities.

21.      Banking plays a central role in the financial system, accounting for more than
60 percent o f the system assets. Total bank deposits amount to about 100 percent of GDP.
Credit to the private sector, which accounts for 54 percent of GDP (a non-negligible ratio in
terms o f country comparators, yet half the OECD average o f 110 percent) has been the main
source o f growth in bank assets over the past decade, despite a decline registeredduring the
last three years. Banking is dominated by state ownership which accounts for more than 58
percent o f total deposits. Public banks have a relatively extensive branch network, and hold
equity capital, and de facto governance sway, in most joint venture banks. The state fully
owns the four largest commercial banks (National Bank o f Egypt, Banque Misr, Banque du
Caire, and Bank of Alexandria) - the second and third to be merged - and three specialized
banks (EgyptianArab LandBank, Industrial Development Bank o fEgypt, andPrincipalBank
for Development and Agricultural Credit). Although private and joint venture banks are
growing faster than their public sector counterparts, they remainrelatively small, with modest
branching. The table below provides the percentage distribution o f bankingsector deposits
amongstpublic sector, joint-venture, andprivate foreign banks, as o fDecember2004.

22.      Compared to their private counterparts, public banks lag in efficiency and generally in
performance. They are undercapitalized and overstaffed, have poor asset quality, low profit
margins, highoperating costs, and inadequaterisk management systems, and have been slow
to modernize andinnovate. The poor quality o ftheir portfolio is now officially acknowledged.
These weaknesses havehada deleterious effect on the financial markets, and on the efficiency
of resource allocation. Although official figures for non-perfoming to total loans have been
steadily rising - from 12 percent in 1999 to 16 percent in 2003, and 20 percent in 20048 --


 It is also worth noting that a sizable part o f nonperforming loans have been restructured, some of which under
very concessional terms. These mayrepresent hidden weaknesses inthe banks' portfolio.

                                              - 9 -


they were still underestimated. Indeed, had strict loan classification criteria been applied, and
roll-over o f loans taken into account, actual levels of non-performingloans would have been
higher. Strengthening and streamlining banking regulation and supervision to ensure, inter-
alia, rigorous loan assessment and classification i s a key part o f the government reform
program.

23.     Egypt's insurance and contractual savings sector is small given the size of the
economy, and has considerable potential for further development and efficiency gains.
Combined insurance and private pension funds under management amounted to LE 32.8
billion in June 2004, equal to only 8 percent o f GDP. Competition in insurance tends to be
based on price rather than product innovation, Annual insurance premia represent only 1.1
percent o f GDP, andper capita spendingon insurance is estimated at US$9 equivalent. This
situation can be attributed mainly to the lack o f insurance awareness, a price driven agency
system and limited product innovation. Another impediment is the tax system, as reflected in
the relatively heavy turnover tax levied on insurance premia, The sector is largely dominated
by public ownership. The four largest insurers (including one reinsurance company) are
majority state-ownedand account for about 90 percent o f the industryinterms o fpolicyholder
claims. The structure o f the non life insurance market has witnessed minimal changes over
the past decade. However, increasingcompetition fiom new entrantshas eroded the public life
insurance sector market share. Inthe context o f ongoing sector liberalization and open entry
for foreign companies, a major restructuring program - addressing skills misalignment,
underwritingstandards, risk management, and asset investment policies -is required to allow
the public sector companies to withstand incoming competition, ensure ongoing technology
transfer and prepare some o f them for privatization. Although current regulations allow
insurance companiesample flexibility inthe investment o fthe reservestheyhold insupport o f
policyholder obligations, most o f these reserves continue to be invested ingovernment bonds
or bank term deposits at a time when the capital market is beginning to produce acceptable
securities including securitized debt.

24.     The pension system is an essential component of the contractual savings scheme.
Reform actions related to the privatepension funds are neededgiven the institutional situation
andsize ofthese funds, andtheir significant potential role as a source oflongterm investment
funds. Private funds are not being optimally run for members' benefit, with preliminary
evidence pointingto a lack o f trained personnel and actuaries - implyingcursory reviews for
smaller funds, though the larger supervised schemes may have reasonable actuarial overview
with EISA maintaining an overview role. There is a need to carry out a one time actuarial
review of all schemes (including some large syndicate funds) to determine fundinglevels, and
ifnecessarydeveloparesolutionstrategy.

25.     The capital markets have potential for further development. Although the equities o f
over 750 companies are listed on one official and two "unofficial" boards, and market
capitalization i s sizable (56 percent o f GDP) with rising trends in stock indices, trading
volumes remain anemic and turnover shallow. The maininstruments traded on the exchange
comprise common and preferred stocks, government and corporate bonds, and closed-end
funds. Fixed income securities of the government, the National Investment Bank and some

                                                      - 10-


corporations are also traded. Government bonds, with maturities ranging from 7 to 20 years,
provide, despite lack o f secondary market liquidity, a yield curve off which corporate debt
maybe priced andhelp inthe development of a corporate bondmarket.

26.      The housing finance market continues to face challenges, and despiteprogresstowards
the development o f a new mortgage finance system, mortgage markets remain limited in
scope and activity. Issues relate to high fees and inefficient procedures for land registration,
weak regulatory authority and poor access to long-term credit (with a limit o f 5 percent
imposed on bank credit to real estate). The financial leasing industryis also underdeveloped
with only seven companies operating with low annual volumes o f leases, again the result of
inadequate property registration system, stamp duties, and lax judicial system. Other non-
bank financial institutions such as venture capital and factoring are hardly existent with some
related financial servicesbeingprovided bybanks.

27.      There also remain pervasive weaknesses in the legal, regulatory, and supervisory
framework o f banking and insurance, as well as shortcomings in regulatory enforcement
capacity. Moreover, Egypt needs to improve the quality of the financial sector infrastructure
interms of efficiency ofthe payment systems, reliability andtimeliness of credit information
systems, and transparency o f corporate accounting and auditing standards - a critical element
for reliable credit assessment bylendinginstitutions.

GOVERNMENTPROGRAM

28.       The authorities are committed to improving the performance and soundness of the
financial sector, and fostering an enabling environment for the emergence o f an efficient,
increasingly private sector-led, financial system that could serve better the country
development and growth objectives. (The drive for reform also addresses fiscal impediments,
with the taxation of financial intermediation being reviewed in the draft tax law currently
discussed in parliament, notably to devise a revenue-neutral tax reform package for the
financial sector, potentially: reducing stamp duties on credit andinsurance; remunerating bank
requiredreserves; allowing a less restrictive approach to deductibility o f loan-loss reserves;
andreconsidering concessions for listing on the stock exchange, for pensions andwithrespect
to return on treasury bills and deposit interest, ensuring a level playing field for various
financial instruments.) The government 2005-08 "Financial Sector Reform Program" builds
on the following pillars.

(a) Reformingthe bankingsystem
     -

29.       The government reform program aims at: (i)                consolidating the banking system' in

' Transactions completedto date include: (i) September 2004 merger of Misr Exterior with Banque Misr; (ii) April
                                           The                                                            The
2005 merger of CrCdit Agricole with Crkdit Lyonnais under the new name of Calyon-Egypt; (iii)
                                                                                            The June 2005 merger of
American Express with Egyptian American Bank; (iv) The July 2005 merger of Arab African International Bank and Misr
AmericaBank; (v) The October 2005 merger of MohandesBankwith National Bankof Egypt; and (vi) The December 2005
merger of Bank of Commerce & Development with National Bank of Egypt. A major development in this regard however
relatesto announcedmerger ofBanquedu Caire with BanqueMisr.

reducing the number o f banks from 57 in 2004 to 34 by end-2007 (to be achieved through
mergers and acquisitions of small andpoorly performingbanks or those that didnot meet the
new minimumcapital requirementof LE500million byJuly 2005, or through market driven
transactions); (ii)divesting fklly state-owned bank shares in joint venture banks", and
allocating sale proceeds to the restructuring costs of public sector banks; and (iii)                   privatizing
one o f the state-owned commercial banks and restructuring the others so they be able to
operate on a commercially sound basis in an increasingly open and competitive market
environment.

30.      The legal framework was considerably enhanced with the enactment of the "Central
Bank, Banking and Credit Law" (law 88 of 2003), which sought to: (i)strengthen the
independence of the central bank; (ii)enforce bank corporate governance rules; (iii)
strengthen prudential regulations, develop a mechanism to monitor compliance; (iv) raise
substantially bank minimum capital"; (v) eliminate barriers to bank operational flexibility
(such as the distinction between specialized, business, and commercial banks); (vi)
discontinue the special treatment o fpublic banks to enhance competition; (vii) assert the right
of private sector parties to own shares inpublic banks12;and (viii) establishprinciples for loan
settlements and workouts. The Central Bank o f Egypt (CBE) and banks also worked on
developing an automated credit risk information system, while a law was enacted to bestow
legal power on electronic signatures thereby facilitating e-commerce and e-banking services.
Prior to launching the joint venture bank divestment program and the privatization drive for
the Bank of Alexandria, there were no major changes in the ownership structure o f
commercial banks, although new management was introduced in 2003 at the seven public
sector banks.

31.      The authorities announced in early 2005 that Bank of Alexandria, Egypt's fourth
largest bank with 7 percent o f banking system's deposits, was candidate for privatization.
They engaged a major firm to conduct an independent audit of the bank and, following an
international request for proposal, hired a world-leading investment bank to act as sale side
advisor. The announcement o f the sale and call for expressions o f interest was issued end-
March2006. Inparallel, international firms have beenhiredfor the audits of the other public
sector commercial banks, with completion due inJune 2006.


lo State-ownedbank shares injoint venture bankswere sold to private interests in 12banks, namely: the EgyptianAmerican
Bank (33.8% public ownership), National SociCtC GCnhale Bank (1 8.7%),       Cairo Barclays Bank (40%), Misr America
InternationalBank (48.9%), Misr RomaniaBank (33.3%), Egyptian CommercialBank (9.8%), Suez CanalBank (5%), and
MisrInternationalBank(25.9%), CommercialInternationalBank(CIB) (18.9%), MisrIranDevelopmentBank(30%), Delta
InternationalBank (10.2%), and Cairo Far East Bank (19.6%). The sale processof state-ownedbank shares is underwayin
5 joint-venture banks, namely: the Egyptian Saudi Finance Bank (5.3%), Egyptian Workers Bank (9.8%), Alexandria
Commercial& Maritime Bank (5%), Cairo BNP ParibasLe Caire(4.8%), andExportDevelopmentBank of Egypt (34.5%).
``Before   the new banking law, the minimumcapital requirements was LE 100 million for domestic banks and
US$15 million for branches o f foreign banks, and currently after the issuance o f the new law in 2003 it was
raisedto LE500 million, and US$50 million, respectively effective July 15,2005.
l2The regulatory framework for bank privatization has been set inLaw 25 o f 1998, and the new banking law has
asserted private sectors' right to own shares in state-owned banks. It is worth noting that before 1998, public
banks were subject to the same law as all public companies, namely Law 97 o f 1983, which did not allow the
transfer o f shares from public companies, except to another. Even when Law 203 o f 1991 was passed, allowing
public companies to sell their shares, state-owned banks were not coveredby this law.

                                             - 12-


32.     One o f the challenges of restructuring the large commercial public banks, and of the
privatization o f Bank o f Alexandria, relates to the nonperforming loans (NPLs) of public
sector enterprises - "Law 203 Companies" which are under the purview o f the ministry o f
investment. To address the problem, the authorities have opted for a scheme involving a time-
bound cash settlement o f these NPLs to be largely funded from state-owned enterprise
privatizationproceeds.(Bank ofAlexandria's arrears havenow been settled. (paras. 69-71).

33.     The authorities rightly view the build-up o f a strong and credible regulatory and
supervisory framework as an essential element o f the financial reform program. The CBE -
after having formally acted on separating the monetary policy and banking supervision
functions - has embarked on a comprehensive program o f capacity building covering
extended areas o f the regulatory and supervisory functions. To this end the CBE has secured
support under EUknding from the European Central Bank - through the member countries'
national regulatory bodies - for a broad two-year program o f technical assistance (paras. 53-
55) launched in December 2005, and conducted by a resident advisor to CBE's Banking
Supervision Department and aproject coordinator. An Anti Money Laundering Law hasbeen
adopted, with independent enforcement mechanisms, and Egypt having fulfilled all legal and
institutional requirements in accordance with the FATF recommendations and measures, was
removedinearly 2004, from the list o fnon-cooperating countries andterritories.

(b) Reformingthe contractualsavings system
    -

34.     The non-bank financial sector witnessed a number o f reforms, with the ministry of
investment now overseeing all non-bank financial institutions, and new management
introduced at all supervisory and regulatory bodies. Inthe insurance sector, the government
program o freform sets an ambitious agendaboth at regulatory andcompany levels.

35.     With regard to regulatory issues, the assessment of codes and standards under the
FSAP had concluded that: (i)    insurance supervision in Egypt was "largely compliant'' with
IAIS standards, although there was a need to strengthen coordination and consultation with
other national supervisors as well as with foreign insurance supervisors; and (ii)future
challenges facing the insurance supervisory authority lie mainly inmoving fi-oma compliance
to risk-based supervision systemunder the new IAIS Methodology which is more demanding
inareas such as risk management. There is a need for a substantial upgrading of skills anda
possible restructuring o fEISA. Inparticular, while EISAhas a large staff with relativelygood
academic credentials and an excellent IT department, there i s a lack o fnon life actuarial skills.
The fbndamental role of a supervisor in a market based environment is yet to be fully
assimilated and the current structure may be inhibiting innovation, access to data and open
communication.      The upgrading o f EISA i s a priority for the Minister o f Investment.
Moreover, Egypt is committed to achieving full compliance with GATS commitments
regardinginsurance sector Liberalization.

36.     At the company level - with new management at the helm of all firms - the reform
program aims inter-alia at: (i)privatizing at least one o f the three state-owned (direct)
insurance companies; and (ii)  assessing the need for a major overhaul o f the others, with a

                                            - 13 -


possible reallocation o f market sub-segment activities, and setting benchmarks enabling
adequatemonitoringo f the sector. The public reinsurancecompany -which hasnow foregone
some o f the privileges derived from what used to be a partially captive domestic market for
reinsurance - is tryingto develop a more commercial approachunder its new management. In
addition, legal reforms (including legislative amendments to Insurance Law 10 of 1981)
allowing domestic companies to operate in insurance brokerage, governing mandatory car
insurance, and revamping stamp duties on insurancecontracts are considered. The Ministryof
Investment is also keen on reassessing and strengthening the situation o f the private pension
funds.

(c)- Strengthening   capital markets and mortgage finance

37.    In order to deepen the capital markets, the government reform program aims at
improving corporate governance through better information disclosure, more vigorous
enforcement actions and compliance with international codes and standards. Many o f the
measures contemplated have already been implemented[as outlined inpara. 6 (xv)] inter-alia
regarding: standards and rules on disclosure and transparency for exchange listing; corporate
governance procedures and rules (Institute o f Directors); protection o f investors against non-
commercial risk (Insurance Protection Fund); and primary dealership system in treasury
bonds.

38,    The government is also keen on creating a more active, competitive and sustainable
mortgage market with Egypt making strides in recent years towards the development and
emergence of a new system of mortgage finance. To this end, mortgage market reforms
undertaken recently aimed at strengthening the market legal and institutional fiamework, in:
(i)reorganizing the Mortgage Finance Authority (MFA) under a new management;
(ii)establishing a transparent system to protect property rights in streamlining real estate
registration and reducing property registration fees and facilitating foreclosure procedures;
(iii)improving housing affordability, and reducing lending and finding risks for lenders and
investors in mortgage securities, in coordinating with the insurance sector to provide better
comprehensive market coverage to borrowers through studying the introduction o f mortgage
relatedinsuranceproducts like credit failure insuranceandtitle insurance; and(iv) securitizing
the portfolio o fperforminghousing loans to create liquiditythat would help finance additional
housing units.


                IV.    BANKSUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT STRATEGY


OBJECTIVEAND RATIONALE

39.    (a) - Objective. The main development objective o f the government financial sector
reform program, and o f the proposed World Bank operation, i s to build a more resilient and
competitive financial sector with a sound banking system and insurance industry that could
contribute better, in the medium-term, to the provision o f modem and effective financial

                                             - 14-


services. The World Bank supports the government reform proposals, which in many areas
are consistent with the World Bank assistancestrategy for Egypt to support economic growth.
The proposed operation would help achieve this objective inparticular by lockingina set o f
irreversible policy measures (para. 6) undertaken under the first phase o f the government
reform program. World Bank follow-up operations insupport o fthe government strategy and
reform momentum over the 2008 medium-term framework would be decided in light of
government actions and achievements through the program subsequent phases, outlined inthe
attached operational policy matrix (Annex VI>. To this effect, World Bank assistance under
the proposed and potential follow-up operations would seek to: (i)    strengthen the regulatory
and supervisory framework for banks and non-bank financial institutions to ensure
compliance with international standards and effective enforcement; (ii)     reform the banking
system through consolidation, privatization o f state-owned and joint-venture banks, and
restructuring o f the remaining public sector banks; and (iii)restructure the insurance industry
to develop and deepen the financial sector (World Bank assistance in the areas o f public
pension andmortgage markets is beingprovidedseparately).

40.     (b)-Rationale. WorldBankinvolvement insupport ofEgypt's financial sectorreform
program would build upon the policy dialogue the World Bank has conducted with the
authorities over the recent years, particularly in the context of, and as a follow up to, the
FSAP.The experiencethat the World Bankhas gatheredindevelopment policy lendinginthe
financial sector is highly valued by the authorities, as it was brought to bear on the design of
the program, and would help in its on-going implementation, The authorities take further
comfort from the long-term involvement of the World Bankin, andthe comprehensivenesso f
its approach to, financial sector reform and development inEgypt. The perception thus that
the World Bank i s prepared to remain engaged and support the authorities in moving with
their reforms beyondthe time-frame o f the proposedloan-ina way congruent with the 2005-
08 medium-term framework withinwhich the government program is cast -makes the World
Bank aprivilegedpartner. Moreover, the World Bankhasbeencoordinating, andis expected
to continue to coordinate efforts o f bilateral and multilateral donors in a concerted way that
would help marshal more effectively the potential financial assistance and smooth the
implementation o fwhat is a tall reform agenda.

LINKTO CAS

41.     Competitive financial markets are at the heart o f a private-led growth process. This
operation would therefore support the Government o f Egypt in addressing its first strategic
objective under the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussedby the Board inJune 2005:
that is to "strengthen the capacity o f the financial system to facilitate private sector
development". More specifically, this operation intends to contribute to the outcomes under
the Results Framework o f the CAS for a "More Competitive and Efficient Financial Sector".
These outcomes will be measuredby indicators such as the decline inpublic ownership inthe
bankingsector; the privatizationof a major public commercial bank andjoint-venture banks;
and the restructuring o f public sector insurance companies. By addressing the highlevel of
non-performing loans in public financial institutions - with its deleterious effect on the
banking system as a whole - together with the necessary and parallel strengthening o f the

                                                    - 1 5 -


regulatory environment, the operation would help alleviate one of the impediments to a more
efficient functioning o f the financial system, and its ability, in the medium-term, to improve
financial intermediation insupport ofreal sector growth.

42.      The proposal for a development policy loan requires that the highcase scenario under
the CAS be met, as predicated on the two triggers pertaining to: "(a) clear signs of
implementation of substantive financial sector reforms, including significant restructuring
(and recapitalization) of the public sector banks, and movement towards the privatization of
the Bank of Alexandria; and (b) the adoption of a financing plan under which at least 10
percent o f the financingneeds o f the financial sector restructuring program is to be met from
non-debt creating sources. Such sources could include, but not necessarily be limited to the,
grants from donors, andproceeds from the privatizationo f state-ownedenterprises, divestiture
of public shares in the joint public-private banks, and the sale o f the Bank o f Alexandria"
(CAS - Assistance Program Scenario - para.106). Inthis regard, the sale proceeds from the
public enterprise privatization program have already yielded close to LE19 billion (US$3.2
billion equivalent) since 2004, exceeding already the 10 percent threshold (when related to
bankingsector restructuring costs estimated at LE50billion). Fromthe foregoing thus, it can
be statedthat the conditions for the highcase scenariounder the CAS are present.

COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHERDONORS

43.      There has beengood collaboration between the World Bank and the IMF in Egypt in
the financial sector. Inthe context o f the FSAP and the IMFArticle IV process, the IMF has
advocated, together with the Bank, a strengthening o f the financial sector legal and regulatory
framework and a restructuring o f public financial institutions particularly in addressing the
burdenofdistressedassets.

44.      O f the other donors, USAID and the European Union (EU) have been actively
involved in the financial sector over the past few years, and have in particular supported
analytical work on reforming and restructuring the financial sector13. The European Central
Bank (ECB) andthe FederalReserveBank have beenprovidingtechnical support inthe area
o f banking supervision. Moreover, a large assistance and training program for banking
supervision i s being put in place by the ECB (paras. 53-58). It i s expected that cooperation
both upstream in analytical work and downstream in program implementation would
continue. The Afkican Development Bank (AfDB), which from the outset was assessing the
potential for assistance to the government program, has conducted its appraisal o f the
proposed operation jointly with the World Bank. The IFC had also expressed interest in
further involvement inthe financial sector, as opportunities may arise for private transactions
-andhasindeedbeenoneofthe investors inthe transaction inwhichpublic sector shares
were fully divested inCIB (Egypt largestjoint venture bank).


l3Support providedby USAID includes: (i) sector reform-MOU (US$1,2 billion) inthe form ofbudget
                                            financial
support; (ii)
            reformo fthe commercial law (US$25 million); (iii) sector reform(US$IOOmillion); (iv)
                                                                 banking
capital market reforms (US37 million); (v) mortgage finance (US$40 million); and (vi) insurance sector (US$50
million). EUsupport covers the payment system (Euro 2 million), banking supervision (Euro 2.8 million), public
bank restructuring (Euro8 million), and capital market (Euro 3.2 million).

                                               - 16-


45.      The World Bank, at the request ofthe Egyptianauthorities, is coordinating all donors'
initiatives related to financial sector reform to avoid overlap and address key issues on a
timely and priority basis. To this end, a "Financial Sector Donors Subgroup", chaired by the
World Bank has been formed to coordinate efforts related to both technical and financial
support provided to the government. One outcome of this group is the joint World Bank-EU
project for modemizingthe payments system at the CBE.

RELATIONSHIPTO OTHERBANKOPEFLATIONS

46.      As a follow-up to the FSAP, there have been three "FIRST Initiative" projects
sponsoredby the World Bank. The first - "Strengthening BankingSupervision" - has as an
objective to shore up the capacity of the banking supervision department at CBE as regards
connected lending, large exposures and market risk assessment, and to improve data
collection and analysis for credit information purposes on banks and large enterprises. The
second - "Automation o f CBE's Credit Information System" - has as an objective to
strengthen the existing credit information department at CBE, and at the same time to make
the necessary regulatory, legal and institutional changes to allow for the establishment o f
private credit bureaus that would cater bothto banks and non-bank financial institutions. The
third- "Modemizing the Payments System" -aims at strengthening the payments system at
the central bank; this project is done in collaboration with the EU, where the EUis providing
the equipment inrelation to the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, and the World
Bankisprovidingthe technical support.

47.      Inparallel to the proposed loan, the World Bank is supporting the housing sector
policy reforms (para. 38). A Mortgage MarketDevelopment Project i s under preparationwith
focus on: (i) establishing a mortgage finance liquidityfacility; (ii)
                                                                   strengthening the regulatory
framework for mortgage lending; and (iii)modernizing the system o f property rights
registration. Several o fthe measuresto be supported underthe mortgage market project would
reinforce the objectives o f the proposed financial sector operation. An IDF Grant for the
establishment o f the Institute o f Directors, through which the World Bank supports technical
assistance to improve the functioning of capital markets and in particular seeks to: (i)
strengthen corporate governance practices; (ii)      provide research and technical advisory
services to enhance compliance with laws and regulations; and (iii)      promote awareness o f
benefits o f good corporate governance. Furthermore, the World Bank is providing technical
 assistance to build capacity to follow up on initiatives related to anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism (AMLICFT).           Assistance i s currently underway in
developing a certificate program for AML/CFT compliance officers. Interms of analytical
work, the World Bank has initiated the study on access to financial services, one o f the
 activities proposed underthe 2005 CAS.

 LESSONSLEARNED

 48,     A number o f lessons are usefid to instruct the design and potentialimplementation o f
 the proposed operation - some to be found notablyinOED's 2005 extensive review o f World
 Bank assistance for financial sector reform, covering an eleven year period, hundreds o f loans

                                              - 1 7 -


and US$56 billion in lending to over 85 countries. One of the lessons stemming from'
financial sector adjustment operations and bank restructuring projects inother countries is the
risk inherent inthe financial and operational restructuring o f state-ownedfinancial institutions
without the authorities' firm commitment to subsequent privatization. Inrelation to, and to
mitigate such risk, relevant lessons bear on the importance of dealing effectively with the
problem o f non-performing loans, while promoting radical changes in credit allocation
policies by the restructured -but yet not privatized-banks, under a new set o f incentives and
reliable and effective managerial, institutional, operational and financial practices and
policies. This -rather thanignoringthe NPLburdenand institutional weaknesses, andmerely
providing grace periods during which institutions are exempt from prudential compliance -
would be essential to ensure the needed discipline to part with lax lending and operational
practices. Inthis regard, the needto develop monitorable performance indicators is also made
clear. Moreover, experience highlights the critical importance of building the institutional
capacity o f the financial sector regulators to implement the components of the reform
program. In this regard, both banking and insurance regulators in Egypt have developed
capacity buildingprograms, with sustained expert external assistance, which would be closely
monitoredduringprogram implementation.

49.     The challenges of financial reforms are also evident when looking at past World Bank
interventions in the sector in Egypt. Indeed, the assessment of the World Bank FY91
structural adjustment loan notes a mixed outcome. While trade and pricing policies were
liberalized, many o fthe structural reforms aiming to reducethe role o fthe state and strengthen
the private sector fell short o f expectations. Faring also poorly was the "Technical Assistance
Project for Privatization, Enterprise, and Banking Sector Reform" approved in FY92, and
cancelled in 1996 with less than US$0.5 million disbursed out o f US$9 million with meager
progress on the component to "design and implement a comprehensive banking sector
reform".   While this states the difficulties o f implementing substantive reforms within the
former Egyptian environment, it highlights also clearly the degree to which the World Bank
dialogue with the Egyptianauthorities has advanced since then. Against this background, one
key element of the World Bank discussions with the authorities has been to insist on clear
actions and agreement on an adequate approach to the dual objective of: (i)        enhancing the
efficiency o f financial institutions in increasing private sector role therein; and (ii)
                                                                                        restoring
the financial health and architecture o frestructured banks, includingthe need for capital build-
upto meet prudential requirements inline with measurableprogressinthe implementationof
the institutional and operational capacity build-up o f those banks. To avoid costly past
mistakes in this context, future relationships of public sector banks with state-owned
enterprises must be closely monitored (para. 71). The proposed engagement o f the World
Bank over an adequate period o f time during the implementation of the government program
aims at ensuringthat the medium-termcomponents o fthe reformpackage are implemented.

  V.      THE PROPOSEDFINANCIALSECTORDEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN


OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

51.      The proposed development policy loan would support the first phase of the
government's 2005-2008 agendato: (i) andput into effect the programto strengthen
                                            develop
the capacity o f the regulatory and supervisory authorities in banking and insurance so they
play their role effectively in ensuringmarket discipline and integrity; (ii) the banking
                                                                            reform
sector in consolidating and merging small banks, divesting fully public sector bank shares in
joint venture banks, privatizing one o f the large state-owned banks and initiating the
institutional, operational and financial restructuring o f the remaining state-owned banks
within an appropriate governance and incentive structure; and (iii)prepare for the
restructuring and potential privatization o f the state-ownedinsurance companies. The World
Bank, EU, USA, M F and AfDB would be all supporting the reformprogram, some through
specific components, with the World Bank coordinating the efforts o f the parties involved.
The dialogue betweenthe World Bank and the authorities, as a result o f which the scope o f
World Bank support under this operation has been defined, has covered the framework, pace,
and priorities inthe implementation of the reform program, and focused inter-alia on public
sector bank andinsurance companyrestructuring. The three proposedcomponents, consistent
withthe operationdevelopment objective, are reviewed inthe following sections.

         A Strengtheningthe financial system's regulatory and supervisory framework
           -
 52.     The strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework in the banking and
insurance industries is a criticalpart o f the financial reformprogram. A credible, independent
regulator is the necessaryanchor o fan effective andresilient financial system, especially inan
 environment where state ownership o f financial institutions i s expected to remain significant
inthemediumterm.

 (a) Banking sector regulation and supervision
    -
 53.     The CBE has embarked on a comprehensive two-year program o f capacity building
 covering extended areas of the regulatory and supervisory functions, as it i s seeking to move
 from compliance to risk-based supervision. To implement the program, the CBE secured
under EUfundingtechnical assistance fi-om the EuropeanCentralBank-through the member
 countries' national regulatory bodies, which together with the ECB are referred to as the
 "Eurosystem" - which has delegated inDecember 2005 an expert from the French Banking
 Commission for a period o f two years, to act as resident advisor to CBE BankingSupervision
 Department with assistance by 4 national banks (Deutsche Bundesbank, Banque de France,
 Banca D'Italia and Bank o f Greece) through ongoing missions. Under the Eurosystem-
 delivered program, an assessment o f banking supervision at the CBE was carried out. A

                                             - 19-


detailed plan for capacity building (Annex III> was approved at end-March 2006 by CBE
Deputy Governor inhis capacity as Chairman of the banking supervision steering committee.
The World Bank team, on the basis ofthe CBE-Eurosystemprogram, has rankedthe priorities
alonga two-phase actionplan.

        (i)FirstphaseofCBEcapacitybuildingprogram
           -

54.     This phase would set up the underpinnings of a strengthened regulatory and
supervisory framework. As a first priority under this first phase, CBE would conduct a
comprehensive review of the on-site and off-site processes, and carry out an organizational
restructuring o f the bankingsupervision fimction. This step i s critical to buildup an effective
bankingsupervision structure. The Eurosystemreport recommends creating new capacities in
such areas as macro prudentialmonitoring, legal and regulation oversight, and IT support and
methodology, while removing responsibilities in such others as FX control, customer
complaints activities and Court expert assignments. The World Bank view is that the
proposed new activities could strengthen the off-site supervision which is today largely           '



compliance-based and foster a more proactive and modem supervision, In addition, the
removal o f non core activities will refocus the Banking Supervision department on its key
objectives. As far as validation of supervisory information is concerned, the Eurosystem
report recommends that a dedicated Methodology and IT Working Group (MIT-WG) be in
charge o f designing and building the supervisory information flow. More specifically, the
MIT-WG would analyze the IT supervisory needs (hardware, software, protocol for data
collection and data administration etc.) including the possibility to store all official banking
financial statements.

55.     As a second priority (under the first phase of CBE program) and inline with the new
regulation, banks, especially state-owned banks, would have to improve their systems for
extending credit, reviewing and classifying loans, and defining realistic provisioning needs.
Regardingconnected and directed lending, measures should be taken to ensure that banks
have an independent decision making process that would preclude conflicts o f interest and
enforce arms length lending transactions. Inaddition, specific guidelines would be issued to
improve corporate governance and accountability in state-owned banks and ensure that loans
are made on the basis o f borrower creditworthiness and debt servicing capacity. The third
priority would be to implement an adequate, proactive framework to deal with problembanks
inaddition to astrengthened onsite supervision. Forthispurpose, the off-site supervisionhas
to develop an early warning system with stress testing analysis. More broadly, the project
group on off-site supervision recommended by the Eurosystem has to formalize a new
framework for corrective actions and enforcement.

        (ii)SecondphaseofCBEcapacitybuildingprogram
            -

56.     As a first priority under the second phase of CBE program, efforts should be directed
for strengthening internal control and audit in banks.       To this extent, the Eurosystem
recommends setting up a legal and regulation unit with particular skills in the legal and
accounting fields.     This unit could start working on internal controls in banks and

                                            - 20 -


consolidated supervision.

57.     CBE's second priority (under the second phase) would be to address issues related to
compliance with internal procedures and guidelines and potential for fiaud. Inthis regard, the
CBE would develop specialized IT examinations focusing on such areas as information
system management, computer operations and security, system development and networking.
According to the Eurosystemaction plan, existingpolicies and practices for inspection should
be updated to become forward-looking and risk-based with a focus on new issues such as
operational risk and internal controls. The IT working group has to develop a methodology
for such assistance.

58.     CBE's third priority (under the second phase), in line with the development o f
financial markets, would relate to market risk control.      This analysis will be part of the
responsibilities of the new macro-financial unit recommended by the Eurosystem.               In
coordination with the legal and regulation unit, it will propose regulatory amendments. Inthe
months ahead, the World Bank team will follow up in close coordination with the senior
resident Adviser the implementation o f the action plan approved by the Project Steering
Committee onbankingSupervision.

(b) Insurance sector regulation and supervision
    -

59.     The proposed loan would support the authorities in strengthening the insurance
regulatory and supervisory framework in line with the 2003 IAIS Methodology. Although
insurance supervision in Egypt was deemed "largely compliant" with the 2000 IAIS core
principles based on a relatively enlightened legal structure (which has since introduced
governance concepts), it i s unlikely that Egypt would receive as good an FSAP rating under
the new IAIS Methodology which i s more demanding in such areas as risk management.
Substantial challenges facing the insurance supervisory authority in moving fiom a
compliance approach assuming a largely state owned sector to risk-based supervision system
inamarketenvironmenthavebeenidentified.

60.      USAIDhas committed substantial resourcesto EISA andthe World Bankwas able to
facilitate the allocation of a FIRST Initiative grant - one of the last to a middle-income
country - for a specialized motor third party liability (MTPL) reserving and rate setting
project to support non life technical development within EISA. This will need to be
supplementedby the development o f a mediumterm strategy to put MTPL underwritingonto
a sustainable financial path.    The World Bank team shares the view of the Society of
Actuaries that a higher level of professional expertise i s required for life insurance reserving
and pensions funding level determination, particularly regarding state-owned insurers'
methods to value life insurance mathematical reserves. Strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory regime will largely be pursuedthrough the adoption of a time bound supervisory
development plan (SDP), the provision o f technical assistance by resident advisors to EISA
and the development of the actuarial profession. The Ministryof Investment and the World
Bank agreed that the latter would coordinate with USAlD regarding general supervisory

                                             - 21 -


technical assistance and an on-site advisor has now been placed within EISA. The World
Bankis alsoworking withthe EUto optimize the impact oftechnical assistance.

       B BankingSector Reform
         -
61.    The proposed development policy loan would support the government program inthe
following areas.

(a) Banking sector consolidation
    -

62.     Consolidation of the banking system would partly result from the new level o f
minimum capital requirement set by the regulatory authority. In line with the government
program to reduce the number of banks, several mergers and acquisitions o f small and weak
banks have been conducted, andplans for other mergers are inplace (para. 29). The policy of
consolidation seeks to create out o f the 57 banks that existed in 2004, entities with the
necessary economic scale able to expand the range o f financial services and bank network
beyond today's 3,000 branches - which ranks Egypt inthe lower quintile ina sample of 100
countries, with four branches per 100,000 people. The consolidation drive so far resulted in
bringingthe numberofbanksdownto 43. Underthis policy also, the authorities have decided
to merge the Housing and Development Bank with Egypt Arab Land Bank, and have
announcedthe mergerofBanqueduCaire andBanqueMisr,which would create the country's
largest banking institution (at par with the National Bank o f Egypt interms of balance sheet
size, but well ahead in number o f branches).      The authorities have engaged a leading
international management consultancy firm with experience inmerger to advise on, and help
manage over the next two years, this major undertakingwhich is fraught with risks that must
be, andindeed are, duly acknowledged andmanaged.

(b) Divesture ofstate-owned bank shareholdinginjoint-venture banks
    -

63.     An important component of the reform program - not nearly as publicized as the
proposed privatization o f Bank o f Alexandria (given the latter signaling effect), but with a
broader impact on the ownership and governance structure o f the banking sector - relates to
the full divestiture o f state-owned bank ownership in joint venture banks. Joint venture
companies in the banking and corporate sectors were established over the past three decades
under the provisions of "Law 43 of 1974" - allowing financial andnon-financialinstitutions
to operate as private sector concerns irrespective o f the share o f public ownership therein.
Thus, twenty threejoint venture banks are registered under Law 43, with assets rangingeach
from less than one to over four percent ofbankingsystem assets. Public sector shares inthese
joint-venture banks are heldbypublic sector financial institutions -mainly banks (with shares
in17ofthe largest entities), but also insurancecompanies, andthe NationalInvestment Bank.
The 17joint venturebanks inwhich state-ownedbanks are shareholders account inaggregate
for 20 percent ofthe bankingsystem total. This structure o f ownership hasbeen at the root o f
unwelcome governance and conflict o f interest issues, as the sheer presence of a public sector
bank confers to it a weight in the decision making process that goes well beyond the
ownership stake (majority or minority) in the joint-venture bank. Indeed, although joint-

                                              - 22 -


venture banks are not, inprinciple, subject to centralized management control, their links to
the large public banks translate in weak competition and market segmentation. Effectively,
the public sector dominates the banking system well beyond the 58 percent level. Full
divestiture, by end 2006, o f state-owned bank shareholding in joint-venture banks         -  a
necessary condition to confer full private status to these hitherto de facto largely state-
controlled entities -would alter ina significant way the ownership landscapeand governance
o f the domestic banking system, and reduce indirect state control over, and spur increased
competition in, domestic banking.

64.     To carry out the divestiture program, the authorities - through the CBE's Banking
Reform Unit - have secured advisory assistance for the needed due diligence and pre-sale
preparations. The process i s nearing completion with 12 o f the largest entities already
divested and accounting for some 94 percent o f the total market value o f state-owned bank
ownership in joint venture banks. State-owned insurance company holdings in some joint
venturebanks are not slated for sale, beingconsidered mere portfolio investments creating no
conflict of interest issues. The divestiture scheme injoint-venture banks andthe privatization
of Bank o f Alexandria, together with the program o f bank consolidation, would reduce by
2008, the share of state-owned banks in total deposits from 58 percent to 40 percent, a
sizeable decreaseo fover 30percent.

(c) - Institutionaland   operational restructuring of state-owned banks

65.     The CBE's Banking Reform Unit developed in January 2005, a comprehensive,
strategic, time-lined 4 year plan that covers reforming all business and support units of the
state-owned banks. In that context, the two state-owned commercial banks have been
requested to prepare a detailed business plan based on streamlined operations, optimized
branch network, and strengthenedmanagementstructure. This plani s to include a candid and
detailed assessment of needed professional skills in all critical business areas (front, middle
and back office).      Such exercise is already underway.     The financial restructuring and
recapitalization o f public banks inwhich the state has not declared its intention to divest its
shareholding would be conditional upon a credible institutionaland operational strengthening
planwhich would provide a safeguardthat, inincreasingly open andcompetitive markets, the
restructured institution, within an adequate governance and incentive structure, would be able
to operateon a commercially oriented and soundbasis.

66.     A framework for the institutional andoperational restructuring is outlinedinAnnex II.
Fullimplementation of the planwould call for the involvement of resident banking advisors
along side bank board and management. Grant financing from the EuropeanUnion has been
secured to this effect for two leading international banks to assist the National Bank o f Egypt,
and Banque Misr inthe restructuring process with focus on the critical components related to
humanresources, risk managementand controls, and information technology. Adherence to
the restructuring and business plan would remain under close supervision of CBE acting on
the owner's behalfthroughout the restructuring period. Bank recapitalization as the need may
be, and financial support from the owner would proceed in line with the satisfactory
 implementation o f the operational restructuring plan.       Moreover, the mandate o f the

                                              - 23 -


restructured state-owned institution i s strictly defined under its proposed business plan to
preclude lax lending policies and focus on the bank core business. A pre-condition, duly
highlightedin the government program, for the implementation of financial reforms and for
ensuring a level playing field for all banks, private as well as public, is the existence of a
supportive legal environment andahighdegree o ftransparency.

67.     The authorities have also plansto address under the next phases o f the reformprogram
the institutional and Portfolio issues of the three state-owned specialized banks whereby:
(i) EgyptianArabLandBankistobemergedwiththeHousingandDevelopmentBank;
   the                                                                                           .
(ii) smallIndustrialDevelopmentBankofEgyptisacandidateforacquisitionbyalarger
    the
banking institution; and (iii) activities of the Principal Bank for Development and
                                 the
Agricultural Credit, with assets o f about US$3 billion equivalent, could be separated along
commercially-viable bankingoperations, andbudget-supportedrural development activities.

(d) Bankindependentauditsas a prerequisitefor financialrestructuring
    -

68.     Bank financial restructuring i s closely linked to portfolio quality analysis and
assessment on the basis o f thorough, independent audits of bank portfolios. A necessary
condition for an audit to meet its intended objective inproviding a transparent and reliable
assessment o f a bank position is the full cooperation o f bank management, which the World
Bank team had confirmed.       These audits, financed largely under a U S A D grant, are being
conducted along detailed terms o f reference agreed between the CBE and the World Bank;
they focus on bank portfolio quality and the analysis o f non-performing loans and distressed
assets. These terms o f reference (Annex I) also provide for a diagnostic review addressing
inter-alia the adequacy o f policies and procedures related to lending, credit administration,
risk management, accounting and internal controls. On the basis o f the financial audit, more
accurate estimates of net asset value and revised provisioning needs have been derived,
allowing for the assessment o f bank funding gap, and thus o f the envelop for bank
restructuring costs. The additional capital needed to meet regulatory and prudential rules is
derivedas apercentageofrisk-weighted assets.

(e) -Assumptionofthe       loanportfolioof state-ownedenterprises

69.     The scheme relating to the settlement o f non-performing loans o f state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) has been developed in agreement between the Ministry of Finance, the
Ministry of Investment, the Central Bank of Egypt, and the public sector commercial banks.
(The initialproposalofficially outlinedinthe government "Financial Sector ReformProgram"
o f September 2004, was for public enterprise NPLs to be swapped for long-term obligations
"through issuanceo f 20 years floating rate bonds cross guaranteedby the state-owned holding
companies". The WorldBank team, fiom        the outset, had conveyedits views to the authorities
that, in light o f other country experiences, such swaps are most likely to meet their intended
objectives whenthe NPLs are exchangedfor creditworthy, liquidand earningassets.)

70.         The scheme now retained by the authorities is for the SOEs loans in arrears to be
settled in cash contributed by the Ministryo f Finance. The Government's intention, stated in

                                              - 24 -


the letter o f development policy, is to complete the settlement process as soon as feasible
within the 2005-2008 time frame of the "Financial Sector Reform Program" of September
2004. To fund this scheme, the authorities intend to allocate, inter-alia, the bulk of the
proceeds ofpublic enterprise privatization, as these accrue, to settle these loans inthe amounts
which have been determinedand agreedby the concerned parties. The banksbenefitingfrom
the scheme would pay out to the Ministry of Finance (owner) dividends representedby the
capital gains realized by the banks upon the sale o f non-core assets includingshares injoint-
venture banks being fully privatized. (The solution was already put into effect inthe Bank of
Alexandria and enshrined in a memorandum o f understanding between the Ministry o f
Finance, Ministryo fInvestment andBank ofAlexandria.).

71,     Inthis regard, to ensure that past ills do not reoccur, future relationships of public
sector banks with state-owned enterprises - especially those liable for the large non-
performing loans - will be closely monitored and scrutinized to ensure that lending
transactions are conducted on an arm's lengthbasis along exacting credit standards applicable
equally to all prospectiveprivate or public borrowers. The World Bankteam's review ofbank
portfolio of loans to SOEs providesa good degree of comfort to this effect, as over the past 4
years, public sector banks have hardly extended new financing to defaulting SOEs be that in
the form o f loans or overdraft facilities, Indeed: (i) loans to SOEs show current
                                                           term
maturities rangingfrom 5 to 10years, havingbeen largelycommittedbetween 1996and2001;
while (ii) overdraft facilities show no meaningful transactions in terms o f withdrawals and
reimbursements over the 4-year period. Thus, SOE loans on public bankbooks appear largely
as a stock o f aged loans rather than a grantingo fnew facilities, The Ministryo fInvestment is
leading, along a diligent timetable, the program o f "assets management" of state-owned
enterprises includingprivatization, andoperational andfinancial corporate restructuring.

72.     Beside the SOE non-performing loanportfolio, the authorities are addressingthe asset
quality problems related to the portfolio of public sector bank loans to other borrowers. An
arbitration-based mechanism has been established at the CBE to encourage banks and private
borrowers to reach extra-judiciary settlements for non-performing loans, a mechanism which,
where feasible, has helped streamline the process o f rescheduling non-performing loans, loan
recovery and repossession o f collateral, and avoided the lengthy and cumbersome process o f
court settlement. A period o f four months i s granted for the conciliation mechanism to be
reached, with help as may be requiredfrom the CBE work-out - arbitration unit. Over the 2-
year period 2004-2005, settlements o f arrears under the CBE sponsored mechanism
represented some 46 percent o f the non-SOE NPLs, with total collection amounting to 12
percent of total NPLs. Defining an overall solution to the non-performing private sector
loans, and assessing the net asset value o f the private sector loan portfolio are on the critical
path of the bank restructuring process, and have been a particular focus of the independent
bank audits. The authorities acknowledge the need to relieve state-owned banks from the
burden of non-performing assets, and re-focus management attention on the institution's
future and business perspectives. The authorities have discarded the option of creating an
"asset management company", as well as that o f transferring N p L s to a bank subsidiary. The
optionretained and implementedwas to have the stock o fprivate sectorNPLs within a largely
autonomouswork-out department o fthe bank, with fully dedicatedstaff.

(0- Financialrestructuring ofstate-ownedbanks

73.      The government program seeks to complete the bank financial restructuring process
over a four-year period. The processwould entail schematically two steps. The first wouldbe
to fill the gap (for those institutions that need to restore assets value to that of debt liabilities);
the second, to contribute needed regulatory capital in compliance with prudential
requirements. Restoring the value of bank net assets would entail: (i) resolution o f the
                                                                               the
public enterprise non-performing loans along the scheme outlined in paras. 69-70; and (ii)
possibly, additional government funding to replace part of the non-recoverable loans o f the
private sectorportfolio (taking account o fprovisioningneeds, recoverability andmarket value
o f collateral, andpotential for rescheduling selectedproblemloans) (para. 72).

74.      The authorities need to tread carefully with the pace of financial restructuring, a
potential magnet for two conflicting sets o f issues. Onthe one hand, a quick pace o freform -
rather than long, protracted periods during which restructured institutions are exempt from
prudential standards, particularly in terms of level of provisioning and capital adequacy -
promptly putting back an institution on a sound financial footing would, in itself, be more
likely to achieve the bank restructuring objectives in: freeing management from the angst of
administering ageing arrears to focus on future growth; and providing management the
adequate financial base needed to develop the business in increasingly competitive markets.
On the other hand, experience has shown that contributing fresh funds to a public financial
institution before an adequate governance and incentive structure is put in place, and new,
reliable and effective managerial, operational and financial policies and practices have taken
hold may provide perverse incentives to public bank managers to revert to lax lendinghabits,
rather than promptingthe discipline neededfor their eradication. Inthis instance, the case may
be made, regulatory orthodoxy notwithstanding, that financial support with new capital
injection instate-ownedbanks would have to follow a step-wise approachinlinewith specific
institutional and operational reforms being introduced - defined by quantitative and
qualitative indicators and benchmarks. Moreover, the issue of fiscal affordability should be
addressed, as the pace at which financial restructuring can be effectively implemented will
have to be assessed against the fiscal resources potentially available to support the
restructuringprogram.

(8) Fiscal implications of the government financial reformprogram
    -

75,      It is of critical importance to define and highlight the real fiscal effects ofthe financial
reform program-the main costs o fwhich are those associatedwith the financial restructuring
o f state-owned financial institutions. The Egyptian authorities, in implementing the banking
reform program, would be acting in three different capacities, as: (i)         shareholder o f state-
owned financial institutions; (ii)  lender o f last resort and guarantor o fbank liabilities (all bank
deposits in Egypt are covered by an implicit government guarantee); and (iii) of the    owner
non-financial state-owned enterprises, and therefore ultimately liable for their obligations to
creditor banks. The overall fiscal cost o f the bankingreform program would be the aggregate,
for the state-ownedbanks, of all such sets o f resultinggovernment obligations. The potential

                                                     - 26 -


fiscal cost of the insurance sector restructuring program, yet beingassessed, would have to be
added.

76.     The figures derived from the preliminary results of commercial bank audits put the
aggregatecost o fbankingsector restructuring at about LE50 billion -the breakdown amongst
individual banks will be available by end-May - implyingthat some state-owned commercial
bankshave debt liabilities inexcess of assets value. Basedon the bank financialposition, the
economic losses incurred would be recognized - which, to the authorities' credit, is a crucial
element of their financial reform program - and such losses shared amongst stakeholders.
First the loss inbank equity is borne bythe owner, that is the budget,Furthermore, where net
assets fall short o f liabilities, the blanket, implicit government guarantee - which the
authorities have been keen on reaffirming - extended to all domestic bank deposits would
require the government to cover the shortfall if called upon, which would represent a direct
fiscal charge. Similarly, government's ultimate obligations for the public enterprises' long-
standingarrears vis-his state-ownedbanks are, on a consolidatedbasis, ultimatefiscal costs,
ripe for recognition andoverdue for settlement.

77.     Recognizing thus hidden losses and arrears already incurred by the government as
bank shareholder, deposit guarantor, and ultimate defaulting borrower, does not create or add
a fiscal burdenper se, but merely exteriorizes the hiddencost and makes it explicit. Making
the fiscal picture transparent can be viewed as part o f the broader and parallel budgetary
rationalization process underway in Egypt. This does not imply that the associated fund
outlays would not put a strain on government finances, already stretched; these outlays
therefore would have to be carefully managedinterms ofphasing andinstruments.

78.     The government, to defray the program costs of LE50 billion (US$9 billion
eq~ivalent)'~may, through 2008, count on the following sources of hnds: (i)              up to US$0.8
billion in balance o f payment (grant) support from the U S (against specific benchmarks
expected to be met); and (ii)        US$2.5 billion inprivatization proceeds from the joint-venture
banks and Bank o f Alexandria. The program funding gap would then amount to US$5.7
billion. With a government program to be implemented through 2008, average annual outlays
would be in the range o f US$2 billion, over the next 3 years.                   The budgetary effect of
recognizing the bankingsystem losses, for instance through term borrowings gradually drawn
down would, compared to the 2005 situation: (i)              increase public debt gradually by US$1.9
billion in 2006, US$3.8 billion in 2007, and US$5.7 billion in 2008 - about 7.5 percent
increase over its 2005 level; and (ii)        add US$l50 million in 2006, US$300 million in 2007,
and US$475 million in 2008 in debt servicing costs to the budget. The earmarking o f
proceeds from state-owned enterprise sales (para. 42) to the program o f financial reform
would reduce accordingly the need for debt generating instruments. In this regard, precise
estimates o f sale proceeds from public enterprise privatization cannot be put forth at this
stage.    Yet, in light of the large potential pool of public assets available for sale, a
straightforward extrapolation over the period 2006-2008 o f the sale performance registered
since 2004 (some US$3.2 billion equivalent) would yield estimated privatizationproceeds of


l4Close to the official figure quotedby the President of Egypt inspeechto Parliament

                                              - 27 -


some US$1.5 billion in each of 2006, 2007, and 2008, or US$4.5 billion in aggregate. Were
these sales to materialize, and the bulk be allocated to settling the SOE arrears to the state-
owned banks (para. 70), the banking sector funding gap to be filled through debt generating
instruments would be correspondingly lower, building up to slightly over US$1 billion by
2008.

        C Insurancesector reformand restructuringofpublicinsurancecompanies
           -
79.     The proposed loan would support the implementation of the government insurance
reform program mainly in restructuring the state-owned insurance companies, and
strengtheningthe insuranceregulatory and supervisory framework. The World Bank team, in
close consultation with the Ministry o f Investment, the Egyptian Insurance Supervisory
Authority, and the main insurance companies, carried out an assessment o f the government
program and sought to: (i)     develop, in more details, precise elements o f the restructuring
agenda for the insurance industry; and (ii)  outline a scheme o f technical assistance that could
be provided both for regulatory strengthening and company and industry restructuring. To
this end, the authorities have developed a five-part liberalization strategy for the insurance
sector (para. 81).

80.     The World Bank team's assessment has confirmed that long-term savings and
appropriate intermediation mechanisms are a core need for further economic development in
Egypt. In most transition (and even industrial) economies the financial institutions which
have this keyrole are insurers andprivatefundedpension funds. Egypthashadboth for some
time, although these are relatively small even allowing for the country's current stage of
economic development. The insurance sector should be at least twice its current size given
Egypt's GDP per capita. An attempt has been made to improve the efficiency and dynamism
o fthe insurance sector through opening up the market to foreign competition, most noticeably
with the 1998 legislation which effectively removed all entry restrictions.          This has had
undesirable side effects including excessive price competition (employing capital built up by
the dominant state owned insurers).        The foreign insurers have introduced product and
distribution innovations, particularly in the life insurance market.       However technology
transfer to domestic insurers may have been limited, although there appears to be a growing
 awareness o frisk managementissues.

 (a) Insuranceliberalizationstrategy
    -
 81.    An effective insurance sector liberalization strategy would have five main pillars, in
 addition to opening the market; these would involve the: (i)   restructuring and privatization o f
 state-owned insurance companies along a phasedprogram; (ii)      introductiono f a strongmarket
based (i.e. prudential risk based) regulatory and supervisory regime; (iii)     strengthening of
private sector institutions, andtraining capacity inparticular; (iv) resolution o f failed insurers;
 and (v) determination of government policy with regardto mandatory motor insurance. Of
 these pillars, the first two and fifth are currently seen as the most important in terms of the
 proposed World Bank operation indicators (although trust h d e d support can be brought to
 bear under the other headings). The authorities fully appreciate that liberalization is a multi

                                              - 28 -


faceted activity and, with World Bank and other support, have begun a program to effect the
remaining liberalizationpillars. The liberalization strategyis built on the following:

       (i)- Expeditingprivatizationofthose stateownedinsurersthat canbeprivatized
within the current planninghorizon. This has requiredthe appointment of restructuring and
privatization advisors, with detailed terms o f reference agreed upon between the Ministry o f
Investment and the World Bank. These terms ofreference (Annex IV) lay out a privatization
program involving Misr, A1 Chark and Egypt Re. The privatization o f National Insurance
Company may need to await the development o f the pension strategy, although certain o f its
non-sensitive portfolios could be sold or transferred in the interim. The main tasks for the
advisory consortium in 2006 will be to prepare an owner's due diligence and information
memorandum, balance sheet cleaning, valuation of remaining assets and technical liabilities,
making recommendations about strengthening the management of state-owned insurance
companies andpreparingthe groundwork for the introductionofprivate sector shareholders.

        (ii)Strengtheningtheregulatoryandsupervisoryregime. Thiswouldlargelybe
            -
implemented through the provision of technical assistance to EISA and the development of
the actuarial profession.

        (iii)Strengtheningindustryinstitutions,particularlyvocationaltraining.
            -

        (iv) - Resolution o f insolvent insurers. This would require a review o f relevant
bankruptcylegislation and processes. This issue would not be addressedunder the proposed
World Bank loanbut would be arelevant part o fany further programo f support.

        (v) - Determination o f policy regarding mandatory insurance. Motor Third Party
Liability insurance (ACT insurance) is a loss maker for the insurance sector, and it is likely
that current claims provisions are inadequate (although they currently account for
approximately 50 percent of all insurance technical reserving). As privatization progresses
there will need to be a policy decision as to whether this mandatory insurance should continue
to be subsidized (as it currently effectively i s through the state-owned insurers), or should be
put onto a commercial pricing basis. This class of business is subject to notorious political
economy influence, however there are good examples o f reform available, including
controlling costs through court reform. As a starting point, a technical assessment of claims
provisions and actuarial premiums needs to be carried out. This exercise has begun, with
FIRST fiunding.

82.     Other issues currently being addressedby the industry are premium taxes, for which
amending legislation is underway, and the introduction of brokers. In this latter case the
World Bank team had suggestedmoving slowly, as the loss o f its major accounts could have
unpredictable effects on Misr financial performance in the short term. A possible interim
solution would be to open the market to brokers, but specify that major SOE accountsmust be
placed locally and that intermediaries may offer fee-only services to, say the top 200 state
owned enterprises (commission currently accounts for up to 35 percent o fpremiumcost).

(b) Privatepension system
   -

83.     The pension system is an essential component of the contractual savings scheme. In
the context of the work on the overall pension sector carried out by the World Bank Social
Protection group, a wide ranging program o f reforms has been recommended to place this
potentially important component of the financial sector onto a sound footing and to foster the
growth o f contractual savings.       Specific actions recommended following a subsequent
Financial Sector review o f the private pensions sector (known as Private Insurance Funds)
include inter-alia the carrying out o f a thorough review o f the funding levels (using
international actuarial skills, working with the local actuarial profession), developing a
resolution strategy ifneeded, strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework,
developing a largercadre o f local actuaries trained to do pensionswork (the mandatory review
period was extendedfrom 3 to 5 years because o f a lack o f actuarial capacity), and allowing
outsourcing to professional fund managers and third party administrators, including qualified
insurance companies.

84.     Reform actions related to the private pension funds are fully warranted given the
institutional situation and size o fthese funds, and their significant potentialrole as a source o f
long term investment finds. However the funds, with some exceptions, are not being
optimally run for the benefit o f their members or the country. Current contribution and
investment revenue o f supervised hnds (funds with no employee contributions are not
supervised, and MOI is addressing this shortcoming) amounts to LE 3.5 billion (US$600
million equivalent) with an annual net accrual o f LE 1.6 billion (US$280 million equivalent).
Total invested funds under management as at the end o f 2003 amounted to LE 12.4 billion
(US$2.2 billion equivalent) with 94.5 percent invested in government bonds and special
deposits. Expenserates are excessively highfor a numbero f schemes and there i s a clear case
for outsourcing, particularly for smaller funds.

85.     The majority o f schemes provide defined benefits with supplementary benefits.
Preliminary evidence points to the larger supervised schemes having reasonable actuarial
overview. However a lack o f trained personnel means that reviews may be more cursory for
smaller funds, although EISA does maintain an overview role. It i s likelythat some very large
syndicate funds, which are effectively unsupervised, are severely under-funded.             In the
circumstances there i s a need to carry out a one time actuarial review o f all schemes to
determine funding levels, and if necessary develop a resolution strategy. The source o f
resources for this exercise i s still being determined and will be further discussed with other
donors. In the interim it is highly desirable that all non state funded schemes are brought
underthe supervisionofEISA.

86.     The private pension funds are mostly organized on what is known as a "Deposit
Administration basis" with semi-guaranteed defined retirement benefits (DB) paid as lump
sums and providing a range of ancillary benefits. They are administered by their sponsors or
relevant vocational associations and are subject to out of date law and supporting regulation.
The DBplans are requiredto undergo periodic actuarial reviewbut giventhe shortage of fully
qualified actuaries in Egypt (there are only two qualified to international standards) the bulk

                                               - 30 -


o f the 600 or so reviews fall to two actuaries, who are locally certified. A small number
(approximately 14) o f the supervised funds are substantial, with inexcess o f LE 200 million
under management.

87.      Inthe context of the implementation of the proposed loan, the scope of the pension
reforms would entail the carrying out a funding level investigation and allowing outsourcing
to well qualified financial institutions.

PROGRAMFEATUREAND LOANAMOUNT

88.      The basis to proceed with the development policy loan (DPL) is predicated upon the
authorities' actions regarding: (i)the divestiture o f state-owned bank ownership in joint-
venture banks; (ii)  the privatizationo fthe Banko f Alexandria givenits signaling effect; (iii)
                                                                                              a
credible program o f operational and financial restructuring, with expert assistanceas needed,
of the two remaining state-owned commercial banks; (iv) the design and pace o f the
restructuring and subsequent privatization o f state-owned insurance companies; and (v)
credible programs for capacity building in financial sector regulation and supervision to be
adoptedbythe CBE andEISA.

89.      The proposed DPL would be a single tranche loan in an amount o f US$500 million
equivalent. Disbursement would occur upon Board approval o f the loan, following the
realization o fup-front specific actions (para.9 1).

90.      The government reform program represents a consistent and self-reinforcing package
implemented over the medium term. The proposed single tranche DPL aims at locking in a
set o f irreversible policy measures under the program first phase and at supporting the reform
momentum, while Wher World Bank assistance through follow-up operations would be
decided in light of government actions (outlined in an operational policy matrix provided in
Annex VI>, which require more time to implement, and which will further consolidate the
structural changes in banking and insurance over the 2008 medium-term framework of the
reform agenda. The government position andvision for the sector are laid out anddetailed ina
letter of development policy addressedto the World Bank.

91.      The proposed operation and its presentation for World BankBoard approval would be
conditional upon maintenance o f a sound macro-economic framework consistent with the
objectives ofthe financial sector reformprogram, andcompletiono fthe following actions:

         (i)- Completion ofthe four state-ownedcommercial bank audits byindependent
auditors in accordance with consistently applied auditing standards (terms o f reference

        (viii) - Adoption by the Chairman o f EISA, and start of implementation, of the
development plan to enhance the supervisory capacity of insurance and private pensions in
transition to a risk basedsupervisory regime.

        (ix) - Submission by the Minister o f Investment to the Prime Minister o f draft
insurance sector reform laws regulating stamp duties on insurancepremia, brokers, and motor
thirdpartyliability.

        (x) - Appointment of an investment bank to advise on the restructuring and
privatizationofthe insurance sector, andto conduct the requisite due diligence process (terms
ofreferenceattached).

        (xi) - Preparation by the steering committee for the insurance sector o f a detailed
proposal to set up a state-ownedinsurer holding company.

        (xii) - Submission by: (a) the group of advisors.to the Minister o f Finance, o f a
detailed time bound action plan including monitoringindicators for the ongoing PFM reform
agenda includedinthe 2006-2009 economic reform plan; and (b) the group o f advisors to the
Minister o f Investment, o f the action plan for the enhancement o f corporate financial
reporting.

92.     This operation supportsthe first phase of the government reformprogram which has a
medium-term implementation frame. Follow-up support from the World Bank, beyond the
proposed loan, could be envisaged in line with the progress of structural reforms and
satisfactory implementation of agreed restructuring and capacity building programs, and in
particular: (i) credible measures for addressing the institutional and portfolio problems o f the

                                               - 32 -


state-owned specialized banks; (ii)    achievements relating to the privatization of one state-
owned insurance company (which could include a significant portfolio transfer to a private
insurer or significant part privatization of a state-owned insurer through PO);
(iii)improvement in the institutional framework for the private pension scheme; (iv)
privatization o f additional state-owned financial institutions in the insurance sector; and (v)
reforms aimed at developing non-bank financial institutions in such areas as venture capital,
leasing and factoring. Moreover, while financial and operational restructuring o f the state-
owned banks i s a critical part o f bankingsector reform and strengthening, full success could
also depend on the corporate restructuring of delinquent borrowers, and for which a solid
corporate restructuring strategy is required The development o f such a strategy can also be
part o f follow-up support from the World Bank.


                          VI.    OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION


POVERTYAND SOCIALIMPACTS

93.      There i s a largebody o f researchfindings within and outside the World Bankshowing
that financial sector reforms are demonstrably linkedto growth and poverty reduction. They
are fundamental to reforms in other sectors, including private sector development,
infrastructure, housing and social policies. Strengthening financial infrastructures acts as a
steady promoter o f growth and reduces the frequency and cost of financial crises. Prevention
o f financial crises i s essential to poverty reduction.    For these reasons, building sound,
efficient and inclusive financial systems that work for all memberso f society and that are not
prone to abuse or corruption i s central to the growth andpovertyreduction agenda.

94.      The operation objectives to improve the efficiency o f the financial sector will have a
direct andpositive impact on growth. Through this andpotential follow-up operations, a more
efficient financial sector is expectedto improve savings mobilization and access to finance by
private enterprises -key drivers o f investment and growth -so they may invest and create the
necessaryjobs that raise living standards.

95.      Bank restructuring would normally be associated in the short term with staff
redeployment resultingfrom optimizationo f labor input and skill upgrading. To mitigate thus
the potential social impact o f the restructuring process at Bank o f Alexandria and the other
state-owned commercial banks, voluntary severancepackageshave been offeredto employees
who wish to avail themselves o f early retirement schemes. Training programs are also offered
to staff whose positions at their level o f expertise may be eliminated (para. 107). The
proposed operation concernsbroad strategic reform decisions and would therefore not include
a social protection component, but this would be includedin follow-up operations were these
to have a direct staff redeployment impact that would need to be addressed. Moreover the
proposed operation would have no meaningful impact on clients or social groups that might
be foregoing benefits currently accruing to them from state-owned bankingactivities. Indeed,
state-owned commercial banks had already partedwith government-directed lendingpolicies,

                                              - 33 -


and were no longer extending credit to public enterprises unable to service debt. The
preparation o f the proposed operation has entailed broad discussions with market participants
from all pillars o fthe financial sector.

CONTINUEDBANKDIALOGUEWITH THE AUTHORITIES

96.      The Ministry of Investment and the Central Bank of Egypt will be the two entities
responsible for overall implementation of the proposed operation and for reporting progress
and coordinating actions among other concerned agencies (insurance regulator and capital
market authority). As mentioned inrelation to the outcomes ofthe policyreforms, the World
Bank will monitor actions and review progress of the implementation of the proposed
operation.   At the same time, the overall status of the government's program will be
monitored during supervision to ensure that the reform program is well on track. Inaddition,
supervision missions will allow the Bank to continue the policy dialogue with the institutions
involved inthe implementation of the program of reform, and also ensure the deploymentof
staff and consultants able to advise the government in all o f the policy and technical areas
pertainingto the reforms.

FIDUCIARYASPECTS

97.      ThePublic Financial Management(PFM) system is ina transition phase. The Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), completed in June 2003, rated the overall
fiduciary risk as "significant". Its conclusion took into account the government's sound legal
basis for PFM, its strong ex ante and ex post controls over commitments andexpenditures and
its conservative fiscal management policies.         The CFAA also noted the government's
commitment to improvements, through such areas as its computerized accounting and
reporting system and its plannedinventory managementand control system.

98.      Opportunities to decrease gradually the fiduciary risk are identified and actions axe
taken. A number of areas were identifiedin 2003 as requiring improvement in order for the
government's overall fiduciary risk to become moderate. These included: (i)            a more
comprehensive accounting and reporting entity to cover extra-budgetary funds, quasi-fiscal
activities and contingent liabilities; (ii)
                                          greater focus on the implementation of the automated
government expenditure system for budget preparation, execution, accounting and reporting;
(iii) transparencyinthebudgetingandotherfinancialreportingofthegovernment;
      greater
(iv) the establishment and implementation of a system of modem internal audit;
(v) enhancement of the quality of the external audit function by the Central Audit
Organization including compliance with the standards o f the International Organization o f
Supreme Auditing Institutions (INTOSAI) or the conduct of audits to support an opinion on
the fairness ofthe presentation o f the government's financial statements.

99.      Significant progress has been made in moving with the PFM reform agenda. As part
of the on-going Public Expenditure Review, the Bank conducted an Institutional Financial
Management Capacity Assessment (IFMCA) for the Health, Education, Water and Transport
sectors. As a prerequisite for the sector analysis a review o f the government wide PFM system

                                             - 34 -


including controls and audits, was carried out. The F M C A confirmed that progress has been
made in a number of areas. The 2004105 budget was made public, encouraging public
discussion and debate; the 2005106 budget covers quasi-fiscal activities for payments to state
enterprises and consumers; and a GFS-2001-compliant chart o f accounts is being
implemented inthe same budget, including an 8 chapter classification structure. The Ministry
o f Finance (MoF) has also: begunwork to create a macro-fiscal unit to prepare a multi-year
fiscal and expenditure framework to guide future budget preparation activities; adopted a
policy forbidding state guarantees for state enterprises; set up revenue estimation model; and
establish an Internal Audit unit. A move towards greater transparencywas noticed through
the publication by the MoF, of the Financial Monthly Report and its availability on the
website o f the MoF. The report includes data ranging from general economic and financial
data, Government debt, monetary sector, financial sector and investment to comparative
analysis. The Government indicated its willingness to pursue further PFM reforms in future
years and sharedwith the World Banlsa detailed timeboundaction plan.

100.    The MoF is monitoring the progress of the reform agenda and reasonable
improvements are occurring. The new quarterly Economic Monitoring Report includes a
summary o f the ongoing keyreforms areas andprogress achieved. The summary is supported
by a detailed 4 year (2006-2009) time bound action planled by the MoF, with benchmarks,
expected Completion dates and budget estimation. The actions aim at improving: tax policy
analysis, and revenue estimation, control on tax collection, modernization o f budget process
including cashmanagement and expenditure policy, establishmento f a debt managementunit,
and accuracy o f shareddata and financial information. Materialprogress inthese areas could
lead to a reduced fiduciary risk to 4410w-moderate"level inthe horizono f2008-2009.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

101. The proposed Financial Sector DPL will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures
for development policy lending. The amount will be disbursed in one tranche in the full
amount o f the loan, against satisfactory completion o f the actions listed inparagraph 91 and
Government agreement on the medium term framework o f policy and institutionalreforms as
summarized inthe letter of developmentpolicy.

 102.   Flow o f funds (including foreign exchange) i s subject to normal FM processes. It is
not possible to track the ultimate use o f the foreign exchange providedby the DPL proceeds,
but loanproceeds flow into adedicatedaccount at the CBE andfrom it to Egypt's budget, and
are thus subject to normal public financial management processes and CBE procedures. By
way o f a letter, the Government will provide confirmationto the Bank when the loan amount
                    -
has been credited to an account used to finance budgeted expenditures. The diagram below
                                                                  -
depicts the envisagedflow of funds arrangements:

103.    The Bank will request the auditors of the CBE to conduct a special audit of the
dedicated account establishedinthe CBE. The audit will cover the accuracy of the summary
o f transactions of the dedicated account, includingaccuracy o f exchange rate conversions; the
dedicated account was used only for the purposes of the operation where no other amounts
have been deposited into the account, including obtaining confirmations from corresponding
bank(s)involvedinthe funds flow. The audit should be conducted six months after the funds
inthe dedicated account have been fully utilized. The timeperiodfor submission ofthe audit
report to the Bank i s three months.

ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS

104.    The policies supported by the proposed adjustment development policy loan are not
likely to have any significant direct effects on the environment and natural resources. In
addition, the indirect impacts that the DPL is likelyto have on the environment are difficult to
predict but are expectedto bemarginal.

RISKS AND RISI( MITIGATION

105.    The financial sector dialogue conducted in Egypt over the past year has allowed for
differences between the authorities and the World Bank to be narrowed down, and for a
common view to emerge on a number o f sector policy issues and orientations largely
embodied in the government "Financial Sector Reform Program". There has been a broad
agreementon the substance anddesign o fthe operation components, the scope o fWorld Bank
assistance, and the need to proceed diligently with the reform program. Actions on these
components are, overall, progressing satisfactorily (para. 6). The sharedunderstandingon the
reform strategy and the role o f the World Bank would reduce, but not eliminate, the risks for
divergingpositions as to the implementation of the strategy. Other development partners, in
particular USAID, the European Union, and the AfDB are supporting the objectives of the
proposed operation and have indicated their intent to continue their financial and technical
assistance to the authorities in the financial sector. The components o f the reform program
centered on changes in the regulatory and supervisory frmework require no large public
outlays. The design and pace o f operational and financial restructuring o f the state-owned
financial institutions, especially banks, do however entail fiscal outlays resulting from the
recognition o f system losses. Implementation of the program would therefore have to reflect
fiscal affordability (paras. 75-78), especially that fiscal consolidation appears as an overriding
policy challenge over the next few years.        Moreover, the challenges associated with the
restructuring and modernization of state-owned banks not slated for medium-term
privatization - and their capacity to operate effectively and competitively under a
commercially-oriented management- are well documented. The risk therefore o f suboptimal
use o f public funds to shore up their balance sheet structure should not be overlooked or
underestimated. The associatedrisks andproposals for their mitigation are discussedbelow.

reform which should be duly considered. The budget deficit and public debt in Egypt, while
still manageable, are relatively high and may not be sustained at current levels without

                                               - 36 -


compromising the country's economic potential. Fiscal deficit is estimated at 9.6 percent of
GDP in fiscal year 2005106 and net government debt at 76 percent of GDP. The recent tax
reforms were an important development andneed to be complemented by a credible medium-
term fiscal consolidation strategythat putspublic debt as a share o f GDP on a firmly declining
path. Inthis regard, the authorities' announcedmedium-termstrategy (para. 17) to reducethe
fiscal deficit, by over 5 percentagepoints over 5 years, to 4 percent o f GDP in2010111,would
be a fiscal adjustment program o f a major magnitude, the feasibility of which requires
considerable efforts, determination and effective social consensus building. The strategy
entails a range of expenditure (including subsidy) reduction, and revenue and efficiency
enhancing measures. The risks, uncertainties and challenges that may affect the
implementation o f the strategy are non-trivial and must be acknowledged. The addedburden
o f bank restructuring on the fiscal position over the period 2006-2008 would be partially
offset by the public enterprise privatization proceeds - although the argument can then be
made that such proceeds would, ceteris paribus, be foregone as budgetaryreceipts. Although
precise figures in this regards cannot be put forth at this stage (para. 78), the risk that such
proceeds may not materialize is low given: (a) the record o f diligent and effective
privatizations that the government has recently established; and (b) the large potential pool of
assets available for sale, o f which some 100 entities are currently offered. The government
fiscal adjustment program will be monitored closely and the government and the World Bank
will consult on furtheractions, ifrequired, to maintain the fiscal stance on a sustainablepath.

risk could be that social, political and stakeholder opposition would weaken government
resolve to pursue the neededmacroeconomic and structural reforms (a vocal media opposition
has taken aim at the government privatizationprogram). Measures to mitigate such riskshave
been considered under the banking sector reform program. Where labor redeployment i s
envisaged, contingency financing in terms o f voluntary early retirement and compensation
schemes hasbeenplannedto alleviate the resulting social burden. Indeed, a voluntary and, by
its results and other accounts, attractive retirement scheme has been offered in the Bank o f
Alexandria (on the way to be privatized); the funding dedicated to this first wave o f departure
was fully spent. As a result o f the scheme and natural attrition, the bank labor force was
reduced by over 25 percent over the 3-year pre-privatization period. Moreover, Bank o f
Alexandria's privatization strategy has allocated 5 percent o f the shares of the bank to its
employees, building thus an internal base o f support for privatization. Similar schemes for
voluntary retirement are also offered at the National Bank o f Egypt and BanqueMisr-Banque
du Caire, coupledwith stafftraining and skills upgrading for employeeswhose current profile
may not readily fit inthe organization chart o fthe restructured and mergedinstitutions.

108.     (iii)State-ownedbankrestructuringandrecapitalizationwithoutprivatization. The
              -
financial restructuring o f public banks in which the state has not declared its intention to
divest its shareholding entails serious risks that the restructured institutionmay not be able to
depart from old lax management and lending practices that had been at the root o f current
problems, The history o f public sector bank restructuring i s replete with cases o f bank
recapitalization that had gone awry - sometimes entailingrepeatedwaves o f financial support
that fail to shore up the bank's position on a sustainedbasis. A recipe for fiscal waste at best,

                                            - 37 -


such unconditional financial support may provide bank managementwith the wrong signal to
pursue their past and costly lending practices. To reduce this potent risk, any financial
restructuring and recapitalization plan would be made contingent upon, and would be
implemented in step with, the progress of the capacity building program (within a frame
agreed with the World Bank) that seeks a strengthening of the bank governance, and an
overhaul o f lending and risk control practices - although this would imply that the
restructured institutions would be exempted from compliance with prudential standards and
regulatory requirements through the restructuring period.         Full implementation of the
institutional and operational restructuring plan is a critical part, and a specific focus o f the
banking sector reform program, and for which important hnding has been earmarked to
secure expert assistancefrom leading international banks, (The advisory services of a leading
international management consultancy firm have also been secured to assist in the planned
merger of Banque Misr and Banque du Caire which is a major undertaking that requires
carefil and expert management). The implementation o f these restructuring plans would
remain under close supervision o f CBE (acting on the owner's behalf) throughout the
restructuring period. Bank recapitalization and financial support fiom the owner would
proceed inlinewiththe satisfactory implementation o fthe operational restructuringplan.

109.    (iv) - Building credible and independent reaulatorv authorities. The credibility and
independenceo f the regulator is the base uponwhich a resilient financial systemmay emerge.
The risks associatedwith this component relate to the authorities' ability, within the program
timeframe, to build the capacity and implement the strengthened regulatory and supervisory
framework. These risks will be mitigatedby supporting, inter-alia through resident external
expertise, the bankingand insurance supervisors' on-going efforts to implement the programs
that have beendevised (andagreedwith the World Bank).

                                          ANNEX I:
             Termsof Referencefor a "ComprehensiveIndependentAudit ofState-owned
                                             CommercialBank"


                                       I Introduction
                                         -
1.      As part o f the government "Financial Sector Reform Program", the Central Bank of
Egypt and <XU---Bank> seek to engage the services o f an international auditing firm (the
Auditor) to conduct a comprehensive independent audit and diagnostic study of a state-owned
commercial bank (the Bank), and as the case may be, its group of subsidiaries and their
consolidated position. The audit and diagnostic study performed, and the opinions and reports
provided by the Auditor will be in accordance with the recommendationsof the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB), unless otherwise specified inthese terms o f reference. In
thisregard, you are invitedto submit aproposalandwork planfor conducting the audit.

2.      This engagement should be carried out by staff with appropriate professional
qualifications and expertise, including experience in assessing credit quality and auditing the
accounts of entities comparableinnature, size, andcomplexity, The Auditor should provide the
CVs o f the principals o f the firm who would be responsible for providing the opinions and
reports, together with the CVs of managers, supervisors, and key personnel involved in the
assignment. CVs should include details on audits carried out by such staff, including ongoing
assignments. To the extentjudged appropriate, the Auditor mayproposeto engage the services
o fspecializedlocalor internationalauditors to reinforce the teamwhichisto examinethe Bank's
loan portfolio quality and administration process. Given its primary responsibility for the
assignment, the Auditor should exert due quality controlo fthe work performedbysuch firms, in
terms of approach and methodology, and guarantee the quality o f their performance. It is
understood that the primary responsibility for the review o f the quality of the Bank's loan
portfolio will be assigned to a professional with substantial banking experience in credit
assessment, and that the rest o f the audit team under his (her) direction will have appropriate
experienceincredit assessment ofportfolios o fsimilar complexity.

3.      The Auditor will provide independent opinions and related reports for the financial
statements of the fiscal year endedDecember 31,2004 for the Bank, andas the case may be, its
subsidiaries and the consolidated position of the Banks group. To this effect, the Bank will
provide the Auditor with the following consolidated statements for the fiscal year to be audited:
(i) Sheet;(ii) andLossstatement;(iii)
   Balance              Profit                           Statement o f Changes in Shareholders'
Equity; (iv) Statement of Sources andApplications of Funds; (v) Statementof Past Due, Non-
performing, and Renegotiated Loans and Advances; (vi) Statement o f Provisions for Losses,
Write-offs, and Recoveries; and (vii) Statement o f Commitments and Contingencies. Other
statements, reports, and supplementary data would also be made available ifdeemed necessary
bythe Auditor inorder to renderopinions, conduct diagnoses, andotherwise complywith these
terms of reference. The Auditor may proposeinwriting all those changes to the presentterms o f
reference as the Auditor maythink are appropriategiventhe circumstances.

                       I1 GeneralScopeofAudit andDiagnostic Study
                         -

4.      The audit of the financial statements and the diagnostic review should be carried out in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards of field work and reporting. The audit
should indicate: (i)the extent that the Auditor could not conform to the standards; (ii) extent
                                                                                       the
that the standards the Auditor proposes to use do not conform to the auditing standards of the
International Federationof Accountants; and (iii)  any alternative standards to which the Auditor
proposesto conform.

5.      The audit should be planned and conducted on the basis of a program sufficiently
expansiveincovering the Bank's activities to enablethe Auditor to signthe opinions andreports
required as per section E! o f these terms o f reference. In devising the diagnostic review, the
Auditor is required to take into consideration the effectiveness and reliability o f the Bank's
accounting and administrative procedures, as well as the financial and administrative internal
controls and procedures. Under the proposed scope o f work, the Auditor is required to provide
specific commentsonthe following areas.


6.      Independenceandhpartialitv. At the time of submissionof aproposal andwork planto
carry out the diagnostic audit, your firm must be independentof any member of the board o f
directors, executive officer, or senior manager o fthe bank. Independenceimplies that the senior
managingpartner, andanypartner, or staffwho would be involved inthe diagnostic audit, isnot
serving as a director of the bank, nor has any personal, financial, or close businessrelationship
except as anindependentprofessionaladviserduringthe courseofan audit.

        A Accounting policies and procedures
           -
7.      The Auditor should comment on the accounting principles adoptedby the Bank and its
subsidiaries, particularly to: (i)confirm whether and to what extent generally accepted
accounting principles and accounting standards have been and are being consistently applied;
and (ii) indicate specifically the reliance on other principles and their effect on the annual
financial statements.

      3 -Internalcontrol    policies and procedures

8,      The Auditor should determine that: (i) are being appropriately safeguarded; (ii)
                                                 assets
expenses are being controlled; (iii)    adequate and comprehensive policies exist, have been
approvedbymanagement andthe Boardo fDirectors, are documentedinwriting, andhave been
disseminatedwithin the Bank; (iv) transactions have been executed inaccordance with Written
policies; and (v) all transactions have been recorded to pennit timely preparation o f financial
statements inaccordancewith generally acceptedaccountingprinciples.

        C Internalcontrolsystems
           -

9.      The systems of internal controls and checks, including internal auditing, should be

                                                - 40 -


reviewed and evaluated in order to determine the degree of reliance that can be placed upon
them, and the extent of testing and verification that needs to be performed by the Auditor.
Regardless o fwhether the Auditor intendsto relyor not on the existing internal control systems,
the Auditor will report those weaknesses detectedthat accordingto the volume and complexity
of transactions and their risk profile, have to be corrected in order to ensure prudent detection,
measurement, managementandcontrol o foperational, credit andmarketrisks.

10.     The Auditor will provide a specific opinion on the adequacyof internal control systems
and procedures in place, including written policies and procedures, accounting and
administrative controls, budgeting, internal audit, andmanagement information systems. To the
extent that weaknesses are detected, appropriate recommendations should be made on how to
strengthen or correct existingsystems.

        D Asset qualityreview
          -

11.     The Auditor will assess the quality o f assets andthe impliedrisk profile o fthe Bank and
provide a specific opinioncommenting onthe reliabilityo fthe statedvalues ofthe Bank'sassets.
This assessment should include not only loans but all other extensions o f credit (on and off-
balance sheet) and the Bank's investment portfolio. In a first phase o f the analysis the focus
would be on credit exposureto private sector borrowers. Inmakingthe assessment, the Auditor
shouldconsider specifically, the following:

12.     (a) - Classification of assets held by the Bank. The Auditor will ensure that the
classification o f assets is based on qualitative criteria and agreed def~tions,and that adequate
consideration has been givento: (i)    the level, distribution, and severity o f classified assets; (ii)
the level and composition of non-accruing, non-performing, and reduced rate assets; and (iii)
undue concentrations of credit. Assets should thus be categorized as performing or non-
performing, and risk-classified irrespective o f whether they are overdue for payment. Problem
assets should be placed in risk classifications according to specific criteria for "substandard",
"doubtfbl", and "loss" categories(as per attachedannex). Assets shouldbe categorizedbasedon
ownership and corporate structure. All credit to an individualborrower (or to a related group of
borrowers) should be placed inthe same risk classification; different classifications should be
specifically noted and justified. Actual and potential losses should be clearly identified,
distinguishingtheirimpact uponreservesandtheprofit andloss account.

13.     (b) - Selectionof loans andother assets for review. Inassessingthe qualityofassets, the
Auditor should assure not less than 75% coverage of the portfolio of loans, advances, and all
other similar credit risks, including guarantees, open letters of credit, and similar off-balance
sheet credit risk items. The review, in a first stage, would start by the assessmentofthe largest
borrowers, onwhich the Banknormally maintains current data, information and analyses. The
aggregate value of the largest (say fifty) loans would be expected to represent a meaningfbl
share of the total portfolio. Each such loan would be first classified conventionally
(documentation, payment performance, collateral, current profitability of the borrowing entity,
and any special known problems). Typically, the Auditor will examine and appraise all loans,
advances and guarantees to a single obligor or related group of obligors which exceed a cutoff

                                               -41 -


amount equal to one-half ofone percent ofpaid-upcapital andretained earnings. Past due loans
and advances, renegotiated loans and advances, internally identified problem loans and
advances, loans and advances to insiders, and their related interest, investments, equity
participations, inter-bank loans and money market claims, foreclosed or repossessedproperties,
contingent liabilities and guarantees, and miscellaneous assets should also be appraised. In
addition, a sample of loans and advances below the cutoff amount, not otherwise selected for
review, shouldbeappraisedandthe resultsofthat appraisalextrapolatedto the loanportfolionot
otherwise examined.

14,     (c) - MethodolomandCriteria for asset quality review. Inassessingthe quality ofassets,
primary emphasis should be placed upon the borrowers' ability to repay debts and support
interest service andprincipal repaymentsout o fprospective operating cashflows. To this effect,
the Auditor would be expected, especiallyinthe case of large borrowers, to comment onthe: (i)
adequacy o f the borrower prepared projections to identify kture cash flows to service total
indebtedness; (ii)  appropriateness o f the assumptions relied upon inthese projections; and (iii)
process by which the Bank evaluates the borrower's projections and subjects them to rigorous
sensitivity analyses. Collateral support should normally be of secondary importance. To the
extent, however, that the Bankrelies on collateral as the primarysource ofpayment, the Auditor
will ensure that appropriate appraisal procedures have been followed, including updated
appraisals o f such collateral, andthat the existing documentation andlegalproceduresallow the
Bank to realize, without protracted delays, the estimated value of the collateral. when the
primarysourceofrepaymentis supportedbysecondaryguarantees grantedbyother localbanks,
the Auditor should evaluate the likelihood of those guarantees being executed because o f the
problematic situation o fthe final borrower, andthe prospects for those banksbeingableto serve
those guarantees.

15.     (d) - Concentrationofcredit exposure.The Auditor wouldidentify, quantifyandappraise
the concentration of credit with particular emphasis on credit extendedto: (i) insiders andtheir
related interests; (ii)
                      connectedparties; and (iii) economic sectors. For the purpose of this
                                                   major
review, related or connectedborrower concentrationsrepresenting5% or more of capital or 5%
ofuncoveredportfoliowhichever is less, or industryconcentrationsrepresenting 10% or moreof
capital or 10% of uncoveredportfolio whichever is less should be specifically detailed, as well
as exposures representing30% or more o f total portfolio by Risk Rating. Borrowers should be
considered "related" based on common ownership, inter-company dependence, or common
sources o f repayment. "Connection" implies the ability to exert control or influence policy and
decision-making, especially on credit decisions. (Connected parties or firms typically include a
firm's parent, major shareholders, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, directors, and executive
officers.) The status o f each individual concentration exceeding the 5% level will be analyzed.
Inthis case, the Auditor should comment onthe borrower's performance andthe probabilityof
repayment according to the existing terms of the loans. The Auditor should comment on the
adequacy of the Bank`s current policies, practices, and procedures to identify common
ownership, control, and reliance on common cash flows. The Auditor should also comment on
the Bank's ability to identifyandtrack extensions o f credit to insiders andwhether these credits
are based on market terms or whether they are granted on terms more favorable (availability,
tenor, rate, collateral, risk tolerance) than those provided to the general public. The Auditor

                                                - 42 -


should also, ifappropriate, suggest new guidelines and new proceduresbywhich concentrations
shouldbe identifiedandtrackedinthe Bank.

16.     (e) - Adequacy of loss reserves and additional capital needed for regulatory compliance,
The Auditor will assess the adequacyof the reserves for loanlosses andother valuationreserves,
andprovide anopinionas to the adequacyof capital. To the extent that capital is inadequateto
support present and future operations, the Auditor should recommendthe amount of additional
capital required on the basis o fthe relevant regulationsestablishedbythe Central BankofEgypt.
The analysis would take into account, inter-alia, the adequacy o f provisions for losses, and
adjustments necessary to bring valuation reserves to adequate levels. To this end, the Auditor
should outline the methodology used to determine the level of reserve adequacy, including the
amounts set aside as specific reserves and general reserves, and the extent of reliance on
collateral for establishing the recommended reserves. In this regard, the analysis should
specifically state the amount o f reserves required without collateral reliance, and the amount
requiredwith collateralreliance andthe basisuponwhich collateralhasbeenvalued.

17.     (Q - Qualitv of earnings. The Auditor will assess the reliability and composition of the
Bank's reported earnings for the period reviewed.         The Auditor thus should specifically
comment on: (i)   the extent to which accrued but uncollected interest is taken into income -
especially when suchinterest income relates to loanswhich the Auditor, or the Bank, hasplaced
into substandardrisk category or below; (ii) extent to which collateral values (rather than
                                                the
operating cash flows) are the basis for decisions to capitalize interest andor to roll-over
extensions of credit; (iii) capitalization o f expenses; and (iv) any other income recognition
policies which could distort earnings. On the basis o f the analysis, the Auditor would
recommend, as needed, adjustments to the profit and loss statement for interest taken into
income on non-performing assets, as well as for past due interest which has been capitalized,
renegotiated, or refinanced.

        E!. Adequacy of, and adherenceto, lendingand credit administration policies
           -
18.     The Auditor would make an assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of, and
adherenceto, operationaland lending policies, andcredit administration procedures. This would
include policies and procedures for approving credit and establishing and enforcing repayment
programs, collecting past due loans, provisioningfor actual and potential losses, writing-off of
bad assets, debt recovery, and managementreporting, Where deficiencies have been identified,
the Auditor would make recommendations for strengthening the policies and correcting the
weaknesses.

19.     More specifically, the Auditor should provide a comprehensive evaluation of the
capacity ofthe Bankto assess, administer, superviseandrecover loans, advances, guarantees and
other investments, as well as an evaluation of the B d s current credit procedures and
organization, including: (i) standard loan process from client's initial enquiryto final lending
                            the
decision; (ii)formalized credit policies, procedures, and underwritingcriteria; (iii)adequacy of
financial information received from the borrower and analyzed by the Bank as the basis for
credit extension and for periodic assessment o f the changing risk inherent in the credit;

                                                 -43 -


(iv) specific lending procedures and techniques for project appraisal, approval and legal
finalization o f projects, procurement, disbursement, and follow-up; (v) lending organization
covering relevant departments and staffing includingprofile and skills of chief lendingofficers,
credit managers and officers; (vi) internal loan review process, internal risk categories, and
procedures for managementof problem loans; (vii) specializedwork-out units including scope,
skills, resources, and efficiency; and (viii) mechanisms for legal recovery, foreclosure and
repossessiono f collateral, andtransmissionof legalrights.

        F Interestrate, foreign exchangeandliquiditypositions
           -

20.     The Auditor would be required to appraise and report on the adequacy of, and
compliance withpolicies andproceduresfor assets andliabilities management, includinginterest
rate, liquidityand foreign exchangerisk exposures. The Auditor, where relevant, will assess and
report on the existenceof adequate tradinglimits andcontrols, segregationofduties, accounting
andrevaluationprocedures, andmanagementreportingrequirementsandsystems.

21.      The Auditor should report significant exposures to changes in interest rates, and
comment uponproceduresandcontrols inplace to manageinterestraterisk.

22.      The Auditor should evaluate the Bank's foreign exchange risk, determine the profile o f
openpositions andtheir evolution, andassessthe controls andproceduresinplace to managethe
associatedrisk.

23.      The Auditor should assess and comment on the Bank's liquidity both in terms o f the
ability to manage asset and liability positions, and generate operating cash flows sufficient to
cover operating cash expenses. The Auditor should also comment ifliquidity support is being
provided by any organization, bank or financial institution, or the government, and the relative
impact there from upon the Bank interms ofprofitability, liquidity, andinterestrate and foreign
exchangerisk exposures. More specifically, inassessing liquiditymanagementrisks, the Auditor
should consider: (i) the volatility o f deposits; (ii) reliance placed on interest-sensitive funds;
                                                     the
(iii) accesstomoneymarketsorotherreadysourcesofcash;(iv)theabilitytoconvertassets
     the
readily into cash; (v) the capacityto meetunexpecteddepositwithdrawals andother demands for
payment; (vi) the abilityto satisfy reasonablecredit demands readily; (vii) the financial strength
of clients related to off-balance sheet liabilities and the prospects andtiming for possible draws
on guarantees and other off-balance sheet items; (viii) the overall adequacy, effectiveness, and
compliance with liquiditymanagementpolicies; and(ix) the nature, volume, and anticipated use
of credit commitments, contingent liabilities, and guarantees. W e r e deficiencies have been
identified, the Auditor should recommend measures for strengthening or correcting the
weaknesses inthe Bank's managementandmonitoringo f its liquidityposition.

         G Verification oftitle to, andvalue of, fixed assets
           -

24.      To the extent that fixed assets are material to the total assets and to the capital o f the
Bank, the Auditor will verify that the Bank has clear and unobstructed title to these assets.
Specifically, it is anticipated that the Auditor will conduct (or have conducted on the Auditor

                                              - 44 -


behalf) a review o f alltitle documentationandrelevant landregistries. The Auditor will provide
an opinion onthe status ofthe title to fixed assets.

25.     To the extent that the value of fixed assetsis material to the total assets andto the capital
of the Bank, the Auditor will verify the reasonableness ofthe values assignedto fixed assets. To
this end, the Auditor will: (i) the methodology by which values havebeen assigned, and
                               identify
(ii)reconcile historical costs to existing book values. Finally, the Auditor will confirm (by
separate appraisal basedon comparable sales or another acceptedmethodology) that the values
assignedprovide a realistic measureof realizable values and that the values assigned are not so
distorted that they may infact distort the Bank'sstatedcapital levels.

        H Equityposition
           -

26.     The Auditor will review the equity accounts o f the Bank and verify existing equity
levels. The Auditor, as the need may be, will address the status of capital subscriptions and
identifyand comment on the value of all capital contributions which may have beenmade ina
form other thancash.

        I Adjustments
          -

27.     The Auditor should provide a detailed listingof adjustments required inorder to ensure
that the financial statements accurately and fairly represent the financial position and
performance o f the Bank. Adjustments may include additional provisions to the loan loss and
other valuation reserves, the suspension or reversal o f interest accrual on loans and advances
which are judged to be non-performing, assets which are to be written-off, foreign exchange
losses, income which i s to be restated, or any other reclassifications and adjustments which
materially affect the financial statements. (For reporting on individual reclassifications and
adjustments, materiality will be kept at the 2% level o fthe Bank'snet worth for balanceandoff-
balancesheet relatedadjustments, and 1% for the profit andloss account.)

28.     The Auditor should provide a detailed listing of asset and liability items which, afier
adjustments, are still carried in the fmancial statements at amounts which may diRer
significantly from realizable values. The Auditor should provide also a detailed listing o f
revenue and expense items which, after adjustments, may still be significantly over or
understated.

29.     The Auditor, at the completion o fthe review, willprovide the CentralBanko fEgyptand
<XYZ---Banbwith the following reports:

30.     (a) - Annual consolidated statements, after appropriatereclassifications and adjustments.
These statements (referred to in para. 3 o f these terms o f reference) after appropriate
reclassifications and adjustments, should include extensive notes on balance sheet and income
statement items explaining the accounting methodologies used, and clarifymg any items which,

                                                -45 -


inthe Auditor's view, could, inthe absence of anote, mislead areader accustomedto financial
statementspreparedaccordingto generally acceptedaccountingprincipals.

31.     (b) - Statements on specific investments. The Auditor should provide individual
statements for each of the investments in which: (i)    the Bank's direct or indirect participation
exceeds 20%; and (ii)    the total risk to the Bank exceeds 5% of the Bank's equity. Financial
subsidiariesinwhich the Bank holds a direct or indirect participation o fmore than40% will be
consolidated (financial subsidiaries are those entities the main activities of which include
holdings o f financial instruments, leasing, capital and money market activities, insurance and
real estate activities). The consolidatedstatements of the subsidiaries should also be auditedor,
alternatively, the Auditor should obtain reports fiom secondary auditors, guaranteeing the
application of similar audit and accounting standards as those applied to the Bank.
Consolidation of subsidiaries should be based on the application of a standardized package
designed to homogenize reports and opinions rendered by secondary auditors used for such
purposes. The Auditor will specifically report on any limitation to the engagement found in
relation to the consolidation scope, or any exclusion thereof which the Auditor may judge
necessary.

32.     (c) - Opinion on the accuracy and reliability of the accounting system. The opinion on
the accuracy and reliability of the Bank's accounting system would either: (i)    indicate that the
financial statements accurately reflect the performance o f the Bank.during the period under
review and the financial condition as of the end o f the review period; (ii) a qualified
                                                                               provide
opinionstating clearly the extent to which the statementsmaynot accuratelyreflect the financial
position and performance of the Bank; or (iii)       state the circumstances which preclude the
Auditor renderinganunqualifiedopinion or statingthe basiso fspecific qualifications.

33.     (d) - Diamostic studies andsupporting schedules. The diagnostic studies andsupporting
scheduleswill address the following: (i)   accounting policies andprocedures; (ii) control
                                                                                   internal

                                            Appendix


                          Definitionsfor Gradingthe QualityofAssets


1.      In order to determine the quality of the loan portfolio, as well as other assets and
off-balance sheet contingent liabilities, it is first necessary to establish criteria by which to
evaluate assets. Ingeneral, this criterion is used to assess the borrower's fmancial capacity and
ability to repay. Many countries have adopted a system o f classification in which assets are
classified as current, substandard,doubtful, or loss.

2.      Those assets which are considered current do not exhibit credit weaknesses that might
jeopardize collection of the debt inthe manner agreed to upon the loan's inception. Such loans
are properly structured so that repayment is effected in a timely and realistic manner and are
otherwise soundineveryrespect. Inessence, they are goodloansto good enterprises.

3.      Assets which do not have well-definedcredit weaknesses, butwhich exhibit more than a
normal degree o f risk may be criticized as especially mentioned. These assets may be poorly
structured, show declining trends, or exhibit other characteristics which increasethe risk of non
payment.

4.      The latter three categoriesare consideredproblem assets. Their definitions follow:

        A substandard asset is one which has a well-defmed credit weakness, or
        weaknesses, which jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt. It is inadequately
        protectedbythe soundnet worth or payment ability ofthe borrower. Substandard
        assets are characterizedbythe distinct possibility that the bankwill sustainsome
        loss if the credit weakness is not corrected. Lass potential, while existing inthe
        aggregate amount o f substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual
        assets classified substandard.

5.      For example, a substandardborrower is one whichlacks adequatecashflow to service or
repay its currently maturing debts. This credit weakness may be determined from an actual lack
o f performance or it may be concluded on a prospective basis through an analysis of the
enterprise's financial statements. In some instances, borrowers may appear to perform on their
debts but in fact do not. It is only through the capitalization or refinancing o f interest which is
dueandunpaidthat the loanappearscurrent.

         A doubtfulasset has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard
        with the added characteristicthat the weaknesses make collection or liquidation
         in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly
         questionableandimprobable.

 6.      One example of a doubtful asset is a loan which exhibits the characteristics o f a
 substandard asset but which is also seriously past due and inadequately protected by the

                                             - 4 8 -


realizable value ofany collateral pledged. For example, assume that inventory is the sole asset of
an enterprise pledged as collateral. Its sale under distressed conditions or during a forced
liquidation might only bring a fi-action of its original cost in real terms, thus significantly
exposing the credit to a high probability of loss. As the result, the ultimate collection of the
indebtedness in full would be considered highly unlikely if the borrower were also seriously
delinquent andunable to provide additional security.

       Assets classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that
       their continuance as bankable assets is notwarranted. This does not meanthat the
       asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or
       desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial
       recovery maybe effectedinthe future.

                                          ANNEXII:
                  Frameworkfor "InstitutionalandOperationalStrengtheningof State-
                                         ownedCommercialBank"

                                        I Introduction
                                         -

1.       The banking sector in Egypt consists o f 43 banks, with public, mixed, or private
ownership. There are fully-licensed foreign banks, as well as representativeoffices andbranches
of foreign banks. Four state-ownedcommercial banksaccount for some 55% o fbankingsystem
assets (three state-owned specialized banks account for some additional 6% o f sector assets).
The reforms initiated over the past few years -inparticular the enactment o f the new "Central
Bank,BankingSystemandMoneyLaw", the floating ofthe Egyptiancurrency, the liberalization
of interest rates, and the strengthening o f monetary policy framework - set the stage for the
development o f a more efficient banking system. At present, however, state-owned banking
institutions still exhibit weaknesses related inter-alia to doubtful portfolio quality, inadequate
financial structure, flawed management incentives, and a shortage of state-of-the-art specialized
bankingskills.

2.       Under the comprehensive "Financial Reform Program" recently approved by the
Egyptian govemtnent - which addresses, inter-alia, the problems of state-owned banks - the
Central Bank o f Egypt is managing the banking reform program on behalf o f the government
(owner o f the public banks) and to this effect is acting through the "Banking Reform Unit"
establishedat the Centralbank. Inthis context, the owner has directedthe boardo fdirectors, and
the chairman of the board, to develop and implement an institutional and operational
strengtheningprogram for the state-ownedcommercialbank(the Bank)incoordination with the
Banking Reform Unit. Any potential financial restructuring of the Bank will be made
conditional on a convincing and detailed institutional and operational strengthening plan
which would provide comfort to the Egyptian authorities - owner and regulator - and the
market that the restructured institution would be able subsequentlyto operate and grow on a
commercially sustainedbasis inincreasingly open andcompetitive markets.

3.       The Bank is one of the four state-owned commercial banks. As o fDecember 31,2005,
it had total assets ofLExxx billionequivalent, yyy employeesand zzz branch offices. Its main
credit focus has been lending over short-term periods to Egyptian companies and households,
andhas a solid base of retaildeposits throughits branchnetwork. The developmentof the plan
wouldhaveto start by a thorough assessment o f (i) 3anlc's current status andbusiness data
                                                       the
(size, markets, geographical scope, products and services, organization, and financial
statements); (ii) current strategy; (iii)
                                       progress to date inthe Bank's institutional development;
and(iv) currentandplanneddevelopmentactions.

4.       The development o f the program will be carried out by dedicated staff - including
external expertise involving as required a specialized firm or banking institution with sub-
contract arrangements as the need may be     -  with appropriate professional qualifications and
experience (numbers, skills) in assignments concerning banking institutions o f comparable
nature, size, and complexity. The program of operational and institutional strengthening i s

                                               -50-


conducted and coordinated by the Bank's management working closely with the Board in
coordination with the Banking Reform Unit acting on the owner's behalf. The following
sections outline an all exhaustive suggested framework which would be tailored to the specific
situation, needs andpriorities ofeachbank.

                               I1 GeneralScopeoftheProgram
                                 -
5.      The objective of this note is to define the overall frame for the program o f operational
andinstitutional strengtheningwhichwill enablethe Bankto h c t i o nsuccessllly as amodem,
competitive commercial bank. The sequencing of the work should start to generate usable
resultsinthe most critical areas within a few months. Inplanningand conducting its work, due
account should be taken o f the effectiveness and reliability of the Bank`s accounting, financial,
administrative and control procedures. The board and management of the Bank has already
launchedthe operational strengtheningprogram-under mandate from the owner and guidance
from the BankingReformUnitwhich hasprovidedBank's managementwith specific guidelines
to this effect. The BankingReform Unithad also commissioned a comprehensiveindependent
audit and diagnostic study - currently underway andnearing completion -to assess the Bank's
performance, outline the mainareas ofinstitutional weaknesses andpresent recommendationsto
addressthe weaknesses detected.

6.      More specifically, the objective oftheprogramisto supportthe Bank'sboardofdirectors
andmanagementteam efforts indeveloping a detailed, credible business strategy andplan, and
to recommend, inter-alia, steps that should be taken to streamline operations, optimize the
branchand distribution network, and strengthen organizational, operational and management
structures. The plan proposed under the program should include a candid and detailed
assessment of needed professional skills in critical business areas (front, middle and back
office), as well as staffing and staff training. The (revised) strategy o fthe Bank would need to
be strictly definedunder its proposedbusinessplanto preclude lax lendingpolicies andensure
a level playing field for all banks with private as well as public ownership. The proposed
scope of work under the program should cover - as detailed in the following sections        -  the
specific areas of: (i)strategic and business planning; (ii) organization structure; (iii)
                                                                                       budgeting
andperformancemeasurement; (iv) managementinformationsystem andmanagementaccounts;
(v) operations; (vi) automationandtechnology support; (vii) internal audit; (viii) credit analysis
and portfolio management; (ix) asset and liability management; (x) market development and
marketing; and(xi) humanresourcemanagementandtraining.

        A StrategicandBusinessPlanning
           -

7.      While the Bank has developed a planningprocess, it needs to strengthen its formalized
strategic planning capability. Given the need to build and develop the Bank in a changing
economic and market environment, the completion o f a'comprehensive strategic plan is a
priority as it is the necessary foundation for building a program o f institutional change. The
Bank's mandate from the owner would provide the basis for formulating the strategy. The
strategic plan needs, moreover, to be extended into a series o f business plans for various
functions and organizational levels. The strategic planmust clearly define the Bank's mission

                                             - 51 -


andobjectives, target markets, products andservices, financial goals, resourcerequirements and
action plans for executing its strategy andachievingits goals andobjectives,

8.     One of the program's outcomes will be to support the board of directors and
management design and implement a formalized strategic planning process for the Bank as a
whole and the individual business and staff units. That process must establish how the task of
planning is organized, conducted and`monitored on an on-going basis, The role o f various
departments (including, if necessary a specialist strategic planning unit within the Bank) in the
planningexercise must beestablished andthe steps inthe process with appropriate deadlines for
completion oftasks must be outlined andagreed with the Bank's management.

9.     The preparation of the strategic plan will be based inter-alia on the analysis of the
external environment, the competition, current and potential markets, and the Bank`scurrent
market position. To this end, there would be a need to conduct relevant internal analyses to
identify the Bank's strengths and weaknesses in relation to the market, the competition and
future business opportunities. These internal analyses should include profitability analyses of
existing businesses such as corporate and consumer lending. It is expected under the program,
that the Bank's board of directors and senior management would then address and define the
Bank'smission andstrategy, andpreparebusinessandactionplansto executethat strategy. This
corporate strategy will thenbe extended into a series ofplans, each covering a major business of
the Bank.- defining specific goals, target markets, products andservices, resource requirements,
andactions programs as neededto providepractical guidance to eachbusinessunit andtools for
monitoringandevaluatingperformance.

10.     Inthe frame ofthe program, itwouldbe expectedto train Bankstaffinstrategic and
business planning in the course o f the work, so that the Bank has the ability to continue the
planningprocess inthe future, Any identified gaps incritical skills within the Bank should be
reported to management.

        B OrganizationStructure
          -

11,     The Bankwill assess the existing organization structure andits adequacyfor its newrole
andthe requirements ofthe strategy andbusinessplan.Thus, once the strategy andbusiness plan
are developed, the Bankmust review its organizational setting so that it may execute its strategy
successfully. In this regard, the Bank's Board and management will work together to develop
anddocument the organization structure o fthe head-office, regional offices (as the casemaybe),
and their specific relationships to the branch offices and other distribution platforms (e.g. E-
banlung). This would entail a definition of each organizational unit (including permanent
committees), its mission, main responsibilities, key fbnctions to cany out each responsibility,
and required staffing levels.

 12.    To buildthe new organization structure, the Bank's boardand management will define
the specific requirements and will be expected to prepare a plan for implementing the new
organization indicating implementation actions and responsibilities, schedule and support
requirements.

        C BudgetingandPerformanceMeasurement
          -

13.     There will be aneedto assessthe Bank's existingcapitalplanning(interms of economic
rather than regulatory capital) and budgeting systems, and identify any needed improvements.
The objective will be to ensure that the capital planning and budgeting systems are sufficiently
comprehensiveto meet hlly the needs ofthe Bank, including as abasis for providing incentives
for, and controlling, management and staff performancethroughout the institution. Should the
needto upgradethe capital planningandbudgetingsystems be confirmed, the Bankwould need
a revised systemwhich shouldbe formally linkedto the strategicplanningprocessto ensure that
the annual financial planfor the Banktrulyrepresentsandreflects the strategic objectives.

14.     The system, which should be comprehensive and formalized, should ensure that
individual branches and units within the Bank prepare budgets for all income and expenditure
items over which they have responsibility. The process should ensure in particular that: (i)
annual budgets for the Bank and its departments and branches are linked to the strategic
planning process and objectives; (ii) targets are agreed to between head-office and
                                        budget
individual department andbranchmanagersto ensure challenging butrealistic targets andsecure
good motivation and performance fkom managers; (iii)      detailed and relevant variance analyses
take place on a regular basis and all significant variances fiom the Bank'stargets andobjectives
are highlighted and explained as necessary and corrective actions are initiated; and (iv) the
management accounts for the Bank and its constituent parts are designed to report actual
performance againstbudgetsandstrategic targets.

15.     Inadditionto varianceanalysis, the Bankwillensurethat ithasacomprehensivesystem
o f measuring performance against targets through the use of a well defined set o f management
accounts and reports and through a system of individualperformance management. The Bank
will trainacore staffinthe utilizationo fthe new systems andprocesses that maybe developed.

        D ManagementInformationSystemandManagementAccounts
          -

16.     There will be a needto define the information requiredto managethe Bank,measure its
performance andcontrol its risks. On.completion o fthe Bank'sstrategic plan, a detailed planof
the management information required to execute the strategy will need to be completed,
includingmanagement reports at each managerial level. This will cover the accounting system
neededto provide management with financial information for each of the operational units and
product lines, as well as for the Bank as a whole. The new management information
requirements mustbeintegratedinto the automation strategy ofthe Bank.

 17.    In assessing the adequacy of the existing management information system and
recommending adjustments as needed, the Bank will ensure that the management information
planwould cover allthe keyareas ofBankoperations andmanagement,including: (i) and      credit
portfolio status; (ii)treasury including liquidity, interest rate and foreign exchange risks,
fimding, asset and liability management, and deposits management; (iii)operations (front,
middleandback-office), head-office andbranches; and(iv) strategy, budgetingandperformance

                                              - 53 -


measurement including the design and implementation o f an appropriate management
accountingsystem.

18.      To this effect, measures will be needed to ensure that a comprehensive accounting
system for the Bankwill give managementfinancial information on eachof the operationalunits
andfor the Bankas awhole. The accountingsystem shouldinclude information onaprofit and
cost-center basis with appropriate transfer pricing for inter-unit transactions. The management
accounts should also be designedto give revenue, cost andprofitability information byproduct,
customer, branchandbusinessline.

19.      The Bank's management will ensure that the new management infbrmation
requirements, including the management accounts, are integrated into the automation strategy
andtechnology support framework ofthe Bank.The Bankwill also needto train a core staff in
the utilizationofthe new systems andprocessesthat maybedeveloped.

         E Operations
          -

20.      Inlightofthestrategicplan-whichwouldhaveaddressedthesystemsrequirementsfor
new business units - the adequacy of the Bank's operating systems and procedures will be
assessed, together with the need for their strengtheningto ensure their effectiveness. There will
be a need to ensure that any strengthened or revamped systems would take into account the
Bank's plannedbusinesses, methods of operations, service and control requirements and the
automation strategy.

21.      New operations systems and procedures would need to cover both head-office and
branch operations and other productlservice production and distribution networkdsystems.
Indeed,with intensified competition for productsandservices, andpressureonmargins,itwould
be necessary to strengthen operations at the branch level. To this effect, there may be a needto
develop andimplementa "modell' branch, andtest its practicality, (There mightbe aneedalso to
contemplate non-branch production and distribution). The Bank would then plan the model
implementation inthe rest of the branch systemincludingallowance for necessaryvariations to
account for differences inbranches in such aspects as size, level o f automation, and product,
service, or customermix. The developmentofthe modelbranchwould include the: definition of
the mission and role of the branch (integrated with the strategic plan and the overall
organizational plan); design o f operational processes, procedures and workflows; design o f the
organizational structure; and design o f the branch operational infi-astructure. The Bankwill also
traintherelevant teaminthe skills necessaryto assureeffectiveplanimplementation,

         F AutomationandTechnology Support
          -

22.      There will be a need to assess whether the Bank's existing automation and technology
support infrastructure is adequate for the operations, management and control o f an efficient
commercial bank, especially the core system that assists in the administration o f most o f the
central bctions. To this effect, the Bank'smanagement(and external auditors as the case may
be) will review the progressmadewith regardto automation andtechnology andensure that the

                                               - 54 -


Bank has a detailed automation strategy. Once the management information needs have been
defined, the efficiency and effectivenessofthe hardware architectureand system engineering in
the Bank will be reviewedand evaluated (taking into account any contingencyplans relating to
business continuity risks). In so doing, due account will be taken of the need for congruence
between the Bank's strategy, business goals, and existing technology. The work would require
more specifically: (i) assessment o f the information and processing requirements, and a

        G InternalAudit
          -

23.     The Bank's internal audit function will be assessed as well as the needfor strengthening
the related policies, procedures and standards to deal with the Bank's prospective strategy and
revised business model. In line with the strategic plan and the implications o f that plan - in
terms o f organization structure, financial instruments, operations, systems and procedures, and
automation -there will be a needto proposeadjustments as requiredto the internal audit system
andprocesswith appropriatecorrespondingmanuals.

24.     There will be specifically a needto: (i) on improvements to audit methodologies,
                                                 advise
and adequacy of audit coverageinterms of scope (e.g. credit, operations, assets and liabilities
management), depth and reporting standards; (ii)      suggest required follow-up and monitoring;
(iii) theauditorganization;and(iv)identifycomplementaryauditskillrequirements,The
    define
Bank auditing staff will need to be trained inthe utilizationofnew methodologies. (This sub-
component -which requires specializedskills -- would call for interactionwithhnvolvement o f
the external auditors.)

        H CreditAnalysisandPortfolioManagement
           -
25.     Long standing problems of portfolio quality have taken a heavy toll on the Bank's
operations and financial position. A formalized and thorough management and operational
structure delineating credit policies, procedures and systems must be developed as a matter o f
priority. Special emphasis should be given to portfolio control andproblem loan management.
The revised structure should bring up-to-date market skills and techniques to the process o f
credit management, especially inthe context o f the asset quality problems faced by the Bank.
The Bank's management will need to enhance credit management policies, procedures and
systems, regardingboth aspects of credit analysis and portfolio management, and problem loan
management.

27.   (b) - Problem loan management. There would be aneed to optimize policies, procedures
and organizational arrangements [including ifwarranted, specialworkout unit for certain types
of problem assets) related to: (i)  problem loan definition and identification; (ii) loan
                                                                                        problem

28.     There will be a need to train a core staff inthe utilization of each o f the new processes
that maybedeveloped.

        I AssetandLiabilityManagement
         -
29.     The needfor up-to-date treasury and asset and liability management(ALMJpolicies and
practicesis being accentuatedbythe on-going liberalization o fthe financial markets. The skills,
policies and systems required to manage these risks must be strengthened inthe Bank, so that
comprehensive risk management policies be developed or improved to govern interest rate,
liquidity, foreign exchange andother non-credit relatedrisks. Inthis regard, consultantswill be
expected to advise on, and as needed, help implement the processes, organization, and
information systems requiredto manage the range o f ALM risks currently facing the Bank and
any additional risks inherent inthe execution of the Bank strategic plan. The consultants will
assist in developing and documenting processes to cover, at a minimum, such ALM areas as
liquidity, interest rate and duration gap and pricing, and foreign exchange. Further, the
consultants will advise on an organization structure that will execute the proposed, upgraded
ALM processes - defining specific responsibilities, authorities, and functions of each unit, as
well as required staffrng skills.    Inaddition, it will be necessaryto define the information
required to support the ALM processes (e.g., external and internal information, formats and
time-frames). The consultants will assist also as needed inthe implementation and the start-up
ofthe upgradedALMunit.

30.     The consultants will train key staff (treasury staff and management, and other senior
managers who will participate in, or contribute to, ALM decisions) inutilizingthe ALM system
andimplementthe practicalday-to-dayfunctions.

31.     Therewillbe a needto assess the adequacy o fthe Bank's formal marketing function and

                                              -56-


strategy andthe degree to which these are aligned to its activities andto the requirements of the
market, This wouldinclude anassessment ofstaffmarketingandsales experience. Inthis regard
recommendations, as needed, regarding adjustments to the marketing fbnction and strategy
would need to be developed as part of the Bank's strategic andbusiness plan. Inthis context, a
market analysis might be critical to the success of the strategic plan and vital for the proper
execution ofthe business plan.

32.     Inconjunction andcongruentwiththe strategicplan, theBank'smanagementwouldneed
to complete a detailed marketingplanfor the Bank andeach o fits business units covering, as the
case may be, new product introductions, service innovations and improvements. These plans
should include: (i)definition of market objectives; (ii) analysis of market targets, products,
                    a                                      an
and growth rates and shares; (iii) analysis of customer needs, and marketing image of the
                                    an
Bank and its services; (iv) a marketing "strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats"
analysis for the Bank; and (v) a plan of organization of marketing and sales at head-office and
branch levels.

33.     Inparticular, t consultants, as needed, should advise the Bank's management on how
business units should best be defined to meet the requirements of customers and the
achievement o f the Bank's strategic goals. (For instance, the assessment could be made as to
whether there is a need for relationship or account managers to handle major clients, the
different organizational arrangements required for retail, small corporate, private sector clients or
the possible requirement to set up specialist units for individualproduct areas.) The Bank'snon-
marketing functions and operations should be examined also for impact onthe Banksmarketing
goals. The results of the analysis should be considered inthe Bank'soverall review of strategy
andoperations.

34.      The consultants will advise on skills needed for market analysis and planning, and help
institute a formalized market planning and development process within the framework of the
Bank'sstrategicplanningprocess. The consultants willbeexpected also to helpthe management
of the Bank define: (i)t r W gprogramregarding the Bank'smarketing strategy andmethods
                        a

         K HumanResourceManagementandTraining
           -

35.      There will be a need to assess the Bank's human resource management practices and
their adequacy for a commercial bank operating in an increasingly competitive environment.
Following the assessment o f the adequacy in terms of staff skills, recommendations may be
needed to address identified deficiencies in light of the Bank's revised business strategy and
business focus and plans. To this end, a comprehensive training needs analysis will be required
and a formalized training (and as neededrecruitment) plan, inline with the requirements ofthe
Bank'sstrategic plan, shouldbe established. The analysis andplanshould take into account the
requirements under each o fthe Bank's functional areas.

36.      The Bank's human resource management systems will have to be thoroughly assessed,
and as need be, upgraded to meet both current and future humanresource requirements. There

                                                - 57 -


will be a need to address: (i) the Bank's immediate needs for buildingcritical skills and
                                first
efficiently deploying the work force to staff its new organization, and support the execution of
its strategy and business plan; then (ii) Bank's medium-term needs for developing and
                                              the
managingits humanresources.

37.     The Bank will need         to implement a first set of high-priority human resource
management systems consisting specifically of: (i)    a training needs analysis; (ii)training and
                                                                                    a
development master plan, including a prioritization and planningof how all training needs will
be met, and the launching o f highest priority programs; (iii)performance appraisal system,
                                                                 a
including the assessment of the performance andpotential of employees, and the identification
of major developmentneeds; and(iv) a staffing programwhich entailsthe effective matchingof
people tojobs inthe revisedorganization structure.

38.     The Bank's next order of priority is to build, implement and train staff in applying the
humanresource management systems, related to: (i)       manpower planning, covering supply and
demandanalysis, projection of manpower gaps and excesses (over 2 to 4 years) by major skill
andrank level, andplansto fill the gaps and deal with the excesses; (ii)    recruitment, with pro-
active methods for fmding and selecting key talents; (iii)        rewards management, along a
compensation scheme that will attract, retain and motivate managers, technical personnel and
stafc (iv) management development, with methods for developing general and technical
managers; (v) performance management, through an effective system for managing individual
performance (e.g., goals, standards, monitoring, evaluation); and(vi) work culture development,
under a program for building a competitive, commercial work culture throughout the
organization.

39.      These steps will include documentation o f each system in the form o f an operating
manual, as well as pilot implementation and training o f implementation staff. In particular,
consultants, as needed, will conduct on-the-job training for the staff so that the Bankhasthe full
ability to carry on the work inthe future. The consultants may set as a priority - although this
would have to be basedon the training needs analysis - the focus on two selected and critical
groups o f managers: (i)   branch managers, where training should cover inter-alia, business
planning, profit and cost management, humanresource management, management control and
marketing; and (ii)   head-office department directors, where training should cover inter-alia,
business and staffing planning, profit and cost management, human resource management,
changemanagement, performancemonitoringandmeasurement.

                                BankingRegulationandSupervision

1.      The build-up of a strong and credible regulatory and supervisory framework is an
essential anchor o f the overall financial reform program. The CBE has embarked on a
comprehensive program o f capacity building inbanking regulation and supervision covering
extended areas of the regulatory and supervisory fknctions. The Eur~system'~                    has been
providing assistanceto the CBE inthis regards under EUfunding since December 1,2005. A
senior resident advisor hasjoined the Banking Supervision Department o fthe Central Bank o f
Egyptfor two years alongwith apart-time project coordinator.

2.      Under the European program, an assessment of bankingsupervision at the CBE was
carried out. The first mission (with 9 staff members from various European national Central
banks) took place duringDecember 11-15,2005 andfocused on supervisory issues relating to
off-site supervision, organizational issues, licensing, and specific banking risks ( market,
interest rate, liquidity and systemic risks). The second mission (with 12 staff members from
the Eurosystem) from January 15-19,2006 focused on on-site supervision, credit risk analysis
including the use o f the credit register, informationtechnology issues andtraining curriculum.
A report based on a needs assessment outlined a program of capacity building which was
approved byCBE DeputyGovernor at endMarch2006.

3.      The assessment has identifiedthree major gaps impedingbankingsupervision:

        (i) - Thefirst gav relates to some drawbacks in thepresent organization chart of the
Banking Supervision Department, notably lack o f information sharing, with no clear
allocation of duties, and no accountability. To this effect, the report makes proposals for an
overhaul ofthe BankingSupervision department

        (ii) - The second zav relates to the insujicient capacity within the Banking
Supe~isionDepartment to support the shift to a risk-based supervision. The report
recommends creating five project teams (off-site supervision, inspections, legal issues and
regulation, macro-prudential analysis and training) in addition to a working group on IT
systems and support. The objective is to foster ownership within the Banking Supervision
Departmentandmove away from delivery of"ready made solutions".

        (iii) - The third gav relates to the lack of applied internal guidelines that would
support a unifbrm implementation of a risk-based supervision approach. To this end, the five
project teams and the working group on IT must draft new internal guidelines in line with a
risk-focusedbanking supervision.

4.      In addition to the Europeanprogram, the Financial Services Volunteer Corps of the
USAhas delivereda technical assistanceprogram through short-term expert missions andhas

recently submitted recommendationsinterms o fmanagementinformation systems (MIS) and
ITneeds for supporting banking supervision at the CBE

5.       The World Bank, based on the Eurosystem assessment, ranked the main priorities
along a two-phase action plan through 2008, and which is outlined inthe following sections.
The World Bank team views the build-up of a robust credit risk management system is a
critical bankingsystemissue which should be addressedon apriority basis.

                                       I FIRSTPHASE
                                        -

6.       The first phase o f the program would set up the underpinnings o f a strengthened
regulatory and supervisory framework. As a first priority the CBE would conduct a
comprehensive review o f the on-site and off-site processes, and cany out an organizational
restructuring o f the bankingsupervision fbnction. As a second priority, in line with the new
regulation underway, banks, especially public sector banks, wouldhave to improve their credit
risk policies and develop systems for extending credit, reviewing and classif$ng loans, and
defining realistic provisioning needs. The third priority for banking supervision would be to
implement anadequate, proactive framework to deal with problembanks.

         A FirstPriority
           -

7.       As a first priority, the CBE would conduct a comprehensive review of the on-site and
off-site processes, and carry out an organizational restructuring of the banking supervision
function. The Eurosystem's report recommendscreating new capacities insuch areas as macro
prudential monitoring, legal andregulation oversight, and IT support and methodology, while
removing responsibilities in others such as FX control, customer complaints activities and
Court expert assignments. The World Bank's view is that the proposed new activities could
strengthen the off-site supervision which is today largely compliance-based, and foster a more
proactive and modem supervision approach. In addition, the removal of non core activities
(namely, FX control, customer complaints activities and court expert assignments) will
refocus the bankingsupervision department on its key objectives.

8.       (a)- On-site and off-site supervision process and organizational restructuring.
The bankingcontrol department has currently 342 people (557 when includingcredit registry
and FX activities) overseeing 43 banks. Central Bank of Egypt's recruitment efforts since
2002 has resulted ina strengtheningand rejuvenation of the work force where new graduates
account for about 18% o f the total. Notwithstandingtheir good education background, these
newcomers need training and incentives, while a new culture based on efficiency and
achievements needs to be built. To this effect, the entire banking supervision training policy
and process would be evaluated to assess if the training programs are congruent with and
responsive to the needs o f the banking supervision. Training would also be useful for
management to enhance leadership capacity. The Eurosystem has already engaged a dialogue
with the EgyptianBankingInstitute to elaborate a draft curriculum andwith aview o f sharing
its experience.

                                               -61 -


9.      (b)- On site supervision.Increasedattention shouldbedirectedto credit organization
andpolicy, concentration of credit, sourceof finding, risk management system, IT systemand
internal controls. The Eurosystem program recommends that on site process be upgraded to
meet the risk-based supervision requirements: (i) the mission in sharing information
                                                      before
with off-site supervision and the macro-surveillance unit; during the mission in staffing the
team with relevant people (especially regarding IT or market risks); and (ii) the mission
                                                                               after
in setting up a collegial body for reviewing the inspection findings, and dealing in full
transparencywith inspection follow-up and enforcement.

10.     (c) - Off site supervision. A new IT system would need to be implemented on a
timely basis to increase efficiency and productivity. As far as validation of supervisory
information is concerned, the Eurosystem's report recommendsthat a dedicated Methodology
and IT Working Group (MIT-WG) be in charge of designing and building the supervisory
information flow. More specifically, the MIT-WG would analyze the IT supervisory needs
(hardware, software, protocol for data collection and data administration, etc.. .) including the
possibility to store all official banking financial statements. Inaddition, both on site, and off
site supervision must work together to create a continuous, seamless supervisory cycle.
Besides, CBE would need to take measures to ensure the sharing o f informationbetween the
off site supervision and the credit registry department to improve the knowledge o f the credit
portfolio o f each bank. In addition, due consideration should be given to a possible merger
between licensing and off site units to strengthen the monitoring o f individual institutions.
The off site supervision must develop new tools to focus on critical issues for an enhanced
decision making process (peer comparison analysis, Early Warning System etc.. .). To this
purpose, the IT working group to be set per the Eurosystem recommendation has to redesign
the framework o fthe supervisory informationflow andbuildanew MIS.

11.     The new organizational structure could be built on three pillars: (i) surveillance
                                                                              macro
(including CCR) department; (ii)    off-site department, including licensing and legal affairs; and
(iii) department.
     on-site

        B Second Priority
           -

12.     In line with the new regulation underway, banks, especially public sector banks16,
would have to improve their credit risk policies and develop systems for extending credit,
reviewing and classifying loans, and defining realistic provisioning needs. Regarding
connected and directed lending, measures should be taken to ensure that banks have inplace
an independentdecision makingprocess that would preclude conflicts o f interest and enforce
arms lengthlendingpolicies.




l6 A European program is currently underway to support NBE and Bank Misr in redesigning and
implementinganewriskmanagementprocess.

                                                - 62 -


The mainissues are reviewedthereafter.

13.     (a) Credit policy.The CBE has to vet fully the implementation bythe banks o f their
             -
credit policies. These credit policieshave to be comprehensive, prudent, and consistent with a
sound management of bank's activity. Furthermore, it is crucial to assess the skills and
knowledge of the staff incharge of credit approval, and check ifbanks have adequate systems
to control andmonitor the implementation o f suchpolicies.

14.      (b) Loan evaluation and loan loss provisioning.The new system will improvethe
             -
accurate knowledge of the bank loan portfolio.            For the implementation o f the new
classification o f loans, training sessions are needed for credit officers andbankingsupervision
examiners. This implies also that banks have in place a credit organization and credit
management systems in compliance with the new regulation (in particular, a good credit
administration)). As a result, banks have to improve their systems for granting credit, for
reviewing and classifjmg loans, and for determining realistic provisions. More specific
measures should be taken to tackle problem loans (restructured loans, in particular) as the
regulation inthis regards currently lacks clarity. The main outstanding issuesrelate to how to
get fiom   companies accurate, andup-to-date financial statements with all neededinformation.
In addition, with a new tax law being introduced, consideration should be given to the tax
deductibilityo f specific loan lossprovisions so as to induce banksto recognize voluntarily the
true value of their nonperforming loans, and increase their willingness to resolve them more
aggressively.

15.      (c) - Large  exposure.It is necessaryto provide bankswith an extensive definition of
close related parties. Banks must in a comprehensive way identify and monitor credit
exposuresto closely relatedgroups onthe basis of such specific guidelines.

16.      (d) Connected and directedlending.Proceduresmust be set up to prevent persons
             -
benefiting fiom a loan from participating inthe preparation o f the loan assessment or in the
related decision-making process. These loans have to be approved by the Board o f directors.
Banks have to develop risk management rules, procedures and information systems for
lending to connected parties in order to avoid conflicts of interest. The new draft regulation
should also address directed lending with regards to state-owned banks in particular. In
addition, specific guidelines should be issued to improve corporate governance in public
banks and ensure that loans are made on the basis o f borrower creditworthiness and debt
service capacity

         C Third Priority
            -

17.      The third priority for banking supervision would be to implement an adequate,
proactive framework to deal with problem banks. Thus, as regards capital adequacy and
remedial measures, the CBE would need to develop a risk-based approach to determine the
levels of capital ratios. To this effect, a broad range o f analyses may need to be developed to
assess whether the banks have sufficient capital to sustain losses. CBE should develop internal
guidelines for crisis management for dealing with problem banks, such as taking control o f a

bank indistress, imposing a moratorium, restructuring the bank's liabilities, transferring all or
part o f its businessto another bank or to a specialpurpose entity, andproviding lender of last
resort facilities. For this purpose, the off site supervision has to develop and implement an
early warning system with stress testing analysis. More broadly, the project group on off-site
supervision recommendedbythe Eurosystemhasto formalize a new framework for corrective
actions and enforcement. The experience o f the Banking Reform Unit (BRU) should be
sharedwith the bankingsupervision staffas cross fertilization.

                                        -

18.      Under the second phase of the program, efforts should be directed to implement as a
first priority, a new framework for strengthening internal control and audit in banks. The
secondpriority should address operational risk andrelatedissues, andthe thirdpriority should
take steps to controlmarketrisks.

         A FirstPriority
            -

19.      The first priority would relate to internal control and audit. Indeed, CBE cannot rely
only on the external auditors as their quality is uneven, with some smaller firms having lower
professional standards than the major international ones (KPMG has a dominant position in
the market). CBE would need to enhancethe quality o f internal control and audit inbanks and
ensure bank's top and middle management commitment to the process. CBE would need to
support through specific guidelines what is an accurate and comprehensive internal control
system basedon risk management. Consolidated supervision would also need to be enhanced
and brought in line with international standards. The Eurosystem recommends setting up a
legal and regulation unit with particular skills in the legal and accounting fields. This unit
could start working on internal controls inbanks and consolidated supervision.

         B SecondPriority
            -
20.      The second priority for the CBE i s to address operational risk and related issues.
Currently, there are no guidelines from CBE to ensure that bankshave inplace procedures and
systems for identifying, managing and monitoring this risk. In this regard, the CBE has to
develop specialized IT examinations focusing on areas such as information system
management, computer operations, computer security, system development and networking,
for fighting against fraud and keeping safe the business activity. The Eurosystem action plan
recommends that existing policies andpractices for inspection beupdated to become fonvard-
looking and risk-based with a focus on new issues such as operational risk and internal
controls. The I T working group has to develop a methodology for such assistance.

         C Third Priority
            -

21.      The third priority, in line with the development o f financial markets, would call for
takingsteps to control market risk. There are still no limits to equities trading and investment,
andno guidelines for banksto deal with these risks, notably instress testing. Capitaladequacy

ratio does not take into account market risks. Regardingthe foreign exchangerisk, CBEhasto
ensure that banks have inplace adequate information systems to identify accurately this risk.
Inthe context o f the Egyptianbankingsector, interest rate risk is not a crucial issue at this
stage becausethere are no important mismatchesbetween assets andliabilities on averageand
no major re-pricing issues. This analysis will be part o f the responsibilities o f the new macro
financial unit recommended by the Eurosystem, and which would tackle these issues in line
with international experiences. In coordination with the legal and regulation unit, it has to
propose regulation amendmentsor newrules when appropriate.

                                            ANNEX IV:
     Terms of Reference for Restructuring and Privatization of State-owned Insurers



This Terms of Reference supports the Request for Proposal for this project that appearedin
the Economist datedxxxx.

The Government ofthe Republic ofEgypt (GOE) is carrying out abroadprogram of financial
sector reform which includes a substantive insurance component. The broad project
components as they refer to insuranceinclude:

         1. Restructuring and privatization of some or all of the state-owned insurers (SOIs),
            including establishing a holdingcompany.

        2. Reformingthe insuranceregulatory/ supervisory regime,

        3, Reforming the Motor Third Party Liability (`ACT') insurance system, reducing
            premiumtaxes and opening the marketto local andinternational brokers.

        4. Strengthening insurance sector institutions, including training and the actuarial
            profession.

The responsible Ministry, the Ministry o f Investment (MOI) has sought the services o f a
Consultant to assist with the first of these insurance sector liberalization pillars.         This
involves: `the restructuring (including without limitations the financial and corporate
restructuring) and privatization o f the state-owned insurers, involving the privatization or
opening o f the share capital o f all or part o f any o fthe state-ownedinsurers, bymeans of sale,
transfer, contribution o f the shares or assets o f the relevant target to private investors. The
Project may include investment commitments, transfer o f equity stakes (meaning all or part)
o f the share capital or transfer of assets o f any or all o fthe state-ownedinsurers, through sale,
disposal, contribution in kind, capital increase, initial public offering o f whole or part o f the
share capital o f any o f the state-ownedinsurers or any other means or form of transfer, or any
combination or variation thereof (any such agreement will be herein referred to as a
"Contemplated Transaction", all o f them being collectively referred to as the "Contemplated
Transactions")'.

The Consultants' services under the contract comprise two phases namely the (i)         Preparation
and Restructuring Phase (Phase I) and (ii)      the PrivatizationPhase (Phase 11). The Consultant
consists o f a consortium of professional and advisory firms. The other party to the contract
consists o f a consortium o f the four state-owned insurers (SOIs) during Phase 1, with a
Steering Committee havingcoordination and decision making authority.

BACKGROUND

The government of Egypt is engaged in financial sector reform, supported inter-alia by the
International Bank for ReconstructionandDevelopment (IBRD) through development lending
and trust funded technical assistance. The overarching objective o f the program i s to support
efforts by GOE to improve financial sector efficiency. An important element inthis process is
ensuring that the four dominant state-owned insurers (Misr, El Chark, National, Egypt Re,)
contribute to a more competitive and efficient insurance marketplace. The full liberalization
program also includes insurance regulatory reform, strengthening supervision, strengthening
the sector's institutions andprivate pensions andMTPLreform.

The SOIs continue to dominate the major lines ofnonlife insurance, includingall commercial
transport lines (MAT), much of which i s government controlled, and comprehensive motor
and compulsory motor third partly liability insurance (MTPL or `ACT' Insurance). These
accounted for 62% o f gross premiums in20031'4, with the largest single class being aviation.
Aviation and marine hull are heavily reinsured and the local front insurers (the SOIs) are
remunerated through exchange commission. Both classes have had a poor underwriting
experience in recent years. Aviation i s the largest single account and to date has made a
significant contribution to Misr's gross revenues and profit margins. Misr i s the largest
insurer andhas a strongpublishedbalance sheet andreportedprofit history. Howeverits other
commercial and industrial portfolios, much o f which comes from SOEs, show a similar
patternto aviation andare also heavilyreinsured. Thisprobably implies that underwritingand
risk management skills within the SOIs have not been developed to a level where they could
retain significantly more of the risks on their books, and points to the desirability o f
introducing strategic partners, new managementwith international skills or portfolio transfer
to other insurers.

Motor insurance is largely retained locally and while the voluntary comprehensive coverage
has produced break even results (only 5% of car owners buy comprehensive cover, probably a
select portfolio) MTPL appears to bea chronic loss maker for the state-ownedinsurers. While
gross loss ratios for this class are possibly understated given poor run off data and non
application o fmodern actuarial techniques, they have still trebled to 292% inthe four years to
200314:claims have no theoretical upper limit inthe courts andpremiums are currently set on
the basis of assumed affordability by a non financial ministry. Amending legislation is in
train but this does not appear to address all MTPL issues and a mediumterm strategy to put
this class o f business onto a financially sustainable basis will need to be produced and
adopted.

Anecdotal evidence points to excess competition beginning to develop inproperty insurance
markets with subsequent pressure on treaty reinsurers to accept attendant facultative
placements (often without a lead). There is also evidence that treaty arrangements may have
been abused. Such activities, ifthey become pervasive will harmthe reputation of the industry
and could adversely affect hture reinsurance terms. On the other hand there appears to be

                                              - 67 -


limited competition for the very large industrial accounts such as Egypt Air, which would
benefit from professional risk managementadvice from international intermediaries. Brokers
are not allowed to operate inEgypt as corporate entities. The one representative office that is
present services the local operations o finternational accounts.

On the life insurance side there is evidence o f unhealthy levels of competition between the
state-owned players. The standardproducts being sold involve guaranteed returns, mainly in
EL and US$, but with some demand also emerging for Euro denominated contracts.
Guaranteedreturns inELhave increasedfrom 6.5% to 8.0% under competitive pressure. $US
returns vary from 3% to 5%.    At the upperendthese offer little safetymarginandundermany
jurisdictions would require special additional reservesto be established. The current reserving
methodology for life contracts appears to be unsound (gross premium with no reserve for
future bonuses, although arelatively low discount rateis used).

The recent significant increase inforeign market share inthe life business largely reflects the
banc-assurance strategies o f CIL (Legal and General's joint venture with Commercial
International) andAllianz.

Interms of balance sheet restructuring the state-owned insurers hold property subject to non
commercial leasel rental terms and subject to confiscation issues, and have invested in non
listedenterprises. The direct writers have also beingwritinginwardsreinsurance.

For thepurposesof this TOR the following assumptions should bemade:

              All non `own use' property will be swapped for government paper of suitable
              duration, or cash, on a book value basis unless sale is imminent. The creation
               o f a state-ownedinsurer holdingcompany should facilitate this exercise.

              Direct writers will be forbidden from writing inwards reinsurance as from the
              next financial year. The existingportfolio will be commuted to Egypt Re. as at
              December 31,2006 onmarket terms.

              Holdings in unlisted entities may be retained ifthey are suitable for an insurer,
               are likely to produce a reasonable return and are reasonably liquid (i.e. have
              readybuyers).

              National will not be privatizedpending development and implementation o f the
               larger social insurance strategy (which should include the large schemes
              managed by National). However its commercial non life and life business
              portfolios will be available for transfer/ sale.

               Compulsory motor business will either be put onto a commerciallyviable basis,
              inwhichcasethe insurancesectoras awholewillbeeligible to underwrite it, or
               alternatively a specialist mutual insurer will be established and technical
              provisions will betransferred to it at actuarial valuations.

                                - 6 8 -


Egypt Re. is not to be mergedwith any direct writer. However it may form a
business combination with another reinsurer or reinsurers.

The insurers to be privatized will be exempted from current civil service HR
seniority laws prior to privatization, subject to the finalization o f anHRplan.

Ifaninsurer is to retainbothits life andnonlife businessesthesewill be split
andhandledthrough separately licensedcorporate entities.

Agency licensing, including minimum technical qualifications, will be
introduced and this will lead to some rationalization and upgrading of the local
distributionsystem.

International brokers will be allowed to operate as intermediaries in the local
market within 36 months, but will only be allowed to provide fee bases
technical services to the major 200 SOE accounts.

Any excess capital remaining aAer restructuring will be returned to GOE prior
to privatization.

Major systems or product strategy changes will not be contemplated prior to
privatization. Pricingstrategychanges wouldbe considered.

Where early sale o f anon life businessportfolio i s indicated this will be through
a process o f International Competitive Biddingand the following general terms
andconditions shall apply:

     price shall bethe key determinantfor selection, subject to the bidder having
     demonstrateda capacity to add management, technical and systems value.

     foreign ownership o fup to 100%willbe permitted.

     there will be no obligation to take all related staff subject to a clear HR
     strategyhavingbeendeterminedwith GOE.

     obligations at law andunder contract to affected agents will continue

     government and SOE insurance business will not necessarily renew, but
     existing contractswill be honored.

     in the transaction structure, the current shareholders will be prepared to
     share with a non life portfolio purchaser any gains or losses on future
     claims runoff against technical provisions and the realization of insurance
     receivables under a gainlloss sharing arrangement. An independent
     actuarial firm has been hired by the FA to determine the technical
     provisions, which will be on a discounted basis for long tail claims. An
     accounting firm will assess insurance receivables. These values will form

                    the basis for determining the gaidloss sharing arrangement (after allowing
                    for notional investment income rollup).A non life portfolio purchaser will
                    be responsible for managing the claims run off under regular due diligence,
                    with the objective of minimizing any probabilityo f a deficit arising while
                    settling claims according to the law.

OBJECTIVE

The M O Iwishes to bringabout as expeditiously as possible the restructuring andprivatization
o f Misr, El Chark, National and Egypt Re. New proprietors may be Egyptianor foreign, the
guiding tenets being reputation, management capacity and ability to contribute to the
development o fthe Egyptian financial sector andeconomic growth...

MOI has invited a Financial Consultant (FA) to advise on a Transaction Structure for the
privatization o f three of the four state-owned insurers and the non sensitive portfolios o f the
fourth. The FA will work with MOI and the management teams at Misr, El Chark, National
and Egypt Re. to prepare the institutions1 portfolios for privatization, including supervising
the sellers due diligence; restructuring balance sheets, corporate structures and portfolios as
necessary; making recommendations on management strengthening as requested; preparing
HR plans; recommending the proposed privatization process in each case and effecting any
privatizations agreed upon. The last item will allow for the number and nature o f likely
investors.

SCHEDULE OFASSIGNMENT

M O I wishes to complete the privatization program within twenty four months from the
initiation o fthe contract. Itis assumedthat Phase 1will take between9 and 15 months.

CONSULTANT'S RESPONSIBILITIES

Duringthe performance of its work the FA may be expected to interface with a range of
entities. Aside from M O I and the companies, these are likely to include the Egyptian
Insurance SupervisionAgency (EISA).
The FA'Sresponsibilities shall includeperformingallpreparatorydue diligence, analytical and
restructuring work and reviewing and advising on the privatization approach proposed for
eacho fthe three insurers identified above.

Another key aspect o f the engagement i s the early identification o f potential investors. VThile
price will be important, a capacity to contribute to insurance and institutional investor
development is a precondition.

The scope ofwork andtasks for Phase 1are showninAppendix 1-Scope ofWork.

                                             - 70 -


EXPECTEDOUTPUTS

The outputs for Phase 1are as follows:
  A comprehensive owner's due diligence report of Misr's, ElChark's, National's andEgypt
Re's assets and liabilities and business operations, including contingent liabilities and tax
benefits, if any, likely to accrue to potential purchasers (see Annex 1 for detailed
requirements);

  A detailed plan for optimizing the attractiveness of the various entities for privatization
including financial andoperatingrestructuring;

4 A report onthe three direct insurers' fi-anchiseandbrandvalues;

4 A due diligence report by legal experts on all assets and liabilities to certify that they are
accurate and adequately documented and a review o f all litigation with an opinion on the
probability o fthe insurerbeingsuccessful;

   A draft Information Memoranda (IM) and other information materials for use in the
advertisement, publicity, marketingandsubsequent privatization;

  Long lists o fpotential investors for preliminarypre-qualification;

4 A presentationto the senior officers ofMOIonthe interimandfinal recommendations;

4 An implementationtimetable andproject plan, andidentifiedproject team.

Itis important to ensure that a sufficientlystrongteam is inplace to completethe work within
defined timescales. All reports should be submitted in six copies with an electronic media
copy inMicrosoft Word format.

STAFFINGOFTHE ASSIGNMENT

1.      As part ofthe government"Financial ReformProgram", the Ministry ofInvestmentand
< HZ--Insurer>seeks to engage the services of an international firm (the Consultant) to
conduct a comprehensive independent seller's due diligence of a state-owned insurer (the
Insurer), and as the case may be, its group of subsidiaries and their consolidated position. The
diagnostic studyperformed, andthe opinionsandreportsprovidedwill beinaccordancewiththe
recommendationsof the International Accounting StandardsBoard(IASB) and standards o fthe
Institute o f Actuaries &JK) or Academy of Actuaries, unless otherwise specified inthese terns
o freference.

2.      This engagement should be carried out by staff with appropriate professional
