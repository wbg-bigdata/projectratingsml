Bangladesh                                                                    Page I of 16
A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1)
Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest countries, with a 1996 per capita GNP of $260. Health and
population remain among the country's most urgent development issues, although Bangladesh has made
remarkable progress in some areas. It is the only country among the 20 poorest where sustained fertility
reduction has taken place over the last 15 years: the total fertility rate has declined by more than half
since the 1970s. Child immunization has increased from 10 to 70 percent, and there have been
substantial reductions in infant and child mortality.
At the same time, major challenges remain. The main causes of death remain poverty-related infectious
diseases, which are exacerbated by and contribute to malnutrition. Gender differentials in health persist.
Bangladesh's maternal mortality ratio is one of the highest in the world. About 70 percent of mothers
suffer from iron deficiency anemia, and 75 percent of pregnant women do not receive assistance from a
trained attendant at the time of delivery. Over 90 percent of children have some degree of malnutrition.
Past gains were achieved through costly targeted programs. Separate delivery of health and family
planning services boosted performance at an earlier stage but is neither efficient nor sustainable. In
addition, demands for services are increasing as a result of population growth and the unfinished
population and health agenda: poor maternal and child health and nutrition, unmet need for family
planning, and a potential HIV/AIDS epidemic. For more than two decades the Government has relied on
substantial donor assistance to the sector, but such resources are increasingly limited. The time has come
when Government must focus on cost-effective use of available resources to address the country's health
and population needs and achieve sustainability.
The Government's Health and Population Sector Program supported by the Health and Population
Program Project (HPPP) meets these challenges in three ways: (1) through technical support and funding
to improve coverage and quality of essential health and family planning services for vulnerable groups,
particularly poor women and children; (2) by supporting public sector reorganization and reform efforts
to achieve more cost-effective service delivery, elimination of duplication, improved quality, and better
utilization; and (3) by laying the groundwork for broader health reform, including greater involvement of
NGOs and the private-for-profit sector in service delivery, decentralization, cost recovery and new
approaches to financing. Because these efforts involve changes throughout the public health system,
HPPP will be implemented through a results-oriented, sector-wide program approach.
Through these efforts, the Program is expected to achieve better access to essential services for the poor,
lower maternal mortality andl morbidity, and continued improvements in child health and family planning.
Reorganization and reform of public services are expected to enable the Government to improve the
quality and utilization of its system and to allocate its limited resources more cost-effectively. Efforts to
enhance sector-wide management capacity and carry out reforms including decentralization and
devolution of some hospital services to the private sector are key steps toward institutional capacity
development and broader health reform.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 14998-BD, update: R96-220, IDA/R96-177
Date of latest CAS discussion: 3/31/98
The design of HPPP derives directly from the Bangladesh Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) as well as
from relevant economic and sector work (ESW) including the Bangladesh Health and Population Sector
Strategy (HPSS) of 1997, the World Development Report for 1993 (Investing in Health), and the Health,



Project Appraisal Document                                          Health and Population Program Project
Bangladesh                                                                          Page 2 of 16
Nutrition, and Population Sector Strategy Paper (HNP/SSP- 1997). The Bangladesh CAS highlights
Human Development (HNP and Education) as one of four components of IDA's assistance strategy and
identifies a shift from a projectized to a sector approach as a means for achieving quality and efficiency
improvements. Consistent with this framework and with the sector strategy (HPSS), HPPP was
developed as a Sector Investment Program with a focus on achieving quality and efficiency
improvements in the sector and addressing key sector issues, including malnutrition, by provision of
basic health services. Malnutrition is also addressed by the Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition Project and
a planned National Nutrition Program.
Links with ESW are also direct. HPPP represents a translation of the Health and Population Sector
Strategy (HPSS) into an expenditure and reform plan. HPPP's Essential Services Package is a subset of
the WDR93's minimum package of public health and essential clinical services taking into account
mortality and morbidity patterns in Bangladesh as well as extreme financial constraints. The HNP/SSP
describes the objectives of HNP work at the World Bank as: (i) improvement of the health, nutrition,
and population outcomes of the poor; (ii) enhancement of the performance of health care systems; and
(iii) securing of sustainable health care financing. HPPP is designed to achieve the first two of these
objectives and provides building blocks for the third.
2. Main sector issues and government strategy:
Key sector issues are:
* the persistence of poverty-related infectious diseases exacerbated by and contributing to malnutrition;
* high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity;
* continued unmet need for family planning
Specific program issues include:
*  inefficiency and duplication in service delivery, resulting in particular from the bifurcation between
the Health and Family Planning Directorates;
*  poor quality of care and lack of client-oriented service delivery;
*  underutilization of many public sector health facilities;
•  lack of a referral system;
D  gender bias in the availability, accessibility, delivery and management of services;,
*  inadequate cooperation and coordination between public, private-for-profit, and NGO sectors.
HPSS identifies two major strategies to address these issues. First, priority in the allocation of public-
sector resources is given to an essential services package (ESP) that benefits vulnerable groups,
particularly poor women and children. Second, sectoral reforms to ensure that those services are
sustainable and can be delivered in a cost-effective, client-focused and gender-sensitive manner are
identified; these include reorganization, improved sector management, and decentralization. These
strategies are outlined in the Government's Program Implementation Plan (PIP) and summarized in
Annex 2.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project, strategic choices, and lending instrument:
HPPP is designed as a Sector Investment Program (SIP) that addresses the issues identified in HPSS and
noted above. The choice to continue support of the public sector is based on substantial impact achieved
with previous IDA programs and a recognition that for the foreseeable future the public sector will have
to provide preventive and promotive health. At the same time, partnerships with NGOs will be
strengthened and private provision of curative care will be expanded. The project will support
government efforts to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and management of public programs, and to
set standards and improve the regulatory environment for the private sector. Recognizing that

achievement of sector development objectives will require more than a single five-year investment
operation, the Government of Bangladesh, IDA, and other development partners will, at the mid-term
review, consider modalities for achieving additional flexibility and a longer term commitment.
C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2for a detailed description and Annex 3for detailed costs):
Total program cost over the five-year period is estimated at US$2.9 billion. IDA and other development

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
Policy reform
Prioritization of services. UJnder HPPP priority will be given to client-centered delivery of an essential
services package (ESP) that will benefit vulnerable groups (women, children, the poor). ESP comprises
reproductive and child health care, communicable disease control and limited curative care and will
emphasize problem areas including maternal health, balanced use of family planning methods, and
STD/AIDS. Some 60-65 percent of total public sector resources will be allocated for support of ESP.
Other policy reforms. Establishing a gender strategy; involving stakeholders in the design and
implementation of the program; adopting a Patient Charter of Rights; resource mobilization, including
cost recovery; reviewing the National Drug Policy; involving NGOs and the private sector.
Institutional reform
Restructuring. GOB established a High-Level Committee on Organization and Management (HLCOM)
to recommend how to reorganize and restructure the sector in order to achieve more cost-effective and
client-focused delivery of the ESP. Following HLCOM recommendations: (i) service delivery from the
Thana level down will be integrated under a single line of command, thus eliminating the duplication and
inefficiency arising from the bifurcation of service delivery between the Family Planning and Health
Directorates; and (ii) district and directorate levels will be restructured to support unified service delivery.
Building sector management capacity. Effective management of the sector program requires a shift from
the current projectized approach. Following the recommendations of a management capacity assessment,
the MOHFW Secretariat will be reorganized, management training undertaken and support services
strengthened. A Change Management Unit to assist MOHFW in undertaking the transition to sector-wide
management will be established. Reorganized financial information and management systems will be
introduced in MOHFW in the first phase of the government-wide RIBEC initiative.

Decentralization. To promote decentralization of planning and use of resources as well as responsiveness
to clients, a pilot will be undertaken in one district and its thanas (Six-Thana Decentralization Pilot).
Managerial and financial autonomy will be provided, and a provider-purchaser agreement between
MOHFW and the district based on outputs and outcomes will be negotiated. Expansion of pilot results
would be linked to implementation of the Local Government Initiative proposed by GOB. Additionally,
an Improved Hospital Management Pilot will be implemented in one medical college hospital and one
district hospital to develop autonomous management of hospitals, including cost recovery and provider
incentives, through suitably empowered hospital boards.
3. Benefits and target population:
Social and Economic Benefits.
*  Reduction in infant, child and matemal mortality and morbidity and the infectious disease burden;
*  Improved access to services for impoverished households, especially women and young children;
*  Reduction of the risk that the spread of HIV/AIDS infection will enter the rapid growth phase;
*  Reduction in the rate of population growth;
*  Increased effectiveness and efficiency of public sector services, including reduction of system loss;
*  Strengthened poverty reduction efforts through better targeting of scarce resources;
a  Empowerment of women, the poor, and marginalized groups to influence program decision-making
through stakeholder participation.
Institutional Benefits.
*  Reorganization of MOHFW to promote ability of the Secretariat to manage the sector program and
end the split between Directorates of Health Services and Family Welfare;
3 Reforrn of MOHFW financial and budgeting processes (RIBEC);
*  Establishment of an ongoing HRD function to rationalize staffing and personnel management
procedures;
3  Availability of family planning and other primary health care services at a single site ('one-stop
shopping');
-  Promotion of decentralization program and hospital management.
Target Populations. This sector project targets those without adequate access to quality health and family
planning services. In general, better-off households already have access to such services including
modern private sector services. Hence, benefits from improvements in the availability and quality of
public sector services through project support will accrue in greater proportion to poorer households.
Since the project puts special emphasis on improving the health of women and children through
improvements in reproductive and child health services, the approximately 16 million young children
below the age of five and 25 million married women of reproductive age make up the project's primary
target populations. Since about 50 percent of households are considered to be below the poverty line in
Bangladesh, the impoverished half of these two groups constitute the project's particular targets.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: 1998-2003
Executing agency: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of Bangladesh
Project Coordination and Oversight. A Program Preparation Cell under the Joint Chief Planning,
MOHFW prepared the project and is expected to be responsible for project coordination, monitoring and
evaluation as the Program Coordination Cell (PCC). The main mechanism for project oversight will be
the Annual Program Review (APR), which will be organized by the PCC and will involve all
development partners who support the sector. Actual expenditures and achievements will be reviewed

Bangladesh                                                                     Page 5 of 16
against previously agreed expenditure plans and program indicators, and on this basis new expenditure
and operational plans for the coming year will be agreed, taking into account adjustments indicated by
progress and experience.
IDA and the other HPPP development partners will establish a mechanism for ongoing coordination and
assistance to MOHFW utilizing lessons learned through a review of the role and functions of the donor-
supported Population and Health Office (PHO) in the Bank's Bangladesh Dhaka Office. The Bank-led
consortium of development partners active in the HNP sector in Bangladesh is one of the most effective
coordination efforts of its kind.
Accounting, financial reportin,g and auditing arrangements. The Management Accounting Unit (MAU)
in MOHFW will ensure that there are adequate numbers of experienced staff who understand the relevant
accounting concepts and IDA regulations. MAU will gather required information to prepare consolidated
financial statements for the sector program and will also maintain consolidated accounts for all program
expenditures. A centralized, computerized financial reporting system is being established in the
MOHFW in consultation with the Reforms in Budgeting and Expenditure Control Project (RIBEC) of the
Ministry of Finance. A standardized financial reporting format being developed by IDA and MOHFW
will provide quarterly financial management reports based on RIBEC-designed formats.
For statutory audit purposes, the Controller and Auditor General (C&AG), through the Directorate of
Foreign-Aided Projects, carries out audits of foreign-aided projects. The project financial statements and
SOEs will be audited annually in accordance with INTOSAI auditing standards. The audit reports will be
submitted to IDA and other development partners no later than six months after the end of each fiscal
year. In addition to the C& AG audits, performance audits will be carried out by a private audit firm
selected under appropriate bidding procedures which has the necessary expertise to undertake an
performance audit including an inventory audit and physical verification of assets procured by the
program. The performance will provide adequate assurance to donor agencies that the support provided
has been utilized with due regard to economy and efficiency. Terms of reference for the performance
audits together with sample audit reports are given in Annex 6.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements. Key indicators are given in Annex 1. MOHFW and
development partners will carry out a joint Annual Program Review (APR) based on agreed monitoring
indicators and benchmarks. While the ultimate aim is to be able to monitor changes in impact indicators
(e.g. fertility, mortality), initially the emphasis will be on monitoring of input and process (leading)
indicators (e.g. coverage of MCH services). Data for selected APR indicators, as well as for ongoing
monitoring of the program at all appropriate levels, will be derived from a combination of sources. Five
management information subsystems, for services, logistics, human resources, financial management, and
epidemiology are at differernt stages of development; all will contribute to program monitoring and will
be strengthened as needed. The periodic Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) will be continued.
Additionally, the Integrated Household Survey Program of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics will
continue to provide periodic data on household characteristics, utilization and coverage of services, etc.
Surveys of client and service provider attitudes and experience will be carried out on a regular basis, and
the PCC will commission special studies as needed.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Project alternatives were considered at two levels: the approach to lending and the delivery strategy.
Consideration was given to a more targeted project approach focusing on diseases-specific interventions
and institutional development elements. The main reasons for rejecting a projectized approach in favor of



Project Appraisal Document                                        Health and Population Program Project
Bangladesh                                                                       Page 6 of 16
a sector-wide approach included (i) limited flexibility to reallocate resources if projects fail or priorities
change, (ii) inability to ensure appropriate share of sector resources for priority services and to address
resource ftingibility issue within sector, (iii) limited promotion of institutional capacity building, and (iv)
less capacity to rationalize spending. Similar reasons existed for rejecting an alternative of targeting
investments to primary care and maternal health. Moreover, focusing project resources on the primary
care and maternal health would create more dependence on external funds for essential services (donor
and lender trap) and limit the ability to leverage sector resources.
The design of the ESP delivery system is critical for the success of the sector program. Continuation with
the current bifurcated and disjointed system was rejected because it does not adequately respond to the
needs of maternal health and clinical contraception and limits the potential for increasing the range,
quality and effectiveness of services. A series of stakeholder consultations to consider alternatives was
therefore held (Section E7). Drawing on lessons from the existing system, consensus was reached on the
need to shift to an integrated delivery system based on the establishment by communities of a community
clinics where field workers would provide basic services to a population of 6,000. The site will be not
more than a half hour journey any client, and field workers will continue to make domicillary visits to
priority households as needed.

Australia, Canada, Germany (GTZ, KfW), The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom
supported the First and Second Projects. Sweden withdrew from the Third Project but again supported
the Fourth Project, the EU joined the Fourth Project. USAID is a member of the consortium of
development partners (Section C4) and has participated in preparation of HPPP. The current USAID-
supported National Integrated Population and Health Program is consistent with the HPSS, and this
project will be reviewed at the time of the annual review of HPPP as well.
The IDA-supported Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition Project (Cr. 2735-BD, effective 1996) pilots a
community-based nutrition strategy through NGOs; initial results are encouraging. An ADB-assisted
urban primary health care project also implemented through NGOs became effective in 1998.
3. Lesson learned and reflected in the project design:
The following lessons, which emerged from a review of relevant papers1 and project experience, have
been incorporated into the design of HPPP:
"FPHP [Fourth Project] Mid-Term Review"; "Lessons learned from the current and past IDA-Cofinanciers
funded Population and Health Projects"; "Bangladesh The Determinants of Reproductive Change" (Report
10389-BD); and " Meeting Report--GOB and donor consultation for the future population and health program
Sept. 1995". OED has published two reports on the program: "The World Bank and Bangladesh's Population
Program" June 28, 1991 (Report No. 9751), and "Population and the World Bank, Implications from Eight
Case Studies" February 1992.

4. Indications of Borrower commitment and ownership:
There is very substantial Borrower commitment to and ownership of HPPP. MOHFW played a leading
role in developing the HPSS and then led the effort that resulted in its formal approval by GOB in August
1997. For the preparation of HPPP, MOHFW organized a log frame workshop that included stakeholders
from the public and private sectors and subsequently constituted 17 preparation task forces with similarly
broad membership. Additionally, GOB increased development budget allocations to the sector, retained
key senior MOHFW officers to facilitate preparation of HPPP, and established a High Level Committee
(HLCOM) to address long-standing needs for organization and management reforrns in the sector. The
report of the HLCOM has been accepted by the Cabinet.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
IDA has been involved in the Bangladesh health and population sector since 1975 and has contributed
significantly to its substantial achievements. Continued involvement through HPPP will permit the
unfinished agenda to be addressed, as follows:
*  IDA's leadership of a umique consortium of development partners (cited in WDR93 and elsewhere)
has enabled coordinated development of HPSS and HPPP in partnership with GOB. The alternative
would have been a series of weakly coordinated donor-led projects with limited potential for
achievement of development objectives.
*  IDA involvement in HPPP preparation has resulted in disciplined and focused approach to policy
development and planning, as evidenced by a rational, prioritized approach to resource allocation,
program-oriented financial and management information systems, and a well-developed strategy for
stakeholder participation.

*  The HPPP reform agenda incorporates the 1994 Program of Action of the International Conference
on Population and Development (ICPD, Cairo). Without IDA involvement, MOHFW would likely
maintain the current bifurcated service delivery system, which constitutes a barrier to an integrated
reproductive health approach.
*  Lack of IDA support and leadership could seriously jeopardize past achievements in child survival
and fertility reduction. The IDA-led consortium not only accounts for a sizable share of sector
resources but also provides key technical assistance as well as advocacy for reform.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
l. Economic (Annex 4): [x] Cost Effectiveness Analysis [x] Other: (Distributional, Demand)
Economic analysis undertaken for this program included: (i) a resource prioritization exercise using cost-
effectiveness information, burden of disease inforrnation, and public good and externalities analysis; (ii)
impact analysis; (iii) sector efficiency analysis and a facility efficiency study; and (iv) distributional
analysis using a benefit incidence study, econometric behavioral models, and qualitative consumer
consultation activities.
Economic Justification. HPPP is designed to improve the effectiveness and equity of public spending on
health and population services by earmarking 60-65 percent of resources to an essential services package
(ESP), a subset of the package of services identified in the WDR93, and to improve the efficiency of the
service delivery by reforming the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Public finance of these
interventions is justified in terms of strong elements of a public good or clear positive externalities, e.g.
Behavior Change Communication, Communicable Disease Control, and child health. Further, these
services target diseases associated with the poorest in Bangladesh and are delivered at facilities most
likely to serve the poor. Some services, such as reproductive health interventions, address historic gender
inequalities in accessing the services. Family planning interventions in ESP address both the unmet
needs of parents wishing to limit family size and the educational elements of reducing desired family size.
The reform effort under HPPP addresses the inefficient bifurcation of the MOHFW by eliminating
redundant structures at both the delivery and administrative levels and providing consumers with one-
stop services and more options for meeting reproductive health care needs.
Efficiency Gains and Impact. Analysis of quantifying expected efficiency gains focused on increased
outputs at the same level of staffing. The delivery strategies of HPPP and the targeting of resources at
cost-effective services will increase coverage for essential services, e.g. an increase in ARI detection and
treatment frorn 33 to 80 percent coverage, increase in Malaria control from a baseline of 20 percent
coverage to 70 percent, and increasing TT vaccination for pregnant women from a baseline of 60 percent
coverage to 90 percent. Detailed estimates by level of care delivery are available in project
documentation and Annex 4. The detailed information on expected effective coverage changes for each
of the interventions of ESP (7 interventions under Reproductive Health, 8 under Child Health, 6 under
Communicable Disease Control) by service delivery level (community outreach/satellite clinic, union
level, and thana level) translate into impact measured by healthy life years gained.
Distributional Impact (including poverty impact). Benefit incidence analysis identified winners and
losers in the current system. The poorest and least educated members of society, rural residents, and
women receive less of the government subsidy than do other groups, e.g., the richest 20 percent in society
are three times as likely as the poorest 20 percent to seek care at a hospital when ill and four times as
likely to be admitted for in-patient care when they visit a hospital. To confirm these findings and provide
a basis for policy decisions, quantitative behavioral approach analyses were performed and qualitative
consumer consultations were conducted. Policy relevant findings from this demand-based analysis were
used in program design to address equity concerns and to strengthen the GOB's poverty alleviation

strategies. Relevant policies included: (i) an ESP designed to address diseases of the poor and
vulnerable (including services to address maternal mortality and gender specific health needs); (ii) a
delivery strategy for ESP to ensure that a sizable share of the total public budget is targeted at facilities
likely to serve the poor and vulnerable; (iii) a Behavior Change Communication strategy to address the
informational needs of vulnerable groups and to improve treatment by providers; (iv) a qualitative and
quantitative monitoring strategy (including an annual review) that involves vulnerable groups and
provides advocacy by focusing attention on distributional issues; and (v) systems to improve the quality
of care (actual and perceived) at facilities frequented by vulnerable groups.
Economic analyses were carried out to address framework and impact questions. In addition to analysis
of justification and impact, analysis of alternatives are covered in sections DI and D5, links to CAS and
ESW in section B 1, risks in section F, and fiscal impact in the next section. Based on the totality of the
economic analysis, the design of HPPP will greatly improve the well-being of vulnerable segments of
Bangladeshi society by leveraging sector resources to target scarce funds at economically justifiable
services in a more efficient delivery system. Moreover, the sustainability of design improvements will be
enhanced by a strong and participatory supervision, monitoring and on-going evaluation taking advantage
of built-in information systems and focusing on activity, output, purpose and goal indicators.
2. Financial (see Annex 4): NPV=NA;    FRR= NA
Fiscal analysis undertaken for this program included: (i) a detailed public expenditure review and
sectoral flow of fund analysis (including the private sector and NGOs); (ii) an assessment of recurrent
cost implications of all capital expenditures; (iii) an assessment of country experience with cost-recovery
and health insurance (public and private); and (iv) analysis of input mix. Findings from the fiscal
analysis have been incorporated into program design.
A key objective of HPPP is to increase the level of resources available for basic, cost-effective health
and population services. This will be achieved by (i) increasing GOB financing of the sector; (ii)
earmarking resources to ESP, (iii) improving the efficiency of service delivery; and (iv) improving
resource mobilization. ESP funding and efficiency are addressed in the previous section.
Increasing GOB contributions to the sector. The recent history on the GOB's commitment to the health
and population sector is encouraging, e.g. from FY95/96 to this fiscal year GOB allocations have
increased by 11 percent in real terms (US$247 million in FY95/96 to US$275 in FY97/98). HPPP will
further expand the Govemrnment's commitment. The GOB and its development partners, including IDA,
will finance a five-year sector program estimated at US$2.9 billion. During the life of the program, GOB
allocations to the sector will increase from 6 percent of total government spending to 7.5 percent in year
2003. External assistance will also increase but at a slower rate lowering the dependency ratio.
Given the historic and strong donor support to the sector in Bangladesh, the issue of external resource
substituting for government financing is of critical importance. A detailed fiscal analysis of fund sources,
using historic trends and expected allocations, clearly shows that external assistance (including IDA) will
not substitute for GOB expenditures. Furthermore, operationally, the annual review and planning process
that the donors and the government will undertake will confirm that fund substitution will not occur. A
detailed analysis was also undertaken to confirm the GOB's ability to absorb expected increases in
allocations.
Improving resource mobilization. A resource mobilization assessment found structural weaknesses in
cost-recovery mechanisms (no revenue retention or recycling and limited consumer empowerment tools
and mechanisms to protect the poor), little experience with rural or formal sector insurance systems, and
no significant cost-sharing with communities. While resource mobilization is not a major focus of HPPP,



Project Appraisal Document                                        Health and Population Program Project
Bangladesh                                                                       Page IO of 16
the design of the program includes important elements of cost-sharing with communities which are
expected to increase ownership of facilities. To address the weaknesses in cost-recovery, two pilots were
designed with revenue retention exemptions and will test empowerment tools and mechanisms for
protecting the poor. Finally, the program will support design and piloting of rural health insurance
systems and a formal sector insurance system. During the third year of HPPP, experience from resource
mobilization pilots will be used to develop a sector strategy for resource mobilization.
GOB's ability to maintain its strong financial commitment to the sector if the macroeconomics picture
changes cannot be assured. However, given the commitments of the last two governments to the social
sectors, continued strong support is likely. A second risk is political pressure to shift more resources
within the sector to highly visible but cost-ineffective new capital investments with major recurrent cost
implications. GOB has agreed to review all proposed new capital investments and associated recurrent
cost implications with the Bank and mutually agree on their inclusion in the proposed expenditure plan
for the coming fiscal year as part of the annual program review process (Section C4).
3. Technical:
The main strengths of the Health and Family Welfare program have been the development of a service
delivery infrastructure and the success of the family planning and immunization programs. Weaknesses
have been the relatively expensive service delivery system, linked to separate delivery of health and
family planning services, and weak institutional and capacity development despite substantial donor
assistance. HPPP, designed from lessons learned from over 20 years of investment in the sector, uses a
program apiproach to address both institutional capacity and service delivery coverage and efficiency
issues. GOB and its partners have considered the public resources available for the entire sector and have
given priority to an essential services package (ESP). The program is thus tailored to the particular
circumstances of Bangladesh.
Because the resources available to GOB are so limited, it has been necessary to design the essential
services package very carefully. The four components of ESP--Child Care, Reproductive Health,
Communicable Disease Control, and Limited Care--were identified on the basis of the epidemiological
situation (infectious diseases and maternal morbidity/mortality still predominate) and the programs
identified in WDR93 as the most cost effective for a county such as Bangladesh. Starting from existing
PHC interventions, ESP provides for a reorientation focusing on reproductive and maternal health and a
"one stop" unified delivery mechanism that meets client needs more efficiently. The Child Care
component clusters existing services to improve access and coverage while improving quality through
introduction of the WHO concept of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). Reproductive
Health receives substantial attention in order to improve family planning service quality, reduce
discontinuation rates, increase use of clinical contraception, and develop a maternal health program; an
STD program, part of the larger national HIV/AIDS program, is under development and will be tested
during the project. Communicable Disease Control concentrates resources on treatment of sputum-
positive TB cases using the DOTS approach; initial results under the Fourth Project are quite
encouraging. Kala azar and malaria control programs will continue. The program has excellent access to
technical assistance through the specialized agencies (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA) as well as support
provided by bilateral development partners to ensure that programs continue to be up to date technically.
Annex 6 of thLe PIP lists all ESP activities and describes what will be delivered to whom, by whom, with
what training and other support, and with what periodicity
4. Institutional:
Public Sector. The MOHFW, the chief public sector provider of health and family planning services, is a
large and complex organization; management is centralized, hierarchical, non-participatory, and to a large
extent dependent on personal rather than professional considerations. As noted in the HPSS and the
HLCOM report, separate Family Planning and Health Directorates with separate cadres at all levels,

which dates back to the 1970s, results in an organizational structure unsuitable for sustainable and cost-
effective delivery of essential services. Previous efforts to address the issue through functional
integration of services and other coordination mechanisms have failed; therefore Govemment constituted
a High Level Committee for Organization and Management Restructuring whose recommendations for
unification of service delivery and reorganization of the Directorates have been accepted by the Cabinet.
Key reform measures have been detailed by MOHFW in their program implementation plan. The
MOHFW Secretariat will be reorganized and management capacity will be strengthened through
appropriate training as well as technical support from a Change Management Unit. Human resources
development (HRD) measures will include modification of the existing skewed skills mix and
introduction of appropriate performance appraisal and suitable incentive structures.
NGOs. NGOs play a major role in Bangladesh development efforts and are particularly known for their
development of micro credit and women's empowerment programs. There are over 500 NGOs working
in the HNP sectors, ranging from quite small community-based groups to large, internationally known
organizations such as BRAC (Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee), which covers some 17
million people. Currently these NGOs work in some 330 out of 489 thanas and are primarily involved in
the provision of family planning and maternal-child health services. NGOs provide family planning
services to about a quarter of eligible couples and have achieved impressive results: contraceptive
prevalence in NGO areas is currently abut 60 percent as compared to about 45 percent in areas served by
the government program alone. An NGO funding mechanism, the Bangladesh Population and Health
Consortium, developed under the Fourth Project will be continued under HPPP; it also provides support
in the areas of auditing, monitoring and capacity building for the small NGOs supported. The USAID-
funded National Integrated Health and Family Planning Project channels support to the essential services
.package entirely through NGOs, and the ADB-supported Urban Health Project will also rely almost
entirely on NGOs for service delivery. GOB-NGO relationships have at times been strained but with the
establishment of several coordination mechanisms have improved in recent years.
Social Marketing. Social marketing plays an increasingly important and cost-effective role in the
distribution of contraceptives and other key commodities, for example oral rehydration packets. Social
marketing accounts for about 70 percent of condom and about 20 percent of oral contraceptive
distribution, and these levels may increase further. Social marketing has also helped to increase use of
oral rehydration therapy (CIRT) overall and oral rehydration packets in particular. There is substantial
potential for social marketing of other commodities as well. Given the proven effectiveness of social
marketing in Bangladesh, the project will continue to provide commodities for social marketing purposes.
Private-for-Profit Sector. The private-for-profit health sector is large and diverse, ranging from
technologically sophisticated facilities in Dhaka to the traditional practitioners widely available in rural
areas, while most qualified practitioners are concentrated in urban areas. Most doctors in government
service also have private practices. It is estimated that 50 percent of total sector resources are expended
in the private sector and that 80 percent of visits by individuals seeking health care for themselves or their
children are to unqualified practitioners. However, most preventive interventions are provided through
public or NGO services. UJnder HPPP, a private sector regulatory framework will be developed, and pilot
efforts to promote links between the public and private sectors will be undertaken.
5. Social:
Beneficiary needs and behavior. Society in Bangladesh is still predominantly rural, agricultural,
traditional, and patrilineal. Sons are preferred over daughters and are often given preference in access to
resources including food, education, and health care. Traditionally, rural women were restricted to their
households and seldom traveled or worked outside their homes. However, the achievements of the GOB
family planning and immunization programs as well as the results of many NGO projects demonstrate

Bangladesh                                                                     Page 12 of 16
that despite substantial social and economic constraints, successful promotion of behavioral change is
possible. Feedback from many sources indicates clearly that barriers to expanded coverage of essential
health services and improved utilization of health facilities, particularly by women and poor households,
involve priimarily the availability, quality, and appropriateness of services. Results of stakeholder
consultations held as part of project preparation underline that access to services is meaningless if they
are so poor that people do not want to or cannot use them, e.g. absence or staff and/or supplies and
equipment, buildings in poor repair that do not provide adequate privacy and toilet facilities, particularly
for women, rude and improper behavior by staff. HPPP will address these issues through a broad variety
of activities, including one-stop availability of primary care services, refurbishment and upgrading of
facilities, development of community accountability mechanisms, reorientation of program staff, and
other behavior change efforts.
Indigenous peoples. According to the 1991 census, Bangladesh has a tribal population of 1.2 million, or
about one percent of the total population. More. than 40 percent of the tribal population is concentrated in
the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT); the rest are scattered. GOB has a special development program for the
CHT, which is implemented with UNICEF support. UNICEF has recruited and trained tribal workers,
and in a number of key social areas including primary education and primary health care the program has
been effective. Project preparation consultations were held with two major CHT tribal groups, and
identified needs for special efforts to ensure inputs, develop community involvement, and monitor
effectiveness were discussed with MOHFW and UNICEF. The recent agreement between GOB and the
CHT tribal groups to end a long-standing insurgency in the area should make it possible to significantly
improve implementation of the CHT program. The progress of the CHT program will be reviewed as
part of the Annual Program Review.
6. Environmental assessment. Environmental Category   [ ] A   [x] B   [ ] C
Bangladesh faces very serious ecological and environmental difficulties, many of which will be addressed
by an IDA-supported Bangladesh Environment Project (BEP) now under development. Measures to deal
with the serious problem of arsenic contamination of the water supply in some rural areas will be
supported through an IDA-supported project for mitigation of arsenic contamination currently under
development. The health component of the arsenic project will be implemented by MOHFW.
Many of the increasing environmental pressures facing Bangladesh derive to a major extent from
population pressures. Continued support through HPPP for GOB's efforts to sustain the substantial
fertility decline achieved over the last two decades is therefore essential. While population will continue
to grow as a consequence of the age structure of the population, the rate of growth and the ultimate size
of the population can be reduced. Improved quality of reproductive health services as well as education
of girls will play key roles in achieving these objectives
All program construction, which will involve primarily refurbishment and upgrading of existing facilities,
will be carried out following acceptable standards. There will be no resettlement of any population.
However, since the program will address one environment issue of some consequence, management of
medical wastes, the project is designated as Category B. To address medical waste management,
MOHFW will first carry out a diagnostic study to identify sources, types, quantities, and present disposal
of wastes generated by all types of medical facilities. A second study will make recommendations in
three areas: (i) technical options available for management of the types of wastes found; (ii) the existing
regulatory framework; and (iii) institutional requirements for management and implementation of a waste
management program. By June 30, 1999, MOHFW expects to develop a comprehensive phased action
plan, which will be coordinated with the BEP and discussed with IDA and other development partners. It
is anticipated that while substantial implementation progress can be made within the project period, a
longer period of time will be required for completion of the entire plan.

7. Participatory approach.
Stakeholder consultations were part of the development of GOB's HPSS. To expand stakeholder
involvement in the preparation of HPPP, MOHFW constituted a Task Force on Stakeholder Participation,
chaired by a Joint Secretary, to guide the process. A stakeholder mapping and analysis were conducted
and three broad categories (primary or clients, secondary or providers, and external groups) were
identified; groups included NGOs, women's organizations, political parties, local government,
professional associations, and members of civil society. Focus on gender and socio-economic equity was
identified as an objective of the process.
Prior to appraisal, the consultative process included: (i) client and field worker consultations in five
thanas using a participatory rural appraisal technique; and (ii) 12 district-level workshops (100
participants each) organized by MOHFW and facilitated by NGOs and women's organizations.
Outcomes included consensus on aspects of health needs and services in both public and private sectors
and on the importance of client-centered services and establishment of accountability. The process
developed a multi-pronged implementation strategy for ESP reflecting differing socio-economic
circumstances and gender needs in different regions of the country. Establishment of local groups for
participatory implementation and monitoring of HPPP was begun, and dialogues with professional
associations concerning quality assurance were opened. The Annual Project Review, on which project
support for the following year will be based, will draw on stakeholder inputs and experience, including
surveys and an ongoing consultative process at three levels, in the review process.
The emphasis on participation in project preparation was difficult and time consuming. However, it
resulted in a corresponding emphasis on client-centered provision of services as well as gender and pro-
poor agendas in program design and laid the groundwork for development of transparency and
accountability mechanisms in the health system.
F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Ownership. For HPPP to achieve its development objectives, major stakeholders, including clients, need
to contribute to the design, implementation and monitoring of the program. The extensive participatory
process that began with the development of the sector strategy (section E7 above) and will be carried into
program implementation has resulted in strong ownership on the part of the stakeholders involved.
Institutional Sustainability. To effectively manage a sector-wide program, the MOHFW Secretariat will
be reorganized along lines recommended by expert technical assistance with the assistance of a Change
Management Cell. Financial reporting and management aspects are already being reformed through the
RIBEC initiative. In support of unified service delivery, the Ministry's Directorates will be reorganized
in the course of the project along lines outlined by the HLCOM.
Financial Sustainability. The health population sector in Bangladesh continues to be dependent on
external financial assistance. The design of HPPP aims at decreasing dependence through the life of the
project and beyond. Steps taken include (i) increased financial commitmnent to the sector by the
Government, (ii) improvenments in resource mobilization efforts through health insurance, community
cost sharing, and cost-recovery, and (iii) improvements in the efficiency of resource use and allocations
within the public sector.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Social: Although there is strong emphasis in the program on gender and on stakeholder (including
beneficiary) involvement, it is not foreseen that this will be controversial in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh                                                                      Page 15 of 16
Governance: HPPP gives a great deal of importance to issues of governance. Possible areas of
controversy include:
*  reorganization of the MOH1FW Directorates. This reform may be seen by some in the Family
Planning Directorate as not in their interest. However, GOB has been careful to address the concerns
of the FP unions, and the risk of disruption of services is now quite small.
*  introduction of hospital autonomy. This will be opposed by the powerful unions of the lower grade
workers who have previously succeeded in preventing this reform. The GOB will pilot the reform on
a limited scale and demonstrate to the workers that their concerns can be accommodated.
*  decentralization to district and Thana levels. The doctors may not support the establishment of
independent authorities and setting up of "provider-purchaser" agreements because these might
interfere with the "job for life" basis of the cadre system. GOB will mitigate opposition by dialogue
and by allowing doctors to be seconded to the new authorities.
*  expansion of cost recovery within the sector. GOB is sensitive to the issues and will expand existing
limited provision for cost: recovery slowly and involve stakeholders in the process. Present
indications are that beneficiaries are prepared to pay for quality services at fixed prices.
Management: Reorganization of the MOHFW Secretariat will involve such controversial measures as
changing the Business Orders and the titles of positions. The Secretary will minimize opposition by not
changing the numbers or seniority of posts. Assignment of responsibility for programs currently
managed by project directors to line managers of the Directorates, entailing loss of substantial benefits to
the previous project directors, will also generate opposition. To deal with this, the program will support
improvements in the offices of the line directors and their staffs.

Detailed Project Description
N.B. Project costs by component are given in Annex 3; project costs by expenditure
category are given in Annex 6, Table C.
1.     Delivery of Essential Services Package and Other Services
a. Essential Services Package (US$1,624.76 Million)
Overview. The Essential Service Package (ESP) is a set of interventions which have been selected to
address the most important health needs of the population. The interventions chosen are among the
most cost effective for a low-income country with the disease profile of Bangladesh (Annex 8 and
WDR 93) and meet felt needs of the clients. Provision of the package is designed to strengthen
service delivery and management. Size and scope are limited by resource constraints. Government
has agreed that at least 60 percent of the public resources available to the sector, i.e. 60 percent of
approximately US$4 per capita, will be allocated for support of ESP. Within ESP, the highest
priorities are (a) interventions that have public-good character (i.e., are not excludable and have
important externalities); and (b) interventions related to maternal and child health.
ESP comprises: Reproductive Health Care, Child Health Care, Communicable Disease Control and
Limited Curative Care. A detailed description of each ESP activity at each level of care (community,
union, thana, district) is shown in Annex 6 of the Government's Program Implementation Plan (PIP)
together with the priority of the activity; target population; commodities needed and their cost (cost of
consumables); coverage of YO (1997-98), Y1 (1998-99) and Year 5 (2002-03); and the total cost. At
present, service delivery at all levels is provided by separate cadres for health and for family planning
services. With the agreed restructuring of the MOHFW, services at thana level and below will be
unified. The ESP strategy provides for a shift from existing domicillary services to fixed site services
at community clinics for populations of 6,000, although workers will also continue to make
domiciliary visits to priority households as needed complemented by monthly mobile services from
Family Welfare Visitors. (PIP Annex 5). ESP will build on this to establish mechanisms for expanded
community participation. Medical officers are posted at 1275 unions, but there are many problems
with this arrangement. The project will support the construction of 100 quarters at the union level as
part of a test program to understand what is needed to retain good quality medical officers' services at
union level, before any further investment is made in creating more medical officer posts at this level.
The existing physical infrastructure, including union health and family welfare centers (UHFWCs)
and thana health complexes (THCs), will be suitable for ESP delivery in the rural areas but will need
to be upgraded somewhat to improve quality of care under ESP, especially maternal health care. In
urban areas, MOHFW has only a limited preventive and promotive health care infrastructure. A mix
of private, NGO and government hospital facilities providing mainly curative services complement
this. In the absence of any well-organized formal structure for providing health and family planning
services in urban areas, the Government's strategy is for the MOLGRD to rely on improved and
expanded collaboration with NGOs and the private sector with support from a large ADB-financed
project.
Behavior change communication (BCC), particularly in support of client-oriented services, is a high
priority for the ESP. Client orientation will require a shift in the attitudes of providers and managers,
from serving the system to serving the people for whom the system is designed. Client focus cuts
across coverage and quality of services, cost-effectiveness, and accountability. Since BCC is also
essential for other levels of care, BCC interventions are described under Integrated Support Services.



Annex 2
- 22 -                                   Page3 ofl7
Reproductive Health Care comprises safe pregnancy, maternal nutrition and safe delivery; family
planning; addressing reproductive morbidity and mortality including prevention of unsafe abortion;
prevention, control and treatment of RTIs/STDs/AIDS and infertility; adolescent care; and neo-natal
care.
Safe motherhood encompasses basic and comprehensive essential obstetric care (EOC) including
antenatal care, tetanus toxoid immunization, detection and management of pregnancy complications
and screening of high-risk pregnancies, attendance at normal delivery by trained personnel, obstetric
first aid, referral, provision of services for complicated delivery and post-natal care. The national
strategy (PIP Annex 9) incorporates the "three delays" model as well as strategies for improving the
status of women. Maternal malnutrition, improving women's' status, raising awareness about violence
against women, understanding danger signs in pregnancy and labor etc., will be addressed through
BCC. Maternal health care services will be expanded, based on population distribution, to provide
integrated units of community services (including training community midwives), obstetric first aid,
basic and comprehensive EOC services. Increasingly sophisticated services at each level of the
system, with a capacity to provide comprehensive EOC at specified thana health complexes (THCs)
and all district hospitals will be provided, and a referral system will be developed.
Family planning services will continue to provide a range of services for clients to choose from. The
program will focus on increasing the use of modern contraceptive methods and will aim to increase
distribution of oral contraceptives and condoms. There will be increased emphasis on improved
counseling and client choice as well as an increased use of quality clinical contraception. Low
perforrning areas and under-served groups will receive special attention.
Prevention and Control of RTIs/STDs/AIDS and Infertility. Prevention and treatment of STDs/RTIs
will additionally prevent HIV infection and infertility to some extent (PIP Annex 10). The main focus
will be on BCC and condom promotion. In addition, as part of the national AIDS strategy, the
Government will adopt syndromic management of STDs with appropriate referral services. The
incorporation of syndromic management will be phased in, with initial emphasis given to high-risk
behaviior groups and piloting in rural and urban areas.
Adolescent Care. Adolescents in Bangladesh constitute about a quarter of the total population. Son
preference and low status of women are affecting girl adolescents' nutrition, education and access to
health care. Early marriage and early matrimony affect their overall health status. Only when they
are married do adolescent girls get maternal care or family planning services; unmarried adolescents
may not have access to health care of any kind. Specific BCC messages concerning nutrition and
hygienic practices, puberty, safe sexual behavior and how to avoid health risks will be addressed to
adolescents.
Neo-natal Care. These services, mainly at domiciliary and union levels, include: health education for
mothers on cleanliness and breast-feeding; thermal control; management of birth asphyxia; routine
eye prophylaxis; special care of pre-term and low birth weight babies
Child Health Care. Child Health Care encompasses basic preventative and curative care for infants
and children. There are existing control programs for acute respiratory infection (ARI), diarrheal
diseases, vaccine-preventable diseases and prevention of micronutrient deficiency disorders.
GOB will now manage them on an integrated basis and will begin to adopt the WHO-recommended
Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI), with improved care for sick children provided
within easy reach of their homes.



Annex 2
Page 4 of 17
Malnutrition is the key compounding factor for infant and child mortality. Chronic energy
deficiency, protein energy malnutrition, low birth weight, and micronutrient deficiencies are all
serious health problems in Bangladesh. The program will address malnutrition and micronutrient
deficiencies through the ESP interventions, and the existing salt iodization program will be
maintained. Additionally, the Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition Project (BINP) will eventually be
expanded to cover the whole country.
Communicable Disease Control. The major interventions are for communicable diseases with a
severe health impact, e.g., TB, leprosy, malaria, kala azar, intestinal parasites, and some other
emerging and re-emerging diseases, including HIV/AIDS. The prevalence of tuberculosis is about
200/100,000 population (nearly 240,000 cases). Malaria, though a serious problem in some districts,
accounts for only about 600,000 cases a year, which affect all age groups.
The successful TB and leprosy control projects, which aim to eradicate leprosy and control TB, will
be continued. The TB control program uses the latest WHO-endorsed strategy: primary health care-
based Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course (DOTS) for TB. For vector-borne diseases,
particularly malaria and kala azar, the accepted WIO-recommended Strategy for Early Diagnosis &
Prompt Treatment (EDPT) will be strengthened. Under HPPP, the implementation of all of these
programs will be strengthened through unified service delivery and improved management for all
disease control activities.
Limited Curative Care. Care for common ailments and injuries must be provided because an
Essential Service Package has to meet public expectations for these services. Government resources
are needed to provide basic first aid, treatment of medical emergencies, pain relief and advice. Such
services are especially important for the poor. The resources available will limit the amount of service
provided.
b. Hospital Services (US$348.0 Million)
Public sector hospitals offer three-quarters of all hospital-based services and currently use about 40
percent of MOHFW resources. Emphasis will be given to developing partnerships with or
commissioning services of NGOs and private not-for-profit hospitals and to a larger and better-
regulated role for the private sector. The improvement of public sector hospitals will involve greater
management autonomy combined with local accountability. A pilot program will be conducted
involving one Medical College Hospital and a District Hospital to learn how best to implement this
approach. It is envisaged that as hospitals become autonomous they will be appropriately supplied to
provide the expected range of services. Autonomy combined with local level accountability will
contribute to improving the quality of services. Norms and standards for quality of clinical and non-
clinical services will be developed and institutionalized through a medical audit system managed by the
DGHS. A special group of Health Managers will be trained and deployed to district hospitals first and
later to the tertiary level. Particular attention will be given to skill-mix through redefining the human
resources requirements for hospitals.
Using the results of pilot programs, cost-recovery will be introduced for outpatient registration, drugs,
inpatient care, surgical operations and diagnostic services. The detailed pricing and cost-recovery
mechanisms will be developed during project implementation. In order to have a safety net for the poor,
guidelines for identification of the poor and modalities for meeting their payments will be decided.

Page 5 of 17
An in-depth study will be carried out to assess the problems of medical and biological waste disposal in
hospitals. Based on study findings, an environmentally acceptable program for hospital waste
management will be designed and implemented.
Government will promote and assist the establishment of not-for-profit (socially motivated) private
sector or NGO hospitals utilizing block grants. Government will also support the development of for-
profit private hospitals by providing them access to industrial incentives.
Districl Hospitals. District Hospitals will be strengthened and upgraded to enable them to provide a full
range of referral services to complement the ESP. Resources will be focused on a limited range of basic
secondary-level services, especially those for reproductive health and medical/surgical emergencies. The
inputs vvill include improvement of physical facilities, with particular emphasis on services for mothers
and babies and on supply of basic diagnostic and other necessary equipment. Upvvard referral of
serious and complicated conditions and periodic downward visits of experts will be systematically
arranged.
Medical College Hospitals. Improvement of physical facilities and quality of services for the tertiary-
level hospitals attached to the Medical Colleges and six Post-Graduate Institutes will be limited and will
take account of recurrent cost implications for the sector. Specialized self-sustaining autonomous
agencies will be strengthened or established as necessary to provide blood-bank seivices to all hospitals,
both in the public and private sectors. So far as possible, ancillary services will be contracted out.
Director (Hospitals) will be entrusted with establishing policies, standards and mechanisms for
monitoring them through hospital management boards.
c. Other Public Health Services (US$9.56 Million)
Environmental and Industrial Occupational Health including Arsenic Pollution in Drinking
Water. Bangladesh is undergoing rapid urbanization, resulting in environmental pollution
particularly affecting water and air quality. Location of hazardous industrial plants such as leather
tanneries very close to densely populated slums inhabited by the hard-core poor is likely to cause a
number of health problems including those due to chromium intoxication. Similarly, the serious
threat of chronic obstructive lung diseases caused by jute particles in the large number of jute mills in
and around Dhaka and some other parts of the country has not received adequate attention. A WHO-
suppoited inter-ministerial and inter-departmental workshop has developed an action plan. The
project will assist the MOHFW in implementing this plan, the costs being limited to an agreed amount
each year. The main approach will be through the Environment Directorate, which is conducting
monitoring activities on environmental impacts and developing a project (Bangladesh Environmental
Project) with the Bank.
Extensive use of deep tubewells for irrigation appears to have resulted in the appearance of arsenic
compounds in shallow tubewell drinking water in some areas of Bangladesh. The victims of arsenic
poisoning are mostly rural poor. The Bank will support a Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Project to
reduce mortality and morbidity. that is currently under preparation. MOHFW will cooperate with the
national effort to develop a reporting system through the diagnosis of affected patients as well as
case management of chronic arsenic intoxication. BCC efforts will be used to discourage drinking of
contaminated tubewell water and encourage the use of safe water. A series of coordinated studies will
be instituted in consultation with national and international agencies to make recommendations for
long-term solutions to the problem

Health Emergency Preparedness and Response. Bangladesh remains subject to repeated natural
disasters. There are direct public health consequences of these unpredictable events, which also
compete for the scarce financial and manpower resources. To mitigate the problem, some
groundwork was laid in the Fourth Five-Year Plan for a well-organized, rapid and efficient response.
A National Center for Health Emergency Preparedness and Response has been proposed by the
MOHFW. The proposal was reviewed at appraisal and further critical analysis will be undertaken
before investments are made.
Emerging and Re-emerging Diseases. A number of emerging diseases including Hepatitis B need
attention due to their chronicity and potential for causing epidemics as well as fatalities. Rabies and a
few other animal-bome zoonosis also deserve attention. During the Fourth Health and Population
Project the Institute for Epidemiology and Disease Control ( IEDCR) was identified and supported to
provide monitoring and surveillance services. IEDCR did not improve its capabilities and does not
have the capacity to monitor emerging and re-emerging diseases. The disease control part of the
DGHS will be selectively strengthened to improve disease surveillance and outbreak investigation.
School Health Services. School health services will include training of school teachers to provide
first aid to school students using a First Aid Box in every school. At least one school teacher per
school will be trained for this purpose during their basic or in-service training. The Health Education
Officer in THC will visit the schools in the thana. The program will need to be managed in
collaboration with the Ministry of Education. Trained teachers may also identify students who need to
be referred for examination and treatment. Teachers will provide Health Education to the students,
mainly on hygienic practices and communicable disease control. Students may act as communicators
for the family and the community for some essential aspects of BCC. Students can participate in
sanitation and cleanliness programs in the villages with the help of their teachers.
Inter-Sectoral Approach. HPSS recognizes that many factors affect health and population
outcomes. It calls for a multi-sectoral approach to understand and address these factors at the policy
and program level in and beyond the public sector. MOHFW is already taking a leading role in this
arena, for example through the integrated nutrition program, which involves the Ministries of
Agriculture and Home Affairs as well as many NGOs. HPPP will involve inter-sectoral coordination
in such areas as BCC. Recognizing that population and health policy require inter-sectoral
coordination, GOB will encourage other ministries to undertake or support programs and policies to
promote gender awareness and improved nutrition, to raise the age of marriage and first birth, and
other initiatives to address the changing demographic and epidemiological challenges that Bangladesh
faces.
Prevention and Control of STDslHIV/AIDS. In support of activities for HIV/AIDS control,
strategic planning and monitoring activities at national level, as outlined in the National AIDS Policy,
will be strengthened. A National Strategic Plan and Plan of Action has been formulated, including
examination of the need for new legislation. The plan has benefited from technical assistance from a
number of organizations including UNAIDS, UNDP, UNICEF and WHO. The plan is appropriate for
a country with low HIV prevalence but decisive implementation will require that a single entity be
responsible and accountable for its operations. Collaborative efforts will be undertaken both in the
country and with institutes and programs in other countries in the region.
d. Other Health and Nutrition Services (US$254.0 Million)
Other Health Services. During the project period, other activities and projects are planned as part of
strengthening the network of hiealth and hospital services. These include upgrading of existing



26                                      Annex 2
Page 7 of 17
hospitals as well as establishment of specialized care centers, improvement of drug testing
laboratories, etc. A list of potential projects is given in Annex 3.1.8 of the PIP. Implementation of
specific activities in the coming year will be discussed annually by the Government and the
development partners as part of the Annual Program Review.
Nutrition Services. Government is currently implementing the IDA-assisted Bangladesh Integrated
Nutrition Project (BINP). Initial results have been quite positive. The experience of BINP will be
incorporated in other program nutrition activities, to be managed by a Director Nutrition. A National
Nutrition Program based on and expanding BINP experience, to be supported by IDA, is under
discussion with Government.
e. Support Services (US$629.01 million)
Behavior Change Communication (BCC). The HPSS recognizes the key role of BCC in the
successful implementation of a package of essential services. An investment in effective BCC
adequate to address current gaps in perceptions and behaviors on the part of both service providers
and clients, which constitute a major constraint to program effectiveness, is essential. The emphasis
will be on multi-media, multi-channel, inter-sectoral approaches based on systematic planning
processes to produce creative and innovative communication strategies that utilize research, field
testing and effective monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. To accomplish this, the BCC
compoinent will take maximum advantage of the opportunities provided by the rapidly expanding
commumication networks in Bangladesh and the growing national capacities for planning, designing
and implementing comprehensive and effective development communication programs.
The primary aim of the BCC component will be to support the shift of health and family welfare
service delivery from a ineffective provider-based system to an effective client-oriented, demand-
based system. Such a system will be able to recognize the links between social, gender and health
issues, reach women, children and the poor, and participate in inter-sectoral efforts for community and
women's empowerment. To achieve these goals, the BCC component will develop programs in six
basic areas:
Social change to address the issue of household and community support for the health and well being
of women and children.
Social ownership to promote client, household and community ownership of program service delivery
and facilities; the goal is to enable clients to understand their need for, and entitlement to, quality
essential services and demand them from the system and to build effective community support for
health-seeking behavior.
Provider relations to promote a shift in provider attitudes and practices towards a client-oriented,
socially aware approach to service delivery.
Advocacy to gain concurrence and support from other branches of Government and the general
society, including social, political, community and religious leaders and organizations, and the mass
media. Particular targets will include the Ministries of Information, Education, Religious Affairs and
Local Government, NGOs, and corporate entities.
Promotion of interventions by working to bring adoption of changes in attitudes and behaviors that
will result in improved health status. Promotion of ESP interventions will address social, cultural and
gender attitudes and practices that impede the adoption of beneficial practices. Geographical areas
with low coverage and/or acceptance rates will receive special focus.
Social marketing to promote the incorporation of social, gender and behavior change messages
developed by the BCC component into other existing health programs.

Page S of 17
Current program support to the activities of Bangladesh TV and Bangladesh Broadcasting will be
expanded to other relevant units. A comprehensive review will be conducted with a view to the
integration of currently separate development communication activities (e.g., Population Cells, FFL,
BINP) in order to avoid duplication and overlapping. Strengthened program data collection and
monitoring will reflect the central role of BCC in achieving program objectives. Capacity for training
of service providers will be strengthened, and a center of excellence for training managers of
development communication programs will be developed, possibly in conjunction with an established
university or institution. Additionally, the substantial development communication capacities of the
private sector in Bangladesh, both NGO and for-profit, will be utilized to a much greater extent than at
present.
To support the planning ancl management of program BCC efforts, an autonomous, not-for-profit
institute, modeled on the example of independent corporations, will be established. This institute will
work to ensure creativity, innovation and flexibility in the development of activities to meet program
communication needs. An international consultant will provide technical support.
Management Information Systems (MIS). Availability of accurate and timely program data is
essential to program planning, management and implementation. For this purpose, five MIS
subsystems, now at various stages of development, have been established.
Services/facilities (MIS)
Logistics management (LMIS)
Human Resources (-RIS)
Financial (FMIS)
Epidemiology (EIS)
Under HPPP, parallel units now under the separate HS and FP Directorates will be integrated. In
addition, steps will be taken to ensure the technical compatibility of the five subsystems, although it is
expected that each will be attached to and managed by the functional unit it serves.
For the Services/facilities MIS, attention will be given to rationalization of existing data collection
procedures to eliminate duplication and improve completeness and timeliness of reporting,
modernization through computerization and training, introduction of survey methodology to
complement and supplement existing data collection, development of indicators for monitoring of
ESP, and utilization of MIS clata/indicators for planning and management purposes at all levels. In
addition to standard service delivery compilations, indicators for BCC, gender, pro-poor agenda and
stakeholder participation concerns will be developed.
Human Resources Development. An integrated and needs-based human resource development
(HRD) capacity for the program will be developed and institutionalized, taking into account the
recommendations of the High Level Committee (HLCOM). An HRD implementation plan for HPPP
has been developed, giving each HRD activity, its purposes, implementation strategy, and responsible
implementors. The plan covers the following three HRD areas.
In the area of staffing, the objective will be to ensure an adequate supply of personnel to achieve program
objectives within program resource constraints. This will include determining the required numbers and
mix of personnel (doctors by specialty, dentists, pharnacists, technicians, nurses, field workers, field
supervisors, etc.); ensuring appropriate utilization of posted staff, e.g., by avoiding imbalances
(geographical, by level of care, by type of establishment), and avoiding shortages or surpluses. Under
HPPP, staffing patterns will be gradually rationalized to provide optimal support to ESP delivery and to
reflect the intended population-based allocation of facilities and resources.



2  -                                     Annex 2
Page 9 of 17
In the area of education and training the objective will be to produce appropriately skilled personnel to
meet program needs. This will include the definition and enforcement of training standards as well as
continuous assessment and re-assessment of performance-based training needs with respect to basic as
well as in-service education. Ongoing efforts will be continued to further improve the quality of medical
and nursing education and ensure its appropriateness to community needs. For those involved in the
delivery of ESP, especially fieldworkers and their managers, a comprehensive package of training will be
carried out, which will include the training of community midwives.
Improvements in the area of performance management and personnel administration of program
personnel will be supported. The aim of performance management will be to optimize quality of work
and technical efficiency through quality assurance strategies and mechanisms, including built-in
accountability mechanisms at all levels of services, accreditation, regulation of access to practice, and
surveillance of practice by professional councils. Personnel administration will be strengthened through
the establishment of working conditions that are conducive to the achievement of sectoral objectives,
including establishment of suitable job descriptions and work routines, equitable postings and transfers,
supportive supervision, transparent performance appraisals, and suitable incentives mechanisms.
Facility Construction and Maintenance. Under HPPP emphasis will be placed on renovation,
upgrading, repair, and maintenance of existing facilities, which are generally adequate in number,
rather than new construction. Many existing facilities need to be renovated and/or upgraded to meet
the needs and safety of clients and providers and the requirements of the client-oriented, unified
services to be provided. To provide better services to women and children, many thana health
complexes (THCs) will require remodeling and renovation to provide privacy to women and
appropriate bed ratios to accommodate expected male, female and child patient loads. Some district
and national hospitals, which will provide ESP referral services, will require renovation so as to make
them more mother and child-friendly. Hospitals will be upgraded to provide 70% of facilities for
women and children.
The Ministry will continue to utilize its Construction Management and Maintenance Unit (CMMU) to
plan and manage construction and maintenance requirements. The assistance of the Public Works
Department (PWD) will be sought as required. Cleaning and upkeep of facilities will be done either
on contract or through Force Account. The CMMU will prepare a comprehensive and detailed facility
maintenance plan, and adherence to this plan will be monitored as part of the Annual Program
Review.
The two existing facility surveys will be updated as the basis of assessing the facility needs of the
integrated service delivery system. The need for construction of new family welfare centers (FWCs),
community health clinics and other facilities such as housing for doctors at the Union level,
specialized hospitals, the need for a building in Dhaka to house the offices of the reorganized
Directorate were reviewed at appraisal. Community health clinics will be constructed and owned by
the community and their utilization reviewed. Other capital construction requirements will be
reviewed annually, and agreements will be reached at the APR in the light of available resources,
economic analyses, priorities and recurrent cost implications for each new construction. In principle,
the Bank supports construction of UHFWCs in unions where there is no such facility and of a
headquarters building in Dhaka for the reorganized Directorate. One hundred quarters will be built
for medical officers at union level as part of a pilot test of improving services and deciding whether to
create more medical officer posts at the union level.
Procurement and Logistics. Currently, two separate logistics systems function for the health and the
famiily planning programs, providing commodities to separate networks of service providers. Under
HPPP, a unified logistics management system will be developed. An in-depth systems study will first
be conducted to help design the modalities for a unified, integrated logistics system encompassing
staffing, training, storage facilities, LMIS, transport, procurement, forecasting, technical assistance,



- 29 -                                       Annex 2
Page IO of 17
etc. This will include an assessment of needs for storage facilities, taking into consideration the
existing storage facilities alt all levels; the projected increase in demand for ESP commodities over
time will, of necessity, require augmented storage facilities and management capability to optimize
availability of commodities at all levels in the integrated distribution network.
To run the newly designed logistics system using modem warehousing and inventory control
practices, basic and refresher training of more than 5,500 personnel involved in the management of
the unified logistics system will be organized through the private sector. In pursuance of efforts to
reduce system loss, instill greater accountability, and generate regular and reliable inventory
transaction data, the program will involve the private sector in conducting a continuous physical
inventory for selected high-volume and high-cost items in limited areas, two complete physical
inventories, prior to the mid-term review and the credit closing, and commodity audits every other
year. To make the logistics system more effective and efficient, the number of distribution tiers will
be reduced.
A unified logistics and procurement cell to plan and manage program procurement will be established.
This cell will ensure transparent procurement procedures including the use of standard bidding
documents and standard requests for proposals. To ensure maintenance of adequate stocks at all
levels of the distribution network, procurement of commodities from in-country and offshore sources
will be done through international bidding and procurement agencies. Appropriate steps will be taken
to build the capacity of the unified procurement unit to plan, supervise and monitor procurement
activities carried out by procurement agents. Accomplishment of the objectives of the Logistics
component will require substantial external technical assistance.
Quality Assurance. Ensuring quality of care in the provision of services is of paramount importance
for the success of the program. Under HPPP, norms and standards for the provision of care in the
public sector and by NGOs will be defined, and necessary steps to address quality of care issues at all
levels of service delivery, including appropriate managerial techniques and practices, will be adopted.
To achieve these objectives, and to develop a culture of "quality consciousness" for both public-sector
and private-sector care, a national Quality Assurance Cell for developing/ updating, disseminating,
and supporting quality standalrds for public-sector and private-sector services will be established.
Associated national and divisional level Quality Assurance Teams, development and/or adaptation of
quality management protocols for national, district, thana, union and field-level services, and the
establishment and support of in-built quality-assurance mechanisms at each of these levels will also be
required. Facility and provider-focused initiatives for quality assurance will be complemented by
client surveys that cover quality of care issues.
Research. Research will play a key role in the planning and implementation of HPPP, especially in
the successful development and delivery of an essential service package (ESP), and support for
research capacity will be strengthened accordingly. Research results will serve to guide policy
development, program priorities, and improvement of service delivery; they will also be essential to
monitoring program achievements and assessing program impact. Types of research that will be
needed include demographic, epidemiological, health systems, behavioral, operational, clinical, and
policy research.
Institutes that currently carry out research are not suitably developed and need strengthening. At
present, program research efforts are to an unacceptable extent characterized by duplication,
inappropriate prioritization andi inadequate dissemination. Priority program areas will be identified on
the basis of the HPSS, including maternal health, STD/AIDS and other aspects of reproductive health,
quality of care, and improvement of program efficiency and effectiveness. Failure to utilize research
results, another identified research issue, will be addressed by involving those responsible for
concerned policy or implementation areas in the design, progress and results of the research from the



30 -                                     Annex 2
Page 11 of 17
initial stages onward. Coordination of research will be done through a Research Coordination
Committee (RCC).
BMRC will continue to support medical/clinical and health systems research undertaken primarily by
researchers at medical colleges, post-graduate medical institutes and other health related institutions,
dissemination of research findings, and training in research methods. NIPORT will continue to carry
out training-related studies and seminars on research associated with specific topics of program
interest and will also undertake periodic surveys, rapid appraisal and other studies. BIRPERHT will
conduct research related to clinical aspects of reproductive health and IEDCR on epidemiology and
disease control. In addition to research institutions linked to government, the program will utilize as
appropriate the substantial research capacity of high quality in both the NGO and private-for-profit
sectors available in Bangladesh. The sector program management cell will have wide-ranging
research needs, which are expected to be met by both government institutions and the private sector.
f.     Private Sector
NGOs play a significant role in the provision of health and family welfare services; currently, over
500 NGOs are working in the health, population and nutrition sectors in some 330 out of 489 thanas.
Under HPPP, MOHFW will expand utilization of NGOs to provide health and family welfare
services, including those in the field of HIV/AIDS in selected areas. In some cases, NGOs are the
sole providers of field-level services; in others, NGOs support and complement services provided by
the government program. The NGO role in service delivery will be strengthened in the first instance
through the parallel USAID-funded National Integrated Health and Family Planning Project, which
channels assistance entirely through NGOs. The Bangladesh Population and Health Consortium, the
NGO funding mechanism established under the IDA-assisted Fourth Population and Health Project,
has proved to be effective and will be expanded under HPPP. NGOs are also expected to take on
additional activities, in particular to facilitate community involvement in the functioning and
monitoring of health facilities and in dissemination of a Patient's Charter of Rights. Supply of family
planning commodities and oral rehydration packets for social marketing purposes will continue to be
supported. The inclusion of additional supplies in the program will also be explored.
The role of the private-for-profit sector in the Government's strategy has not been fully defined. The
sector is extremely diverse, ranging from traditional practitioners in rural areas to sophisticated
facilities in Dhaka, and accounts for approximately 50 percent of total sector expenditures.
Government's first priority is to establish an appropriate regulatory framework, which is currently
lacking. A program under social marketing auspices to improve knowledge and skills of private
practitioners in the provision of temporary contraceptive methods that has worked well in other
countries is under consideration.
2.     Program Organization and Management/Sector Reform
a. Restructuring and Rationalization of MOHFW (US$3.55 Million)
A major focus of sector reform is a long-overdue restructuring of MOHFW. Key objectives are to
eliminate the split in service delivery between the Family Planning and Health Directorates and to
rationalize the organization of the Secretariat and Directorates and the division of labor between them.
Discrepancies in the system in terms of job descriptions, pay, benefits, etc. will be rectified.
Restructuring of services at thana-level and below start at the beginning of the project, initially with
50 thanas. Timing of other aspects of the restructuring and identification of transitional measures will
be reflected in each annual operational plan.



- 31 -                                      Annex 2
Page 12 of 17
Unification of Service Delivery at Thana Level and Below. The new service delivery structure will
come under a unified command from community level up to thana level. At field level, domiciliary
services will be reduced and clients will be encouraged to obtain services from a fixed facility
providing "one-stop shopping". The current designations, job descriptions and job allocations of
existing Health Assistants and Family Welfare Assistants will be revised and replaced by a single
comprehensive designation and job description, and job allocations will be revised and rationalized
accordingly.
The satellite clinics now run by family planning staff and the immunization centers run by health staff
will be merged so that all services will be available from a single point. In addition, other ESP
services for the care of women and children will also be provided from the merged center. Where
community clinics are developed, they will replace satellite clinics.
At union level all fixed facilities will be designated Union Health and Family Welfare Centers
(UHFWCs) and will provide the same mix of ESP services, rather than the present emphasis on either
health or family planning services. UHFWCs will be managed by a Thana Medical Officer or
Medical Assistant. As at field level, all designations, job descriptions and job allocations will be
revised and rationalized keeping in mind the need to provide services at the UHFWC as well as
support for satellite clinics, community clinics, and field-level services. At this level, an appropriate
gender balance in staffing will be given particular emphasis in view of the need for female staff to
provide ESP services.
The thana, as the apex of the field delivery framework, is a major focus of the restructuring. Planning
and coordination of all activities relating to ESP will be under the management of a thana-level
Manager.
The Thana Manager may be drawn from either the current Health or Family Planning sides. A job
description and qualifications will be developed for the position as well as a compensation package
that matches duties and responsibilities, including provision for a non-practicing allowance for
doctors. The Thana Manager will be the drawing and disbursing officer for all thana-level and below
requirements. His/her financial authority will be enhanced to eliminate unnecessary operational
constraints.
At district level, a District Management Committee (DMC) will be constituted under the joint
chairmanship of the Civil Surgeon and the Deputy Director Family Planning. The functions of the
DMC will be to oversee the activities of the restructured field-level delivery framework as well as
capacity building at the district level.
Restructuring of the MOH]FW Secretariat. Restructuring of the Secretariat will facilitate effective
sector-wide management of the program. The roles of the Secretariat will continue to be policy
formulation, strategic planning, evaluation of the execution of plans, legislation, assistance to
ministers, senior level personnel management, control of drugs, and liaison with professional bodies.
The Secretariat will be restructured to focus on these roles and to facilitate its policy formulation and
review role. This will not necessitate a major change in the size of the Secretariat, which will retain
its senior level posts. However, a reallocation of responsibilities will help the Secretariat to carry out
its intended responsibilities. The roles of the seven joint secretaries are expected to be: policy
formulation and review; planning and budget coordination; financial management; performance
monitoring and evaluation; development program processing and implementation; intersectoral
collaboration and gender issues; and regulation. The structural changes will be supported by



32 -                                    Annex 2
Page 13 of 17
acquisition of appropriate skills through training. An external consultancy will work with the
Secretary and senior secretariat staff to develop a final model.
Rationalization of Directorates. The current subdivision into four Directorates (Family Planning,
Health Services, NIPORT, and Nursing) is not helpful for sector-wide management of the program or
for effective and efficient delivery of a package of essential services and therefore will be redesigned
over the life of the project. The central level roles will become standard setting, monitoring and
performance review; reviewing and agreeing on detailed plans, service agreements and budgets for
operational units; human resource planning and development; support to districts and hospitals in their
planning and management; and overseeing major capital projects. The restructuring is not intended to
be a move for centralization since decentralization to lower political/geographical levels and
development of hospital autonomy are anticipated at the same time.
Decentralization. To promote more responsiveness and accountability to clients on the part of
providers, and to give them more control of planning and use of resources, a decentralization pilot will
be undertaken in one district and all its thanas. Managerial and financial autonomy will be provided.
A provider-purchaser agreement between MOHFW and the district, based on outputs and outcomes,
will be negotiated. The pilot will be undertaken with technical and financial assistance from the
European Union and will be implemented in conjunction with the Thana Functional Improvement
Project supported by the EU. It will link into the national intent to create decentralized local
government authorities.
RIBEC Initiative for Rationalization of Budgeting and Expenditure. The Ministry of Finance is
providing assistance to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare through the Initiative for
Rationalization of Budgeting and Expenditure (RIBEC 2b). The MOHFW is the pilot line ministry
for RIBEC-developed financial information systems that will be implemented by all line ministries in
the future. The financial information system developed by RIBEC will allow for: (i) better financial
communication between the Ministries of Finance and Health and Farnily Welfare; (ii) financial
management tools for the ministry to support the sector-wide management effort; and (iii) formatted
financial information for improved disbursement of funds from development partners and an effective
annual review. The Ministry of Finance is also providing a trained Chief Accounts Officer and a
deputy Chief Accounts Officer to head the Management Accounting Unit at the MOHFW. Technical
assistance will be provided to the MOHFW to support the MAU after the RIBEC project closes in the
MOHFW, Dec 31 1998.
b.     Sector Program Management (US$19.98 million)
Overview. Government will introduce a sector-wide approach to managing the health and population
sector in place of the current multitude of separate projects, each with its own funding, management,
implementation and reporting arrangements. Key features are:
*  the clear sector policy and strategic framework provided by HPSS;
* clear links between sector strategies and expenditure plans, so that the allocation of resources
reflects the strategies;
* arnual operational plans specifying the activities to be carried out under each strategy;
* annual program reviews to assess progress and plan the activities for the coming year in the light
of experience and current circumstances;
* integrated management of activities under line managers rather than through separate projects;
* performance monitoring and reporting for the operational plan rather than for separate projects;
* funding of the operational plan from a single resource pool to the extent possible.



Annex 2
-3 33.-                                 Page 14 of 17
The advantages of this approach include: implementation can be streamlined and duplication
minimized; accountability can be strengthened through linking of resources and results; greater
flexibility can be achieved in the deployment of resources.
Initially, some donors will continue to provide support in kind (TA, commodities, equipment) or in the
form of earmarked grants or loans for specified activities or budget items, and some will pool finance
using a time-slice mechanism. Eventually, however, it is envisaged that as the Government gains
experience with sector-wide management, an increasing share of external support will be provided
through pooled funding and common procedures.
Annual Operational Plans. The annual operational plan will set out the allocation of resources and
the activities to be undertaken for the sector. Annual budgets will include both capital and recurrent
expenditures and will reflect funding from all sources, including GOB revenue, GOB development,
development partner pool funding and other development partner support. Initially, the plan will be
organized in terms of the miajor programs of the sector--primary health care/family planning,
hospitals, infectious diseases, support services, etc. With time, as services are decentralized and
restructured, each district and thana could be expected to produce their own plans for using the
resources available to them, with resources allocated according to the populations they serve..
Annual Performance Reviews. Annual performance reviews (APR) will be carried out jointly by
GOB and development partners to review the progress of the program and agree on program activities
and external support for the following year. It is intended that a combined APR will replace
supervision missions and reviews by individual development partners. Specifically, GOB and
development partners will utilize the APR to:
*  review the previous year's performance and achievements against plans and expected outputs;
*  review the use of external funding against agreed plans;
*  review the findings of available studies and evaluations and their implications for program
organization and implementation;
*  identify implementation problems and bottlenecks and agree on measures needed to address them;
agree on program activities and funding levels for the coming year.
In order to accomplish these objectives, the following types of information will need to be available
for the APR.
*  a program report giving performance against planned activities and outputs based on
implementation and achievements of major activities, agreed performance indicators, and
explanations for difficulties, gaps or delays;
*  a financial report giving expenditure by program and source and reviewing the functioning of the
financial management system;
*  a management report reviiewing key management issues including progress in the development of
sector-wide management;
*  financial and activities proposals for the following year.
Management Capacity Development. The introduction of sector-wide management and the parallel
restructuring and decentralization of service delivery will require enhanced capacity at the center and
changes in the roles of program managers. At the central level, responsibilities for policy formulation,
regulation, standard setting and performance monitoring will be expanded. The Minister is the Chief
Executive and the Secretary is the Administrative head of the MOHFW. as such the overall
management of the HPSP will be their responsibility. They will have the functional assistance of four
units: the Planning and Monitoring Unit; the Policy and Research Unit; the Regulation Section and the
Finance and Administration Section. The planning and Monitoring unit, under the Joint Chief



- 34 -                                      Annex 2
Page 15 of 17
Planning will be assisted by a new Cell - the Program and Co-ordination Cell. This cell will replace
the Program Preparation Cell (PPC) and will be responsible for dealing with development partners for
the sector and supporting the planning wing of the MOHFW, especially with the quarterly monitoring
of the program and preparing the reports needed for the Annual Program Reviews. At the thana and
district levels, responsibilities for planning activities and managing funds and staff for both field-level
facilities and hospitals will be expanded. These changes will require training for strengthening of
appropriate management and administrative skills at different levels.
c. Health Policy Reform (US$7.0 million)
National Drug Policy. A review and update of Bangladesh's National Drug Policy is under
consideration by the Government, and will be undertaken as soon as the present legal bar to such work
has been lifted. Support under HPPP will be for: (i) operational support to a committee that would
review, revise and update the National Drug Policy; (ii) surveys on the current availability and
affordability of essential drugs; (iii) the development of strengthened systems for the assessment of
drug safety and monitoring of adverse drug reactions; (iv) support of more broadly-based measures
for rational use of drugs, e.g., through orientation and training of prescribers, pharmacists and other
drug sellers and through provision of drug information to the prescribers and the general public; and
(v) the publication of a national formulary of drugs.
Sustainablity. The public/private-sector mix of both the provision and the financing of services
will be reviewed annually with a view to improving the financial sustainability of the programs. This
will be primarily achieved through the development and adoption of appropriate sectoral policies and
regulatory action. The Annual Program Review will also focus on input-mix sustainablity by
analyzing allocations to capital and recurrent expenditures and within recurrent expenditures, by
analyzing salary and non-salary expenditures. On capital expenditures, the analysis will explore
proportions of capital to recurrent expenditure for the year as well as long term recurrent cost
implications of investments. On non-salary recurrent expenditure analysis, a balance will be
maintained to ensure that the quality of care will not suffer from shortages in resources for drugs,
contraceptives or maintenance of facilities. Moreover, domestic resources allocated to non-salary
recurrent expenditures will be increased to minimize donor dependence and increase sustainability.
Cost Recovery and Health Insurance. In view of the potential resource gap between the sectoral
resource envelope and projected sectoral expenditures, MOHFW will endeavor to expand cost
recovery for public-sector services and will implement pilots in order to facilitate the adoption of a
revised national policy on revenue generation and retention by public-sector facilities. In line with
agreed HPSS principles, this would take into account the public's willingness and ability to pay. The
pilots will link revenue generation through user fees to retention of revenue at participating facilities
and to quality improvements. Pilot cost recovery schemes will help in understanding avenues to
generate funds locally, with exemptions for vulnerable groups. Health insurance schemes are an
alternative approach for financing health care. In the case of social health insurance, not-for-profit
providers will combine this with provision of subsidized health care. In Bangladesh, considerable
experience already exists with the provision of social health insurance by NGOs and community
hospitals. Total coverage of such schemes has, however, remained limited. HPPP will therefore
support further pilots with social health insurance in rural Bangladesh, with a view towards increased
sustainable coverage with quality services. Urban health insurance coverage is proposed, through
development of a health insurance scheme for government employees and for employees of state-
owned enterprises.

Public/Private Mix of Service Provision will be addressed through regulatory action and franchising
of high-quality private sector care. The contribution of the private sector to the provision of health
care services in Bangladesh has progressively increased during last 15 years. This has improved
access to medical care, especially in the urban areas. The 1982 Private Clinic & Laboratory Act
provided some guidelines ifor regulating the private sector. In addition to MOHFW's regulations,
other regulations also impact on the private health sector. Some of these are: trade licensing
procedures, taxation systerns, regulation of recruitment of manpower and staff development, access to
bank credit, procedures for utility connections, procurement of equipment & supplies and adopting
medical ethics. The status of implementation and enforcement of these rules and regulations will be
reviewed and updated.
MOHFW will also explore the provision of high-quality care through "franchising" of selected and
specially trained private-sector providers who commit to adhere to agreed quality of care standards
and to publicize fee schedules that are affordable to low-income groups.
Adoption of a Patients' Charter of Rights will complement quality-of-care improvements from a
professional and technical perspective. The aim of such a charter will be to raise the awareness of
clients of their rights to quality of care, including such aspects as privacy, informed choice, safety and
efficacy of care, as well as provision of free-of charge care or adherence to approved fee schedules.
Clients will be advised of their related rights through NGO action as well as the media; clients'
awareness as well as provider adherence will be monitored.
Gender Issues. HPPP will expand the effort begun in the previous IDA-supported Fourth Project to
address gender issues in the sector and support the development of a gender strategy. Gender issues
are addressed across all project components. In general terms, the project gives priority to a package
of essential services (ESP). The primary beneficiaries will be rural women and their young children.
ESP expands the long-standing emphasis on family planning to encompass other aspects of
reproductive health care for women and includes a major effort to reduce the high rates of maternal
mortality and morbidity in B3angladesh. Refurbishing and upgrading of hospitals will include
provision for adjusting the number of beds for women to correspond to the need for care and for
privacy as well as for separate toilet facilities for female patients. Human resource development
strategies will incorporate a gender focus; agreed policy objectives include increasing the number of
female supervisors, managers and doctors. HRD statistics will provide gender-disaggregated data on
staffing, training, and other key HRD functions. Similarly, the statistics provided by the management
information systems will include gender breakdowns of vital rates, service delivery coverage and
other data. Behavior change communication programs will emphasize the importance of reaching
female clients and female service providers. Surveys of service delivery coverage and client
experience will disaggregate results by gender. To bring these elements together, the progress of the
program in reaching female clients and addressing gender issues will be specifically reviewed as part
of the Annual Program Review.
Participation Issues. Stakeholder participation in projectVprogram design and preparation was
substantial and will have a key role in project/program implementation as well. Stakeholder
consultations with all three categories of stakeholders (clients, providers, and external groups) will
continue throughout the project period. Community groups will be organized at local and thana levels
to monitor the performance of providers and the functioning of health facilities. Community
participation in the managernent of the health system would also be facilitated by expected
decentralization of governmental authority to locally elected bodies. Client and provider surveys will
be carried out on a systematic basis to provide feedback concerning client contact with service
providers in terms of coverage and quality as well as provider attitudes, concerns, and perceptions of
program efforts to promote client-focused services. The APR will draw on all of these sources to

Page 17 of 17
assess progress in meeting stakeholder concerns and will also review proposals for the coming year to
strengthen the program's ability to move in the desired directions.
Environmental Issues. Bangladesh faces fundamental ecological insecurities which, combined with
high population density, generate ever increasing environmental pressures that make the country's
situation among the world's most difficult. HPPP will continue support provided under the previous
IDA-supported health and population projects to sustain the substantial fertility decline achieved by
Bangladesh over the last two decades; other intersectoral activities that will also contribute to a
decline in population growth rates will be coordinated by MOHFW.
An issue with important environmental implications that will be addressed by MOHFW with HPPP
support is the management of medical wastes. At present, there is little if any provision for medical
waste management in government hospitals and clinics. Government will therefore proceed to
address the issue in three stages by carrying out two studies and developing an action plan, as follows.
1.   By June 30, 1999, complete a diagnostic study to identify sources, types, and quantities of
wastes generated by all types of medical facilities, both rural and urban, as well as present
practices for dealing with them. The study can probably be carried out on the basis of a sample
cf typical facilities at union, thana and district levels as well as covering hospital and other
facilities in Dhaka and Chittagong.
2.   A second, follow-up study to examine three areas: (i) the technical options available for
mnanagement of the types of wastes found; (ii) the existing regulatory framework through which
Government can mandate the waste management practices utilized by private sector
institutions; and (iii) institutional requirements for management and implementation of a
medical waste management program. The study would make recommendations in all three
areas, including specific measures to manage wastes generated by the different types of
facilities.
3.   By December 31, 1999, prepare a national comprehensive, phased action plan based on the
study results; the action plan will be reviewed at the March/April 2000 annual review.
All three phases will utilize external technical experts, who will work with national counterparts and
organizations. The draft action plan will be discussed with IDA and other development partners, and
implementation of the plan will begin as soon as it is agreed. It is anticipated that while substantial
progress can be made within the project period, a longer period of time will be required for
completion of the entire plan.

IDA proposes to support Bangladesh Health and Population Program over the five year period from
July 1, 1998 to June 20, 2003. The total projected cost of the program is equivalent to US$2.9 billion
in current prices. This will cover the minimum agreed program of delivering expanded and improved
health services nationwide over this period including both recurrent and capital costs. I Costs were
estimated in 1997/98 prices and translated into current prices, using IDA projections of local inflation
and US dollar/Taka exchange rates. No separate provisions were made for price contingencies.
1 Costs Estimates used in this Appraisal document are based on the Project Implementation Plan. They were
discussed with the Government during appraisal and deemed to be adequate, although, in keeping with the
framework's emphasis on annual agreements, IDA appraised only the 1998/99 program in detail.

Bangladesh: Health and Population Program Project
Economic Analysis Summary
1.     Introduction2
HPPP is designed to support the Government of Bangladesh's entire program for the health and population
sector totaling US$2.9 billion over the period 1998/99 - 2003/04. Specifically the project will support (i)
reforming the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in order to improve efficiency and (ii) earmarking a
large share (60-70 percent) of the publicly financed sector budget to an essential services package of cost-
effective health and population interventions improving both efficiency and equity of resource use. This
Annex highlights findings of economic, financial, and project analyses relating to questions of framework,
choices, and impact3.
II.    Framework Questions
A.     Linkages to Country Assistance Strategy and Economic and Sector Work
The design of HPPP follows directly from the Bangladesh Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) as well as
Economic and Sector Work specific to Bangladesh, such as the Health and Population Sector Strategy (HPSS),
and general sector work such as the World Development Report 93 (WDR 93) and the Health, Nutrition, and
Population Sector Strategy Paper 97 (HNP SSP).
HPPP and the CAS: The Bangladesh CAS highlights fostering Human Development (health, population and
education) as one of four components of IDA's assistance strategy. Within the social sectors, the CAS
identifies a move from projectized approach to a sector approach for social sector programs as a means for
achieving improvements in quality, efficiency, cost effectiveness, and coverage of basic services. Table A4.1
summarizes sector-specific elements of the development agenda developed in the CAS. The design of HPPP
addressed all the sectoral elements highlighted in the CAS. Specifically, HPPP (i) increases the efficiency and
cost-effectiveness of sectoral expenditures, (ii) sets and protects the intra-sectoral funding priority for basic
services, (iii) develops government capacities, (iv) improves quality of services, (v) enhances reproductive
health services in order to reduce maternal mortality, (vi) involves stakeholders in the design, monitoring and
implementation, (vii) strengthens Government capacity., and (viii) develops a flexible program approach to
assistance.
HPPP and HPSS: The HPSS was produced by the Government of Bangladesh's MOHFW and its
development partners, including the World Bank, in order to provide a vision and a policy framework for
HPPP. HFPPP represents a translation of HPSS into an expenditure and reform plan. The development of a
Logical Framework for HPPP used HPSS as it's starting point.

Table A4. 1: Health and Population Sector-specific Development Agenda in Bangladesh CAS
Country Objectives                         Development Agenda
Improve quality efficiency,  -Build on successes by focusing on implementation, sectoral
cost-effectiveness, and     efficiency, cost-effectiveness; set intra-sectoral funding priorities;
coverage of basic services in    develop Government capacity to assess progran affordability,
population/health.          financial sustainability, and set priorities.
-Reaffirm emphasis on basic services and expand female coverage of
programs; improve quality of basic health care, enhance
reproductive health and reduce maternal mortality
-Develop clear strategy for targeted service expansion using NGOs
-Enhance local participation to help endure better quality of
population and health services.
-Strengthen Government capacity for aid coordination and promote a
flexible program approach to donor funding.
HPPP and WDR93: WDR93 articulated World Bank policy in the health sector by recommending that
governments ensure the finance and delivery of an essential package of cost-effective services consistent with
public finance criteria. HPPP's ESP is a subset of the WDR93's Essential Package of Services taking into
account the morbidity and mortality situation of the country and the financial constraints faced.
HPPP and HNP SSP: The HNP SSP describes the objectives of HNP work at the World Bank as (i) improve
the health, nutrition, and population outcomes of the poor; (ii) enhance the performance of health care systems;
and (iii) secure sustainable health care financing. HPPP is designed to achieve the first two objective and
provides some building blocks for the third objective. The HNP outcomes of the poor in Bangladesh are the
main focus of HPPP and the pro-poor focus and gender balanced manner the ESP was defined, funded, and
delivered will help achieve these outcomes (see section IV A of this Annex). Improving system performance
will be achieved by reorganizing the main structures and increasing autonomy to the hospital sector and
decentralization of authority. Piloting cost-recovery and health insurance schemes will provide building
blocks for long-term financial sustainability.
B.     Sector Environment
IDA's involvement in the Health and Population Sector in Bangladesh since 1975 has seen a gradual evolution
of the sector. Exanples of positive changes include a stronger financial commitment to the sector, an
emphasis on primary health, and an innovative and effective population programn. The impressive results of
these and other changes are documented elsewhere in this document. It is important to acknowledge, however,
that the sector can still be more effective if key distortions are addressed. Several assessments4 of the sector
and of the on-going Fourth Population and Health Project (FPHP) have identified three key distortions: (i) the
current organization and management structure of the Ministry of Health and Family, (ii) the historic reliance
on a projectized approach to development work, and (iii) over centralization. HPPP directly addresses these
three areas:
Reorganization. The Health and Population Sector Strategy identified the bifurcated structure of the MOHFW
as a systemic issue requiring reform. The bifurcated structure of Population and Health wings with separate
cadres at all levels does not adequately respond to the needs of maternal health and clinical contraception and
limits the potential for increasing effective services. To address this issue, the Government established a High-
4 " FPHP Mid-Term Review"; "Lessons learned from the current and past IDA-Cofinanciers funded Population and
Health Projects"; "Bangladesh The Determinants of Reproductive Change"; and " Meeting Report--GOB and donor
consultation for the future population and health program Sept. 1995". OED reports: "The World Bank and Bangladesh's
Population Program" June 28, 1991, and "Population and the World Bank, Implications from Eight Case Studies"

level Committee on Organization and Management (HLCOM). The HLCOM recommended, and the
Government agreed, that reorganization take place in two phases: (i) complete reunification of the present
outreach, Union and Thana-level health and family planning structure under a single command of the proposed
Thana-level chief/manager, and (ii) restructuring of the Directorates, Divisional and District levels after a
period of 2-3 years. A phased introduction of the reorganization was assessed as being more likely to succeed
than functional unification under the present structure or a once-for-all reunification. HPPP will support the
capacity building needed to implement the reorganization.
Building capacity for sector-wide management. The historic reliance on projects for implementing
development projects produced a management culture inconsistent with sector-wide management. A
management capacity assessment5 recommended a number of actions to improve capacity (management
training, better support systems for line managers, restructuring of high-level management functions). The
Project Implementation Plan includes a plan for implementing a phased strategy for developing sector-wide
management capacity under HPPP, beginning with the establishment of a change management unit to guide
key steps that need to be taken during the transition from the FPHP to HPPP.
Table A4.2: Management Capacity Assessment Recommendations
Issue                                  Recommended Steps
1. Implement Management        -Reorganize following HLCOM recommendations.
Reforms                        -Decentralize management to hospitals and thanas
-Restructure the Secretariat
-Restructure the Directorates as decentralization proceeds
-Strengthen management skills at all levels
2. Move From Project to Program   -Reduce number of projects and place under line management
Approach                      -Agree to broad allocation for each program
-Prepare annual plans for each program (with costs and sources of
finance)
-Apply standard planning and reporting procedures even for parallel
funded projects
3. Develop Supporting          -Financial information systems with cost centers related to identified
Management and Information     programs
Systems                        -Strengthen performance information and monitoring capacity
-Improve human resource management systems
Decentralization. Under the Fourth Population and Health Project, the Thana Ftnctional Improvement Pilot
Project (TFIPP) is already focusing on this objective, and a pilot project is now planned for six TFIPP thanas
to pilot decentralization approaches during HPPP. This will enhance local management capacity in a way that
could be expanded to national scale in tandem with the roll-out of Bangladesh's proposed Local Government
Initiative (LGI). Linking decentralization of the sector to the LGI is likely to be key to effective expansion of
pilot results. The HLCOM has also proposed a further refinement of its reorganization plan that could be
initiated once the decentralization process gets underway.
Finally, in assessing the design of HPPP as it relates to the sector environment, attention was given to the
concern that the project would be used to simply substitute for real structural change. The design addressed
this impottant issue by linking clearly defined reform milestones to financial disbursement. The financing
plan for HPPP includes two mechanisms for adjusting development partner funding annually which are
triggered by system performance as well as reform pace and direction. The first mechanism governs the
amount and type of expenditures reimbursed against. The second mechanism governs the percentage of the
financial support held in reserve until reform milestones are achieved.

C.      Public Sector Justification
Public sector justification for investments can be addressed at different levels. Given the social and economic
conditions of a country, it is important to analyze the justification for investments in health and population
relative to other sectors. Within the sector, it is also important to ensure that public funds are spent on
economically justified investments and address important social objectives. The Country Assistance Strategy
for Bangladesh presents the case for investments in the health and population sector in Bangladesh6.
Since HPPP supports the whole health and population sector, it was important to take a critical look at the
justifications for public finance and the delivery arrangements. Service delivery activities can be grouped into
two categories: (i) Essential Services Package (ESP), and (ii) hospital services (mostly hospital services and
some public health activities). In analyzing justifications for state financing, market failures due to public
goods7 or externalities8 were analyses and the role of the state in addressing poverty was considered9.
Moreover, consideration was given to correcting for gender inequalities, and recognizing political, strategicl°,
and practical arguments. Attention was given to the cost-effectiveness of services provided.
The list of services in ESP is a subset of the package of services identified in the World Development Report
93: Investing in Health. Publicly financing these interventions is justified in terms of strong elements of a
public good or clear positive externalities. Furthermore, these services target diseases associated with the
poorest in Bangladesh and are delivered at facilities that are more likely to serve the poor. A number of the
services address historic gender inequalities in access to services. Population interventions in ESP address
both the unmet needs of parents trying to reduce family size and the educational elements of reducing desired
family size. Externalities of population growth in terms of environmental impact and income distribution
impact are well documentedl 1. Table A4.3 summarizes the characteristics of the four components of ESP.
Turning next to hospital services, the economic justification for public financing or provision is considerably
less clear than for ESP. A theoretical argument can be made for justifying hospital as a social insurance
system covering the poor and vulnerable especially as that relates to catastrophic illnesses. Economic analysis
highlighted below, however, shows the hospital sector to be income-regressive. But even if the economic
arguments are weak, there are political, strategic, and practical arguments for not completely abandoning the
hospital sector. Hospitals are the most visible component of the health sector and, therefore, have strong
political support. Strategically, by having HPPP address the whole sector, the development partners are
addressing the issue of fund fungibility in the sector and leveraging resources to protect funding for priority
services (see section III in this Annex). Practical arguments for public sector delivery of such services revolve
around the weak infrastructure for the private sector to deliver health services, especially in rural areas, and a
developing but weak regulatory framework.
6 J. Hammer in "Economic Analysis for Health Projects," presents the guidelines for a rationale for public investments in
health. He finds the health sector to be on firmer ground than many other sectors when looking at market failures.
7 Public good refer to goods and services that are non-rival and non-exclusionary.
8 Externalities refer to costs or benefits that accrue to society and not just the decision-maker.
9 P. Musgrove in "Public and Private Roles in Health: Theory and Financing Patterns," presents ajustification
framework for state intervention in the health care market based on economic theory. He lists three arguments: (1) assure
optimal production of a public good; (2) correct or offset failings in the market of health insurance; or (3) subsidize
consumption too the poor.
10 Strategic arguments dealt with the choices made in the HPPP financing plan in order to address funds fungibility
issues. Hammer, "Economic Analysis for Health Projects," 1996.

III.    Project (Program) Choice
HPPP is a sector-wide program project focusing on increasing spending on basic services and reforming the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Consideration was given to two questions in analyzing alternatives to
HPPP: what would happen if the IDA did not assist in developing and funding HPPP? and are there better
ways to achieve the desired development objectives. Answers to the first question are summarized in section
D5 of the PAD.
Alternatives considered to a program approach included a more traditional projectized approach along the lines
of the Fourth Population and Health Project (FPHP), targeted interventions in primary and maternal health,
targeted interventions in the hospital sector, primary emphasis on private delivery, and primary focus on
developing insurance systems. It should be noted that given some of the attractive features of the last two
alternatives, HPPP includes pilots and interventions that will develop needed capabilities and build ownership.
Traditional projectized approach. While a traditional projectized approach such as the fourth project can better
focus attention on specific issues through vertical management, it has a number of drawbacks especially given
the size and complexity of the sector and external assistance in Bangladesh. Compared to a sector-wide
approach, a projectized approach: (i) does not address institutional capacity building adequately, and in some
respects, conflicts with sector management, (ii) provides less flexibility for reallocation of resources if projects
fail or priorities change, (iii) does not leverage sector resources to ensure a sizable share for priority preventive
and cost-effective services, (iv) does not address the resource fungibility issue within sector, (v) provides a
weaker framework for rationalization of sector spending, and (vi) weakens donor coordination.
Targeted interventions in primary and maternal health. The obvious advantage of this type of approach is the
knowledge that all IDA resources go to priority services. However, there is then no guarantee that IDA funds
are not simply substituting for GOB funds that can then be used for less desirable services within or outside the

sector (fungibility). A related issue is the created dependence on external funds for essential services (donor
and lender trap).
Targeted investments in hospital sector. While the hospital sector in Bangladesh needs assistance in order to
improve efficiency, accountability, management, and equity, a targeted investment on hospital alone would be
difficult to justify. Benefit incidence analysis of public subsidies in the health sector show the hospital sub-
sector to be the most regressive. Furthermore, there is limited economic justification for public finance.
Primary focus on delivery of services by the private sector (for- and not-for-profit). While the long term vision
for the health and population sector in Bangladesh includes substantial roles of all segments of the private
sector in care and commodities delivery, there is currently limited physical and human infrastructure for rural
health services delivery outside the public sector. Another constrained faced by this approach is limited
government ownership due to the resulting civil service layoffs that could further destabilize the political
situation. It should be noted that given the attractive features of this approach, HPPP will invest in developing
regulatory framework and does include some private sector (NGO) delivery.
Major focus on insurance for health finance. Given the limited resource envelope for the health sector and
research findings on the economic impact of catastrophic illnesses to income generating members of poor
families, strengthening insurance systems is an attractive approach. The limited experience in Bangladesh
with such systems, coupled with a weak regulatory environment, limits it feasibility in the short and medium
term. In order to address this issue in the lone-term, HPPP will develop and pilot rural and urban insurance
schemes and invest in capacity building.
IV.    Impact
A.     Distributional Impact (including poverty impact). Public spending should promote efficiency, by
correcting for various market failures, and equity, by improving the distribution of economic welfare. In most
developing countries, the lack of alternative policy instruments increases the reliance on spending for
redistribution. For example, tax systems in poor countries are much less useful (than high-income countries)
for redistribution, making it vital to highlight the role of redistribution in public spending12.
The Government of Bangladesh recognizes the important role of public spending in addressing equity. With
respect to income inequality, the GOB's poverty alleviation strategy is based on three approaches: (i) increase
economic growth through development of infrastructure and growth oriented programs, (ii) raise the capacity
of the poor through increase social sector allocations (education and health), and (iii) public safety net schemes
to mitigate the severity of poverty. Increasing spending on health and population through HPPP fits well with
the GOB's overall poverty strategy.
Simply increasing public spending in these sectors, however, is not sufficient for achieving the objective of
reaching and assisting the poor and vulnerable and addressing gender inequality. It is important to structure
public spending and to build incentives in order to better target public subsidies. The design of HPPP took
into account research and economic analysis findings regarding existing inequalities in the sector.
Benefit incidence analysis was performed to identify winners and losers in the current, pre-reform, system.
The poorest and least educated member of society, rural residents, and women receive less of the government
subsidy than other groups. Table A4.4 highlights one aspect of the public subsidy inequalities13. Comparing
the use of different levels of pulblic care delivery facilities by income groups shows the richest 20 percent of
the Bangladeshi society much nnore likely to use a hospital--the most expensive level of care--than the poorest.

Service utilization at Thana Health Complexes and Union level facilities, however, tends to favor the poorer
segments. T'he results are similar by residence. While rural residence represent 82 percent of the population
they account for only 65 percent of hospital visits. The inequity in subsidies is even stronger when admissions
to inpatient care versus outpatient care are considered. Figure A4. 1 shows patients from the richest quintile
more than five times as likely to be admitted for inpatient--expensive--care than patients from the poorest
quintile. Similarly, patients from urban areas are more than twice as likely to be admitted than rural patents
and male patients are more likely to be admitted than females.

population are more likely to use Union level and below facilities and less likely to use hospital than better off
groups, (ii) real costs of using the sector are far more important than possible cost recovery (real costs include
travel, waiting, sizable under the table payments, repeated visits), (iii) limited information available to
vulnerable groups about services available, the usefulness of services, or consumer rights and responsibilities,
and (iv) the perceived quality of care at the facilities combined with the uncertainty regarding the amount of
under-the-table payment to be faced decreased utilization at public facilities.
In designing HPPP, the goveniment and the development partners took into account factors contributing to the
current regressivity of the sector. Elements of the program designed to address equity and increase poverty
alleviation impact included: (i) an ESP design to address diseases of the poor and vulnerable (including
services to address maternal morbidity and mortality and gender specific health needs), (ii) a delivery strategy
for ESP to ensure that a sizable share of the total public budget is targeted at facilities likely to serve the poor
and vulnerable, (iii) a Behavior Change Communication strategy (BCC) to address the informational needs of
vulnerable groups and to improve treatment by providers, (iv) a qualitative and quantitative monitoring
strategy (including and annual review) that involves vulnerable groups and provides advocacy by focusing
attention on distributional issues, (v) systems to improve the quality of care (actual and perceived) at facilities
frequented by vulnerable groups, and (vi) interventions to build an infrastructure and informational base for
the development of population based resource allocation mechanism.
B.     Overall Impact (Development Impact). Improving the health and family welfare status among the
most vulnerable women, children and poor of Bangladesh through client-centered provision and client
utilization of ESP are the basic goal and purpose of HPPP. Leveraging sector resources to fund the most cost-
effective services in health and population and to reduce inefficiencies will help Bangladesh achieve its
objectives. In order to achieve the largest possible positive impact on the health and welfare of the population,
HPPP will facilitate: (i) Increasing the delivery and quality of services most likely to minimize morality and
morbidity in the country by earmarking a large share of the resources to ESP; (ii) strengthening the demand for
ESP services by providing an effective Behavior Change Communication package, involving communities
through consultations and involvement in community centers, and developing empowerment tools (bill of
rights and community oversight); (iii) building the flexibility to adjust the program annually to maximize
positive developments and examine and revise weak components.
The re-organization of the deli very approach and the increase in earmarked resources to ESP translate into
increased coverage of life-saving and improving interventions. Expected increases in coverage rates for a
subset of ESP interventions is presented in Table A4.5. A complete listing of expected coverage rates by each
disease sub-intervention and at each level of care is provided with the Government's Program documentation
(there are 23 disease specific headings, more than 80 interventions, and four levels of care delivery). HPPP
will assist the Government in dleveloping information systems to revise estimates of burden of disease and the
effectiveness of interventions allowing of better needs-based planning.
The strength of HPPP design and the flexibility of a Sector Investment Program for mid-course adjustments
improve the likelihood of achieving the expected development impact. Strong and participatory supervision,
monitoring and on-going evaluation taking advantage of built-in information systems and focusing on activity,
output, purpose and goal indicators, are important steps in this process. Developing a consensus by all
stakeholders on the sector strategy and taking advantage of existing coordination mechanism should minimize
conflicts and develop effective partnerships. Like it's predecessor project (FPHP), HPPP will achieve success
only if the health and family welfare indicators for Bangladesh's most vulnerable improve.

V.     Finance
Since HPPP supports all elements of the health and population sector in Bangladesh, financial analysis covered
the whole sector including private financing. Analysis included a public expenditure review I 6, a flow of
funds analysis1 7, assessments of resource mobilization including cost-recovery1 8, recurrent cost implications
of capital investments1 9, an assessment of the absorptive capacity for additional resources in the sector, and
an analysis of input mix. Findings for the financial analysis helped frame the issues for policy dialogue and
improved program design.
Since a key objective of HPPP is to increase the level of available resources for basic and cost-effective health
and population services, program design ensures that (i) the commitment of the Government to the sector
continues to increase, (ii) a sizable share of the overall public resources is earmarked to an Essential Services
Package made up of cost-effective services, (iii) improving the efficiency of public sector resource use, and
(iv) improving resource mobilization.
A.      Commitment: The recent history on the GOB's commitment to the social sectors is encouraging.
From 1990-95, nominal ADP expenditures on health population and education grew by 34 percent annually;
the largest of any sector. Overall, the reallocation in public spending has seen the share of health and family
planning in total public spending increase from 4.7 percent in FY86 to 6.9 percent in FY95. As a percent of
GDP, the share to the sector doubled between 1986 and 1995. HPPP will further expand the Government of

Bangladesh's commitment to lhis sector. This commitment was affirmed by the Ministry of Finance
designating the health a population sector as a priority sector and indicating that agreements on overall
spending will not adversely effect sectoral funds.
An element of the financing plan for HPPP includes an incentive for the Government to increase spending on
health and population. Disbursements for HPPP will be on a reimbursement basis for a percentage of
government expenditures agreed to annually (see Annex 6). This mechanism includes IDA funds and grant
funds from some of the development partners20.
B.      Priority to ESP: Increasing total spending to the sector achieves the objective of increasing resources
for basic and cost-effective health and population services only if spending on ESP is protected. The
Government of Bangladesh has a good record of protecting primary care and priority services. Under the
Fourth Health and Population Project, about 60 percent of total public sector funds to the sector were used for
primary care. Tables A4.6 and A4.7 detail flow of funds analysis for fiscal year 1994/95 for the whole sector
including household and NGO spending.

commitment. For the first year of HPPP, 63 percent of sectoral resources will be earmarked for ESP. Table
A4.8 provides first year allocations by type of service delivery and overhead cost centers and provides the ratio
allocated to ESP. Moreover, the choice of the lending instrument (SIP) was, in part, driven by the need to
address funcl fungibility within the sector. Under a traditional investment approach, most external funds are
used to provide priority services allowing governments to use a large share of its contributions for non-priority
services. As a result, not only would funds flow to non-priority services but priority services become highly
dependent on external assistance. Under a SIP, external funds finance the whole sector but only if funds are
protected for priority services.

C.     Efficiency: The scarcity of resources available to the sector highlight the need for efficient use of
funds. The main thrust of the reform effort in HPPP is a reorganization of the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare in order to increase the volume and quality of services provided. This will be achieved by eliminating
redundant structures and taking fuller advantage of current staffing. In addition to achieving efficiency gains
through reorganization, HPPP will build on the facility level efficiency work by the Health Economic Unit of
the MOHFW funded under the fourth project.
D.     Resource Mobilization: The last element of the financial strategy for increasing resources to priority
services is resource mobilization. There are several problems with the current systems for resource
mobilization in the sector. For cost recovery, the scale is limited and it has some basic structural problems: (i)
all resources collected are passed along to treasury (no retention or recycling), (ii) there are no mechanisms for
consumer empowerment (potential for abuse), and (iii) the mechanisms for protecting the poor are not well
developed. Rural health insurance does not exist in any large scale in the country. Some work has been done
on developing plans for formal sector health insurance but there has not been any attempt to test or implement
schemes. Cost sharing or community contributions potentially can both generate resources for the sector and
at the same time address another pressing issue of low use of primary care facilities. For cost sharing
mechanisms to work, however, issues of local governance need to be addressed. While resource mobilization
is not a major focus of HPPP, steps are being taken to improve existing systems, to pilot innovations, and to
build infrastructure.
E.     Risks: There are three potential risk elements relating to the financing plan for HPPP. First, given the
strong financial commitment of the govemment to this sector, the question is the ability to maintain this higher
level if the macroeconomic picture changes. Given the commitments of the last two governments to the social
sectors, it is likely that the fiscal commitment would be maintained. A second risk is a political drive to shift
more resource within the sector to highly visible but not-cost effective new capital investments. The
implications of such an effort persist beyond the initial capital investments by draining recurrent costs from
priority services. The annual review process of HPPP and enforcing the covenants described in Block 4 will
be used to counteract political pressures in this area. And finally, there is also the risk of political pressure to

increase the wage bill elements of the expenditure plans at the expense of non-wage recurrent costs. The
annual review process will also be used to monitor and address this issue

NOTE:
1. The five-year expenditure plans is estimated to be US$2.896 billion and represents less than
US$4.0 per capita per year in public spending on health. The needs of the sector in Bangladesh far
outweigh the availability of resources. The GOB will endeavor to mobilize additional resources from
both domestic and external sources.
2. The exchange rates used for donor currencies were based on the January 1998 period average
from the IMF International Financial Statistics.

Bangladesh: Health and Population Program Project
Procurement, Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements
PROCUREMENT
1.    The sector approach nature of HPPP, whereby IDA and other development partners will finance a part
of the government's expenditure in the health and population sectors, makes it difficult to forecast in detail, at
this stage, both the total procurement amounts for different categories of expenditures and the anticipated
amounts of financing by IDA and other development partners.
Procurement Plan
2.     On an annual basis, the government will submit by February 28 of every year to the development
partners the Annual Procurement Plan for the next FY. The Plan should include procurement that will be
implemented during the FY as well as that for which processing will be initiated. The government and the
development partners will reach agreement on the Plan, including contract packages for the Essential Service
Packages (ESP) and for non-ESP goods and works, and services, during the Annual Program Review. During
subsequent missions, the progress achieved will be reviewed, and if necessary the Plan will be revised.
Procurement Guidelines
3.     When a contract for goods or works is financed in part or in whole from IDA funds, including pooled
Trust Funds (Netherlands, Sweclen, United Kingdom), the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits, Januarv 1995 (Revised January and August 1996, and September 1997) shall apply.
This also applies to procurement that will be reimbursed under Category I of Schedule I to the Development
Credit Agreement under which IDA and other development partners will not finance any specific investment
but rather provide funds to cover part of the Government's investment expenditure. Consultants' services
financed in part or in whole from IDA funds, including pooled Trust Funds, will be procured in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January
1977, revised September 1997. Specific investments financed by other development partners will be in
accordance with the Guidelines of those development partners.
Procurement Methods (Table A)
4.     Procurement of goods and works (including related services) will be undertaken in accordance with
the following procedures.
(a)    Works: Works mostly comprise repair and maintenance of existing facilities, upgrading of existing
rural service centers, essential extensions to hospitals and construction of some new rural service facilities.
These are widely dispersed and geographically scattered all over the country, and the amount of each such
contract will be small. All works contracts with an estimated value of less than US$20,000 may be procured
through: (i) Prudent shopping with solicitation of price quotations from at least three qualified bidders eligible
under the guidelines up to an aggregate amount of US$10.0 million, or (ii) Community Participation up to an
aggregate amount of US$5.0 million. Other works contracts with an estimated value of less than US$5.0
million each are also unlikely to attract the interest of foreign bidders and therefore will be procured through
National Competitive Bidding (sCB) procedures. However, the proposed Health and Population Bhaban,
estimated to cost about US$10.0 million, and any other contracts estimated to cost US$5.0 million or more,
will be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures.



54 -                                       Annex 6
Page 2 of 9
(b)    Goods: Procurement of goods estimated to cost the equivalent of US$300,000 or more per contract
will be made through ICB. Goods estimated to cost less than US$300,000 per contract may be procured
through NCB. Specialized goods, including family planning commodities which are proprietary in nature (e.g.
Norplant), nmay be procured through Direct Contracting. Urgently required goods estimated to cost less than
US$20,000 per contract, up to US$5.0 million in aggregate, may be procured based on comparison of price
quotations obtained from at least three eligible suppliers. Procurement of small quantities of off-the-shelf
goods may be carried out from specialized agencies of the United Nations up to an aggregate amount of
US$10.0 million. Goods that are suitable for procurement through open competition but are procured from
one or more specific firms or enterprises will be considered as Reserved Procurement, and that portion of the
procurement will be not be eligible for financing under the Credit.
(c)    TechnicalAssistance: Consultants' services for architectural and engineering design and supervision,
specialized health system management, technical support services, survey and research activities, and services
of NGOs, audit firms and procurement agents, etc. shall be procured through Quality- and Cost-Based
Selection (QCBS) methods. Consultants' services estimated to cost US$100,000 or less may be procured on
the basis of fixed budget or least cost selection methods. Specialized agencies of the United Nations may be
appointed as procurement agents through a single source method under terms and conditions acceptable to
IDA for the procurement of vaccines. In addition, during the first year of project implementation, to facilitate
continuity while competitive selection procedures are put in place, specialized agencies of the United Nations
may be appointed as procurement agent on a single-source basis under terms and conditions acceptable to
IDA. Individual consultants may also be employed on assignments for which (a) the experience and
qualifications of the individual are of paramount importance, and (b) teams of personnel and additional
professional support are not required.
(d)    Training and Fellowships: Training and fellowships may be contracted through a single-source
selection method.
Procurement Responsibilities
5.     Procurement responsibilities for works, goods and services will be carried out as follows:
(a)    WDrks: Procurement of works will be carried out largely by the Construction and Maintenance
Management Unit (CMMU), the engineering unit of MOHFW, with the help of local architectural and
engineering consulting firms to be hired by MOHFW. In addition, the Public Works Department (PWD)
currently carries out maintenance of certain health facilities from the revenue budget. Until the roles of
CMMU and PWD are reviewed and revised arrangements approved by the government, they will continue
with their present responsibilities. Further, MOHFW may avail the services of the Local Government
Engineering Department (LGED), particularly for the construction of community clinics. To ensure the
quality and timeliness of the works carried out, MOHFW will appoint qualified consultants to carry out
performarice audits.
(b)    Goods: Until the existing Directorates are reorganized, the Central Medical Stores Depot (CMSD) of
the Health Services Directorate, the Director Logistics of the Family Planning Directorate, and designated
MOHFW officials will carry out all procurement of goods, with the help of consultants and/or specialists if
required. They will function under the supervision of MOHFW. Any procurement carried out at peripheral
levels will be supervised and monitored by the respective Directorates. To assist the government in procuring
medical and surgical requisites (MSR), pharmaceuticals, vaccines, medical equipment, and contraceptives,
MOHFW imay employ procurement agents (PAs), including UN agencies. Procurement carried out by
procurement agents and/or UN agencies will be in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines,



55 -                                       Annex 6
Page 3 of 9
including the use of Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs), and will be subject to prior and post review by IDA
as appropriate.
(c)    TechnicalAssistance and Training: Consultants for providing technical assistance, other than those
required for procurement of works and goods [5(a) and (b) above], will be appointed by MOHFW. The
MOHFW will also be responsible for coordinating all training and fellowships. If necessary, MOHFW may
employ procurement agents for implementing the external training and fellowship programs.
Use of Standard Documents
6.     For ICB procurement, the use of IDA's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for goods and works,
modified by the Government and agreed by IDA, is mandatory. For pharmaceuticals and vaccines, the SBD
for Procurement of Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines (trial edition, January 1995) will be used. For NCB
procurement, the implementing agencies will use the SBDs for goods and works (trial editions 1998), prepared
by the Bank's Bangladesh Dhaka Office (BDO). Consultants' and NGOs' proposals will be invited using the
Bank's Standard Request for P:roposals (SRFP). The Bank's Standard Bid Evaluation Form for Goods and
Works (April 1996, modified by BDO) will be used. In pre-qualifying bidders, the Bank's Standard Pre-
qualification Documents (April 1993) will be used.
Prior Review Thresholds (Table B)
7.     Goods and Works: Prior review by IDA for procurement of goods and works will be limited to the
first two contracts of each fiscal year irrespective of value and all contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of
US$300,000 or more. All other contracts will be subject to selective post-review by IDA.
8.     TechnicalAssistance: IDA's prior review will be required for all Services contracts estimated to cost
exceeding US$100,000 equivalent for firms and US$50,000 for individuals. Other procurement arrangements
subject to prior review by IDA will include: all single-source contracts with consulting firms, amendments to
contracts of consulting firms raising the contract value of those contracts to the equivalent of US$ 100,000 or
more, amendments to contracts of individual consultants raising the contract value of those contracts to the
equivalent of US$50,000 or more, and terms of reference for technical assistance, including studies and
training.
Financial Management
9.     Recognizing the need for improving its financial management systems, GOB initiated the RIBEC
(Reforms in Budgeting and Expenditure Control) project in 1989 with the assistance of expatriate and national
consultants. Under RIBEC, functional and economic classifications of budget and expenditures have been
developed. Development projects are identified by unique codes as cost centers, which will be further
modified to meet the needs of the health and population sector. GOB has selected MOHFW to pilot the
implementation of RIBEC's recommendations, and a Management Accounting Unit (MAU) has been
established, which commenced functioning from July 1997. The MAU has taken the initiative to consolidate
revenue expenditures from different cost centers. Training has been provided to MOHFW's key staff on
recording and reporting. The MAU has initiated compilation of financial information through
computerization, and financial statements are being prepared.
10.    The MAU will be headed by the Chief Accounts Officer of MOHFW. RIBEC is due to move on from
MOHFW at the end of December 1998. By this stage, an integrated mechanism for reporting both the
development and revenue budgets is planned to be established. In order to strengthen the capacity of MAU,
appropriate technical assistance will be provided. Agreement has been reached that MOHFW will review the



Annex 6
Page 4 of 9
staffing and technical assistance needs for financial management and submit its recommendation to IDA for
review by September 30, 1998. Based on IDA's comments, MOHFW will initiate recruitment for permanent
staffing and appointment of consultants to provide technical support by December 31, 1998.
11.    With these arrangements in place, the arrangements for the financial management system (FMS) for
the project will be consistent with IDA's operational policies as indicated in OP/BP 10.02 (Financial
Management). The reports generated from the system will provide an adequate basis for decisions concerning
disbursement under the program. Key aspects of the FMS are as follows:
(a)    Internal Control System: Considering the program approach, financial and operational controls are
essential. This will be achieved by establishing: (i) a Planning and Monitoring Unit; (ii) a Policy and Research
Unit; (iii) a Regulation Section; and (iv) a Finance and Administration Unit within MOHFW as detailed in the
PIP. This will ensure proper allocation of functional responsibilities among the staff. MOHFW's
organization plan showing the functional/reporting relationships between units is given in the PIP.
(b)    Financial Reporting: The MAU will prepare the interim quarterly reports and annual financial
statements for the project. Standardized reporting formats included in the PIP have been reviewed. To meet
the requirerrients of IDA, the formats have been revised and agreed with MOHFW. Financial reports will
show a sumrmary of the project's financial status including: Receipts and Expenditures statement for 'each
quarter,' 'year to-date,' and 'cumulative costs of the program to-date'; Expenditure by Disbursement
Category; and a Special Account Statement.
(c)    Audits: The Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG), through the Directorate of Audits, Foreign
Aided Projects, carries out the audits of foreign-aided projects. Annual audit reports will be submitted to IDA
no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. Technical assistance has been provided by IDA
through the Sixth Technical Assistance Project for strengthening of the Directorate, and further assistance is
being provided by UNDP. This will ensure quality audits covering both revenue and development
expenditures under the program approach.
(d)    Performance Audits: In addition to C&AG's audits, performance audits will be conducted by
internationally reputed audit firms. The terms of reference and selection method of such audit firms will be
reviewed by IDA, and the costs for conducting such audits will be eligible for financing under the Project.
The perforinance audits will undertake a thorough inventory and physical verification of assets procured under
the program and will also verify the financial statements. Two such audits will be carried out: the first will be
carried out during the second year of project implementation and the second during the fourth year.
DISBURSEMENT
Allocation of Credit Proceeds (Table C)
12.    Netherlands, Sweden and DflD have agreed to provide funds into Pooled Funds Accounts. These
Accounts will be administered by the Bank. Disbursements under the Credit will be carried out under five
categories. The categories of financing and the disbursement percentages for such financing are shown in
Table C. In addition, there will be an "Unallocated" category. Allocations to different categories will be made
on an annual basis based on the work program agreed with the development partners. Under Categories 2 to 5,
IDA and Pooled Funds cofinanciers will disburse on apro rata basis against specific contracts for the
procurement of drugs, vaccines and contraceptives; diagnostic and surgical goods and ambulances; essential
goods; technical assistance, training, fellowships, surveys and research; and NGO support. Under Category 1,
IDA and the Pooled Funds cofinanciers will reimburse a portion of all eligible expenditures incurred annually
for activities, excluding the expenditure already funded by other donors or by IDA directly. The disbursement



- 57 -                                       Annex 6
Page 5 of 9
percentage for year 2 to year 5 under Category I will be determined at the time of the Annual Program Review
carried out jointly by the government and the development partners. Apart from the ineligible categories
mentioned below (para. 15), all expenditures, such as operating costs, supplies, goods, civil works and
maintenance expenses, incurred in delivering the program or sub-programs, whether incurred under the
revenue or the development budget, will be eligible for financing.
13.    For time-slice financing (Category 1), the MAU will be responsible for preparation and submission of
separate claims for reimbursement from IDA and the other development partners. Both revenue and
development expenditures will be incurred at the cost centers by Thana Accounts Offices, District Accounts
Offices and the office of the CAO. In addition, the line directors will also incur development expenditures.
Information about all expenditures, both revenue and development, will be compiled by the MAU. A separate
Project Account will be established in a commercial bank and will be maintained by MOHFW.
Reimbursement from the Special Account for this Category to the Project Account will be made upon
certification by the CAO on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs). However, all supporting
documents should be retained at the cost centers for verification by auditors and supervision missions of
development partners. The MAU should maintain cross references to the combined SOEs while submitting
reimbursement claims to IDA amd the other development partners. The preferred method of submitting
reimbursement applications is on a monthly basis. However, reimbursement on a quarterly basis is also
acceptable.
14.    Disbursements under Categories 2 to 5 will follow standard procedures, i.e., payments through the
Special Account and replenishrnent to it. The MAU will also be responsible for preparation and submission of
the withdrawal applications under Categories 2 to 5. In addition, for large contracts direct payments or
payments through L/Cs (supported by Special Commitments) may be made. Full documentation will be
submitted to IDA for goods and works contracts valued at US$300,000 or above, contracts with consulting
finrns and NGOs for US$100,000 or above, and contracts with individuals for US$50,000 or above. All
expenditures for training and fellowships and those below the above thresholds will be on the basis of SOE.
Ineligible Disbursement
15.    Certain categories of expenditure, such as land acquisition, taxes and duties, will be ineligible for
funding from the Credit. Further, Reserved Procurement or investments that are not agreed by the
development partners during the Annual Program Review will be ineligible for financing under the Credit.
Contracts that are declared as "misprocurement" by IDA will also be ineligible.
Retroactive Financing
16.    Disbursement may be claimed retroactively for eligible expenditure incurred after July 1, 1998 in
respect of essential items such as pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and contraceptives which have not been financed
under the IDA-supported Fourth Population and Health Project or by other development partners. The
retroactive financing will be limited to US$25 million. This will ensure a financing transition between the
Fourth Project and this Project by ensuring flow of funding for program implementation. This provision will
not be required if the DCA is signed on or before June 30, 1998.
Special Account
17.    To facilitate the implementation of the project, the Borrower will open and maintain two Special
Accounts in US dollars with Bangladesh Bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The first Special
Account will be only for eligible expenditures under Category 1, while the second Special Account will cover
eligible expenditures under Categories 2 to 5. In addition to IDA funds, funds from the other Pooled Funds

cofinanciers will also deposited in these accounts. The MAU will have access to these Special Accounts and
will be responsible for seeking replenishment to them. The authorized allocation to the first Special Account
will be limited to US$9 million, while that for the second account will be US$8 million. However, until the
Pooled Funds are made available to the Bank, the authorized allocations will be limited to US$7 million and
US$6 million respectively.

DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE
PERFORMANCE AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
HEALTH AND POPULATION PROGRAM PROJECT(HPPP)
(and Accompanying SOE and Special Account)
Objective
The objective of the Performance Audit of the Financial Statements (FSs) is to enable the auditor to
express a professional opinion on the financial position of components of the Health and Population Program
project (HPPP) as at June 30th each year and of the funds received and expenditures for each fiscal year ended
on that date as reported by the FSs, (as well as an opinion as to the accuracy and propriety of the Statements of
Expenditures - SOEs).
The accounts (books of account for each component) of HPPP provide the basis for preparation of the
FSs and are established to reflect the financial transactions in respect of the program, as maintained by the
implementing agency.
General
The auditor should be given access to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), Cost Tables of the
program, the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) and all other legal documents, correspondence, and any
other information associated with the program deemed necessary by the auditor. Confirmation should also be
obtained of amounts disbursed and outstanding at the Bank and of amounts disbursed under other donor grants
if any. Bank Task Managers can assist in obtaining these confirmations.
It is highly desirable that the auditor become familiar with the Bank's Guidelines on Financial
Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank, which summarizes the Bank's financial
reporting and auditing requirements. The auditor should also be familiar with the Bank's Disbursement
procedures. Both documents will be provided by the Task Manager.
Scope
The audit will be carried out in accordance with International Standards of Auditing, and will include
such tests and controls as the auditor considers necessary under the circumstances. In conducting the audit,
special attention should be paid to the following:
(a)    That all external funds have been used in accordance with the conditions of the DCA, with due regard
to economy and efficiency, and only for the purposes for which the financing was provided;
(b)    That counterpart funds have been provided and used in accordance with the conditions of the DCA,
with due regard to economy and efficiency, and only for the purposes for which they were provided;
(c)    That goods and services financed under the program have been procured in accordance with the terms
of the DCA, have been maintained in appropriately secure storage facilities, and have been accounted for using
properly maintained inventory records which are reconciled periodically (at least annually) to the physical
inventories.
(d)    All necessary supporting documents, records, and accounts (including a Fixed Assets Register for all
significant fixed assets procured by the project) have been kept in respect of all project ventures. Clear



Attachement to Annex 6
- 63 -                                      Page 2 of5
linkages should exist between the books of account and reports presented to the Bank. The Fixed Assets
Register should indicate the location of all significant Fixed Assets and should be verified with physical assets
on a periodic basis (at least annually).
(e)    Where Special Accounts have been used, they have been maintained in accordance with the provision
of the DCA;
(f)    The accounts of HPPF' have been prepared in accordance with consistently applied International
Accounting Standards and give a true and fair view of the financial situation of the program at June 30th and
of resources and expenditures for the year ended on that date.
Financial Statements
The Financial Statements should include:
(a)    a Summary of Funds Received, showing funds received from the World Bank, other donors, and
counterpart funds from Government separately for the current fiscal year and accumulated to date;
(b)    a Summary of Expendlitures shown under the main components and by main categories of
expenditures, both for the current fiscal year and accumulated to date; and
(c)    a Balance Sheet showing Accumulated Funds of the Program, bank balances, inventories on hand,
fixed assets and other assets and liabilities (if any) of the project.
As an annex to the Financial Statements, the auditor should prepare a reconciliation between the
amounts shown as "received fiom the World Bank" and that shown as being disbursed by the Bank. As part of
that reconciliation, the auditor should indicate the mechanism for the disbursements, i.e. Special Accounts,
Statement of Expenditures, or direct reimbursement.
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs)
In addition to the audit of the FSs, the auditor is required to audit all SOEs used as the basis for the
submission of withdrawal applications. The auditor should apply such tests and controls as the auditor
considers necessary under the circumstances. These expenditures should be carefully compared with
disbursement categories of Schedule I to the DCA and with reference to the Cost Tables and PAD for
guidance when necessary. Where ineligible expenditures are identified as having been included in withdrawal
applications and reimbursed against, these should be separately noted by the auditor. Annexed to the Financial
Statements should be a schedule listing individual SOE withdrawal applications by specific reference number
and amount. The total withdrawals under the SOE procedure should be part of the overall reconciliation of the
Bank disbursements described above.
Special Accounts
In conjunction with the audit of the Financial Statements, the auditor is also required to audit the
activities of the Special Account. The Special Account usually comprises:
*      deposits and replenishments received from the Bank
*      payments substantiated by withdrawal applications
*      interest that may be earned from the balances and which belong to the borrower; and
*      the remaining balance at the end of each fiscal year.



Attachement to Annex 6
Page 3 of 5
The auditor must form an opinion as to the degree of compliance with the Bank's procedures and
correctness of the balance of the Special Account at year-end. The audit should examine the eligibility and
correctness of financial transactions during the period under review and fund balances at the end of such a
period, the operation and use of the SA in accordance with the DCA, and the adequacy of internal controls for
this type of disbursement mechanism.
For this HPPP, the Special Account is referred to in the DCA. The Special Account statements and
the auditor's report should be submitted as part of the Financial Statements.
Audit Opinion
In addition to the primary opinion on the Financial Statements, the annual audit report should include
a separate paragraph commenting on the accuracy and propriety of expenditures withdrawn under SOE
procedures. The separate audit report on the Special Account Statement should include an audit opinion, as
noted above. The Financial Statements, including the Special Account Statement and the audit reports
thereon, should be received by the Bank no later than three months after the end of the accounting period to
which the audit refers. The auditor should submit the reports to MOHFW and the ministry should then
promptly forward two copies of the audited financial statements and audit reports to the Bank and concerned
HPPP line Directors. Model audit reports for Financial Statements and SOEs and also for the Special Account
are attached hereto for guidance.
Management Letter
In addition to the audit reports, the auditor will prepare a "management letter", in which the auditor
will comment on the significant findings for each component as follows:
(a)    any observations on the notes to the accounts, accounting records, systems, and internal controls that
were examined during the course of the audit;
(b)    identify specific deficiencies and areas of weakness in systems and internal controls and make
recommendations for their improvement;
(c)    report on the degree of compliance of each of the financial covenants in the DCA and give comments,
if any, on internal and external matters affecting such compliance.
(d)    communicate matters that have come to attention during the audit which might have a significant
impact on the implementation of the program; and
(e)    bring to the borrower's attention any other matters that the auditors considers pertinent.
Working Papers
The auditor should develop an audit program and maintain working papers in a systematic manner and these
should be made available for review by the Bank and concerned Government Authorities upon request.
