                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1.      This Restructuring Paper responds to the request of the State of Rio Grande do
Norte to make the following changes to the Rio Grande do Norte Integrated Water
Resources Management Project: (1) extension of 14 months in the Loan Agreement
7488-BR closing date, from November 30, 2012 to March 31, 2014; (2) reallocation of
Loan proceeds among its categories; and (3) adjustment of Project targets and indicators
to ensure that these are measurable within the timeframe for completion and in line with
the priority activities being supported by the Project.

2.     The proposed changes have been requested by the Government of the State of Rio
Grande do Norte through official letters to the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs (SEAIN) N°.
301/2011-GE dated November 7, 2011, and N°. 050/2012-GE dated February 13, 2012.
The Commission for External Financing (COFIEX) issued its Recommendation N°. 669
for approval of the request on March 14, 2012. The Bank received the final request from
the Secretariat of the National Treasury on April 26, 2012.

3.      The main reasons for these changes are: (1) delays in start up and implementation
of activities; (2) changes in the State Government Administration resulting in major
changes in the implementing agency teams; (3) exchange rate losses; (4) increase in
Project costs due to the gap between preparation and implementation and to the heating
of the Brazilian market caused by investment programs launched by the Federal
Government; and (5) need for better alignment of activities prioritized within the scope of
the Project to the amount of available funding.

B. PROJECT STATUS

4.      The Project was approved by the Board on September 18, 2007 in the amount of
US$35.9 million. The Loan Agreement was signed on June 20, 2008, and became
effective on August 18, 2008, with a closing date of November 30, 2012. The Loan is
47.6% percent disbursed, and has an undisbursed balance of USD 18,797,050.00. The
audit report due on June 30, 2012 has not been received by the Bank yet. The client faced
delays in finalizing the procurement process to contract the auditing services. The process
is now being finalized and it has been agreed that the audit report will be submitted to the
Bank by August 31, 2012.

5.       Project Development Objective (PDO) is rated Satisfactory. Overall, project
implementation has also been satisfactory. The State team was very committed over the
first eighteen months after Effectiveness and a setback was felt in 2010 caused by the
electoral year. A new Administration took office in 2011 and the new Secretary and team
assigned to the Project have shown their commitment and have made extra efforts to
improve implementation. The activities under execution are progressing well but it is

                                             4
expected that many of them will be completed beyond the current closing date.
According to the revised Procurement Plan, the remaining activities programmed to
initiate over the next few months will commit the total of Project funds and will be
executed during the revised period of implementation.

6.      This project represents a strategic tool for the development of the water resources
sector in the State of Rio Grande do Norte. Although the total Loan amount is modest,
important structural changes in the sector are being achieved by the Project, the most
noteworthy being the water resources sector institutional reform that will provide a
benchmark for the State. The Project financed the revision of the legal and institutional
frameworks for the structuring of the State water resources sector to allow for the
adequate management of the resources and to respond to the State’s development needs.
The support and continuity provided by the Bank have been essential to bring expertise
and help in the discussions with other areas of the State. The proposed reforms are being
reviewed by the Governor’s office and will be submitted to the Assembly for approval in
August 2012.

7.      Other important results are being achieved by the Project, which is fostering the
discussion about the future of small and medium sized irrigation perimeters such as
Cruzeta, very common in the Semi-Arid Region of Brazil. The pilot water and soil
conservation activities being carried out in the Cobra basin have already shown good
results. It is expected that this pilot will be replicated in other areas of the State. In
addition, the Project is providing support to the reduction of water losses in the
Monsenhor Expedito pipeline system that supplies water to 30 municipalities in the State;
and to increase the access to water supply for 3000 families in rural areas.

8.      The legal and institutional reforms and the strengthening of the sector are crucial
for the state in the context of the ongoing São Francisco River Basin Integration Project,
which will divert water from the São Francisco river basin into two basins in the State.
The water from the São Francisco is expected to reach the State of Rio Grande do Norte
by 2015. In addition, the learning generated from the activities in Cruzeta irrigation
perimeter is important not only for the State but it is also linked to the Federal
Government’s More Irrigation Program (“Programa Mais Irrigação?), which aims at
different strategies for the development of the country’s irrigation sector. The Program’s
fourth Pillar focuses on the implementation and rehabilitation of public irrigation projects
occupied by small producers, through the coordination with other levels of Government
and structuring of the productive chain. In this context, the proposed project extension
will allow the execution of activities that support a much broader water resources agenda
at both the state and federal levels.

9.      The higher level objective of the project is to promote economic, social, and
environmentally sustainable development through the implementation of an integrated
water resources management system. Mostly by focusing on institutional strengthening
and rehabilitation of key bulk water infrastructure, the proposed project will seek to
consolidate this system, which the state has often overlooked in the past in favor of larger
infrastructure investments. The specific project development objective is to implement an
integrated water resources management system that will support more environmentally
sustainable use of water resources while also increasing access of poor families to
                                             5
reliable potable water and decreasing operational and maintenance costs of water
allocation and distribution systems.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

10.     Project Results/Indicators. This restructuring paper proposes few modifications to
the results framework, which do not impact the achievement of the Project’s
Development Objectives. These proposed changes to targets and indicators are needed in
order to better align the activities prioritized within the scope of the Project to the amount
of available funding. The activities that will fall out of the Project scope will be
implemented by the Borrower with other sources of funds, including the Bank-financed
Federal Integrated Water Sector Project – Interáguas.

11.     The proposed changes were discussed between the Borrower and the Bank during
the Mid-Term Review mission carried out from June 13 to 17, 2011. These changes are
detailed in Annex 1.

12.     Financing. The adjusted Project Cost table with the breakdown by Component is
the following.

14.    Closing date. The Loan Agreement 7488-BR closing date is proposed to be
extended from November 30, 2012 to March 31, 2014 (a 14 month-extension) to allow an
appropriate timetable for the Secretariat of Environment and Water Resources of the
State of Rio Grande do Norte, executing agency of this Project, to complete project
implementation, finalize its activities and achieve the Development Objectives.
