1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At appraisal (2001), Congo was emerging from a decade of three civil wars that destroyed the
basic infrastructures and contributed to weaken the capacity of the public administration.
In response, the Government presented a three-year Interim Post-Conflict Program for the period
2000-2002 which provided for (a) the pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies and stabilization
measures, particularly in the field of public finance management, (b) pursuit of the privatization
program, (d) improvement of governance, accountability and transparence, and (e) the
improvement of the business regulatory framework.

It was clear from the start of the reconstruction process that external assistance from the
development community was needed to overcome resistance from vested interest groups to
transparency and governance reforms, as well as to overcome institutional inertia towards the
proposed policy and administrative reforms. In this context, the TGCB project was a central
element of the technical and financial support provided by the development community to assist
the Republic of Congo resolve its public finance imbalances, renew its economic growth, and
begin to alleviate poverty, as identified among the main priorities for the post conflict program.
The TGCB project was one of the first investment lending operations in Congo after the Bank
renewed its cooperation in 2001. It also intended to support implementation of the structural
reforms that were agreed with the Government of Congo under the Post Conflict Economic
Rehabilitation Credit (PCERC), an adjustment credit granted to Congo in 2001 in order to settle
its debt arrears due to the Bank and that were accumulated during the period of wars. The PCERC
aimed to encourage the Government to pursue policy and structural reforms needed to stabilize
the economy and expand the role of the private sector. Key reforms included: the privatization
program, including restructuring and privatization of all commercial banks, privatization of all
forestry companies, and privatization of all key public utilities (water and electricity,
telecommunications, railway, oil downstream activities), reform of the legal and regulatory
framework in key sectors, improved business incentives, and market liberalization. Post Conflict
Economic Rehabilitation Credit was closed in June 2004. The ICR for the PCERC was completed
in June 2005 and the project performance was rated satisfactory.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

Project Development Objective. The original project development objective was: To increase
efficiency of (i) the petroleum operations; (ii) the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of
Planning1 operations; and (iii) Government‟s public enterprise reform and privatization process.
The initial project was an integral part of the reform action program supported under the Post-
Conflict Economic Rehabilitation Credit. An extract of the original results framework is
presented above under Section F. Results Framework Analysis, Phase 1 (2003-2006) that includes
those indicators for which information was available.
The project was originally designed to address the issue of transparency in the decision-making
processes of the government and its agencies, assigning high priority to the management of oil

resources and state budgetary expenditure processes, including public procurement. The project
also intended to support greater transparency of government‟s disengagement from productive
activities in the economy, as it intended to help strengthen the Privatization Committee, and to
help draft the implementation decrees permitting greater participation of the private sector in the
ownership and management of utilities. Finally, the project aimed at helping design an action plan
for strengthening partnership and dialogue between government and the private sector.
Project Description Summary: As originally designed the project included five components:
(i) Component 1: Increasing transparency and improving governance of oil and gas
    operations. The project was to provide technical assistance, training and some equipment to
    improve Government‟s capacity to establish effective operational and fiscal control over the
    sector. In a first phase, the project was to concentrate on designing an action plan, based on
    the results of the assessment and operational audit of the sector. The next phase was to help
    the Ministry of Finance and SNPC implement the recommendations and activities scheduled
    during the first phase.
(ii) Component 2: Increasing transparency and improving governance of non-oil and gas
     operations. The objective was to increase transparency and improve governance and
     decision-making in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning and their agencies
     by procuring technical assistance, equipment and training for: (a) improving three priority
     areas (strategic planning, national statistics and public accounting), (b) enhancing financial
     controls of the State, (c) strengthening resource mobilization, (d) conducting a thorough
     review of the Central Commission for Public Contracts, as well as (e) strengthening of the
     capacity of the Supreme Audit Institution (CDC).
(iii) Component 3: Increasing transparency and improving governance of the privatization
      process. The project was to support the Borrower‟s public enterprise reform and privatization
      process by providing technical assistance, training and equipment to (a) strengthen the
      Privatization Committee and clarify the regulatory framework of the private sector; (b)
      enhance the capacity of the Center for Business Administration (CFE). to promote private
      investment in the country; (c) assess the National Center for Management‟s (CENAGES)
      strengths and weaknesses and provide recommendations on the future status of the company;
      and (d) strengthen the dialogue and partnership among Government, civil society and the
      private sector.
(iv) Component 4: Designing an action plan for the Africa Region’s HIV/AIDS umbrella.
    The project intended to support the country‟s efforts to design an overall strategy and action
    plan for the HIV/AIDS regional umbrella program financed by the Bank.

(v) Component 5: The Project Coordinating Unit. Given the weakness of local human and
    institutional capacity as well as the risk of corruption, the project provided for a strong
    Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), to be guided by a high level Steering Committee, and an
    Inter-ministerial Reform Implementation Committee (IRIC).

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

Following achievement of the HIPC Decision Point in March 2006, and agreement on the HIPC
Action Plan signed on August 1, 2006, the Government requested for a supplemental financing by
IDA and requested realignment of the project with the priorities agreed under the HIPC Action Plan.
The Government then committed to add its own resources to the project to provide the level of
financing required for effective support to implement the main triggers of the Action Plan.

Given the need to facilitate the implementation of the HIPC Action Plan, and considering the
results of the Mid-Term Review of the project, it was agreed in October 2006, during a mission by
the Country Director, to add supplementary resources to the project as well as to restructure it to
ensure its alignment with the HIPC agenda. Detailed arrangements for the restructuring and the
allocation of additional resources by IDA and the Government were agreed during the supervision
missions undertaken in November 2006 and January 2007.

The decision to use additional financing to restructure the project and provide supplementary
resources rather than designing a repeater project or a new SIL was taken for two reasons. First,
there was a need to secure substantial financial assistance rapidly if progress was to be made in the
HIPC process as the remaining project resources were insufficient for this purpose. Second, the use
of additional financing allowed for extension of the project closing date to avoid a break in support
as the project was scheduled for completion in June 2007 and closing in December 2007.

The proposed changes to the original project amounted to: (i) a revision of the description,
objectives and funds allocated to the project components, and (ii) a revision of the implementation
arrangements, in particular changes in order to enhance capacity in procurement and financial
management. The closing date was extended by two-and-half years to June 2010 in order to ensure
continued support to the Government in the implementation of the HIPC Action Plan.

Revised components of the project. As a result of the restructuring, the number of components
was reduced from five to three. Also, the focus of the oil sector governance component shifted
from transparency measures (audits, revenue certification etc.) to more complex and sustainable
reform measures such as the development of an integrated and generally accessible database on all
aspects of oil sector management, and implementation of oil marketing reforms. There was also a
fundamental revision of the non-oil revenue component to become a full-fledged public financial
management component, supporting implementation of the Public Finance Management (PFM)
action plan agreed between the Government and its external partners in January 2007 which
included public investment management, procurement reform, and wage bill management. Included
also was a focus on IT systems as an instrument to enhance transparency in budget management,
thus leading to a significant increase in funds allocated under the “goods? category. The
restructuring also meant elimination of the component relating to transparency and governance in
the privatization process, due to the unsatisfactory performance in that process. Finally, a new sub-
component was added to support the anti-corruption efforts of the Government, in particular the
internal government Anti-Corruption Commission, responsible for implementation of the anti-
corruption action plan, and the Anti-Corruption Observatory, the external monitoring body that
tracks and evaluates the progress made in the implementation of the anti-corruption agenda.

Revised Project Development Objective. These changes resulted in a revised PDO to reflect the
new focus on budget management and elimination of the privatization component. The revised
Project Development Objective was: “The project aims to enhance governance, transparency and
effectiveness in public sector financial management, including the oil sector?.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program.

Enhancing transparency and governance. The Republic of Congo was (and still is largely)
perceived as a country with severe corruption problems, with a system of public procurement that
avoids open competition, and where access to information on public affairs and finances is
considered the privilege of the administrative elite. In such an environment, where the oil sector
was closed to public scrutiny, it was necessary to create an institutional framework able to tackle
the issue of corruption, to strengthen transparency, more specifically concerning oil sector
revenues and operations, to enhance transparence and governance more largely throughout the
public sector, and to reform the public procurement institutions and methods.

Modernizing and enhancing public sector management procedures, systems and tools. After a
long period of civil unrest, the administration was left with poor human capacity, complex and
cumbersome administrative procedures, and outmoded management tools both in terms of
software and hardware. The wage bill management system, the management systems of the
customs and tax departments, the public investment selection and monitoring system, and the
public expenditure management system were all in dire need of updating, modernization and
security enhancement.

Strengthening Economic Governance. In a country whose main export is subject to dramatic
price movements as was the case with oil and gas in recent decades, management of public
revenues as well as the allocation of resources, and more specifically the choice of public
investments all raise the issues of sustainability and stability of economic growth. Good economic
governance in such circumstances calls for well identified and implemented economic priorities
supported by instruments such as a PRSP and medium-term expenditure frameworks, a
systematic and transparent mechanism to manage investment projects, and prudent management
of revenues, especially in periods of sudden increases of receipts due to high oil and gas prices.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas.

Cancellation of the privatization component and successful completion of the Regional
HIV/AIDS Action Plan meant a centering of the project‟s energy and resources on fewer sectors,
specifically on sectors where at the time of the launching of the HIPC agenda it was felt reforms
were possible.

1.6 Other significant changes

 The most significant change resulting from the project restructuring was to provide a more
precise focus. Indeed, it was the wish of both the Congolese authorities and the Bank
management that the project focuses its energies and resources in order to facilitate the
implementation of the HIPC Action Plan so that the Republic of Congo could maximize its
chances of attaining the HIPC Completion Point. For this purpose additional financing was
approved to implement the revised components as described above.

Revised Implementation Arrangements. Given the high risk environment in which the project
continued to operate (in particular the risk of corruption), the Bank maintained its policy of ring
fencing the project finances, with the intention of reinforcing the Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) as the project implementation instrument. Such a policy was at that time advocated under
the Interim Strategy Report (ISR).




                                                4
Extension of Closing Date. The credit closing date was extended from December 31, 2007 to
June 30, 2010 in order to allow for the continuation of the project activities in view of the
implementation of HIPC Action Plan reforms and triggers. This change did not affect
achievement of PDO nor the outcome indicators. The closing date was later extended to June 30,
2011, as major activities were not completed in due date.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program performance

Preparation. The TGCB Project was prepared in response to requests from the Government to
help secure the newly established peace in the country, enhance institutional and human capacity,
and reform public finance management, creating a strong rationale for the Bank‟s intervention. It
took six months to prepare the operation within the framework of the Transitional Support
Strategy (TSS). The design of the project was based on the lessons learned from the experience of
similar post-conflict countries and earlier interventions in the Republic of Congo.

Design. The project was designed in the difficult post-conflict environment that Congo
experienced from 2000 onwards. It was also a time of low oil and gas prices that translated into
low revenues for the Government, which in turn meant budget deficits and macroeconomic
disequilibrium. The original Development Objective of the project was relevant as it focused on
strengthening the policy orientations and the administrative operations of the government at a
moment when the country was attempting a return to political stability and economic growth after
years of civil war. By directly financing measures and activities aimed at increasing the revenues
of the government, and by addressing corruption, the project aimed to support increasing public
revenues and improved utilization of those resources.

The original project components sought to enhance transparency and governance of public affairs
and finances. Component A, transparency and governance in the oil sector, was a first attempt to
strengthen management of the main source of state revenues and thus help macro-economic
stabilization. Component B, transparency and governance in the public sector, aimed at
supporting the administration, in the areas of economic and financial planning, allocation of
public resources, budgeting and monitoring of expenditures, procurement and expenditure
systems and procedures. It was assumed these reforms would mean increased revenues and more
efficient expenditures, with the main beneficiary of the project being the Congolese population in
general and the poor in particular.

Quality at Entry. The project‟s identification of key issues and priorities, expected results,
beneficiaries, and implementation arrangements were well chosen given the challenges facing the
government following the civil war. The result, however, was a complex and possibly over-
ambitious project that tackled too many difficult reforms at once in a low capacity environment.
As events demonstrated this overly complex design meant that implementation was difficult and
took longer than expected. It also meant that progress in certain areas such as reform of public
enterprises not achieved.

The project was originally designed in line with the Interim Post-Conflict Program (2000-2002),
and evolved as part of the policy framework of the Transitional Support Strategy (2002-2007)
that later gave way to a full-fledged Country Assistance Strategy. After restructuring, the project
became so to speak the operational instrument of the HIPC implementation process (2007-2010).




                                                5
Throughout those years, the project activities were refined and adjusted using analytical works
such as (i) the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA - 2006), (ii) the Country
Procurement Issue Paper (CPIP - 2006), (iii) Congo‟s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment, (iv) the Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (2006), (v) the Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability (PEFA), and (vi) the Public Expenditure Review (2008). It is worth
mentioning that the ISN of 2007 as well as the 2011 CPS Progress Report both confirmed the
project‟s main orientations and the Bank team‟s perception of the problems as well as the
progress achieved in public finance management reform.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

At the beginning of the project, oil and gas prices increased rapidly and steadily, so much so that
the economic and financial context of the project changed from an initial gap and deficit
financing problem to presenting the challenge of ensuring effective management of a significant
budget surplus.

At the same time, relations with the Bretton Woods institutions became more positive and
constructive the result being that the HIPC Decision Point was reached in early 2006. From
thereon, the framework, dynamic and pace of the reform agenda changed significantly. Yet the
Congolese administration was in need of technical support and financial resources in order to
coordinate and implement the reform agenda leading to the HIPC Completion Point. It was felt
from the start that the TGCB project was the right instrument in those circumstances. A Mid-
Term Review of the project was conducted in November 2006, and the restructured TGCB
project, modified with a view of helping the Republic of Congo reach the HIPC Completion Point,
was approved by the Board in early 2007. As a result, the dynamics sustaining the project had
changed for the better. Given the high stakes related to the HIPC agenda, the project thereafter
benefitted from the political will related to the important economic and political incentives
involved.

The Republic of Congo has experienced continued economic growth as the result of
improvements in fiscal discipline and debt management. According to the 2010 IMF World
Economic Outlook Report, Congo was the fastest growing economy in Africa in 2010. Real GDP
is estimated to have expanded by 9.1 percent in 2010, compared to 7.5 percent in 2009, based on
continued high growth in the oil sector as well as accelerated growth in the non-oil sector. The
resilience of the Congolese economy continues despite the global economic downturn. Economic
prospects remain favorable with a projected growth rate of 7.8 percent for 2011. This meant that
project implementation could proceed as planned without disturbance by external factors.

The Project Coordinating Unit was reinforced starting in 2007 with the addition of a local
monitoring and evaluation specialist, supplementary training opportunities, material and
equipment. Though the Steering Committee of the project only met once during the eight years of
the project, the implementation of the HIPC Completion Point process was supervised by an
Inter-ministerial Steering Committee that, in practice, acted as the PCU‟s Steering Committee
given the close working links between the project goals and the HIPC agenda.

The project also benefited from the reinforced supervision and monitoring that followed from
adoption of the HIPC Action Plan. Given the results at stake as well as the complexities of the
HIPC agenda, implementation of the HIPC Action Plan had to be supervised and monitored
closely and frequently. Because the project was then directly involved in the implementation of
the HIPC Action Plan, it was supervised more closely and frequently than would have otherwise
been the case. Furthermore, the HIPC agenda being at the center stage of public affairs for some


                                                6
three years, meant the project received more public exposure and attention from the Congolese
authorities as well as from the donors. Difficulties and delays in the implementation of the HIPC
agenda necessarily impacted the project‟s activities and results. In that regard, for instance, the
HIPC progress reports of May 2007 and October 2008 played an important role by providing
important “benchmarks? that helped both the pursuit of the policy dialogue and implementation
of TGCB project activities.
It should finally be mentioned that the project, like other Bank financed projects in Congo, are
now managed from the field, with the Task Team Leaders and experts either based in Brazzaville
or Kinshasa. This, as well as close follow up from the Country Manager and the Country Director,
has helped to enhance the quality of the Bank‟s dialogue with the authorities and a sharper focus
on the broader sector issues.

Before restructuration, the project was to be financed by the Bank (US$ 7.0 million), the GoC
and other donors, of which AFDB (US$ 1.64 million), the EU and France (US$ 0.857 million)
were the most important donors. Due to various reasons, other donors financing failed to
materialize their promise. The restructured project was to be co-financed by the GoC and the
Bank. The GoC decided to increase its contribution to US$ 5.6 million, to be managed directly by
the PCU. Given that the HIPC agenda now was the general framework of the project, its
objectives and component were designed in close cooperation with other donors, in particular the
EU (which supported actions related to external financial control and accountability), the IMF
(which supported ongoing work on budget classification and public expenditure prioritization),
the French Government (which supported a variety of actions on governance, including on public
investment management), and ADB and UNDP, which together represent the main donors present
in the Republic of Congo.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The original PCU did not include an M&E specialist and it is only at the time of the project
restructuring that a specialist was hired. Nonetheless, it took time before a performing M&E
system was operational. In addition, though few indicators were included in the original project
document (2002) indicators were added prior to and during the restructuring which is why 2007 is
the baseline year for many of the project indicators.

Selecting indicators to monitor and evaluate the reforms and activities related to such concepts as
transparency and accountability proved to be a challenge. Also, the end of project targets, were
defined during a supervision mission without being cited in any Bank or project document.
Moreover, the results of the surveys conducted in 2009 and 2011 to monitor perceptions of
corruption in the use of public resources are difficult to interpret and don‟t provide a clear picture
of these perceptions. One can also question the relevance of linking these measures of perceived
corruption to the impact of reforms that were still in their infancy. Finally, since the project was
so closely connected to the HIPC agenda, the project was also monitoring indicators used as
triggers of the HIPC completion point agenda which generated some confusion with monitoring
of the project‟s own results and achievements.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

A new phase of the project is actually under preparation. Such a follow-up operation is
necessary given that some project activities were not completed before the closing date and
because the nature and complexity of the reforms supported during the project means in some
cases continued support is desirable to ensure they continue, especially as the incentive provided


                                                  7
by the HIPC agenda has been removed. These include reforms related to governance and
transparency in the oil sector, changes in the public procurement, as well as modernization of the
personal and payroll management systems. In addition, given the dramatic increase of the level
of public revenues and the resulting large increase in public investment expenditures, the
management of public investments, and especially the analysis, preparation and selection of
investment projects, will be at the heart of this follow-up project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The original project’s objectives were highly relevant for the following reasons. In a country
where the oil sector accounts for 65% of GDP, 85% of fiscal revenues and 90% of total export,
good governance, transparency and effectiveness in the oil sector is the starting point of any real
improvement in the management of the economy and of public finances. In a country with a
serious image problem as measured by the Transparency International Index of perceived
corruption or the World Bank‟s Doing Business Survey, governance and transparency issues
should be the focus of any project addressing problems in the conduct of public affairs and public
finances. In a country whose public administration was left with serious institutional and staff
capacity deficiencies after 30 years of centrally planned economic management and close to 10
years of political and civil unrest, it was clear that policy reorientation, institutional reform and
training were crucial steps towards enhancing effectiveness of the public administration.
Following the surge in world oil prices and the recovery of local production, Congo became a
lower middle-income country in terms of GNP per capita. Yet, Congo did not and still does not
compare well with lower middle-income countries, and even lower income countries, as
witnessed by its performance in meeting the Millennium Development Goals. Accordingly, it was
essential that the project also have as one of its main activities the strengthening of strategic
economic planning and public investment selection and management.
The revised project objective was also highly relevant, though more focused, and reflected an
accurate diagnosis of development priorities given the opportunities presented by the HIPC
initiative. The project‟s objective and design were consistent with the 2001 TSS, which clearly
identified as major areas of intervention: (i) the transparency and governance problems; (ii)
strengthening of public institutions and policies; (iii) rebuilding of public finance management
tools; and (iv) the human and institutional capacity building. Issues of transparency and
governance as well of efficient management of public affairs remained a central focus of the
Interim Country Strategy and the following Country Assistance Strategy.

The implementation of the project was also well conceived and organized on the basis of a full-
fledged and well-staffed project coordinating unit, to be supervised by a Steering Committee and
an inter-ministerial oversight committee. Supervision missions were conducted on a regular
biannual basis and even on a quarterly basis during the period prior to the HIPC Completion Point.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives2

    a) Achievement during the pre-restructuring phase

PDO is rated moderately satisfactory at the date of the project restructuring. Significant efforts
have been made to mobilize oil revenue and to reduce fiscal exonerations. Receipts paid by the
SNPC to Treasury increased by almost 59 percent between 2002 and 2005 above the target of 40-
50 percent. And fiscal exonerations declined by 31 percent between 2002 and 2003. Outcomes
have been partially achieved regarding fiscal receipts and payments of arrears by the treasury.
There has been some progress that explains the increase in tax receipt and the reduction in the
arrears at the Treasury, but efforts need to be sustained.
However, the outcome related to customs receipts is rated unsatisfactory as the authorities failed
to increase the customs receipts between 2002 and 2006. The fact that customs revenue counts for
less than 10 percent of the total government revenue did not undermine the fiscal position. In turn,
due to higher oil revenue, the fiscal balance has remained positive over the past years.
Achievement of the PDO is sustained by the following outputs:
Regarding the oil sector, the project helped to undertake the annual SNPC audits for 1999-2001,
2002, 2003 and 2004; annual audits of CORAF for 2002, 2003 and 2004; and launched the
quarterly certification exercise of Government oil revenues. The project also provided assistance
for the implementation of the recommendations including training to SNPC, MH and
Hydrocarbon Unit Staff. The component was rated Satisfactory. The audit practice continued
during the second phase.


Regarding governance in the public sector, the project helped install and equip the General
Auditing Office. Institutional audits of Tax and Customs Administrations were also undertaken to
improve their performance. It also supported the computerization of the debt management system
(SYGADE) and provided training to staff within the Ministry of Finance. The component was
rated satisfactory.
On privatization program, the project was unsatisfactory as no major achievement was reported.
The HIV-AIDS component is rated satisfactory. The project helped to put in place an Action plan
for HIV-AIDS program that was used later to build a comprehensive Multi Year program to fight
against the disease.

    b) Achievement during the post-restructuring phase:

To assess the results achieved following the restructuring it is worth again underlining the close
link between this project and the implementation of the HIPC Action Plan.

3.2.1 The Development Objective of the project was broadly met. Local authorities and
donors concur that governance, transparency and effectiveness in public financial management,
including the oil sector, have been enhanced as a result of the activities conducted with the help
of the project. Information on the project performance indicators as presented at the outset of this



2
  The review of the project‟s outcome and results follows the Revised Results Matrix of 2007, which is
presented in Annex 1 for convenience.



                                                    9
report, generally support the view that change has occurred concerning the conduct of public
affairs, the practices in the area of public administration, and the content and reliability of
information from the administration have all improved due at least in part to the project
interventions. The challenge now is to maintain and extend these reforms and avoid losing ground
where progress has been achieved.

3.2.2 The Outcome Indicators are generally on target. In the results matrix established at the
time of the project‟s restructuring (2007), four indicators were selected to measure achievement
of the Project Development Objective.

(i) Annual EITI reporting. It was expected that the annual EITI reports would reflect increased
adherence by the Republic of Congo to good governance and transparency principles in managing
the oil sector. At the time of the restructuring of the project, the Government of Congo had
merely indicated its intention to adhere to the EITI initiative. A local branch of the EITI was set
up and the promised Action Plan was adopted, and is still being implemented. In December 2010,
the EITI Board decided to maintain the status of Congo as a candidate country in view of the
meaningful progress in implementing the organization‟s principles and objectives. At the time of
the project‟s restructuring, it was anticipated that three EITI annual reports would be validated
and published before its closing date. The first two reports were published and the third report is
expected to be validated and published by the end of 2011, which represents of delay of a year
and a half in reference to the original closing date of the project (June 30, 2010).

(ii) Decrease in the level of perceived corruption. Given the delays in the implementation of the
institutional framework created to contain and fight fraud and corruption, the reforms and actions
supported by the project in connection with governance and transparency have not yet generated
the results anticipated, namely a decrease in the levels of corruption, as perceived by the general
public, in the use of public resources. That being said, the data provided by the two surveys
sponsored by the Anti-corruption Committee and the Corruption Observatory and published in
2009 and 2011, both show increases and decreases in the levels of perceived corruption,
depending on the target group surveyed and the sectors selected. One should probably be prudent
about the real meaning of these perceptions since it was the first time the Congolese public was
asked to express their views about a subject that was to this point somewhat taboo. Yet it shows
the importance of having such surveys done on a regular basis in order to complement our
understanding of the specificities of corruption in Congo. Nevertheless, these surveys tend to
confirm the information provided by Transparency International whose annual surveys show that
the level of corruption perceived by the business community has not decreased significantly over
the past decade. Table 1 presents a summary of available indicators in regards to corruption as
perceived by specific clienteles of different public services. Overall, it appears that work has just
begun on this important subject. But it has indeed started, and this is per se an achievement in a
country with a reputation like that of Congo.

(iii) Increased predictability of budget formulation and execution processes. Given efforts that
were to be made in terms of establishing information systems, rationalizing management systems
and procedures as well as capacity building, it was anticipated that the budget would be prepared,
discussed and voted according to the established schedule and that deviation from the voted
credits would be limited to less than 3%. . In this case, the results do match the expectations. For
the fiscal years 2009 and 2010, the budget was indeed voted on time, and the difference between
actual expenditures and voted credits was less than 3% of GDP. It should nevertheless be
mentioned that differences between expenditures and credits still can be quite large on a line to




                                                 10
line basis, and even on a ministry/sector to ministry/sector basis. Furthermore, no strict
procedures governing credit transfers form line to line nor from ministry to ministry are enforced.

(iv) Alignment of public investment spending with priorities. The project intended to ensure that
the public investment expenditures would reflect priorities selected and defined in the PRSP. It is
now accepted that the public investment credits as well as outlays broadly reflect the priorities
identified in the PRSP. Furthermore, the project comprised reforms and actions designed to
ensure that investment project expenditures would be subject to competitive bidding and that they
could be monitored against the objectives and priorities defined in the PRSP. Here again, results
are in line with objectives, specifically for 2010 and 2011 fiscal years, as the institutional
framework reform and procurement practices newly implemented impose competitive bidding as
the rule. Such results represent a major change from previous practice since competitive bidding
was the exception in matters of public contracts and since public investment expenditures were
basically in line with the political authorities‟ wishes and, for that matter, largely out of tune with
priorities as understood by development technicians and experts, including from the donor
community.

The achievement of the Project’s Development Objective as well as the performance of the
Outcome Indicators is therefore judged as Moderately Satisfactory. Good progress was made in
certain areas, though not in others, as reflected in the indicator summary provided at the outset
of this report. This is perhaps not surprising given the scope and complexity of the issues and
challenges addressed by the project.

3.2.3 The intermediate results per component also show a mixed performance. Results per
component vary from satisfactory to moderately unsatisfactory.

3.2.3.1 Component 1: Oil sector Governance. The predictability in the generation and
management of oil sector revenues was enhanced as expected which as anticipated improved the
Government‟s ability to undertake medium-term budget planning.

With project support, audits were conducted each fiscal year from 1999 to 2009 inclusively. The
audit of the 2010 fiscal year accounts are under way, the so-called social accounts having already
been approved by SNPC‟s Board as the consolidated accounts are expected to be approved by the
end of 2011. As expected, SNPC‟s annual accounts have been reviewed by independent external
auditors of international reputation. The first annual external audits identified important
weaknesses and inefficient procedures as well as governance problems, most of which were
addressed. Gradually annual audit reports improved until at the time of the HIPC Completion
Point, SNPC received compliments form the IMF and the Bank for the extent and quality of
reforms implemented. Furthermore, and as agreed upon, quarterly transfers of revenues to the
GoC have been certified by an independent conciliator for the years 2007 (second half), 2008,
2009 and 2010. Certifications for 2011 have not yet been released due to a lack of information, a
situation that according to the SNPC was recently corrected.

As for the second intermediary result indicator pertaining to the oil sector, as the competitive
exploration and production awarding system is still under consideration, no contracts have yet
been awarded under such a system.

Thirdly, the proposed database is now operational (and is considered by SNPC officials as their
“coup d’ éclat?). A centralized oil sector data bank was created, with different levels of
accessibility for the general public, oil sector companies and government institutions, in view of


                                                  11
assuring consistency and transparency of available data on oil sector management, and
modernizing the management of the sector. This data bank was the first step of the
computerization of the modeling of oil reserves (another result of the project not identified as an
indicator).

The fourth indicator, qualitative in nature, stating that the reform of the SNPC oil marketing
system should ensure that the system is brought in line with international best practice, is partially
met since the competitive exploration and production awarding system is not yet operational.
Furthermore, the objective will be considered fulfilled when Congo obtains its EITI validation
which is the quality assurance mechanism process for countries implementing the EITI standard.

Other results achieved under this component include: (i) SNPC‟s accounting system was
reformed, (ii) a medium-term sector strategy was designed for the development of the oil sector,
(iii) oil marketing practices were studied to ensure that Congolese oil is sold at the best possible
price for the country, (iv) the oil sector monitoring units at the Ministry of Finance and the
Petroleum Directorate were strengthened, and (v) the assets of the former Hydro Congo were
valued and; (vi) capacity building was achieved.

As measured by its results indicators, this component is viewed as moderately satisfactory. It is
also important to question the durability of some results of this component in view of the lack of
collaboration and openness from SNPC during 2011.

3.2.3.2 Component 2: Public sector Governance. The second component includes four sub-
components whose results are considered separately given their specific circumstances and
achievements.

(i) Anti-corruption structures. The project supported the creation and installation of the
structures needed to provide the appropriate institutional framework to fight fraud and corruption.
As agreed, an Anti-Corruption Action Plan was first adopted by the Government and Parliament
in August 2009 and an Anti-corruption Law was promulgated by the President in September 2009.
Then, two structures were put in place, namely the Anti-corruption Commission and the
Corruption Observatory. Even though they were created in 2009, these institutions became
operational early in 2010, so had little impact on the perceived level of corruption during the
project. It was also expected that 80 percent of all measures included in the Anti-Corruption Plan
would be implemented per year, but only 11 out of the 28 measures programmed for 2010 were
effectively realized3. Nevertheless, both institutions were able to produce as expected their annual
report for the year 2010.

Since the activity materialized late in the project and achieved modest results the rating is
Moderately Satisfactory.

(ii) PFM Procedures and organizational strengthening. The project supported rationalizing,
streamlining and modernizing the systems and procedures governing the implementation and
execution of the budget. Four results were expected and largely obtained. First, the lag time in the


3
 According to the latest corruption inquiry conducted by FTHM Conseils as mandated by the Anti-
Corruption Commission and the Corruption Observatory („Enquête sur la Gouvernance en République du
Congo’, Octobre 2011).



                                                 12
launch of the budget preparation process was reduced as expected to less than two weeks from
legal deadlines. Secondly, the expenditure circuit was rationalized, hence contributing to an
improved execution rate of the budget and to a reduction of the level of deviation between
approved and executed budget. Thirdly, full budget reports were being prepared on a monthly
basis for the last two fiscal years. Finally, all procurement entities benefiting from state budget
funds prepared and published an annual procurement plan for both fiscal years 2010 and 2011.

The expenditure chain was successfully reformed to simplify procedures, reduce administrative
steps, and delegate functions/responsibilities to the sector managers. Hence the commitment
(l’engagement) and service delivery control (la liquidation) functions of the expenditure chain
were transferred from the Ministry of Finance to the sector ministries in charge of activities and
projects. It is now envisioned to also delegate responsibility for preparing the payment demands
(l’ordonnancement) to be sent to the Treasury for actual payments to goods and services
providers. Unfortunately, however, the accompanying new information technology is not yet in
place due to delays in the procurement and installation of software and hardware which, in turn,
are the consequence of delays in the approval of the computerization master plan (plan directeur
de l’informatique) and a budget shortfall following the higher than expected price quotations for
the goods and services needed to implement the desired system.

As a result, this sub-component is considered to be Satisfactory in view of its impact on the
effectiveness of administrative operations.

(iii) Computerization and reform of personnel files and wage system management. The overall
objective of this sub-component was not fully achieved and is still being pursued. Although
budget processes, including for wage bill expenditures, are increasingly transparent, more work is
required to meet the expected targets. Two distinct activities were supported: (i) computerization
of expenditure procedures in general and, more specifically, (ii) the reform of personnel files and
wage bill systems (which involves computerization both at the Ministry of Finance and the
Ministry in Charge of Civil Service).

Regarding the computerization and reform of expenditure management, it was expected that the
lag time between payment orders (ordonnancement) and actual payment to providers would be
reduced to less than 15 days. In reality, it remains quite difficult to monitor actual payments as
well as to ascertain the rationale behind the sequencing of actual payments by the Treasury
Department, so that the actual time lag becomes nearly impossible to measure for all payments
over a long enough period of time (fiscal year). Also, no statistics were maintained to measure the
reduction (by 25%) of the number of providers that were paid with a higher than average delay.
Overall, operations at the Treasury Department remain less transparent than expected.

The rating of this sub-component is considered to be moderately unsatisfactory given the delays
experienced implementing these activities, and the still opaque operations of the Treasury
Department.

As for the personnel files and wage bill systems, information available shows that the difference
between the number of personnel on record and actually paid is less than 5 percent. In fact, as
monitored and measured by the Ministry of Finance, the difference now stands at some 600




                                                13
persons4 out of a total civil service force of some 80,000 persons, which represents a less than 1
percent discrepancy. The Ministry of Finance conducted its own verification of staff on the
payroll, and the Ministry in charge of the Civil Service intends to do likewise to verify personnel
enlisted in the civil service and their location. The sub-component is thus far behind schedule.

In the specific case of personnel and wage bill data, though progress has been made , the rating
of this sub-component is moderately satisfactory given the delays experienced in the
implementation of these objectives, and the less than effective coordination between the Ministry
of Finance and the Ministry in charge of Civil Service.

(iv) Public investment management and procurement. Public investment management has been
strengthened. The public investment program was more in line with priorities outlined in the
PRSP during 2009 and 2010 fiscal years.

Public procurement institutions, procedures and systems have been reformed and in some cases
created. As expected, all contract award information related to public investments is now
published (including name of bidders, proposed offers, name and amount of the winning bid). All
92 sector procurement agencies prepared and published their contracting program (plan de
passation des marchés) for the year 2011. Furthermore, the regulations pertaining to competitive
bidding are broadly respected. It should be kept in mind, however, that the new procurement
system only began in 2010 so still requires adjustments and corrections. Indeed, some bottlenecks
and delays have complicated and retarded procurement operations in the 2010 and 2011 fiscal
years.

The rating of this sub-component is considered to be Satisfactory given its positive impact on
public investment management. This reform goes to the heart of transparency and governance
enhancement, the very “raison d’être? of the project. Yet only time and experience will show if
these newly introduced practices have been truly adopted and will endure.

(v) Public debt management strengthening. A brief mention has to be made about debt
management even if the issue is not referred to in the 2007 results matrix, given the fact that this
activity was largely completed before the project‟s restructuring. Training, software and hardware
were provided to the debt management unit of the Ministry of Finance, which opened the way for
the Government to update the UNCTAD debt management system it was then using, and thus
strengthen its mastery and control over this specific type of public expenditure.

This sub-component is considered to be Satisfactory in view of its positive impact on the
effectiveness of administrative operations.

(vi) Support to the General Auditing Office. This is another area of positive results which are not
captured in the Results Matrix, because the activity was conducted before project restructuring in
2007. Training, equipment, software and hardware were provided to the General Auditing Office
(Cour des Comptes) by the project. It should be noticed that this institution was created before the
inception of the project, but could not fulfill its mandate because it wasn‟t given any operational

 This information was provided by the General Director of Budget (Directeur Général du Budget) and
pertains only to controls conducted by the Ministry of Finance on its own files.



                                                14
means through the State‟s budget. Indeed, it only started operations after the project provided
resources for securing the office space, vehicle, equipment and material it needed.

This sub-component is considered to be Satisfactory in view of its positive impact on the oversight
and transparency of public finances.

3.2.3.3 Component 3: Transparency and Governance in the privatization process. This
component was dropped at the time of the restructuring of the project due to the slow pace of
progress, the lack of support from the Congolese authorities, and the need for the project to
concentrate its energies and resources on the main issues defining the HIPC agenda. Prior to this,
an inventory of public enterprise assets was conducted and studies and reforms were initiated at
the Centre des Formalités administratives des Entreprises. It should be noted that reforms and
activities in this domain have recently been revived in the context of the preparation of a new
project to promote private sector business.

Despite some positive accomplishments, the component can only be rated moderately
unsatisfactory given the fact that it had to be abandoned.

3.2.3.4 Component 4: Action-plan for Africa Region’s HIV/AIDS umbrella program 5 . The
action plan was prepared and delivered as planned. Furthermore, the quality of the product
provided is judged by the personnel of the Health Ministry as being of high quality. Indeed the
action plan served its purpose, which was to guide the stakeholders in the preparation and
approval of the national policy in regards to HIV/AIDS.

Given the positive assessment of the beneficiary regarding this activity, the component can be
rated as Satisfactory.

3.2.3.5 Component 5: Project management. The last component concerns support to and
performance of the Project Coordination Unit. As agreed upon in the project documents, annual if
not quarterly progress reports of satisfactory quality were submitted on time to the Congolese
authorities and the Bank. In most cases, the annual targeted outputs were produced as planned.
Except for specific issues and very limited periods, the ISR Implementation rating was considered
to be satisfactory.

As explained in greater details elsewhere in this report, the rating of this component is
Satisfactory.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Given the mixed results achieved, as described above, the overall rating of the project is
Moderately Satisfactory. This is the result of a Moderately Unsatisfactory rating for the first
phase of the project prior to restructuring, and a Moderately Satisfactory rating for the project
following restructuring when 70% of the total project expenditures were incurred. The project
clearly experienced serious delays which contributed to dropping a component after the mid-term

  Given that this is a Completion report, former component 3: Governance in the Privatization process as
well as component 4: The HIV/AIDS action plan are here re-integrated to the project even if they had been
left out of the restructured project as they were considered terminated or abandoned.

review. Several indicators did not attain the expected targets. Nevertheless, tangible and
important results were achieved with support from the project. Public procurement, corruption
containment, oil sector governance, strategic planning, and expenditure management for instance
were reformed and strengthened despite opposition to change from vested interests that was
encountered. Likewise, the challenges faced by the project were compounded by the direct link to
the HIPC agenda established at the time of restructuring.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

The project was able to maintain through its many activities and beneficiaries its focus on (i)
enhancing transparency and governance, (ii) reforming the institutional framework, and (iii)
providing capacity building as these issues represented the main problems facing the oil sector as
well as the Congolese public administration.

(a) Enhancing Transparency and Governance

The project was built upon the notion that corruption can be best fought and eventually reduced
by increasing the level of transparency and strengthening the governance practices of the public
administration. Accordingly, policies, regulations and institutions were established to insure
better transparency and governance in Congo.

The management of public revenues has been strengthened as transparency and governance were
indeed enhanced, in the oil sector to start with but also in the customs and tax departments.
Revenues are now more easily and precisely predicted, collected, monitored and controlled.
Information and data on public revenues, from the oil sector as well as from customs and taxes,
are more readily available to the public as a result of the publication of the relevant information
on official web sites or otherwise. However, transparency concerning revenues can still be
enhanced.

With project support, installation of computerized information systems was begun in the Ministry
of Finance as well as in the sector departments to maximize the accessibility and reliability of
data pertaining to public expenditures. Important delays were experienced in the implementation
of the systems and the diffusion of data, yet information pertaining to public expenditure is more
detailed and reliable today than was the case at the start of the project.

The new system and procedures put in place concerning public procurement of goods, works and
services has also enhanced transparency by permitting access to procurement information to all
interested parties.

(b) Institutional Framework Strengthening

While transparency and governance have been the overarching themes of the project,
strengthening the accompanying institutional apparatus has been another area of focus. Indeed,
anti-corruption structures have been set up and provided with equipment and training
opportunities with a view of effectively combating corruption. At the same time, a Corruption
Observatory was created to collect and analyze information pertaining to the situation and
evolution of corruption in the country.

The new procurement code was financed by the project and approved in April 2010. This code,
the implementation of which is still underway, has been conducive to improved transparency of
the procurement process, to building the capacity of local enterprises to bid on contracts, and has


                                                16
resulted in reduced costs of goods and services. The absence of a procurement code was
previously a major problem in RoC and sole sourcing was the only method used.

The management of public expenditures is more efficient and less cumbersome than it was at the
start of the project. The commitment and liquidation components of the expenditure circuit have
now been delegated to the sector managers. It is expected that in the near future the sector
managers will also be in charge of preparing the payment orders for goods and services received.
The paper work has thus been streamlined and the time needed to complete the procedures
shortened.

The strategic planning methods, practices and tools were extended and strengthened. That was
most notably the case with the long term strategy document (Congo 2025), sector policies and
strategies, the PRSP exercise and document, medium term expenditure frameworks, as well as
with public investment budgeting and programming. These exercises and products may still
require further improvement, but strategic planning is now generally better now in Congo than it
was at the beginning of the project.

(c) Capacity building

Capacity building has been a constant preoccupation on the part of the Congolese authorities.
Capacity was accordingly one of the main cross-cutting themes of the project. Indeed, the
institutional framework of public finances was enhanced and strengthened by, for instance, the
creation of agencies or services relating to public procurement and corruption In other areas, the
project also addressed the need to reform and strengthen ministries, departments or services as
was the case for instance for debt management, strategic planning and civil service management.
In parallel to institution creation or strengthening, the project supported the revision of existing
laws, and preparation of new laws, regulations, policies and procedures in the fields of public
procurement, transparency and governance, expenditure management, strategic planning, and
investment programming. The project also provided resources and services for the training of
hundreds of management and clerical staff members in the various administrative and technical
fields of economic planning and public finance.

(d) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

It was hoped that the expected increase in government revenues generated by the strengthening of
governance and transparency in the oil sector would allow increased allocation of resources in
priority sectors. The increase in the oil price and in production was such, though, that revenues
increased much more than expected, creating an opportunity for additional public investment.
Indeed, public investment budgets as well as expenditures increased substantially over the period
of the project, and possibly much more than the actual absorption capacity of the country.
Furthermore, investment credits and outlays increased even before project documents could be
appropriately prepared and sufficiently studied. This rapid increase in resources served only to
amplify an already serious problem in the management of public investment in Congo, namely
the weakness if not the inexistence of project planning including feasibility studies and other
analyses.

It could also be argued that the rapid and substantial increase in public revenues created increased
fragility of Congolese public finances. Government receipts remain highly dependent on oil
related fiscal revenues, so much so that a sudden fall in oil prices, could jeopardize not only the
health of public finances but the existence of some reforms initiated with support from the project.
Although the Government has set aside part of those additional revenues in a stabilization fund,


                                                17
the increase in disposable revenues means that any decrease in public expenditures becomes
difficult to achieve when and if a reduction of outlays is needed. Given a substantial fall in
revenues, a reduction in resources allocated to the new institutions created under the project could
occur. In the case of a return to a situation of scarce public resources, one can only imagine the
pressures that SNPC would face from powerful political authorities as well as from vested
interests.

Public investments would probably be the main victim of a worsening of the macroeconomic and
public finance conditions. The actual high number of projects and high volume of expenditure
would have to be reduced rapidly and substantially, probably once more leaving goods, works
and infrastructures incomplete. Again, the public investment program needs close monitoring
given this probability.

Being directly linked and associated to the HIPC agenda for the last three years, the project
benefited from the positive dynamics generated by the HIPC Completion Point agenda. But then,
as was anticipated, the project was affected by the reform fatigue that followed the completion
point in January of 2010. In fact, it can be said that the entire reform agenda is now stalled,
whether linked to the project or not.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

At the time of its preparation (2002) as well as during restructuring (2007), the risk rating for the
project was considered to be substantial. This report concludes that the risk to development
outcome of the project remains substantial.

Over-ambitious agenda. The reforms needed at the time of project preparation to put the Republic
of Congo back on the track of economic growth and poverty reduction were numerous, complex
and delicate. In addition, the HIPC agenda was ambitious and difficult. Resistance to reforms
could indeed be expected, especially regarding the governance and transparency objectives fixed in
the oil sector as well as in the public procurement system. Hence, successful implementation of the
project was always at risk. The linkage between the project and the HIPC agenda also posed both
important opportunities and risks of having both the policy dialogue and the technical assistance
going off track in parallel. This specific risk has been addressed in the follow up project as energies
and resources are more closely focused on fewer activities and implementation
agencies/beneficiaries.

Political risk. The project was at first designed in the context of the post-conflict situation. The
risk was thus high of seeing reforms as well as the project operations stalled because of political
turmoil and civil disturbances. Fortunately, political risks did not materialize as the political scene
remained calm, the administration resumed its operations and civil society enjoyed peace after
years of insecurity and violence. This risk is now considered to be low.

Implementation capacity risk. Weak institutional capacity represented a major challenge during
project implementation, and posed a serious threat to the project‟s efficiency and efficacy. In order
to overcome that risk, the project provided important support in terms of technical assistance and
institutional capacity building. Even if the project provided important resources devoted to training
and institutional reforms and reinforcement, the implementation and management capacities remain
weak, so that many results achieved with the project will remain at risk for some time to come.
This, in effect, is one justification to continue the capacity building efforts proposed under the
Bank‟s follow-up project.

Fiduciary risk. Risks posed by corruption remained strong throughout the project as the Republic
of Congo ranks among the most affected countries in international rankings. The risk was mitigated
by measures taken such as continued use of the PCU, and close monitoring and supervision of
activities. The fiduciary risk may not be as high as it was at the time of inception and
implementation of the project, yet it still remains important in spite of all the results obtained
related to transparency and governance. Reforms in the oil sector as well as those regarding the
public procurement system remain works in progress, and they could necessitate occasional
reinforcement, if not direct support.

The “lack of incentives? risk. The circumstances of the project changed dramatically during the
first years of the project. At the time of conception and early implementation of the project, the
Republic of Congo was experiencing problems of macroeconomic disequilibrium and public
finance deficits. By early 2004, however, the price of oil rose at a pace and to levels that were
beyond expectations, so much so that the economic and financial situation of the Congo quickly
improved. From struggling with a problem of deficit financing, the GoC came to confront the
challenge of managing a public finance surplus. Throughout the following years, the successful
implementation of the HIPC agenda brought another financial relief to the Congo with the
cancellation of a large part of its external debt. Both events had the same combined effect of
removing any necessity to maintain and extend reforms initiated and conducted under the HIPC

                                                  21
agenda and the project. Now the incentives for reforms and modernization in the oil sector and the
public administration are largely gone and the risk concerns not only the pursuit of reforms but also
the durability of those reforms. This risk therefore should be addressed in the design of the follow
up project.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

The Bank early on realized that the urgently needed reforms regarding the transparency and
governance of public affairs and finance management could only be addressed through a specific
institutional and human capacity building project. Furthermore, the Bank was right to see that
enhancing the conduct of public affairs necessarily started by improving transparency and
governance in the management of public finances. Once public finance management was
strengthened, especially revenue generation and collection, it was rightly assumed it would be
easier to finance as well as manage recurrent activities and investment projects intended to
rehabilitate and extend social services and basic infrastructures, and thus fight poverty.

However, the project design had flaws in terms of (i) evaluations of time and costs of hardware and
software procurement and installation, due to the scope and complexities of the full-fledged
computerization of the public finance system envisioned and; (ii) unrealistic expectations as
regards the time needed to initiate, implement and secure such delicate and difficult reforms as
public procurement and oil sector transparency and governance. If the complexity of these issues
was anticipated at the time of the project design, the local institutional and human capacity
available to conduct and implement those reforms was clearly overestimated.

(b) Quality of Supervision

The Bank provided good continuity both in team composition throughout the implementation
period and in regular interactions with the client, conducting some two dozen supervision missions
during project implementation. From an average of one mission per semester during the first phase
of the project, supervision missions were conducted on a quarterly basis at the time of the project
restructuring as well as during the final stretch of reforms and activities that led to the HIPC
completion point. During that period, the supervision of the project also gained in strength and
impact from the fact that the supervision missions of the project and the HIPC agenda were
conducted in combination and collaboration with other partners.

As noted by the Borrower, the new TTL based in the region (Kampala) close to the project
provided continuous support to the client and helped move the project forward. Supervision was
also enhanced by choosing as the subsequent TTL someone who not only was part of the team
from the time of its restructuring but who is based in Kinshasa. The Bank demonstrated flexibility
in its willingness to work proactively with the Government to find solutions and responses to the
requests made for project restructuring, extensions, and reallocations during implementation.

Except for occasional and brief periods of time, ISRs rated as satisfactory the progress toward
meeting the PDO and the IP throughout the life of the project. ISRs continuously revealed the
achievements and progress of activities on the ground.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

The Bank’s performance for quality at entry is rated as Moderately Satisfactory and supervision is
rated as Satisfactory giving an overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory.




                                                23
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

The Government was actively involved in the project preparation and quickly undertook the
necessary measures to set up the project monitoring entities: the Oversight Inter-ministerial
Committee (CIS), and Project Coordination Unit (PCU). It also agreed to provide the PCU with
autonomy in the financial management and administrative functions necessary for proper execution
of the project. The Government took all necessary measures to ensure that funds allocated to the
project were delivered as quickly as possible.

The project complied with the Bank fiduciary safeguards. Audit reports and Interim Financial
Reports (IFRs) were submitted to the Bank on time and there were no overdue audit reports or IFRs
at the time of the project closing date. All audit reports and IFRs were reviewed by the Bank and
comments provided to the Government. The last audit covering the period ending on October 31,
2011, is yet to be conducted.

On the negative side, the project suffered from a lack of direction and coordination as the CIS held
only one meeting during the life of the project. However, the Oversight Committee supervising the
Action Plan leading to the HIPC Completion Point also served as de facto oversight committee of
the TGCB project given the close links between the HIPC agenda and the TGCB project.

It should also be noted that the Government spent in the early years of the project more than FCFA
1 Billion (US$ 2 million) for studies and activities that were directly linked to the strengthening of
transparency in the Oil Sector Governance component, although this was not counted as a
contribution to the financing of the project. In addition, the Congolese Government contributed
USD 5.6 million to the financing of the restructured project from 2007-2010. More recently, the
Government granted the TGCB Project Coordinating Unit responsibility for procurement of goods
and services valued at FCFA 25 Billion (US$ 50 million). All these initiatives can only be
interpreted as a sign of goodwill and confidence towards the practices of the PCU.

The fact that the Government of Congo has agreed to fund 75 percent of the costs of the follow up
operation also indicates the Congolese authorities are satisfied by the organization and the
performance of the project. Also, the Government is committed to improve governance, conscious
of the fact that issues over natural resource management were the drivers of two highly damaging
civil conflicts in less than a decade.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

As for the implementing agencies themselves, some were able to achieve their objectives as
planned while others experienced difficulties and delays due to their lack of capacity and
experience, especially in connection to procurement of goods and services as well as control and
monitoring of expenditures.

The project included numerous activities involving nearly 30 different ministries. Lacking the
necessary oversight, direction and coordination, the project had difficulty addressing the needs and
constraints of all these agencies and providing effective coordination. In a project of such
importance and complexity regular coordination meetings, within the PCU and between the PCU
and its many implementing agencies were essential, along with effective preparation of meeting
agendas and meeting minutes to ensure focus and clarity in the coordination process. Unfortunately
these practices were lacking during most of the project‟s duration of nearly nine years.



                                                 24
In addition, such a project requires an effective and integrated internal system to monitor contracts,
expenditures and project activities and results. Though this was proposed more than once during
supervision missions limited progress was actually achieved in this respect and at the time of
project closing the various IT management systems in use at the PCU such as TOMMARCHE,
TECPRO, TOMPRO and SESAME were still not inter-connected, nor did the PCU have a
functioning LAN to facilitate communication between staff.

As mentioned earlier, efforts to create the project M&E system were started late in the project,
mainly because the M&E specialist was only hired at the time of restructuring. Furthermore,
linking of the project to the HIPC agenda complicated the M&E operations as the project was also
involved in monitoring the HIPC triggers. These factors therefore limited the effectiveness of the
PCU.

Generally it took much longer to implement project activities than was anticipated. With
computerization of public finances, for example, the planning of the operation was complicated by
the lack of interest and importance given to the computerization master plan (plan directeur de
l’informatique) by various stakeholders. The implementation agencies, as well as the PCU at times,
clearly underestimated the importance of the planning phase of specific reforms, and often gave the
impression of wanting to rush to the procurement of goods and services.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

If the performance of the Borrower could be considered Satisfactory during the final stretch
leading to the HIPC Completion Point phase, the overall performance rating during the life of the
project was Moderately Satisfactory, mainly because of the weakness of coordination and oversight
provided.




                                                 25
6. Lessons Learned

This project had two distinct phases, a first phase from 2003-2007 and a second phase, following
the restructuring of the project, when the project was explicitly linked to the implementation of the
HIPC agenda. There are important and distinct lessons to be drawn from each phase of this project
- about project design in a post-conflict context, about the effectiveness of project coordination and
the utility of a dedicated PIU, and about the impact of the authorizing environment at different
phases of the project, including the leveraging effect of the HIPC dialogue in phase 2.

Project Design: It is clear with hindsight that the original project design was excessively
ambitious, attempting to impact distinct and unrelated areas of government policy and management.
The project originally sought to achieve a range of individually difficult reforms such as:
privatization, public procurement, transparency in the oil sector, civil servants wage bill, integrated
public finance data management system. Since this problem of over-ambition at design stage is a
common observation in many ICRs across countries, we must seek the reason for this recurring
problem in the institutional incentives within the World Bank. In most countries, but particularly
in post-conflict situations, there are a very large number of critical needs and a compelling case can
be made for immediate attention to help resolve many of the institutional weaknesses. In this
context, there is tension between the strong culture of responsiveness to client needs from the
country management side of the matrix and the technical judgment of the sector side of the matrix
which would lean against broadening the focus of the project. The politics of this situation, both
within the government and within the Bank, creates strong demand side pressures to accommodate
diverse interests within the project. At the same time, there are reinforcing pressures from the
supply side. Increasingly, with budgetary and portfolio pressures dictating fewer projects, sectors
are under pressure to expand the scope of a project to address multiple problems within individual
projects. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that project designs typically attempt to
achieve multiple objectives and display the over-reach for which they are subsequently critiqued at
the evaluation stage. Unless this deep incentive issue is addressed at an institutional/regional level,
project designs are likely to repeat this problem.

Project Coordination: The implementation of the project rested on one Project Coordinating Unit
and close to thirty Project Executing Agencies. This created a distinct implementation challenge
since the institutional capacity for coordination was a weak point on the side of the borrower. This
is equally a design problem since the project should have better anticipated the capacity of the
borrower to coordinate and shore this up as much as possible. Another lesson learned is that a well
staffed PIU enabled effective technical implementation, particularly in phase 2 of the project.

Authorizing Environment: The second phase featured recognition of the potential of the project
to support a high priority agenda with political salience. As a result the project was restructured to
focus more narrowly on HIPC-related activities and it is quite clear to everybody, both in
government and among development partners, that the project achieved much stronger traction
once its design was linked to the HIPC agenda. The authorizing environment for the project was
fundamentally more supportive in the second phase. While there are very special circumstances
related to the political interest in debt cancellation which the HIPC process enabled, the lesson to
be learned is that projects must be linked to government objectives which are politically salient and
which will therefore provide the authorizing environment to support project implementation. The
presence and activism of a politically empowered supervising committee enabled decisions in a
timely manner.

Project Supervision: In response to the strong government interest, the Bank also strengthened its
project supervision arrangement - the HIPC and TGCB monitoring was for some time conducted
simultaneously by the same supervision missions ensuring effective project implementation. The

                                                 26
presence of a cluster leader in the region and a TTL based in Kinshasa enabled close support to
government in the second phase.


7. Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The main issue raised by the borrower as well as by the implementation agencies relates to the
necessity to secure the funds needed to complete those components and activities initiated through
the project that remained incomplete at project closing . Most importantly these include (i) the
personnel file management system for civil service employees and its link to the payroll system,
and (ii) the development and implementation of the public finance management system in line with
the agreed upon computerization master plan. Both of these will be included in the follow-on
project currently being prepared.

(b) Co-financiers/other donors

The main concern among other members of the donor community involved in the management of
public finances is the integrity and durability of reforms implemented during the process of the
HIPC Completion Point and the TGCB project. Their basic question is: Will the transparency and
governance gains obtained in the oil sector and the administration hold? What will happen if the
country experiences a sudden decrease in public revenues due to a fall of oil and gas prices?

(c) The Bank

It is worth adding the concern of the Bank on an issue that was raised and examined in the recent
Public Expenditure Review. Indeed, as the Development Objective and the Result Matrix of the
follow-up project clearly show, one the Bank‟s main concern at this time is the quality of the public
investment portfolio, the rationality of the project selection mechanism, and the completeness and
reliability of the monitoring system of investment outlays. This focus on public investments is
justified by the strategic importance of succeeding in effectively diversifying the Congolese
economy and, thus, the necessity of enhancing the efficiency and efficacy of public investment
management.

ANNEX 2: Project Description and Allocation of Additional Resources

The Government of the Republic of Congo has committed itself to the implementation of a
comprehensive Reform Plan, linked to the process of debt relief under HIPC. The actions foreseen
under HIPC have been scheduled over a period of two and a half to three years, starting in July
2006. The main underlying theme of the Reform Plan is improving the quality of governance, and
the main priorities in this regard are presented in Box 1, below.

The restructured and expanded „Transparency and Governance Capacity Building Project‟ (TGCB)
will provide support to key elements of the Action Plan and will ensure the sustainability of new
policies and procedures. The alignment of the TGCB with the Action Plan will enhance the impact
of project activities. While in the previous phase of the project a number of important activities
were delivered, in particular those related to oil sector governance and the auditing of the National
Oil Company, the overall impact of the project remained limited as an overall strategic framework
for reform of the governance system was lacking. The adoption of the HIPC Action Plan, following
the accession of the Republic of Congo to the HIPC Decision Point, has provided the Government
with a medium-term a strategic framework. Through the alignment of the project with the core
governance issues highlighted in the HIPC Action Plan, it will become an instrument to support the
Government in achieving one of its main priorities until the next Presidential elections, scheduled
for 2009. The project description below includes the proposed allocation of the additional financing
grant resources, as well as the Government contribution concerned.

The components and activities presented below have been designed in close cooperation with other
donors, in particular the EU (which supports actions related to external financial control and
accountability), the IMF (which supports ongoing work on budget classification and public
expenditure prioritization), the French Government (which supports a variety of actions on
governance, including on public investment management), the African Development Bank and the
United Nations Development Program. These are the main donors present in the Republic of
Congo.

Component 1: Strengthening Oil Sector Governance (US$ 2.6 million IDA, Government
contribution US$ 0.9 million).

Objective: to enhance predictability and transparency in the generation and management of oil
sector revenues so as to increase the Government‟s ability to effectively engage in medium term
budget planning.

Over the last three years the TGCB has supported a number of activities aiming at the improvement
of oil sector governance. These include the financing of annual audits of the SNPC, with the aim to
derive and implement an Action Plan for strengthening the management of the SNPC, the
certification of Oil Sector revenues transferred to the State Budget, and the enhancement of
capacity in the Ministry of Finance (through the creation of the Oil Sector Unit) to effectively
monitor revenues. It is generally agreed that these activities have contributed to the enhancement of
transparency on revenues (as they included public dissemination of the audit reports), as well as the
predictability of revenues. However, the activities funded so far have identified important strategic
weaknesses and inefficient procedures, and only partially addressed the deep governance problems
in the oil sector in Congo. Following discussions with the authorities, the following six priority
activities are proposed for further financing; i) continuation of the audit and certification activities
already initiated under TGCB; ii) creation of an integrated oil sector data bank to strengthen
management and transparency in the oil sector; iii) strengthening capacity in the Oil Sector
Monitoring Unit in the Ministry of Finance, Economy and the Budget; iv) enhancing civil society
oversight through the activities of the EITI consultative and executive committees; v) support for

                                                  31
the implementation of recommendations of HIPC-related studies concerning oil marketing
practices, the valuation of assets of the former state oil firm, Hydrocongo, and the reform of the
SNPC‟s accounting system, and; vi) design a medium-term sector strategy that will permit a
coherent implementation of the recommendations coming from audits and studies under a longer
term vision for the sector.

Activity 1: Continuation of SNPC audits and oil revenue certifications (US$ 0.45 Million).

This activity will finance the continuation of the annual audit of the SNPC and the quarterly
certification of transfers of oil sector revenues to the State Treasury. It will finance the audits for
2007 and 2008 and the certifications for the budget years 2007 (second semester), 2008 and the
first half of 2009.

Activity 2: Conceptualization and implementation of a sector data bank and an open information
system for the oil sector (US$ 1.5 million).

To ensure consistency and transparency of available data on oil sector management, and modernize
the management of the sector, it is proposed that a centralized oil sector data bank will be created,
with different levels of accessibility for the general public, oil sector companies and government
institutions. This is good practice in most oil producing states, and will be a precondition for the
future computerization of the modeling of oil reserves, the bidding process on issuing concessions
and other aspects of oil sector management. The proposed database will build up on existing SNPC
data will up on existing SNPC data bank, adding sector economic information and procedures for
accessing information under interlinks with all concerned government agencies.

Activity 3: Strengthening the capacity of the oil sector monitoring unit in the Ministry of Finance
and the DGH (US$ 0.50 million).

This activity will finance equipment and training for the staff of the Oil Sector Monitoring Unit in
the Ministry of Finance and the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH). As regards the
provision of equipment, this will be based on the needs assessment previously conducted under the
TGCB, and which World Bank experts have verified.
As regards training, this will include: (i) the development of a tailor-made training program for the
staff of the unit, based on a training needs assessment to be conducted, and (ii) the implementation
of a training of trainers program.

Activity 4: Independent oversight of oil sector governance (US$ 0.4 million).

In 2005 Congo joined the EITI initiative, as an expression of its commitment to enhance
transparency in oil sector governance. In October 2006, the Government created a consultative and
an executive committee, which will became operational in 2007. The project will support selected
EITI executive committee activities aimed at promoting oversight of natural resource extraction.
The development of the EITI will involve a number of training activities to increase the knowledge
of government and civil society representatives on basic aspects of the oil sector in the Republic of
Congo.

Activity 5: Support the implementation of measures to improve the sector performance, in
particular those recommended by the HIPC related oil sector audits and studies
(US$ 0.45 million).
The HIPC Action Plan includes four of the remaining actions that resulted from the first audit of
the SNPC, conducted in 2004, in particular:


                                                  32
       Modeling oil reserves and future revenues in order to estimate the impact of current
        revenue repartition mechanisms;
       Reform of the accounting system of the SNPC;
       Valorization of oil titles held by the SNPC;
       Improvement in oil marketing practices to ensure that Congolese oil is sold at the best
        possible price for the country.
Studies related to the above actions have been initiated under government financing under a
cooperation agreement with the Bank, which provides substantive oversight over the conduct of the
studies. It is proposed that follow up activities to the recommendations resulting from the studies
listed above will be provided under the TGCB.

Activity 6: Design of an oil sector strategy (US$ 0.2 million).

This will be a collaborative effort between the World Bank experts, government officials of the
Ministry and Finance and experts selected by the Government to draw up a medium and long term
strategy for the development of the oil sector in Congo, including key aspects of its governance. As
for the data bank, whereas this activity is not directly linked to a HIPC condition, it is important to
note that without the consolidated data and without a coherent sector strategy, the
recommendations of earlier audits and studies will not be implemented in a sustainable way.

Component 2: Enhancing governance capacity: anti-corruption, public financial
management, public procurement and public investment management (US$ l0.85 million IDA,
government contribution US$ 4.65 million)

Objective: To strengthen structures and programs to reduce level of corruption and to enhance
effectiveness and transparency in key aspects of public financial management.

The second project component will assist the Government in addressing selected aspects of the
governance reform agenda, with an emphasis on measures that enhance transparency and
accountability. The component will have four sub-components, each focusing on key measures
identified in the HIPC Action Plan.

Sub-component A.: Strengthening anti-corruption structures (US$ l.6 million).

Under the HIPC Action Plan, the Government has undertaken to restructure and strengthen
structures that will define and implement the government‟s policies to reduce corruption, as well as
to provide external oversight. On the first issue, the Anti-corruption Commission has been
transformed into an internal coordination structure that will ensure the implementation of the future
Anti-Corruption Action Plan. On the second issue, the Anti-Corruption Observatory is in the
process of being created. The Observatory is an independent institution that will monitor and
evaluate the implementation of Government anti-corruption measures as well as undertake
diagnostic studies and surveys to track progress in the fight against corruption. The project will
provide support to both structures.

Activity 1: Capacity building and support for the Observatory (US$ 0.9million).

The Observatory has been tasked with a number of a crucial tasks related to the oversight of
Government actions to reduce levels of corruption, with a particular emphasis on specific elements
of the HIPC Action Plan. The project will finance expert support required by the Observatory to
implement its responsibilities related to areas such as procurement, public investment management,

                                                  33
public financial management, etc. In addition to providing expert support to activities already
defined under the HIPC action plan, the project will also finance expert support to the Observatory
to the development of the medium term Anti-Corruption Action Plan, which will be produced
based on the diagnostic study on Governance, financed under current activities under TGCB.

In addition to providing expert support, the project will also finance two members of the Secretariat
of the Observatory, who will assist the Observatory in its substantive work. This financing comes
in addition to the funding already allocated by the Government for the operation of the Secretariat.

Activity 2: Capacity building and support for the Anti-Corruption Commission (US$O.7 million).

The project will finance expert support to the Commission to strengthen its capacity to coordinate
the implementation of measures included in the Anti-Corruption Action Plan. This will include
training for members of the Commission as well as capacity building measures for its secretariat,
the staff of which will be Government civil servants. The activity will also finance sensitization
activities related to the implementation of the Anti-corruption Action Plan, as well as an
international expert to support the Commission in the development of an Anti-Corruption Law.

Sub-component B: Strengthening Management, Organization and Procedures in Public Financial
Management (US$ 2.836 million).

This is one of the core components of the project, as it addresses several key elements of the HIPC
Action Plan, in particular streamlining budget management, strengthening the organization of the
system of the Ministry of Economy, Finance and the Budget (MFEB), as well as of the Ministry of
Public Administration (which is required to address problems with wage bill management
involving this ministry) and building capacity to support the introduction of the Medium Term
Budget Planning System. The combination of activities discussed below will ensure that
transparency in budget management is enhanced and that budget resources are planned and
executed in line with the priorities defined in the PRSP.

Project Activities are based on the agreed Public Financial Management Action Plan, which was
designed by the Government with the support of the World Bank and the European Union.

Activity 1: Streamlining budget management procedures (US$ 0.816 million).

This activity is at the core of the project. Without the implementation of measures to strengthen
public financial management procedures and the organizational structure and management of the
MFEB, the objectives set out in the HIPC Action Plan are unlikely to be achieved. Based on the
recent Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) and Country Integrated Fiduciary
Assessment (CIFA) reports, which include an in-depth diagnostic of current budget planning and
execution, procedures are complex and convoluted, creating significant scope for corruption and
abuse of public resources. In addition they are not conducive to the implementation of a strategic
approach to public expenditure management.

MFEB has requested support to help addressing these findings, which are included in the PFM
Action Plan. The activities foreseen will support both the MFEB and the Ministry of Planning and
Territorial Administration (MPAT).

The project will provide expert support to design and implement measures to address the main
shortfalls in the current budget planning and execution procedures (chaîne des dépenses), focusing
on introducing Medium Term Budget Planning, improving procedures for the commitment and
execution of approved budget allocations, as well as provide support in reforming public sector

                                                 34
accounting methods and wage bill planning and execution. Finally, the project will finance
advisory activities aimed at identifying possibilities for the simplification of budget management
procedures and supporting their application.

The project will focus primarily on budget planning issues, as other elements of the budget
management system, in particular budget execution and external oversight, are supported by the
EU, BAD and the French Government.

Activity 2: Improving organization and management in the Ministry of Economy, Finance and
Budget and the Ministry of Public Administration (US$1.27Million).

This activity is closely linked to the previous one, but will focus on organization and management
aspects of public financial management, including the management of personnel, as this constitutes
more than 20 percent of public expenditure and has important implications for the delivery of
services in key areas such as health and education.

The project will finance a comprehensive organizational audit of the MFEB (Budget Department,
Finance Department), as well as its subordinated structures (Customs, Tax Administrations,
Treasury, Financial Inspectorate), and will subsequently, based on the decision of the Minister,
finance expert support in the re-definition of organizational structures, accountability and reporting
relations between institutions in the system of the MFEB, and support the re-definition and
classification of posts. The organizational audit of the MFEB will be conducted after the analysis of
the budget management process will be completed and decisions on the reorganization of budget
management processes will be taken.

The same review process will be conducted for the Ministry of Public Administration, which plays
a pivotal role in the administration of the whole public service, including education, health, etc.,
and constitutes, together with the MFEB, the main pillars of horizontal management in the Public
Administration system of the Republic of Congo. The Ministry of Public Administration will also
conduct an organizational audit, and subsequently reorganize its structures, and job classification
system.

The Government has also expressed an interest in conducting a full organizational review of the
Public Administration system, but this is beyond the scope of this project. However, the
methodologies defined and tested at the MFEB and the MPAA would serve as a good basis for the
Government to undertake such review work for other ministries at a later stage.

Activity 3: Strengthening training capacity (US$ 0.75 million).

This activity will provide support to the MFEB in the development and implementation of training
programs that will help enhance budget management capacity. The Ministry wishes to create a
local training center to reduce its current dependence on expensive foreign training programs.
Particular training needs identified include:

       The Medium Term Budget Planning process;
       Public accounting (especially for line ministry finance units);
       Using IT systems (related to sub-component C);
       Budget classification.



                                                 35
The project will finance training equipment for the center, as well as support in course design,
training of trainers programs and the piloting of training courses.

Sub-component C: Computerization of Public Financial Management, including wage bill
management (US$ 8.82 million).

This sub-component mainly aims to enhance transparency in the budget management process
(whereas the above sub-component B will help enhance effectiveness). Based on the actions to
ensure the simplification and streamlining of budget procedures and administrative organization,
the Government has also requested support in the computerization of the budget planning and
implementation process.

The initial design of the computerization process was conducted in the previous phase of the TGCB,
under a contract executed by an international consultant firm. The World Bank has reviewed the
assessment and design work conducted and concluded that it provides a good basis to proceed with
the computerization process, provided two conditions are fulfilled:

        a. The development of an IT Master Plan.
        b. Reviewing budget management structures and procedures to ensure that the
        maximum impact of computerization will be achieved.

The IT Master Plan will be adopted by May, 2007, following discussions with the World Bank in
November 2006 and January 2007. Work on the simplification and rationalization of budget
management procedures and administrative organization will be initiated under sub-component B.

The computerization process will have two main blocs of activity.

Activity 1: Networking key ministries and supporting the Computerization of the budget process
(US$ 7.22 million).

This activity will finance the supply and installation of equipment to network the main ministries
based in Brazzaville, based on a fiber-optic network. This will ensure that all main budget users
will be connected to the MFEB, thus facilitating significantly the budget planning and
implementation process including the accounting and financial reporting system, as well provide
the basis for the implementation of the activities on personnel management and procurement
presented below.

In addition, based on the findings of the inventory of the Government IT system, the government
will purchase required software packages to support the budget management process and the
accounting and financial reporting system. The support will aim to bridge existing gaps in
connectivity between the main departments of the Ministry of Finance, including the Treasury, the
Customs and the Tax Administration, as well as link up the main budget users (health, education,
planning, Grands Travaux, etc.) with the Ministry to ensure the availability of on time budget
information to these institutions. This activity will lead to the implementation of a strong and
effective accounting and financial reporting system connected to the computerized budget
execution procedures. Training will be provided for all budget and accountant users in using IT
tools as part of the supply and installation process.

Activity 2: Harmonization of personnel records and the development of an integrated personnel
data system (US$ l.6 million).



                                               36
Data on public service employees are currently based both at the MFEB, at the MPA and at line
ministries, and there is no consistency in the substance and form of personnel databases. Regardless
of a census of staff conducted in 2005, little progress has been made on the development of a
unified personnel management and wage bill system, which poses significant risks of abuse of
public funds. The main reason for this is the dilapidated state of public service records held at the
MPA, which, if not addressed urgently, is likely to lead in the short term to a loss of key data on
personnel records. Personnel expenditure makes up more than 20 percent of public expenditure. In
addition, the ability of the state to recruit and field qualified staff, in particular in the areas of health
and education is a key condition for meeting PRSP and MDG goals, and, for education, an element
of the HIPC Action Plan. Thus, ensuring the development of a single database (register) for public
service staff, which would serve both the MFEB and the MPA (as the principal repository of all
personnel files) is considered a priority issue for the Republic of Congo, as confirmed both by the
Budget Department at the MFEB and the Cabinet of the MPA.

Based on the above consideration, the project will therefore finance advisory services and training
related to the design and implementation of a unified register for personnel records. This will be
based on the already installed HR Payroll system, which will link the Ministries of Public
Administration and Finance. Apart from training and advisory services, which are essential to
ensure that fragmented existing manual records are effectively transferred into a coherent database
that can serve both wage bill and personnel management, the project will also, once the initial work
on the personnel files system is completed, finance the linkage between the database and the
pension and social security administrations, which is essential to develop a fully functional system.

Sub-component D: Strengthening capacity in procurement and public investment management
(US$ 2.29 Million).

Strengthening public procurement and public investment management systems are two of the key
priorities in the HIPC Action Plan, and closely related to each other. Therefore activities related to
both areas are combined under this component.

Activity 1: Public procurement reform implementation (US$ l.2 million).

This activity will include two main elements, both of which build on activities already initiated
under TGCB. In 2006-2007 TGCB has funded expert support and training on the development of
the new legal and institutional framework for public procurement. Based on the new legislation and
management system, two further interventions will be funded which will help the Government in
completing its new procurement system.

        a. Design and installation of a procurement tracking system (US$ 1.0 million).

The project will finance the supply and installation of this system, which will help ensure that the
provisions of new procurement legislation will be properly applied. The system will facilitate the
design of bidding documents, tracking procurement processes, in particular for large procurement
packages, keep track of bidding records, including the centralization of information on contractors,
etc. The installation of this system would enhance the possibility to significantly increase
transparency in the management of public procurement.

        b. Expertise on the implementation of new procurement legislation (US$ 0.2 million).

The project will finance expert support required for follow up activities related to the
implementation of new procurement legislation and practices. The exact nature of this expert
support will be defined in the course of the project, once new legislation will have been adopted.

                                                    37
Activity 2: Strengthening public investment management (US$ l.094 million).

The current public investment management system in the Republic of Congo is highly inefficient,
and does not provide the right checks and balances to ensure that public investment is pro-poor and
in line with the priorities outlined in the PRSP. Project design and management are weak, leading
to low delivery rate on projects and waste of public resources. Improvements in project definition,
design, and impact assessment are therefore essential if the Republic of Congo is to make effective
use of the budgetary surpluses generated by increasing oil revenues.

In view of this, the project will finance two related sets of activities.

        a. Capacity building activities.

The project will finance expert support to implement the provisions of the HIPC Action Plan
related to the improvement of public investment management. This would include financing for
capacity building for the Ministry of Planning, Economic Integration and the NEPAD (The New
Partnership for Africa‟s Development), to enable this institution to better coordinate the design and
implementation of the Public Investment Program (PIP) and to monitor and evaluate its
implementation. This activity will also include financing for expert support to sector ministries in
the elaboration of sector strategies related to the development of the Medium Term Expenditure
Framework. The project will finance training on project design and project management for
officials of the Ministry of Planning, Economic Integration and the NEPAD as well as of officials
in main spending ministries, in particular those related to transport, infrastructure and the social
sectors.

        b. Project Analysis Fund.

To improve the quality of the PIP, the activity will establish a project analysis fund to be managed
by the Ministry of Planning, Economic Integration and the NEPAD. This fund will assist sector
ministries by financing expert support to undertake project feasibility studies for any project of
which the estimated cost is higher than US$ 100.000. The fund will also finance relevant economic
sector work for sector ministries.

Component 3: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 1.55 million).

The objective of this component is to ensure that the project is managed in an effective and
transparent manner, as well as to conduct monitoring and evaluation of project performance.

Activity 1: Project management.

This activity will finance the salary and operational cost of the staff of the project implementation
unit. The existing Project Coordination Unit has the required capacity to perform procurement and
financial management functions as well as to support the implementing agencies of the project. The
TGCB has been consistently rated „Satisfactory‟. Thus, its operation will be continued under the
restructured project.

Activity 2: Monitoring and Evaluation.

Monitoring and evaluation activities have been funded so far by a PHRD implementation grant. An
extension of this grant, to cover the remaining duration of the project, has been secured, which
limits financing needs in this regard, though some funding for expert support is foreseen to secure
the continuity of activities once PHRD resources will be fully used.

Introduction

This present Government‟s report on the completion of the Transparency and Governance Capacity
Building, Project at June 30, 2011 shows the outline of the documents and reports already prepared
by the Project Implementation Unit

     A. Project Objectives
The objective of the first phase (IDA Credit-3600) of TGCBP was to support the Post-conflict
Economic Recovery Program initiated by the Government, with the objectives (i) to increase
transparency and good governance in the hydrocarbon sector, the financial administration, the
procurement system and expenditure chain, while (ii) initiating the process of disengagement of the
state on the productive sector of the economy with emphasis on privatization and development of
the private sector. The second phase (IDA grant-H288) has refocused the efforts of the project on
the action plan that should lead to HIPC completion point. The Project Development Objectives
become, to increase the transparency, governance and efficiency in the management of public
finances, including the oil sector.

C. Performances Achieved

C 1. IDA supervising of activities task Performance

The project has been more supervision missions to achieve results. As appropriate, the supervision
missions have made bi-monthly or quarterly. These missions have enabled memory aids to help
shape and / or accelerate the level of project activities and action plans for implementing the
recommendations of these missions.

C 2. Government Performance on supervision of project activities

The Government has made: (i) the ratification of the Credit Agreements and Grants as well as the
implementation of conditionality enforcement of financing requested, (ii) preparation of records of
technical meetings, journals and audit mid-term review, (iii) the appointment of coordinators and
staff recruitment specialist and implementation of the UEP (iv) soliciting additional resources and /
or extension of the dates of implementation of activities; ( v) validation of documentary media
towards government agencies and project implementation.

C 3. Project Implementation Agencies Performance

The performance of the Project Implementing Agencies have improved as their information,
awareness and capacity building on topics in which they were concern. With the support of
international consultants made available to the AEP they have developed expertise in the topics
from the management of CDMT in the implementation of the Procurement Code, in governance
and anti-culture Corruption (OAC and CNLCCF) not to mention transparency in public
procurement, audits and studies in the hydrocarbons sector (CRS Cell hydrocarbons, ... EITI),
which are published in various websites of the Government and its institutions.

C 4. UEP Performance

In addition to the above results indicated, the following intermediate outcomes were achieved: (i)
capacity building project members, (ii) the annual allocation of resources for the implementation of
activities, (iii) the renewal of the computer and networking system for data management of the
UEP / TGCB and improve labor productivity. In addition, the unit project was to (i) the execution
of procurement plans (84 contracts on credit-COB 3600 and Don TF 053 314, and 123 contracts on
the Don H288-COB) (ii) the preparation of the financial Monitoring reports (RSF), and (iii) the
production of analytical reports quarterly (RAT), and (iv) the internal audit reports and financial
fixed assets from 2003 to 2011

Finally, it is fitting to emphasize strongly that the instrument was TGCB capital that support the
Government in implementing reforms that allowed the Congo to reach the completion point under
the HIPC Initiative in January 2010.

Annex 4. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners


The following comments were collected during visits to local representatives of these donors in
Brazzaville during the fact finding mission conducted to prepare this completion report and, thus,
are not a reaction to the content of this report.

IMF

The IMF is worried about the actual state of affairs in Congo. Although the rhythm and pace of
reforms introduced and implemented throughout the HIPC agenda was impressive, little has
occurred since the completion point was reached in early 2010. All incentive for reforms and
achievements seems to have vanished. Appropriation by the government of the intent and content
of the project as well as the ownership of the reforms conducted under the HIPC agenda and the
TGCB project have to be questioned.. Given the actual institutional inertia and lack of interest for
reform from public officials, donors should appeal to the high political authorities of the country so
that a mutual understanding can be reached as to the content of the medium-term agenda. In the
absence of such a political stance, donor‟s energies and resources will probably be wasted in vain
reform attempts. Finally, the IMF regrets that nothing substantive is done actually to prepare for an
eventual change of economic prospects in the event of a fall in oil and gas prices. Congo could now
benefit from the window of opportunity offered by its large fiscal revenues resulting from high oil
and gas prices to address, before it is too late, the risk posed by the level of fragility of its public
finances and the unbalanced pattern of its economic growth.

UNDP

UNDP activities in the Republic of Congo that relate to the TGCB‟s objective and activities are
limited to the second component of the project, and especially those activities regarding economic
planning and public investment management. Other than the PIP preparation and execution, UNDP
has been involved in the DSRP, CDMT and long term vision work (Condo 2025). UNDP was at
one point also providing expertise and training related to results-based management. As for the
other components of the project, UNDP clearly supports initiatives regarding enhancing
transparency and governance of public affairs and finances. Reform of public procurement was a
necessary and important chapter of Congo‟s reform program. Yet, whatever their actual
implementation status, these reforms remain fragile, and will need to be closely monitored and
eventually supported, if necessary. One important risk in this regard relates to the fact that capacity
building often fails to achieve the expected results since managers and personnel trained often are
not assigned to jobs related their training and, also, because managers are still assigned to positions
and functions for which they have no training while other qualified people are available.
Institutional framework and capacity building will remain for some time the backbone of
effectiveness and efficiency of the public sector. Finally, UNDP takes the opportunity to reassert its
conviction that dialogue and coordination between donors is the basis of a coherent and effective
external aid and assistance program.


European Union

The European Union is and intends to stay involved in the area of PFM. , namely in matters
relating to: (i) strategic planning, through a forthcoming assistance to the development of sectorial
strategies, (ii) transparency and control, by way of training and assistance to most institutions and
services involved in public finance management, and (iii) technical support to the customs
department (Direction Générale des Douanes). While the European Union and the Bank both
                                                  42
intervened in the area of public finance management, each institution was acting on its own on
stand-alone activities as opposed to co-financed activities. The representative of the European
Union interviewed (who has been in Brazzaville for most if not all of the last three years of the
project) stated that the project‟s objectives and activities were relevant and important. Yet, the
European Union, as many other donors, is concerned by some of the recent actions taken by the
GoC, including concerning the proposed reform of the public procurement code. The fact that the
administration and the SNPC do not post on the web the information and data they published in
recent years constitutes a change of attitude that can only raise questions on the durability of recent
reforms. Finally, the interviewee expressed the European Union‟s satisfaction regarding the quality
and regularity of cooperation that the Bank showed, both in connection to the project and the HIPC
agenda.

France

By providing technical assistance and resources to the Ministry of Planning, France was
instrumental in the strengthening and enhancing of public investment management (2006-2011).
Not only did French cooperation provide much needed capacity building support to modernize and
reform public investment management but France, in so doing, was instrumental in helping the
Government of Congo meet the HIPC Action Plan conditions and triggers associated with public
investment management. France provided resources and assistance in order first to prepare the
Action Plan to Enhance the Management of Public Investment (PAAGIP: Plan d’Actions pour
l’Amélioration de la Gestion des Investissements Publics), and second to implement the measures
included in that plan. More specifically, the French assistance helped strengthen (i) the institutional
framework and the policy content of sector strategies, (ii) the institutional framework and
methodology and procedures of the Directions des Affaires Administratives et Financières (DAAF)
and the Directions des Études et de la Planification (DEP) in the sector ministries, (iii) project
identification, analysis and selection, (iv) public investment expenditures control, monitoring,
reporting and evaluation. French sponsored capacity building at the level of the Ministry of
Planning also contributed to important cross ministerial reforms such as (i) public procurement
systems and procedures revision, (ii) public expenditure administrative circuit streamlining, and
(iii) medium term public expenditure frameworks introduction.
