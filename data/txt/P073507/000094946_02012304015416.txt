I.            COUNTRY BACKGROUND
1.    Following independence in 1960, nearly three decades of centrally planned
government, and almost one decade of conflict and continuous political strife (including
three presidential coups and one presidential assassination), left the Republic of Congo
politically tormented and performing economically well below its development potential.
2.    The economy of the country is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts, an
industrial sector based largely on oil, support services, and a government characterized by
a bloated bureaucracy with recurrent budget cash-management issues. With a GNP per
capita of US$630 in 2000, the Republic of Congo ranks 12th amongst all Sub-Saharan
African countries. Oil, which accounts for more than half of the country's GDP, has
supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy. Large-scale investment but low-return
projects financed by high oil prices in the 1970s could only be sustained subsequently
through heavy borrowings. In the late 1980s, lower oil prices, fiscal imbalances and
misalignment of the FCFA led to substantial economic decline.
3.   In the mid-1990s, government's efforts to promote economic relief and
stabilization were hampered by two civil wars. The Congolese economy was on the verge
of stabilization when yet a third war erupted in 1998 with dramatic social, economic and
institutional capacity effects as over 800,000 Congolese, nearly 30% of the population, fled
their homes during the 1988-1999 conflict.
4.    Following the cessation of hostilities in November 1999, the Government of Congo
initiated the peace process with very little international assistance. The re-establishment of
most of the people who were displaced during the war has already been accomplished.
GoC is now committed to continuing the ongoing dialogue with all political parties. A
referendum for a new Constitution is to take place soon and general elections for the
Presidency and Parliament are scheduled for 2002.
II.   SECTOR AND PROJECT BACKGROUND
5.    Detailed information on the Congolese public sector environment (oil and gas
industry, resources other than petroleum, privatization program and partnership among
government, civil society and private sector) and sector issues to be addressed by the
proposed project and strategic choices are provided in Appendix 2.
6.    Economic rehabilitation will be difficult. Indeed, mismanagement of the economy
and war have left the country heavily indebted, half of agricultural tools destroyed, 75% of
livestock lost, insufficient and insecure urban and rural infrastructure and basic services,
lack of appropriate health and education facilities, a high unemployment rate, a bankrupt
financial system and less-than-satisfactory management of natural resources, particularly
oil and forestry.
7.    GoC's economic program, presented in its Three-year Interim Post-Conflict
Program for the period 2000-2002, is built on a reform agenda that includes: pursuit of



2
sound macroeconomic policies and stabilization measures, particularly in the fields of
public finance management; pursuit of the privatization program, improvement of
governance, accountability and transparency, and improvement of the business regulatory
framework.
8.    Progress is underway on several fronts. Public finances are being rationalized
through the launching of a computerized expenditure control system and measures to
enhance revenue collection of the customs administration and the Treasury. The salary
levels of civil servants have been frozen, and recruitment, except in health and education,
has been suspended. Important reforms are also being introduced in the financial sector
under the general umbrella of the government's privatization programn.
9.    Moving to a market economy requires simultaneous transitions on several fronts.
New laws or regulations are required in nearly every sector, including forestry, labor
relations, mining, telecommunications, energy and water. A new investment charter based
on the CEMAC regional investment chart and drafted after broad-based consultations with
both the private and public sectors will soon be approved by the Government.
III.  PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION SUMMARY
10.   Project Development Objectives: The primary project development objective is to
increase efficiency of: (i) petroleurn operations; (ii) MoEFB's financial operations; and
(iii) Government's public enterprise reform and privatization process. The proposed
project is an integral part of the reform action program supported under the Post-Conflict
Economic Rehabilitation Credit.
11.   The Project will address comprehensively the issue of transparency in the decision-
making processes of the government and its agencies, assigning a high priority to the
management and control of oil resources and state budgetary expenditure processes,
including public procurement. The project will also be instrumental in achieving greater
transparency of government's disengagement from productive activities in the economy, as
it will help strengthen the Privatization Committee, help draft the implementation decrees
permitting greater participation of the private sectors in the ownership and management of
utilities. Finally, the project will help design an action plan for (i) strengthening
partnership and dialogue among government, the private sector and civil society, and (ii)
HIV/AIDS activities.
12.   Project Description Summary: To achieve the project development objectives,
the proposed project would have four components:



3
Component 1: Increasing transparency and improving the governance of oil and gas
operations:
The project would provide local and foreign technical assistance, training and some
equipment to improve Government's capacity to establish effective operational and fiscal
control over the sector. This component would be carried out in two phases; (i) the first
phase would concentrate on designing an action plan, based on results from the assessment
and operational audit of the sector; (ii) the second phase would help MoEFB, MoHy and
SNPC implement recommendations and activities scheduled during Phase 1.
Component 2: Increasing transparency and improving the governance of non-oil and gas
operations:
The project would further increase transparency and improve the governance of
decision-making in the MoEFB and its agencies by procuring technical assistance, some
equipment and training for: (a) improving its three high-priority areas: (i) strategic
planning, national statistics and public accounting, (ii) financial controls of the State and,
(iii) resources mobilization; (b) a thorough review of the Central Commission for Public
Contracts and strengthening of the Direction Centrale des Marches et Contrats d'Etat
(DCMCE); and (c) strengthening the capacity of the Cour des Comptes.
Component 3: Increasing transparency and improving the governance of the
privatization process:
The project would support the Borrower's public enterprise reform and
privatization process by providing technical assistance, training and some equipment to: (i)
strengthen the Privatization Committee and clarify the regulatory framework of the private
sector; (ii) enhance the capacity of the Centre de Formalites des Entreprises (CFE) for the
promotion of private investments in the country, (iii) assess the Centre National de Gestion
(CENAGES's) strengths and weaknesses and provide recommendations on the future
status of the company; and (iv) strengthen the dialogue and partnership among
Government, civil society and the private sector.
Component 4: Designing an action plan for the Africa Region's HIV/AIDS umbrella
program:
The project would support the Borrower's efforts to design an overall strategy and
action plan for the regional HIV/AIDS regional umbrella program financed by the Bank.
13.   Appendix 2 provides a detailed description of each component's activities and the
background of the related public sector environment.
IV.  PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
14.   The total cost of the proposed project is US$10.82 million. IDA financing is
estimated at US$7.0 million (65%). It is expected that the African Development Bank



4
(ADB) would finance about US$1.64 million, mostly on non-oil operations. The Agence
Franqaise de Developpement (AFD,) has already agreed to finance up to US$857,000 of
technical assistance  to  the  MoEFB, mostly  for budget administration  and  public
expenditure control activities. A 'Project Preparation Facility (PPF), in the amount of
US$700,000, will help government finalize project preparation and set up the Project
Coordination Unit. The credit will reixoactively finance expenses in an amount not exceeding
SDR 50,000 equivalent for expenses incurred after the pre-appraisal mission in July 2001.
15.    Project Costs:   The  costs of the project's components (see  Schedule  A  for
Estimated Project Costs) are set out in the table below:

V.   PROJECT INSTITUTIONAL AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
16.    The proposed project is planned to be implemented over a five-year period; its
implementation, as adopted by GDC, would be guided by principles set out in the
performance improvement framework, and would reflect options for participation of the
public sector, civil society organizations, and the donor community.

Project Coordination and Management
17.   The project manager will be the Director of Cabinet of the Minister of Economy,
Finance and Budget. He will be assisted by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) that reports
to him and which will administer and coordinate project activities on a daily basis and be
responsible for the project's financial management. This Unit will be financed by the
project and administered by a Project Coordinator. The Government has already appointed
the Project Coordinator, the Chief Finance Officer (CFO), and the Accountant. A high-
level consultant, well versed in Bank-financed project management and implementation,
would provide technical support on a semi-continuous basis to the PCU.
18.   Because of the complexity for the MoEFB of the reforms contemplated under the
Project, an Inter-ministerial Reform Implementation Committee (IRIC) would be
created to monitor and control the implementation of the Project, provide technical
leadership and assure overall coordination of the project's diverse components. The
Director of Cabinet of the MoEFB, in his capacity as manager of the project, will chair the
IRIC whose membership will include all the Directors General as well as those Directors
reporting directly to the Director of Cabinet. All decisions concerning the Project, in
particular, the selection of tasks to be carried out under the project, terms of reference for
studies, contract awards and the selection of consultants would have to be approved by the
Chairman of the IRIC on the advice of its members, before requesting IDA's no objection.
19.   On-going evaluation of the project will be carried out by a Project Interagency
Technical Coordination Committee (PITCC) whose members will be drawn from the
Ministry of Economy, Finance and Budget and other Ministries, external bodies and
agencies involved in the implementation of the project. The membership of the PITCC
will also include representatives of the Private Sector and the Civil Society. Members will
elect their chairman. The rationale for such an institutional arrangement is to foster
conditions that will provide for better collaboration among the line ministries and agencies
involved in the project. Non-governmental stakeholders would be represented by an
independent professional in the PCU; he/she would be in charge of organizing consultative
fora among the Government, Civil Society and the Private Sector.
Appendix 6 shows the project's Organizational Chart.
20.   Responsibility for Project implementation would be assigned to the following
ministries and agencies:



6
Component I:   -    Ministry of Hydrocarbons (MoHy)
-    SociSti Nationale des Petroles du Congo (SNPC)
Component II:   -    Ministry of Economy, Finances and Budget (MoEFB)
-    Auditor Geineral Office (Cour des Comptes, CDC)
-    Central Commission for Public Contracts
Component III:  -    Committee of Privatization
-    Centre de Formalites des Entreprises (CFE)
-    Centre National de Gestion (CENAGES)
Component IV:  -    Ministry of Health (MoHe)
-    Programme National de Lutte Contre le Sida (PNLS)
Financial Management, Periodic Reporting and External Audits
21.   Accounting and financial management of the project funds will be the
responsibility of the Finance Section of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The Section
consists presently of a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and an Accountant with adequate
qualifications and experience to undertake their respective tasks. The PCU will monitor the
pace of project implementation and increase the financial staff in accordance with the
workload implied by increases in the volume and complexity of project transactions. The
Finance Section will be responsible f-or the management of the Special Account, ensuring
that project expenditures incurred for the purposes intended under the project, are in
accordance with established procedures, and that adequate supporting documentation is
retained for review or audit by supeivision missions and external auditors. To this end, it
will establish appropriate procedures for the disbursement of funds to the various
implementing agencies, internal control procedures, accounting and periodic reporting of
the use of project funds by such agencies.
22.  IDA's requirement as regards submission of quarterly Financial Management
Reports (FMRs) has been carefully explained to the financial staff and it has been agreed
that the project will commence submitting FMRs beginning with the first full (calendar)
quarter after effectiveness. IDA will provide further guidance to improve and bring these to
a level acceptable to IDA. The CFO has commenced prospecting for appropriate
accounting software capable of maintaining project accounts, as well as generating
financial data and periodic reports required by IDA.
23.   Semi-annual financial statements of the project will be audited by independent
external auditors under terms of reference acceptable to IDA. The Finance Section will
establish the procedures to ensure that project expenditures incurred by implementing
agencies are submitted and consolidated in time for external audits. The audit report will
include a management report and separate opinions on the use of SOEs; Special Account
will be submitted to IDA within six months following the end of each financial year. A
Special Account has been opened at a commercial bank acceptable to IDA.

VI.   MAIN CREDIT CONDITIONS
25.   The credit will be effective after:
(a)  The Borrower has adopted the Project Implementation Manual (PIM) in form
and substance, satisfactory to IDA.
(b)  The Borrower has established a financial management and accounting system
within the PCU for the purposes of the Project, in form and substance,
satisfactory to IDA.
(c)  The Borrower has prepared a Project Procurement Plan (PPP) for the first
year, satisfactory to IDA
VII.  ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS AND COMPLIANCE WITH BANK POLICIES
26.   Environmental Aspects: As the proposed project is essentially an institutional and
technical assistance capacity building operation, no adverse environmental impact
is foreseen. In accordance with the Association's operational directives on
environmental assessments (OD 4.01, Annex E), the proposed project has been
placed in Category C and does not require an environmental assessment.
27.   Compliance with Bank Policies: This project complies with all applicable Bank
policies.
VIII. PROJECT BENEFITS
28.   The project is an integral part of the reform program contemplated under the Bank's
Transitional Support Strategy. The project will help finance the implementation of
structural reforms envisaged under the accompanying Post Conflict Economic
Rehabilitation Credit with financial and technical support going primarily to strategic
agencies and entities in order to ensure economic recovery and rehabilitation as well as the
attainment of long-term development objectives. In this context, the project will:
(i)   Improve the transparency of decision-making in the government and its agencies,
with priority being given to the management of oil resources and to state
budgetary expenditure, public procurement and control processes. It is expected
that new procedures and controls will lead to increased public revenues.
(ii)   Be instrumental in  achieving  greater transparency  of government's
disengagement from the economy, as it will help strengthen the privatization
program, and draft the implementation decrees permitting greater participation
of the private sector in the ownership or management of public utilities.
(iii)  Strengthen partnership and dialogue among government, civil society and
the private sector.

REPUBLIC OF CONGO: Transparency and Governance Capacity Building Project
Appendix 2: Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1: Increasing Transparency and Improving Governance of Oil
Operations (US$1.38 million)
The Sector of Hydrocarbons
The Production-Distribution-Commercialization Line- Congo is sub-Sahara's third
largest oil producer (after Nigeria, Angola, Congo and Gabon), with estimated proven
reserves of 1.5 billion barrels. The country's total production, on the rise since 1980, but
now stationary, was 265,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) in 1999 and 2000 (13 million tons a year
on average). Consumption in 1997 and 1998 of refined petroleum products was about
385,000 tons per year (8,000 bpd). Net oil exports were approximately 12.2 million tons in
1997 (245,000 bpd) and 12.8 million tons in 1998 (257,000 bpd). The Congo's main crude
export markets are the United States and Italy. While most of Congo's crude oil exports are
destined for Western Europe (mainly France) and the United States, Congo is seeking to
increase its sales to Asian countries. Congo exported 53,000 bbl/d of crude to the United
States during the first seven months of 2000, ranking this country as the 7th largest supplier
of imported oil to the United States.
Congo's sole refinery, Congolaise de Raffinage (CORAF) was commissioned in 1974
and began operations two years later in Pointe Noire. The name plate capacity of the refinery
is 21,000 bbl/d. Fighting from 1997 through 1999 severely disrupted the supply of CORAF
fuel to the national market and led to an increase in fuel imports. Critical repairs were made
to the refinery in early 2000, allowing CORAF to fully resume its activities in April 2000 for
the first time in four years. In September 2000, fuel from the refinery was again able to reach
Brazzaville due to the re-opening of the Pointe Noire-Brazzaville rail line. In June 2000, a
South Africa-brokered financial arrangement was announced to pay for the dredging of the
port of Pointe Noire. The port, equipped to a depth of 13 meters to enable large ships to
dock, had cited up to a depth of only 7 meters for many years.
The Republic of Congo contains an estimated 3.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas
reserves. After Nigeria and Cameroon, Congo holds the third largest gas resource base in
Sub-Saharan Africa. Although the majority of Congo's gas reserves are associated with oil
deposits, the country benefits also from non-associated fields. Unfortunately, all the
country's gas output is currently vented or flared for want of appropriate infrastructure. In
1999, the oil sector represented about half of GDP, and revenues from oil accounted for 72%
of fiscal and 92% of export receipts. The sector is expected to continue to be the major
contributor to GPD in the years to come. The many problems affecting the oil sector in
Congo have placed the country at the lowest level of state revenue-generation amongst oil-
productive countries in Sub-Sahara Africa.



20
Sector Organization - The Petroleum Sector in Congo is overseen by the Ministry of
Hydrocarbons (Ministere des Hydrocarbures, MoHy), the National Oil Company (Societe
nationale des Petroles, SNPC), the Refinery Company (Compagnie de Raffinage, CORAF),
the private operators of oil fields, and the companies responsible for oil distribution and the
trading of refined oil products.
In the course of recent years, the sector has gone through progressive but substantial
reforms as the Government wanted to have effective operational and fiscal control over the
sector. The most important transforrnations have been:
i.    Legislative reforms with the adoption of the Hydrocarbon Code in 1994
which substituted for the Mining Code of 1982 which itself had replaced the
Mining Code of 1962. While the new Mining Code of 1982 provided for the
transformation of existing joint venture arrangements (royalties) with foreign
oil exploration companies into production-sharing agreements (PSAs), the
Hydrocarbon Code authorized the use of PSAs with the two most important
petroleum exploration companies in Congo, ELF-Congo and AGIP-Congo.
Under the PSAs, foreign oil companies act as contractors for the national oil
company, SNPC. The PSAs are intended to ensure a constant, minimum flow
of oil revenues to the State, commensurate with similar agreements between
other regional oil ex,porting states and major oil companies. Congo's PSAs
commit foreign partners to carry out exploration and development within a
predetermined time (usually three years for each phase). Contractors finance
all investment costs, and recover their investments when production begins.
Further revisions of ihis code are on-going and aim at a complete legislative
overhaul that should facilitate the country's authorities access to basic
information and the effective implementation of existing fiscal legislation.
ii.   Sector reorganization through the creation in 1974 of Hydro-Congo, that
effectively provided ifor the separation of the regulatory functions of the State
under the aegis of MoHy from petroleum operations under Hydro-Congo
management. Petroleum operations were then privatized. In April 1998, the
Government established a new national petroleum company, the Societe
Nationale des Petroles du Congo (SNPC). SNPC assumed both upstream and
all functions of the former State Company, Hydro-Congo, when exploration
and assets were fonnerly transferred to SNPC in February 2000. Hydro-
Congo's distribution operations were privatized in June 2001 and in August
2000, SNPC assumed ownership of CORAF. At that time, SNPC assumed
responsibility for the commercialization of the country' share of oil
production. This measure was an important break with the past, when all
production and commercialization were in the hands of foreign oil exploration
companies. Three international oil producers/distributors currently ensure the
distribution of gasoline in Congo.
iii.   Signature in June 2001 of an agreement between the Ministry of Economy,
Finances and Budget (MoEFB) - MoHy and SNPC that defines the regulatory
role of the State and of SNPC.



21
Sector Issues - There are three key issues in the oil industry in the Republic of
Congo: the state's share of the country's total petroleum production, one of the lowest in the
world; a large part of future oil production is secured (earmarked) for the payment of specific
foreign debts and specific investments; all oil revenues are not centralized into the
Government Treasury. Thus, despite the already important reforms accomplished, there are
still serious problems relating to full control of the State over this non-renewable natural
resource that represents the most important share of the country's GDP. There is an urgent
need for the State to simplify the complex and intricate legal, technical and financial
relationships the State has maintained with foreign oil producers. More specifically, the
following issues affect sector operations transparency and governance:
i.     Concerns regarding the volume of production:
a.     Lack of transparency in the procurement of works for oil field
development and the awarding of big contracts.
b.     Lack of control over oil production meters in sea-oil rig platforms
c.     Separation of water from oil at the terminal and not at the platforrns.
d.     Losses during transportation of oil are not accounted for.
ii.    Concerns regarding the oil production cost and oil profits:
a.     Linear depreciation of field development costs in 3 to 4 years versus 7
years stipulated in the General Tax Code (depreciation accounts for
about 40% of total production costs).
b.     Premiums being paid to operators at the time of signature of oil
exploration permits.
c.     Costs of goods and services exchanged between operators.
d.     Advances made to SNPC on future oil revenues.
e.     Exchange risk on foreign debts for the State as producers' financial
accounts are held in US$.
f      Weakness of the local financial system  that is not able to handle
financial transactions in the sector.
iii.    Concerns regarding fiscal revenues:
a.     Fiscal privileges, such as unique, ring fenced taxable production for
several rigs as compared to taxation of individual rigs, thus permitting
tax mitigation.
b.     Complex legal agreements and new clauses added to existing ones,
making the whole set of legislation difficult to understand.
iv.    Concerns regarding the capacity of existing operations:
There is a chronic shortage of qualified personnel in the sector in all fields of
expertise: finance, petroleum engineering, foreign languages, etc.



22
The Project - The Project would be instrumental in improving the transparency and
governance of oil operations in the country, thus increasing the level of resource
mobilization by the State. This component would be carried out in two phases, as follows:
First Phase - Consultants/Auditors would be engaged for the following activities:
i.    Financial and operational audit of SNPC (FYI 999-2000) by an independent
auditors.
ii.    Financial audit of AGIP (FY2000), TEP Congo (FY1999-2000) and
NOMECO (FY2000).
iii.   Finalization of the Oil Code and presentation of its implementation decree(s)
to the Government. Finalization of the regulatory framework for the oil
refinery, gasoline transport and distribution.
iv.   Complete operational audit of the SNPC as well as the entire hydrocarbon
sector (MoHy, SNPC, refining, distribution and commercialization), more
particularly:
a.    Field inventory of on-shore and offshore oil production.
b.    Analysis of production costs and profit levels on oil in every single oil
field.
c.    Review of fiscal legislation and fiscal exoneration in the oil sector.
d.    Analysis of crude oil prices.
e.    Review of SNPC's stock holdings in international oil producing
companies.
f.    Review of procurement guidelines for petroleum operations.
g.    Review  of all existing  contractual arrangement and  other
complementary clauses concerning the State's obligations to oil
producers as well as some of financial institutions and contractor
companies.
h.    Study of an oil production model facilitating the determination of oil
revenues under different circumstances of oil production, rig
operations, oil quality, transportation and storage (re: model prepared
by the World ]Bank in 1994).
i.    Assessment cf training needs in the sector and presentation of a
training program that the Association might partly finance.
j.    Assessment of modern equipment needs for the line of production,
cost accounting, oil profits, financial projections, and presentation to
the Association of an investment program, part of which might be
financed under the project.
The first phase is likely to last about 12 months with all tasks completed by
December 31, 2002. Consultants and other related costs for this phase are estimated at
US$700,000. IDA will assume the full financing of this component discounting the facilities
and amenities that local sector institutions might provide.



23
Second Phase - Consultants/Auditors would be engaged to help MoEFB, MoHy and
SNPC implement the recommendations and activities scheduled during Phase one.
Notwithstanding the conclusions of the consultants, Phase 2 would include:
i.   Implementation of the recommendations made by the operational audit of the
hydrocarbon sector (MoHy, SNPC, refining, distribution and commercialization).
ii.   Renegotiations of existing conventions and contracts with a view to
simplifying their execution and facilitating State control.
iii.   Finalization of the Gas Code and implementation decree(s).
iv.   Implementation of the model for oil production and revenue analysis.
v.    Continuation of the training program and purchase of equipment.
The second phase is likely to last about 24 months, with all tasks scheduled for
completion by June 30, 2005. Costs for the second phase have been estimated at
US$680,000, discounting the local facilities the Government would provide to the
consultants. IDA will assume the full financing of this component.
Project Component 2: Increasing Transparency and Improving the Governance of
Non-Oil Operations (US$5.74 millions)
Background - Rehabilitation of the non-oil public sector is a key objective and a
high priority for the Government, given the continuing presence of a number of structural
obstacles that could jeopardize economic recovery over the long term. These include the
severe external and domestic debt problem, issues relating to the reconstruction and
rehabilitation of economic and social infrastructure, the cost of demobilizing and
reintegrating displaced populations and young combatants, and the destruction of
government's information systems and databases. In addition, the state's highly complex
financial operations are managed by staff that is often unprofessional, a situation that
provides fertile ground for the vast system of extortion and State tax evasion. The
government has designated MoEFB to take the lead to address these issues.  The
Government is also aware that transparent procurement rules and a fair judicial system
would definitively enhance good governance.  In Congo they are respectively the
responsibility of the Commission nationale de Centralisation et de Coordination des
marches de V'Etat and of the Cour des Comptes. The second Project component will
support some important reforms and provide technical assistance to these agencies.
Ministry of Economy, Finance and Budget (MoEFB)
MoEFB Organization - MoEFB is a large and powerful ministry; its responsibilities
include the management of both the national accounts and public finances. This is partly the
result of merging the previous two Ministries of Planning and of Finance, which led to the
superposition of offices with similar responsibilities and, in part, the addition of new
structures that could not always be justified in terms of efficient management.



24
The ministry is organized into twelve General Directorates, nine Support Divisions,
one Inspection Directorate and the public financial institutions under the ministry's tutelage,
including banks and insurance companies. The Minister's Cabinet ensures the coordination
of the day-to-day operations of the ministry. Caisse Congolaise d'Amortissement (CCA) is a
public financial institution with civil legal status and financial autonomy. A Management
Board manages it. The chairman is the Minister of Economy, Finance and Budget. CCA's
board includes representatives from the Cour des Comptes, DGT, DGCF, BEAC, and from
MoEFB and personnel of the CCA iitself. CCA is a key player in the management of the
country's external and internal debt.
Resources to address organuizational issues have been lacking. This situation is
compounded by the Governnent freeze of recruitment in the public administration for the
past ten years. In addition, there has been no easy access to any form of training in the
country.
During the internal civil unrest and torment of the past decade, much of the efficient,
pre-conflict administrative tissue disappeared, fiscal management was disrupted, budgetary
procedures were abandoned and budget deficits were financed through the accumulation of
arrears. Because of the country's heavy indebtedness, given the enormous cost of
reconstruction, and despite increasing oil revenues, the State has been left without enough
resources to even pay civil servants on a regular basis. Meanwhile, the authorities gave a
high priority to urgent and pressing economic and financial problems rather than addressing
the future. All attempts to set up any strategic programming in the Ministry were discarded.
Management of the Reforms - The Project would be the vehicle of management
reforms in MoEFB. In order to carry out this responsibility and to ensure a high order of
transparency in decision-making to address the complex list of the reforrns contemplated
under the Project, and as described in Section VI. Project Institutional and Implementation
Arrangements (paragraphe 21), an Inter-ministerial Reform Implementation Committee
(IRIC) would be created to manage t:he whole process.
National Accounts and Statistics - The cessation of any form of information and
statistics gathering during the many years of internal conflict has created a vacuum in terms
of available economic, financial and social information, including poverty data, for the
preparation of national accounts ancd their analysis by decision-makers. The project would
address these issues, as follows:
i.     Modernization of the preparation of national accounts with support from
AFRISTAT.
ii.    Strengthening the coordination between the CNSEE and MoEFB for the
preparation and use of national statistics.
iii.    Creation of a database on economic performance and poverty in the country.



25
Programming and budgeting - There is no multi-year programming system in place
in the MoEFB. On the other hand, there is a large number of Directorships and
Departments involved in the elaboration of statistics, conducting studies and gathering
economic, financial and other accounting information. Without appropriate medium-range
planning process, investment decisions are difficult and priorities are generally ill defined,
particularly in termns of capital expenditures.
The Project would provide assistance to MoEFB for the following activities:
Analysis of existing procedures and number of General Directorates and
Directorates intervening in the programming of public revenues and
expenditures.
ii.   Preparation and implementation of a new  system  of pluri-annual
programming of public investments.
Public Accounting and Budget Implementation Process (chaine des depenses) -
The public accounting and budget implementation processes are at the core of expeditious
and efficient budget execution, budgetary control and the implementation of the investment
program. During the past five years, the authorities have striven to rationalize the
numerous legal texts that frame the management of public finances. The Fundamental Act
of October 24, 1997 abrogates the Constitution of March 15, 1992 and defines the act of
payment. The Organic law (Re'gime financier de l'Etat) was approved by the National
Transition Council in February 2000. It defines the financial framework of the State
(preparation of the Annual Finance Law and Budget execution). The Decree on Public
Accounting (Reglement gineral sur la Comptabilite Publique) was signed in August 2000.
It defines the rules governing the management of budgetary resources. Finally, the
Accounting Instructions underline how the national Chart of Accounts (that follows the
CEMAC Chart of Accounts) should be implemented.
The Inspectorate General of Finance (Inspection Generale des Finances, IGF) is
responsible to verify that all ministries and agencies of government respect public
accounting and financial rules and guidelines. To that end the IGF carries out the internal
audit of public accounts and financial transactions. The role of the IGF to verify that
public funds are managed with probity is particularly important.
Despite these positive developments, many issues still limit the good management
of public finances. The most important is that MoEFB, in its role as Ordonnateur
principal, is the only ministry authorized to approve expenditures. All ministries should
normally have this authority.  This additional control renders the whole budget
implementation process more cumbersome. At the same time, the full implementation of
the public accounting system, as recommended by CEMAC, is not yet complete, and the
number of clearances requested during budget execution (a priori controls) and the
complexity of each transaction have generated important delays in the processing of
expenditures. The large number of advances (comptes provisoires) has also complicated
the control over expenditures. In addition, in the absence of a common system for
classifying accounts for the Budget and the Treasury, the processing of payments has led to



26
a high level of arrears as payments cannot be made, in principle, until the expenditures
have been verified as being part of the budget. Meanwhile, without the closing of annual
accounts for the past seven years, no serious control over investment expenditures has been
realized.
The Project would address these issues as follows:
1.    The Government would:
a. Carry out a study of alternatives to MoEFB's being the single
Ordonnateur Principal, to be completed by 12/31/03.
b. Undertake the closing of final annual accounts for the years 1994-2001.
Start year 2002 on a new budgetary basis.
ii.    MoEFB would:
a. Carry out an analysis of the budget preparation and budget
implementation process (chaine des depenses), with a view to simplifying
it through the reduction of the number of clearances (a priori controls),
the volume of documents required as proof, and the reduction of the
number of advance accounts.  It is expected that Government will
introduce a new system for the classification of accounts and transactions
for the budget andi the treasury that would permit the integration of the
budget implementation process, and the reduction of the number of
advance accounts.
b. Undertake the arnLalysis of payment and collection transactions in the
Treasury with a view to reducing government arrears. Design and set up a
new monitoring system for financial transactions.
c. Study and implement the computerization of the budget implementation
process.
d. Finalize the implementation of public accounting following the chart of
accounts recommended by CEMAC.
e. Prepare the chart of accounts for public enterprises.
f. Undertake the dissemination of accounting publications.
Resource Mobilization - The recurrent difficulties in raising sufficient revenue to pay
back the country's heavy foreign debt and to cover the enormous cost of reconstruction,
despite increasing oil revenues, are also at the top of the Authorities' concerns. Combating
tax fraud and increasing tax revenues is thus a priority, along with economic diversification
to reduce Governments reliance on petroleum revenues. The mobilization of national
savings might be another promising avenue to raise additional resources.
The organs in charge of fiscal and customs matters are the General Directorate of
Taxes (DGI) and the General Directorate of Customs (DGD). In spite of Government recent
efforts to strengthen the DGI and the DGD (e.g., they were reorganized in October 1999),
fiscal revenues are still far below their potential. This situation stems essentially from
difficulties in correctly assessing the tax base of individuals and corporations, weak tax



27
legislation and, more generally, the administrations' lack of capacity (e.g., the rate of
collection of taxes recorded by DGI and sent to TGP for payment is lower than 10%).
There are other more technical issues affecting the fairness of taxation and efficiency
of tax collection. Among them, the large number of tax reductions and exemptions is
certainly the most important. Indeed, tax reductions or exemptions are granted for certain
imports and exports, by the investment code, by hydrocarbons code and by the derogation
plans. Other important problems have been the delays taken by the administration in setting
up a unique Tax Payer Identification Number (TPIN), the implementation of an urban land
register (Cadastre) and an analysis of the informal sector, a growing sector that has thus far
escaped the scrutiny of the administration.
The project would help MoEFB address these issues, more particularly to:
i.    Carry out of an operational audit of DGD.
ii.    Carry out of an operational audit of DGI.
iii.   The studies regarding the establishment of the TPIN have been completed.
The TPIN would be introduced along with the computerization of DGI
activities, which is ongoing.
iv.   Analyze the impact of fiscal reductions and exemptions on the budget of the
State, including existing long-term contracts with petroleum companies
containing fiscal reductions that cannot be revised for long periods. Prepare a
plan to reduce exemptions and reductions.
v.    Based on the modalities of application of the VAT for the hydrocarbon sector
that were signed on October 19, 2000, introduce the VAT in this sector early
in 2002, i.e., through the Finance Law for this year.
vi.   Study of the informal sector in Congo. The 2002 Finance Law will bring new
developments to increase tax collection from the informal sector; in
particular, a simplified tax return declaration will leave the standard global
taxation to small business enterprises.
vii.   Launch studies for the preparation of the urban land Register and the
implementation of the land tax regime.
viii. Organize and build up the capacity of Direction des Correspondants des
dep6ts et Consignations.



28
Central Commission of Public Contracts
Background
According to the present guidelines for public contracts for goods and services
(Decree 82/329 of April 22, 1982), all bidding documents and contract awards are to be
submitted to the Commission Nationale de Centralisation et de Coordination des marches
des contrats de l 'Etat which, in turn, was replaced by the Decree No 2000/34 of March 20,
2000. This decree created a Central Public Contracts Commission. Because of national
unrest during many years these Coinmissions never met. A more flexible ad hoc system was
adopted under which the Direction Centrale des Marches et de Contrats de l 'Etat (DCMCE)
centralizes all bid evaluations and ensures the day-to-day operations of due diligence and
control. The Minister of Economy, Finance and Budget approves contracts of up to
CFA.500 million (US$715,000).  Higher contracts are submitted to the Adviser for
Economic and Financial Affairs in the Cabinet of the President.
Issues
The present guidelines are far from satisfactory and are not in line with the Bank-
IDA Procurement guidelines. Well aware of these problems, a review of existing guidelines
has been carried out by an Inter-ministerial Committee chaired by the MoEFB. New
legislation has been prepared under which the Central Commission for Public Contracts
would be replaced by several comrnissions with authority to act at the national, regional and
local levels. A regulatory Agency would make sure that this framework and the guidelines
are reviewed from time to time to in accordance with local and international trade and
development and requirements.
The Proiect
Under the Project assistance will be given to DCMCE to carry out a thorough review
of existing local procurement guidelines, and of the proposal made recently by the
commission inter-ministerial for the modernization of these guidelines.
Cour des Comptes
Back2round
The Cour des Comptes (CI)C) is the country's supreme independent audit institution
and as such is responsible for the external audit of all bodies closely linked with the state. It
thus oversees all public finances amd accounts, including those of ministries, departments,
public enterprises, financial institutions and the social security system. The CDC should be a
key actor in ensuring a high level of transparency, accountability and good governance of
public assets. The CDC was created in 1992, but never functioned as a result of the long civil
unrest in the country. With the objective of enforcing budgetary discipline in the country,
magistrates of the Cour des Comptes have recently been appointed by Presidential Decree on
May 25 2001. Unfortunately, CDC has not yet started to function as the Government has not



29
find appropriate office space, and has not budgeted the office and data processing equipment
and materials and the support staff needed.
Issues
A review of the CDC's responsibilities has revealed a series of anomalies regarding
its independence, attributions and the dissemination of its reports to the media and the
public. Magistrates are appointed by the President. Also, CDC should normally refer the
Attorney General to the appropriate jurisdiction for serious offences found during the review
of public accounts (particularly in cases of corruption). This does not take place in the
Republic of Congo where the CDC identifies offences and defines the sanctions
independently of the importance of the offence. Strangely enough, the CDC has special
attributions in terms of the award of contracts and is empowered to sanction offences to
administrative morale. It would be useful to assess whether CDC should have any role to
play relating to administrative arbitration and whether it should be involved in any issues
pertaining to moral misbehavior. In addition, its attributions should be larger than they are
now. More particularly, CDC should be entitled to audit all organs of the State, not only state
agencies but also private endeavors involving the State contractually. On the other hand,
CDC has been given authority to audit the accountants in the ministries which authorize
expenditures whereas its role ought to be the audit of state finances. In other words, the
CDC should audit the work of the financial controllers of the MoEFB. The CDC annual
report includes only comments on actions it deems useful, whereas the CDC report should
normally be exhaustive, discussed by the Parliament and published widely so that each
citizen can read it. CDC will not be able to start functioning without appropriate offices and
until all necessary equipment is installed. Since no progress has been made along these lines
so far, there is a present no external audit function in operation in Congo.
The Project
Under the Project, CDC's responsibilities would be reviewed and its capacity would
be strengthened as follows:
i.    A comparative study of the responsibilities and the scope of his jurisdiction
and of its autonomy as compared to similar countries in the world.
ii.    Once CDC is installed in suitable premises, strengthening  it through the
provision of communication and other equipment necessary to carry out its
duties.
iii.   Complementary training of magistrates.



30
Equipment and Training
Issues
There is a chronic shortage of qualified personnel in the MoEFB in all fields of
expertise: macroeconomic, finance, public administration, accounting, engineering and
foreign languages. Likewise, there is an enormous lack of appropriate data-processing and
communications equipment. The Government understands that its reform program will never
be implemented if there is no solution to the chronic shortage of qualified personnel and
equipment in MoEFB.
The Project
Equipment and training for the second component of the Project would be as
follows:
i.    MoEFB, DCMCE and CDC would prepare and present to the Association a
training program for their staff in a several fields including: public finance,
taxation, public accounting, statistics and foreign languages. Study trips in
other African countries might be considered.
ii.   These administrations would also prepare and present to the Association a
list of hardware and software as well as communications and other
equipment necessary to support institutional strengthening. Under this
component, CCA would be entitled to acquire the software necessary to
monitor the country's internal and foreign debt. IGF would also be entitled
to acquire the computers it needs to undertake audits in the field. A library
for the Supreme Court would be part of this component.
iii.   MoEFB  would conduct a feasibility study that would lead to the
establishment of a rnodern system of communications amongst the different
Directorates Generad and Directorates of the MoEFB (Intranet).
iv.   MoEFB would carry out a feasibility study that would lead to the
establishment an Internet connection system for all the MoEFB General
Directorates and Directorates.
Project Component 3: Increasing Transparency and Improving Governance of the
Privatization Process (US$1.59 million)
Disengagement of the State
The disengagement of the State from the productive sectors of the country and the
mobilization of new financial resources through foreign direct investment (FDI) are
amongst the highest Governmental priorities as defined in its program of economic
reforms that was launched in 1999 after the end of the civil war.



31
The rules governing the privatization program are defined in the organic law
No. 21-94 of August 10, 1994, on privatization. An IDA Credit of US$9.0 million was
approved in September 1995 (Credit Number 27750 dated September 5, 1995) to help
finance a Privatization and Capacity Building Project (total cost US$11 million). The
project was to help the Government prepare regulatory frameworks for five public
enterprises in control of petroleum distribution, transportation, telecommunications, power
and water distribution and open these sectors to competition, follow up with the
privatization of these enterprises, liquidate other non-viable enterprises, and support
regulation and competition in the financial sector and reforms in banking institutions. The
Bank project was subsequently canceled in 1999 as a result of civil war. However, as soon
as the hostilities ended the Government restarted its privatization program with the re-
opening of the Comite de Privatization (CP) in charge of the privatization process for
public enterprises, and the transfer of responsibility for processing privatization activities
in the financial sector to the Caisse Congolaise d'Amortissement (CCA) under MoEFB.
The Government program is ambitious but well underway.
The Minister attached to the Presidency and in charge of the President's cabinet
and of State Control chairs the CP. The First Vice-Presidency is entrusted to the Minister
of Economy, Finance and Budget and the Second Vice-Presidency to the Minister of Labor
and Social Security.  CP has a Permanent Secretariat of 13 officers with sector
responsibilities who take care of day-to-day operations. Important decisions are normally
submitted by CP to the Parliament. In the absence of a Parliament, the President takes
decisions.
The Enterprise Reception Center (Centre de Formalitis des Entreprises - CFE) was
created in 1994 to help local private entrepreneurs create new enterprises that would generate
employment for a growing urban population. To that effect, a "One-Stop Investment
Window" (Guichet unique) was set up in Brazzaville in 1995 and another one in Pointe-
Noire the following year. The CFE is an autonomous agency under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises and Handicraft Promotion. The CFE's
responsibilities consist of welcoming new entrepreneurs, providing them all relevant
documentation on the business environment regarding their sectors, facilitating their
inscription in the Tribunal of Commerce and other government agencies, ensuring that all
necessary arrangements with other administrations are completed. CFE also provides for
liaison with the Organization of Business Law in Sub-Saharan Africa. CFE has been very
active in the publication of documentation on investment rules and management and the
conducting of informative seminars. In 2000, the number of registrations for new enterprises
reached 2727, compared with 2181 in 1999 and 1420 in 1988. However, CFE has neither the
capacity nor experience to carry out an important program for the promotion of investment in
the country.
The Centre National de Gestion (CENAGES) was created in the early 1990s to
provide technical assistance to Ministries in matters of management and organization.
CENAGES is an autonomous institution that has recently been granted the status of State-
Revenue Enterprise (Entreprise a caractere industriel et commercial - EPIC). It is well
organized and has a good team of competent experts in all fields of management of private
and public enterprises. CENAGES has been providing its services at low rates relative to



32
those of other consulting firms in the country and has been able to cover its costs essentially
through state budgetary allocations. During the civil war, budgets were reduced and
CENAGES had to reduce its activities. This agency has requested Bank assistance and
financing. Under the ongoing program for the disengagement of the state and the massive
privatization program, there would be no justification to maintain an agency heavily
depending on the State. On the other hand, the relocation of its staff in other public
institutions or private firms might justify Bank support.
Status of the Privatization Program
Financial Sector
Structural adjustment of the financial sector is progressing quite well. Three state
banks have already been restructured with negative assets being transferred to CCA
management. These adjustments are coordinated with the Banking Commission of Central
Africa (COBAC) and receive World Bank support. The current status is as follows:
i.    The Union Congolaise des Banques (UCB) has been privatized. Pending
actions include the legal recording of accounts recording the split of assets
between UCB (private healthy assets), COFIPA (state healthy assets) and
CCA (negative assets). The opening balance sheet for COFIPA is not yet
available.
ii.    BIDC: on October 18, 2001, the Credit Lyonnais (CL) management
Committee approved the takeover of this bank.
iii.   CAIC: Negotiations with the Banques Populaires, a French commercial bank,
are underway.
The structural adjustment of the financial sector is not part of the Project. The World
Bank is directly supporting this process with its own experts and consultants.
PUBLIC ENTERPRISES
Sector Regulation - Sectors that cannot subjected to market rules immediately
should be regulated by the State in order to protect consumers from abuse by firms with
substantial market power, to support investment by protecting investors from arbitrary action
by government, and to promote eccinomic efficiency by fostering technical expertise. These
sectors are generally under the control of utilities and other public enterprises that enjoy
complete a monopoly in their sectors. In the Republic of Congo, the need for sector
regulation applies to water supply, electricity, post and telecommunications and transport
(railways, ports and the use of waterways). CP has proposed the creation of a multi-sector
regulatory agency for all sectors concerned. This would seem to be appropriate in Congo
where the risk of failure of the multi-sector agency should not be too high considering the
relatively small volume of public enterprises to be privatized. One single agency would
provide for the sharing of scarce resources and expertise, would facilitate the transfer of



33
insights and experience among industries, would ease the adoption of a consistent approach
to raise investment, and would reduce the risks of industry or political capture.
Main Issues
i.    The main problem concerning the privatization of public enterprises in the
Republic of Congo is the lack of expertise and of qualified staff in sectoral
regulation and in the supervision and monitoring of the privatization process.
Bad management of a public enterprise being privatized might have important
negative effects during the transition period that immediately preceded
privatization.  During this period, unjustified borrowing or purchase of
equipment can be contracted, assets can be squandered and additional staff
hired.
ii.    According to the Constitution, the President of the Republic appoints EPICs'
general managers. Normally, this is the responsibility of the Board of
Directors of such enterprises.
iii.   Problems regarding the promotion of investments in the country are both
institutional and fiscal in nature:
a.    Institutional, as CFE will have to be re-organized and its operational
capacity built up. CFE activities have been limited to the country, and
no international action has ever been considered. Finally, the lack of
incentives and the shortage of qualified experts have certainly
constrained new and innovative activity by the CFE.
b.    Fiscal in the sense that the main purpose of the constantly growing
number of new enterprises being registered is mainly to benefit from
fiscal exemptions. As no record exists of enterprises being created or
liquidated, many entrepreneurs have found this means to escape the
control of the DGI.
The Project
The project will focus on three main lines of action: the program for the privatization
of public enterprises, the promotion of investment in the country and the establishment of a
partnership among the State, the private sector and civil society.



34
Public Enterprises
Regulatory Framework
i.    Prepare managemeni guidelines for the transition period that precedes the
transfer to new owners or concessionary companies, or the liquidation of a
public enterprise. I'he CP should exercise financial and technical control
over these enterprises during this period (tutellefinanciere et technique).
ii.    Definition of the role., responsibilities and functions of a multi-sectoral
regulatory agency covering all public enterprises.
iii.   Creation of the regulatory agency.
Strengthening the Comite de Privatisation
The following studies would be financed:
* Evaluation of the net assets of the EPICS created in the wake of the
liquidation of ATC.
* Evaluation of the assets of SNDE and SNE.
* Evaluation of the assets of ONPT.
Privatization Process:
i.    ATC: Preparation of a timetable for the whole restructuring process.
ii.    Establish guidelines for the appointment of general managers of newly
created EPICs.
iii.   Organization of a round table in Paris to prepare a work program for the
restructuring of postal services and telecommunications.
Social Window
i.    Seminars to be held on the issues of reinsertion of employees.
ii.    Creation of a Reinsertion Fund.
iii.   Organization of the Fund and appointment of manager.
Training and Equipment
i.    Training seminar on regulatory agencies for staff of all tutelage ministries
managing companies and syndicates.
ii.    Training seminars on the regime of concessions.
iii.   Training of staff in computing activities and computer programming.
iv.   Purchase of computers and communications equipment.



35
Promotion of Private Investment
i.    Analysis of the existing institutional and administrative structure for the
welcoming of private investment in the country (one stop shopping), more
particularly CFE.
ii.    Establish a new structure (or strengthen the existing one) for the promotion of
foreign and local investment in the country in accordance with the terms of
the new Investment Code that will modify the current Code / Loi nO 9-92 of
April 10 1992 modified by law 7-96 of March 6, 1996.
iii.   Computer hardware and software according to needs defined by the analysis .
Assistance from the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) will also be sought.
FIAS helps governments to structure policies, programs and institutions to help them attract
more beneficial foreign investment.
iv.   Study of CENAGES's strengths and weaknesses with a recommendation on
the future status of the company.
Partnership among Government, the Private Sector and Civil Society
The Project would help strengthen the partnership among the Government, civil
society and the private sector. This would be achieved through awareness-raising seminars
and the setup of consultative groups with representatives from all stakeholders: ministries,
NGOs and unions. This component will finance over three years the assignment of an expert
to the Project Coordination Unit. The expert will ensure that this component is implemented
on a timely basis. This will include the preparation and organization of seminars, and
consultative fora, as well as the launching of a study on micro-enterprises, both activities to
be financed under the Project.
Project Component 4: Designing an Action Plan for HIV/AID (US$0.13 million)
The project contemplates financial assistance to the Government for its participation
in the regional HIV/AIDs umbrella program, financed by the Bank. The action plan would
qualify the country for such program.
Project component 5: The Project Coordination Unit (US$1.98 millions)
Project coordination and management is described in Section VI. Project Institutional
and Implementation Arrangements (paragraphs 19 through 23).



36
REPUBLIC OF CONGO: Transparency and Governance Capacity Building Project
Appendix 3: Summary Project Analysis
1. Economic:
This is an institutional capacity building and technical assistance project. It does not
lend itself to detailed cost-benefit analysis and rate of return calculations. Nevertheless, the
project will be instrumental in the generation of new revenues for the State as well as in
improving the collection and efficiency of revenue collection. Thus, the project is expected
to have a high economic rate of return. Moreover, as more state expenditures will be possible
as a direct benefit of the Project, the social impact of the Project is expected to be substantial.
2. Financial
Increasing transparency and improving governance in public sector management is
bound to have an important positive effect on the sources of funds that Government will be
able to mobilize. These objectives will be achieved through more effective control of oil
production, the introduction of modern practices and procedures in the programming and
budgeting process and of controls in the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Budget,
improvements in the efficiency of the collection of income taxes and other taxes and duties,
the progressive disengagement of the State from the economy, and the promotion of foreign
investments in the country. Equity and justice in contractual engagements are to be achieved
through more transparent procurement and judicial procedures.
3. Technical
The recent merger of the foimer Ministries of Planning and Economy, with Finances
and Budget has created some duplication of effort and important delays in decision-making.
Only a few government agencies have access to computers, and the flow of information is
slow and cumbersome. The Project will provide executing agencies with modem
technologies and equipment in the fields of communications, data processing, the intranet
and internet connections. Appropriate training in these areas will also be provided.
4. Institutional
Three decades of centrally planned government, a low rate of participation of the
private sector and civil society in the economy, a lack of training and weak public
institutions have made the public sector in the country both overwhelming and inefficient.
Institutional reforms are currently underway, particularly through the privatization program.
Under the Project, the organization of the MoEFB would be assessed and the flow-of-
information and decision-making processes of the newly created SNPC, the MoEFB, the
Privatization Committee and the One-stop Investment Window for private investments
would be revised and recommendations made and implemented to improve their efficiency.
On the other hand, progress in the updating current staff and the recruitment of new,
qualified staff has been very slow. Thus, the chronic lack of competent staff is probably the



37
most important factor limiting Government's ability successfully to implement its economic
recovery program. Under the project, special emphasis has thus been given to training. In
fact about US$1.7 million has been allocated to train executing agency staff at all levels,
which is about 19% of total project cost. Training would consist of training trainers, sending
top managers to seminars and on study visits abroad, on-the-job training and in-country
training with international experts. In the long run, it would be useful to take into
consideration other incentives that are presently missing (better salaries, work environment,
etc.).
4.1 Executing agencies: and project management:
Detailed information on executing agencies and project management is provided in Section V
on Project Institutional and Implementation Arrangements.
4.2 Procurement Issues:
Detailed information on procurement and disbursement arrangements is given in
Appendix 4.
Institutional capacity in procurement is generally weak throughout the public sector.
The State Contracting Law lacks corresponding regulations, thus promoting conflicting
interpretations. No uniform organizational mechanisms and systems are in place to facilitate
procurement transactions, and there are no standardized or computerized procedures. There
is insufficient training of personnel responsible for carrying out public purchases and
contracting.
4.3 Financial Management Issues:
From the financial management point of view, the main issue is the establishment of
an effective financial management system that is compliant with OP/BP 10.02. The proposed
solution is described in Section VI - Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
(paragraphs 24 through 26). The approach proposed for procurement would be the same. The
mechanisms that have been put in place and which have worked under similar projects
would be used for the present project.



38
5. Social
5.1 Key social issues relevant to the project's objectives and social development outcomes:
The proposed operation does not have a targeted poverty focus, but the strengthening
of the partnership among government, civil society and the private sector would have a
positive, albeit indirect and influential effect on poverty related programs and poverty
reduction. The Project has a special component to enhance a partnership through the setup of
a soft consultative structure that would include NGOs, unions, employer's associations and
representatives from the Ministries and agencies concerned. Consultative fora and seminars
in the capital city and in the interior are scheduled to obtain a consensus on means to
improve the dialogue among decision makers, stakeholders and the beneficiaries of
government programs.
5.2 Participatory Approach: Participation of key stakeholders in the project:
Project beneficiaries are essentially public agencies, all of whom participated actively
in the project design. The elements contained in the TSS have been widely discussed with
stakeholders. In order to further the ongoing, unrestricted political dialogue the Government
is pursuing during the current period. of transition, an informal structure will be created under
the PCU to enhance the participatory approach and coordination among the Government, the
private sector and civil society, as regards implementation of the Project objectives.
5.3 Involvement of consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations in the project:
The project is helping Government disengage from the productive sectors of the
economy, focusing on the privatization program; this will increase the participation of civil
society in public resource mobilization and distribution. A consultative process would be
established at the national level to enhance linkages among the public sector, the private
sector and civil society.

Policy                               Applicability

REPUBLIC OF CONGO: Transparency and Governance Capacity Building Project
Appendix 4: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
GENERAL
1.    A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) for Congo Brazzaville (Congo)
showing that procurement procedures in Congo do not conflict with Bank Guidelines has not
been carried out since 1987. No special exceptions, permits, or licenses need to be specified
in the Credit documents, since Congo's procurement practices allow IDA procedures to take
precedence over any conflicting provisions in local regulations. The Country's Procurement
capacity has been weakened substantially following civil strike in 1997.
1.1.  Substantial capacity rebuilding will be needed to recreate procurement proficiency at
the central and sectoral levels. During the implementation of the Transparency and
Governance Capacity Building Prcject (TGCBP), the capacity of the public procurement
system will be thoroughly assessed and an action plan prepared to develop a training
program and strengthen capacity in order to reduce the procurement risk level for future IDA
financed investments. In 1982, a legal text created a procurement committee (Commission
Nationale des Marches) that was mtodified in 1989 and brought under the responsibility of
the Prime Ministry and Ministry of l,conomy, Finance and Budget (MoEFB).
1.2.  Several members of its staff are reportedly not familiar with Bank guidelines and
procedures on procurement and disbursement. Therefore, it would be necessary for the PCU
staff to receive intensive training in procurement. Although the PCU Coordinator and the
CFO have experience in the execution of IDA financed projects, they have not been exposed
to recent developments in Bank-financed procurement and would not in any event, be able to
handle current, detailed procurement procedures. Therefore, a Procurement Specialist has
just been recruited to assist in the preparation of requests for proposal, evaluation and
contract management. The procurement specialist will be under the supervision of the PCU
Coordinator.
Guidelines
2.    No civil works are scheduled for the project. Goods financed by IDA will be
procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits
(January 1995 revised in January ancl August 1996, September 1997, and January 1999). The
Bank's Standard Bidding Documents, and Standard Evaluation Report will be used for ICB.
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) advertised locally would be carried out in accordance
with Congo's procurement laws and regulations, acceptable to IDA, provided that they assure
economy, efficiency, transparency, and broad consistency with the key objectives of the
Bank Guidelines. Under NCB, the procedures should ensure that: (i) methods used for the
evaluation of bids and the award of contracts are made known to all bidders and not be



41
applied arbitrarily; (ii) any bidder is given adequate response time (four weeks) for
preparation and submission of bids; (iii) bid evaluation and bidder qualification are clearly
specified in bidding documents; (iv) no preference margin is granted to domestic
manufacturers; (v) eligible firms are not precluded from participation; (vi) award will be
made to the lowest evaluated bidder in accordance with pre-determined and transparent
methods; (vii) bid evaluation reports will clearly state the reasons for the rejection of any
non-responsive bid; and (viii) prior to issuing the first call for bids, draft, standard bidding
documents prepared as annexes to the Project Implementation Plan will be submitted to IDA
and found acceptable before credit effectiveness.
3.    Consultant Services Contracts financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for the Selection of Consultants by World Bank borrowers (January
1997 revised in September 1997, and January 1999). The Standard Request for Proposal, as
developed by the Bank, will be used for appointment of consultants. Simplified contracts
will be used for short-term assignments, i.e., those not exceeding six months, carried out by
firms or individual consultants.
4.    Advertising
Given the urgency of the project, a General Procurement Notice (GPN) for the first
year of operations, has been prepared during the appraisal and will be issued in the United
Nations Development Business (UTNDB) web site without the need for hard-copy
publication, as well as in the local newspapers to advertise for any ICB for goods and
major consulting assignments to obtain expressions of interest. The requirement for printed
publication of GPN has been waived by the RPA office. The GPN will also be issued in
the national press for contracts to be let under NCB. The detailed GPN for the subsequent
years will be prepared for the project and published in UNDB. It will be updated annually
for all outstanding procurement. Specific Procurement Notices (SPN) and Expressions of
Interest (EOI) for large contracts for consultants services (above US$200,000 equivalent)
will also be advertised in Development Business, and sufficient time will be allowed for
responses to such specific notices (minimum 30 days) before preparing the short-list.
In order to accelerate project implementation, the Government wishes to proceed
with the initial procurement steps before signing the related Credit Agreement. The
procurement procedures, including advertising, will be done in accordance with the
Guidelines in order for the eventual contracts to be eligible for Bank financing, and the
normal review process by the Bank will be followed in accordance with the Procurement
Guidelines for Goods and Consultants mentioned above.



42
5.    Procurement Implementation Arrangements
The overall responsibility for the implementation of the TGCBP lies with the PCU.
The PCU is responsible for carrying out the procurement for all Project Components. To
ensure proper implementation, the PCU will include a project coordinator, specialists to
coordinate implementation of project components, one procurement officer and one CFO.
The PIM will define and specify the procedures for the internal control of procurement
actions, the technical specifications in each case, as well as reference to model contracts as
per the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents. The proposed project will build on that
strength and on the fact that all the executing agencies of the project and the PCU and the
administrative-financial unit which will be in charge of all procurement matters shall be
famniliar with IDA procedures. With respect to procurement, the PCU will act as a service
provider for all executing agencies; it will receive the terms of reference, short-lists or
specifications for goods or equipnment to be purchased, and will prepare the letters of
invitation and draft contracts and ensure that they are consistent with World Bank
guidelines and approved by the CIER.
6.    Assessment of the Procurement Capacity of the Agency that is to Implement
Procurement
An assessment of the procurement capacity of the PCU to verify whether it will be
able to handle the procurement workload under the project has been done. The process has
also helped to set the parameters for prior review limits and the frequency of procurement
supervision. Given the procurement workload during the first year and over the life of the
project, an action plan has been established during preparation of the project to reinforce
the PCU. This action plan was discussed during the negotiations to correct any
management deficiency  in the implementation  agency's capacity  to  administer
procurement efficiently and transparently. It involves (i) recruitment of a procurement
proficient officer to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in the procurement process; (ii)
procurement workshop training under Bank supervision; (iii) procurement training at the
Regional Procurement Center in Dakar (Senegal); and (iv) on an exceptional circumstances
basis, hiring of short-term consultants.
National bidding procedures for public procurement in Congo have not improved.
A portfolio review including procurement matters of all on-going IDA-financed
investment projects in Congo completed before 1997, has confirmed that procurement
capacity is generally weak in the country; it has led, among other factors, to slowing the
rate of disbursements and, in some cases, to the misuse of funds. However, the above-
mentioned review has not uncovered specific weaknesses, except for the filing system that
has already been addressed under the existing PCU.
The risks identified in the assessment include: lack of a procurement officer clearly
responsible for project procurement; lack of procurement planning and lack of staff with
planning skills; and some external influence on the appointment of individual consultants.
The PCU will take actions to rnitigate these risks, such as: revise PCU staffs
responsibilities and functions; appoint a qualified procurement consultant for an initial



43
period of three months and provide further assistance through short-term visits during
project implementation; and favor the appointment of consulting firms over individual
consultants. In addition, the technical specialists in the PCU must submit a six-month
procurement plan each semester to the PCU' s procurement-proficient staff to facilitate
project implementation. The PIM will include the procedures for the internal control of
procurement actions, the technical specifications in each case, as well as reference to the
model contracts as per the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents.
7.    Procurement Plan
The procurement plan for the first two years was prepared during appraisal and has
been finalized during negotiations. It is based on the initial needs of the project's
components. Costs beyond the Project two first years are only indicative at the time of
project appraisal. A draft procurement plan, developed by the Borrower for project
implementation, provides the basis for the aggregate amounts for procurement. It has been
revised by bank procurement staff during the appraisal missions. This plan will be adjusted
as necessary with the assistance of the procurement consultant to be appointed by the PCU
before credit effectiveness. At the beginning of each calendar year, the Borrower shall
update the Procurement Plan with a detailed procurement schedule for the coming year. The
procurement plan will be part of the Financial Management and Accounting Procedures
sections in the PIM.
8.    Procurement Methods
The methods to be used for procurement are described below, and the estimated
amounts for each method are summarized in Table A. The threshold contract values for the
use of each method are fixed in Table B.
Goods
9.    Goods procured under this project will include computer equipment and software,
electronic information systems, other office equipment and materials, training material and
publications, vehicles and office equipment. This procurement would be preferably carried
out under ICB. Procurement through IAPSO may be used for small items. Other goods
(mainly furniture, office supplies and small equipment) locally available at economical
prices and costing less than US$50,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of
US$0.2 million, will be procured through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) under
procedures acceptable to IDA. Equipment and software for the management of TGCBP,
computer system for contract monitoring, and other goods to cost less than US$50,000 per
contract up to an aggregate amount of US$200,000, will be procured through using shopping
(National/International), by comparing at least three quotations obtained from reliable
suppliers up to an aggregate amount of US$0.1 million. These procedures would be based on
a model request for quotations satisfactory to the Association.



44
Consultants Services and Training
10.   Consulting services financed, by IDA would be for: (i) Consultancies on technical
matters regarding the "Societe Naticonale des Petroles du Congo" (SNPC): review of fiscal
legislation regarding the oil and gas industry, external audit, renegotiation of existing
concession agreements, financial diagnosis and monitoring, preparation of a corporate
training Program; (ii) Training, (iii) Support of project implementation, (iv) Financial
management support and financial audits. Consultants financed by IDA, totaling
US$4,3 million, would be hired in accordance with Guidelines: Selection and Employment
of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997 revised September 1997, January
1999 (Consultant Guidelines). Selection would be based on competition among qualified
short-listed firms through Quality-amd Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) by evaluating the
quality of the proposals before combining quality and cost evaluation by weighting and
adding the quality and cost scores. The PCU would publicize procurement notices widely to
ensure that all interested and able consultant candidates apply. The implementation unit will
maintain and update a list of consultants, based upon agreed criteria, which will be used to
establish short-lists.
11.   Other methods would also apply. For audits and other services of a standard nature,
up to an aggregate amount of US$3,9 million, the Least-Cost Selection (LCS) would be the
most appropriate methods. The firm with the lowest price will be selected provided its
technical proposal received the minimum qualifying mark. Consultants' services for small
and simple services (estimated to cost less than US$50.000 per contract and up to an
aggregate amount of US$ 200.000 would be based upon Consultants Qualifications (CQ)
that take into consideration the consultants' experience and competence relevant to the
assignment. Services for lecturers and small studies estimated to cost less than US$10,000,
up to an aggregate amount of US$100,000 per contract, will be procured under contracts
awarded to individual consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5.1
through 5.3 of the Consultants Guidellines.
Firms
12.   All contracts entered into with any firn must be on the basis of QCBS, LCS except
for small and simple contracts that would be procured using CQ.
Individuals
13.   Specialized advisory services (services for lecturers and small studies) which can be
delivered by individuals, would be selected through a comparison of qualifications arnong
Individual Consultants (IC) expressing an interest in the assignment or approached directly,
and hired in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 5 of the Bank's Guidelines.
14.   Short-Lists of consultants for contracts estimated to cost under US$100,000 may be
comprised entirely of national consultants, if a sufficient number of qualified firms (at least
three) are locally available at competitive costs. This would particularly apply to contracts
for auditing services. However, if foreign firms have expressed an interest in those contracts,
they will not be excluded from consideration.



45
15.   IDA Reviews. Contracts financed by IDA above the threshold value of US$100,000
equivalent for Goods will be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. The review process
would cover about (70%) of the contract amount for Goods, and consultants. See Table B
below. A selective, post-review of contracts awarded below the threshold level will apply to
about one in five contracts, and will be carried out by Bank staff or using audits, (and other
consulting firms), as necessary.
16.   Bank staff will also review the selection process for the hiring of consultants
proposed by the Borrower. Prior IDA review for the selection of consultants will include the
review of budgets, short-lists, selection procedures, requests for proposals, evaluation
reports, contract awards, and negotiated contracts. Prior IDA review will not apply to
contracts for the recruitment of consulting firms and individuals estimated to cost less than
US$100,000 and US$50,000 equivalent, respectively. However, the exception to prior IDA
review will not apply to the Terms of Reference of such contracts, regardless of their value,
for single-source hiring, for assignments of a critical nature as determined by IDA, or for
amendments of contracts raising the contract value above the above-mentioned prior-review
thresholds. For all consultant contracts subject to prior review (estimated above
US$100,000), the opening of the financial envelopes will not take place prior to receiving
the Bank's no-objection to the technical evaluation.
17.   Documents related to procurement below the prior review thresholds will be
maintained by the borrowers for ex-post review by auditors and by IDA supervision
missions.
18.   For training abroad, the program, containing names of candidates, costs estimates,
content of courses, periods of training and selection of training institutions, will be reviewed
annually by IDA.
Frequency of Procurement Supervision
19.   Frequency of procurement supervision missions proposed: One supervision mission
to be carried out by the Association, every three months, will include special procurement
supervision for post-review/audits in addition to the prior review supervision. This proposal
is based on the capacity assessment of the PCU in accordance with the overall risk
assessment. This review should cover a sarnple of not less than 1 in 5 contracts signed.
20.   Modification or waiver of the scope and conditions of contracts. Before agreeing to
any material extension, or any modification or waiver of the conditions of contracts that
would increase the aggregate cost by more than 15% of the original price, the Borrower
should specify the reasons therefore and seek IDA's prior no-objection for the proposed
modification
Status of the Project Implementation Manual (PIM)
21.   As a condition for effectiveness, the PCU will submit to IDA: (i) a PIM with a
specific section on procurement, detailing procedures for planning, calling for bids, selecting



46
contractors, suppliers and consultants, and (ii) a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) and a
Procurement Plan for the first year of operations. Internal organization will be incorporated
to better serve as a practical guide describing procedures agreed within the DCA. It will be
used for: (i) supervision and control, including operational guidelines defining the role of
each executing agency, and reporting requirements and (ii) disbursement procedures. The
PIM will be reviewed and adopted. before credit effectiveness. It will be a condition for
credit effectiveness. The draft PIP developed by the borrower has been discussed during the
appraisal mission.
22.   Before effectiveness, the Government will review and agree with IDA on: (i) the
draft procurement plan for the first year, as prepared during the appraisal mission; (ii) a draft
version of the Request for Proposals:; (iii) standard bidding documents to be used under NCB
procedures for goods; and (d) a training plan for the first phase of the project's life. The
Government will also give assurance that it will (i) use the PIM; (ii) use the Bank's Standard
Bidding Documents for ICB, the Standard Request for Proposals for the selection of
consultants, and the Standard Bid Evaluation Reports; (iii) apply the procurement procedures
and arrangements outlined above; (iv) update the procurement plan on a regular basis during
annual reviews with IDA and other donors, to compare target times and actual completion,
and transmit it to IDA, during impleimentation, with all procurement-related documents; and
(v) carry out, during annual reviews, an assessment of the effectiveness of bidding
procedures and performance, as they relate to the program's procurement experience, and
propose for IDA and donors' consideration any modification to the current procedures to the
extent that they would accelerate procurement, while maintaining compliance with the
Bank's Procurement Guidelines and adequate control over contract awards and payments.
Guidelines and adequate control over contract awards and payments
23.   In addition, the Government hEas given assurances, at negotiations, that it will take the
measures necessary to ensure that procurement phases do not exceed the following target
time periods:
Procurement Phases               Maximum number of Weeks
Preparation of Bidding Documents   4 (6 for large contracts)
Preparation of Bids by Bidders     4 (6-10 for ICB)
Bid Evaluation                     2 (4 for large contracts)
Signature of Contracts             2
Payments                           3
24.   The proposed thresholds for prior review, based on the procurement-capacity-
assessment of the project-implementirLg unit, are summarized in Table B.

Assumptions: 10% of the total amount of the credit is considered unallocated.
The PPF amount is equivalent to US$700,000.
Disbursement Mechanism, Flow of Funds and Risk Management
Proceeds of the credit will be disbursed from the IDA account to a Special Account
(SA) opened at CAIC, a commercial bank, acceptable by IDA. Funds would subsequently
flow from the SA to a Project Account (PA) to facilitate disbursements in local currency at
each level of the project. Only amounts exceeding 25% of the amount advanced to the
special account could be claimed through the direct payment procedure. The PCU would
receive an initial advance to commence operations. The advance would be kept initially to a
limited amount while project activities get underway, but would be increased once full
execution begins and cumulated disbursements reach a predeterrnined threshold. The initial
amount, the disbursement threshold, and the maximum special account amount would be
agreed upon during negotiation. For subsequent disbursements, the PCU would submit
appropriate justification on the use of amounts disbursed earlier (bank reconciliation
statements and other reasonable documentation) to IDA. The SA would be audited annually
by an external auditor acceptable to IDA. When replenishment of the SA is requested, the
PCU should indicate on its reconciliation statement the location and amounts outstanding in
any other project account.
Payments to the Beneficiaries would flow from the project account and would be
made according to predetermined disbursement schedules to be specified in the respective
proposals. Transfer payments would be effected expeditiously when due, and fund



50
management would follow transparent procedures that would be standardized across
Executing Agencies and detailed in the PIM.
The use of Statements of Expenses (SOEs) would be contingent upon a satisfactory
assessment of the PCU's financial management capacity, including the maintenance of
proper accounts, the preparation of project progress reports, the ability to process and
maintain SOE documentation, and satisfactory annual auditing arrangements. Provided these
conditions are met, SOEs would be used for all expenses. Furthermore, all expenses related
to contracts below prior-review thresholds would be claimed on the basis of SOEs, and the
supporting documentation underlying all SOEs would be made available for review by Bank
supervision missions at any time. Supporting documentation would be retained by the PCU.
The primary responsibility for maintaining the records rests on the CFO. The satisfactory
assessment of the financial managemnent system would be one condition of effectiveness.
Use of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs)
Basic Principles
2.1   The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the PCU team would be entrusted with the
Program's overall financial management and reporting and would serve as the principal
contact for Bank disbursement purposes. Each Executing Agency would be in charge of
reporting with respect to its own activities, and would be required to provide copies of its
reports to the Head of the PCU. Payments to the Beneficiaries would flow from the PA and
would be made according to predetermined disbursement schedules to be specified in the
respective proposals. Transfer payments would be effected expeditiously when due, and fund
management would follow transparent procedures that would be standardized across
Executing Agencies and detailed in the implementation manual.
Use of Statements of Expenses (SOEs)
2.2   The use of SOEs would be contingent upon a satisfactory assessment of the PCU's
financial management capacity, including the maintenance of proper accounts, the
preparation of project progress reports, the ability to process and maintain SOE
documentation, and satisfactory annual auditing arrangements. Provided these conditions are
met, SOEs would be used for all expenses. Furthermore, all expenses related to contracts
below prior-review thresholds would be claimed on the basis of SOEs and the supporting
documentation underlying all SOEs would be made available for review by Bank
supervision missions at any time. Supporting documentation would be retained by the PCU.
The primary responsibility for mainltaining the records rests with the CFO. The satisfactory
assessment of the financial managemrent system would be one condition of effectiveness.



51
Special Account
2.3   The Government has opened a SA in the name of the PCU at CAIC, a commercial
bank, to which project funds will be deposited. The objective of the special account is that
most, if not all credit funds be disbursed through this procedure, with the PCU relying as
little as possible on direct payments from IDA in Washington. Only amounts exceeding 25%
of the amount advanced to the special account could be claimed through the direct payment
procedure. The PCU would receive an initial advance to commence operations. The advance
would be kept initially to a limited amount while project activities get underway, but would
be increased once full execution begins and cumulated disbursements reach a predetermined
threshold. The initial amount, the disbursement threshold, and the maximum special account
amount was agreed during negotiation. For subsequent disbursements, the PCU would
submit appropriate justification on the use of amounts disbursed earlier (bank reconciliation
statements and other reasonable documentation) to IDA. The Special Account would be
audited annually by an external auditor acceptable to IDA. At the time when replenishment
of the SA is requested, the PCU will indicate on its reconciliation statement the location and
amounts outstanding in any other project accounts.
Project Account
To facilitate disbursements at each level of the project, the government has opened a
PA at CAIC that would receive funds in local currency. PA is funded by the Special Account
and will be managed according to the procedures specified in the PIM and in accordance
with respective annual work programs and budgets. The consolidation of expenses will be
effected by the PCU.

REPUBLIQUE DU CONGO
Projet de Renforcement des Capacites de Transparence et de Gouvernance
Appendice 5: Lettre de Politique de Developpement du Gouvernement de la
Republiqule du Congo pour 2001/2002
Au cours des annees recentes, la scene politique et sociale a ete marquee par des
conflits armes successifs qui ont occasionne de fortes pertes en vies humaines, pousse plus
d'un tiers de la population congolaise a deserter leur residence habituelle, ebranle 1'
infrastructure de base et detruit la plupart des moyens de production. Pour faire face a ces
problemes, le Gouvemement de la Republique du Congo a lance un programme de
redressement economique avec le soutien financier de la communaute financiere
internationale, et en particulier 1' Association pour le Developpement International (IDA)
qui a recemment approuve un Credit de Redressement Economique Post-Conflit de 37.8
millions de dollars americains. Le Gouvernement est engage a introduire des reformes
recommandees dans cette operation. Plus precisement, le Projet propose de Renforcement
des Capacites de Transparence et de Gouvernance va pourvoir a I' assistance technique et
de gestion n6cessaire requise pour rnettre en oeuvre ces reformes. Cette lettre de politique
de developpement donne une image generale de la maniere dont le Gouvemement entend
utiliser les ressources de ce nouveau credit IDA.
Contexte politique et economique
Quand la guerre civile eclata en juin 1997, P' economie congolaise avait deja e
affaiblie par des annees de gestion economique mediocre et de gouvernance precaire et par
un conflit anterieur en 1993-94. I)urant ces dissensions intemes, les depenses etaient
reorientees pour faire face aux besoins de securite et a la demande urgente d' assistance
alimentaire pour les personnes affect&es par le conflit. En 1' absence de financement
domestique et externe adequat, le dLeficit budgetaire etait finance principalement par une
accumulation d'arrieres, qui entramna a la fois une deterioration de la balance des paiements
et un epuisement des reserves en devises du pays. En consequence, les arrieres de la dette
exterieure a fin 1999 s ' accrfurent a un montant representant 94 pour cent du PIB. Le PIB
non p6trolier accusa un d6clin de 19 pour cent sur la periode 1997 -98 et les prix a la
consommation fluctuerent considerablement a cause du fait que les marches etaient
inadequatement approvisionnes et I' infrastructure des transports et communications avait
ete endommagee.
Le Forum National pour 1 'Unite, la Reconciliation et la Reconstruction Nationale,
tenu en janvier 1998, a convenu d'un retour a la vie democratique, et, a cette fin, a
proclame une p&iode de transition flexible de trois ans. Un Conseil National de Transition,
avec 75 membres, a ete mis sur piedL par le Forum et il joue le r6le d'un organe legislatif.
Une commission constitutionnelle etait cr66e pour r6diger la nouvelle Constitution qui sera
adoptee en janvier 2002.



53
Les accords de cessez-le-feu signes le 16 novembre et le 20 decembre 1999
poserent les bases pour un retour A la paix. Apres de si nombreux episodes penibles et
regrettables, le Congo retrouve A nouveau la voie de la paix et de la reconciliation
consolidees par I' organisation harmonieuse du Dialogue National tenu du 17 mars au 14
avril 2001. Cette rencontre permit A pres de 1.500 delegues venus de tous les horizons
politiques et milieux sociaux de s'exprimer, d'echanger les points de vues et d'aboutir a un
consensus sur les problemes essentiels sous-jacents A un d6veloppement calme et paisible
de la nation. Un referendum pour la nouvelle Constitution aura lieu en janvier 2002, et les
elections generales suivront immediatement conformement aux reglements en vigueur.
Le Gouvernement espere qu'une amelioration dans la situation politique et
securitaire du pays va conduire au redressement economique en general et particulierement
dans les secteurs de l'agriculture, de la sylviculture, du commerce, des transports et des
travaux publics. Le Gouvernement est aussi engage A restaurer les services, plus
particulierement dans les domaines de la sante, des soins de sante de base, de l'education,
de l'assainissement et de la justice. II est prevu que l'investissement public et prive va
s'accroitre en reponse aux reformes structurelles, A l'amelioration du climat d' affaires, a 1'
accroissement des activites et efforts visant A promouvoir la bonne gouvernance et la
transparence dans la gestion des affaires publiques. En depit de la possibilite d'un
ajustement continu A la fin du programme et le re-echelonnement probable avec les
creanciers du Club de Paris sous les termes de Naples, de grandes insuffisances financieres
vont continuer durant toute la periode de 2002-05, demontrant ainsi le besoin d'une
assistance continue.
A la faveur du retour effectif de la paix, le Gouvemement a mis en oeuvre un
Programme Interimaire Post-Conflit (PIPC) pour la periode 2000-02, qui etait adopte par le
Conseil National de Transition. Les principaux objectifs de ce programme sont: (a) la
reconstitution et le renforcement des capacites institutionnelles et administratives, en
posant la fondation pour une bonne gouvernance et 1' application des regles de
transparence; et (b) 1' amelioration du cadre macro-economique et du climat social pour
stimuler la capacite d' offre de l'economie et promouvoir la croissance economique. Pour
atteindre ces objectifs, le Gouvernement congolais s'est engage A poursuivre une politique
de developpement soutenue par le Credit IDA de Redressement Economique Post-Conflit.
Par ailleurs, le Gouvemement est preoccupe par la reconstitution et la
modernisation de l'administration publique. Pour cela il entend se concentrer sur la gestion
des finances publiques, la gestion de l'economie, la planification strategique et la gestion
horizontale et verticale de toutes les ressources. Le Projet de Renforcement des Capacites
de Transparence et de Gouvemance se propose de renforcer la capacite de gestion des
structures administratives de l'Etat responsables du cadre macro-economique au Congo.
Le Projet de Gouvernance de Renforcement des Capacites de Transparence et de
Gouvernance
Le Projet comprend trois composantes strategiques: le secteur des hydrocarbures,
l'administration publique et le desengagement de l'Etat de lHeconomie, il s'y ajoute un plan



54
d'action pour le VIH/SIDA. Chacune des trois composantes principales est developp6e ci-
dessous avec une attention particulierement donnee aux engagements de l'Etat.
Transparence et gouvernance dans le secteur petrolier
La production du petrole a ete et restera pendant longtemps un facteur clef dans
l1'conomie nationale et une force agissante pour le developpement economique et social.
Cependant, l'Etat ne tirera pas entierement profit de ses ressources petrolieres tant que
certaines questions importantes ne seront pas reglees. Le Gouvemement reconnait que
deux problemes clef affectent le developpement du secteur: la part de l'Etat dans la
production petroliere totale du pays est l'une des plus faibles au monde; et, le fait qu'une
grande partie de la production de p6trole future est engagee au paiement de la dette
exterieure. Ainsi, des reformes importantes devraient etre entreprises pour permettre a
l'Etat d'exercer un meilleur controle de ses ressources naturelles non-renouvelables qui
representent plus de deux tiers du produit interieur brut du pays.
La transformation du secteur a ete longue et douloureuse; cependant les
changements prennent dejA forme. Des reformes legislatives reglementant le secteur, avec
l'adoption du Code d'Hydrocarbures en 1994, ont clarifie la separation des fonctions
r6gulatrices de l'Etat sous l'egide du Ministere d'Hydrocarbures (MoHy) d'operations de
p6trole sous la Societe Nationale des Peitroles du Congo (SNPC). La SNPC est une
entreprise nationale autonome. Elle a ete creee en 1998 pour reprendre toutes les activites
d'exploration et de production du secteur jadis devolues a Hydrocongo. Le desengagement
de l'Etat se poursuit activement avec la privatisation recente de toutes les operations de
distribution et un peu plus tard de toutes les activites connexes.
Malgre ces progres, il subsiste de nombreuses preoccupations quant au volume de
production (par exemple, le manque de controle de compteurs de production du petrole sur
les plates-formes en mer), a la determination du cofit de production du petrole, et du profit
petrolier (par exemple, l'utilisation de taux d'amortissement lineaire plus court applique
aux depenses de developpement), aux nombreux privileges fiscaux prevalant dans le
secteur du p6trole, A la complexit6 des accords legaux et de nouvelles clauses
supplementaires ajoutees A celles existantes rendant ainsi la legislation entiere difficile A
comprendre, et, finalement, au manque chronique de personnel qualifie.
Le Projet vise a servir d'appui pour le d6veloppement et la mise en oeuvre des
mesures sous le nouveau cadre legal et l'introduction de nouvelles refonmes dans le secteur
petrolier. Un programme d'action en deux etapes a et convenu entre le Gouvemement et
I'Association. La premiere phase couvre toutes les mesures A mettre en oeuvre A court
terme conform6ment a l'esprit de la convention recemment signee entre le MoEFB, le
MoHy et la SNPC qui determine le role et la responsabilite de chaque partie. Ces mesures
comprennent:
* L' audit financier de la SNPC et le lancement de I' audit financier des trois
principales societes de production de petrole.



55
* L'achevement du Code Huiles et textes d'application des conventions et contrats de
partage de production du petrole, la finalisation de la reglementation concemant la
redistribution, le raffinage et le transport.
*  L' audit operationnel complet du secteur des hydrocarbures.
*  La conception d'un modele d'operations de production du p6trole et de calcul des
revenus dans chacune des zones de production.
*  L ' evaluation et le financement de la formation du personnel, du traitement de
donnees et des equipements de telecommunication.
Pendant la deuxieme phase les actions recommandees pendant la premiere periode
seront mises en oeuvre, a savoir:
*  Recommandations faites par l'audit op6rationnel du secteur des hydrocarbures

Transparence et gouvernance dans le secteur public non-petrolier
La rehabilitation du secteur public non-petrolier est un objectif clef et une priorite
de gestion pour le Gouvernement, etant donne la presence d'un certain nombre d'obstacles
structurels qui pourraient mettre en danger le redressement economique a long terme.
Ceux- ci comprennent le probleme grave de la dette exterieure et interieure, des questions
touchant a la reconstruction et a la rehabilitation de l'infrastructure economique et sociale,
le cofit de demobilisation et de reinsertion des populations deplacees et de jeunes
combattants, et la destruction du systeme d'information et des bases de donnees. De plus,
les operations financieres hautement complexes de l'Etat sont gerees par un personnel qui
est souvent non professionnel, une situation qui fournit un terrain fertile a un systeme
enorme d'extorsion et de fraude. Le Gouvemement a designe le MoEFB pour prendre
l'initiative d'aborder ces questions. Des regles transparentes de passation des marches et un
cadre juridique adequat vont aussi ameliorer d'une fa,on significative la bonne
gouvemance. Au Congo, il y a respectivement la responsabilite de la Commission
Nationale de Centralisation et de Coordination des Marches de l'Etat et de la Cour des
Comptes. Ensemble avec le MoEFB, ces agences vont beneficier de la deuxieme
composante de Projet.
Ministere de 1 'Economie, des Finances et du Budget (MoEFB)
Le MoEFB est un ministere important ayant la responsabilite de gestion tant des
comptes nationaux que des finances publiques. Sa lourde structure, est en partie le resultat
de la fusion des deux Ministeres precedents (Plan et Economie, Finances et Budget) qui a



56
conduit A la superposition des services avec des responsabilites semblables. Les ressources
pour aborder les questions organisatjlonnelles ont aussi fait defaut.
A cause de la complexite des reformes envisagees sous le Projet, le Gouvernement
a consenti a creer un Comite d'Exicution de la Reforme (CER) au sein du MoEFB pour
assurer la mise en oeuvre et le suivi du Projet. Le Directeur de Cabinet presidera le CER
qui sera compose de tous les Directeurs generaux et des Directeurs rattaches. Toutes les
decisions concemant le Projet, particulierement toutes les decisions relatives au choix des
taches A effectuer sous le projet, aux octrois de contrats et au choix de consultants, devront
recevoir l'approbation du CER.
Une des premieres priorites du Ministere sera la constitution d'une base statistique
necessaire pour ameliorer la gestion 6conomique. En effet, l'interruption de toute forme
d'information et de collecte statistiques pendant les nombreuses annees de conflit interne a
cree un vide en termes d'information economique, financiere et sociale disponible, y
compris le niveau de pauvrete, pouI la preparation des comptes nationaux et leur analyse
par des decideurs. Pour corriger cette situation, le Gouvemement sollicite l'appui de I'IDA
pour moderniser ses comptes nationaux selon la norme SCN93 et ERETES, aussi bien que
pour creer une base de donnees sur la performance economique et le niveau de pauvrete
dans le pays. En meme temps, les autorites ont l'intention de renforcer la coordination a I'
interieur du ministere pour la preparation et l'utilisation des statistiques nationales.
Un autre probleme est la faiblesse au sein du MoEFB du systeme de programmation
pluriannuelle qui permettrait d'elaborer une politique coherente d'investissements publics. Les
autorites ont conclu qu'une analyse des procedures existantes et du nombre de Directions
Generales et des Directions intervenant dans la programmation des revenus et depenses publics
devrait etre entreprise avec l'appui de l'Association pour etablir aussitot que possible un
systeme de programmation au sein d'un processus decisionnel clairement defini.
Le MoEFB est aussi conscient que de nombreux facteurs negatifs affectent encore
la bonne gestion des finances publiques. Les efforts vigoureux que le Gouvemement a
deployes ces dernieres annees powr rationaliser tous les textes legaux qui encadrent la
gestion des finances publiques sont loin d'etre suffisants. Ces efforts doivent se poursuivre
tant avec la mise en oeuvre de la comptabilite publique conformement au plan comptable
recommand6 par la CEMAC qu'avec la preparation d'un plan comptable pour les
entreprises publiques.
En meme temps, la simplification du processus d'execution du budget (Chaine des
depenses) devrait etre lanc6e avec la reduction des autorisations, le volume des documents
justificatifs et le nombre des comptes d'avance, aussi bien que l'introduction d'une
nomenclature unique des comptes du Budget et du Tresor qui permettrait la pleine
integration du processus. La conception et la mise sur pied d'un nouveau systeme de
contr6le des transactions financieres au Tresor faciliteraient alors la reduction d'arri&res
aussi bien que la cloture des comptes annuels finaux pour les annees 1994-2001 et le debut
de l'annee 2002 sur une nouvelle base budgetaire. L'informatisation du processus



57
d'execution budgetaire devrait etre etudiee et introduite au moment ou les comptes et le
processus budgetaire sont en train d' etre mis en place.
Les difficultes recurrentes dans la mobilisation des ressources suffisantes pour
rembourser la lourde dette exterieure du pays et pour couvrir les besoins de reconstruction,
malgre l'augmentation des revenus petroliers, font partie des preoccupations des autorites.
Combattre la fraude fiscale et augmenter les revenus fiscaux constituent alors une priorite
pour ameliorer la part des recettes hors petrole dans le PIB. Malgre les efforts recemment
faits par le Gouvernement pour renforcer les administrations des douanes et des imp6ts,
(par exemple, elles etaient reorganis6es en octobre 1999), les revenus fiscaux restent en
deca de leur potentiel. Cette situation resulte de la difficulte d'evaluer correctement la base
fiscale des individus et des societes, de la faiblesse de la legislation fiscale et, plus
generalement, de I' insuffisance des capacites des administrations.
Le Gouvemement a decide de faire un diagnostic general (I'audit operationnel) de
ces deux Directions Generales en vue d'augmenter leur efficacite et leur capacite de
produire davantage de revenus pour l'Etat. En meme temps, des actions immediates seront
entreprises, y compris l'analyse de l'impact des reductions et exemptions fiscales sur le
budget de l'Etat, et la preparation d'un plan pour corriger cette situation, la mise en oeuvre
d'un Num&ro d'Identification du Contribuable (TPIN/NIC) qui a e  jusqu'ici limite aux
plus grandes entreprises, le lancement d'etudes pour la preparation du bureau du cadastre
urbain, et la mise en oeuvre du regime d'imp6t foncier et une etude du secteur informel au
Congo.
Les autorites sont aussi preparees a appliquer la Taxe sur la Valeur Ajoutee ( TV
A) sur toutes les entreprises et autres activites pour augmenter les revenus. A cette fin, le
ddcret de son application au secteur des hydrocarbures a et6 signe le 19 octobre 2001 avec
effet retroactif des janvier 2001. Les autorites ont aussi reconnu que la TVA ne devrait pas
etre utilisee comme une mesure de protection, mais, en meme temps, ne devrait pas mettre
les entreprises locales dans une position moins competitive par rapport aux societes
6trang&res intdressees a etre en concurrence pour les contrats locaux de biens et services.
Le Gouvernement entend faire appel a I' epargne nationale pour mobiliser des
ressources complementaires. Dans cet esprit, le Tresor a recemment cree une Direction
speciale appelee la Direction des Correspondants des Depots et des Consignations. En
consequence, le Gouvemement sollicite l'appui de l'IDA pour la mise en place et le
fonctionnement de cette Direction.
Le Gouvernement est bien conscient que la bonne gestion des finances publiques
requiert l'application de directives justes et equitables de passation des marches des biens
et services publics aussi bien que l'installation d'un systeme judiciaire capable d'assurer la
transparence, la responsabilite et la bonne gouvernance des ressources publiques. Pour
atteindre ces objectifs, le Gouvernement a initi6 une revue des directives existantes de
passation des marches par un Comite Interministeriel prdside par le MoEFB, etant donne
que les directives pr6sentes sont loin de repondre aux exigences modernes d'affaires et de
commerce international et ne sont pas conformes aux directives de la Banque-IDA. Une



58
nouvelle legislation a et preparee sous laquelle la Commission Centrale de Contrats
Publics serait remplacee par plusieurs commissions ayant F'autorite d'agir aux niveaux
national, regional et local. Une Agence reglementaire s'assurerait que cette structure et ses
directives soient passees en revue de temps en temps pour les mettre au niveau des
standards intemationaux. L'aide d.e l'IDA est demandee pour effectuer un examen
minutieux de cette proposition.
La Cour des Comptes (CDC) est l'institution independante supreme d'audit du pays.
Elle etait creee en 1992 pour surveiller tous les comptes et finances publics, y compris les
entreprises publiques, les institutions financieres et le systeme de securite sociale.
Malheureusement, la CDC n'a jamais fonctionne suite a la longue agitation civile dans le
pays. Avec l'objectif de faire appliquer la discipline budgetaire, les magistrats de la Cour
ont recemment et nommes. Cependant, un examen de ses responsabilites a revele une
serie d'anomalies quant a l'independance de ses magistrats, les attributions de la Cour et le
manque d'information au public sur ses decisions et jugements. Les Autorites ont donc
decide de conduire une etude comparative des responsabilites et la portee de la juridiction
de la Cour et de son autonomie en comparaison a d'autres pays semblables dans le monde.
Une fois que la Cour est installee, le renforcement de son organisation dans la
communication et d'autres equipements necessaires pour mener a bien ses obligations peut
commencer.
Le Gouvernement comprend que son programme de reforme ne sera jamais mis en
oeuvre si aucun remede n'est apporte au manque chronique de personnel qualifie dans tous
les domaines d'expertise au MoEFB. De meme, le besoin d'equipements modemes de
traitement de donnees et de telecommunication est enorme. Le MoEFB et les autres
agences impliquees dans le Projet ont convenu de preparer et soumettre a l'IDA un
programme de formation de leur personnel sur un large eventail de domaines, comme les
finances publiques, la taxation, la comptabilite publique, les statistiques et les langues
etrangeres. Ces administrations prepareraient aussi et presenteraient a l'Association une
liste de materiel et de logiciel aussi bien que d'equipements de communications et autres
necessaires pour la realisation des objectifs de renforcement institutionnel indiques dans le
Projet.
Transparence et gouvernance dans, le processus de privatisation
Le desengagement de l'Etat cles secteurs productifs dans le pays et la mobilisation
de nouvelles ressources financieres A travers l'investissement etranger direct sont parmi les
plus hautes priorites du Gouvernement. Les regles r6gissant le programme de privatisation
ont e definies dans la loi organique No.21-94 du 10 aoilt 1994 sur la privatisation. Ce
programme a ete arrete pendant la gaerre civile. A la fin de la guerre, le Gouvernement a
repris le programme avec la reinstallation du Comite de Privatisation (CP) responsable du
processus de privatisation pour les entreprises publiques non financieres. En revanche, le
traitement du secteur financier (Banques et Assurances) a et confie au MoEFB.
L'ajustement structurel du secteur financier progresse d'une maniere satisfaisante.
Trois banques d 'Etat ont deja ete restructurees avec leurs actifs negatifs transferes a la



59
gestion de la Caisse Congolaise d'Amortissement. La liste des entreprises publiques A
privatiser a et  publiee et les entreprises ont e   classees en deux groupes appeles
<<p6rim&tres)>. Le premier perimetre inclut les cinq plus grandes entreprises publiques du
pays. Le deuxieme perimetre couvre le secteur de l'agro-industrie, les societes de service,
le secteur de sylviculture, le secteur des transports et de transit, et le tourisme (h6tels). Un
volet social est inclus dans la loi de privatisation. Les realisations principales jusqu'a
present dans le secteur du petrole incluent le transfert des activites d'exploration et de
production d'Hydro-Congo a la SNPC, et la privatisation en cours de la distribution du
petrole, des avoirs de GPL et de la Congolaise de Raffinage.
Dans les autres secteurs, le processus est en cours pour la signature d'accords
concessionnaires dans les secteurs de l'alimentation en eau et en electricite pour lesquels
plusieurs societes internationales ont exprimE deja leur interet. De plus, le Code d'Eau et le
Code d'Electricite ont ete transmis au Conseil National de Transition pour approbation, et
les structures reglementaires pour ces deux secteurs sont en voie d'achevement. Dans le
secteur des transports, 1'ATC a ete scindee en trois entreprises publiques. Aussi 17 soci6tes
ont-elles exprime leur interet de soumissionner pour un contrat de mise en concession du
CFCO; et les termes de reference pour la restructuration des transports par voies
navigables (VNPTF) ont dte prepares. Dans les Services Postaux et de
Tlelcommunications, le Ministere des Postes et Telecommunications a publie en decembre
2000 une Lettre de Politique Sectorielle sous-jacente a l'accord de Gouvemement pour la
dissolution de l'ONPT, la dissolution de la Caisse Nationale d'Epargne et la creation des
Services Postaux et de Caisse d'Epargne du Congo (SOPECO).
Quant au deuxieme perimetre, sept societes publiques sont en voie de privatisation
ou sont en cours de liquidation dans le secteur d'agro-industrie; deux societes de service
sont en cours d'evaluation par des consultants internationaux; dix entreprises de
sylviculture sont en train d'etre 6valuees A des fins de liquidation; trois societ6s dans le
secteur des transports et transit sont en voie de privatisation et six h6tels ont ete evalues
par des cabinets de conseil intemationaux A des fins de privatisation.
Les principaux problemes poses par le programme de privatisation des entreprises
publiques demeurent le manque d'expertise et de personnel qualifie dans la reglementation
des secteurs et dans la surveillance et le controle du processus de privatisation. Autant que
la promotion d'investissements dans le pays est concernee, les problemes sont d'une nature
a la fois institutionnelle et fiscale. Pour renforcer I ensemble du processus et la capacite de
privatisation, le Gouvernement est d6cide A mettre en oeuvre une serie de mesures, et plus
particulierement:
* Definir le r6le, les responsabilites et les fonctions d'une agence de reglementation
multi-sectorielle couvrant toutes les entreprises nationales que le Gouvemement va
creer pour contr6ler son programme de privatisation
* Preparer des directives de gestion pour la periode de transition qui precede le
transfert A de nouveaux proprietaires ou des concessionnaires ou la liquidation
d'une entreprise publique.



60
*  Organiser des seminaires de formation au sujet des agences de regulation et du
regime des concessions, pour le personnel de tous les ministeres, des entreprises
publiques et des syndicats.
*  Organiser un programme de formation pour le personnel du Comite de Privatisation
et d'autres agences, dans les operations informatiques et de programmation.
* Preparer un calendrier sur tout le processus de restructuration du secteur des
transports et organiser une table ronde pour faciliter la preparation d'un programme
de travail pour la restructuration des services postaux et de telecommunications.
* Chercher l'aide du Service Consultatifdes Investissements Etrangers (FIAS) pour la
definition des politiques, programmes et institutions qui peuvent attirer beaucoup
plus d'investissements etrangers avantageux.
* Etablir une nouvelle structure ( ou renforcer celle existante) pour la promotion
d'investissements etrangers et locaux dans le pays en concordance avec les termes
de la nouvelle charte nationale des investissements qui attend son adoption par le
Gouvernement.
* Conduire une revue des forces et des faiblesses du Centre National de Gestion
(CENAGES) et faire des recommandations sur le statut futur de ce centre et de son
personnel.
* Preparer une liste d'equipements de traitement de donnees et de telecommunications
necessaires pour mener a bien le programme de privatisation.
Partenariat entre le Gouvernement, le Secteur Prive et la Societe Civile
Le Gouvemement s ' engage a accroitre son partenariat avec la societe civile et le
secteur prive. A cette fin, le Gouvermement soutiendra fortement la tenue de seminaires
d'information et l'installation de groupes consultatifs avec des representants de toutes les
parties interessees: ministeres, organisations non gouvernementales et syndicats de
travailleurs.

REPUBLIC OF CONGO: Transparency and Governance Capacity Building Project
Appendix 5A: Letter of Development Policy
From the Government of the Republic of the Congo for 2001-2002
In recent years, the social and political scene has been marked by successive armed
conflicts which have resulted in heavy losses of human life, caused over one third of the
Congolese population to flee their usual place of residence, undermined basic infrastructure
and destroyed much of the means of production. To address these issues, the Government of
the Republic of Congo has launched an economic rehabilitation program with the financial
support of the international financial community, in particular the International Development
Association (IDA) that recently has approved a Post Conflict Economic Rehabilitation
Credit of USD37.8 million. The Government is committed to introduce the reforms
recommended in this operation. More precisely, the proposed Transparency and Governance
Capacity Building Project will provide the technical and management assistance necessary to
implement these reforms. This letter of Development Policy provides a general picture of
how the Government intends to use the proceeds of this new IDA credit.
Political and Economic Context
When civil war broke out in mid-1997, the Congolese economy had already been
weakened by years of mediocre economic management and poor governance and by an
earlier conflict in 1993-94. During the internal strife, expenditure was redirected to meet
security needs and the urgent demand for food aid for persons affected by the conflict. In the
absence of adequate domestic and external financing, the budget deficit was financed mainly
by the accumulation of arrears, which resulted in a deterioration in the balance of payments
and exhaustion of the country's foreign currency reserves. As a consequence, external debt
arrears increased, amounting to 94 percent of GDP by the end of 1999. Non-oil GDP
declined by 19 percent over the period 1997-98 and consumer prices fluctuated considerably
because markets were inadequately supplied and transport and communications
infrastructure had been damaged.
The National Forum for Unity, Reconciliation and National Reconstruction, meeting
in January 1998, had decreed a return to democratic life and, for that purpose, proclaimed a
flexible three-year transition period. A National Transition Council, with 75 members, was
established by the Forum and acts as the legislature. A constitutional commission was set up
to draft the new Constitution. At the conclusion of the all-inclusive National Dialogue, a
preliminary draft of the Constitution was adopted by all Congolese men and women at home
and abroad.
The agreements on a cease-fire in the Republic of the Congo signed on November 16
and December 20, 1999 laid the foundations for a return to peace. After so many painful and
regrettable episodes, the Congo is back on the road to peace - a peace consolidated by the
smooth organization of an all-inclusive national dialogue from March 17 to April 14, 2001.
These meetings enabled almost 1,500 delegates from all backgrounds and shades of opinion
to talk, exchange views and achieve consensus on the essential issues underlying a calm and
peaceful course for the nation. A referendum for a new Constitution is to take place in early



62
2002 and general elections for the Presidency and Parliament will follow immediately in
accordance with existing regulations.
The Government expects that improvement in the country's political and security
situation will lead to economic recovery in general and particularly in the sectors of
agriculture, forestry, trade, transport and public works. As far as the social sectors are
concerned, the Government is committed to restoring services, particularly in the areas of
health, primary health care, education, environmental sanitation, the judiciary and highway
maintenance. Public and private investment is expected to rise in response to structural
reforms, improvement in the business climate, increased activity and efforts to promote good
governance and transparency in the management of public affairs. Despite the possibility of
a continuous adjustment after the end of the program and a probable rescheduling with Paris
Club creditors under Naples terms, large financial shortfalls will continue throughout the
period 2002-05, demonstrating the need for continuing aid.
In the wake of these positive developments, the Government had already drawn up an
Interim Post-Conflict Program (PIiPC) for the period 2000-02, which was adopted by the
National Transition Council. The main goals of this program are: (a) reconstitution and
strengthening of institutional and administrative capacities, by laying the foundations for
good governance and the application of rules of transparency; and (b) improvement of the
macroeconomic framework and of the social climate to stimulate the economy's supply
capacity and promote economic growth. In order to reach these objectives, the Congolese
Government is committed to the pursuit of a development policy backed by a Post-Conflict
Economic Rehabilitation IDA Credit (Post-Conflict ERC).
With a view to restoring a modernized public administration, the Government has set
itself to concentrate on managemernt of public finances, direction of the economy, strategic
planning and horizontal and vertical management of all resources. The Governance and
Transparency Capacity Building Project will strengthen the management capacity of the
State's administrative structures responsible for the macroeconomic framework in the
Congo.
The Governance and Transparency Capacity Building Project
The Project includes three strategic components, the hydrocarbon sector, public
administration and the disengagement of the State from the economy; a small fourth
component will prepare an action plan for the HIV/AIDS program. Each of the three main
components is discussed below with particularly attention given to the State's commitments.
Transparency and Governance in the Oil Sector
Oil production has been and will remain for a long time a key factor in the national
economy and a driving force for economic and social development. Yet, the full potential of
the petroleum sector, more particularly the generation of additional revenues for the State,
will not materialize until important issues are addressed. The Government recognizes that
two key problems affect sector development: the State's share of the country's total petroleum
production, one of the lowest in the world; and, the fact that a large part of future oil production is



63
secured (earmarked) for the payment of foreign debt. Thus, important reforms should be
undertaken to put the State in full control of this non-renewable natural resources that represent the
most important share of the country GDP.
The transformation of the sector has been long and painful, yet changes are already taking
shape. Legislative reforms regulating the sector, with the adoption of the Hydrocarbon Code in
1994, have clarified the separation of the State regulatory functions under the aegis of the Ministry
of Hydrocarbons (MoHy) from petroleum operations under the Societe Nationale des Petroles du
Congo (SNPC). SNPC is an autonomous public enterprise. It was created in 1998 to take over all
sector exploration and production activities. State disengagement is being pursued actively with the
recent or ongoing privatization of all distribution operations and of the refinery company CORAF.
Despite this good progress, there are still serious concerns regarding the volume of
production (e.g., lack of control of oil production meters in deep-sea oil-rig platforms), the
determination of oil production cost and oil profit levels (e.g., the shorter linear depreciation rate
used to depreciate field development costs), the many fiscal privileges prevailing in the petroleum
sector, the complexity of the legal agreements and the many new clauses added to existing ones
making the body of legislation hard to understand, and, finally, the chronic shortage of qualified
personnel.
The Project is to serve as the focal point of support for the development and
implementation of measures under the new legal framework and the introduction of new reforms in
the oil sector. A two-stage program of action has been agreed upon with the Association. The first
phase covers all measures to be implemented over the short term in keeping with the spirit of
recently signed agreements between the MoEFB, the MoHy and SNPC that stipulate the role and
responsibility of each ministry and agency. It will include:
*  A financial audit of SNPC and of the three major oil production companies.
* Finalization of the oil code and the issuance and implementation of all regulatory
texts relating to refining and transport
*  A complete operational audit of the hydrocarbon sector.
* The design of an operations model of oil production and revenue generation.
*  An assessment and financing of staff taining, and data-processing and
telecommunications equipment.
During the second phase, the actions recommended during the first period would be
implemented, that is:
*  Recommendations made by the operational audit of the hydrocarbon sector
(MoHy, SNPC, refining, distribution and commercialization).
*  Renegotiation of existing conventions and contracts with a view to simplify their
execution and facilitate State control.
*  Financial and operational audit of SNPC for FY 2002
*  Finalization of the Gas Code and implementation decree(s).
*  Implementation of the model for oil production and revenue analysis.
*  Continuation of the training program and purchase of equipment.

Transparency and Governance in the Non-Oil Public Sector
Rehabilitation of the non-oil public sector is a key objective and management priority
for the Government, given the continuing presence of a number of structural obstacles that
could jeopardize economic recovery over the long term. These include the severe external
and domestic debt problem, issues relating to the reconstruction and rehabilitation of
economic and social infrastructure, the cost of demobilizing and reintegrating displaced
populations and young combatants, and the destruction of the information system and
databases. In addition, the state's highly complex financial operations are managed by staff
that is often unprofessional, a situation that provides fertile ground for the vast system of
extortion and State tax evasion. The government has designated MoEFB to take the lead to
address these issues. Transparent procurement rules and a fair judicial system would also
definitively enhance good governance. In Congo they are respectively the responsibility of
the Commission nationale de Centralisation et de Coordination des marches de l 'Etat and of
the Cour des Comptes. Together with MoEFB, these agencies would benefit from the second
Project component.
Ministry of Economy, Finance and Budget (MoEFB)
MoEFB is not only a powerful but also a large ministry, for its responsibilities
include the management of both national accounts and public finances. It has a heavy
structure, partly as the result of merging the previous two Ministries of Planning and of
Finance which led to the superposition of offices with similar responsibilities, and partly
because new, unnecessary structures have been added. Resources to address organizational
issues have also been lacking.
Because of the complexity of the reforms contemplated under the Project, the
Government has agreed to create an Inter-ministerial Reform Implementation Committee
(IRIC) within MoEFB to follow ul) on the good and timely implementation of the Project.
The Director of Cabinet would chair the IRIC, which would be composed of all the Directors
General and the Directors reporting directly to the Director of Cabinet. All decisions
concerning the Project, in particular, all decisions regarding the selection of tasks to be
carried out under the project, contract awards and the selection of consultants will have to
receive RIC approval.
One of the first priorities M oEFB would like to address is to further the statistical
base needed to enhance economic management. Indeed, the interruption of any form of
information and statistics gathering during the many years of internal conflict has created a
vacuum in terms of available economic, financial and social information, including the
poverty level, for the preparation of national accounts and their analysis by decision-makers.
To correct this situation, the Government is seeking the help of IDA to modernize its
national accounts according to SCN93 standard and ERETES, as well as to create a database
on economic performance and the poverty level in the country. At the same time, the
authorities intend to strengthen the coordination between the CNSEE and MoEFB for the
preparation and use of national statistics.



65
Another issue is the lack of any multi-year programming system in MoEFB that
would enable it to prepare a coherent public investment program with defined priorities.
This, despite the large number of Directorships and Departments intervening in the
elaboration of statistics, the conduct of studies and the gathering of economic, financial and
other accounting information. The authorities have concluded that an analysis of existing
procedures and of the number of General Directorates and Directorates intervening in the
programming of public revenues and expenditures should be undertaken with the
Association's support in order to establish as soon as possible a programming system within
a clearly defined decision-making process.
MoEFB is also aware of the many deficiencies affecting the good management of
public finances. The strenuous efforts the Government has made during the recent past to
rationalize all the legal texts that frame the management of public finances are far from
sufficient. Fundamental changes should follow with both the full implementation of public
accounting in accordance with the chart of accounts recommended by CEMAC and the
preparation of a chart of accounts for public enterprises. At the same time, the simplification
of the budget implementation process (Chaine des depenses) should be launched with the
reduction of clearances, the volume of documents required as proof and the'number of
advance accounts, as well as the introduction of a unique nomenclature of accounts for the
budget and the Treasury that would permit the full integration of the process. The design
and set up of a new monitoring system of financial transactions in the Treasury would then
facilitate the reduction of arrears as well as the closing of final annual accounts for the years
1994-2001 and to start year 2002 on a new budgetary basis. Computerization of the budget
implementation process should be studied and introduced while the accounts and the budget
process are set up.
The recurrent difficulties in raising sufficient revenue to pay back the country's
heavy foreign debt and to cover the enormous cost of reconstruction, despite increasing oil
revenues, are also at the top of the Authorities' concerns. Combating tax fraud and
increasing tax revenues then becomes a priority to diversify the economy from petroleum
revenues. The General Directorate of Taxes (DGI) and the General Directorate of Customs
(GDD) are the two administrations within the MoEFB in charge of fiscal and customs
matters, respectively. In spite of efforts recently made by the Government to strengthen
these two administrations (e.g., they were reorganized in October 1999), fiscal revenues are
still far below their high potential. This situation stems from the difficulty to correctly assess
the tax base of individual and corporations, from weak tax legislation and, more generally,
from the administrations' lack of capacity. The Government has decided to carry out of a
general diagnostic (operational audit) of these two general Directorates with a view to
enhance their efficiency and ability to generate more revenues for the State. At the same
time, immediate actions will be undertaken, including an impact analysis of fiscal reductions
and exemptions on the budget of the State, and the preparation of a plan to correct this
situation, the implementation of the unique Tax Payer Identifying Number (TPIN) that, so
far, has been limited to the largest enterprises, the launching of studies for the preparation of
the urban land Register and the implementation of the land tax regime, and a study of the
informnal sector in Congo.

The authorities are also prepared to apply the Value Added Tax (VAT) to all
enterprises and businesses to increase the revenues it generates. To that end, the modalities
of its application to the hydrocarbon sector have been signed on October 19, 2000 and the
tax will be introduced in this sector next year, i.e., through the finance law for this year. The
authorities have also agreed that the VAT should not be used as a protection measure but, at
the same time, should not put local e nterprises in a less competitive position vis-a-vis foreign
companies interested in competing for local contracts of goods and services.
Calling on national savings might be another promising avenue to mobilize
additional resources. It is with this objective in mind that the Treasury in the Republic of
Congo has recently established a special Directorship called Direction des Correspondants
des De'p6ts et Consignations. Considering the lack of expertise in this area in the country,
the authorities have called for the project to help establish this new Directorship.
The Government is well aware that good management of public finances calls for fair
and equitable procurement guidelines for public goods and services as well as the setup of a
judicial system that can ensure transparency, accountability and good governance of public
assets. To reach these objectives, the Government has commissioned a review of existing
procurement guidelines by an Inter-ministerial Committee chaired by MoEFB, as - the
existing ones are far from responding to modem  international trade and commercial
requirements and are not in line with the Bank-IDA guidelines. New legislation has been
prepared under which the present Central Commission for Public Contracts would be
replaced by several commissions with the authority to act at the national, regional and local
levels. A regulatory Agency would make sure that this framework and guidelines are
reviewed from time to time to upgracde them to international standards. Assistance from IDA
is being requested to carry out a thorough review of this proposal.
The Cour des Comptes (CDC) is the country's supreme independent audit institution.
It was created in 1992 to oversee all public finances and accounts, including public
enterprises, financial institutions and the social security system. Unfortunately, CDC never
functioned as a result of the long period of civil unrest in the country. With the objective of
enforcing budgetary discipline, magistrates of the Court have recently been appointed.
However, a review of its responsibi]ities has revealed a series of anomalies regarding the
independence of its magistrates, the attributions of the Court and the fact that information is
not provided to the public about its decisions and judgments. The Authorities have therefore
decided to conduct a comparative study of the responsibilities and the scope of the Court's
jurisdiction and of its autonomy as compared to similar countries in the world. Once the
Court is installed, strengthening its organization and the provision of communication and
other equipment necessary to carry out its obligations can start.
The Government understands that its reform program will never be implemented if
no remedy is brought to the chronic shortage of qualified personnel in MoEFB in all fields of
expertise.  Likewise, the needs for modern data processing and telecommunications
equipment are enormous. MOEFB and the other agencies involved in the Project have
agreed to prepare for submission to IDA a training program for their staff in a large range of
fields, such as, public finance, taxation, public accounting, statistics and foreign languages.
These administrations would also prepare and present to the Association a list of hardware

and software as well as communications and other equipment necessary to achieve the
institutional strengthening objectives contemplated in the Project.
Transparency and Governance in the Privatization Process
The disengagement of the State from the productive sectors in the country and the
mobilization of new financial resources through foreign direct investment are amongst the
highest Governmental priorities. The rules governing the privatization program were
defined in the organic law No. 21-94 of August 10, 1994 on privatization. This program
was stopped during the civil war.  However, as soon as the hostilities ended the
Government restarted the program with the re-assigning of the Comiti de Privatisation to
be charge of the privatization process for public enterprises, and the transfer of
responsibility for processing privatization activities in the financial sector to the Caisse
Congolaise d'Amortissement. The Government program is large but well underway as
discussed below.
Structural adjustment of the financial sector is progressing satisfactorily. Three
state banks have already been restructured with negative assets being transferred to CCA
management. The list of public enterprises to be privatized has been published and the
enterprises have been classified into two groups within agreed parameters. The first group
includes the five largest public utilities in the country. The second covers the agro-
industry sector, service companies, the forestry sector, the transit transport sector and
tourism (hotels). A social window is included in the privatization law. Main achievements
to date in the petroleum sector include the transfer of exploration and production activities
of Hydro-Congo to SNPC, and the ongoing privatization of petroleum distribution, GPL
assets and Congolaise de raffinage.
In the utility sectors, good progress is being made with respect to obtaining
signatures for concessionary agreements in the water supply and electricity sectors for
which several international companies have expressed already their interest. In addition,
the Water Code and the Electricity Code have been transmitted to the National Council of
Transition for approval, and the regulatory frameworks for these two sectors are being
finalized. In the transport sector, the ATC has been split into three revenue-earning public
enterprises, 14 companies have expressed their interest to bid for the management contract
for CFCO and the terms of reference for the restructuring of waterways transport have
been prepared. In the Postal Services & Telecommunications, the Ministry of Postal
Services and Telecommunications published a Letter of Sector Policy in December 2000
setting out the government's agreement on the dissolution of ONPT, the dissolution of the
National Savings Bank and the creation of the Postal Services and Savings Bank of Congo
(SOPECO).
Regarding the second group, seven public companies are being privatized or going
into liquidation in the agro-industry sector, two service companies are being assessed by
intemational consultants, ten forestry enterprises are being evaluated for liquidation, three
companies in the transport and transit sector are being privatized and six hotels have been
evaluated for privatization by international consulting firms.

The main problems concerning the privatization program of public enterprises in the
Republic of Congo are the lack of expertise and of qualified staff in sector regulation and in
the supervision and monitoring of the privatization process. As far as the promotion of
investments in the country is concerned, problems are of both an institutional and fiscal
nature. In order to strengthen the whole privatization process and capacity, the Government
is determined to undertake a series oi measures, and more particularly to:
*  Define the role, responsibilities and functions of a multi-sector regulatory
agency covering all public enterprises that the Government will create to
monitor its privatization program
*  Prepare management guidelines for the transition period that precedes the
transfer to new owners or concessionaires or the liquidation of a public
enterprise.
*  Organize training seminars on regulatory agencies and the regime of
concessions for staff of all ministries, public enterprises and syndicates.
*  Organize a training program for CP and other agencies' staff in computing
activities and programming.
*  Prepare a timetable on the whole restructuring process of the transport sector
and organize a round lable to facilitate the preparation of a work program for
the restructuring of postal services and telecommunications.
*  Seek assistance from the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) for the
definition of policies, programs and institutions that may attract more
beneficial foreign investment. Establish a new structure (or strengthen the
existing one) for the promotion of foreign and local investments in the
country following the terms of the new national investment charter that is
awaiting adoption by the Government.
*  Conduct a review of the Centre National de Gestion (CENAGES)'s strengths
and weaknesses and recommend on future status of company and of its staff.
*  Prepare a list of data processing and telecommunications equipment
necessary to carry out ihe privatization program.
Partnership among Government, the Private Sector and Civil Society
The Government is committed to enhance the partnership among the Government,
civil society and private sector. To this end, the Government will strongly support the
holding of awareness seminars and the setup of consultative fora and groups with
representatives from all stakeholders: ministries, NGOs and unions.
