                         Implementation Status Overview
                         During 2010, the Project has continued to support the Government in the implementation of key reforms, which are Governance, PFM and Procurement reforms.
                         Significant progress has continued to be made on the implementation of the 3 key activities as noted during the February mission. Those activities are Fiber optic, Fichier unique and
                         Schema Directeur. The Project is doing its best to complete all activities before June 30, 2011, the Project closing date. However, there is a high risk that the implementation of the
                         Fichier Unique will not be completed on time, due to financial situation of Pi-Services which is in charge of the implementation of this activity. The February mission has
                         recommended a closer monitoring of the implementation of the Fichier unique in order to be sure that this activity will be completed before the Project closing date. The Government
                         counterpart was released in accordance to the Financial Agreement.
                         In term of operational effectiveness, the February mission concluded that the overall performance of the Project remains satisfactory, even the implementation of the FM action plan
                         established in January 2010 needs to be completed.
                         Progress has been made on the preparation work of the Governance Repeater Project. During the February mission, the Government agreed that the Repeater Project supports the
                         PFM, Public administration and Procurement reforms.
                         The Team received clearance, after the PCN review meeting. to move forward on the preparation of the Repeater Project.
