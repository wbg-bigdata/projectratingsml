MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A NONFORMAL EDUCATION PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for SDR 7.1 million, the
equivalent of US$10.5 million, on standard IDA ter ms, with a maturity of 40 years, .o help finance
a project for Nonformal Education. This will be a parallel financed project with the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) as lead agency. The total project cost is US$51.0 million equivalent of
which the ADB will provide financing US$26.7 million equivalent, the Swiss Development
Corporation (SDC) will contribute US$3.8 million equivalent and Government will provide US$10.0
million equivalent.
2.         Country/Sector Background. Bangladesh has a population of about 12( million that is
expected to double by the year 2030. Per capita income remains low at US$224, an,1 an estimated
half of the population live in absolute poverty. A key factor contributing to the poverty is the large
illiterate population, especially women, which is posing a serious constraint on Government efforts
to curb the population growth rate and increase labor productivity. Adult illiteracy is 78% for
females and 56% for males. While illiteracy is a problem for all age groups, it is particularly
serious for adolescents and young adults. The total number of illiterates is estimatec to be around
40 million and the number of illiterates in the 15 to 24 years age group is about 10 million. Low
literacy results from a combination of inadequate access to education in the past and continuing low
primary school completion rates.
3.         The Primary and Mass Education Division (PMED), with the Prime Minister as
Minister-in-Charge, has a strong commitment to implementing the compulsory primary education
(CPE) act of 1990 and achieving national Education for All (EFA) goals. Within PMED, the formal
primary education system is administered by the Directorate of Primary Education and a variety of
nonformal education programs are administered by the Directorate of Nonformal Eduication (DNFE).
For the past five years, the Government of Bangladesh has placed high priority on expanding access
to primary schooling and has achieved remarkable results. By 1994, gross primary enrollments
reached over 100% with near gender parity. However, less than half of those who enroll in primary
school complete the five-year cycle and of those who have completed primary schooling less than
half achieve sustainable literacy levels. IDA and the multi-donor community are currently
discussing program support for Government's plans to improve primary school quality to retain
children in school and to raise their learning levels.
4.         Government recognizes the limitations of the formal school system to address the
magnitude of illiteracy and in 1991, set ambitious targets to increase the literacy rate from 33% to
62% by the year 2000 through a massive national nonformal literacy program. This would mean
covering an estimated 40 million illiterates in the ten-year period, but while political commitment to
these targets remains high, these targets are unrealistic within existing institutional capacities. The
project would assist Government to develop capacity for large-scale literacy programs, for without
specific actions to provide increased opportunities for basic education the numbers ( f illiterates will
remain high and a large cohort of illiterate adolescents and young adults will continuie to enter the



-2 -
labor force. Targeting young adults in the 15 to 24 years age group through programs of basic
literacy, numeracy and life skills would achieve substantial pay-off in terms of mncreased economic
productivity, better health and schooling for families, and lower fertility.
5.         Currently literacy and nonformal education programs cover about one million learners
from all age groups and, of these programs, 75% are delivered by Non-Government Organizations
(NGOs). The EFA campaign adopted by Government has been strongly supported by NGOs to
whom nonformal education is an important component of poverty reduction programs. There are
186 NGOs having at least two years' experience of literacy programs and a further 140 NGOs
which have conducted some literacy programs previously. At their best, NGO programs have had
direct relevance to the needs and aspirations of the learners, demonstrated by classes with high
attendance and low-drop out rates. Because of their reputation for effectiveness and innovation,
NGOs have received increasing levels of grant funding from donors. However, most donors
currently supporting nonformal education are active in programs for out-of-school children in the 8-
14 years age group. Only UNDP, NORAD and SIDA are supporting programs for the 15-24 years
age group and their financing will end by June 1996.
6.         Proiect Obiectives. The longer-term objective is to help Govemrment establish a
nonformal education (NFE) system that is capable of delivering effective large scale literacy
programs at affordable costs. The immediate objective is to: (a) expand and improve NFE programs
to reach an estimated 2.5 million learners in the targeted group, 15 to 24 years, of whom 1.3 million
are expected to be females; and (b) strengthen institutional capacity to deliver programs through
NGOs and the district administrations. Programs would complement Government's efforts to
expand and improve primary schooling, emphasize learning for young women and actively involve
NGOs in the program development and delivery process.
7.         Proiect Description. The Project will expand and deliver effective "second chance"
basic education programs specifically focused on adolescents and young adults in the 15-24 age
group. It will establish a stronger policy framework to encourage identification and evaluation of
options for literacy delivery within the financial and administrative capabilities of Bangladesh, and
gradually pave the way for further program expansion. The project will expand the institutional
capacity of NGOs in management and delivery of literacy programs and also strengthen DNFE's
capacity to manage and coordinate such programs (particularly in planning, implementation,
monitoring and evaluation). The project will continue to develop and test different models to
deliver nonformal education programs to the 15-24 years age group.
8.         The five-year Project has the following two major components: expansion and
improvement of nonformal education (60% of total project costs); and institutional development
(13% of total project costs). The balance of project cost covers equipment, facilities and
contingencies.
(a)   To support expansion and improvement of the nonformal educaticn program the Project
will finance:
(i) delivery of NFE programs of one-year duration for young adults (15-24 years),
through qualified NGOs and local organizations, at an average cost of US$12 per
learner;



-3 -
(ii) program quality improvement through student testing, evaluation and revision of
existing training programs; curriculum development that would take advantage of
experience with pilot programs and operations in Bangladesh and elsewhere in
South Asia; training of instructors, supervisors, administrators and teachers for
DNFE and NGO programs in effective methodology and delivery techniques;
development, production and supply of educational and post-literacy materials;
(iii) implementation of alternative NFE models and social mobilization activities; and
monitoring and evaluation mechanisms that identify cost-effective models of
program delivery;
(b)  To strengthen institutional capacity for nonformal education the Project will support:
(i) establishing a National Council for Primary and Mass Education which will act
as a senior level policy, planning, and coordinating authority for primary
education and nonformal education;
(ii) institutionalizing the former Integrated Nonformal Education Program as a
Directorate of NFE within the Primary and Mass Education Division to provide
the institutional base for program planning and monitoring, technical, financial
and administrative support services for NFE;
(iii) training and capacity building of the DNFE to design, manage, monitor and
evaluate program expansion and to support quality instruction through local
training, local and external fellowships and regional study tours; and training for
selected NGOs in management, budgetary and monitoring skills.
9.         Proiect Cost and Financing Plan. The total Project cost is US$51 million equivalent,
including taxes, duties and contingencies, of which an estimated US$4.2 million, or 8%, is the
foreign exchange cost. The IDA Credit would be US$10.5 million of which US$7.2 million is for
program delivery; US$0.5 million for pilot programs; US$0.8 million for service vehicles and US$2
million for contingencies. ADB would provide US$26.7 million, Swiss Development Cooperation
(SDC) would provide US$3.8 million and Government would provide US$10 million. Details of
project costs and the financing plan are set out in Schedule A; amounts and methods of
procurement, allocation and disbursement in Schedule B; a timetable of key project processing
events in Schedule C; and status of Bank Group operations in Bangladesh in Schedule D.
10.       In line with IDA's country assistance strategy of selectivity and cost savings this
Project will be cofmanced with ADB as the lead agency. The Project was appraised jointly with
ADB and IDA participated in technical discussions of the ADB negotiations. The ADB Board of
Directors approved the Loan on September 29, 1995. By agreement of both IDA and ADB, ADB's
document "Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed
Loan to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the Nonformal Education Project" is distributed
separately as IDA's Staff Appraisal Report.

11.        Procurement. The Project Implementation Management Unit will be responsible for
procurement and disbursements under the guidance of the DNFE's Director General. For
procurement, approval of contracts and certification of payments will be made by the DNFE.
Copies of all contracts and supporting documents will be subsequently forwarded to IDA for the
record, and where necessary for prior approval. Vehicles to be financed from the Credit will be
procured following International Competitive Bidding Procedures in accordance with IDA
Guidelines. Vehicles that may be required on an urgent basis and estimated to cost the equivalent
of US$50,000 or less per contract and US$200,000 or less in the aggregate, may be procured under
contracts awarded on the basis of international shopping procedures in accordance with IDA
Guidelines. Procurement of services of NGOs for program delivery will follow procedures
acceptable to IDA (see Annex I, paragraph 2). Details of management of NGO services contracted
under the Project together with criteria and procedures for selection are described in Annexes I and
II. Contracts for vehicles estimated to cost US$50,000 or more, and all other contracts each costing
the equivalent of US$120,000 or more will be fully documented and subject to prior review by IDA.
12.        Disbursement. Disbursements from the IDA Credit will be made against vehicles (at
100% of foreign expenditure, 100% of local expenditures ex-factory cost, and 90% of local
expenditure for items procured locally), delivery of NFE courses conducted by NGOs, and pilot
programs for delivery of alternative models of NFE (including Total Literacy Movement).
Approximately one third of contracts awarded annually under the project to NGOs for NFE program
delivery will be disbursed from the IDA Credit and approximately two thirds of contracts awarded
to NGOs will be financed by ADB. IDA and ADB would finance NGOs in different districts. The
identification of districts for separate IDA and ADB financing would be agreed with DNFE at the
time of the review of annual operational plans. Disbursements below US$50,000 for vehicles and
below US$120,000 for other contracts will be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures to be
kept available at DNFE, Dhaka for examination by IDA. To facilitate timely project
implementation, the government will establish, maintain and operate, under terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA, a Special Account with an authorized allocation of US$700,000. IDA would
make an initial deposit into this Special Account an amount equivalent to about US$300,000 for
utilization in the early stages of the Project. The Special Account will be replenished as and when
necessary up to the limit of the authorized allocation. The Special Account may be used only
against project expenditures which are eligible for IDA financing and withdrawal applications will
be supported by appropriate documentation.
13.        Accounts and Audit. DNFE will maintain project records and accounts in accordance
with sound accounting practices which are subject to satisfactory control and verification. The
DNFE will appoint a Finance Director with qualifications and experience acceptable to IDA and will
ensure that adequate accounting and financial reporting systems are in place prior to the start of
project implementation. Financial and management reports, agreed upon in form, content and
frequency, will be made available to IDA during the Project's implementation period. The DNFE
will (i) maintain separate accounts for the Project; (ii) ensure project accounts are audited annually
in accordance with International Standards of Auditing by independent auditors acceptable to IDA;
and (iii) submit to IDA, within nine months after the close of each fiscal year. a certified copy of
the Project's audited financial statements along with the opinion and report of the independent
auditor.

14.        Project Implementation. The Executing Agency will be the DNFE which will have
overall responsibility for planning, organization, management, supervision and coordination related
to the Project as well as monitoring the progress achieved. The Director-General of DNFE shall be
the Project Coordinator responsible for overall Project implementation; and by December 31, 1996
an additional eleven professional staff will be appointed to assist in the development of appropriate
planning, budgeting and monitoring systems for the expanded NFE system. By June 30, 1996 a
Project Implementation and Management Unit, within DNFE, will be adequately staffed with
personnel having experience and qualifications in finance, administration and procurement as well as
in operational functions. A Project Coordination Committee chaired by the Secretary, Primary and
Mass Education Division will be constituted by June 30, 1996 to be responsible for (a) coordinating
project activities among Government agencies, NGOs and other organizations in the Project; (b)
reviewing and approving policy adjustments; (c) monitoring the general progress of the Project; and
(d) reviewing and approving annual operational plans. NFE courses will provide literacy, numeracy
and life skills to classes scheduled at a time convenient to the learners in accommodation provided
by the community. NFE programs will be implemented in a phased manner in 30 districts selected
on the basis of criteria agreed between the Borrower and the Association, which shall include
literacy rates below 45%, community demand and availability of NGOs to deliver NFE programs to
young adults (Annex III, Project Coverage). At least 50 percent of participants will be female. The
delivery of NFE programs will be undertaken by NGOs fulfilling the selection criteria and with
records demonstrating effective literacy and community development programs. For the Total
Literacy Movement pilot programs in two districts, DNFE will submit to IDA, proposals identifying
the number, location and profile of the target population, established demand, mechanism for
delivery, implementation arrangements and itemized cost estimates. See Annex IV, lProject
Implementation Schedule.
15.        By September 30, 1996, DNFE will provide IDA with an updated costed five-year
program and financing plan for nonformal education that reflects the changing role of Government
and NGOs in the subsector. By March 31 each year, DNFE will provide a draft annuial operational
plan for IDA review during the joint IDA/ADB/SDC annual supervision visits. A Benefit
Monitoring and Evaluation (BME) system will be established to provide accurate and timely
feedback on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Project and to ensure appropriate
adjustments in project inputs and management during implementation (Annex V, Project
Performance Indicators and Monitoring Mechanisms). During project implementation there will be
one joint supervision mission annually undertaken by Government, IDA, ADB, and SDC to review
Government's annual operational and expenditures plans for the nonformal education program. The
Government, IDA, ADB and SDC will jointly undertake a mid-term review of the Project not later
than June 30, 1998. This will review the scope, design, implementation arrangements and other
relevant issues in the light of the Government's development strategies and policy framework and, if
necessary, recommend changes in the design or implementation of the Project.
16.        Proiect Sustainability. (a) Institutional Viability. To address the magniiude of
illiteracy in Bangladesh, a long-term model needs to be adopted to focus on basic education and
functional literacy. A permanent structure for NFE is therefore needed to plan, coor(linate, support
and monitor a national NFE program long term. The Project will assist in institutionalizing the
DNFE which will be financed under the Government's development budget during the Project cycle,
and transferred to the recurrent budget after project completion to ensure institutional sustainability.



- 6 -
The role of DNFE will be to ensure policy implementation, provision of technical support,
coordination and progress monitoring and the use of allocated funds. The implementation structure
will be decentralized. Management and implementation of programs will be carried out by NGOs
selected on the basis of previous experience and management capacity; and by selected district
administrations. Large NGOs already have the necessary management and administration structures;
smaller NGOs will be supported, as needed, through training in managing larger numbers of
programs and in budgetary procedures.
17.        (b) Financial Viability. The Project was designed to ensure financial viability of the
NFE program. Apart from some DNFE staff salaries, which are financed from Government's
revenue budget, delivery of NFE programs is wholly financed from the development budget. In
FY94/95, allocations for NFE were less than 1% of the education development budget but there is
agreement with Government that public expenditures on NFE will increase to a minimum of 5% of
the education budget by the end of the Project. This would be easily absorbed in the expected
growth of the education budget. Under the current NFE scheme, NGOs subsidize NFE delivery by
an estimated 10 to 15% and a key element in the cost-effectiveness of programs and containing
expenditures in the Project is utilizing NGOs to deliver programs. There is no cost recovery from
the individual beneficiaries as the target group is the poorest segment of society and it would pose a
barrier to access, particularly for women. However, beneficiary communities would make a
significant contribution by providing accommodation for NFE activities and items such as mats. By
using existing staff and institutional facilities of NGOs and others, the Project will be able to
provide the 12-month NFE course to the beneficiaries at a cost per learner of U S$12. The low cost
is a result of low direct operating costs, community provision of accommodation and low salaries
for part-time instructors. The NFE program consists of nine months instruction in literacy and life
skills followed by three months post-literacy reading and discussion groups. This accounts for
around 320 hours of literacy instruction which research findings indicate is the most cost-effective
way to achieve sustainable adult literacy.
18.        Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement. IDA has experience from the
ongoing Bangladesh General Education Project of support for eighteen NGOs providing primary
education programs to school-age children. Evidence from this program indicates that NGOs can
attract and retain children in schools and provide sound education programs. Weaknesses in
budgetary planning and management and preparation of proposals for financial support are being
met by additional training. The lessons from IDA-financed literacy projects in several African
countries and in Indonesia are that: (i) literacy instruction is often more successful when it is
combined with teaching practical skills like health and family life skills; (ii) while NGOs are often
effective literacy providers, they usually require strengthening to become executing agencies for
donor projects; and whilst NGOs receiving project subsidies often perform well. they have not
always been included in policy formulation for the subsector; (iii) documenting effective practice
requires systematic development of research and other kinds of technical capacity to serve the
community of literacy providers; (iv) the impact of literacy programs can be improved with better
targeting especially to youths who have been denied the opportunity to complete their studies; (v)
successful implementation is directly tied to Government commitment, recruitrnent of qualified
personnel, and full funding of agreed projects; and (vi) time and resources should be spent to
disseminate project goals and to prepare various interest groups for proposed changes.



- 7 -
19.       These lessons are being taken into account in the Project design. The content of the
NFE program includes health and family welfare skills and most NGOs involved in program
delivery would also be working in the communities on other development programs. NGOs will
contribute to policy, planning and coordinating decisions through participation in the National
Council for Primary and Mass Education; and through program development and monitoring. The
Project will target illiterate young adults; and in addition a number of alternative models will be
tested for cost-effectiveness and for targeting hard-to-reach groups. The need for qualified personnel
has been greatly emphasized during project preparation and the proposed Project components for
staff development and training will enhance institutional capacity. There is already high
Government commitment to increase literacy and the proposed social mobilization to disseminate
project goals and activities will strengthen community participation. In addition, intensive
monitoring would be an integral part of the Project to ensure that programs are implemented
satisfactorily and students perform well.
20.        Rationale for IDA Involvement. A key element of IDA's country strategy for
Bangladesh is human resource development and poverty alleviation through provision of basic
services. The proposed Project is consistent with the IDA Country Assistance Strategy discussed by
the Executive Directors on November 9, 1995 in which human resource development is a crucial
component for achieving the national goal of poverty alleviation and growth. An effective
nonformal education program would have a significant impact on adolescent and young adult
literacy and is expected to result in economic and social improvements. Although IDA has provided
extensive support to the formal education sector, it has not been extensively involved in nonformal
education. With such a large illiterate population and poorly skilled labor force, IDA's support for
NFE would complement and strengthen support for formal education.
21.        Recently IDA and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have moved towards a sharper
division of labor in human resource work with ADB taking the lead role in the nonformal education
subsector. IDA's participation would increase opportunity for sectoral policy dialogue with
Government to achieve medium and long-term goals. Cooperation with ADB furthers IDA's overall
sector role in supporting donor coordination and education policy formulation. The oroposed
Project will complement IDA's support for primary education through the ongoing General
Education Project and planned future assistance to primary education quality improvement.
22.        Agreed Actions. In addition to actions agreed for project implementation (see
paragraph 13 above), Government undertook these actions prior to negotiations: (a) institutionalized
the Integrated Nonformal Education Program as a Directorate of Nonformal Education and
appointed eleven additional professional level staff; (b) appointed a Project Director for the Project
Implementation and Management Unit; (c) provided IDA and ADB with a list of 30 districts where
NFE programs will be undertaken; and (d) acquired land for the ADB financed headquarters
building and ensured that the site selection and construction will be carried out in aczordance with
ADB's environmental requirements. Special conditions of effectiveness are that: (a) Giovemment
will establish a National Council for Primary and Mass Education; (b) all conditions precedent to
the effectiveness of the ADB Loan Agreement and the Swiss Grant Agreement have been fulfilled;
and (c) the Project Proforma for the carrying out of the Project have been approved ty the
Borrower.

23.        Poverty and Program Obiective Categories. Developing Bangladesh's scarce human
resources is a central tenet of the country's poverty reduction strategy. Literacy contributes to
poverty reduction both through increased productivity and higher earning capacity and by promoting
better living conditions - lower fertility, improved health, and higher child survival rates. There is a
strong positive relationship between illiteracy and poverty in Bangladesh; recent estimates show that
a high percentage of illiterate persons aged 15 to 24 years live in households with incomes below
the official poverty line. Even without further efforts to target the poor, the majority of project
beneficiaries are likely to be from poor households. But specific targeting measures are being
developed under the Project: initial efforts will focus on districts where less than 40 percent of the
target population can read and write (and, by implication, with high poverty levels). Also, at least
half of the beneficiaries will be females. Additional targeting measures will be developed in the
course of project implementation, as necessary, to ensure a high proportion of poor beneficiaries.
The Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation (BME) system will be used to monitor learning
achievements and assess the impact on social and economic characteristics of project beneficiaries.
The NFE program for young adults will be evaluated to determine the socio-economic impact. This
will include tracer studies and case studies of selected learners to determine the impact of the NFE
program on literacy, social awareness, and family and personal life.
24.        Environmental Aspects. On screening, the Project was determined to be in Category
C. No adverse impact on the environment is expected from this Project. On the contrary, the
Project could ease pressures on the environment in the long run by slowing down population growth
which is an expected outcome associated with increased female literacy rates.
25.        Participatory Approach. The Project supports participation and promotes feedback
from clients, communities and field workers. The National Council for Primary and Mass
Education will include representatives of government, NGOs and the community in its policy,
planning and coordinating role. NGOs will be involved in the design, delivery and monitoring of
programs. The community will participate in identifying learners, providing shelter for classes and
in recruiting teachers. Women will be encouraged to participate in planning an,i implementation of
project activities and female teachers will be hired to teach female groups.
26.        Proiect Beneficiaries and Benefits. Data from a socioeconomic pr )file of the
beneficiaries show that a typical learner will be poor and malnourished, live in the rural areas, own
no land or no significant quantum of land and assets, have little opportunity for occupational or
geographic mobility, be illiterate, and be only seasonally employed. If female, the learner is likely
to be married, may not use contraception and therefore will bear many children have malnourished
children, live a shorter life than men, have little decision-making power, and have limited mobility
outside the home. The content of the NFE program will be useful for both women and men; but
since women are traditionally responsible for the welfare of the family, the content will particularly
address their needs. Evidence from ongoing NFE programs for adults indicates a demand from
young adults, particularly females, who for economic reasons have been deprived of education in the
past. Women presently constitute 60-70% of the participants in NFE programs and their retention
rate is higher than for men. While the number of learners to be reached under -he Project may be a
small percentage of the total need (about 25% of illiterates in the age group 15 to 24 years), it is
estimated that this is the maximum expansion that can be undertaken with assuied quality of service



- 9 -
delivery. However, the Project will have a long-term impact on the remaining illiterates through the
enhanced institutional capacity of DNFE to manage national nonformal education on a large scale in
the future.
27.          Upon successful completion of the Project, Bangladesh would have stro ng
institutional capacity for implementing large-scale affordable literacy programs. There would be:
(a) proven adult literacy methodologies suitable for the country; (b) trained and experienced staff at
the central and local levels to handle literacy programs; (c) improved instructor knowledge and
delivery of programs; (d) stronger management and monitoring of programs; and (e) lo3ng-term
positive impact on health, nutrition and family planning.
28.        The benefit of delivering programs through NGOs reduces costs to government; builds
on the large network of NGOs in Bangladesh and their experiences of delivering literacy programs
in the context of community development activities. NGOs will benefit from additional resources to
extend their activities and will benefit from additional training in financial and prograin
management.
29.        The Project will contribute to poverty reduction and improvement of the status of
women by providing programs of literacy, numeracy, and life skills including nutrition, hygiene,
family planning, civic rights, and income-generating practices. These programs will benefit an
estimated 2.5 million illiterate adults, particularly females, who will have increased opportunities to
improve their productivity, to take advantage of income-generation activities, social services and
self-improvement activities.
30.        Risks. Project risks are associated with (a) DNFE's management capability to plan and
coordinate a large number of NGO implemented activities; (b) instructors' capability io facilitate
learning and ensure regular learner attendance; and (c) the long-term sustainability of literacy skills
in learners. There is a risk that DNFE's institutional capacity would be overstretched if NFE
programs are expanded too rapidly and there is inadequate monitoring and support fot NGOs. To
assist project management and timely implementation of programs, a detailed project
implementation plan has been prepared. In this plan, NFE delivery is phased to peak luring the
fourth and fifth years of the Project thus enabling a build-up of capacity. In addition, during project
implementation, annual operational plans will be prepared and jointly reviewed by Government,
IDA and ADB. Attendance and retention of participants in NFE programs are often poor due to
participants' family and community obligations; low motivation due to lack of relevanze and poor
teaching techniques. In order for the instructor to perform effectively he or she will need the
necessary tools, such as good training, relevant materials, supportive supervision and 8ssistance in
how to test learners. Sustainability of literacy is dependent on continued access to reading materials
and group discussions. The Project provides for revision of existing training program and materials,
development of post-literacy materials, and development of instruments to test learner performance.
In addition, annual assessment will be conducted on a sample basis to evaluate NGO and learner
performance. This will assist IDA and ADB to review progress and ensure that quality targets are
being met. Monitoring, piloting alternative methods and impact studies will be carriec out to
identify the most cost-effective manner to sustain literacy.

Annex I
MANAGEMENT OF NGO SERVICES
1.        The Directorate of Nonformal Education (DNFE), which is within the
Primary and Mass Education Division, will manage contracts with NGOs and
monitor their performance as implementing agencies. Among other tasks, the
DNFE will: (a) be responsible for implementation of NFE carried out by NGOs;
(b) administer, monitor and evaluate programs and channel funding to NGOs
carrying out NFE programs; and (c) provide technical services support on
program and material development and training to NGOs. The Director, Finance
and Administration, DNFE, will be responsible for handling IDA funds,
including compliance with IDA's guidelines for procurement, disbursement and
accounting requirements; the preparation of statements of accounts and
expenditures and overall project accounting and reporting.
2.        The project covers 30 districts and there will be more than one NGO
delivering programs in each district. The selection of districts for IDA
support to NGOs will be agreed at the time of joint IDA/ADB/Government annual
review of operational plans. NGOs will be selected and awarded contracts
annually on the basis of procedures acceptable to IDA. Where the amount of
contracts is less than US$120,000, then the first five contracts awarded in
each district will be subject to prior review by IDA in addition to the review
carried out by the Subvention Committee responsible for selection of NGOs.
3.        Criteria for NGOs selected to implement programs; procedures for
selection of NGOs; and Guidelines for NGOs seeking selection for pilot
programs are set out in Annex II. Project assistance will also include the
training and orientation of NGOs in finance and accounting procedures
acceptable to IDA. Each year, selected NGOs will be evaluated against
selection criteria, contract agreements and internal monitoring reports. This
evaluation will be carried out by an independent monitoring and evaluation
team contracted by DNFE.

SELECTION CRITERIA FOR NGOS
1.          All NFE delivery to be supported under the Project will need to satisfy criteria,
established by DNFE with respect to implementing NGOs. The Government and the Bank have
agreed upon the following criteria for NGO selection.
A.   Criteria for Qualifying NGOs
2.          NGOs will be qualified for selection on the basis of their past track record and the
capacity to perform NFE functions. The minimum criteria for qualifying are as follows:
(i)      The NGO must be registered with the Government; be a nonprofit and nonpolitical
organization; have a duly approved constitution as per relevant Registration Act
and hold elections regularly as provided for in the constitution; have a properly
constituted managing body with clearly defined roles and responsibilities of office
bearers; have an established/registered office with postal and local addresses,
and have been in existence for at least three years.
(ii)     The NGO must have a successful program and a network of infrastructure in the
operational/designated work area.  More specifically, the NGO must have
experience in fields relevant to NFE for at least two consecutive years. The NGO
must have demonstrated skills in community level NFE and familiarity with the
conditions of the beneficiary groups. Preference will be given to NGOs that have
integrated development programs and/or programs for the promotion of women.
In addition, the NGO must have trained managerial staff and teaching personnel
for NFE; have or can arrange for adequate facilities for holding classes; and be
able to undertake baseline surveys, prepare a beneficiary profile, and maintain its
own data base.
(iii)    The NGO must demonstrate management capability in terms of planning,
programming, and budgeting projects; and have in place adequate accounting
systems and procedures to ensure timely disbursement and liquidation of funds,
and adequate staffing to undertake the field extension work. More specifically, the
NGO must have a system of maintaining accounts for audit and a progress
reporting system on project implementation
(iv)     The NGO  must have the ability/provision to bear the overhead costs
(maintenance/office salaries/wages of management personnel, etc.) from its own
resources and must not seek or receive funds from more than one foreign source
for the same program in the same area.
B.   Procedure for Selection of NGOs

C.   Subproject Proposal Guidelines for Pilot Projects
4.          NGOs seeking subproject selection for piloting alternative NFE models,
approaches, and materials must meet the following criteria pertaining to the proposed learning
activities.
(i)      The proposals must clearly identify the number, location, and profile of the target
population and indicate how this population represents the priority population for
the subproject (gender, literacy, and poverty indicators).
(ii)     The proposal should clearly present its approach to alternative NFE program
development and implementation. It should describethe general approach to NFE
proposed for piloting; present the methods for identifying, mobilizing, and
enrolling learners in the pilot project; describe clearly the curriculum, instructional
methods, and/or materials to be piloted; present its plans for teacher preparation
(including teachertraining curriculum, materials, and approaches) and supervision
under the pilot; present a clear strategy for maintaining quality standards during
the pilot through systematic monitoring and supervision; and evaluate program
and learner performance against predetermined criteria. The proposal should
provide some indicative strategies on how to replicate the alternative program and
sustain its activities.
(iii)    The proposal must provide itemized cost estimates according to the guidelines
provided by DNFE. These items should be in one of the following categories: (i)
direct implementation support; or (ii) developmental costs: baseline surveys,
community orientation workshops, and costs for adapting learning and teaching
materials.
