REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE CENTRAL BANK
OF THE PHILIPPINES
TO BE GUARANTEED
BY THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR THE THIRD RURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for an equivalent of US$22.0 million to the Central Bank of the
Philippines to be guaranteed by the Republic of the Philippines. The
Central Bank would relend the proceeds of the loan to participating banks
which would in turn lend the money to farmers and entrepreneurs for pur-
chasing equipment and machinery for agriculture and fishery productions.
The loan would have a term of 14 years including 4 years of grace with
interest at 7-1/4% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent Economic Report - "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Philippines" (No. 78-PH of April 20, 1973) was circulated
to the Executive Directors on May 2, 1973 (R73-85). An economic mission
visited the Philippines in April and its preliminary conclusions are
incorporated below. The full report of the mission will be distributed to
the Executive Directors in due course. Annex I contains country data.
Recent Developments
3.        Since 1972, the Government has re-formulated its development
strategy by introducing a number of important and potentially far-reaching
economic and social reforms through decrees in such areas as agrarian reform,
taxation, customs administration and tariffs, banking and government organi-
zation. These reforms provide an opportunity to improve the performance of
the Philippine economy. Aided by the recent commodity boom in the inter-
national markets, economic activity in the Philippines has increased consid-
erably. The growth in real GNP, which had been about 5% a year for more
than a decade, is estimated to have doubled and reached 10% in 1973. However
underemployment and unemployment remain quite high, and in common with most
other countries the rate of inflation has incr'eased appreciably in the past
year. These problems and the long-term implications of the energy crisis
for domestic production, the balance of payments, costs and employment are
now being examined by the economic mission.
4.        The strong recovery of the economy in 1973 resulted from increased
agricultural production, a recovery in the industrial sector including
manufactured exports, a boom in export incomes and an expansion in public
and private investment. The agricultural sector, which had suffered from
adverse weather conditions during the previous three years grew by 11% ini
1973. Rice production in the present crop year is estimated to have increased
by 30% over the level of the previous year when floods reduced production
levels. This increase has been mainly due to favorable weather conditions,



- 2 -
increased use of fertilizers, more supervised credit and increased investments
in supporting rural services as part of a general drive for rice self-suffi-
ciency. The Government has vigorously implemented a program of agrarian re-
form among rice and corn tenants concentrating mainly on the larger holdings
in the first phase. Titles are being transferred to tenants and supporting
services improved.
5.        The increased activity in agriculture has provided the base for
renewed expansion of the industrial sector. The growth of industrial produc-
tion for exports has also been stimulated by the Government's industrial
export drive which included a range of export incentives. Nontraditional
industrial exports, which have been increasing since 1970, are estimated to
have doubled in 1973 to about $200 million. The prospects of increased
profitability are attracting a large amount of new investment into industries
such as plywood, textiles and garments, handicrafts, light consumer durables
and electronics.
6.        The growth in production was also assisted by the sharply acceler-
ated public development outlays in 1973 made possible by a significant im-
provement in the financial position of the Government. The Government has
implemented a series of long-needed tax reforms and improvements in tax
administration, such as customs and tariff reform, tax amnesties, reforms
in corporate and local taxation, continuation of the export tax, and increased
taxation on luxury items and on gasoline. These reforms resulted in a 37%
increase in tax revenues in FY 1973, and an estimated 40% this fiscal year.
As a result the ratio of Central Government tax revenues to GNP has increased
from an average of 9% in recent years to an estimated 12% this fiscal year.
7.        high prices for the Philippines' chief exports, including coconut
products, sugar, copper and wood products, were largely responsible for an
increase in merchandise receipts of almost 70% in 1973. The merchandise
trade account recorded a surplus of about $270 million, as compared with a
$120 million deficit in the previous year. International reserves rose by
$594 million during the year and stood at $876 million, equivalent to about
five months of imports, at the end of the year.
8.        However, in the latter part of 1973 inflation emerged as a major
problem in the Philippines. Since mid-1973 consumer prices have been rising
at an annual rate of more than 40%. This has been caused by the higher rate
of world inflation, by higher export prices, by domestic food shortages, and
more recently by the increased cost of petroleum. Provided the Government
obtains sufficient cereal imports for the coming July-September lean period
for domestic supplies, and provided there is a good harvest later in the
year, the rate of inflation should moderate in 1975, but it probably will
take 1-2 years for the price effects of thie energy crisis to work themselves
out fully. The rapid inflation has also exacerbated the decline in real
wages which fell by a total of about 25% between 1969 and 1973. The urban
wage earners have been most affected. In the past year, agricultural incomes
have improved very substantially, while, with some exceptions, entrepreneurs
have been able to pass on increased costs. Money wages will have to be raised
in the near future if further deterioration in the living standards of wage
earners is to be avoided.



-3-
The Ener gyCrisis
9.        Imported petroleum provides some 93% of the Philippines' total
energy requirements. In 1973 the equivalent of 71 million barrels of
petroleum crude and other petroleum products were imported at a cost of
about $230 million c.i.f. When the energy crisis developed late last year,
it looked as though economic activity in the Philippines would be severely
disrupted. There were temporary dislocations while reduced quantities of
petroleum were available, but the Government moved quickly with conservation
measures to reduce non-essential consumption. By March these problems had
been overcome and the Philippines is now obtaining sufficient petroleum for
its needs. In 1974 imports of petroleum and products are likely to be about
73 million barrels at a cost of about $820 million c.i.f.
10.       In response to the energy crisis the Government has decided to
accelerate the development of local energy sources, especially hydropower
and geothermal energy. These will be supplemented with nuclear energy in
the 1980's. The transport sector, which now accounts for 40% of total
energy consumption, is likely to continue to be the major consumer of energy.
The growth in demand for energy will therefore be influenced by policies
that affect the pattern of expansion in this sector. In any event, total
demand for energy is expected to grow at about 10 percent a year, and even
with more rapid development of natural power sources, petroleum would still
account for 85% of total energy needs by 1980. The Philippines does not
have any commercial oil fields, but the Government has recently taken steps
to encourage more exploration.
Growth Prospects
11.       Earlier this year the Government decided that, despite the energy
crisis and rapid inflation, the growth momentum built up last year should be
maintained, to provide for a continued increase in employment and to ensure
that export income expands rapidly enough to meet most of the country's for-
eign exchange needs. The labor force will continue to grow at almost 3% a
year for another decade. Providing half a million new jobs a year as well
as dealing with unemployment and underemployment will be a major task.
12.       The economy has the potential to continue growing at 7-8% a year
in real terms. This growth is not likely to be seriously constrained by lack
of foreign exchange, for despite the big increase in the cost of petroleum
and other imports, continued high prices for major export commodities will
result in another overall balance of payments surplus this year. Moreover,
the rapid increase in export prices at a time when external debt has not been
changing, has resulted in a sharp fall in debt service from 23% of export
earnings in 1972 to an estimated 14% this year. There has also been a sub-
stantial improvement in the climate for private investment in the Philippines,
especially in exports. Unless there is a calamitous drop in export prices,
the Philippines should be able to maintain a reasonable balance of payments
position throughout the rest of the decade. There will probably be a substan-
tial increase in financing requirements, but with rising domestic incomes and
a substantially improved capacity to borrow abroad, it should be possible
to mobilize the needed resources.



-4-
13.       A substantial increase in both public and private investment to
support the growth and employment strategy is required, with priority being
given to increasing food production, tc, export ventures and to selective
import-replacing investments. The Government plans to spend about P 17 bil-
lion on infrastructure and other public investments during FY 1974-77; about
40% of the proposed investment program would be allocated to the transport
sector, 21% to power and 13% to irrigation. This would mean doubling the pro-
portion of these expenditures to GNP from 1.7% in FY 1968-72 to about 3.5%
in FY 1974-77. To finance this program, the ratio of taxes to GNP would
have to be increased to 15-16%, and public savings would have to be raised
from the present level of 1.4% of GNP to beyond 2% in the next few years.
With the Government's program for further tax reforms, there are reasonable
prospects for achieving these objectives. Even so, it would mean continued
heavy reliance on public borrowing from the local market and from abroad.
Implementing this program would also call for continued improvements in
public sector management which has already been strengthened by the Govern-
ment reorganization.
14.       The improved climate for private investment is attributable to the
strong performance of the economy in 1973 after three years of stagnation,
the current higher prices for many commodities, and the efforts of Govern-
ment to attract more foreign investment. A number of big projects are pro-
posed in mining, wood processing, fertilizer, steel, aluminum and other
industries which seem likely to push up the private investment rate from
recent levels of about 16% of GNP to perhaps 22% by the latter part of the
decade. A large portion of the funds for these projects is likely to come
from abroad. Even so, the supply of long-term funds from domestic sources
will need to increase substantially.
Balance of Payments
15.       Because of continued high prices for major export commodities,
export receipts are expected to increase by 33% this year to $2.5 billion.
Merchandise imports are likely to increase by about 66% to $2.6 billion,
largely because of the increased cost of petroleum. In response to the
energy crisis the Central Bank negotiated a series of standby credits with
various foreign commercial banking groups earlier this year. However, be-
cause of the improved outlook for export receipts, these standby credits may
not be used this year. The economic mission estimates that the overall
balance of payments will record a surplus of about $250 million this year,
with international reserves increasing to about $1.1 billion, the equivalent
of about 3-1/2 months of imports. With export prices continuing at relatively
high levels, a small deficit in the overall balance of payments is likely in
1975.
16.       After allowing for continued reserve accumulation and repayment of
loans, the total foreign exchange requirements for the period 1975-79 would
be about $7 billion. About $2.5 billion would be provided by remittances,
official grants, direct investment, and short-term trade finance. The re-
maining $4.5 billion would have to come from foreign borrowing. Last year
the Bank estimated total requirements for 1974-78 at about $4 billion. In



June 1973 the Consultative Group for the Philippines met and accepted the
need for rising levels of commitments for development projects to support
the Philippines' increased development program. The increased estimate of
requirements reflects the effects of inflation, the more optimistic outlook
for growth in the Philippines, and the improved capacity to carry foreign
debt.
17.       Borrowing on this scale would not pose serious problems for balance
of payments and external debt management. At the end of 1973, the Philippines'
medium and long-term external debt stood at about $1.9 billion, of which pub-
lic debt was 44%. Because the Government has exercised strict control over
the amount and type of new external borrowings, the total amount of debt out-
standing has not increased much since 1970, and the maturity structure has
improved. Moreover, the debt service ratio is expected to remain at about
14% in 1975. With this moderate debt burden the Philippines will be able to
contract substantially larger amounts of external debt which would probably
lead to a small increase in the debt service ratio, perhaps to about 14-15%
by the early 1980s.
18.       The Philippines' development program will continue to require re-
sources in excess of the foreign capital which will become available for fi-
nancing the import component of development projects.. Some financing of local
currency expenditures will be justified, especially for projects of economic
and social importance which need only limited amounts of foreign exchange.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
19.       The Philippines has received 23 Bank loans and three IDA credits
totalling $394 million, net of cancellations. About 56% of the Bank/IDA
lending or about $225 million has been for infrastructure projects in power,
transportation, water supply and for education. The remainder has been
divided between agriculture and industry. About $104 million of this has
been for irrigation, livestock, fisheries, rice processing and rural credit
and about $65 million for industry in three loans to the Private Development
Corporation of the Philippines. There has been a marked improvement in the
way Bank Group projects in the Philippines have been executed in the last
two or three years compared with experience in the 1960's when shortages
of peso counterpart funds combined with poor administration caused serious
problems. Apart from the rice processing project, where the scope of the
project has been revised because of changed circumstances (see Annex II),
all our projects are now going well. Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans and IDA credits as of April 30, 1974 and IFC investments as of
March 31, 1974, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
20.       The size of the Bank's lending program will increase substantially
this year reflecting the ambitious development program of the Government and
its improved capacity to prepare and implement projects. With the loans for
the proposed project and for the industrial investment project being presented



- 6 -
to the Executive Directors in June, our lending in FY 1974 would be $165.1
million, co-npared to an average of about $30 million a year in the previous
five years. Future Bank lending will continue to concentrate on public in-
frastructure and agriculture. We will also continue to help industry and
provide more assistance for projects in the social sectors.
21.       The following projects are among those which may be ready for Board
consideration in FY 75 - Population, Power VI, Inter-Island Shipping, Tarlac
Irrigation, Mindoro Rural Development and Small Industry. The population
project would strengthen the delivery of family planning and other health
services to the rural areas, mainly by constructing and staffing new rural
health units. The sixth power loan would help the National Power Corporation
(NPC) to expand its power generating and transmission facilities in Luzon,
while the loan for inter-island shipping would be relent through DBP to
private shipping companies for the acquisition of new and used ships and con-
version and repairs of existing ships of the inter-island fleet. The Tarlac
Irrigation project would help rehabilitate irrigation systems in a heavily
tenanted area of Central Luzon, while the Rural Development project would
help finance a range of rural investments designed to promote the integrated
development of the island of M4indoro. The small industry loan would provide
funds for relending to small firms and technical assistance to help strengthen
the institutions serving these firms.
22.       Since 1972 the Philippines has received a limited amount of assist-
ance from IDA, but on the basis of a reappraisal of the prospects for the
Philippines' balance of payments in the light of changes in commodity prices,
and in view of the sharply increased needs of the poorer members of IDA for
concessional assistance, further IDA lending to the Philippines does not
appear to be justified. The Philippines now has the capacity to borrow
larger amounts abroad to meet the needs of the increased investment program
now planned. The Bank's share in this higher level of foreign borrowing
will be reviewed in the light of the findings of the recent economic mission.
At present, the Bank/IDA share in total debt outstanding is about 9% and its
share in debt service is about 5.5%. Since the Philippines will have the
capacity to service more commercial debt in future, it is unlikely that the
Bank's share in debt service will rise even with a higher level of lending.
23.       IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $68.0 mil-
lion for investments in ten companies in the fields of development banking,
power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products, nickel
mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these investments,
as of March 31, 1974, $18.2 million have been sold, $0.4 million cancelled
and $1.6 million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $47.8 million. On the
same date $13.2 million was undisbursed. Preliminary proposals have been
received for an aluminum smelter and other projects in the pulp and paper,
dinner ware, metal alloys and shipbuilding fields.

PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
24.       Agriculture is the predominant sector in the Philippine economy
generating approximately one-third of the gross national product, accounting
for one-half of total employment and about three-quarters of export earnings.
Over 60% of the total land under cultivation is taken up by cereals, of which
rice and corn are the most important. The remaining land is primarily taken
up by the major export crops: sugar, coconuts, abaca, pineapples and tobacco.
25.       During the first half of the last decade, agricultural production
increased by only 2.4% a year. However, with a breakthrough in rice produc-
tion following the increased use of high-yielding varieties, fertilizers and
irrigation in the sixties, the sector was growing at a rate of almost 7% a
year by the latter part of the decade. During the past three years the
sector has suffered from adverse weather conditions including severe typhoons.
These disasters slowed progress towards self-sufficiency in food crops and
imports of about 600,000 tons of rice were needed in 1972 and 1973. However,
due to favorable weather conditions and a crash rice production program
called "Masagana 99", 1/ a harvest of 3.7 million tons of milled rice equiv-
alent is expected this year - an increase of 30% over the 1972/73 harvest.
In this past year, fertilizer use on food crops (mostly rice) tripled and
supervised credit increased almost eight fold.
26.       The major export crops have not been seriously affected by the
natural calamities and have provided increasing foreign exchange revenues
mainly because of favorable world commodity prices. Livestock and poultry
production, which accounts for about 15% of agricultural output, is not suf-
ficient to meet the demand for meat, requiring imports of about $6 million
a year.
27.       The performance of the rural-agricultural sector will be crucial
in determining whether the Philippines can increase incomes both rapidly
and equitably. At present, the domestic market for industrial products is
limited by relatively low rural incomes. Problems of poverty and income
maldistribution are particularly acute in the rural areas. Of the 15 mil-
lion people in the bottom 40% of the income scale, 12 million live in rural
areas. This represents 45% of the rural population. The Government is
aware of these problems and is moving in the right direction by stressing
self-sufficiency in cereals, laying the base for future diversification,
reforming the tenancy structure, and increasing institutional support to
agriculture.
1/   "Masagana 99" is a drive by Government with a target of achieving
99 cavans of paddy per hectare (4.4 tons/ha) country wide. In
Tagalog "masagana" means abundant.



28.       Achieving self-sufficiency in cereals, particularly rice and maize,
is a major Government objective which is important not only to strengthen
the balance of payments, but also as a means of raising incomes for an im-
portant segment of the rural population. Most increases in rice production
will have to come primarily from the present land under cultivation since
the scope for area expansion in rice is very limited. Thus, attaining self-
sufficiency before the end of the pr2sent decade will depend largely on in-
creasing yields through expansion and rehabilitation of the area under irri-
gation, increased use of fertilizers and agro-chemicals, and provision of
adequate credit and other supporting services. At present, only 900,000 ha
or less than 30% of all land under rice cultivation is irrigated. Invest-
ment in irrigation is therefore of high priority. According to the Bank's
Philippines Agricultural Sector Survey of May 2, 1973, meeting the domestic
demand for rice by the end of the 1970's will require a program of irrigation
rehabilitation and new construction in rice lands involving 50,000 ha a year
for the remainder of the decade.
29.       Apart from rice, considerable potential also exists in feed grain
and corn production, livestock, fisheries and forestry development. Diversi-
fication is important not only to meet the growing domestic demand for food
and raw materials, but also to improve incomes in poor areas less suited to
rice production. Better conservation of natural resources can be achieved by
developing the livestock and forestry potential of uplands not suitable for
cultivation.
30.       Institutional support for agriculture will involve greater atten-
tion to rural credit, agricultural extension, research and development of
infrastructure. There has been considerable progress in developing institu-
tions to provide credit for small farmers, most notably the rural banks and,
after many years of slow progress, the Government is giving high priority
to agrarian reform. The present program concentrates on rice and corn
tenant farmers, who number about one million, and includes the transfer of
titles from landlords to tenants, an expanded program of rural credit, and
increased investments in supporting rural services. In the first year of
the new program the Government has concentrated its efforts on the large
tenanted estates. It has issued 205,000 land transfer certificates to about
143,000 tenant farmers who cultivate about 255,000 hectares of land. More
has been accomplished in this year than in the previous 10 years when a
total of 55,000 tenants were converted to leasehold status and 3,000 to
freehold status. The Government faces some difficult problems in dealing
with small landholdings which are tenanted. Some 82% of land owners have
7 ha or less and 34% of all rice tenants are on these holdings. The latest
directives suggest that small landowners who cultivate part of their holdings
would be expected to enter into cooperative arrangements with their tenants.
It is not yet clear how far the Government will go in requiring small ab-
sentee landlords to transfer their land to their tenants. Since over 80%
of all farms are under five hectares, the future growth in agriculture which
would result from the expansion of irrigated land would directly benefit the
small farmers.



- 9 -
31.       According to the Government's Four Year Plan (1974-77) projections
the agricultural sector, after two successive poor rice crops in 1972-73,
is expected to post significant gains in 1974 with a 4.8% growth rate. By
the end of the Plan period, agricultural production is expected to be growing
at 4.5% per annum. Export crops are expected to perform well. However, the
recent increase in the price of petroleum with its effect on the price of
fertilizer and the amount available poses a difficult problem for the Govern-
ment. The use of fertilizers on rice alone increased from 44,000 on the wet
season crop in 1972 to 162,000 tons in 1973. Prices were held at the 1972
level by subsidy. Based on planned programs for rice and cozn, fertilizer
requirements will rise perhaps by 250,000 tons most of which will represent
additional import requirements. Government officials indicate that most of
the 1974 fertilizer requirements have been contracted for, and the price of
fertilizers has doubled despite the subsidies. The impact on the farmer of
this increase has partly been cushioned by an increase in the support price
of paddy by 50% to F 40 for 50 Kg. In order to maintain the incentives for
increased use of fertilizers by farmers, the Government may have to raise
paddy prices further and/or increase the subsidies. In addition more credit
will be needed as a result of higher fertilizer prices. The Government has
therefore decided to increase the level of credit to food farmers under the
"Masagana 99" program from P 570 per hectare in 1973 to P 900 in 1974 - an
increase of about 40%. This increase does not apply to fertilizers used for
export crops because of continued high international prices of these crops.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       The project is the third rural credit project to be financed by
the Bank. The first one was in 1965 when the Bank made a loan of $5.0 mil-
lion equivalent (432-PH). This loan was fully disbursed by 1968. In June
1969, the Bank made a loan of $12.5 million equivalent for the second rural
credit project. This loan is expected to be fully disbursed by mid 1974.
Both projects have progressed satisfactorily although disbursement under the
second project was slow at the beginning. The proposed project was prepared
by the Department of Rural Banks and Savings and Loan Associations, Central
Bank of the Philippines. A Bank mission appraised the project in November/
December 1973 and negotiations were held in Ma 1974. The leader of the
Philippine negotiating team was Mr. A. P. de Roda, Under-Secretary of
Finance. The Appraisal Report (No. 428a-PH) on the project is being cir-
culated separately to the Executive Directors. Annex III provides a loan
and project summary.
The Rural Banks
33.       The Government has over the years actively encouraged and promoted
rural banks in order to provide rural areas with banking facilities. The
Philippines is the only country in Asia that has this type of rural banking
system. Rural Banks are private banks established with authority of the
Central Bank. At present the Government holds 40% of their stock with



- 10 -
individuals holding the balance. Rural Banks sources of funds are from
paid up capital, deposits from the public, borrowings from the Central Bank
and profits from lending operations. In addition, they have rediscounting
facilities with the Central Bank for short term agricultural lending. Through
these facilities the Central Bank rediscounts promissory notes up to 80%
under ordinary schemes and 100% under supervised production schemes (rice,
corn and sugar) at 3% a year up to a limit of 300% of the borrowing bank's
net worth plus 50% of its monthly average savings deposits over the preced-
ing four months.
34.       The rural banking system, with its large number of outlets, is
well equipped to meet a substantial part of the farmers' growing needs for
short, medium and long term credit.   Of the P 361.0 million short term
credit provided to about 400,000 farmers under the Government's "Masagana 99"
program in 1973 (see para 16 above), 45'% was provided by rural banks, 50%
by commercial banks, mainly the Government owned Philippine National Bank,
and 5% by the Agricultural Credit Administration. Rural banks are the pre-
dominant source of long term development credit for small and medium size
farmers in the one to ten hectare range.
35.       The first and second rural credit loans have supported the Central
Bank in its efforts to strengthen the rural banks by requiring them to oper-
ate at appropriate standards, and by providing them with technical assist-
ance. The loans, therefore, played a significant role in building up these
lending institutions. A unique aspect of the rural banking system has been
the mobilization of local personnel of different backgrounds who, after
periods of training and supervision, have been transformed into satisfactory
bankers.
36.       In 1965 when the Bank made the first loan for a rural credit
project, there were 300 rural banks. By 1969, with the second loan, the
number had increased to 400 and now there are over 600 of them. It is
planned to establish 100 rural banks per year between now and 1977. Some
140 of these institutions participated in the first loan and just over 200
are now participating in the second loan. About 250 are expected to par-
ticipate in the proposed third loan.
37.       Arrears of participating banks under the first and second IBRD
financed Rural Credit Projects have been deteriorating. In 1971 overdues
under the on-going project amounted to P 0.6 million out of a total port-
folio of P 15.2 million. The corresponding figure for 1973 (as of September)
was P 4.5 million out of P 80.0 million. To qualify as participants, the
overdues of a rural bank had to be less than 25% of its loan portfolio and
most banks were able to qualify as their portfolio kept expanding. As the
banks portfolios have been expanding rapidly, this ratio is no longer satis-
factory as a measure of the rate of collection of loans as they fall due.
Under the proposed project, the participating banks would be required to
have arrears not exceeding 25% of demand, arrears being defined as "amounts
due at the end of a twelve-month period as a percentage of demand" and demand
being defined as "principal and interest falling due during the period plus
overdues at the beginning of the period". This formula requires collections



- 11 -
to be improved markedly, and, if applied immediately, a large number of rural
banks would be disqualified. The new formula would, therefore, come into
effect on April 1, 1975. Before that date, each participating bank would be
required to demonstrate, on the basis of its accounts for the previous calen-
dar year or of its subsequent monthly financial reports, that its arrears were
25% or less of demand. If it failed to demonstrate this, the bank would be
disqualified until it was able to reduce the arrears to the required level
or below. The applicable maximum rate of arrears would be reduced to 20%
of demand effective a year later, on April 1, 1976. During the transition
period until the effectiveness of this new requirement the current formula
for maximum arrears, defined as 25% of total loan portfolio, would continue
to apply.
Stock Savings and Loan Associations
38.       The Central Bank has proposed that certain Stock Savings and Loan
Associations be permitted to participate in the project. These institutions
are registered with the approval of the Central Bank. Unlike rural banks,
they can open branches. They accept deposits from the public and make loans.
Savings and loan associations have so far concentrated on financing real prop-
erty and there are now 35 of them including 14 in Greater Manila and 7 with
branches. Twenty of the existing savings and loan associations are interested
in broadening their operations to include medium and long term lending to
agriculture for productive purposes, arnd the Government is keen that they
should do so in order to increase the number of outlets providing institu-
tional crenit to farmers. Since they would meet the standards required for
rural banks to participate in the project, the Bank agreed with the Central
Bank's proposal that these institutions be permitted to participate in the
project.
Description of the Proiect
39.       The purpose of the project is to finance investment in a range of
agricultural and rural activities throughout the Philippines. The farmers
who would borrow under the project would be mainly those cultivating between
two and ten hectares. Large farmers owning or cultivating over 50 hectares
would not be eligible to borrow under the project. The project would finance
the following activities:
(i) Farm Mechanization. This category would include about
1,800 imported four-wheel tractors of up to 80 BHP with
accessories and implements, and 1,000 domestically manu-
factured power tillers. They would be mainly used in
sugarcane and irrigated rice farming areas, and on some
upland corn farms. It would help sugarcane farmers to
increase their yield, rice farmers to increase their
cropping intensity, and corn farmers to extend their
land under cultivation. Benefits would accrue not only
to owner/operators but also to small farmers using their
services.



- 12 -
(ii)  On-farm Tranpo rtation.   This category would include
about 250 new and 200 imported reconditioned trucks to
alleviate the existing shortage of farm transport. The
trucks would help increase the recovery of rice and
sugar from paddy and sugarcane by reducing the waiting
time before milling, and improve farmers' bargaining
position vis-a-vis middlemen.
(iii)  Farm Support Facilities and Equipment.    This category
would include 250 privately owned farm machinery repair
shops and purchase of minor farm equipment such as
sprayer/dusters, tractor and power tiller implements
and attachments, grain driers, and threshers of up to
13 tons per day, and the construction and equipping of
small scale private irrigation facilities and storage.
(iv)  Coastal and Inland Fisheries.   Fishery development would
cover the construction of inland fishponds and fishpens,
and purchase of about 300 small coastal fishing boats and
equipment. Boats would be bought by local entrepreneurs,
and crewed by local fishermen, who would share the catches.
(v)  Small Scale Livestock Development.   Small-scale poultry,
swine and dairy farm development would include the construc-
tion of pens and sheds, and the purchase of initial stocks.
(vi)  Cottage Aro-Industries.    This category would include a
limited number of cottage agro-industries for production
of fishmeal for import substitution, and labor-intensive
woodcraft products for export. It would help the rural
banks diversify their lending operations into cottage indus-
tries.
(vii)  Evaluation StuLdy.  The project would include finance for
a study to be undertaken by a group of qualified local
experts, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank,
to review the progress and assess the economic and financial
impact of the first, second and this project.
Project Execution
40.       As in the previous two projects the Central Bank, through its
Department of Rural Banks and Savings and Loan Associations, would administer
the project. The Department is competently managed by a Director and an
Associate Director and has a staff of about 500. The Department's Special
Agricultural Projects Division assisted by loan teams and technicians in
the field, would process and sanction loan applications submitted through
the rural banks and savings and loan associations. It has currently 62 ag-
ricultural and 12 fisheries technicians in the field. Ten of the fisheries
technicians, who are seconded from the Fisheries Commission, would be re-
tained by the Central Bank through project implementation in order to process



- 13 -
fisheries loans. A Technical Support Evaluation Unit would be established
as a Division in the Department. Its ftnction would be to keep in touch
with agencies and research institutions concerned with agricultural and
fisheries development, collect information on project development, dissemi-
nate such information, provide technical guidance to management and field
staff, monitor project operations, and evaluate the results at the farm
level. In order to encourage small loans by speeding up processing, sim-
plified procedures requiring less work by the Central Bank field staff and
less paperwork for final Central Bank approval, would be introduced for
loans of up to P 10,000 ($1,400).
Prq,iect Cost and Financinp,
41.       The total project cost for the proposed three year lending pro-
gram is estimated at $44 million equivalent with an estimated foreign
exchange cost of $22 million. The Bank would finance 50%, the Government
30%, the participating rural banks and Savings and Loan Associations 10%
on average - new rural banks and savings and loan associations with lim-
ited resources would be permitted to contribute a minimum of 5% - and
the beneficiaries 10%. The Central Bank would combine the proceeds of
the loan (other than a small amount -- $90,000 -- required for a study to
evaluate the economic and financial impact of the project) with loans from
the Government covering 30% of project cost, and relend the funds to quali-
fied rural banks and savings and loan associations at an interest rate of
7% per annum. The Government loans to the Central Bank carry an interest
rate of 5% per annum. The relending rate of 7% on the combined proceeds
gives the Central Bank a margin of about 0.6% per annum. The rural banks
and savings and loan associations would in turn lend the funds to bene-
ficiaries at an interest rate of 12% per annum and on terms ranging from
three to ten years, including a grace period if required. Given the size
of the individual rural banks, the relatively large number of small loans
and the need to provide the banks with an incentive to participate in the
project, this 5% spread is reasonable even when account is taken of serv-
ices proviced by the Central Bank. The Central Bank would carry the foreign
exchange risk.
Procurement.
42.       As in the second project, machinery and equipment, including trucks
and irrigation equipment, and engines and equipment for fishing boats would
be purchased locally from firms representing major international manufactur-
ers, who maintain branches and dealers throughout the Philippines. Compe-
tition is keen, and services and repair facilities are satisfactory. The
firms submit their selling prices regularly to the Department of Rural Banks
and Savings and Loan Associations, which advises participating lending insti-
tutions and farmers on prices and mark-ups. Farmers would choose the firm
they prefer for their purchases.
43.       Sufficient private contractors are available for construction of
farm buildings and boats. Building materials, including lumber and cement,
are produced locally. Farmers and fishermen would choose their contractor



- 14 -
for construction and for equipment supply. The size of individual contracts
would be too small for international competitive bidding to be practicable.
Sub-projects would be widely dispersed in different regions and spread over
time so that bulking would not be workable.
Disbursements
44.       Disbursements would be made to the Central Bank against 56% of
loans to beneficiaries (maximum of 50% of investment cost) as disbursed by
rural banks and savings and loan associations upon submission of documen-
tation by the Central Bank. In addition the ,ank would disburse 100% of
the cost of the evaluation study.   Documentation of disbursements certified
by Central Bank Loan Officers would be retained on file at the Central Bank,
or a designated local depository. Since the second rural credit loan was
almost fully committed for sub-projects by the end of March 1974, eligible
sub-loans made after April 1, 1974 would qualify for retroactive disbursement
from the third loan in order to avoid holding up lending operations at a time
when the regular planting season is approaching. This retroactive financing
would not exceed $500,000 and would be provided only for sub-loans which are
eligible urnder the conditions of both the second and third rural credit
projects.
Collateral for Loans
45.       Loans to agrarian reform beneficiaries who cannot provide colla-
teral comparable to freehold title fully acceptable to the lending insti-
tutions would be guaranteed by the Agrarian Reform Fund (ARF). The fund
would also guarantee loans for fisheries development.
Economic Justification
46.       The direct benefit from the proposed project would derive from
the increase in production resulting from the various investments. For
example, farm mechanization would help increase rice production and hence
move the Philippines closer to self-sufficiency, and would also increase
sugar cane production thus helping to mneet the country's increasing
domestic demand and export requirements. The increased production in
poultry, pork, dairy and fish products would generate additional sources
of income to small farmers and help improve nutritional standards in rural
areas. Investments in cottage-agro-industries would stimulate export of
woodcraft products and reduce imports of fish meal products. Economic
rates of return for the different types of investment range from 33% to
over 100%.
47.       The estimated total annual incremental income accruing to the
approximately 8,000 farmers, fishermen and rural enterpreneurs who will
borrow under the project would be about P 100 million (US$14.7 million)
after paying P 32 million (US$4.7 million) in interest. The average
beneficiary's annual incremental net income would be about P 12,500
(US$1,800). About 94,000 small farmers would hire project financed
tractors from their owners for land preparation, and would thus profit



- 15 -
from custom work at reasonable rates. Most of these hirers are too poor to
own buffalo or power tillers, and depend on custom work. Without the proj-
ect, custom rates could rise sharply, and hirers would probably have to pay
much more than the P 140 per ha for rice farms projected under the project.
In addition, the project would create about 2,000 full-time job opportunities
for small subsistence fishermen, and equip a further 2,000 with more effi-
cient boats and fishing gear.
48.       The net employment effect of the farm mechanization component
would probably be some increase in the employment of hired labour. In the
rice sector, mechanical land preparation is expected to increase cropping
intensity and, as a result, to increase overall labour input, particularly
hired labour. In total, the investments financed by the project are likely
to create about 10,000 new jobs for hired labour under the different compo-
nents and also will increase the productivity of about 8,000 existing rural
workers.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTIORITY
49.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Central Bank
of the Philippines, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic
of the Philippines and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided
under Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the
text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distri-
buted to the Executive Directors separately. The special features referred
to in paragraphs 37, 38, 40, 41, and 42 have been embodied in Rules and Regu-
lations of the Central Bank which governs the operation of the project and
which may not be amended wqithout the agreement of the Bank. Those in para-
graphs 39, 40, and 44 are reflected in Sections 3.03 and 3.04 of the Loan
Agreement and Section 3.02 of the Guarantee Agreement.
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
51.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   Projects in Execution -
Ln. No. 607-PH      Second Rural Credit; US$12.5 million Loan of
June 4. 1969; Closing Date: June 30. 1974
The slow progress of the project at the beginning was mainly
due to the steep rise in the prices of farm machinery after the peso was
allowed to float in February 1970. The subsequent increases in prices of
farm produce together with decentralization of loan approvals, strengthen-
ing of staff and promotional efforts have helped improve the pace of
disbursement. This has particularly quickened over the last nine months.
The Closing Date, originally March 31, 1973,, has been postponed to
June 30, 1974. As of March 25, 1974, a balance of only $42,450 remained
uncommitted.
Ln. No. 637-PH      Irrigation; US$34.0 million Loan of August 18, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30. 1976
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines
and will supply water year-round to nearly 77,000 hectares. The project's
on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future irrigation
development in the country. Some delays were caused by the 1972 floods
but construction of the dam is now progressing ahead of schedule. All
work is expected to be completed and the loan fully disbursed by June 30,
1976, the original completion date. Project costs have increased 34 percent
over appraisal estimates largely due to inflation, devaluation of the peso
and design changes in the dam. However, as a result of close coordination
established between irrigation and agricultural supporting services, the
project is expected to reach full development in 7 years after completion
of construction instead of 13 years as appraised. The project remalns
economically viable.
Ln. No. 720-PH      Rice Processing and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4. 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This project provides long-term credit through the Developrent Bank
of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and modernization
of the private sector of the rice processing industry. It included six large
integrated processing plants to produce the high quality rice required for
the anticipated exportable surplus, which did not materialize owing to set-
backs in rice production. The President's memorandum to the Executive
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page X of 6 pages
Directors dated June 8, 1972 (R72-40) proposed amendments to the loan
agreement to shift the emphasis to rehabilitation of existing facilities
and to streamline procurement procedures.    In spite of this the project
has made very little progress and by the end of February 197h, only
US$0.5 million had been disbursed.    During the critical shortage of rice
last year the Government successfully encouraged an increase in maize
production, and the c nsumption of maize mixed with rice.    This has led to
a demand for maize processing, storage and handling facilities, and
Government has proposed the project be expanded to include grains other
than rice.   Much of the new demand will come from public entities and
small individuals, so that Government has proposed they also be included,
and that the minimum size of sub-loan be reduced to cover the smaller
processors.   These amendments, designed to widen the project's objectives,
to cover the changed conditions and to facilitate speedy and full
implementation, were presented to the Executive Directors in the President's
Memorandum dated April 15, 1974 (Sec M74-244).    The Executive Directors
approved the proposals and the Loan Agreement has been amended accordingly.
Ln No 731-PH    Highway;  US $8.0 million Loan of April 1h, 1971;
Closing Date: May 15, .975
The project for the construction and improvement of the Cotabato-
Digos road (160 km) in Mindanao is in general progressing satisfactorily.
Work was suspended in March 1973 because of civil disturbances in the
Cotabato area, but the contractor has since resumed work from the Digos
end which is outside the area affected by the fighting.    The project also
includes two components financed by UNDP: technical assistance to the
Bureau of Public Highways (BPH) for operational improvements and feasibility
studies for future highway projects.   Work on the technical assistance
component is progressing well and the feasibility studies have been
completed.
Ln No 809-PH and   Fifth Power;   US $22.0 million and US $10.0 million loan
Cr No 296-PH       and Credit of April 3, 1972; Closing date:    June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150-Md at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon.    The project is behind schedule because
procurement has taken longer than expected.    The Closing Date has been
postponed to June 30, 1978 to allow tirne for delayed procurement and because
retention monies will not be paid to the major equipment supplier until
at least one year after the plant is commissioned.    A tariff increase was
imposed in January 1973 because of rapid domestic inflation.    The situation
has also been improved by the imposition in July 1973 of a surcharge to
cover increased fuel costs.   A further tariff increase has been approved,
effective July 1, 1974 and this should enable NPC eo achieve its covenanted
rate of return in FY 7h/75.

Closing Date:   December 31, 1978
The project is assisting Government in carrying out its livestock
development program through credit supervised by the Development Bank of
the Philippines.   The project is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No 349-PH Second Education; US $12.7 million; Credit of
January 5, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project will assist Government to improve such areas as education,
planning, management and curriculum development, science teacher training,
and training of technicians, skilled craftsmen and farmers.   Although
no disbursements have been made, the project is progressing on schedule.
Ln No 891-PH   Fisheries;  US $11.6 million Loan of May 21, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This project is designed to provide long term credit to the private
sector through the Development Bank of the Philippines for marine and
inland fisheries development.   The loan became effective on December 5,
1973.   The demand for loans appears adequate and the organization to
implement them has been properly established.   The project is progressing
satisfactorily.
Ln No 939-PH   Second Ports;  US $6.1 million Loan of October 24,1973;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1977
This project provides for the rehabilitation and expansion of the
ports of General Santos and Cagayan de Oro in the island of Min anao. The
loan became effective on December 19, 1973.   The project is progressing
satisfactorily.
Ln No 950-1'H Second Highway; US $68.0 million Loan of December 12, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project is helping the Govermnent to implement its program of
construction, improvement and rehabilitation of its highways and feeder
roads.   The loan became effective on December 27, 1973.   The signing of
the Projec+ Documents for the UNDP financed Road Feasbility Studies
(Phase II), included in this project was completed on March 22, 1974 by the
Government, UNDP, and the Bank as Executing Agency.   The project is
progressing satisfactorily.
