PHILIPPINES
APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD RURAL CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Central Bank of the Philippines has requested an IBRD loan
to help finance the continuation of the IBRD-financed Second Rural Credit
Project (Loan 607-PH, US$12.5 million, 1969), which followed the First Rural
Credit Project (Loan 432-PH, US$5.0 million, 1965). The project is part of
a lending program to augment the lending capacity of participating banks for
medium and long-term loans for approved agricultural and fisheries development
projects.
ii.       As of October 31, 1973, total credit extended under the second
project, through 228 participating rural banks, was 0 112.0 million, of
{which IBRD contributed ) 62.6 million (US$9.2 million). As of April 16, 1974,
C US$11.6 million of the IBRD loan had been disbursed and the balance (US$0.9
million) is expected to be fully disbursed by the closing date (June 30, 1974).
,'The bulk of the funds was used for agricultural machinery and equipment,
principally four-wheel and two-wheel tractors. Investments for mechanization,
combined with irrigation, high yielding varieties, fertilizer and insecticides,
have helped farmers to improve their incomes and to increase production of
rice and sugarcane.
iii.      This third project would again be a three year lending operation
administered by the Central Bank of the Philippines through participating
banks, which would include about 250 rural banks and, as a new lending channel,
about 20 stock savings and loan associations. It would provide medium and
long-term credit to approximately 8,000 farmers and fisherman for investments
in:
-    farm mechanization;
-    on-farm transportation;
-    farm equipment, irrigation and other
supporting facilities;
-    coastal and inland fisheries development;
-    small scale livestock development; and
-    cottage agro-industries development (woodcraft and
fishmeal).
iv.       The principal feature would be, as under the on-going second
project, farm mechanization which, by facilitating increases in cropping
intensity, crop yield and the area under cultivation, would help the country
to achieve its major agricultural policy goal of expanding production. As
the potential for increasing employment in agriculture, which has been static
for some years, depends largely on extension of activities to lands not
presently in use, the mechanization would fulfill one of the necessary con-
ditions for the government objective of enhancing agricultural employment.
The project would create about 10,000 new jobs, and enhance the productivity
of about 8,000 additional rural workers.



- ii -
v.        The principal beneficiaries would be about 8,000 small and average
size farmers in the Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao regions, while over 90,000
small farm households would profit from hiring project tractors. The other
categories of investment, such as small scale livestock, coastal fishing and
cottage agro-industries for woodcraft and fishmeal, are designed to reach
small farmers and to provide productive employment opportunities for the
rural poor.
vi.       The incremental annual production expected from the project includes
about 150,000 tons of rice, 6,000 tons of corn, and 95,000 tons of sugar with
an estimated total value of about US$60 million.
vii.      The estimated cost of the project is US$44 million.  The proposed
financing is 50% by IBRD (to cover the estimated foreign exchange costs),
30% by the Central Bank of Philippines (with part provided by the Govern-
ment), 10% on average by participating banks, and 10% by the beneficiaries.
viii.     The Central Bank would lend its funds and on-lend IBRD funds
(other than a small amount required for a study to evaluate the economic
and financial impact of the project) to qualified rural banks and savings
and loan associations at a blended annual interest of 7%, on amortization
terms similar to those of the beneficiaries.  Loan terms to farmers would
range from four to ten years, including a grace period if required, at an
annual 12% interest rate. Surplus funds derived from the amortization of
Central Bank loans to participating banks, and not required for repayment
to IBRD, would be relent for further agricultural development under similar
terms and procedures.
ix.       Since the second rural credit loan was almost fully committed for
sub-projects by the end of March 1974, eligible sub-loans made after April 1,
1974 would qualify for retroactive financing from the third loan in order to
avoid holding up lending operations at a time when the regular planting
season is approaching. This retroactive financing would not exceed $500,000
and would be provided only for sub-loans which are eligible under the conditions
of both the second and third rural credit projects.
x.        This third rural credit project is suitable for an IBRD loan of
US$22 million to the Central Bank of the Philippines, to be guaranteed by
the Republic of the Philippines, for a term of 14 years including a grace
period of four years.



PHILIPPINES
APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD RURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Central Bank of the Philippines (CB) has applied for a third
IBRD loan to provide medium aiid long-term funds for agricultural development.
IBRD made the first loan (432-PH) of US$5 million in 1965, and the second
(607-PH) of US$12.5 million in 1969. US$11.6 million of the second loan had
been disbursed as of April 16, 1974, and the balance (US$0.9 million)
should be fully disbursed by the closing date (June 30, 1974).
1.02      The project is a continuation of the on-going Second Rural Credit
Project (Loan 607-PH) but with some diversification to benefit small farmers
and fishermen. Current loan approval procedures have discouraged small sub-
loans, so that simplified procedures and relaxed conditions would be introduced
for sub-loans below P 10,000 (US$1,475).
1.03      Since the second rural credit loan was almost fully committed for
sub-projects by the end of March 1974, eligible sub-loans made after April 1,
1974 would qualify for retroactive financing from the third loan in order to
avoid holding up lending operations at a time when the regular planting season
is approaching. This retroactive financing would not exceed $500,000 and would
be provided only for sub-loans which are eligible under the conditions of
both the second and third rural credit projects.
1.04      This appraisal report is based on the findings of a mission composed
of Messrs. D. Lee, C. Downing, G. von Wallenberg, Miss J. Mitra (Bank) and
R. Ferraris (Consultant) that visited the Philippines in November/December,
1973.
II. BACKGROUND
General
2.01      The Republic of the Philippines covers an area of about 298,000
km2 scattered over more than 7,000 islands between the Pacific Ocean and
the China Sea. 98% of the area covers the 45 largest islands. The popula-
tion is currently estimated at around 39 million, growing at 3% annually.
Real GNP grew at 5 to 6% per year during the last decade. Per capita GNP
in 1971 was about US$240 1/.

The jgnr__ictural Seetor
2.03      A,griculture accounts for about one-third of net ecne3tlc product,
one-hal f of total employment and 70% of conmodity export earrings.  In the
early 1960s the rate of growth of agricultural output was slow and failed
to keep up with population increases.  Irn the late 1960s, largely as a
result of the adoption of improved rice varieties, it accelerated sharply
(8.0% average between 1966 and 1970) and even surpassed the substantial rate
of growth recorded in the non-agricultural sector. Employment in agriculture,
on the other hand, increased during the early period of low growth and Levelled
off during the later years. With a rapid growth rate in agriculture and little
change in employment, productivity per worker in agriculture increased sharply
i.n 1965-70, largely from increases in rice. Most of the increase il' the labor
force between 1965 and 1970 was in non-agricultural employment, and the un-
employment rate in rural areas has remained high.
2.04      The gap in incomes between workers in agriculture and in other
sectors has narrowed appreciably, although agricultural incomes are still
substancially lower. Farmers using improved technology, such as the new
rice varieties, have shared in the higher incomes, but those continuing
in traditional ways have been largely unaffected. 1/
2.05      There is considerable pressure of p2ople on land in the Philippines,
where the population density is 131 people/km  compared with the Asian
average of 86. Lowland areas best suited for rice have been fully occupied
for over a decade. Migration is hneavy from the overcrowded regions of
Central Luzon and the Visayas to the Cagayan Valley in Northeast Luzon
and NI'ndanao in the south.
2.06      The performance of the agricultural sector will be crucial in
determining whether the drive towards a more rapid but more equitable
income expansion succeeds. The sector's major goals are self-sufficiency
in cereals, particularly rice and corn; expansion of agricultural exports;
intensification of agrarian reform; better conservation of natural resources;
and strengthening of instituticnal s'%noort- Self-sufficiency in cereals
is important not only to strengthen the balance of payments, but also to
raise incomes among the rura'l pon-llation.

-3-
Agricultural Credit
2.07      Agricultural credit is available from both government and non-
government institutions. Apart from CB, which only refinances, the principal
government institutions directly involved are the Philippine National Bank
(PNB), the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and the Agricultural
Credit Administration (ACA). The Land Bank is being revitalized and is
expected to play an important role in financing land transfer and develop-
ment under the Agrarian Reform Program. In the private sector there are
622 rural banks, 40 commercial banks, 32 development banks, and 35 stock
savings and loan associations (local private banks). These provide most
of the non-government institutional credit.
2.08      Government institutions provide about 20% of all institutional
credit. In 1972, PNB advanced 27.7% of its total lending for agriculture,
fisheries and forestry, DBP 56.5%, rural banks 90.2%, ACA 100%, the private
commercial banks 6.4%, and stock savings and loan associations 7.5%. Total
agricultural loans made by these institutions in 1972 was nearly ) 3.5 bil-
lion (US$516 million), or 10.2% of their total lending of F 34.0 billion
(US$5.0 billion).
2.09      Government Sector. PNB is the largest bank, with total resources
of I 6.2 billion (US$915 million) and 160 branches and offices. Its agri-
cultural financing has been mainly to commercial farms and plantations, mostly
for seasonal production inputs, marketing and processing. DBP provides medium
and long term credit for a wJide range of agricultural enterprises. Its total
lending has slowed down, but agricultural credit has expanded rapidly. It
currently administers three IBRD financed projects: (a) Rice Processing and
Storage (Loan 720-PH, US$14.3 million); (b) Fisheries Credit (Loan 891-PH,
US$11.6 million); and (c) Livestock (Loan 823-PH, US$7.5 million). ACA
finances production and marketing cooperatives and small farmers, but owing
to lack of financial resources its lending has greatly decreased, and its
future is uncertain.
2.10      Private Sector.  Among the private institutions, which together
account for 80% of agricultural lending, commercial banks are the most
important. In 1972 they provided 57% of all agricultural credit, followed
by rural banks with 20% (details for 1971 and 1972 in Annex 3, Table 2).
Commercial banks' loans are short term, mostly for marketing and not production.
Rural banks' credit, however, is almost exclusively for seasonal production
credit, and medium and long term development loans for smaller operators
(Annex 5). Private development banks lend the larger part of their resources
for agricultural development (587 in 1972), mainly for farm mechanization
and processing facilities, but their share of total agricultural financing
is only about 2%Z.
2.11      Non-banking organizatiors, including fertilizer dealers, farm
machinery suppliers, marketing and processing firms, shopkeepers, landlords
and private moneylenders, stiil provide substantial credit. The cooperative
movement, -which has been assigned a vital role in implementing the Agrarian
Reform Program, is exDected to accumulate substantial funds, particularly
in agrarian reform areas, to replace credit from former landlords.



-4-
2.12      Interest Rates.  Prevailing annual interest rates from insti-
tutional sources are 12-14% (Annex 5). For loans fully secured by real
estate or for medium and long tern purposes, the rate is normally 12%.  For
loans secured by chattel mortgages and for unsecured short term advances
the rate is generally 14%. Government bonds yield 8-10% and investments
on the money market 10-12%. The effective cost: of credit from agricultural
input suppliers is 15-20% annually and from private lenders is much higher.
A small farmer might borrow five sacks of rice in kind for seed or for
food and repay six sacks after harvest in 3-4 months times, the equivalent
of 60-80% per annum. However, with the increasing availability of credit
from institutional sources, particularly when coupled with technical
services, farmers have used less non-institutional credit, while interest
rates from such sources appear to have declined.
III. THE FIRST AND SECOND RURAL CREDIT PROJECTS
3.01      The first IBRD Loan (432-PH) of US$5 million helped to meet
the increasing requirement for medium and long term credit for agricultural
development between 1965 and 1969. Loan funds were channeled through 148
rural banks to about 2,600 farmers for farm machinery, irrigation pumps,
and for livestock and fisheries, as in the following table:

of      Mlillion        % of        Loan

Total                2,594        21.4         100.0        8,250
Two-thirds of the funds were used in the Luzon region, where small farms
and higlh tenancy predominate and rice is the most important crop. The
balance was lent in about equal proportions in the Visayas and Mindanao
regions.
3.02      The second IBRD Loan (607-PH) of US$12.5 million was for
continuation of the first project. The purposes of sub-loans remained
basically the sare, buit also included storage and processing facilities
and on-farm transportation c'uipment. These Drojects have had significant
institution-building effects for rural banks   As of October 31, 1973, total
loans througl 228 rural lbanv s to 3,376 farmè.&  was V 112.0 million, of which
IBRD contributed P 62.6 million (IUSS9.2 million). The details appear in

The distribution of participating rural banks was similar to the first
project; 158 (69%) in Luzon, 43 (19%') in Visayas and 27 (12%) in
Mindanao.
3.03      Total project investment was p 133.2 million (US$19.7 million)
as of October 31, 1973. IBRD contributed 47.0%, CB/Government 27.4%,
rural banks 9.6%, and farmers 16.0%. Under the first and originally under
the second project, rural banks provided 10% of the investment cost from
their own resources.
3.04      CB's surveys indicate that project beneficiaries have received
satisfactory financial benefits attributable to: savings in cost of
production with mechanized land preparation; use of tractors for custom
(hire) work; increased cropping intensity; and extension of cultivated land.
A further study of-project impact is currently being conducted by IBRD's
Operations Evaluation Department.
3.05      The overdues position of rural banks generally, and under the
on-going second credit project, is not yet satisfactory. Details are in
Annex 5, Tables 8 and 9, and are summarized as follows:

-6-
The final fiaures for 1973 should show an improvement over those above.
For the second loan, overdues are expected to be below 55% of demand at the
end of 1973. Throughout the rural banking system, overdues for medium and
llong-term loans are generally higher than for seasonal loans. Very few banks
have rescheduled loans, even in justifiable cases such as losses due to
natural disasters in "calamity areas", although CB permits this.
3.06      inder the on-going second project IBRD required that rural barnks
whose overlues were more than 25% of total loan portfolio be debarred from
the project. Most banks were included, since the average over the past
five years has been under 207% (maximum. 20.4% in 1972). The ratio of project
overdues to project loan portfolio was as follows:
1971     1972      1973 /a
Loan portfolio          t million         15.2      52.5     80.0

Overdues/Portfolio         %               3.9       4.8      5e65
/a   As of September 30, 1973.
In the past, no adequate breakdown of overdues by length of time overdue has
been made, so that no estimate of likely bad debts can be made at this stage.
Overall, rura'l banks' provisions for bad debts have averaged about 8% of
arrears over the past 5 years, or 1.67 of loan portfolio.
3.07      While the current position is not satisfactory, it is still manage-
able. During negotiations, a scheme was worked out whereby project overdues
would be progressively reduced over the next few years to more satisfactory
levels. To qualify as participants, the overdues of rural banks have had
to be below 25% of their loan portfolio, and most banks were able to aualify.
As the banks' portfolios have been rapidly expanding, however, this ratio is
no longer satisfactory as a m.easure of the rate of collection of loans as they
fall due.
3.08      It was agreed at negotiations that, under this project, the partici-
pating banks would be required to have arrears not exceeding 25% of demand,
)rrears being defined as "amounts due at the end of a twelve month period as
p&¢Zcentage of demand," and demand being defined as "principal and interest
falling due during the period plus overdues at the beginning of the period."
It was further agreed that one year after the introduction of this new
requirement, the qualifying ratio for participation would be reduced to 20%
of demand, and that efforts would be made to reduce it further thereafter.
3.09      Tf this new requirement, which is much stiffer than that under the
on-going project, were applied without allowing reasonable time for rural banks
to intensify their collection efforts, a very large number of participating



7-
banks would be abruptly disqualified. It has been estimated that as many as
160 out of 230 participating banks may be discuali'ied. Accordingly, it was
agreed at negotiations that this new requirement be made effective on April 1,
1975, and that the current formula for maximum arrears, defined &aS 25', of
total loan investments, be applied for the intervening period.  Before April 1,
1975, each participating bank would be required to demonstrate on the basis
of its accounts for the previous calendar year or of its subsequent monthly
financial report that its arrears were 25% or less of de-nand. 1f it
failed to demonstrate this, the bank would be disqualified until it twas able
to show that it had reduced the arrears to the required level or bely. The
applicable maximum rate of arrears would be reduced to 20Z of demand effective
April 1, 1976.
3.10      During the past months, collections have been steadily improving,
and, once the announcement is made that the new formula would be effective
beginning April 1, 1975, the participating banks are expected to intensify
their collection efforts, especially during the months when the farmers would
be marketing their crops following the peak rice harvest in November and
December.
3.11      Since the arrears on accounts other than IBRD-financed loans are
small, and their proportion in portfolio is expected to become smaller, it
was agreed at negotiations that the new requirement be related only to IBRD-
financed loans. These conditions have been incorporated in the draft Rules
and Regulations under which CB would operate this line of credit. Under the
terms of the loan agreement these Rules and Regulations must be satisfactory
to the Bank and may not be altered without Bank's agreement.
IV. RURAL BANKING INSTITUTIONS
General
4.01      Although commercial banks provide the bulk of agricultural credit,
the rural banking system (of 622 individual banks) (Annex 5) is better
established in rural areas and capable of reaching a larger number of
average and small farmers. Rural banks have proven successful in providing
medium and long term loans for agricultural development through the first
two loans, and would be, therefore, the principal group through which
sub-loans under this project would be channeled. In addition, there are
35 stock savings and loan associations (including about 15 operating in the
greater Manila area) which have, in the past, lent primarily for commercial
and housing purposes. They are able to supplement the rural banking system
and extend their coverage to rural areas, and the Government has asked that
they be included in this project. They are supervised by the same department
in the Central Bank, and in many cases they are owned by the same group
of investors. They therefore would provide satisfactory additional lending
channels for this project.



-8-
Rural Banks
4.02      Organization.  Rural banks now effectively provide rural areas
with banking facilities. They are private banks authorized by CB's Monetary
Board, and Government currently holds 40% of their stock, with private
individuals holding the balance.  CB's Department of Rural Banks and
Savings and Loan Associations (DRBSLA) (Annex 4) provides: refinancing
facilities; technical assistance, and training of management and staff; and
also supervises and examines their operations. A unique aspect of the rural
banking system has been the mobilization of local personnel of different
backgrounds, who after varied periods of training and supervision, have been
transformed into satisfactory bankers. 606 banks are currently operating
(14 are in liquidation and 2 under reorganization), while the Four-year
Development Program for the rural banking system (1974-77) exnects a further
100 to be established each year for the plan period.
4.03      Financial Resources.  As of September 30, 1973, rural banks'
total resources were f 1,291 million (US$190 million); V 216 million (US$32
million) in paid-up capital; F 99 million (US$15 million) in surpluses,
reserves and undistributed profits; f 413 million (US$61 million) in deposits;
and 1 563 million (US$83 million) in borrowings from CB. Their own resources
have increased by about 127 annually over the last five years. Total
liabilities increased from r 694.4 million (US$102.4 million) by r 281.9
million (US$41.6 million) or 41% during the first nine months in 1973. This
w\as primarily due to the introduction of the "Massagana 99" rice production
program and increased disbursements under the second IBRD project.  Most
rural banks are established, capitalized and managed by close family groups,
although cooperatives may now own shares in them.
4.04      Authorized rural banks accept savings, time and demand deposits
at a maximum annual interest rate of 6%o for savings and 8% for other deposits.
Although non-institutional rates are much higher than these, rural banks had
V 413 million in deposits (90% savings) at September 30, 1973, an increase
of one quarter over December 31, 1972.
4.05      CB rediscounts promissory notes up to P0% under ordinary schemes,
and 100,' under supervised production schemes (rice, corn and sugar) at 3% a
year, up to a limit of 300% of the borrowing bank's net worth plus 50% of
its I.nthly average savings deposits over the preceding four months. The
etn.-is are up to 270 days for agricultural and industrial loans, 180 days for
commercial papers , and 360 days for loans to cooperatives. Rural banks with
arrears of mor' :,-an 25% of portfolio are excluded from rediscounting (Annex
5, para 15). For sDecial programs (including the two IBRD projects) CB
advances funds as special time deposits secured by promissory notes.
4.06      Lending Operations.  Loans made by rural banks have increased from
8 434 million in 196? to 1 752 imillion in 1972. The average loan size was
F 3,400 in 1953; ? 14,900 in 1972. Of the 528,000 loans in 1972, almost 97%
(74%y by value) were of V 5,, O00 or less. About two-thirds were secured by



- 9 -
real estate mortgages and one-fourth by chattel mortgages and other sureties,
while most of the rest were unsecured. In the same year, only about 6% of
the.total were medium and long-term.
4.07      Arrears.  The problems of arrears have been discussed in paras 3.07-
3.11 together with proposals for improvements over the next few years.
4.08      Profits.  Rural banks' income and expenditure has increased sub-
stantially over the last five years, while net income and the return on capital
have declined. Higher profitability could be achieved by increasing the
volume of lending, and could be handled by most of the banks with marginal
cost increases. This project would substantially augment rural banks' loan
portfolios, make rural banking financially more attractive to stockholders
and potential investors, and strengthen the system as a whole, thus promoting
lending to rural areas.
Stock Savings and Loan Associations
4.09      Background and Organization.  As of October 31, 1973, there were
35 Stock Savings and Loan Associations (SSLA) (compared with 77 non-stock
associations), including 14 in the greater Manila area; 7 with branches (Map).
SSLA are registered as stock corporations after approval by CB and the
Securities and Exchange Commissioners. They may open branches (rural banks are
not allowed by law to do so). They can accept deposits from the public and
make loans to them, and are now classified as banking institutions.   Unlike
rural banks they cannot: (a) enjoy exemition from taxes, Government fees and
charges; and (b) receive Government capital assistance.
4.10      Financial Resources.  At September 30, 1973, the total paid-up
capital of all SSLA was 0 33.4 million (257 of total resources) and surpluses,
reserves and undivided profits f 0.9 million (0.6% of resources) (Annex 6,
Table 1). Their main strength is their ability to collect funds from stock-
holders and the public as savings and time deposits. Savings have increased
to 56% of total resources at the above date, and time deposits 12%.  Each
SSLA must maintain a 6%o reserve in liquid funds against its savings and time
deposits, and insure deposits with the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation.
The system also has its own Liquidity Guarantee Fund, which greatly assisted
SSLAs during the heavy withdrawals entailed by the floods in July/August,
1972, and the run on deposits following the declaration of martial law in
September, 1972.  Under the lauw, SSLAs may borrow from CB or, subject to the
Monetary Board's approval, rediscount notes and bills of exchange or other
commercial papers at the same interest rates charged to rural banks.
4.11      Lending Operations.  Commercial and housing loans are currently
70% of SSLAs' total loan portfolio, and agricultural loans about 8%.  SSLA's
provide mainly short term loans of up to one year, but by law can make loans
of up to 3 years (up to 20 years for loans secured by unencumbered real
estate). They may charge up to 127 a year on loans secured by titled real
estate, and up to 14% on loans otlherwise secured or without security.
Actual rates vary from 9 to 14∞'. Only about one-third of loans are secured
by real estate mortgages.



- 10-
4.12      Collections and Profits.  Collections to date are satisfactory.
Net income of all SSLAs showed a net loss of t 23,000 in 1969, but improved
to a profit of V 1.7 million in 1972. Although profitability is currently
only modest (5% of the paid-up capital), all indicators show an upward trend.
V. THE PROJECT
5.01      The Project would be a continuation and expansion of the program
financed under the on-going Second Rural Credit Project (Loan 607-PH,
US$12.5 million) for a further 3 years. It would provide medium and long-
term credit through qualified rural banks and SSLAs to about 8,000 farmers
and rural entrepreneurs for investment in: (a) farm mechanization; (b) on-
farm transportation; (c) farm support facilities and equipment; (d) coastal
and inland fisheries; (e) small-scale livestock development; and (f) cottage
scale agro-industries. The last of these would be additional to the cate-
gories financed under the on-going project. The project would also include
finance for a study to assess its financial and economic impact.
Detailed Features
5.02      (i) Farm Mechanization.  This category would include about 1,800
imported four-wheel tractors of up to 80 BHP with accessories and implements,
and 1,000 domestically manufactured power tillers. This mechanization would
contribute to expanded production by facilitating increases in yield and
intensification and extensification of farming. It would be mainly in sugar-
cane and irrigated rice farming areas, and on some upland corn farms. It
would help sugarcane farmers to increase their yield, rice farmers to increase
their cropping intensity, and corn farmers to extend their land under cultiva-
tion. Benefits would accrue not only to owner/operators but also to small
A farmers using their services. The net employment effect would be some increase
"( in employment of hired labor (Annex 8). In the rice sector, mechanical land
preparation is expected to increase cropping intensity, and, as a result, to
increase overall labor input, hired labor in particular. Tractors of over
80 BlIl' would be excluded because their performance under local conditions is
not expected to be better than smaller tractors costing much less.
5.03      (ii) On-farm Transportation.  This category would include about
250 new and 200 imported reconditioned trucks to alleviate the existing
shortage of farm transport. It would help increase the recovery of rice
and sugar from paddy and sugarcane by reducing the waiting time before
milling, and improve farmers' bargaining position vis-a-vis middlemen. No
reconiditioned trucks without warranties comparable to those of new trucks
would be financed (Annex 9).
5.04      (iii) Farm Support Facilities and Equipmer.  This category would
include 250 farm machinery repair shops and purchase of minor farm equipment
sucti as sprayer/lusters, tractor and power tiller implements and attachments,



- 1, -
grain driers, and t'hareshers cf up to 13 tons per day, ard the construction
and equipping of small scale private irrigation facilities and on-fartm storages
(Annex 10).  Threshers of 13 tons or more would be excluded because they would
cause significant displacement of hired labor, while there are no data avail-
able to show that there would be comnensating gains to offset the negative
employment effect.
5.05      (iv) Coastal and Inland Fisheries.  Fisherv development woul-d cover
the construction of inland fishponds and fishpens, and purchase of abouc. 300
small coastal fishing boats and equipment. Boats would be bought by local
entrenreneurs, and crewed by local fishermen, who would share the catehes.
The maximum size of boat financed would be increased from the 4 rozs net
under the on-going project to 20 tons gross, to increase the eF-ective fishing
range.  This sub-project would have no material conflict with t.e IBRD
Fislieries Credit Project (Loarn 891-PH, US$11.6 million) currently administered
by DBP, in which much larger boats (of 70 tons gross and above) and larger
fishponds are financed.
5.06      (v) Small Scale Livestock Development.  Small-scale poultry, swine
and dairy farm development would include the construction of pens and sheds,
and purchase of initial stocks. There would be no conflict with the IBRD
Livestock Project (Loan 823-PH, US$7.5 million) presentlv administered by
DBP under which the minimum sub-loan at present is V 10,000 (USS1,475),
because this livestock development would be on a smaller scale (Annex 12).
5.07      (vi) Cottage Agro-Industries.  This category would include a limited
number of cottage agro-industries for production of fishmeal for import sub-
stitution, and labor-intensive woodcraft products for export. It would help
to induce the rural banks to diversify their lending operations into cottage
industries, which are not emphasized under the on-going project (Annex 13).
5.08      (vii) Evaluation Study.  The project would include finance for a
study to be undertaken by a group of qualified local experts, under terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank, to review the progress and assess the
economic and financial impact of th,' first, second and this project.  The
study would help review project implementation and provide useful. data for
preparation of similar projects in future (draft Terms of Reference are in
Annex 14). This is included because of the need to maintain project review
designed to assure effective use of the loan proceeds. CB would provi:de much
the data required.
5.09      The following table gives the estimated scope and blend of the
project by major investment items (details in Annex 15):

Total                                 297.2
Project Area
5.10      The project would be in the Luzon, Visayas and IMindanao regions
(see 1ilap). The Luzon region is principally Luzon Island (the largest and
most important island) (110,000 km ).  It is also the oldest inland settle-
ment, is highest in population density and tenancy, and is the country's
rice bowl.  Trade, industry, communications, business and finance revolve
around M'anila.  Tle Visayas region includes principally the islands of Panay,
Negros and Leyte characterized by a diversified agriculture:  rice, sugarcane,
corn and other crops. Land tenure is mixed but average farming operations
are larger than in Luzon. Iloilo on Panay, Bacolod on Negros, and Tacloban
on Leyte are the principal trade and business centers. The uindanao region
covers 2Mindanao Island, the second largest island (96,000 km ).  Its growth
and development have been rapid since World War II, having large areas of
unused land and forests, and deposits of valuable minerals. It now leads
in coconut production, although agriculture is quite diversified, and rice,
corn, ramie, abaca, pineapple and livestock are important products. Mindanao
enjoys a favorable climate, is free of typhoons, and land tenancy is low.
The provincial capitals of Davao and Cotabato are the principal trade and
business centers.
5.11      About 250 rural banks  7 1_ be eligible to participate in the
project.  Their distribution would be similar to that under the second
project:  160 in Luzon and 40-50 each in Visayas and Mindanao.  In addition,
about 20 out of the 35 SSLAs would be eligible to participate, although
those 15 operating exclusively in greater Manila would not.

following table. They are based on experience in the second loan and
estimates from similar development by gorernmental and private sources. 1973
(December) prices are used as the base and price contingencies (about 19%
of the project cost at best estimates over the three-year period) are
included. The estimated foreign exchange component is about US$22 million
(50%). Details by investment category are in Annex 15.

The IBRD loan would be channeled through CB. The contribution from Govern-
rment and CB would come partly from surplus funds derived from the first and
second loan and partly from Government funds. Recently established rural
banks with limited resources would be permitted to contribute less than 10%
but not less than 5%.  The benef4ciaries' 10% would be a minimum consistent
with the objective of reaching small farmers. Some farmers, especially the
larger, may be able to contribute more, and banks would seek a larger
contribution whenever possible. Each participating bank would enter into
an agreement with CB covering the terms and conditions under which it would
obtain IBRD and CB funds.
Disbursements
5.14      IBRD disbursements would be made to CB against 56% of loans to
beneficiaries (maximum of 50% of investment cost) as disbursed by rural banks
and SSLA upon submission of documentation by CB supported by statement of
expenditure. In addition, IBRD would disburse 100% of the cost of the
'  Evaluation Study (para 5.08).  Documentation of disbursements certified by
CB Loan Officers would be retained on file at CB, or a designated local
depository. Full disbursement of the IBRD loan would take about three years
(Annex 17).
Procurement
5.15      As in the second project, machinery and equipment, including trucks
and irrigation equipment, and enginEs and equipment for fishing boats would
be purchased locally from firms representing major international manufacturers,
who maintain branches and dealers throughout the Philippines.  Competition is
keen, and services and repair facilities are satisfactory. The firms submit
their selling prices regularly to DPBSLA, which advises participating lending
institutions and farmers on prices and mark-ups. Farmers would choose the
firm they prefer for their purchases.
5.16      Sufficient private contractors are available for construction of
farm buildings and boats. Building materials, including lumber and cement,
are produced locallv. Farmers and fishermen would choose their contractor
for construction and for equipment supply. The size of individual contracts
would be too small for international competitive bidding to be practicable.
Sub-projects would be widely dispersed in different regions and spread over
time so that bulking would not be workable.
Organization and Management
5.17      The Central Bank of the Philippines would administer the project,
as in the previous two.  Its Department of Rural Banks and Savings and Loan
Associations (DRBSLA) would channel funds to the rural banks and SSLAs.
DRBSLA's Special Financing Group II would be in charge of the project. Its
Special Agricultural Projects Division, assisted by Loan Teams and technicians
in the field, would process and sanction loan applications. The Accounting



- 15 -
Division would release funds to participating institutions, handle counterpart
funds, claim reimbursements from IBRD, and prepare t'.e required reports.
Other Groups and Divisions of DRBSLA would supervise and audit the operatons
of rural banks and SSLAs, and provide the necessary supporting services.
DRBSLA is competently managed by a Director and an Associate Director with
long service in CB and substantial experience with rural banks and SSLAs.
ie is assisted by capable senior officers and a staff of about 500. Further
details on DRBSLA and its operations are in Annex 4.
5.18      Five Loan Teams in the field sanction loans without reference to
headquarters. One headquarters team covers the areas not serviced by the
field teams. CB has 62 agricultural and 12 fisheries technicians in the
field. 10 of the fisheries technicians are seconded from the Fisheries
Commission. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that they would remain
with CB until project disbursements were completed, as otherwzise CB could not
process project fisheries loans.
5.19      Decentralization (introduced for the second project) has speeded
tip loan processing, but has tended to isolate field staff from technical
information. DRBLSA has to date largely concentrated on loan processing,
but there is now a need for greater project coordination, more technical
guidance and direction to field staff, and project monitoring and evaluation
at field level. A Technical Support and Evaluation Unit would be established
as a Division of the Special Financing Group of DPBLSA.  It would be headed
by an agricultural economist, assisted by three agriculturalists (one each
being a crop, a livestock and an agricultural engineering specialist), and
supported by statistical and secretarial staff. It would: (a) maintain
liaison with agencies and research institutions concerned with agricultural
and fisheries development; (b) collect information on project development;
(c) disseminate project information, technical guidance and direction to
management and field staff; and (d) monitor project operations and evaluate
the results at farm level. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that this
Unit would be set up and fully staffed within six months of project effectiveness.
5.20      Although loan processing has been speeded up, it is still relatively
long, mainly because of the time taken to inspect land for collateral, to
register mortgages and to obtain tax assessments. Also field staff have to
schedule their visits and routes economically, and may not always be able to
attend to distant applicants without delay. The large average size of loans
under the ongoing project (P 33,200) compared with the first (Y 8,250) may be
partly due to these lengthy procedures. To encourage small loans by speeding
up processing, the following simplified procedures would be introduced for
loans of t 10,000 and less, firstly bv rural banks that had participated in
the on-going projects, and later as experience was gained by the other
institutions:
(a) authorize privately-hired production technicians employed
by participating lending institutions currently working on
seasonal supervised credit schemes to prepare farm and



- 16 -
home plans and feasibility studies after having
successfully completed appronriate training with CB
(at present there are 290 such technicians, graduate
agriculturists without exception, employed by 259
rural banks), so that CB technicians could concentrate
on larger loans;
(b)  encourage participating financing institutions to
accept chattel mortgages, or (where aDnropriate)
sureties and Government guarantees, as collateral
instead of land; and
(c)  reduce the paperwork required for documentation.
All loan applications would continue to be subject to final approval by Loan
Officers and CB's Loan Teams would make random post audits. An estinmated 20%
of loans could be processed by this method. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that these procedures would be introduced on a trial basis
irm.ediately after effectiveness.
Audi t ing
5.21      Auditing procedures are satisfactory.  As required by law, DBRST.A
audits each rural bank and SSLA every year. In addition, these institutions
submit annual balance sheets and statements of income and expenditure to CB,
which makes special examinations as reouired to monitor those with operational
difficulties or management problems. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that each participating bank would be auiited at least once each year in manners
acceptable to CB, and the records of such audit would be retained on file at
CB.
Lending Policies, Terms and Criteria
5.22      CB would establish minimum standards for rural banks and SSLAs
to qualify for participation. The criteria would include:
(a)  character, comoetence and integrity of officers;
"n,  nast performance as to soundness of investments and
compliance with the law, regulations and generally
accepted banking practice;
(c)  soundness of financial position, based on liquidity,
:ldequacy of equity, and profitability;
(d)  in operation for at least one year;
(e)  rediscounting facilities with CB not withdrawn within
the past year; and



- 17 -
(f) maximum arrears requirement:
(i) effective till March 31, 1975, arrears not exceeding
25% of total loan portfolio;
(ii)  effective April 1, 1975, arrears not exceeding 25%
of demand, arrears being defined as "amounts due at
the end of a twelve month period as a percentage of demand,"
and demand defined as " principal and interest falling
due during the period plus overdues at the beginning
of the period"; and
(iii) effective April 1, 1976, arrears, as defined above (ii),
not exceeding 20% of demand.
5.23      The IBRD loan would be, as for the second loan, for 14 years, includ-
ing 4 years grace. Terms of loan to the ultimate beneficiary would range
from three to ten years, the average being about 7 years, including a grace
period when required (Annex 5, para 29). IBRD's lending rate would be 7-1/4%
annually against 6-1/2% for the second loan. The lending rate to the ultimate
beneficiary at 12% would be in line witi the general interest structure (para
2.12) and the same as other IBRD-financed agricultural projects (para 2.09).
The participating institutions would be charged a blended rate of not less
than 7%, and thus retain a margin of 5%. This spread is reasonable, given the
high administrative cost of dealing with small loans and the need to give the
rural banks an incentive to participate. CB's interest margin would be reduced
from 1.06% to 0.59% per annum.  CB's annual income from the three projects
would be about P 2.0 million next year, and about ' 2.8 million after full
disbursement of this project, and would be sufficient to cover administrative
expenises.
5.24      These rates are based on the contributions set out in para 5.13.
CB has established criteria that each rural bank less than three years old
with its own resources (net worth) not exceeding V 500,000 (or such lower
amounts as may be determined by CB from time to time) may contribute less
than 10% but not less than 5%, provided the overall 10% average was maintained.
SSLAs would contribute not less than 10%, without exception.
5.25      CB's terms for loans to participating institutions would appro-
ximately coincide with those to the ultimate beneficiary. CB would rele2td
for similar purposes principal repayments received from rural banks not
required to amortize the first, second or this loan. CB would bear the
foreign exchange risk.
5.26      Loans would only be granted after a realistic farm development
plan and budget had been prepared with the assistance of a CB agricultural
or fisheries technician. For small loans of ' 10,000 or less, such plans
may be prepared by participating banks' technicians (para 5.20).



- 13 -
5.27      Lending institutions valuation methods for real estate mortgages
would be changed to reflect more realistic values, as estimated by the
lending institution and the CB technician, and reviewed by the Loan Team.
The amount of sub-loan would remain at less than 70%1 of the value of titled
and 50%,5 of untitled property.  Loans to land reform beneficiaries who cannot
provide collateral comparable to freehold title fully acceptable to the
iending institutions, would be guaranteed by the Agricultural Guarantee Fund
(AGFF), which has been recently amended (PD 435) to expand the coverage to
4nclude IBRD-financed sub-loans.
5.28      Currently SSLAs may borrow from CB only for emergency programs and
rediscount notes and bills of exchange and other commercial papers. They
would require Monetary Board approval to borrow for this project. The Monetary
Board has already empowered SSLAs to borrow from CB for this project, and
CB's rules have been revised to enable SSLAs to make medium and long-term
loans for agricultural development.
VI. MARKETS AND PRICES
P11ice
6.01      Since the Philippines is expected to be partly dependent on  imported
rice for the next few years, and because of the short supply forecast in the
world rice market, no major problem in marketing project production is
anticipated. Prices for paddy at farmgate have more than doubled over the
past 5 years, from about r 340 per ton in 1968 to about V 800 at the end of
1973. The present paddy price of about ? 800 per ton (government floor price)
corresponds, in terms of the milled rice equivalent, to a cif cost of IJS$170
per ton of imported Thai rice (USS150 fob Bangkok, 30%' broken, plus US$20 per
ton for freight). An average farmgate price of t 761 per ton (US$112) has
been assumed for the financial analyses (Annex 19, Tables 1 and 3), while a
value of output in milled rice equivalent of t 1,152 (US$170) per ton (at a
milling recovery of 66%) has been assumed for the economic analyses (Annex 21).
Corn
6.02      As a result of the rapid expansion of the animal feed industry,
and the expected increase in substitution of corn for rice for human con-
sumption, import of corr. is expected to continue, so that marketing the incre-
mental corn output from this project would not pose major problems. The
average price of corn has climbed steadily since 1970. The present floor
price at which the National Grains Authority stands ready to buy is 1 500
(US$74) per ton, while the market price seldom falls below Y 550 (US$81). A
farmgate price of r 440 (US$64) has been assumed for financial analyses and
an economic benefit of US880 per ton, in line with the latest price guidelines,
for economic analyses.



- 19 -
Sugar
6.03      The production and marketing of sugar is controlled under the
Sugar Limitation Law. Output has steadily increased over the years.
Although the continuation of the preferential arrangements with the USA
that have assured an export market and insulated Philippine sugar from the
effect of low world prices in the past is uncertain after 1974, the export
prospects for sugar on the world market have considerably improved. The
sugarcane price received by the farmer is assumed to be ? 1,070 (US$157)
per ton equivalent of sugar for financial analyses, and the estimated value
of sugar applied for economic analyses is US$0.08 per pound, or US$176 per
ton, in line with the latest IBRD commodity price guidelines.
Livestock
6.04      Marketing of swine and poultry products is organized by private
brokers and middlemen, who buy directly from farmers. Prices of these
products have shown a constant upward trend during the past 15 years. No
organized marketing network exists, and problems could eventually occur
with large scale production programs. However, the investments in livestock
proposed under the project are small, and the output would be intended
either for assured local markets or as raw material for processing.
Fish and Fish Products
6.05      During the past decade, fish production has more than doubled,
to about 1.0 million tons per annum. Despite rapid increases in fish
production, domestic demand has outpaced the supply, and retail prices
have risen faster than other food commodities. Demand for fish and fish
products, including fishmeal, is expected to rise very substantially in the
decade ahead. Estimated annual increases in requirements, averaging some
68,000 tons per year for the years 1975-80, are substantially above increases
in production in recent years. Domestic demand would therefore easily absorb
the estimated incremental production of about 20,000 tons (less than 2% of
the total harvest) at full development of the project.
Other Outputs
6.06      Other outputs from the project would include cottage woodcraft
products and services from trucking and farm machinery repair shops.
Incremental supplies from the project would be very small in comparison
with the very buoyant national markets for these products and services.

VII. BEYEFITS A-ND jUSTIFICATION
7.0?      Production:  The project's 61rect benefits would coame from the
increase in production resulting from t'he various investments. Farm
mectianization would help increase r.ICe production, :Ln l.ne withIn government

to increased sugarcane production to meet increasing dornestic aadS export
sugar demand.  The increased production of poultry, pork, dalr, '2 fish
products would generate additional income for small farmers an help improve
rural nutritional standards.  Investments in cottage agro-industries  would
create additional productive activ'ties for export of woodcra4- -;.sroducts
and import substitution of fishmeal products.  Investments ;... C71-ni.
transportation, farm machinery repair shops, private irrigatio-r and on-farm
storage, and the various farm equipment, would support fa: r mechanLization
and li-vestock development.  Total annual incremental output at full
investment (ranging from 4 to 10 years) is summarized 4in the following
table:

7.02      Financial Viability.  In the Philippines, where climatic conditions
permit year-round farming in irrlgated areas, utilization of tractors is
.eceptionally high, and, therefore, the estimated financial rates of return
cs  tractor  nvestment  which accounts for 54% of the total project cost,
range from 21 to 47%.  The estimated rates of return on other investments are
also 'nigh (20 to over ,00%).  The derailed cash flow projections for the
various investments are in Annex 193, Tables 1-19, and the estimated financial
rates or return on investmernts Znnd   e related sensitivity analyses in
Annex 20.  The following summarizes the est4mated financial rates of return:

Total                  100              Over 45
7.03      Economic Viability.  The estimated economic rates of return on
investments are given in Annex 21, Tables 1-4, and summarized as follows:
Proportion of Total       Economic
Project Cost (%)    Rate of Return (%)
Farm Mechanization                 54             Over 100
On-farm Transportation             15                    51
Farm Facilities and
Equipment                        10                    33
Fisheries Development              10                    63
Livestock Development               9                    66
Cottage Agro-Industries             2                    79
Total                  100              Over  80
7.04      Foreign Exchange Gains.  As against the US$22.0 million for the
total foreign exchange cost of the investment, and US$4.4 million for the
incremental annual foreign exchange costs of operation, the project's net
annual foreign exchange gains would be about US$40.5 million.
7.05      Employment Effect.  The project would create about 10,000 new
jobs, and enhance the productivity of about 8,000 additional rural workers.
In addition, about 94,000 farm households hiring project tractors would gain
by increasing their income and using their family labor for more productive
work, such as crop care and backyard livestock farming (Annex 21, Table 6).
7.06      Income Effect.  At the estimated average 457 financial rate of
return, the estimated total annual incremental income accruing to the 8,000
beneficiaries from the project's total investment of about t 300 million
would be about f 100 million (US$14.7 million) after paying t 32 million
(US$4.7 million) in interest. The average beneficiary's annual incremental
net income would be about r 12,500 (US$1,800).  In addition, the beneficiaries
would pay annually about V 22 million (US$3 million) in incremental wages
for the workers filling the newly-created job opportunities. There would
be a further income effect for the 270 participating banks amounting to an
annual incremental gross income of about V 15.6 million (US$2.3 million), or
about V 58,000 (US$8,555) to an average participating bank.



- 22 -
7.07      Benefits to Small Farmers and Fishermen.  About 94,000 small
farmers would hire tractors for land preparation, and would profit from
custom work at reasonable rates. Most of them are too poor to own buffalo
or power tillers, and depend on custom work. Without the project, custom
rates could rise sharply, and hirers would probably have to pay much more
than the ' 140 per ha for rice farms projected under the project. In
addition, the project would create about 2,000 full-time job opportunities
for small subsistence fishermen, and equip a further 2,000 with more effi-
cient boats and fishing gear. The average annual catch per fisherman under
the project is expected to increase froti the present 1.0 ton to about 4.7
tons.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following principal
points, that:
(a)  the Government would extend the assignment of the ten
fisheries technicians with CB until full disbursement
of the proposed loan (para 5.18); and
(b)  the Central Bank of the Philippines would:
(i)  not finance under the project:  four-wheel tractors
of over 80 BHP (para 5.02); reconditioned trucks
without warranties comparable with those normally
issued for new trucks (para 5.03); mechanical threshers
with capacities exceeding 13 tons of paddy per day
(para 5.04); or fishing boats with tonnage exceeding
20 gross tons (para 5.05);
(ii) would engage, within 6 months of effectiveness, a
group of local experts, under terms and conditions
acceptable to IBRD, to study the financial and economic
impact of IBRD-financed rural credit projects (para 5.08);
(iii)  establish, within 6 months of project effectiveness,
a Technical Support and Evaluation Unit within DRBSLA,
to provide central technical support, monitor project
operations, and evaluate results at farm level (para 5.19);
(iv) take steps to introduce simplified lending procedures on
a trial basis immediately after effectiveness for small
loans of I 10,000 or less through participating banks
(para 5.20); and
(v)  institute a program to reduce the arrears of beneficiaries
to participating banks as outlined in paras 3.07-3.11.
8.02      The proposed project would be suitable for an IBRD loan of US$22.0
million for a term of 14 years including a four-year grace period.

PHILIPPINES
THIRD RURAL CREDIT PROJECT
The Central Bank of the Philippines
A. Organization and Management
1.        The Central Bank of the Philippines (CB) is a governmental
fiscal institution established in 1948 by Republican Act No. 265 as a
body corporate to administer the monetary and banking system of the
Philippines. Its objectives as defined in the amended Act are:
"(a) Primarily to maintain internal and external monetary
stability in the Philippines, and to preserve the in-
ternational value of the peso and convertibility of the
peso into other freely convertible currencies; and
(b) To foster monetary, credit and exchange conditions
conducive to a balanced and sustainable growth of the
economy."
2.        The CB is governed by a seven member Monetary Board composed
of the Governor of the CB as chairman, the Secretary of Finance, the
Director General of the National Economic Development Authority, the
cliairman of the Board of Investments and three part-time menabers from
the private sector. The chief executive is the Governor, who is assisted
by the Senior Deputy Governor, Deputy Governors and the staff at head-
quarters in Manila and three regional offices. The department responsible
for the administration of the CB-IBRD Rural Credit Projects is the Depart-
ment of Rural Banks and Savings and Loan Associations (DRBSLA), described
in paras 6 to 16.
B. Operational Results
3.        Resources and Assets.  The paid-up capital of the CB is still
P 10 million as at inception, but the total net worth has markedly
increased from P 292 million on December 31, 1971 to P 513 million on
November 30, 1973. The rapid expansion of CB money supply during the
same period is reflected in the increase of liabilities from P 6,621 mil-
lion to P 13,288 million and the growth of assets from p 6,913 million to



AMWRTE 4
Page  2
P 13,801 million (see Table 1 attached).  A significant change 's the in-
crease of international reserves from P 1,781 million to P 6,117 million
in less than two years.  As of November 30, 1973, the total gold reserve
was P 303 million, deposits with foreign banks amounted to P 5,777 million,
and other foreign currencies and securities to P 37 million. Liabilities
almost doubled with certificates of indebtedness grwing from P 422 mil'lon
to P 2,340 million (+555%); demand d1eposits from banking institutions X
creased from P 1,203 million to P 3,384 million (+281%).
4.        Inkcome and Expenses.  CBVs revenue and expenditure for:'-.
period January 1 to June 30, 1972 and the equivalent period in  7973 ,s
summarized as follows:
1/1 - 6/30/72      1/1 - 6/30/73      clhange
Ö---------- P million-     -             g--
Gross Income              184.8              200.9          + 8.7
Total Expenses            110.0              178.4          +62.2
Net Income                 74.8               22.5          -69.9
The net increase in gross income was mainly due to the increased interest
earnings on time and special deposits (P 103.4 million during the first
half of 1973 compared to P 25.3 million during the first half of 1972).
During the same time, interest payments almost doubled during the first
half year from P 59.6 million in 1972 to P 116.9 million in 1973, mostly
due to increases in interest on foreign loans.  Interest payments thus
increased from 55% to 66% of total expenses. Although considerably reduced
during the period under review, the net income remained at a satisfactory
level.
5.        Audit. According to Sect. 6 of the CB charter, the Auditor
General (now Commissioner of Audit) is the ex-officio auditor and appoints
a representative as the Auditor of the Central Bank. The Office of the
Auditor presently employs a total staff of 108 auditors of which two are
posted at DRBSLA.  All expenses of maintaining the office, including
salaries, are being paid by CB. The audit is performed concurrently and
is considered satisfactory.
C.  The Department of Rural Banks and Savings and Loan Associations
6.        Organization.  In early 1973, the Department of Rural Banks,
responsible for administering the first and second IBRD projects, was
merged with the Department of Savings and Loan Associations into the
Department of Rural Banks and Savings and Loan Associations (DRBSLA)
which would continue to be responsible for administering the on-going
and proposed projects. Details of the organizational structure are
shown in the attached organization chart. The Special Financing Group II



ANNEX 4
Page 3
under the direction of an Assistant Director will be in charge of the
project: the Special Agricultural Projects Division, assisted by Loan
Teams and Technicians in the field (para 7) would process and sanction
loan applications, whereas the Accounting Division would release funds
to participating banking institutions, handle counterpart funds, claim
reimbursements from IBRD and prepare the required reports. Other Groups
and Divisions of DRBSLA would supervise and audit the operations of
participating rural banks and stock savings and loan associations (SSLA)
and would provide the necessary supporting services.
7.        Management and Staff.  The DRBSLA is competently managed by a
Director and an Associate Director with long service in CB and substantial
experience in dealing with both rural banks and SSLAs. They are assisted
by capable senior officers and a staff of about 500.
8.        The Special Agricult:ural Projects Division has a total staff
of 23, including the Manila Lcan Team which processes and sanctions loan
applications from areas not covered by the five Loan Teams stationed in
Lingayen (Pangasinan), Cabanatuan City (Nueva Ecija), Bacolod City
(Visayas), Cagayan de Oro City (Northern Mindanao), and Davao (Southern
Mindanao). Loan Teams are manned by a Loan Officer who is a certified
public accountant with considerable experience in banking, one or two Loan
Processors (also certified public accountants), and one or more Loan Eval-
uators, who may either be agricultural engineers or agriculturalists. There
are presently 62 CB agricultural technicians stationed in the field and 12
fisheries technicians, two employed by CB and 10 from the Fisheries Commis-
sion working full-time for DRBSLA. It is essential that the assignment of
the 10 fisheries technicians be extended until full disbursement of the
proposed project. The number as well as the qualifications and capability
of the technical staff in the field are considered satisfactory and should
be sufficient to cope with the increased number of loans under the proposed
project, particularly if simplified procedures for small loans are intro-
duced (para 10). Additional Loan Teams may, however, be stationed in stra-
tegic places to help speed up loan approvals.
9.        Loan Proes       Procedures.  Under present procedures, appli-
cants file loan applications on a prescribed form with a qualified rural
bank, preferably the one nearest the project to be financed.  The bank
conducts the credit investigation, i.e. verifies the project to be financed
and inspects and assesses the collateral offered. The CB agricultural
or fisheries technician prepares the Farm and Home Plan and the feasibility
study within the time limit prescribed by DRBSLA. If the rural bank
approves the application, it endorses it and submits it together with the
inspection report on collaterals and a complete set of supporting docu-
ments (inciuding statemenLs of financial condition and income and expendi-
ture of the bank) to the Loan Team assigned to the area. The Loan Team
checks the eligibility of the rural bank, scrutinizes the loan application
and supporting documents and may inspect the farm. The Loan Officer will
finally sanction or reject the loan application without further reference



ANNEX 4
Page 4
to headquarters. On his advice, the Accounts Division in headquarters
will release the loan to the rural bank according to the schedule of loan
disbursements.
10.       The decentralization of loan approval and the stationing of
CB technicians in thie field is an improvement on the centralized loan
processing procedures of the first project. However, processing time is
still long, because of tle time taken to inspect the land for collateral,
to register the mortgages, and obtain tax assessments, etc. Also, CB
tech,nicians, often stationed at long distances from applicants, have to
schedule their route economically and are not always able to attend to
applicants immediately. The undesirably large average loan amount under
the on-going project (about P 33,200) may well be attributable to the fact
that farmers and rural banks do not think it worthwhile to go through a
long, costly and cumbersome loan processing procedure for small loans.
Therefore, to speed up loan processing and encourage small scale lending,
it has been agreed at negotiations that application procedures for loans up
to an amount of V 10,000 (US$1,475) be simplified as follows:
(a) authorize privately-hired production technicians employed
by participating lending institutions working on short-term
supervised credit schemes to prepare farm and home plans
and feasibility studies after having successfully completed
appropriate training with CB, so that CB technicians could
concentrate on larger loans;
(b) encourage participating banks to accept chattel mortgages,
or (where appropriate) sureties and Government guarantees,
as collateral instead of land; and
(c) reduce the paperwork required for documentation.
All loan applications should remain subject to final review and sanction
or rejection by the Loan Officer responsible for the area; Loan Teams
or C1B technicians should do post audits at random. The simplified
procedures should be first instituted by rural banks which have partici-
pated in the first or second project; others should follow only after
having gained experience with the project. It is estimated that up to
20% of all sub-loans under the project could be processed in the simpli-
fied manner.
11.       Technical Support and Evaluation Unit.  Although decentraliza-
tion has speeded up loan processing, it has, to some extent, isolated CB
technicians and Loan Teams from access to technical know-how and informa-
tion which is more readily available at headquarters. There is also a
greater need for project coordination. The technicians are capable and
qualified in thieir own fields hut tliev cannot be expected to be familiar
witlh the full range of the most scital,le and up-to-date techniques in
agriculturail arid livestock sleve1opTrent to assist all loan applicants and



Page 5
rural bank borrowers.  There is insufficient technical guidance and
direction at present, since DIBSLA staff is largelv engaged in loan
processing; even at headquarters there are no qualified personnel to
undertake these functions on a full-time basis. In addition, by monitor-
ing and evaluating project results at the farm level, many valuable
lessons can be learned which could be applied in other cases if such
information were collected in one place and made available to all field
staff.
12.       It was, therefore, agreed at negotiations that a Technical Support
and Evaluation Unit be established by CB, preferably as a Division of the
Special Financing Group of DRBSLA which is responsible for medium and long
term loan operations. The Unit should be headed bv an agricultural economist,
and staffed with three agriculturalists (one specialized in crors, one in
livestock and one in agricultural engineering), statisticians and secretaries.
Its mnain functions would be to maintain liaison with Government agencies and
research institutions engaged in agriculture and fisheries development, to
collect information applicable to developments financed under the project for
dissemination to management, technicians and Loan Teams. The specialists
should be able to give technical guidance and direction in individual cases.
The lUnit should also monitor project operations and evaluate results at the
farrm level. The findings, together wiith any pertinent comments from field
staff and rural bankers, should be processed by the Unit and made available
to all involved in the project with a view to improving further operations.
13.       Service Vehicles.  The 61 vehicles financed under the Second
Rural Credit Project are still operating and most of them should last
through the disbursement period of the proposed project.  As no substanti-al
increase of field staff is envisaged, financing for more service vehicles
is not proposed under the project.
14.       Training.  DRBSLA provides and organizes the following courses
for the staff and management of rural banks, SSLAs and other institutions:
(a)  A Special Training Course of three weeks at thie CB
Training Institute for officers and employees of new
rural banks - and separately for personnel of SSLAs -
to familiarize them with laws, rules and regulations
and accounting methods. In the case of newly estab-
lished banks or associations, this is followed up by
on-the-job training under the guidance of officers of
the Institute;
(b)  A Basic Banking Course of six weeks in banking, commercial
and banking law, accounting, and agricultural economics;
held also at the CB Training Institute, for personhel of
rural banks and separately for savings and loan associations;



AK.TX 4
Page 6
(c)  A SuDervised Farm Credit Course to train agricultural tech-
nicians for rural banks, held at the Agricultural Credit
and Cooperatives Institute (ACCI) at Los Banos;
(d)  The Fxecutive Development Program, a one-week seminar for
directors and managers of rural banks held at the Develop-
r,ent Academy of the Philippines. lagaytav, City, to teach
efficient management withi4 the framework of national goals;
(e)  A training prograr for participants (rural bankers) from
other countries; and
(f)  A Supervised Farm Credit course for US Peace Corps volunteers
assigned to rural banks in the Philippines.
15.       Since the inception of the rural banking system (1952) and the
establishment of savings and loan associations (1964) a total of 6,874
participants from rural banks and 759 from savings and loan associations
have been training in Special Training and Basic Banking courses. In
addition, 629 technicians were trained and 492 rural bankers participated
in Executive Development courses.  The training facilities and programs
are satisfactory and have considerably contributed to the success of the
rural bank and savings and loan association operations.
16.       Lending Terms.  Under the Second Rural Credit Project, CB pays
IBRD- an interest rate of 6.5,' p.a. and 5Y p.a. on Government counterpart
funds.  The original formula established for financing the new investments
was that IBRD would contribute 50%, the Government 30%, rural banks 10/%
and ultimate beneficiaries 10%. Inder this formula, CB pays an average
rate of 5.94% on borrowed funds. Rural banks are charged a blended rate
of 7%' p.a. (5% on Government counterpart funds and 8.2% on the IBRD con-
tribution).  Thus, CE's interest margin was 1.06% per annun.  This formula
was later amended so that IBPRD contributes 50%, Government 40% and bene-
ficiaries 10%.  On the basis of the amended formula, the rate charged to
rural banlcs on IBRD funds should be 8.67 p.a. to arrive at a blended rate
of 77 per annur.  For the T1ird Rural Credit Project, the original financing
formula woulcl be reintroduced.  lowever, the Bank's lending rate would be
7-1/47 annually. As the Government wishes to maintain the lending rate of
12`' n.a. to the ultimate beneficiary and 77 p.a. to participating banks, CB's
inLcrest margin would he reduced from 1.067 to 0.597 per annum.  Including
th-ie return from the first and second project, CB's annual income from the
program would be about P 2.0 million for the first year and about P 2.8 million
after full disbursement of the project.  This should be sufficient to cover
administrative expenses.
17.       Maturities of loars to rural banks approximately coincide with
those to the ultimate beneficiary so that rural banks do not have addi-
tional benefits from relending the same funds.  CB may relend principal
repavments received from rural, banks not required to amortize the first,
second or the proposed loan.

18.       CB has established Rules and Regulations governing, the CB - iBR?D
projects which have been revised at negotiations to incorporate thc changes
required for the proposed project. Such Rules and Regulations establishl
criteria for the eligibility of the banking institution an d rrowJrs to
participate and regulate the administration of the project,. The revi sed Rules
and Regulations would also cover SSLAs and any change would be subJect to
IBRD's approval.
19.       Examination.  Under the provisions of both the Rural Banks  Act
and the Savings and Loan Associations Act, the Monetary Board has the power
to supervise the businesses and corpDrate operations of the rural banks
and SSLAs. The CB department responsible is DRBSLA which conducts special
examinations of rural banks and SSLAs.  Most of its staff is engaged in
this task. During a regular examination, at least two examiners do a
thorough audit of the accounts, the lending operations and the collaterals
held by the institution. A regular examination is supposed to be carried
out at least once a year. However, this goal was not achieved in 1973
(only 332 out of 588 rural banks were audited by October 31, 1`73 and 31
out of 35 SSLAs in 1972), as many examiners were engaged in the "Masagana 99"
short term lending operations for increased rice production.  Special examina-
tions are conducted at any time CE deems it necessary to check cash or other
transactions, to follow up corrective measures recommended during the previous
examination or to investigate irregularities discovered in the operations of
the institution. In 1973, 184 such special examinations of rural banks were
carried out by October 31. UTpon proof that the rural bank or SSLA is con-
ducting the affairs of the institution in a manner contrary to la7 or Tfonetary
Board's rules and regulations and instructions, or against public or Covern-
ment interest, the Monetary Board designates the Director of DRESLA to take
over the management of the institution and to rehabilitate or liquidate it.
By the end of 1972, 34 rural banks (5.7,' of total) were found to be "dis-
tressed" and under management (2), close supervision (19) or liauidation (13).
After CB assumed the supervision of savings and loan associations in 19r3,
177 out of 254 non-stock associations were dissolved, while there has been
no dissolution of SSLAs.

PHILIPPINES
THIRD RURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Rural Banks
A. Background, Organization and Functions of the Rural Bank System
History
1.        The Rural Bank Program is the culmination of almost half a century
of Government sponsored efforts to establish a banking system that will
provide credit facilities to small farmers and small commercial and indus-
trial entrepreneurs in rural areas. Since 1907, some 15 legislative
measures have been adopted by the Government. Among these were those au-
thorizing the establishment of Agricultural Credit Banks (1908), a system
of agricultural credit cooperative associations (1915), the Philippine
National Bank (1916), and rural banks and commodity corporations which
engaged mostly in marketing loans. Most of these credit organizations
are no longer in existence and many failed because of lack of trained
personnel, insufficient capital and the absence of rediscounting facili-
ties. On June 6, 1952, the Congress of the Republic of the Philippines
passed the Rural Banks' Act, and thus laid the foundation for the present
rural banking system, which has become an effective instrument to provide
a large number of producers in rural areas with banking facilities.
Objectives and Legal Basis
2.        The Rural Banks' Act states the Government's policy to "promote
and expand the rural economy in an orderly and effective manner by provid-
ing the people in the rural communities with the means of facilitating
and improving their productive activities and to encourage cooperatives.
Towards this end, the Government encourages and assists in the establish-
ment of a system of rural banks which will place within the easy reach and
access of the people credit facilities on reasonable terms". In additions
Presidential Decree No. 57 of November 19, 1972 on agrarian reform requires
rural banks "to provide immediate source of funds to augment loans/credits
to be made available to the tenants and/or farmers cooperatives ..."
3.        The Rural Banks' Act 1/ requires the Monetary Board of the Central
Bank of the Philippines (CB) to formulate rules and regulations governing
1/   Republic Act No. 720 of June 6, 1952, as amended; the last amendment
was by Presidential Decree No. 122 of January 29, 1973.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
the establishment and operations of rural banks. Pursuant to this power,
the Monetary Board has promulgated several sets of rules and regulations
which are intended to implement the Rural Banks' Act and which, together
with the Monetary Board's letters of instruction and CB circulars, form
the rural banks' main operational basis. The provisions of the General
Banking Law and the Central Bank Law are also part of the laws governing
rural banks in so far as they are applicable and not in conflict with any
provision of the Rural Banks' Act. As rural banks are organized in the
form of a stock corporation, the provisions of the Law on Private Corpora-
tions are supplementary to the above laws.
The Role of the Central Bank
4.        CB acts as a refinance institution of rural banks (paras 15-16)
and through DRBSLA (Annex 4, paras 6-8) provides them with technical
assistance, training of management and staff, and supervises and examines
rural bank operations (Annex 4, paras 9-15, 19).
Privileges and Exemptions
5.        Privileges.  Rural banks enjoy the advantage of free training
of officers and employees (Annex 4, paras 14-15) and free technical
assistance to accounts staff and inspectors when opening a bank. Since
the introduction of supervised credit, agricultural and fisheries techni-
cians, directly or indirectly paid for by CB, assist rural banks in
processing loan applications and supervise the use of funds by borrowers
(Annex 4, paras 9-10). Various extension services help farmers to adopt
modern farming methods thus making them better credit risks. The Depart-
ment of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the Department of Trade and
Tourism and other appropriate Government agencies are enjoined to cooperate
with rural banks and provide advice to their borrowers. Up to January 1973,
rural banks did not share in the cost of supervision by DRBSLA, but since
then they are required to pay, as any other bank, an annual fee not exceed-
ing 1/20% of their assets (excluding cash reserves). Financial privileges
comprise the provision of low-cost supplemental capital in the form of
preferred stock (para 12), liberal rediscount facilities (para 15) and
the participation in special financing programs (para 16).
6.        Exemptions.  Rural banks and their borrowers or mortgagors
are exempted from any fees, charges and documentary stamp taxes relative
to loans or transactions of less than P 5,000. In addition, the Rural
Banks' Act grants rural banks absolute exemption from any taxes, charges
and fees if the bank's net assets do not exceed P 1 million (excluding
paid-in Government counterpart capital). If the net assets are between
P 1 and 3 million, the taxes, charges and fees are levied in proportion



ANNEX 5
Page 3
to the excess over P 1 million. Rural banks with net assets of more
than P 3 million pay taxes and fees like any other bank. 1/
Number and Distribution of Rural Banks
7.        The rural banking system has steadily grown.  By October 313 1973
a total number of 622 banks had been established since 1952 with 606 still
in operation (14 are in liquidation and 2 under reorganization). Another
67 banks are in the process of organization and 87 more appliations are
being processed by CB. The Four-Year Development Program for the rural
banking system (1974-77) provides for the establishment of an additional
100 rural banks annually against an average of 45 for the last three years.
Out of the 622 rural banks, 22$ (37%) are participating in the CB-IBRD
projects. The breakdown per region is as follows:
Total No.          No. Rural Banks Participating
Rural Banks               in CB-IBRD Projects__
Luzon                  412                   158            (38%)
Visayas                 130                   43            (33%)
Mindanao                 80                    27           (34%)
TOTAL                622                   228            (37%)
The regional distribution is shown in more detail on the attached map.
1/   (a)  Under the Internal Revenue Code, the income tax rate for domestic
corporations is 25% of the taxable net income up to P 100,000 and
35% of that over and above P 100,000.
(b)  The Privilege Tax on Business and Occupation for banks is a fixed
amount of P 500 a year.   I
(c)  The Tax on Banks is 5% of gross receipts derived from interest,
discounts, dividends, commissions and other gross income realized
during the calendar year.
(d)  The annual Residence Tax amounts to P 5.00 plus a tax not exceed-
ing P 2,000 on the basis of (a) P 2.00 for every P 5,000 worth of
real property and P 2.00 for every P 5,000 gross receipts or earn-
ings derived by the corporation during the preceding year.

The Rural Bankers Association of the Philipplnes
8.        In 1955, 18 banks formed an unincorporated association which in
1957 was incorporated as the Rural Bankers Association of the Philippines.
(RBAP) and presently has more than 500 members.  RBAP active.y :-sexs
its members? point of view in all dealings with CB and the Gov2nmcnt and
participates in the formulation of laws and policies affecting rura.-
banks.  It liaises with organizations such as the Agricultural .;achinerv
Dealers Association (AMDA) and plays an important role in public relations
on behalf of its members.  It has developed into a strong and efz-cive
organization.
B. Organization and Operations of Rural Banks
Organization and Management
9.        Persons of Filipino citizenship and/or cooperatives or barrio
associations 1/ can organize the establishment of rural banks, provided
that a majority of stockholders are actual residents of the community
where the bank is to be located and own the controlling stock therein
and the initial capital is at least R 100,000. No individual family
group can own more than 20% of the voting shares, no interlocking direc-
torate with other rural banks is allowed, and the directors and key officers
should not be relatives within the third degree of consanguinity or affinity.
10.       Rural banks are stock corporations, managed by a board of 5-11
directors who must be Filipino citizens and shareholders of voting common
stock. The executive officers are the president, the vice-president,
manager, treasurer or cashier, and secretary. To ensure managerial quali-
fications, the Monetary Board requires directors to be at least 25 years
old, college graduates or having at least 5 years of business experience,
or arn acceptable banking training. The president is the chief executive
and presides in all stoc'kholders' or directors' meetings, unless the bank
has elected a chairman of its board; if the bank is small, he may also
be concurrently the manager.
ai,a.o-ial. Resources
11.       The resources of rural banks consist of their own capital
(preferred and common stock and reserves), deposits from the public and
borrowings from CB through rediscounting of notes and participation in
special financing programs.
1/   A biarrio (vil1age) association or Samahang Nayon is a form of a pre-
cooperative; membership is mandatory for participation in the agrarian
reform program.



ANNEX 5
Page 5
12.       Preferred stock.  The Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)
holds preferred stock in rural banks, because CB cannot directly invest
in stock corporations. Its purpose is to match the private investment
with Government counterpart capital assistance up to a 50:50 ratio.
DBP, subject to availability of funds, furnishes this supplementary
capital not exceeding P 1 million per bank, and the rural bank issues
the preferred stock. The capital assistance is to be utilized solely
for lending under the supervised credit program. The banks, within
three years from the start of operations, have set up a sinking fund
for the retirement of the preferred shares. If, in the Monetary Board's
opinion, the rural bank has accumulated enough capital strength, or the
private sector offers to replace the Government investment, preferred
shares may be required to be retired. DBP is entitled to dividends of
not more than 2% each time the bank declares dividends on common stocks.
13.       Common stock.  As required by the Corporation Law, the incor-
porators of a corporation must subscribe to at least 20% of the authorized
capital stock (minimum P 100,000). Only common stockholders exercise
management, proprietary and remedial rights. A recent development ini-
tiated by Government is that barrio associations and cooperatives may buy
shares in existing rural banks. The aim is to broaden the capital basis
of the banks and to change their generally conservative attitude towards
lending to small farmers. The extent to which cooperative organizations
may buy shares in any bank has not been specified but is expected not to
exceed 49%.
14.       Deposits.  Rural banks are entitled to accept savings, time
and demand deposits after having received authority from CB to do so.
Banks with a capital of not less than P 100,000 (P 200,000 in the case
of demand deposits) and adequate facilities and staff normally qualify.
ihe maximum rate of interest is 6% p.a. for savings deposits and 8% p.a.
for time deposits, in accordance with the following schedule:
180 days  -  6.5%
270 days - 7%
360 days - 8%,
Demand deposits do no>- ^arn any interest. There are three measures to
protect rura. bank dep&Atiiors:  (a) deposit accounts not exceeding P 10,000
per depositor must be insured with the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corpora-
tion; (b) the bank must maintain minimum reserves against deposit liabilities
(14% of demand deposits, .2% of savings deposits and 10% of time deposits);
and (c) it must maintain a minimum capital of 10% of its assets (excluding
cash reserves and contingent assets). Although interest rates do not seem
very attractive in a country with very high interest rates for non-institu-
tional credit, rural banks succeeded in obtaining a total of P 413.1 million
in deposits (90% of which was savings deposits) as of September 30, 1973,
compared to P 329.5 million as of December 31, 1972, an increase of 25%.

15.       Rediscounting.  CB rediscounts eligible papers (promissory
notes) up to 80% of the outstanding balance of the unpaid portion of such
papers at the time of rediscounting. For supervised production credit
for rice, corn and sugar, the maximum amount granted may be 100%. The
maturities of papers secured by loans for agricultural and industrial
purposes may not exceed 270 days (360 days in case of loans to coopera-
tives and 180 days for commercial papers from the date of rediscount).
The maturities of the loans must not exceed one year; loans to agrarian
reform beneficiaries must have maturities not earlier than two months
after harvest.  Rediscount rates charged against rural banks are 3% p.a.
for loans under supervised credit schemes. If rural banks hire technicians,
their costs are deductible from the interest on rediscounts payable to CB
up to a maximum rebate of 2% of the interest rate. A rural bank may not
rediscount with CB more than 300% of its net worth (100% in case of non-
supervised credit) plus 50% of its monthly average savings deposit liabili-
ties for the four months preceding the date of rediscounting. Rural banks
with past due loans exceeding 25% of their total outstanding loans (ex-
clusive of loans granted to beneficiaries of agrarian reform and under the
Agricultural Guarantee and Loan Fund and CB-IBRD special financing pro-
grams) are disqualified from rediscounting (para 37).
16.       Special Financing Programs.  CB channels funds for short term
(up to 1 year), medium term (1-5 years) and long term (over 5 years) loans
through qualified rural banks under special financing programs, introducing
supervised credit. The funds are lent to the banks as special time depo-
sits, secured by promissory notes. The first of such programs was the
First Rural Credit Project (Loan 432-PH), followed by the Second Rural
Credit Project (Loan 607-PHi). Other special programs - mostly with
USAID participation - are the Agricultural Guarantee and Loan Fund (AGLF)
for medium and long term loans to farmers and cooperatives, which also
protects participating banks against losses (up to 70%); the Small Fish-
erman's Special Credit Fund for the acquisition of fishing boats, engines,
accessories, nets and other fishing gear by small marine fishermen; the
Special Agricultural Loan Fund for granting production loans for a maximum
period of three years to farmers who form a "compact farm" 1/ of at least
five farmers who assume joint and several liability for the loan; the
Agricultural Loan Fund for agrarian reform beneficiaries organized in
cooperatives or "seldas" 2/; the CB Loan and Guarantee Fund for loans and
guarantees to rural banks7farmers in areas affected by the devastating
1a   Unregistered group of farmers with contiguous farms of approximately
equal productive capability, fully irrigated, for purposes of consoli-
dating separate, individual resources, methods and activities by cul-
tivating the aggregate consolidated area as one unit under a single
management.

floods and drought of June and July 1972; the Agricultural Loan (Calamity)
Fund - Hand Tractor and Work Animal Loan Program for loans to farmers for
the purchase of hand tractors and work animals; the "Masagana 99" Rice
Production Program for the production of high yielding rice varieties in
43 major rice producing provinces covering more than 500,000 ha of irri-
gated and 100,000 ha of rainfed lands during the crop year 1973!74; and
the Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund for the establishment, expansion
or refinancing of small scale export-oriented or cottage industries.
Each of these programs has a set of rules and regulations governing its
administration.
17.       Status of Financial Resources.  The rural banking system con-
tinues to show an impressive growth (a statement of comparative balance
sheets 1968-1973 is attached as Table 1). The status as of September 30,
1973 is summarized as follows:
Amount                 % of Total
P M (US$ M)
Capital
Preferred stock           86.9
Common stock             128.9

Central Bank and
other banks            563.2      976.3 (144.0)                76%
TOTAL                    1,291.2 (190.4)                100%
The increase of total resources over December 31, 1972 amounted to
P 308.9 million (US$45.6 million) or 24% during the nine month period,
compared to 25% during the preceding twelve months.  Rural banks' own
resources increased by about 12% annually over the last five years.
Total liabilities increased from P 694.4 million (US$102.4 million) by
P 281.9 million (US$41.6 million) or 41% during the nine month period,
which was primarily due to the introduction of the "Masagana 99" rice
production program and the increased disbursements under the CB-IBRD
program.

Lending Operations
18.       Limitations.  According to the Rural Banks' Act, loans and
advances by rural banks must be primarily for the purpose of meeting
the credit need > of small farmers or farm families owning or cultivating,
in the aggregate, not more than 50 ha of land dedicated to agricultural
production. They may also attend to the normal credit needs of coopera-
tives and small merchants and small business enterprises whose capital
-invested does not exceed P 100,000. Medium and long term loans may be
extended by banks with an unimpaired capital of not less than Pi 100,000
and savings and time deposits of at least it 100,000.  Investments in
equities of other enterprises are only allcwed for minority holdings in
allied undertakings up to 25% of the bank's net worth. Otherwise, rural
banks provide normal banking facilities as required by rural communities.
For the purpose of determining the need for prior authority from CB,
rural bank lending may be classifled into ordinary and special. Newly
organized rural banks are authorized to make ordinary short term loans
without the need of further CB authority, whereas for medium and long
term loans, such permission is required. Apart from the normal require-
ments for ordinary lending, rural banks have to fulfill additional condi-
tions before they qualify to participate in the various special financing
programs (paras 16, 27).
19.       Volume.  Total lend.Lng operations by the rural banking system
have i.ncreased substantially over the last four years (Table 2). The
following table highlights the expansion from 1968 to 1972:
Number of Loans                          Loan Amount

The table illustrates the accelerated increase in the number of loans made
as well as in the amount lent.  The faster increase in terms of amount re-
flects thie constantly growing average loan amount, which has gone up from
P 3,400 in 1953 to P 14,900 in 1972 (Table 3 attached).

20.       Distribution.  Lending in 1971 and 1972 to different sectors of
the economy is summarized in the following table (details Table 2 attaheed):
1971                          1972

TOTAL    471.7 100.0 678.7  100.0       527.9 100.0 785.2  100.0
The percentage of agricultural loans has increased from 89.8% to 90.2%,
which shows that rural banks' emphasis on loans to agriculture has been
even further accentuated. In terms of loans outstanding agricultural
loans increased from P 573.0 million as of December 31, 1972 to P 590.3
million as of September 30, 1973, excluding loans overdue or in litigation.
21.       Loan Sizes.  A total of about 527,000 loans were granted by all
rural banks in 1972 for an aggregate amount of about P 785.2 million. A
classification of loans according to size is provided in the following
table (data for 1968 through 1972 are shown in attached Table 5):
No.    % of    Amount   % of
1972                     '000   Total    P M      Total
Total loans granted:                527.2   100.0   785.2    100.0
Cumulative up to P 2,000 (US$295) 440.4    83.4   237.4        43.0
Cumulative up to P 5,000 (US$737) 509.6    96.6   577.6        73.6
P 5,000-P 10,000 (US$737-1,475)    12.8       2.4    96.8      12.3
P 10,000 and above (US$1,475
and above)                          5.5     1.0   110.8      14.1
About 96.6% of all loans, accounting for 73.6% of the total amount advanced
during the year, were made in small loan amounts of up to P 5,000.  This
illustrates that rural banks in fact reach a large number of small

operators and fulfill their role of serving the less affluent sections
in rural communities, apart from assisting larger and progressive farmers
with a higher absorptive capacity. The pattern of loan distribution by
size has been fairly constant over the last five years.
22.       Securities.  The following table 3hows, in a summarized form,
loans granted in 1972 by type of security (details for 1968-1972 in
Table 5):
Type of Security           No. of Loans  % of Total  Amount P M  % of Total
Real Estate Mortgage         348,400          66        608.0          77
Chattel Mortgage,
guarantees, sureties,
bank deposits, pledges
of crops                   141,300          27        140.2          18
Unsecured                     38,200           7          37.0          5
TOTAL                   527,900         100        785.2         100
This demonstrates the generally conservative attitude of rural bankers
concerning collateral but also indicates their flexibility in granting
loans on securities other than land and even in advancing unsecured loans.
Further information on rural banks' collateral requirements, their evalua-
tion and future role as envisaged for the proposed project, is presented in
Annex 7.
23.       Loan Periods.  In 1972 rural banks made about 484,700 advances
(91.8%) for P 662.6 million (84.4%) for short term agricultural purposes
and about 4,500 (0.9%) agricultural loans for about P 46.0 million (5.9%)
for medium and long term purposes (Table 2). The latter comprises a
comparatively small portion of total lending and was made possible only
due to the introduction of the special financing programs, of which the
CB-IBRD projects account for 47% in terms of loan amount.
The First CB-IBRD Rural Credit Project (Table 6 attached)
24.       IBRD contributed US$5.0 million to the First Rural Credit
Project (Loan 432-PH), which became effective on January 27, 1966 and
was fully disbursed by September 30, 1969. The project was a break-
through in providing farmers, through qualified rural banks, with medium
and long term loans under supervised credit for the purchase of tractors,
power tillers and farm implements; swine, poultry and fishery development;
and the construction of private on-farm irrigation systems. Under the
project a total of P 38.6 million was loaned to about 2,600 farmer
beneficiaries through 148 rural banks. IBRD contributed P 21.4 million
(55.4%) to project cost, Government P 9.7 million (25.0%), rural banks
P 1.8 million (4.8%) and farmers and others P 5.7 million (14.8%). Of

IBRD's contribution, P 19.2 million (89.3%) was for 2,118 farm mechaniza-
tion loans and the balance for irrigation sub-projects, livestock and fish-
ery development. As of October 31, 1973, CB had repaid US$2.3 million
(46%) of the US$5.0 million loan, whereas rural banks had repaid P 15.5
million (73%) of P 21.2 million released to them. Due to the peso devalua-
tion in February 1970, CB's repayment obligation in terms of local currency
increased by about P 11.2 million. Of the 148 participating rural banks,
122 had overdue loans amounting to ibout P 5.3 million or 42.6% of P 12.5
million IBRD contributions outstanding under the project (para 32).
The Second Rural Credit Project (Table 7 attached)
25.       Loan Purpose and Volume.  To continue the first project, a
second IBRD loan of US$12.5 million was provided under the Second Rural
Credit Project (Loan 607-PH) which became effective on August 14, 1969.
The loan purposes remained basically the same with some diversification
to enlarge the number of crops to be financed and to include such items
as storage and processing facilities, which were introduced during project
implementation. As of September 30, 1973, total credit extended to
228 participating rural banks and 3,253 farmer-borrowers amounted to
P 105.7 million, summarized as follows:
Total Amount   % of         IBRD        % of

26.       Financing of Investments.  Total cost of project investments
aggregated P 125.6 million (US$18.5 million) as of September 30, 1973.
As shown below, IBRD contributed 47.1% to investment costs, less than
the maximum 50% provided under the Agreement.

Uuner the first and second project, rural bankrs partlcipzted^ -thLth 10%
of the investment cost from their own resources.  This requirement was
waived in the course of the second project, however, thie actual partici-
pation of a:l rural banks was 8.1% as of September 30, 1973. Under the
proposed loan, rural banks will be required to contribute on average XO2%
but CB may decide to reduce it to 5% in case of young banks with limited
resources in accordance with objective criteria to be established, as long
as the overall average of 10% is maintained.
27.       Qualifications for Participation in CB-IBRD               According
to the special Rules and Regulations governing loans under the CB-IBRD
project, DRBSLA evaluates the cred-it-worthiness of rural banks t-hat wish
to participate in the project, taking into account the followi:ag:  the
bank must have been in operation for at least one year; it must have
sufficient liquidity to meet obligations to creditors and depositors;
have sound loan investments as to collateral, capacity to pay and character
of borrower; arrears may not exceed 25% of portfolio; has established a
credit reputation with CB; has a management with competence and integrity,
and has sufficient unimpaired capital1 and adequate reserves, as well as
positive operating results.  Qualified banks enter into a credit line
agreement with CE. Each rural bank assumes the credit risk of loans
extended by it. The bank executes a promissory note covering each loan
received from CB and, as security for such loans, endorses in favor of CB
promissory notes executed by individual borrowers covering the total
amount borrowed from the rural bank.
2bi.      The interest rate rural banks pay to CB is a blended rate of
7Z p.a.:  it is compound of 5% p.a. on the Government counterpart fund
(if AGLF, a 1% guarantee fee is added), and 8.2% p.a. on the IBRD portion
(Annex 4, para 16).  Farmer beneficiaries pay a rate of 12% p.a. on loans
under the pre'-ious and ?roposed  projects.  This is the maximum rate laid
down by the Monetary Board s Rules and Regulations for rural banks and

Republic Act No. 6390. 1/ Except under the CB-IBRD projects, interest may
be collected in advance.
29.       The maturities of the notes executed by a rural bank in favor
of CB shall approximately corresponG to the schedule of repayment by
end-user borrowers; the maximum period varies from 3 to 10 years, denend-
ing on loan purposes as follows:
Farm Implements                4 years
Light machineries              4 years
Heavy machineries               7 years
New trucks                      7 years
Reconditioned trucks           4 years
Irrigation equipment           5 years
Irrigation civil work         10 years
Livestock development          7 years
Fishing boats                 10 years
Fishponds and fishpens        10 years
Storages                      10 years
Agro-Industries                 7 years
30.       Portfolio.  As of September 30, 1973, total outstanding under
the second CB-IBRD project was P 80 million (US$11.8 million) from
2,953 borrowers, of which 584 (20%) borrowed less than F 8,000 each
(totalling P 2.8 million) and 2,369 (80%) more than P 8,000 (totalling
P 77.8 million). Of the total amount of P 95.5 million released from CB
to rural banks, P 8.9 million have been repaid, leaving a balance out-
standing of P 86.6 million. Collections from farmers and repayment by
rural banks to CB are disappointing (paras 32-33).
31.       Disbursement.  The original closing date of March 31, 1973 has
been extended to June 30, 1974. As of April 16, 1974, IBRD disbursements
amounted to about US$11.6 million. If the rate of disbursement observed
during the last six months continues, full disbursement will be achieved by
the closing date. As of March 25, 1974, only about US$42,000 of the US$12.5
million loan remained uncommitted.  The first loan amortization of US$452,000,
due on June 1, 1973, has been paid to IBRD.
1/   This rate is in line with other institutional credit.  For comparison,
the interest rate the Development Bank of the Philippines charges for
medium and long term agricultura] development loans is also 12% p.a.
The rates of the Phiilippine National Bank (normally short-term crop
and commodity loans) vary according to the security offered:  127 p.a.
if secured by real estate mortgage or Government bonds; 13% p.a. if
covered by chattel mortgages and 14% p.a. for unsecured loans. The
Agricultural Credit Administration (ACA) may charge up to 12% p.a.
(including service fees and other charges), but is presently still
charging the old rate of 87 p.a. on unsecured but supervised short
term production loans up to a maximum of P 2,000, and 8% p.a. on all
commodity loans.  Commercial banks charge up to 147 p.a. for short term
loans.

The arrears in percent of loan portfoli o have been close to 20% over thle

about 18% is observed as of September 30, 1973 due to t.ee fast expanding
Portfolio.  Performance undcr diffferent progra-ms varies considerably.
Surprisingly, repavment under non-supervised credit operations (mainly
short term) was much better than under supervised credit schemes with

is no marked improvement over previous periods. The rate was 58.8% at
the end of 1971 and 55.6% at the end of 1972.  With rapidly increasing
loan portfolios and more loans falling due, the situation may become un-
manageable and the viability and proper functioning of many banks may be
in danger, if collections are not quickly and substantially improved.
34.       U1nder existing rules, rural banks may reschedule loans in
deserving cases where borrowers have not made any amortization payment
for two consecutive periods and where the reason for non-payment is
beyond the borrower's control as verified by the bank and confirmed by
CB. Eligible causes for non-payment may be losses due to natural hazards
in areas which Government has declared as "calamity areas". Restructuring
of CB-IBRD loans would normally be within the original period of the loan,
although a one year extension may now be granted, provided the defaulter
repaid all penalties and interest due. In the case of short term loans,
defaulters have to pay at least 30% of principal before the unpaid balance
may be extended by one half of the original period of the loan. Resched-
uling on this formula may be repeated once. The penalty is 5% p.a. on the
past due account over and above the original interest rate. Very few
rural banks have made use of the possibility to reschedule overdue
accounts. This may be due to the fairly cumbersome procedure, but more
likely because it is more profitable to have overdue accounts on which an
extra 5% p.a. can be charged. The policies regarding penalties for late
paVments need to be reviewed and it should be ensured that farmers are
fully aware of the additional charges. Borrowers who are able to pay should
feel sufficient pressure to fulfill their commitments on time or even have
incentives to repay in advance.
35.       Rural banks with past dues exceeding 25% of their loan port-
folio do not qualify to participate in the CB-IBRD project. As the
average is 17.9% (September 30, 1973) it is assumed that most banks would
be eligible. However, a more meaningful relation is between past dues and
dues, i.e. principal and interest due and not repaid at the end of the pre-
vious period plus any amount fallen due during the period and not collected
by the end of the period. This ratio was 24.2% as of September 30, 1973
(Table 8). In the absence of precise figures, it is assumed tnat in e
number of banks the ratio may exceed 25%, which is the maximum to be to>-
crated in a sound banking institution. It would be desirable to reduce
arrears overall below 257, but it would be unrealistic to expect this to
happen over a short period of time.  It was, therefore, agreed at negot-at-:-
that this criterion be applied under the proposed project and banks with more
than 25% arrears should not qualify for participation after April 1, 1975, and
after April 1, 1976, this rate would be reduced to 20%. As repayment is
xworst in the medihm  and long termt supervised credit operations, an intensive
and planned loan collection effort should De made to reduce overdues, inr
particular under the first and second CB-IBRD projects, and restructuring
or foreclosure action Lal'en where justified.

36.       Rural banks' repayments to CB.  As of June 30, 1973, arrears
wzith CB totalled P 17.0 million, an increase of P 2.9 million over the
Decer.mber 31, 1972 figures - the largest increase for all hank grotups,
constituting 31.67 of the total banking system's P 53.8 million overdues.
Past dues on account of the second CB-IBRD project amounted to P 1.4 mil-
lion as of October 31, 1973, involving 173 rural banks, of which 137 banks
had accounts overdue for more than 1 year (total P 750,330). The arrears
are a reflection of farmer-borrowers' defaults to rural banks. They are
stil mianageable, but further developments should be closely watched.
CB tries to maintain financial disci 'oline. Rural banks with past due
loans exceeding 25%' of their total outstanding loans neither qualify for
participation under the CB-IBRD project 1/ nor are they eligible for CB
rediscount facilities. 2/  Banks with past due loans from rediscounting
which remain outstanding for more than 30 days are suspended from redis-
counting for a period of at least three months, and if the offense is
repeated within six months, the bank is again disqualified for six months.
Also, rural banks have to pay a penalty of 5% p.a. on overdues. In meri-
torious cases, repayment plans are arranged, requiring rural banks to pay
a certain proportion of the amount due and allowing rescheduling of the
balance. Should the position further deteriorate, CB would have to take
stronger action. A first step would be to improve statistics and report-
ing on repayments.
Profits
37.       Income and expenditure increased substantially in volume over
the last five years (Tables 10 and 11) but net income and return on
capital show a declining trend. Gross operating income totalled P 84.0
million during 1972 against P Nt.7 million in 1971, an increase of 13.9%,
twhich was mainly due to increased Lending. The gross operating expenses
totalled P 61.8 million and P 52.9 million respectively during the same
period; the increase of 16.8% was largely caused by higher salary and
interest payments. The net operating profits consequently were P 22.2
million in 1972 and P 20.8 million in 1971, only 6.6% up.
38.       During the same perind,  -onimon stock increased by 12.3∞ and
preferred stock by 10.6%. This resulted in a reduction of the average
rate of return on stockholders' investment from 8.67D in 1971 to 8.2%4' in
1972, which is not a very attractive return under Philippine conditions.
The net income was 26.4%' of total gross income (28.1% in 1971). In 1972,
net income in percent of average interest earning assets (loan portfolio
plus investments in Government securities) was 3.1% compared with 3.5%
the previous year. All indicators point to reduced income in relation to
1/   An additional requirement for the CB-IBRD project is that past dues
granted under special financing programs may a]so not exceed 25% of
loans outstanding.
2/   For rediscounting purposes, iogns granted to agrarian reform bene-
ficiaries or under AGLF and CB-IBRi) special financing programs are
excluded.

the volume of business and capital invested. Higher profitability could
primarily be achieved by an increase in loan volume, which in many banks
could be handled without increasing operating expenses proportionately.
The proposed project would augment the banks' loan portfolios and, over a
period of eight years, assuming a disbursement period of three years and
an average loan period of five years, would increase the gross income of
all participating banks by an estimated P 58.6 million (US$8.6 million). I/
This would make rural banking financially more attractive to stockholders
and potential investors, and would strengthen the system as a whole and
thus promote lending to rural areas.
1/   Lt is assumed that 907 of project funds would be channelled through
rural banks.

THIRD RURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Stock Saviags and Loan Associations
A. Background, Legal Basis and Organization
1.        Savings and loan associations have now reached the stage in the
Philippines where they are considered an effective instrument for encour-
aging savings especially from small savers. Together with the capital
in the case of stock corporations, such savings can be channeled to pro-
ductive purposes in industry, commerce and agriculture or loaned for home-
building or personal consumption needs of members and the public. The
accumulated funds may also be invested in securities of productive enter-
prises and Government or Government agencies. In the beginning, associa-
tions were formed without proper supervision of their activities and
protection of savers. In 1963, there were 254 non-stock savings and loan
associations which were more of a "borrowers' club" in nature than credit
institutions. Their aggregated resources of about P 30 million were
primarily invested in consumption loans of borrowers with fixed salaries.
Public confidence in them was low as a result of widespread abuses and
mismanagement. Recognizing their important function and to remedy the
situation, Congress passed the Savings .ind Loan Associations Act 1/ on
June 22, 1963, which empowered the Monetary Board of the Central Bank
of the Philippines (Annex 4) to supervise and regulate the activities of
the associations.
2.        The Central Bank (CB), during the initial years of its super-
vision, concentrated on introducing discipline within the system and
setting up minimum standards. Pursuant to the Savings and Loan Associa-
tions Act, detailed Rules and Regulations governing the establishment and
operations of savings and loan associations were issued. These efforts
resulted in the dissolution of all associations operating below standards:
at the end of 1966, the number of non-stock associations was down to 77
with aggregate resources of P 23.5 million. At the same time, the first
four licensed stock savings and loan associations cautiously started
operations.
1/   Full title:  An Act to provide for the regulation of the organization
and operations of savings and loan associations, Republic Act No. 3779
0             of June 22, 1963; amended by Republic Act No. 4378 of June 19, 1965,
and Presidential Decree No. 113 of January 20, 1973.



ANNTEX 6

3.        Co effectively supervise and promote the industry, CB established
the Zepartment of Savings and Loan Associations. In early 1973, it was
merged with the Department of Rural Banks into the Department of Rural
Banks and Savings and Loan Associations (DRBSLA), which is described in
Annex 4, paras 6-8. Details of its organizational structure are shown on
the organization chart attached. It is of considerable advantage that
both proposed lending channels, rural bnnks and SSLAs fall under the same
management with the Associate Director of DRBSLA being directly in charge
of the associations. The audit of association is carried out by the three
divisions of the Supervision and Examination Group IV.  Other supporting
services such as training (Annex 4, paras 14-15) are provided by other
sections of DRESLA. As in the case of rural banks, on-lending and adminis-
tration of project funds would be handled by the Special Financing Group II.
Loan processing would follow the same procedures as applied to rural banks
(Annex 4, paras 9-10) with technicians preparing the Farm and Home Plan
and Loan Teams making the final decision on applications. In the initial
stages CB would have to give special attention to fully familiarize all
participating associations with the procedures and policies of the project.
4.        Only stock savings and loan associations would oualify to
participate under the project. As of October 31, 1973 there were 35 SSLAs
(against 77 non-stock associations) of which 14 were in the Greater Maanila
area; one more was in formation. Seven associations have branches and
anotlher 48 applications for opening branches were under consideration. The
regional distribution of SSLAs and their branches is shown on the attached
map.  The right to open branch offices is an advantage the associations have
over rural banks. The 14 SSLAs operating exclusively in Greater Manila
would not qualify to participate under the project as it is assumed that
they would not lend to agriculture. The others would be eligible only if
they fulfill the same qualifications as rural banks (Annex 5, para 27).
They would follow the same rules and regulations and lending terms, in-
cluding at least 10∞ contribution from their own resources. It is anticipated
that about 20 SSLAs would participate in the project. They would supplement
the rural banking system, increase the area covered by the project, and
introduce some competition to established rural banks. It is estimated
that disbursements by SSLAs would not exceed 10% of project fundS.
-5.       Stock savings and loan associations and non-stock associations
are organized in the Philippine League of Savings and Loan Associations,
Inc. (PEIILSLA) which is the equivalent to the Rural Bankers Association
of the Philippines (Annex 5, para 8). PHILSLA represents its members'
point of view in dealings with CB and Government and maintains public
relations.

Organizations and Management
6.        SSLAs are registered as stock corporations under the Corporation
Law, once CB and the Securities and Exchange Commissioner have approved
their establishment. Opening of a branch office or agency requires a
license from CB. Stock associations are authorized to accept deposits
from, and extend loans to, the general public, whereas non-stock associa-
tions are permitted to do business with members only. Since the effective-
ness of Presidential Decree No. 71 on November 29, 1972, stock associations
are cLassified as banking institutions. However, they do not enjoy the same
privileges as rural banks, such as exemption from taxes and Government fees
and charges (Annex 5, para 6) and neither do they receive Government capital
assistance nor have they access to CB rediscount facilities or special fi-
nancing prograns. Their only sources of funds are their paid-up and accu-
mulated capital, deposits and, to a limited extent, borrowings from CB and
other credit institutions.
7.        Stock savings and loan associations are managed by a board of
directors. At least two thirds of the board must be citizens of the
Philippines and a director must own a minimum of P 5,000 of stock at
par value. The executive officers are the president, vice-president,
manager, cashier and treasurer, who may not be officials or employees
of Government or Government agencies.
Financial Pesources
8.        Capital and Reserves.  The minimum paid-up capital is determined
by the Monetary Board but shall not be less than P 100,000. At present,
it is P 750,000 with an additional P 250,000 for every branch office.
At least 70% of the voting stock must be held by persons of Filipino citi-
zenship. Stock may be issued in the form. of common or preferred stock.
Large associations have as many as 200 stockholders with a minimum share
of P 100 par value. The total paid-up stock capital for all SSLAs was
P 33.4 rmillion as of September 30, 1∞73, which was 25,∞ of total resources. 1/
As of the same date, surplus, reserves and undivided profits were only
P 0.9 million or 0.6%7 of all resources (comparative statement of condition
as of September 30, 1972 and 1973 is attached as Table 1, and, for the years
1968-1972, as Table 2).
1/   The conbined capital accounts of each association shall not be less
than 10% of its total assets (excluding cash on hand; amounts due
from banks, including all deposits with CB; and evidence of indebtedness
of CB, thc Governnment or those fully guaranteed by the Govermnment).



ANNEX 6

9.        Deposits.  The main strength of the associations lies in their
ability to collect funds from stockholders and the public in the form of
savings or time deposits. The interest rates are in line with other
banking institutions: 6% p.a. for savings deposits and for time deposits
6.5% p.a. (180 days), 7% p.a. (270 days) and 8% p.a. (360 and more days).
As of September 30, 1973, savings deposits of all stock associations totalied
P 75.0 million (56% of total resources) and time deposits P 16.3 Million
(12% of total resources). Savings deposits rose by P 27.9 million (59%) and
time deposits by P 4.3 million (36%) during the year, and increased by similar
rates during the previous four years (Tables 1 and 2). Every association
must maintain a reserve against its savings and time deposits equivalent to
6% of the aggregate deposits. At least 20% of the reserve must be held in
cash with CB and the rest in bonds or securities of the Government or its
agencies, provided these are fully guaranteed by the Government. Deposits
shall be insured with the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation. In
addition, the system has its own Liquidity Guarantee Fund which assisted
the associations during the heavy withdrawals during the floods in July/
August 1972 and the run on deposits immediately after the imposition of
martial law in September, 1972.
10.       Borrowings.  The law provides for savings and loan associations
to borrow from CB or, subject to the Monetary Board's approval, rediscount
notes and bills of exchange or other commercial papers at the same interest
rates charged to rural banks. No such authority has been given yet. Under
the proposed project SSLAs would borrow from CB. The associations are per-
mitted by law to borrow up to 20% of total assets (or 30% with special
approval of the Monetary Board) from public lending institutions such as
the DBP, PNB, the Government Service Insurance System, the Social Security
S:rstem, and from private lending institutions as may be approved by the
Monetary Board. Such borrowings are in fact very small.

Agriculture is still of minor importance in lending operations, w1hereas
commercial loans take the largest sh,are of loan approvals and are second
:o iouising in t'le loan portfolio.  SILAs have not had the opportunity to
participate in special financing programs for agricultural development.
lwith participation in the proposed project and further development of the
system, it is expected that their loan portfolio will be more balanced in
favor of agriculture in the future.
12.       Loan Size.  During the period January 1 to September 30, 1973,
17Z of loans granted were below P 1,000 and 36% below P 5,000; only 29%
exceeded P 25,000. Small and large loans were growing fastest, whereas
medium size loans showed a decline (Table 4). Loan sizes as envisaged
under the proposed project fall well within the scope of SSLAs. They
should be determined by the borrower's credit needs, earning capacity,
character and ability to repay rather than on collateral.
13.       Loan Periods.  Stock associations shall accommodate the normal
credit needs of the consuming public, of industry, commerce and agricul-
ture. Therefore, they have primarily provided short term advances for a
maxilmum period of one year.  Under the law, 1/ the maximum period per-mitted
is three years except for loans secured by unencumbered real estate whic>-
may be granted up to 20 years. However, this provision has been amended ky
Presidential Decree during negotiations to enable SSLAs to grant medium term
development loans which makes them eligible to participate under the proposed
project.
14.       Interest Rates.  The associations may charge up to 127 p.a. or
1;' p.m. on loans wholly or partly secured by titled real estate and a
maxirum of 14% p.a. or 1-116% p.m. on loans otherwise secured or without
.       1/   Republic Act No. 3770, Section 5 (a).



ANNEX 6

security. Interest may be collected in advance. Actual rates vary from
9% p.a. to 14% p.a.  During the period January 1 to September ^0, 1973,
3% of all loans granted were at 9%-10.5%, 40% at 1i%-12.5%, and 57% at
rates of 13%-14% per annum (Table 4). Reasonable application and service
fees may be charged as prescribed by the Monetary Board. Interest rates
and fees charged for loans made under the proposed project would have to
be equal to those charged by rural banks.
15.       Securities.  Property accepted as collateral on first mortgage
may be loaned up to 70% of the fair market value. The limit for salary
loans is the borrower's deposit plus four months' salary or regular
income. The association's own stock may not serve as security. During
the period January 1 to September 30, 1973, 34% of all loans granted
were secured by real estate, 7% by deposits, 5% by equipment, 1% by
agricultural crops and livestock and the balance by other collateral
(Table 4). For loans granted under the proposed project, policies and
practices regarding collateral applied by rural banks would equally apply
to SSLAs (Annex 7).
Iavestments
16.       Savings and loan associations may invest their funds in any
sound non-speculative enterprise, zs well as in bonds, securities and
other obligations issued by the Government or its agencies.  However,
total investments in equities must not exceed 25% of the association's
net worth, and equity investment in any single enterprise may not exceed
15% of the association's net worth and should remain a minority holding
in that enterprise, except where the enterprise is not a financial inter-
mediary. Investments in allied enterprises fall under CB control which
may impose additional limitations. Aggregate investments in bonds and
securities are limited to 10%, and those in real estate and improvements
thereon to 5% of total assets. Total investments in Government securities
as of September 30, 1973 amounted to P 7.5 million (5.6% of total resources)
and other investments P 14.0 million (10.5% of total reserves). Details
are shown in Tables 3 and 4.
C. Operational Results
17.       Repayments.  Collections by stock associations as of September 30,
1973 were 98.9% of dues as well as of loan portfolio, which is a good per-
formance (Table 5). Only P 1.0 million was due and not repaid. In justi-
fiable cases, SSLAs may reschedule their loans under the following conditions:
(a) for productive loans, the extension may not exceed half the original
period, provided that 30% of the loan has been paid; a second extension may
be allowed, provided that it does not exceed half the period of the first
extension; (b) loans for medical purposes may be extended by the original
loan period, provided 30% of the loan has been paid; and (c) the extension
of consumer loans shall not exceed half the original period, provided that
50% have been repaid.

18.       Profits.  The net income of the system shows a positive trend
over the last four years (Table 6).  While 1969 closed with a net loss of
P 23,000 and 1970 results showed a marginal profit of E 8,000, net income
in 1971 jumped to P 1.0 million and increased in 1972 by 70% to P 1.7 mil-
lion. The largest items on the income side are interest on commercial loans
(30%) and housing loans (22%); agricultural loans contributed only 6% to
gross income. Interest on deposits constituted 32% of all expenses, fol-
lowed by salaries, allowances, etc. with 31%. For the last two years,
income has grown faster than expenses.
19.       During 1972, paid-up capital increased from P 27.4 million as of
December 31, 1971 by P 2.8 million or 10% to P 30.2 million. The average
return on shareholders' investment Zncreased from 3.7% in 1971 to 5.6% in
1972. The net income in percent of interest and dividend earning assets
(loan portfolio, Government securities and equity investments) was 1.4% and
1.9% respectively for the two years. In terms of gross income, the net
income was 1.4% in 1972 against 1.2% in 1971. Although profitability is
still modest, all indicators show an upward trend. Participation in the
project would support this development. It is envisaged that 10% of proj-
ect funds would be channeled through SSLAs. Their additional gross income
of all participahting associations derived from the incremental loan volume
is estimated at P 6.5 million (US$960,000) over a period of eight years
(assuming a disbursement period of three years and an average loan period
of five years). As in the case of rural banks, it would strengthen the
system and make it more attractive to stockholders, potential investors and
depositors.
20.       Audit.  The Supervision and Examination Group IV of DRBSLA
examines all SSLAs at least once a year, and conducts special examinations
as necessary. In 1972, 31 regular and 11 special examinations were carried
out, which is slightly below the target but still satisfactory. If as a
result of any examination, CB finds that an association is violating any law,
charter or rules and regulations, it may order corrective measures or dis-
continuance of operations, or may even take over possession of assets and
liquidate the association. Such action was taken on a large scale after
CB assumed supervision of savings and loan associations in 1963. In the
first three years, 177 non-stock associations were dissolved or liquidated,
but stock associations have not yet failed as CB supervision also includes
training of personnel and technical assistance. DRBSLA also checks auditing
contracts between stock associations and independent auditors.

Collateral and Agrarian Reform
Progress and Effects of Land Reform
1.        Since the declaratiobn of martial law on September 21, 1972, the
Government has taken more vigc.rous steps to implement the Agrarian Reform
Program. The whole country has been declared under land reform (Presiden-
tial Decree No. 2 of 9/26/72), and by Presidential Decree No. 27 of
October 21, 1972, all private agricultural lands primarily devoted to rice
and corn under share-cropping or lease-tenancy systems ought to be transferred
to the tenant farmer. Tenant farmers are to be deemed owners of a portion
constituting a family-size farm of 5 ha if not irrigated and 3 ha if irri-
gated. Land owners may retain up to 7 ha. The program covers about one
million tenants and an area of about 1.77 million ha. Implementation faces
many difficulties and is being carried out in phases. Priority in the
first phase was given to holdings of 100 ha and above. In the second
phase, land holdings of 50-100 ha were covered, followed by holdings of
24-50 ha. Implementation of the program with respect to holdings of less
than 24 ha has been given last priority due to the large number of land-
owners involved. In this category, only land of absentee landlords who
have other sources of income is being transferred to tenants. As of
December 3, 1973, the following had been accomplished:

Although data were collected in 63 provinces and Land Transfer Certificates
issued in 52 provinces, the program was primarily implemented in Central
Luzon.
2.        Tenant-farmers must become full-fledged members of a farmers'
cooperative (barrio association, see para 4), before they can be issued with
a land title. After having fully complied with this and the other require-
ments of Decree No. 27, the Department of Agrarian Reform will issue an
Emancipation Patent on the basis of an approved survey plan. This author-
izes the Registrar of Deeds to enter a transfer certificate of title. 1/
The Land Transfer Certificate would normally be deposited with the Land
Bank of the Philippines (or other credit institutions financing land trans-
fer or providing finance for development) or with the barrio association
that guarantees the amortizations of the new owner, until the previous
1/   The registration procedures are set out in Presidential Decree No. 266,
"Providing for the Mechanics of Registration of Ownership and/or Title
to Land under Presidential Decree No. 27", issued on August 4, 1973.

owner is paid the full compensation as provided in Decree No. 27. 1/ Land
acquired under the land reform program can only be transferred by hereditary
succession or to the Government (Decree No. 27). In addition, the eviction
of tenants from their farms has been prohibited 2/ pending the promulgation
of the rules and regulations implementing Decree No. 27. This has virtually
stopped all ordinary transactions in lard affected by the reform.  Titles
of such land held by rural banks or other lending institutions as securities
for loans lost their collateral value as there ceased to be a free real
estate market on which the property could be sold in case of default. Con-
sequently, banks became reluctant to grant or stopped granting medium and
long term loans to applicants whose land is tenanted rice and corn land or
covered by a lease contract. This restricts lending, particularly to small
operators, who are unable to provide other collateral. As credit for agri-
cultural development is an essential part of the Agrarian Reform Program,
it was ruled by Presidential Decree No. 315 of October 22, 1973 that, "All
financing institutions shall hereafter accept as collateral for loans any
duly registered Land Transfer Certificate issued by the Government, through
the Department of Agrarian Reform, to tenant-farmers in an amount not less
than sixty percent (60%) of the value of the farm holding as determined
under Presidential Decree No. 27; provided, that such loans shall be guar-
anteed by the Guarantee Fund established by the Samahang Nayon (Barrio
Association) in which a tenant-farmer is a full-fledged member, ..." It
is not yet known whether this ruling has had the desired effect, as it is
still unclear what value the Land Transfer Certificate will have if it were
to be realized in case of default. It could have a price as a right to the
land it represents and would accumulate a value once amortization payments
have started. But as a free transfer is excluded, and it is not expected
that Government or the cooperative would take over the farm, eviction of
the tenant would be required first, which might be difficult to enforce
and basically defeat the object of the land reform. It appears, therefore,
that a guarantee coverage would be required to substitute the collateral
value of the land.
Guarantees by Cooperative Organizations
4.        Presidential Decree No. 175 of April 14, 1973 regulates the
strengthening of the cooperative movement which has been assigned a vital
role in the implementation of the Agrarian Reform Program. The basis of
the system is the Samahang Nayon or Barrio Association which has a
1/   Presidential Decree No. 27 of October 21, 1972, stipulates that the
value of the land shall be equivalent to two and one half (2-1/2)
times the average harvest of three normal crop years immediately
preceding the promulgation of the decree.  The total cost of the land,
including interest at the rate of 6% p.a. shall be paid by the tenant
in 15 equal annual installments.

provisional status of a cooperative. 1/ It is established at barrio (vil-
lage) level and serves the requirements of Presidential Decree No. 27. Any
tenant-farmer who wishes to become a land owner has to become a member. In
case of his default in an amortization payment for the land, the barrio
association which has a right of recourse against the member could be called
upon to pay in lieu of the defaulter. For this purpose, the barrio associa-
tion establishes a Barrio Guarantee Fund to which all members have to con-
tribute a minimum of one cavan of palay per ha per harvest or its equivalent
(present support price is P 35). The Barrio Guarantee Fund may, among other
things, be used to guarantee members' loans from credit institutions and to
pay for the premiums of a life insurance policy covering all members.
5.        In addition, the barrio association accumulates funds in the
Barrio Savings Fund from a compulsory deduction of 5% from all production
loans granted by any authorized lending institution at the time of loan
release, or a minimum of P 5 per month from members who do not seek or
obtain loans. Other income is derived from a P 10 membership fee and a
commission on collections of past due loans granted by the Agricultural
Credit and Cooperative Finan:zing Administration and ACA. 2/ The funds of
the barrio association can also be used to capitalize full-fledged coopera-
tives, to purchase shares of stocks of and/or to capitalize rural banks and
development banks, and for other purposes as authorized by the Department
of Local Government and Community Development (DLGCD). The movement is
expanding rapidly. As of November 5, 1973 a total of 5,277 barrio asso-
ciations were formed with a membership of more than 268,000 farmers. The
target is to organize one million farmers by June 1974. The funds of the
cooperative organizations are expected to be substantial. If an average
savings of P 100 per member per year are assumed, total funds of all
barrio associations may accumulate at an annual rate of P 100 million
after successfully reaching the target of one million farmers.
6.        Also by Presidential Decree No. 175, the Cooperative Development
Loan Fund has been established. It will be financed from general appro-
priations, proceeds of sales of US PL 480 commodities, levies on agricul-
tural commodities and other sources. This Fund shall be utilized for the
following purposes:  (a) source of loanable funds to cooperatives; (b)
serve as a guarantee for loans granted to cooperatives; and (c) source

no case shall any portion of this Fund be utilized for direct loans to
farmer members. It will be administered by a management committee composed
of a representative of DLGCD who shall serve as chairman, a representative
of CB, PNB, the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the
Department of Agrarian Reform and two representatives of the Cooperative
movement designated by the Secretary of DLGCD. If established and suffi-
ciently funded, the Cooperative Development Loan Fund would be a valuable
component in the system of guarantees built into the cooperative movement
and would serve as an additional safeguard to rural banks' lending to land
reform beneficiaries.
Guarantee Funds
7.        With the introduction of supervised credit, the normal require-
ment of colalteral to be provided by borrowers appeared to be of less
importance than before. However, as lenders cannot be expected to bear
the full risk, Government established guarantee funds to back up lending
secured only by a lien over the crop to be produced with the loan. The
Agricultural Guarantee and Loan Fund (AGLF) was created in 1966, which
provided funds through CB to rural banks for on-lending to farmers and
cooperatives under a concept of supervised credit and protected participat-
ing banks from losses to the extent of 70% of the loans granted at a fee of
1% of the loan amount. AGLF not only guaranteed short term production loans
but also medium and long term development loans, including the Government
counterpart contribution under the first and second CB-IBRD projects. AGLF
was phased out in early 1972 and integrated in the Agricultural Guarantee
Fund (AGF) which was created by a special act. 1/ Losses from supervised
short term production loans (up to P 5,000) to agrarian reform beneficiaries
with a maximum of 6 ha of land were guaranteed up to 70% of the loan amount
against a fee of 1% payable by the lending institution. In August 1972,
the Central Bank Loan and Guarantee Fund (popularly known as the Calamity
Fund) was established, to provide funds for and guarantee short term
agricultural production loans through rural banks principally to farmers
of Central and Southern Luzon who suffered from the 1972 floods. The
guarantee covered 85% of credit losses under supervised credit (fee 1% of
loan amount) and 50% of non-supervised credit (fee 1.5% of loan amount).
8.        Those three guarantee funds have been integrated into the
Agrarian Reform Fund (ARF) created under Presidential Decree No. 85 of
December 25, 1972. The ARF was established to finance the land transfer
operations, guarantee payment to the former land owners and provide finance
and guarantees for agricultural production or commodity loans. The rules

ANNEX 7

and regulations issued by the ARF Commission covering the ARF are basically
the same as those for the AGF. This implies that the fund guarantees only
short term supervised production loans up to 85% of the loan. All possible
losses of rural banks, PNB and ACA under the "Masagana 99" program are
covered by ARF guarantee, but not the CB-IBRD program.
9.        Presidential Decree No. 251 of July 21, 1973, revitalizing the
Land Bank of the Philippines directs that all agricultural guarantee funds
shall be converted into a trust fund to be administered by the Land Bank.
The transfer has not taken place yet, as the Land Bank does not presently
have the necessary administrative capacity.
10.       The availability of sufficient and acceptable collateral has also
been a constraint in lending to small fishermen. Therefore, the Small
Fishermen's Special Credit Fund (SFSCF) was created by the Monetary Board
in April 1971. It was funded with P 2 million from the National Food and
Agriculture Council AGLF budgetary appropriation and intended for loans to
the fishing industry along Manila Bay and guarantees to the lending insti-
tutions granting those loans. Qualified fishermen with boats not exceed-
ing 3 tons gross were eligible for loans up to P 5,000 for fishing boats,
motors and fishing gear for a period of three years. Technical assistance
was provided by fisheries technicians. Loans were to be secured by real
estate, if available, a chattel mortgage on the items to be financed and
two acceptable co-makers. The borrower had to be a member of a fishermen's
cooperative through which the catch had to be marketed and 30% of the
proceeds collected every fishing day as repayment of the loan and interest.
The SFSCF guaranteed 80% of the loan outstanding.  Although SFSCF filled
a genuine need and was well designed, disbursements could not be completed
and the pilot project failed mainly due to inadequacies in the cooperative
society and misappropriation of collections.
Conclusions
11.       Farmer-borrowers of rural banks and SSLAs not affected by land
reform are expected to continue providing collateral primarily in the form
of real estate mortgage. There was an increasing trend to take real estate
mortgage as collateral and a declining proportion of unsecured loans by rural
banks until 1971 (see Table attached). It is hoped that this trend conti-
nues to reverse and lending institutions be less conservative on collateral
requirements and rely more on the character of the borrower known from past
performance, his repayment capacity and would accept chattel mortgages over
the items to be financed. The proposed simplified loan processing procedures
for small loans (Annex 4, para 10), under which a real estate mortgage should
not be required, will hopefully find widespread acceptance.
12.       Where lending institutions insist on a real estate mortgage,
valuation methods should be changed to reflect more realistic values.
Currently, the appraised value is being computed by adding the value as
assessed by the tax authorities (which for obvious reasons is kept as low
as possible) to the market value estimated by the rural bank inspector
and CB field staff and dividing the sum by two. This value is generally



ANNEX 7
W                                                                         Page  7
less than half of the fair market value.  The maximum loan amount granted
is 701% of this computed value for titled properties and 50% for untitled
properties. This method has been discriminatory, especially to small
farmers with limited securities. It does not sufficiently take into account
the increase in property values or increases in prices of the items to be
financed. Therefore, as proposed by CB, under the Third Rural Credit Proj-
ect, real estate should be appraised on the basis of fair market values as
estimated bv the rural bank or SSLAs and the CB technician, and reviewed by
the Loan Team. The loan values would remain at 70% of titled and 50% of
untitled property.
13.       Loans to beneficiaries of land reform who cannot provide colla-
teral comparable to free-hold title fully acceptable to the lending insti-
tutions should be underwritten by a guarantee. As shown above, the Barrio
Guarantee Fund and other resources of the barrio association as well as
the Cooperative Development Loan Fund in case loans are granted to coopera-
tives, could provide such guarantees.  However, the revived cooperative
movement has not had the chance yet to prove to be effective. In view of
its equivocal history it is considered advisable not to expect cooperative
guarartees to be unquestionably acceptable to the banks.  The current policies
governing ATRF do not permit g;iaranteeing medium and long term development
loans. It is, thlerefore, con;idered necessary for the success of the pro-
posed project to extend ARF guarantees to also cover loans to beneficiaries
of the lancd reform program under the proposed project. This has been
agreed during negotiations.
14.       The availability of adequate collateral acceptable to lending
institutions is also expected to be a lending constraint for fishery loans
under the project. Therefore, Government should provide a guarantee to
the extent of 85% of the sub-loans to participating lending institutions
on terms and conditions similar to those developed for SFSCF, but adjusted
to thie project.

PHILIPPINES
THIRD RURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Farm Mechanization
A. Introduction
1.        The Third Rural Credit Project proposes to finance 1,771 four-
wheel tractors and 1,000 domestically manufactured power tillers - by
far the largest component (53% of the total) of the six major investment
categories proposed. The number of four-wheel tractors and the number of
power tillers envisaged are each about 30% larger than those financed (as
of the end of October 1973) by the on-going Second Rural Credit Project.
2.        The financing is warranted and consistent with the national goals
set for agricultural development. The Philippines is committed to self-
sufficiency in rice and corn, and also to the increase of sugar production,
one of its major sources of foreign exchange earnings. Reaching self-
sufficiency in cereals is important not only on balance of payments con-
siderations, but also as an instrument for increasing incomes in rural areas.
Viewed in this context, mechanization of Philippine agriculture is a logical
accompaniment to efforts aimed at increasing the intensity of cultivation -
the spread of irrigation, the increased application of fertilizers, and
insecticides and the dissemination of (disease resistant) high yielding
varieties (HYV) of rice and corn. Mechanization is also a necessary condi-
tion for the raising of yields in the sugar sector, and the extension of
cultivation to areas which remain to be developed, particularly in the
Cagayan and Mindanao. The considerable financial benefits accruing to
owner operators as well as to those who hire tractor services are of course
the main impetus to mechanization, but the progress of mechanization, by
encouraging cropping intensity and extensive cultivation, is also likely to
raise wage income and thus to contribute to the economic advancement of
farm labor. The available data on the rice sector reveals that farm mecha-
nization normally accompanies the introduction of HYVs, and this combina-
tion entails an increased labor input per unit of land. Setting aside purely
financial considerations, mechanization performs well from the economic point
of view - the estimated economic rates of return for both four wheel tractors
and power tillers are well over 100% (Annex 21).
B. The Status of Mechanization
3.        The Third Rural Credit Project would contribute towards the
enlargement of the existing fleet of four-wheel tractors from 11,033 in
December 1973 to about 13,500 by the end of 1977; and that of power tillers



ANNEX 8
Page  2
from 12,986 in December 1973 to over 50,000 by the end of 1977 (Table 1-3
and Charts WB 8399, WB 8450, WB 8451). The four-wheel tractor park has in-
creased at a rate of 4% per annum over the past 10 years, and no significant
departure from the trend is forecast. Power tiller sales, on the other hand,
have been subject to large fluctuations over recent years. However, with
the commencement and gradual strengthening of local production there has
been a dramatic increase in power ttller sales - a trend which is expected
to continue and to more than double the power tiller park by 1974.
4.        The pace of mechanization has been a function of the varying
patterns of growth in the three major agricultural sectors: rice, corn
and sugar. Prior to 1960, agricultural growth could be attributed largely
to land expansion. In the 1960's this pattern continued in the Philippine
sugar economy; though yields actually declined, acreage under sugar cane
expanded to meet growing domestic and export demands. The boom in tractor
sales between 1962 and 1964 appears to have been related to the boom in
the sugar industry which followed the US embargo on Cuban imports 1/. Simi-
larly extensions of corn acreage which resumed, after a period of decline
in 1964-65, contributed to tractor purchases in the corn areas of Mindanao,
the Visayas and Cagayan 2/.
S.        Developments in the rice sector have been totally different.
Intensive, rather than extensive, cultivation has been the pattern since
1960. Growth in total rice output in the 1960's has resulted from a
combination of two factors, an increase in the area double cropped and an
increase in the yield per hectare per crop, supported by the extension
of irrigation. The spread of the HYVs and increases in yields have been
more extensive in the irrigated than in the rain-fed areas. As yield
improvements occurred resulting from the use of HYV and double-cropping
the peak demand, as well as the total demand for labor increased and tractor
mechanization shifted towards rice. By 1967, 41% of tractor buyers were
rice farmers. Tractor purchase, which had been sustained in the early 1960's
by the acreage extensions in sugar and corn, increased from 1966, as rice
yields improved, to average about 1,500 tractors per annum in the three year
period 1967-69. The following table summarizes the relative contribution
of area and yield to total growth in the production of rice, corn and sugar
between 1948-50 and 1967/69 (see also Table 4) 3/.
1t Tractor concentration in the Western Visayas and Pampanga in Luzon -
the main sugar producing areas in the Philippines already accounted
for about 35% of the total national tractor pool, by 1960.
2/ The dissemination of disease-resistant varieties since 1970-71 is
likely, however, to so improve yields that acreage extension will
not be necessary for the attainment of self-sufficiency in corn.
3/   Table 4 presents the data on expansions of harvest area under rice,
corn and sugar. Increases in the harvest area for rice reflect not
only acreage extension in the early years but also the increase in
cropping intensity made possible by irrigation.

C. Need foo Pro_oed Mechanization
6.        The need for a mechznization programme arises out of the three
major goals of Philippine agriculture: (a) the adoption of intensive
cultivation, particularly in view of the avowed national goal of attaining
self-sufficiency in rice; (b) improvements in yield, which will require the
tightening of operation schedules in sugar; and (c) extensions of acreage
in previously undeveloped agricultural areas. The primary reasons making
for profitability of mechanization, at the farm level, were spelt out during
interviews with farmer borrowers, as follows:
(a) In the process of intensifying and extending farming
operations, mechanization relieves energy constraints
to production by promoting timeliness, especially
because yield increasing inputs such as high-yielding
varieties (HYV), and fertilizer, combined with multiple
cropping, increase overall and peak labor and energy
requirements;
(b) In sugar cane and upland crop cultivation, mechanization
enhances yields per crop by facilitating deep ploughing
and ripping, incorporating crop residue into the
soil, and as by providing better weed control;
(c) Carabaos are difficult to handle and care for as
cultivation is intensified, and work load increases,
and there is less land available for maintenance of
animals. It is more advantageous to use tractor custom
(hire) service than to purchase additional animals
(costing ) 1,500 to Y 2,000 per head);



ANNEX 8
Page  4                 I
(d) Land preparation is traditionally a family labor job.
In irrigated multiple crop areas mechanization, by
relieving the farmer of the need to devote all family
labor exclusively to land preparation, allows him to
undertake harvesting, threshing, land preparation,
sowing and weeding operations on different plots simul-
taneously - a practice which helps reduce on-farm losses
from unpredictable rains, and allows the farmer to keep
within the planting calendar. Thus mechanization of
land preparation allows a more rational and productive
use of family and hired labor. Mechanization provides more
time for family members to engage in the backyard livestock
projects, suggested as a component of the proposed project.
This will also promote a fuller utilization of family
labor; and
(e) Threshing and drying equipment are essential to reduce
on-farm losses and facilitate multiple cropping.
The Spread of Intensive Cultivation
7.        Intensification of agricultural operations, especially in rice,
hinges on two factors: the spread of irrigation, and the adoption of the
HYV package. Irrigation projections covering 1972-1980 forecast on an ex-
pansion of the irrigated crop area from around 884,000 ha to about 1,528,000
ha. HYV use is targeted to increase along with this increase in irrigated
area and to cover an extra 783,000 acres of rainfed land between 1972 and
1980 1/. The adoption of tractor technology is closely related to avail-
ability of irrigation and HYV use. Increases in cropping intensity raise
energy requirements in rice production - and also emphasize the importance
of timeliness in cultivation where farmers grow two or more crops a year.
(The time element is of course also important for some rain-fed crops.)
8.        The energy constraint (and hence timeliness) is an increasingly
important issue. This is evident from the three IRRI surveys on the effects
of the new HYV technology and mechanization in the Philippine rice sector:
(a) the Central Luzon-Laguna Survey which covered three crop cycles:
1966-67, and the 1968-70 wet seasons; (b) the Laguna Survey conducted in
the wet seasons, 1969 to 1970; and (c) the Gapan Survey conducted in the
wet season of 1970. About 44% of the tractor users in the Laguna Survey
indicated that mechanized cultivation saves time in land preparation, the
reasons cited being that carabao care and maintenance were becoming
increasingly difficult, and that tractors can work continuously while
carabao cannot. About 60% of the respondents in the Laguna Survey pointed
1/   IBRD, Agricultural Sector Survey, Philippines Vol. III, Annex 6,
Tables 16A, 18, Report No. 39a-PH, May 2, 1973.



ANNEX 8
Page 5
out that carabao rustling was a growing problem which can be attributed to
the fact that carabao prices are increasing and that carabao slaughter
restrictions have been lifted.
9.        Timeliness is important in those irrigation areas where block
water control is practised by the irrigation authorities, and water is
available to each block for specific times only. Harvesting, seedbed
preparation and cultivation operations must then be compressed into a
limited period, and the manpower and energy requirements may actually strain
the labor and carabao capacities available. This is particularly true
in areas where carabao availabilities are just sufficient for traditional
cultivation practices, and where newly introduced improved methods require
greater energy expenditure for land preparation, planting, weeding and
harvesting 1/.
10.       A closer look at specific irrigation project areas indicates
that, as the intensity of cultivation is stepped up, particular areas
may experience carabao and/or labor bottlerecks in the peak seasons. The
estimates of labor and animal requirements and availabilities cited here
are intended to suggest the likelihood of such shortages rather than to
convey an idea of the magnitudes, since labor and working carabao population
figures are generally unavailable by irrigation project area, and have been
derived by interpolation from regional and provincial totals 2/. Another
caveat is that the patterns of cropping intensity postulated for these irri-
gation project areas are certainly not the norm, across Philippine rice agri-
culture. Consequently, the farm models on which the financial and economic
justification of the mechanization component of the Third Rural Credit Proj-
ect rest, posit a much more modest 15% increase over the estimated average
cropping intensity of 150. This improvement in cropping practices would be
well within the reach of the project's beneficiaries and of those farmers
who hire out tractor services.
11.       A detailed examination of the Upper Pampanga River Irrigation
Project (UPRP) may help to spell out the rationale underlying mechanization
in the rice sector. The UPRP comprises 77,800 ha in Nueva Ecija in Central
Luzon. Prior to development about 70,800 ha grew a single crop of palay
and only 7,000 ha were irrigated and planted in the dry season. After the
completion of the irrigation scheme targeted for 1975, 72,000 ha would pro-
duce two crops a year and only 5,800 ha would be sown with one crop per
annum. This would imply an increase in cropping intensity of about 77%,
from 1.09% before the development to 193% afterwards.
1/   In a cross-country comparison of human, animal and mechanical power
availabilities per hectare, the Philippines ranks very low in the
a                scale - see Table 5.-
2/   Estimates of labor force in agriculture are overstated because they
include labor engaged in forestry, fishing and hunting.



ANNEX 8
Page  6
12.       Nueva Ecija has a labor-land ratio of about .421 men per hectare
and a carabao availability of about 1 animal per hectare. In those areas
ol Nueva Ecija where RYV use is prevalent (and the UPRP calendar is con-
sidered the norm), the peak period labor and carabao requirements work out
to about 1 man-day and about .89 carabao per hectare per day, far in excess
of the availabilities. In practice, region-wide labor bottlenecks have
not been experienced because farmerts across the province did not engage
in simultaneous land preparation, planting or harvest. Secondly, labor
has not been totally immobile across contiguous barrios in Nueva Ecija.
The farm population has also drawn on the province's reserves of working
age population who are either outside the labor force or unemployed. Never-
theless, irrigated double-cropped farm areas are experiencing localized labor
shortages at critical periods as cropping intensity is increased, especially
where the UPRP crop calendar is being enforced 1/.
13.       A similar exercise has been conducted for five other irrigation
project areas. Labor requirements per hectare have become a constraint
where block irrigation is practiced in Angat, Magat, Magsaysay and Aurora
Penaranda. Carabao shortages are common in Magsaysay and Aurora Penaranda
and the problem may even surface in Angat and Magat under certain cropping
systems. See Table 6. 2/
Improvements in Yields
14.       Yield increases are targeted for corn and sugar through the
dissemination of disease-resistant HYVs of corn, and improvements in deep-
tillage and timing for sugar cultivation. Problems associated with low
sugar recovery have been: (a) an extended milling season which reduced
sugar content, (b) under-supply of cane to the mills causing a delay in
milling while stocks were built up for a run causing deterioration, and
(c) deterioration by over-supply and dumping while the cane awaited milling.
The crop cycle has been thrown out of gear with respect to the annual
weather cycle; land preparation has been delayed by the use of carabao,
resulting in poor growth or harvesting of immature cane. For the whole
of the W. Visayas there is only 1 working carabao for every 1.67 ha under
rice, sugar and corn. The carabao shortages will increase because the
W. Visayas and Central Luzon will lose draft carabao to carabeef production.
1/   The UPRP has two features making for labor and carabao shortages.
Canal maintenance requires two months so that the double crop cycle
has to be confined to ten months each year. Second, block irrigation
which imposes a uniform cropping calendar, reduces labor mobility even
across neighboring blocks.
2/   The carabao shortage is likely to worsen.  Slaughter rates are increas-           J
ing faster than carabao numbers. In Central Luzon carabao slaughter
rates showed a six-fold increase in 1972-73 over the previous year.



Page  7
Slaughter rates of carabao in thiis region in 1972-73 increased to twenty
times the average for previous years resulting in an 8.8% depopulation of
carabao for the region, from 710,000 in 1972 to 647,700 in 1973.
15.       Thus both the carabao shortage and the exigencies of deep-tillage
and timing in sugar production and recovery, have contributed to the adoption
oi tractor teclnology (and truck transport for cane haulage) 1/,
The Potential for Extensive Cultivation
16.       One of the major roles fulfilled by mechanization, especially
in Mindanao, has been the extension of cultivation to previously uncultivated
lands. The land reserves of the Philippines are now limited to about 1.0-
1.5 million ha of unused cultivable land. A further 1.0 millon ha of cogon
grasslands are available but at present these areas present problems of
rehabilitation. Most of these potentially productive areas are situated in
the Cagayan Valley, Mindanao and Palawan. It has been estimated that
500,000 ha are available in Mindanao. Mindanao also has a further potential
of 350,000 ha for irrigation and ext-ensive areas suitable for more intensive
cultivation. In the Cagayan Valley, development can bring about 100,000 ha
under irrigation,
17.       The main method used for developing land reserves has been
migration from heavily populated areas. The government has in progress
24 resettlement projects covering about 500,000 ha, of which 8 are in Luzon,
3 in Visayas and 13 in Mindanao; the "Palayan ng Bayan" program plans to
bring under cultivation 131,600 ha of virgin land.
18.       Unorganized extension of crop area into unpopulated regions
involves a slash-and-burn approach to land clearing implying a lapse of
some years before the land reaches full production.  The problem of secondary
regrowth associated with this system has been recognized by the Davao del
Norte Irrigation Project.  Ttventy 70 BlP tractor units have been allotted to
the 12,000 ha project to handle reclamation of second-growth forest. In
addition, the low carabao population of the area (about 1 beast per 4 farms)
is to be supplemented with 15C two-wheel tractors of 6-10 BHP.
19.       The cogon grasslands have thus far been avoided by farmers as the
native plow cannot operate in these areas. Thus vast areas wihich might
otherwise have been pressed into production have lain idle. The reclamation
of these cogon grasslands, a process which requires nechanized clearing, may
,; come necessary in order to provide land and employent to new entrants into
f-le rural labor force.  The DANR estimates that in 1973 the acreage tuder
-orn increased appreciably  _a  incaanao, with the help of mechanization. The
potential for further acreage extensions if necessary remains enormous.
1/   If -ae Jertilizer crisis deepens, tractors may be needed again for
acreage extensions i: satgar.

D. Financial and Economic Viability of Investment
in Tractors
20.       Analyses of the economics of rice production under irrigation and
HYV use with land preparation carried out by four wheel tractor and power
tiller in farms of 15 ha and 3 ha in size respectively, show that even
assuming a 15% increase in cropping intensity (from 150% to 172.5%) I/
investments in four-wheel tractors and power tillers yield a financial
rate of return of 47.3% and 21.0% respectively 2/.  The farm models set
out in Annex 19 assume that the farmer-beneficiaries undertake custom work.
The hours of annual usage are very liberal and perhaps exceed the general
average, but they are well within the realm of possibility with efficient
management. 3/ Moreover, the extent of custom use assumed is in line with
observed trends in the Philippines (68% of the four-wheel tractor owners
are combined farmer - custom service operators: only 18% use their tractors
solely for their own farms).
21.       In sugar cane production the estimated financial rate of return
on investment in the four-wheel tractor is 45.5%.
22.       The corresponding rate for the power tiller rises in corn pro-
duction to 33.9%, assuming that cultivation is extended from 2 to 3 ha,
that yield per ha rises from 60 to 65 cavans/ha and that cropping intensity
rises from 150% to 165%.
23.       Estimates of the economic gains of tractorization in rice, corn
and sugar place the economic rates of return on four-wheel tractors and
power tillers at well over 10)%.
24.       The project proposes to exclude financing of tractors with horse-
power in excess of 80 BEP since the efficiency of the tractor depends
primarily on the size of the implements used rather than on the motive power
available. In rice production four-wheel tractors are used mainly for rotavat-
ing which requires a constant low speed of about 3-6 km/hour, regardless of
the size of the power unit. Philippine farmers generally use a 50-60 inch
rotavator with tractors ranging from 45-80 BHP, and obtain little or no
increase in capacity with the increase in tractor HP class. It is only in
extensive upland (rainfed) agriculture that it is possible to increase out-
put by increasing ground speed (with the same size of implements); however,
on small plots and in paddy conditions, this is not practical or possible.
1i   Yield and cropping intensity levels assumed are lower than the levels
targeted in the irrigatoan project areas which will be the primary
loci of tractor cultivation.

Relative Prices
25.       The primary reason for such high rates of return and for the grow-
ing demand for tractors lies not so much in the increases in yield, cropping
intensity, or custom rates positulated in the estimates, but in the high and
rising price trends for the three major Philippine crops. Indeed, the
argument put forward by the critics of the mechanization program, namely,
that government policies have worked in favor of tractorization and against
labor in the Philippines has overlooked a most important price signal. The
argument has run solely in terms of the relative factor price configuration,
instead of taking cognizance of the influence of high product prices on the
adoption of new farm technology.
26.       The rising trend in prices not only encouraged the farmers to
adopt new technology in the form of HYVs, fertilizer and intensive cultiva-
tion practices to enable him to take advantage of the high returns to agri-
cultural production, but by raising farm incomes induced him to opt for
tractor technology as well. The concurrent rise in tractor custom rates
(by a factor of as much as 2-2.5 between early 1968 and late 1973) only
raised total operating costs by about 4-5%, whereas returns from rice,
sugar and corn rose by very much more. Between 1969 and December 1973,
the price of a cavan of paddy increased by 124% from ? 15,6 to f 33.5,
the price of sugar cane by 126% from 1 30 per picul to 1 68, and the price
of corn by 66%, from t 15 per cavan to 0 25. Higher custom rates for
tractorized land cultivation also encouraged tractor ownership by holding
out the promise of increased supplemental incomes.
27.       Further, there has been no long consistent factor price trend
favoring the substitution of tractors for human labor or even carabao.
The price indices for durable equipment, tractors and work animals have
been plotted in Chart WB 8547 1/. The devaluation of the peso between
1959 and 1962, caused a rapid rise in the price of machinery, and a con-
sequent decline in tractor imports. Between 1963 and 1965, there was a
fall in the tractor price index, and a rise in the cost of work animals
and farm wages. Later the minimum wage was also increased. This was the
period of the large tractor sales to the sugar industry and the period
of corn acreage extensions in Mindanao. By the time the First Rural Credir
Project program began, the tractor price index had risen again outstrippit,,g.
the rate of rise of the price of work animals and wages.  Tractor pri,.^
levelled between 1967 and 1968. From 1969 onwards, there has been a rising
trend in all prices. Though the tractor price index series is not avail-
able beyond 1968, a comparison of average 65 BHP four-wheel tractor prices

between 1969 and October 1&73 reeals a 230% increase 1/, farm wages (for
transplanting, weeding) durilng the sa-me period appear to have risen by
about 225%.  Carabao prices ova the other hand appear to liave risen by
about 450-500% during the same period.  The Agricultural Machinery Dealer's
Association applied in December 1973 to the Central Banlk for a 15% increase
in prices. Indications are that this price increase is likely to be grantsed.
28.       Thus the effects of the relative factor price trerds are by no
means consistent or unambiguous.  The more recent rise in carabsao prices,
stemming partially from a growing feeling about carabao scarcity, may
indeed have induced the substitution of the tractor for the traditional
work animal, but Philippine agricultural mechanization is not a threat
to the use of the carabao.  The typical tractorized farm usually maintains
one or two animals. Further the large imDending rise in tractor prices
will ensure that relative prices do not militate against the use of labor0
E. Employment and Socio-Economic Considerations
Effects on Employment
29.       Evidence on the effects of mechanization on employment is avail-
able only for the rice sector, from the farm surveys conducted by IRRI in
Central Luzo.i, Laguna, and Nueva Eciia. The level of mechanization is
found to vary with the level of irrigation and the adoption of the new
technology in rice 2/.  There are four major labor use activities in rice
production: land preparation, transplanting, weeding, and harvesting and
threshing.  The survey results show that there have been changes in labor
requirements in all of these areas.
30.       Land preparation requires s'rkill, is heavy work, and is performed
by the male members of the familv. The Johnson-0uintana-Johnson
study of the mechanization of rice production in Central Luzon poiTnts out
that only in one farm operation - land preparation - did farmers complain
about labor shortages. Hired labor was difficult to come by for plowing
and harrowing. It is no wonaer tnen that the IR.RI surveys highlight the
association between irrigation and tractor use where irrigated (HYV) double
1/   The adoption of the floating exch,ange rate in 1970 resulted in a sharp
decline in tractor imports.
2/   See Charts 8548, 8591,  The rate cf increase (1967-1968) in wet season
tractor use appears tc be greatest in the rjinfed areas.  One possible
explanation may lie in the fact th.at, in rainfed areas) as in some
irrigated areas) the normal shortage of labor for plowing and harrowing
is accentuated by the prac tice of -antire barrio communities performing
farming operations simultaieously.

cropping raises the pea'k demand :or labor for plowing and harrowing, and
also accommodates tractor purcase ,y increas ing incomes. 1/
31.       Thus as irrigatio. end  >-IV use increased between 1966 and 1970,
tractor users in Central LuzoBL_a¢.una increased from 14% to 48% of farm
households surveyed; the La    Sirvey showed an even greatar increase from
37 to 76%. In another survey of 42 farms planti.ng H-YVs in 1969 in Laguna,
Barker and Cordova 2/ found that tractor use had risen from 31% to 62%
between 1966 and 1969. All three studies found that e:ve  though total and
family labor engaged per crop for land preparation dec inw7the albsoute
niUmber of man-days hired remained constant at 4 aii-da;s in Luzon, and at
about 2 man-days in Central Luzon-Laguna (when the data aii_di4ided i-ito
tractor users and non-users) or even increased as in th-e Barker Cordova
study, by as much as 5 man-days (see Tab]es 7-9).  Wheni mechanization
induces increases in cropping intensity the result may be a more notice-
able increase in labor hired for land preparation.
32.       The more significant conclusion is that, with the simultaneous
introduction of HYVs and tractor technology, there has been a considerable
increase in the overall input of hired labor.  Even though the total
man-days required per hectare over one crop cycle have only risen by 6.4%
(63 man-days in 1966 vs 67 in .970 in Central Luzon-Laguna), the hired
labor input has risen by 10.8% (4 man-days) in Central Luzon-Laguna, by
18.8%  (9 man-days) in Luzon, and by 86.1% (31 -man-days) in the Barker-
Cordova study. The effect of an increase in cropping iritensity on total
labor employed and the hired labor input is appreciable.  Tractor users
in Central Luzon-Laguna who cultivate 1.725 crops per year carn expect to
devote an additional 9.5 man-days overall, and to hire an extra 38 man-days
per hectare, compared to non-users who achieve a cropping intensity of 150%.
33.       The rise in total and hired labor use per hectare per crop is a
reflection of the change in the distribution of labor among specific cul-
tivation tasks. The drop in the share of labor required for land cultiva-
Lion from 27% to 15% on 76 farms in Central Luzon-Laguna, has been accom-
modated by a rise in the percentage share of labor engaged in weeding from
8% to 17%. The share of labor for harvesting and threshing has also in-
creased (see Chart WB 8546).
1/   The proposed Introduction of dry-seeding on 50,000 ha of rainfed rice
land during the 1974 season, will. require the use of tractors for the
dry plowing operations since the native plow carnnot penetrate most dry
paddy soils. Also turn-around time between the dry-seeded crop to be
planted and harvested between April/May and July/September and the
regular wet season crop will need to be minimized, again necessitating
mechanized land preparation.

34.       Thus the diffusion of HYVs has had two direct effects on labor
use.  The upwara shift in the production function has created an incentive
to intensify labor input for crop care, and it has increased the demand
for harvest and post-harvest labor. With the extension of irrigation, and
the adoption of double cropping in particular areas, labor for land-
cultivation, not merely labor for weeding, harvest and threshing, may
increase. In any event the total labor Input per hectare of land might
be expected to increase significantly wi;:h a 200% irrigation efficiency.
35.       The end-result for total labor employed would of course depend
on the nature and extent of mechanization of the weeding, harvesting and
threshing operations.  Present developments in these areas, d:,scussed
below, could throw some light on future trends.
Effects on Employment of Other Forms of IMIechanization
36.       Weeding:  Three methods of weed control:  chemicals, hand-weeding,
and mechanical weeding or some combination of the three, have been prevalent
in Laguna, and Central Luzon-Laguna 1/. In both areas, particularly Laguna,
the use of the rotary weeder increased, while farmers were making increasing
i.se of chemicals or hand-weeding. In the Laguna and Central Luzon-Laguna
areas, the hired and total weeding labor increased absolutely.  Farmers in
Laguiia where a higher incidence of rotary weeders was the norm in 1966 as
well as in 1970, devoted more man-days of labor to weeding each hectare in
both the terminal years compared to farmers in Central Luzon-Laguna. Thus
it can be concluded that the use of mechanized weeders, and labor inputs
for hand-weeding increase simultaneously. The labor displacement expected
is therefore perhaps more than compensated for by the following three
factors: (a) HYVs make intensive weeding profitable; (b) increased fer-
tilizer use necessitates increased weeding; and (c) the efficiency of the
rotary weeder increases marginal returns to weeding labor.
37, .ransplanting:  The adoption of the rotary weeder makes the
transplanting operation more labor-intensive since straight-row planting
is required. This is evident in the Central Luzon-Laguna data, but in
Laguna proper the effect has probably been offset by the increasing reliance
on the labor-saving dapog seedbed method.
38.       harvesting and Threshing:  In Central Luzon-Laguna, the percentage
of thresher use remained constant between 1966 and 1970. Thus the yield
increase had a direct impact on the labor input for harvesting and threshing.
In Laguna, mechanical threshing is largely unknown, despite the fact that
wages range 30% higher tharn in Central Luzon and yields (and consequently
harvesting and threshing labor requirements) are substantially higher.
I/   See Table 10.



-dffih~                                                                 ANNEX 8
Page 13
39.       The reason for the difference between Central Luzon and Laguna
may be that thresher technology in Central Luzon is an old one, so the
difficulties attendant on the introduction of new machinery are non-existent.
Second, since the thresher commonly used in Central Luzon is the large
McCormick type stationary thresher, the decrease in labor for the actual
threshing operation is partially compensated for by the labor required
for carrying and stocking the grain. In contrast, in Laguna, the introduc-
tion of the new portable UNDP (UPCA) and IRRI threshers has met with
resistance because it poses a threat to;the continuance of the traditional
practice of sharing the benefits of the harvest with those in the village
who are hired for threshing and harvesting tasks. 1/
40.       Nevertheless, the adoption of thresher technology is imperative
where double cropping introduces a need for mechanical threshing to facilitate
harvesting during the wet season, when timeliness is essential. The McCormick
type thresher cannot be transported across muddy fields and it cannot thresh
a wet crop. The small portable thresher designed for local conditions per-
forms better. In view of its limitations, financing of the McCormick type
threshers requires a thorough investigation of their functional efficiency,
and of their economic and social implications. Data required for full
analyses are not available at this time, and the McCormick type thresher
has been excluded from the items eligible for financing under the project.
41.       In sum, one could conclude that mechanization and the new rice
technology have not resulted ia any net labor displacement.  There has in
fact been a modest increase in total ITbR'I-neq4drements per hectare, and a
more significant increase in the use of hired labor. A more detailed picture
of the effects of mechanization on agricultural labor would require a study
of the employment income profile of those individuals who have left the farms.
One hopeful pointer to the future lies in the evidence gathered in the course
of survey research at IRRI (supported partially by preliminary work on these
lines, by Arthur J. Gibb) that in some rice areas there has concurrently
been a rise in non-farm employment.
42.       The Mission's interviews with farmer-borrowers suggested (a) that
there is some displacement of tenant/laborers in Mindanao with the adoption
of tractor technology; and (b) that tractor-use in the Visayan sugar areas
has encouraged the expansion of the borrowers' farm areas. Attempts to
follow up on the subsequent fate of the displaced tenants in Mindanao
elicited the information that they had found employment in neighboring
farms - a not entirely implausible development in view of the considerable
amount of extension of cultivation and even recovery of secondary areas
1/   Given the current high prices, the continuance of the traditional
payment of wages in kind for harvesting and threshing, implies that
the effective wage is the highest paid for labor during the whole
crop cycle.  In fact, many laborers have even been found willing to
undertake free weeding in return for the privilege of harvesting and
threshing.

under growth reportedly being undertaken by individual farmers ifn the
country around Davao. ITn Ilindanao and Negros, interviews with farmers who
had expanded farm size, revealed that (a) the land had previously lain
fallow; cr (b) the land taken in belonged either to the class of absentee
land lords or to the coterie o;. rich plantation owners. Wnether a loss of
social welfare actually occurred because of the induced expansion of the
borrower's farm is therefore still subject to question.
Socio Economic Considerations
43.       Analyses of farm mechanization in the Philippines must take
account of the interaction of tractor technology (through ownership and
custom service), with farm size, tenancy and yields.  However, given the
paucity of survey data, such an attempt is possible only with respect to
rice cultivation in the Philippines.
44.       Yield:  The Gapan survey shows that:  (a) ri ce yields are
inversely related to size, despite the fact that there is no difference
in fertilizer input levels among different farm size groups 1/, and (b) a
direct relation exists between the proportion of tractor-users and farm
size. However it would not be correct to conclude from this that increasing
mechanization adversely affects yields - in fact, mechanization per se does
not affect rice yields at all.  There are no consistent or significant
difference-´ in rice yields between carabao-operated and tractor-operated
farms of approximately the same size and input I evels. The relevant data
indicate that hand-tractor farming may have a slight edge over carabao
farming unless the same quality of land preparation is attained i.e. for
every 1 pass of a hand-tractor-drawn harrow, a carabao-drawn harrow has
to complete 3 passes. The advantage of the tractor stems not from the
quality of land preparation rer se but from its ability to destroy a higher
proportion of the weed growth and to incorporate crop residue into the
soil. Thus if equivalent amounts of work are performed (including weeding),
there appear to be no differences in yield between tractor and carabao
farms.
45.       Data show that tractor farming has gone hand in hand with the
adoption of intensive agricultural practices. Tractor incidence is likely
to be higher oil irrigated double-crop farms, which also apply higher levels
of nitrogen, insecticides, and herbicides, than on partially-irrigated
or rainfed farms, and therefore exhibit higher yields (see Chart WB 8548).
1/   One hypothesis which does .not appear to be tested as yet, is whether
the small farms tend to be located on the more fertile soils. See
Chart WB 8591.



Page 15
46.       A further point concerns the improvement of cropping intensity.
The only documented evidence available is the study by N. Alviar of carabao
and hand-tractor operated farms in Laguna 1964-69. 1/  Tractor farms are
decidedly superior in terms of cropping intensity levels attained (see
Table 11).
47,       Interviews with farmer-borrowers in the Visayas indicated that
sugar yields could be improved with tractor tillage, as compared to yields
obtained with carabao cultivation by a factor of about 1.3. Similarly
deep plowing of some soils in Mindanao could improve corn yields by at
least as much as 5 cavans per hectare per crop.
48.       Farm Size:  On both irrigated and rainfed farms, the percentage
of tractor use seems to be lowest on the farms which are less than 2 ha in
size. Tractor use in rainfed areas tends to be highest on farms larger
than 4 ha in size.  In the irrigated double-cropped zones, tractor use
was highest on the 2-4 ha farms till 1968, but since then , farms larger
than 4 ha appear to have the highest rate of tractor use (see Chart WB 8591),
As for tractor ownership two studies of hand tractor operations in Laguna -
by N. Alviar (1969) and Bert Orcino (1970) - show that the majority of
tractors were owned by farmers operating fairly small sized plots - about
4.5 ha of double-cropped riceland.
49.       N. Alviar's study 2/ of 50 tractor and carabao cultivated farms
in Laguna spanning 5 years, points to the sort of size differences between
the two types of farms, which has been commonly observed in other parts
of the world, e.g. India and Pakistan, the typical tractor farm in Laguna
was found to be more than double the size of te       erage carabao farm._
Tractor ;1 aated farms raxi~4 from 0.7 - 215 ha, and their effective crop
area ranged from 1.4 to 50 ha, as against an effective farm size of 0.4 -
13 ha for the carabao using farms. Similar evidence was noted in the
studies by De los Reyes et al.
50.       A survey of 142 tractor owners in Nueva Ecija, however, revealed
a negative correlation between farm size and the size of tractor units, as
opposed to the proportion of tractor users. This negative relationship may
be fortuitous:  larger farms were the first to mechanize, and consequently
own the older and smaller HP units in the Nueva Ecija survey area. 3/

3/   On the other hand, the timing of the survey (soon after the promul-
gation of the Agrarian Reform Bill) may have induced some large farms
to underreport their size.

o£ the farms ard from 74-87% of the hectarage were oneratae bY tenants.
Among t.n.e more recently developed rice farm areas, IsabeiLa has a Lenancy
rate of 44%, and Cagayan has a rate of 28%. Thus the highest rate of
tenancy is associated with the older more established farming areas, and
it is in these areas that the impact of the Agrarian Reform Bill passed
in 1964 is likely to be greatest.
32L.      According to the Nueva Eci4a survey the most prevalent type of
tractor-owner was the farmer who both owned and operated his holding.
Theno rnumber of pure custom operators were few - only 10 in the sample of
142.  Considering the prevalence of tenancy in Nueva Ecija, the Agrarian
Reform, Program may entail expanded scope for tractor hire or purchase
amongst farmers who are at present tenants. There appears to be little
concentration of tractor ownership among large landlords - hence the
likelihood of landlords forcing their tenants to hire their tractor services
appears to be small (see Table 12).
53.       Custom Hire:  The one important characteristic of tractor owner-
ship which the Nueva Ecija and Gapan studies have in common is the large
incidence of contract hire which appears to be the norm in the Nueva Ecija
area.
54.       The average operation of the 142 tractors surveyed in Nueva Ecija
was about 1,400 hours per year (see Table 12). Custom work accounted for
as much as 75% of the total operating time during the wet season, and as
-,h as 84%∞ ir, the dry season.  Contract service varied with the horsepower
class: larger tractors were used much more widely for custom work than
the smaller units perhaps because they were owned by farmers with smaller
average sized holdings.
P  55.        It has been estimated that about 72% of the four-wheel tractor
and 37% of the hand tractor owners in Gapan, did custom work.  The obverse
of this picture is that farmLers who rented tractor services, constituted
as much as 90% of all tractor users in Gapan.  This shows not only the
continuing diffusion of tractor technology, but also the spread of custom
service operations to iacruasing numbers of small non-owners.  The decision
of this type of farmer on whether or not to use a tractor depends largely
on the comparative cost of carabao and tractor services, the array of

expected product prices, and the importance of time saving. Given the
Philippine goal of self-sufficiency in food, the national plans for the
extension of cultivation, the current context of high prices for rice,
corn and sugar, the exigencies of intensive cultivation, and the possibility
of localized factor shortages, tractorization in Philippine agriculture
appears to be a trend which has come to stay.

TrIRD RURAL CP :D_T PROJECT
On-Farm T       S:G't' .
A.  introduct-ion
1.        The Third Rural Credit Project proposes to finance 250 new and
200 reconditioned farm trucks for the transport of agricultural produce.
The total number of trucks proposed (450), represents a 143% increase over
the total number of trucks (185) for which funds have been disbursed as of
Ocotber 31, 1973, under the Second Rural Credit4 Project. The on-farm
transportation component of the project will constitute less than 1% of
imported truck sales projected for the period 1974-775 and less than 0.45%
of the country's fleet of registered vehicl:es.
2.        The financing of on-farm transportation is justified on several
counts. The transport of farm produce is an essential link in the Philippine
plan to achieve self-sufficiency in cereal production. Farmi trucks reduce
on-farm losses of rice due to spoilage thereby contributing not only to an
enlarged marketable surplus of grain, but also to increased incomes for rice
producers, and especially for those small farmers who cannot command suffi-
cient drying-floor space to be able to dry their crops, and must sell to
the middleman immediately after harvest. In the sphere of sugar production
farm truck transportation can help maintain an optimum production and
milling schedule, and thus prevent the loss of sucrose content. An increase
in the existing fleet of farm trucks will also help to increase competition
among transport agents, and to hold down costs of transport. Reconditioned
trucks have an edge over new trucks to the extent that their lower overhead
costs imply that they are more likely to be within the reach of smaller
farmers. Further farm truck operation creates rural non-agricultural jobs
while the reconditioning industry creates additional employment in the
automotive sector, by utilizing the abundant pool of skilled mechanics, and
service facilities available in the Philippines.
3.        The impetus for farm truck operation derives of course from the
considerable financial benefits accruing to the truck o-wners (Annex 20).
The estimated economic rates of return f-or new and reconditioned trucks are
of the order of 33% and 91% respectively.

4.        Tne imports of trucks and buses has been rising steadily in the
Philippines (See Table 1). Sales data on the period 1969 - 1972, reveal
the following pattern:
Total Sales, Trucks and Buses 1969-72
Year               No of Units                       Value (i.n leaso3)
1969                 11,973                           28,870.Q000
1970                 16s033                           24,6159000
1971                 16,348                           39g051,000
1972                 14,389                           37,609,0003
Imports originate from Germany, Japan, the U. K. and USA.
5.        At present, less than 7% of the total registered cargo trucks
(See 'Table 2) are legally registered for hire (i. e. registered in the TH
category). This is disquieting in view of the fact that the majority of
farms less than 25 has (2,155,000 farms, or abDout 99% cf the total number
of farms) depend on hired transport, or failing that on carabao transport.
C. The Need for Truck Transport
o.        The need for rapid transport of agricultural produce off the
farm, acquires special urgency in the Philippines because of the unpredict-
ability of the rains at harvest time. The moisture content of palay and
drying conditions are the clinching factor in the farmer's decision to hold
or to market his crop immediately after harvest to middlemen or to millers0
Palay up to a moisture content of 14-15% can be held indefinitely. Rains at
harvest make it impossible to dry palay to the safe limit. Palay with a
moisture level of 16-20% can only be held 72 hours; a level of between 20-26%
implies that storage beyond 48 hours will cause deterioration, and palay
with a moisture content of more than 26%, must be sold within 24 hours. Thus
-he suasess of the HYV programme (IAYVs have shorter dormancy), and the
acoption of increased cropping intensities depend on the farmer's ability
to market his crops on time, and at adequate prices. This implies the need
for timely transport of produce off the farm. Increased farm transport will
not only keep transport costs down, but the possibility of marketing direct-
ing to the mills will also induce middlemen to pay adequate farm gate prices.
7.        The element of timeliness is also important to the Philippine
sugar industry. Harvesting and milling schedules have to be dovetailed,
and strictly followed, because tne sucrose content of cane declines rapidly
after maturity (before cutting;, and also after harvest. Farm transport
is therefore essential not only for the movement of cane from the field

to the mills, but also in ensuring that the mills have timely stocks,
adequate in bulk for milling operations.
8.        Farm transport has the disadvantage of being seasonal and primarily
one-way load haulage. Annual ton mileage is thus limited. In this respect
reconditioned trucks score over new trucks by reducing fixed costs per ton
mile.
D.  The Truck Reconditioning Industry
9.        The Philippines is well endowed with skilled mechanics, machinists
and workshops for reconditio-ning, maintaining and servicing motor vehicles
(as witness the "Jeepney" manufacturing and repair industry).
10.       The large truck reconditioning firms do the major part 1/ of the
reconditioning job in-plant Cone large reconditioning firm in Manila,
reconditions about 600 vehicles annually, directly employing over a hundred
men), but also subcontract machining jobs such as crank-shaft grinding, and
spare part manufacturing. Approximately 30% of the replacement components
are manufactured locally. About 400 man-hours of labor (directly and
indirectly employed) are required to recondition each 15 ton GVW truck. The
reconditioning industry also provides a market (for tyres, batteries, wheels
etc) to existing factories and workshops which serve the Progressive Car
Manufacturing Industrv.
11.       Service and Spares Parts.  Truck Reconditioning Firms have sales
and service outlets in mnost major cities. Spare parts and service for all
major makes are available from original equipment suppliers, spare parts
dealers and garages throughout the country.
12.       Procedures for Used Truck Import and Sale.  Imports of reconditioned
trucks are subject to the Central Bank's Memorandum No. 36 to Authorized
Agent Banks. The Central Bank approves applications for the imp?ort- of used
trucks. The applications are reciuired to specify:
(a) Purpose of importation. whether for resale "as is" or
rebuilding/recondei.oning, or for end-use;
(b) Detailed specifications3, country of origirn year of

importer with specific orders for end-use of firms
engaged in construction of infra-structure projects, or
for end-use of agricultural, logging, mining and other
industrial enterprises, as evidenced by documentary proof.
13.       The bulk of the 1/ second-hand trucks come from Japan, are inspected
in Japan and must meet Japanese standards for operation and road worthiness
in order to qualify for export. These vehicles are from 1 to 5 years old
(average age 3.5 years) normally with less than 150,000 km of original use.
14.       Provided the purchaser abides by prescribed operational standards
he obtains a one month unconditional warranty. Service adjustments are
provided free of charge during the warranty period. For commercial operators
a one month warranty is equivalent to the common 10,000 km warranty; commer-
cial trucks clock 300 to 400 km a day, thus often exceeding the 10,000 km
limit in 30 days. The different recuirements of farm transport imply that
farm trucks are used less intensively. The Philippines Used Equipment and
Parts Importers Association (PIA) indicated that they would favorably consi-
der the Mission's proposal to require a warranty appropriate for farm
trucks: a warranty set out either in terms of mileage alone e. g. a 10,000
km warranty, or in terms of usage time equivalent to this.
E   Profitability
15.       The Mission's evaluation of the financial and economic rates of
return on investments in new and reconditioned trucks were based on the
assumption that the ecornomi2 life of both types of trucks would be 8 and 4
years respectively. The cos. 2/ of an 8 ton new truck is p 105,000
(US$15,500) and that of a retonditioned truck V 55,000 (US$8,100).  Financial
rates of return on new and :econditioned trucks achieving loaded usage of
about 60% of annual capaci:y, worked out at around 25% and 65% respectively
1/   90% of the reconditi on&-i t-uckn are {1) Isuzu (Japanese) model TD-70
(standard) 195H2, 15.    -   -5, 8 ton capacity and (2) Isuzu Model

THIRD RURAL CRE-DTT PRO0JECT
Farm Machinery Rapair Shops
A. Introducti_or
1.        The financing of Farm Machinery Repair shops proposed in the
Third Rural Credit Project, is a logical concommittant of the financing
of the four investment categories which form the bulk of the total credit
proposed, namely, farm mechanization, on-farm transport, farm support
facilities and equipment and coastal fishing boats. The c'trrent credit
tranche proposes to make a beginning by financing 250 farn nachinery repair
shops with an average investment each, of about g 50,000 (uS$7,400).
2.        The financing is warranted as it would reinforce the investments
in agricultural mechanization which have been undertaken under the auspices
of the First and Second Rural Credit Projects or are envisaged in the Third
Rural Credit tranche. These investments which consist of tractors, power
tillers, trucks, farm equipment, storage and irrigation facilities and
coastal fishing boats and engines, amount to about r 117.1 M over the
First and Second Rural Credit Projects as of October 1973, and to about
P 239 M in the project currently proposed. Farm machinery repair shops
will help maintain the marginal productivity of these investments by
ensuring their efficient and timely use.
B. The Status of Farm Machinery Repair Services
3.        Mechanical workshops which undertake motor vehicle and farm
machinery servicing and repair throughout the Philippines are hampered,
not by the lack of competent, skilled mechanics and machinists, but by the
lack of adequate facilities and equipment necessary for servicing modern
farm equipment.
4.        Large farms often install their own workshops, or have access
to the more than 120 four-wheel tractor distributors and dealers who
maintain repairshops across the Philippines. Nevertheless the incidence
of these dealer repair shops is ir.adequate and the small farmer, who is
handicapped by lack of transport facilities, usually relies on his neighbor-
hood workshop.



AIEX 1                 __
Page 2

C. Need for iWarm Machinery Repair Shops
o.        The gradual adoption of mechanization in a range of operations
in Philippine agriculture, has induced the need for efficient, timely, and
easily accessible centres for repairing a variety of farm machinery com-
ponents particularly in areas which lie beyond the dealer networks.  The
existing neighborhood workshops provide repair services at lower cost than
the large workshops.  An improvement of their capacities would f4  several
gaps: small workshops would be encouraged to fabricate and stock ziore
complex spare parts; to provide supporting sales, service ard spar£e parts
outlets for the local farm equipment industry and thus to speed up delivery
to the end-user; to assist in the development of appropriate technology
for small farmers; and to provide employment for mechanics and  machinists
in rural areas thereby contributing to the absorption and skilling of
surplus labor.
7.        The most appropriate justification for the strengthening of the
neighborhood workshop is that it would reinforce the other categories of
investment in farm machinery proposed in the Third Rural Credit Project
and the general trend towards the selective mechanization of Philippine
agriculture by reducing the down-time on farm machinery. 1/ Thus, in as
much as farm mechanization has raised the productivity of resources:  land
and labor, in agriculture, the financing of farm machinery repair shops
would be an essential component in the general national agricultural
strategy.
D. Profitability
8.        The Third Rural Credit Project proposes an average investment of
about 1 50,000 in farm machinery repair shops to cover requirements for:
(a) all types of hand tools necessary for servicing tractors, power tillers,
pumps and small engines e. g. open end wrenches, taps and dies, pliers,
vise, hammers, screwdrivers, measuring instruments etc., (b) electrical
equipment e. g. electrical generators, drills, power hacksaws, battery
chargers, grinders, ignition test equipment, paint sprayers etc., (c)
special equipment like hydraulic presses, small lattices, hydraulic jacks,
&li 3(c) construction or improvement of workshop facilities.
9.        The financial and economic rates of return have been computed on
the basis of prevailing costs and returns for major and minor repairs on
trucks, tractors, major overhaul ing jobs for power tillers and small
engines, welding and metal work, parts fabrication and spare parts sales.
The financial rate of retur- works out to about 29%, and the economic rate
of return, after deductior Df1 taxes and duties rises to 33%.

THIRD RURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Fisheries Development
1.        Under the proposed project, financing for purchase of 300 small
motorized costal fishing boats, and construction of 222 inland fishponds
and 50 fishpens for production of milkfish is proposed. The 300 boats of
gross tonnage of up to 20 are intended to help small subsistence fishermen
by enabling them to expand their effective range of fishing and to increase
the catch and income. The fishponds and fishpens would give an additional
income to farmers having access to suitable sites.
2,        Coastal Fisheries:  The marine water surface area of the Philippines
encompasses about 1.7 million square kilometers bounded by the Pacific Ocean,
Celebes Sea, China Sea and the coastal waters of Borneo. These waters harbor
about 2,100 different fish species. It is estimated that the potential of
Philippine waters of less than 100 fathoms deep covering an area of about
200,000 square kilometers is about 600,000 to 800,000 tons of deinersal
(bottom) fish species alone. This excludes the potential of pelagic fishes
in waters of less than 100 fathoms deep and the combined demersal and pelagic
fish potential of nearby waters in the Pacific Ocean and China Sea. It
is estimated that the country has an additional potential of about 650,000
tons of inshore pelagic fish and 300,000 tons of offshore pelagic fish for
a total of 1,650,000 tons or roughly twice the present production.
3.        Coastal Fishing:  Municipal or sustenance fishing 1/ is highly
labor intensive. In the last munico4pal fishing survey conducted by the
Philippine Fisheries Commission (1969), there were 566,000 act±ve fZs'aermen
(now estimated at 574,380) engaged in sustenance fishing ope-ating for their
livelihood from 6,000 marine fishing barrios with no less than 304,000
fishing families.  In operation are some 271,292 fishing bancas of varyr.n-
sizes of not more than 3 tons gross of which 50,849 are motorized an>d 2203Z1
are non-motorized.
4.        The production for marine municipal fisheries amounted to 542,904

5.        Modes of Coastal Fishing:  In the municipal fishing, common
methods used are the hook and line, small trawl, small seine, sla$ll basnig,
gill net, cast nets, crab lift nets, fish pots, dip nets, drive-in-nets and
1/   In the Philippines the term municipal fisheries is used interchangeably
with the term coastal fisheries, Strictly defined, the municipal
fisheries denote marine fisheries conducted with boats of less than 3
gross tonnage.

946 pesos per fisherman.
6.        Fishing Grounds a--d _ Sae auL.tC:  Fishing areas where suste-
nance fishermen operate are limited only to shallow waters:  The boats
operate onlv during fin@ weathe r a lie idle during monsoon. mornths since
they can not withstandl the ta7lese cl-rrents and waves.  Corion fish caught
are small fish species such as ancnchzvls, snappers. ca:alas  -aullets, sardines,
squids, crabs, caesios9 shrimps, ette.
7.        Fishing Cralt  _               3The simplest fishery is carrIed out by
dug-out or open planked bancas rangi-ng from 4 to 9.5 meters.  lowed, paddled,
or non-motorized boats use sails arnd those w:ith engines are usually pow'ered
by gasoline engines of 4 to 15 horse p-ower. These bancas are made of light
-materials and cannot witih 'tId z-h  ewcessi.ve vibration of single cylinder
diesel engines, scantlings and engine bearers.  One disadvantage of using
diesel engines in smail boats is the.ir eleavy weight which makes them unsuit-
able for small dug-outs an; lbaocas.  Another disadvantage 's the cost of
the engine as compared to ga.soline; the latter costs 1/5 of the cost of a
diesel engine of comparable horse power.  Another characteristic of sustenance
fishing is the fishing metdhok used such as hook and line, cast nets, and dip
nets.  Engines for sustenance fishing, are used only in going to the fishing
ground and bringing the catch to the market; hence high speed engines are
more preferable.  Diesel engines are preferable in the bigger fishing craft
more than 3 tons gross where power would play a more important role than
speed, and can be a source of electricity for lighting.
8.        Problems of Coastal Fisheries:  The main problems of coastal
fisheries are summarizedr as followsD
(a)  Majority (81%) of the bancas are not motorized.  They are
paddled or use sails for movem-ent.  The gear used are
simple and the productilLvity per unit effort is low.
(b)  The inability of sitall scale fishermen to raise enough
credit at reasonable rates of interest.
(c)  The procedures of marketing fish are disadvantageous to
the fishemren  .T/ae ick of facilities for handling arid
distribution o'f- fish hastan the deterioration of the
quality of fresh  -ish for sale.  To some extent this
marketing hano-'e.L   cane offset if fishermen are
organized into             es  which may acquire larger
boats of greater            efsFficiency and of greater
mobility to bring thse te      o t¢ more attractive markets.
The Bank loan of $11.6 million (Lomo 39'-TH∞ Philippine - Fisheries Credit   1
Project) presently bei-g 2adminl;m2tered by DBP for a i:rogram for developwtens of
marine and inland fish productfc..r  incl&iu(' s financing of 60 fishing vessels.
It is, however, intended for larger commercial fishing boats of 70 or more

gross tons, and excludes the classes of coastal fishing boats of 20 or less
gross tonnage recommended for the proposed project.
9.        To overcome these problems, the coastal fisheries require larger
motorized boats equipped with efficient fisning gear for the purpose of
extending the range of operation and bringing their catch to more attrac-
tive markets.  For this, the aviailability or medium and Long-term credit to
finance the required capital expenditure would be essential.  The required
technical assistance for the modernization of coastal fisheries would be
available from the fisheries extension service provided by the Bureau of
Fisheries.  Under the second rural credit project, lending for coastal
fisheries was sluggish (only 30 financed) because of the tonnage limitation
of 5 tons net and the lack of collateral on the part of fishertlen.  Under
the proposed project, the tonnage would be increased to 20 tons gross and
the collateral problem would be greatly eased as the government would extend
guarantees under ARF.
10.       Inland Fisheries:  This component wou2ld be a continuation of the
program to finance fishponds under the on-going second credit project, under
which 192 sub-loans have been made. No substantive increase over the second
project is proposed.
11.       Financial Viability:  Financial projections for five model vessels
are given in Annex 19, Tables 8-12, and those for inland fisheries in Annex
19, Tables 13-14.

THIRD RURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Livestock Development
A. Introduction
1.        Financing of 750 poultry projects, 1,500 swine projects and 200
dairy projects, all on a backyard scale, has been proposed for the Third
Pural Credit Project.  Disbursements for livestock development as of
October 31, 1973, under the Second Rural Credit Project were about V 4.6
million for poultry and Y 5.2 million for swine projects. The Third Rural
Credit Project proposes to invest about t 8.8 million in poultriy projects
(a 911Z increase), 9 15.3 million in swine projects (a 194% increase), and
about t 2.3 million in dairy projects, bringing the total livestock
component to t 26.5 million.  Whereas the average sub-loan under the Second
Rural Credit Project was of the order of t 27,880 per poultry project and
i 24,530 per swine project, the Third Rural Credit Project proposes to
scale down the size of investments and to increase the number of sub-loans
in each category. Project costs per poultry project will be around f 10,000
(US$1,475) per sw,ine project, around F 8,700 (US$1,280) and per dairy project
around 1 10,000 (US$1,475). 1/
2.        The investment in livestock development is in line with the Govern-
ment's efforts to increase the supply of pigs, poultry and of dairy products
to meet the demand for neat and reconstituted milk products. It is justified
because the small backyard project can supplement the farmer's income from
his farming activities, provide fuller emplovment to family members, and can
take advantage of farm by-products to overcome the problems associated with
the scarcity and high cost of feed, 2/ which the larger livestock units face. 3/
The livestock component of the project is thus in line with efforts to make
loans accessible to small agriculturalists with limited means. The estimated
financial rates of return vary between 20% - 647 while the economic rate of
return range between 347 and 99%. The weighted average economic rate of
return on the poultrv, swine and dairy project investments is expected to be
66%.
1/   See Tables 1 to 3.
2/   The farm. models set out in Arnex 19 do however assume that feed supplies
are purchased from the narkrt.
3/   The TBRD's Livestock Develornent loan 823-PH provides loans for livestock
projects much larger ir. scale Lhan those proposed under the Third Rural
Credit Project.

B. Status of the Livestock Industry
3.        The livestock sector accounts for about 20% of the gross value
of agricultural production. However, domestic meat production has been
lagging behind population growth. The current four-year development plan
therefore emphasises livestock production as a means of fulfilling the
dezand for meat.  The planned targets for the 1971-74 period were set out
as 8.25% per poultry, 8% for pork, 6%0 for beef and 7.3% for eggs. The
(.overnment's poultry and pig program targets have been set out as follows:
Poultry Meat, Egg, and Pork Production
('000 tons)
1972      1973      1974       1974
Poultry Meat
(dressed weight)               96       104        112       121
Eggs                            114        122       131       141
Pork                            423        456       493        532
4.        The poultry and pig sectors have been characterized bv two major
developments in recent years, the trend towards commercial production and
the lack of a dependable source of feeds at an economic price. Commercial
pig growers accounted for 10% of the pork production, by 1973, and commercial
poultry enterprises produced over 65% of the chicken eggs. This has been
brought about by the uncertainty and high costs associated with feed, requiring
contractual arrangements or semi-integration between feed mills, hatcheries
and poultry and pig producers.
5.        The Government's agricultural development plans envisage increased
yellow corn and sorghum output mainly by way of increased yields expected
from fertiliser use on high yielding (disease-resistant) varieties. Southern
and Western Mindanao have the land resources for increased feed grains
production.
6.        Egg production is highly developed in the Philippines, specialized
production units supplying an estimated 75% of the nation's eggs. Commercial
egg production is distributed throughout the islands with the heaviest con-
centration near Greater Manila and in Cebu province.
7.        Milk consumption is largely in the form of filled and reconstituted
milk products made from imported milk powder.  Demand for dairy products is
increasing and the value of imports rose to about ITS$38.4 million in 1971.

S.        On-farm poultry production for farzily consumption is a common
practice. The on-farm and commercial no-ulation has expanded radically
only since the development of conmercial poultry.  A 1969 national survey
demonstrated that about 90% of the clbickens on farms were in units of over
500 birds, while the 1970 population estimate of 94.4 million birds includes
37.4 million on non-farm operations.  The farm chicken population has been
decreasing since 1970, whereas total population has increased.

9.        This has probably been caused by the continuing shortage and
increase in price of meats and meat products caused by the shortage and
high cost of feeds. Feed costs at present account for about 80% of total
operating costs. 1/ Between 1965 and early 1973 prices have risen by 907
both for domestically available and imported feed ingredients whereas
poultry meat prices have risen only 54% and eggs prices 78%. Imported
ingredients are also in short supply world-wide.
10.       The expected continuation of short feed supplies and increasing
feed costs encouraged the Mission to propose the financing of small poultry
(layer) operations capable of being integrated into existing farm enterprises
(see Annex 1) where labor would be supplied by the farm family and the
supply of feeds could be supplemented by farm output or by-products such as
corn, sorghum, or rice bran. Layers replaced every year would provide an
important source of poultry meat. The project's proposed output of eggs,
and poultry meat could be easily absorbed by the domestic market. Average
yearly egg production in the model poultry project (see Table 1) is about
8365 dozens per project, of which 99.5% could be marketed at an average
wholesale price of ) 3.60 per dozen. About 250 culls, each of average weight
1.5 kg, are sold annually at p 4.50 per kg liveweight. The market for
droppings is strong, the demand emanating primarily from fish farmers and
vegetable growers, present prices averaging 9 70.00 per ton ex-farn (a 40%
increase having occurred since the start of the year). The estimated financial

rate of return from the poultry project is es high as 64%., and the economic
rate of return is in the region of 99%.
D. Swine
11.       The swine population has been increasing steadily in recent years.
Year            Populationl         Z% On-Farm Population
('000 heads)
1970              6,436                      98.4
1971              7,030                      98.0
1972              7,742                      97.6
1973              8,627                      98.0
Backyard pig production is general throughout the islands, the most important
regions being the Eastern Visavas, and North and Eastern Mindanao.  The
small farm (less than 50 head) population has remained relatively stable as
a percentage of population, but the recent shortages of local corn and rice
bran in 1971-72 coupled with the inadequate distribution facilities in E.
X'isavas and Mindanao have led to some decrease in backyard production in
these provinces.  Large scale production units on the other hand have grown
near the sources of premixed feeds like Central Luzon and Southern Tagalog. 1f
The feed milling industry estimated that 10% of the hogs marketed in FY
1971-72 were produced in large units.
12.       The Philippines is well suited to pork production.  It is potentially
easy to eliminate particular swine diseases on an area basis and the
country does have the potential for achieving self - sufficiency in feed
grains necessary to support a greatly expanded swine industry. Pork ls a
highly favored meat in the Philippines 2/ - consumption being constrained
primarily by retail price levels, purchasing power, and supply.
13.       It is estimated that though large commercial piggerles may supply
an increasing share of the pork market in the future, there is ample oppor-
tunity for many small producers to undertake swine production. Feed require-
lents could be supplemented from existing farm sources. Siting of the swine
projects in Mindanao would of course enable relatively low cost production,
and at the same time provide an outlet for the corn gluts which threaten in
1/   Feed which accounts for 75-85%' of hog production costs, is an important
factor determining growth.
2/   According to the preliminary estimates of the Bureau of Agricultural
Economics, DANR, however, the number of carcasses processed in registered
slaughter-houses fell between 1970 and 1972-73, due perhaps to rising
prices and the availability of other meats.

favorable crop years 1/. The proposed backyard swine project (5 brood sows)
could dispose of about 67 weaners annually at t 150 each, and 1 culled sow
of 150 kg average weight at f 4.75 kg liveweight (see Table 2). The estimated
financial rate of return is about 35% and the economic rate of return is
expected to be about 51%.
E. Dairy
14.       There has been a rising trend in demand for dairy products since
1960. Consumption of milk products grew by 84% between 1960-70. Per
capita consumption has however registered a decline between 1969 and 1971.
15.       No official estimates on the number of milk animals in the country
are available. Unofficial estimates for 1971 were 48,190 head, made up of
11,700 milk cows, 29,050 cara-baos and 7,400 goats. The average milk yields
of native cows is estimated at 561 kg while imported breeds average 1,890 kg.
Carabaos yield about 592 kg annuallv, while goats average 43 kg. The
potential yield of a carabao is about 3 times the current average.
16.       Fresh milk production was reported to be about 25,000 m tons in
1970 and about 27,500 m tons in 1971, probably less than half of this was
consumed as fluiid milk. Fresh milk is produced either by small farmers or
by the relatively large commercial dairies. Small farmers generally milk
1 - 2 carabao or zebu cows for home consumption, excess milk being sold
to middlemen or converted into cottage cheese and sweets. About 96-97%
of the total milk is imported. (See Table 4). The Bureau of Animal
Industry estimates that over 90% of the total milk consumed is in the form
of canned, filled, reconstituted or condensed milk.
17.       The Government has been reviewing its policy on dairy development.
The Board of Investments in the meantime has listed dairy farming as a
priority industry and the five year plan has included in its program the
establishment and operation of at least five milk collection and chilling
centres.
18.       One cooperative milk collection scheme is at present operated bv
BAI, the Sta. Maria schieme based ir Dulacan. At present, 44 barrios supply
about 1,100 liters of milk per dayz to the scheme, involving some 450
cooperators milking 520 carabellas.  However, since factory pasteurizing
capacity is 1,000 liters/hour,  1-, -lant can only operate at a profit in the
agricultural off-season, when milk suny-ly increases to 3,000 liters/day.
1/   A large viable swine indusrr  :n Southern Cotabato would require adequate
corn drying, storage and e    t<tion facilities and availability of
pre-mixed additives and feer. 74rain supplements.



ANNEX 12
Page   6
19.       In addition to this scheme, th! Dairy Training and Research
Institute (DTRI) at Los Banos, Laguna co'llects milk from 18 barrios involving
187 farmers.
20.       Both schemes supply extension services to cooperators, in sanita-
tion, breeding, nutrition and management. Tested breeding bulls or A. I.
services are available and cattle, carabao and Murrah buffalo have been
distributed to farmers. Acidic milk unsuitable for pasteurization is
converted into cheese or separated for butter and ghee. Pasteurized milk
is cartoned and marketed in the Manila Metropolitan Area. The DTRI scheme
offers similar services to its cooperators.
21.       Dairy projects financed under the Third Rural Credit Project would
be limited to areas served by the Sta. Maria and D. T. R. I. schemes.
Finance would be made available for new cooperators and current cooperators
who may wish to expand their herd. The proposed credit tranche does not
envisage financing of commercial herds.
22.       The backyard dairy model assumes that operation of a 2-cow herd
of hurrah carabao stock may be integrated into an irrigated rica farming
enterprise. Milk production has not been maximised since it is envisaged
that the animals will be dual-purpose types, each being available for
three months draft work for custom as well as farm work. Concentrates are
supplied at a low level to supplement normal grazing and ensure an average
yield of 2 liters of milk per day in a 250-day lactation. Calves will be
given some skim milk. Weaners are sold off at six months. Normally, it
would he more profitable to raise calves until they could be sold off as
breeders, but in the model the farm size is too small to allow adequate
pasturage. The estimated financial rate of return from the project is
about 20% and the net economic rate of return is expected to rise to 34%. 1/

THIRD RUTRAL CREDIT' PROJ2CT
Cottage Agro-indmstrv try  o-,en
Fishmeal Plants
1.        The proposed project would include about 50 units of small cottage
scale fishmeal plants of conventional type wi7th very sizple outdoor drying
stands. No reliable statistical data are available regarding the number of
such plants operating at present or their output. As the supply of cheap
trash fish has increased along with steadily increasing comaercial fisheries
harvest, which has grown by about 8% per year during the past decade and
reached 1.0 million ton today, there i$ ncE scope for a limited number of
small scale fishmeal plants.  There are now about 20 fairly large fishmeal
enterprises arotmd the Navotas fish market alone. Miany of their operations
are fairly large with an annual trash fish input ranging between 2,000 to
6,000 tons per year.
2.        The high average price of fish in the Philippines, ranging
between r 1,500 (US$221) and V 2,000 (US$295), would appear to rule out
any possibility of profitable fishmeal enterprise. However, it is estimated
that over 10% of the harvest from commercial fisheries is trash fish, and
there is a fairly large supply of such trash at prices ranging between
X 350 and 400 (US$52-59) per ton, and the supply is expected to increase
steadily in the future because of the increasing commercial harvest and the
strong demand for trash for fishmeal production.
3.        The fishmeal plants now in operation recover fishmeal at the rate
of about 20% of the raw fish input. The market for the product has been
strong and, with the expanding feed industry in the country, is expected to
remain so for the foreseeable future. The average price fetched for fish-
meal has been about Y 3,500 (equivalent to the cost of imported fishmeal in
1973), although this high average reflects the very high prices paid for the
choice fishmeal peddled for human consumption in the remote interior.
Woodcraft Plants
4.        The project would include about 50 units of woodcraft plants of
conventional labor-intensive type with some machines and tools.  There are
about 3,300 such units in operation scattered throughout the country.
Official estimates show woodcraft export of US$7.0 million for 1971, an
average annual growth for the sector of 40% since the 1967 export of $1.5
million. These statistics do not include the very large woodcraft product
export associated with tourists, All indications, including information
from woodcraft products traders, are that the export market would remain
viable.



OM NEX 13
Page 2
5.        There are two principal problems impeding progress of the woodcraft
industry today. The first has to do primarily with cottage woodcraft and
arises from its inability to produce standardized products.  This inability,
rooted in part in the proud tradition of creative artistry, has kept the
industry engaged almost entirely in production of "souvenirs, " such as
figurines, wooden beer mugs, etc. The second has been the absence of
quality control which is a pre-condition for large scale marketinig.
6.        The prospects for marketing of "souvenir" items appear to be fairly
good, but it is now apparent that the bulk of future expansion wn export
woodcraft products would be functional (as against souvenir) products, and
the cottage woodcraft industry is in need of revamping its production
techniques to introduce quality control. To accomplish this, the industry
would require tools and equipment considerably more sophisticated than the
simple hand tools presently being used, so that it could produce according
to "specifications" rather than the inclination of the producer.
7.        The need for such a redirection is now widely recognized by the
government and the industry which has often failed in recent years to honor
orders from large marketing chains for standardized woodcraft products. The
50 units envisaged under the project would be a very small fraction of the
industry, but are expected to play an important role in modernizilng a tradi-
tional rural industry.

PHILIPPINES
THIRD RURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Terms of Reference for a Proposed Study
"Performance Evaluation of the CB-IBRD Rural Credit Program'
Introduction
1.        The Central Bank of the Philippines received an IBRD loan (432-PH)
of US$5 million in 1965 to provide medium and long-term funds to rural
banks for the financing of agricultural development. Upon full disbursement
of the above loan, the Central Bank received another IBRD loan (607-PH) of
US$12.5 million in 1969 for continuation of the earlier project, and this
lending program is being extended with a further IBRD loan (Third Rural Credit
Project) of US$22 million in 1974. The Central Bank of the Philippines re-
lends the proceeds of the Loan to qualified rural banks and SSLAs to augment
their medium and long-term lending capacity to agricultural producers for
approved development purposes.
2.        In view of the need to a-sess the progress of implementation and
to evaluate the financial and econcmic impacts of the project for the pur-
pose of directing the credit resources to most productive uses, consistent
with sound banking practices, a study entitled "Performance Evaluation of
the CB-IBRD Rural Credit Program" to be conducted by a group of qualified
local experts is proposed.
Objectives
3.        The principal objectives of this study would be:
(a) To assess the financial, economic, employment, and social
impacts of the various categories of lending operation
under the program (the First, Second and the Third Rural
Credit Project);
(b) To review the appropriateness of lending terms and
conditions and channels for achieving the stated objectives
of the program;
(c)  To determine the changes5 if any, in the framework of the
program indicates to make it more effective;



ANNEX 14
Page  2                 _
(d)  To make periodic reports on the findings of the study to
the Central Bank so that the findings may be reflected in
program implementation; and
(e) To provide information and analyses useful for preparation
of similar future projects.
Preliminary Outline of the Proposed Study
4.        The following topics would be covered:
(a)  The significance of the program in the context of
current Government agricultural development policy
goals, including its role in:
(i) providing medium and long-term agricultural credit;
(ii) building sound rural credit institutions;
(iii) assisting the food self-sufficiency campaign;
(iv)  implementing the on-going agrarian reform program;
(v) facilitating agricultural mechanization, tractorization
in particular;
(vi) contributing to increases in agricultural exports; and
(vii) enhancing rural income and employment.
(b)  Quantitative summaries of sub-loans by sub-project categories
(with special emphasis on tractors and power tillers), by region,
by size of borrowers' land holdings for each of the main crops
grown and their outputs, and the types of collateral offered.
(c)  Institution building effects the program has had on partici-
pating rural banks in terms of the volume of additional
resources, standards of appraisal and loan supervision, and
profitability.
(d)  Investigation of the reasons for high arrears of farmer-bor-
rowers and rural banks in terms of ability and willingness to
repay, and determinatiorn of ways in which arrears can be
reduced.
(e)  Financial impacts oi trhe suo-projects, tractor and power tiller
components in part`.- i-ar, u:por the borrower-operators as
well as the secondar-2 beaefr.ciaries who hire their services.
This topic would s.'.  ee the realized and expected effects
of tractorization upon productivity, extensification, inten-
sification and causes ari extent, if any, of production cost
reducation.



ANNEX 14
Page  3
(f) Employment effects of the sub-projects, tractorization in
particular, upon hired and family labor, including analyses
of the chief factors inducing tractorization, such as simple
cost reduction, shortage of labor and carabao (buffalo), and
of instances where tractorization is a necessary condition
for the production concerned and those where it is not a
necessary condition.
(g) Economic impacts of the program, including:
ti) analyses on iacremental outputs of the sub-projects
with justifications for the prices applied;
(ii) estimates of economic costs of investment and opera-
tion of the sub-projects; and
(iii) evaluation of whether the various categories of the
sub-projects are the most appropriate of alternatives
available for accomplishing the stated objectives.
(h) Identification of new components for the program, including
the expected financial and economic results, the magnitude of
investment, lending terms and conditions recommended.
Timetable
5.        The study should start within 6 months from the date of effective-
ness and would require about 18 months. The first interim report would be
submitted at the end of the sixth month, and the second at the end of the
first year after the signing of the contract and the final report eighteen
months after the contract.
Financing
6.        The study would be fully financed out of the proceeds of the loan.
Cost of the Study
7.        The following is the estimated cost of the proposed study:

V. Financial Rate of Retulrn:  47.3%
1/  This illulstrative rice fans model involves a 15 ha farm.  Mechanization is undertaken with an imported 60 BHP,
4-wheel tractor with a 312611 disc plow and disc harrow at a cost of F73,235.
2/  Gross income from rice sales is computed assuming a fanm gate price of 933.5 per cavan.  Yield is assumed tc be
80 cavans/ha with WiYV use.  Cropping intensity befcre development is taken to be 150%. Mechanization is assumed
to effect a 15% increase in cropping intensity, raising it to 172.5%.
3/  An imported 60 BHP b-wheel tractor is assumed to have an annual usage of 1,500 hours, of which 804 is assumed
to be "productive". The owner is assumed to use the tractor on his own farm only for land cultivation, and
to undertake 285 ha of custom work per annum, at 911±0/ha.
4/  The beneficiary's 10% contribution to the investment cost.
3/  CB/IPRD loan assused to be 90% of project cost.
6/  During the first year, interest is capitalized at 12% annual interest.

THIRD RURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Economic Evaluation
Introduction
1.        At full development, the project would have provided subloans to
about 8,000 farmers and rural entrepreneurs in six principal categories of
productive activities in rural areas: (a) farm mechanization, (b) on-farm
transportation, (c) farm support facilities and equipment, (d) fisheries
development (coastal and inland), (e) small scale livestock development,
and (f) cottage agro-industries (fishmeal and woodcraft plants).
Production
2.        The direct benefits from the proposed project would derive from
the increase in production resulting from the various investments. Farm
mechanization (tractorization) would help increase rice production in line
with the government policy directed towards intensification in the most
suitable areas and would contribute to increased sugarcane production in
meeting the country's increasing domestic sugar demand and its export re-
quirements. The increased production of poultry, pork, dairy and fish
products would generate additional sources of income for small farmers and
help improve nutritional stanctards in the rural areas.  Investments in
cottage agro-industries would create additional productive activities for
export of woodcraft products and import substitution of fishmeal products.
Investments in on-farm transportation, farm machinery repair shops, private
irrigation and on-farm storage and the various farm equipment would support
farm mechanization, livestock and fisheries development. The estimated
total annual incremental output during the life of investment ranging from
4 to 10 years is summarized in the following table:

Financial Viability
3.        In the Philippines where climatic conditions permit year-around
farming in irrigated areas, the degree of utilization of tractors is likely
to be high, and, therefore, the estimated financial rates of return on
investment in the various types of tractor, which account for 54% of the
total project cost, are quite high. In fact the impetus for tractorization
ia the country has been its high financial rates of return. The estimated
rates of return on other investments under the proposed project are also
high. The detailed cash flow projections for the various investments
appear in Annex 19, Tables 1-19, and the estimated financial rates of
return and the sensitivity analyses in Annex 20. The following is a
summary of the estimated financial rates of return:

the minor investment items such as machinery parts, minor equip-
ment, farm storage and private irrigation.
Economic Viability
4.        Economic Benefits from Incremental Outputs:  Four _ategories of
incremental production are expected from the project: (a) exports, (b)
import substitutes, (c) goods for domestic consumption, and (d) services
for domestic consumption.
(a)  Exports:  Two items among the incremental production are
exports; sugar and woodcraft products. These account for
about 30% of the incremental production. Sugar has been
valued at US$0.08 per pound in accordance with the latest
commodity price guidelines. Woodcraft products have been
valued at ex-factory prices, US$0.90 per piece.
(b)  Import-Substitutes:  The bulk (45%) of the incremental
production consists of import-substitutes; rice, corn
and fishmeal. Consistent with the guidelines mentioned
above, milled rice has been valued at US$170 per ton, corn
US$80 per ton, and fishmeal US$516 per ton (the current
and projected cost of imported fishmeal in the Philippines).
(c)  Goods for Domestic Consumption:  Four items of incremental
output fall under this category; (i) poultry products (eggs
and meat), (ii) pork, (iii) dairy (carabao) milk, and (iv) fish
(marine and inland).  These account for 15% of the incre-
mental output.  While part of the incremental output would
substitute imported dairy products and canned fish, their
import-substitution effects are likely to be equivalent to
their farmgate prices.

7.        Foreign Exc xange Gai a:   ogainst the US$22.0 mLillion for the
total foreign exctange cost of the investment, and US$$44 miiLion for the
ncreneytal    ..2 foreign eshxn6iga c5St o£ operation for the entire 8,000
stub-loans, the net anaua;l foreign exchange gains resulting from the project
would be about US$40 million.  Thus, she rate of return in terms of foreign
exchange benefit/cost would be about 200%.
8.        Income Effect:  At the estimated average 45% financial rate of
return, the totai annual iiacremental in.comae accruing to the 8,000 beneficiaries
from the project's total investment of about/p 300 miLlion (US$44 million)
would be about V 100 million (US$14.7 million) after paying p 32 million
(US$4.7 million) in interest paymants to the 250 participating rural banks
and savings and loan associations  The average beneficiary's annual incre-                j
mental net income would be about V 12,500 (US$1 ,O00).  In addition, the



LqNEX 21
Page 5
8,000 owner/operators of the project would pay annually about V 22 million
(US$3 million) in incremental wages for the workers filling the new job
opportunities created under the proposed project. There would be a
further income effect for the 270 participating banks amounting to an
annual incremental gross income of about Y 15.6 million (US$2.3 million)
arising from the difference between the 12% annual rate of interest charged
to the beneficiaries on 90% of the total project cost and the 7% annual
rate of interest paid to the Central Bank on the 80% of the project cost.
This would give an annual incremental gross income of about f 58,000
(US$8,555) to an average participating bank.
Employment Effect
9.        The proposed project would create about 10,000 new jobs and enhance
the productivity of about 8,000 additional rural workers. In addition, about
94,000 farm households hiring tractors financed under the project for custom
work would gain from using their family labor for more productive work
(Annex 21, Table 6).
Benefits to Small Farmers and Fishermen
10.       About 94,000 small farmers who are expected to hire the tractors
financed under the project fox land preparation would profit from the custom
work done at reasonable rates. Most of them would be too poor to own carabao
or power tillers and have to depend on custom work. Without the proposed
project, the custom rates may rise sharply and they would probably have to
pay much more than F 140 per ha of rice farm projected under the project.
In addition, the proposed project would create about 2,000 full-time job
opportunities for small subsistence fishermen and equip an additional
2,000 with more efficient boats and fishing gear. The average annual catch
per fisherman under the project is expected to increase from the present
1 ton to about 4.7 tons.
