A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The project aims to enhance the capacity of Georgia to negotiate and implement oil and gas transit
agreements in a manner that maximizes economic benefits, and minimizes social and environmental costs.
Georgia has considerable potential for transit of hydrocarbons, particularly by comparison to its other
economic assets. However, realizing positive net benefits from large transit investmnents (in a very complex
geopolitical context) requires very careful management by the State and substantial institution building.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
The success of the project will be assessed by reference to the following key performance
indicators:
Expected benefits from transit agreements actually realized.
Compliance with legal agreements and Georgian legislation (by Government agencies and private
investors).
Audit reports published.
Actual examples of enforcement of liability legislation occur.
Agreements governing financial relations between Government, GIOC, and GGIC are respected.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: 17000-GE         Date of latest CAS discussion: September 22, 1997
This project was not included in the last CAS, but it will be cited in the CAS scheduled for Board
discussion in the fourth quarter of FY200 1. The project does, however, support three of the CAS priorities,
namely: "1) stabilization support, as continued weaknesses in public finance jeopardize the stabilization
objective; 2) strengthen and diversify sources of growth by removing remaining barriers to private sector
development; and 3) assist the Govemment in introducing institutional and policy reforms needed to protect
Georgia's environmental and natural resources."
The proposed project will support the first priority through consultancy assistance to maximize the
Government's pipeline revenues and minimize its liabilities. The second priority will be pursued by
consultancy assistance to ensure that transit agreements are negotiated and implemented in a manner that
balances the interests of investors and of Georgia, thereby reducing the long-term political risk faced by
private investors in infrastructure in Georgia. The third priority will be addressed through technical
assistance in review of environmental impact assessments and related environmental permit applications for
pipelines (and subsequent monitoring and public outreach), as well as in oil spill prevention and mitigation
for non-pipeline transportation of oil.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Large investments in transit pipelines made by the private sector give rise to many complex fiscal,
environmental, social, political, legal and institutional issues for the host government. Georgia has gained
- 2 -



some experience in managing such issues through six years of implementation of the Baku-Supsa early oil
pipeline (which transports crude oil from Azerbaijan to the Georgian termiinal of Supsa) and through the
transit of gas from Russia to Armenia. However, the new agreements coming into place impose greater
obligations on the Government than the existing arrangements, and do so within a more complex
environment than prevailed in the past. New framework legislation has been adopted but is untested in
application, geopolitical competition over Caspian resources has intensified, synergies between oil and gas
transit have emerged, land ownership has become more dispersed through privatization, and civil society's
awareness of pipeline issues has developed. These challenges and opportunities are testing the State's
ability to coordinate its agencies in fulfilling its responsibilities to investors and to its citizens.
The Government's strategy for dealing with these challenges has centered on clearly designating
key agencies responsible for coordination, and strengthening their capacity. For oil pipeline coordination,
the key agency is the Georgian International Oil Corporation (GIOC), and for gas pipelines, the Georgian
Gas International Corporation (GGIC). Multiple government agencies are involved in transit pipelines,
most notably the Ministries of Environment and of Finance. The Government has undertaken a major
donor mobilization effort to support institution building for interfacing with private investors in pipelines,
and with the public over pipeline-related issues.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The main issues to be addressed by the project are how to enhance the institutional capacity of
GIOC, GGIC, and the Ministry of Environment most effectively, and how to ensure those agencies
collaborate efficiently with multiple other state agencies. Terms of reference for consultants financed by
the project will reflect the objective of interagency coordination. The increasingly close relationship
between oil and gas transit issues means that coordination between GIOC and GGIC is of paramount
importance, as well as with the Ministry of Environment. Project management arrangements are designed
to enhance such coordination (through a steering committee mechanism).
C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
A. Environmental and Technical Advice for Pipeline Implementation will include consultancy services
to assist the Government in fulfilling its obligations under oil and gas pipeline transit agreements on a
timely basis (Georgia incurs substantial liabilities if there are delays against very short deadlines in the
agreements). These services will focus on reviewing environmental/social impact assessments, pernitting,
compliance monitoring, and public outreach. The component will thus go beyond environmental impact
assessment, and will strengthen long-term environmental management capacity. This will involve
environmental, social, technical, and public communications consultants (international and local) to address
oil and gas transit issues jointly. It will also include technical/environmental advisors for negotiations of
transit of gas from (or through) Russia (technical advisors for negotiation of East-West gas transit have
been provided by USTDA).
B. Legal Advice for Pipeline Implementation will include specialized pipeline lawyers to advise the
Government on legal issues arising from implementation of the various transit agreements negotiated,
including the revision of Georgian legislation where necessary. Financial or fiscal skills may also be
needed to complement legal advisory skills. These advisors will only be needed once existing consultancy
contracts (financed by the Structural Reform Support Project, SRS) expire, and precise terms of reference
will be elaborated at that time.
-3 -



C. Company Audits will include financial audits (according to internationally-accepted standards) to be
conducted annually for GIOC and GGIC to enhance transparency of company operations (audits are to be
published in the Georgian press). The credit will finance part of the cost of the company audits in the first
year of the project only.
D. Non-pipeline Oil Spill Prevention and Mitigation Component will address oil spill risks related to
marine and rail transportation of oil, through (i) the provision of essential equipment to facilitate spill
response, monitoring and enforcement by the Ministry of Environment; (ii) consultant services; and (iii)
training.
E. Project Implementation will be provided by the PIU currently managing the technical assistance
component of the Structural Reform Support Project and the Judicial Reform Project, in conjunction with
GIOC, GGIC, the Ministry of Environment and other agencies responsible under the transit agreements.
This component will provide for office equipment, annual audit of the project accounts, incremental
operating costs and related needs.

Identifiable taxes are estimated at US$2.15 million. Total cost net of taxes is US$10.14 million.
2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The project does not have a major reform orientation. However, the financial and political
sustainability of the institutional building to be achieved depends partly on rationalization of the financial
relations between the Government on the one hand, and GIOC and GGIC on the other hand. The project
aims to enhance the capacity of GIOC and GGIC to provide specific services to the Government to achieve
its transit pipeline objectives, rather than enhancing their own commercial operations. At the same time, the
revenue arrangements for existing transit pipelines do not adequately distinguish between quasi-tax
revenues and commercial revenues. For oil pipelines, the project will seek to establish a more appropriate
financial arrangement along the lines given below (which was developed in consultation with the IMF). For
gas pipelines, a similar arrangement will be sought once the nature of gas transit becomes as clear as for oil
transit. The main points of these agreements are to be published in the Georgian press, as are annual audits
of GIOC and GGIC. These agreements are expected to establish a model for other state enterprises in
Georgia.
I. As part of the annual government budget cycle, the Ministry of Finance and GIOC will agree on
the expected cost of services to be provided in the coming fiscal year by GIOC to the Government in
respect of implementation of the Baku-Supsa Pipeline Construction and Operating Agreement and the
Baku-Thilisi-Ceyhan Major Export Pipeline Host Government Agreement (and any other agreed transit
corridor). The services in question should be detailed in the agreement;
2. The "cost of services" can include remuneration of an agreed portion of GIOC's start-up capital
(e.g. part of the repayment of other loans, such as the subloan from the IDA Oil Institution Building
Credit). Any grant financing (by donors or the GoG Budget) of these services should be deducted from
the "cost of services" to be billed to GoG in terms of this agreement;
3. All tariff income from Baku-Supsa in excess of the agreed cost of services will be transferred to
the Ministiy of Finance as dividend income;
4. GIOC will be subject to annual audits of international standard to be submitted to the Ministry of
Finance by June 30 of the year following the audit year;
5. The Profit Tax levied on Baku-Thilisi-Ceyhan shall be remitted directly and in full by the MEP
Participants to the Budget as provided by the HGA (the HGA makes no provision for state revenue
from the MEP Participants other than the Profit Tax). No Profit Tax will be paid to GIOC.
3. Benefits and target population:
The proposed project will increase the capacity of key state agencies to negotiate and implement
pipeline transit agreements and other large infrastructure projects on behalf of the Government. Transit
pipelines are likely to be the largest investment in Georgia in the coming years, and could be the largest
single taxable entity by the latter half of this decade. Current plans envisage transit pipeline investments of
about US$ 1 billion in Georgia, which would be of very substantial macroeconomic significance. Oil
pipelines alone could bring US$ 50 million per year in tax revenue, and revenue from gas pipeline transit
could be significantly larger. Net fiscal benefits from such investments will be maximized with assistance
from the project, and the social and environmental impact will be more effectively managed. Georgia will
establish itself as a reliable host country for similar investments, and public perception of those investments
will be enhanced. The target population includes the whole of Georgia.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Procurement, financial management, and general oversight under the project will be handled by the
Project Implementation Unit currently implementing the technical assistance component of the Structural
Reform Support Project and the Judicial Reform Project, and one IDF grant (the PIU is attached to the
Ministry of Economy, Industry and Trade). In the past, the samne PIU also managed the Institution
Building Project, SATAC I, SATAC II, and two IDF grants. This PIU has seven years' experience
implementing Bank-financed projects involving multiple agencies, and has a proven track record.
Technical implementation of project components for oil pipelines will be coordinated by GIOC, for
gas pipelines by GGIC, and for non-pipeline oil spill issues by the Ministry of Environment. However,
given the complex nature of transit agreements, these designated core agencies will interact with numerous
other agencies in implementation of the project. Some consultancy contracts under the project will be
shared by GIOC and GGIC, and a steering committee has been established to ensure coordination (see
Section E.4). The Steering Committee is also intended to serve as a forum for interagency coordination
beyond implementation of the proposed project.
Project implementation is estimated to last four years. This estimate is based on expectations of
the date at which pipeline operations might commence. On current expectations, the assistance planned
under the proposed project will be needed from early 2001, and hence the project should not be delayed.
However, the evolution of project implementation is subject to considerable uncertainty, given the complex
nature of the pipeline investment decisions.
A mid-term review early in the project life (June 2002) will assess actual implementation of
pipeline investments against this background of uncertainty. Any project component which has not
progressed by this time will be subject to restructuring or cancellation. In addition, most contracts under
the project will be time-based, which will mitigate the risk that pipeline investmnents do not progress as
anticipated.
Financial Management System. Project Accounting: The PIU will establish and maintain project
accounts and adequate control procedures that facilitate timely and transparent reporting in accordance
with the Bank's Financial Accounting, Reporting and Auditing Handbook (FARAH), published in January
1995, and by other pertinent Bank guidelines, including the Bank's Loan Administration Change Initiative
(LACd). Project accounts are computerized and are maintained using "Peach Tree" software package, and
the PIU may continue to use the existing accounting software, customizing it, as needed, to track all
financial and procurement activities for the new project. Project accounting procedures will be designed to
facilitate the preparation of Project Management Reports (PMRs), although it is envisaged that the Project
will use traditional disbursement procedures.
Project Operational Manual (POM): A draft Project Operational Manual, including: accounting policies
and procedures, internal control routines and the audit arrangement to be used during project
implementation, was submitted to the Association for comments/review in January 2001. After review and
approval by the Association, the final Project Operational Manual will be available by February 28, 2001.
Audits: The PIU will prepare Project Financial Statements and quarterly Project Management Reports
(PMR) in a formnat compatible with the LACI format and in accordance with international accounting
standards. The project accounts will be audited each fiscal year in accordance with IDA guidelines by
independent auditors acceptable to the Association. The PIU will ensure that all project audits are
- 6 -



furnished to IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal year. The PIU intends to use the same auditor
which audits the other projects it manages and has recruited the auditor using single source selection. A
draft contract for the audit was submitted to the Association for review in January 2001, and it is expected
that the contract with the auditor will be signed immediately after credit effectiveness.
PIUAssessment: The PIU satisfies the Bank's minimum financial management requirements, and was
certified as 4B, although some enhancements are needed. An Action Plan was agreed upon and the PIU is
well on its way to meeting the key elements of the Action Plan to enable it to produce the required level of
financial management information on a timely basis.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Option 1: Leave this to other donors. The option of leaving the proposed assistance solely to
grant-based bilateral donors was considered. However, the Government values the political and
commercial neutrality of the Bank in this complex area, as well as the greater stakeholder involvement in
Bank selection procedures for consultants (an important issue for such strategic and sensitive tasks).
Donor funding for training will complement assistance under the proposed project.
Option 2: Address commercial issues also. The proposed project does not address commercial issues in
GIOC or GGIC (with the notable exception of rationalizing the quasi-fiscal revenues and dividend policies
of the two companies - see Section C.2.). These commercial issues have limited direct impact on the transit
pipeline advisory services GIOC and GGIC provide to the Government. Including such issues would
greatly increase project complexity, and risk substantially diminishing project ownership. In addition,
GIOC and GGIC have support from other donors to assist them in their commercial operations.
2. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed,
ongoing and planned).

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The main lessons learnt from previous Bank involvement in technical assistance for transit
pipelines in Georgia are: (i) there is a need for flexibility in project design to reflect considerable
uncertainty in pipeline implementation schedules; (ii) events can move very fast, and timely response is
essential; and (iii) Bank management involvement is critical, given political sensitivities.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The proposed project is a follow-on to the Oil Institution Building Project (which focused on oil
pipeline transit), the gas transit component of the Structural Reform Support Project, and the oil spill
component of the Integrated Coastal Management Project. The implementing agencies for those projects
(which are the same agencies as for the proposed project) have displayed consistent commitment to project
objectives. Bank involvement in transit pipelines has been strongly supported by President Shevardnadze
and other key members of the Government. The request for the proposed project was initially made by the
Georgian Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Regional Vice-President of ECA.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
Value-added derives from the Bank's regional overview of Caspian oil and gas developments, and
its international experience in large infrastructure projects (particularly the Bank's evolving experience in
social and environmental mitigation of pipeline projects). See Section D. 1. on the comparative advantage of
the Bank vis-a-vis other donors.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
O Cost benefit    NPV=US$ million; ERR = % (see Annex 4)
O Cost effectiveness
* Other (specify)
Institution-building projects do not lend themselves to quantification of economic and financial
returns. However, the economic returns to Georgia, and the financial/fiscal returns to the Government, are
expected to be considerable through the project's impact on the terms achieved by the State in negotiation
and implementation of transit agreements. In addition, the project supports greater transparency in the
operations of GIOC and GGIC, and the establishment of clear mechanisms for channeling quasi-fiscal
-8-



revenues to the Government budget.
2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR = % (see Annex 4)
see section E. 1
Fiscal Impact:
see section E. 1
3. Technical:
N/A
4. Institutional:
4.1 Executing agencies:
The Ministry of Environment, as the key agency responsible for environmental permitting,
monitoring, and enforcement will be intensively involved in the execution of the project. GIOC, as the
agency designated by the President, to coordinate oil transit pipeline issues, will oversee the oil pipeline
aspects of the project. Similarly, GGIC will oversee the gas transit pipeline aspects. The Ministry of
Finance will oversee the rationalization of financial relations between GoG, GIOC, and GGIC (see section
C.2), and will take a lead role on fiscal issues in pipeline transit negotiations.
4.2 Project management:
Procurement, financial management, and general oversight under the project will be handled by the
Project Implementation Unit currently implementing the technical assistance components of the Structural
Reform Support Project and the Judicial Reform Project, and one IDF Grant (the PIU is attached to the
Ministry of Economy, Industry and Trade). In the past the same PIU has managed the Institution Building
Project, SATAC I, SATAC II, and two IDF Grants. This PIU has seven years' experience implementing
Bank-financed projects involving multiple agencies, and has a proven track record.
A Steering Committee has been established to ensure coordination between the PIU and the
executing agencies (the PIU focusing on project management, and the executing agencies on technical
oversight). The Steering Commnittee will be composed of high level representatives from the Ministry of
Finance, Ministry of Environment, GIOC, GGIC and the PIU. The Steering Committee will establish
monthly activity schedules, and review implementation progress against those schedules.
4.3 Procurement issues:
The PIU will handle all procurement under the project (see 4.2). A procurement capacity
assessment of the PIU was completed in September 2000, and indicated that the procurement capacity of
the PIU is sound. More details of the review can be found in Annex 6.
4.4 Financial management issues:
The PIU will be responsible for all financial management under the project (see 4.2). Project
accounting procedures will be designed to facilitate preparation of PMRs, although it is envisaged that the
project will use the Bank's traditional disbursement procedures. A financial management capacity
assessment was carried out in September 2000, and the full report is available in Annex 6. The assessment
concluded that because the existing PIU has vast experience and a proven track record in implementing
-9-



Bank-financed projects, project management responsibilities can be given to the existing PIU, on condition
that the current level of staffing, with appropriate skills, be maintained. The project satisfies the Bank's
minimum financial management requirements, although some enhancements are needed. A timebound
Action Plan was agreed, which requires the PIU to design and implement an enhanced financial
management system by March 31, 2001, including the following actions, which were completed in January
2001: draft contract for the audit of the project and draft Project Operational Manual (POM) were
submitted to the Bank for review. Once this time-bound action plan is carried out successfully, the project
will have developed a financial management system capable of producing on a timely basis the required
level of financial management information.
5. Environmental:                Environmental Category: C (Not Required)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.
Since the project consists of technical assistance services, and scientific equipment related to
studies, the project is classified as a Category C. Neither an environmental assessment nor an EMP are
required. The project itself has a major environmental management focus by assisting in the review of the
environmental reports that will be submitted for construction of pipeline facilities. Under the project,
technical assistance to government agencies will be provided to ensure that adequate review of
environmental studies is carried out for the major oil and gas transit pipelines, and that compliance with
permitting requirements and liability legislation is effectively monitored. Public consultation and outreach
form an integral part of that process. For non-pipeline oil spill prevention, a separate project component of
technical assistance is included.
5.2 What are the main features of the EMP and are they adequate?
N/A
5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status of EA:
Date of receipt of final draft: N/A
5.4 How have stakeholders been consulted at the stage of (a) environmental screening and (b) draft EA
report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment management plan? Describe mechanisms
of consultation that were used and which groups were consulted?
N/A
5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project on the
environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results of the EMP?
N/A
6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
Actual pipeline construction and operation will involve right-of-way issues. The project will fund
technical assistance to mitigate the social impact of pipeline right-of-way issues (to ensure fair
compensation to landowners and neighboring communities, adequate govermmental review of investor
social impact assessments etc.).
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
Key government agencies have been intensively involved in project preparation, and will implement
the project. Advice of relevant private sector entities (particularly oil and gas companies) has been sought
- 10 -



during project design. Local consultants from the environmental community are expected to participate in
the provision of consultancy advice financed by the project. The project finances a consultative process for
environmental and social impact assessment, and includes subsequent public outreach.
6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
This technical assistance project will finance a process of stakeholder consultation as actual
pipeline investments advance.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes'?
Affected land owners need to be informed and assisted during the land acquisition phase which is
carried out by the pipeline investors. To ensure more inclusive participation in planning and decision
making, the project will include the following mechanisms: (a) distribution of land owners information
materials (i.e. model agreements for land evaluation and land acquisition) and local work session to inform
and prepare the affected land owners for the negotiation with the pipeline investors, (b)
strengthening/creation of capacity within the government and its implementing agencies to foster improved
dialogue and conflict resolution between land owners and pipeline investors, (c) providing access to public
documents concerning the legal arrangement (i.e. eminent domain) for land acquisition, and (d)
dissemination of the results of the EIA and SIA including public hearings.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance in terms of social development outcomes?
The social impact and social development outcomes resulting from pipeline investments will be
explicitly indicated in the Social Impact Assessment which is carried out by the pipeline investors. Due to
the nature of pipeline projects, a main indicator in the SIA process will be to assess the land evaluation
process and land ownership transfer. Therefore, priority will be given to monitoring the stakeholder
satisfaction with the land evaluation and negotiations process as well as monitoring of the public hearings.
The proposed Energy Transit Institution Building Project will fund disseminatioti of public
information concerning the proposed pipeline investments. In particular, it will finance legal and economic
guidelines concerning the land evaluation and land acquisition process, as well as guidelines for
participation in the public hearing process.
Monitoring, identification, and mitigation of social impacts will be a joint responsibility for
investors and the Government. Both activities will occur on an iterative basis throughout the project life
cycle. The terms of reference of the advisors financed by the project provide sufficient flexibility to deal
with monitoring of mitigation of unpredictable social impacts.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
It is critical to the sustainability of project benefits that transit pipelines retain high-level political
support in Georgia, but that political objectives do not overwhelm economic, social and environmental
considerations in order to ensure broad-based stakeholder ownership. It is important that state agencies
with divergent objectives (in particular GIOC and GGIC) manage to coordinate their activities. In addition,
the sustainability of project benefits will be enhanced if foreign investors in transit pipelines behave as good
corporate citizens.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
The project is unlikely to be controversial, even though the pipelines themselves can be expected to
be so. The pipelines give rise to geopolitical controversy, and social/environmental concerns; the project is
politically neutral between different pipeline options, and assists in the management of social/environmental
impacts.

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
GEORGIA: Energy Transit Institution Building
Background
Georgian cooperation with the World Bank Group over pipeline transit began in 1995. At that
time, the Government of Georgia and the Georgian International Oil Corporation (GIOC), the state agency
responsible for coordinating oil pipeline transit, requested financing on an urgent basis for short-term
advice in their "Early Oil" negotiations with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company over the
Baku-Supsa pipeline. GIOC was newly established, and Georgia was undertaking its first involvement in a
privately financed large infrastructure project. This collaborative effort with the Bank later developed into
a range of cooperation with the Bank Group to build institutions, enhance the policy framework, and to
finance investment in infrastructure.
In 1997, Georgia and the World Bank agreed on an Oil Institution Building Project. The Bank
credit financed a feasibility study of a potential Baku-Supsa major export pipeline (MEP), as well as
financial and legal advisors for MEP negotiations. The feasibility study covered economic, financial, legal,
engineering and environmental issues, and provided GIOC with substantial training in those disciplines. It
also involved the extensive use of Georgian consultants (particularly environmental scientists) alongside
international experts, ensuring that local knowledge was incorporated and that technology was effectively
transferred. In addition, a National Oil Spill Contingency Plan is being prepared under the Integrated
Coastal Management Project financed by the Netherlands Government. The final report is available.
The training provided by the Baku-Supsa feasibility study helped to prepare GIOC for the
negotiations of the Baku-Thilisi-Ceyhan Intergovermnental and Host Government Agreements (the Oil IGA
and Oil HGA respectively). This was complemented by internationally experienced negotiation advisors.
The Georgian Government and GIOC were thus able to formulate negotiating positions in a better-informed
manner than had been the case for Early Oil.
The law on eminent domain allowed Georgia to negotiate provisions in the Baku-Thilisi-Ceyhan
HGA that significantly reduce the Government's cost exposure in acquisition of land or access rights for the
pipeline corridor. Those provisions in the HGA, and the new law on eminent domain, should ensure that the
pipeline investors will adequately compensate private landowners whose land is needed for that corridor.
The law on transportation of hazardous substances ensures that polluters pay for any pollution. It imposes
"strict" liability on a pipeline operator, such that the operator is obliged to clean up oil spills and
compensate for damage, even if that damage were caused by a third party (the operator can then seek
restitution from the third party). The law should ensure that pollution is cleaned up quickly, and that parties
suffering loss can claim compensation. The law's provisions were incorporated in the Oil HGA.
Georgia and the Bank have also cooperated in gas pipeline transit. The Structural Reform Support
Project has provided funding for fmancial and legal advisors for the Georgian Gas International
Corporation (GGIC, the state agency responsible for coordinating gas pipeline transit) to better assist the
Government in transit negotiations.
Within the framework of the Energy Transit Institution Building Project technical, environmental
and legal advisors are required to provide support and enhance the capacity of the Georgian Government to
implement Oil and Gas transit agreements in a manner that maximizes economic benefit, ensures that
design, construction and operation of the facilities are in compliance with international technical and
environmental standards and best practices, and minimizes social impacts. For effective and targeted

assistance the ETIB includes five individual project components:
By Component:
Project Component I - US$8.40 million
Environmental and Technical Advice for Pipeline Implementation will include consultancy services to
assist the Government in fulfilling its implementation obligations under oil and gas pipeline transit
agreements on a timely basis (Georgia incurs substantial liabilities if there are delays against very short
deadlines in the agreements). These services will focus on reviewing environmental/social impact
assessments, permitting, compliance monitoring, and public outreach. The component will thus go beyond
environmental impact assessment, and will strengthen long-term environmental management capacity.This
will involve environmental, public communications, social and technical consultants (international and
local) to address East-West oil and gas transit implementation issues jointly. The environmental and
technical (route selection) advisors will be under separate, but complementary, terms of reference. This
project component will also include technical/environmental advisors for negotiations of transit of gas
North-South from Russia (technical advisors for East-West gas transit negotiations have been provided by
USTDA).
A) The scope of work for environmental advisors on the East-West oil and gas pipelines includes
several elements to support the GoG (and its implementing agencies) to: (i) fulfill its environmental and
social review obligations under the IGAs and HGAs; (ii) monitor the public review process for the
EIA/SIA, and facilitate widespread public participation and information dissemination; (iii) ensure that
international standards and best practice in respect to the EIA and SIA are applied; (iv) provide support in
continuing negotiations with the pipeline investors/sponsors conceming additional environmental and social
issues which may arise during the implementation phase; and (v) carry out a training program which is
targeted to build institutional capacity in respect to the EIA and SIA review process.
In more detail the Terms of Reference include but are not limited to:
1.     Assist the Government of Georgia to fulfill its "environmental review" obligations under transit
agreements on a timely basis. (Georgia incurs substantial liabilities if there are delays against very short

Main assumptions:
Since the technical assistance financed by the Project deals with specific issues arising as the pipelines are
implemented, e.g., review of an Environmental Impact Assessment, which would be a one-time review, the
costs are not expected to continue beyond the implementation period, so no expenses have been estimated for
the operational period.
Identifiable taxes, estimated at US$2.15 million, are not included.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
GEORGIA: Energy Transit Institution Building
Procurement
The services of consultants and goods will be procured in accordance with the latest edition of the
Bank's Guidelines. The project activities not financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with the
national regulations. The project elements, their estimated cost and procurement methods are summarized
in Tables A and Al. The thresholds for each procurement method and Bank prior review (including
aggregate values) are shown in Table B. A procurement plan detailing the packaging and estimated
schedule of the major procurement actions is presented in Table B 1. All other procurement information,
including capability of the implementing agency, estimated dates for publication of GPN and the Bank's
review process is presented in Table B2.
Goods
Goods (approximately US$660,000 ) consisting of environmental monitoring and office
equipment will be procured through Intemational Shopping, as per the paras. 3.5 and 3.6 of the Guidelines.
Consulting Services
Contracts for Consulting Services (US$8.30 million) will be awarded for technical and
environmental advisory services, non-pipeline oil spill mitigation advisory services, training, auditor's
services (firms) and legal services (individuals). The following methods of selection will be followed:
(a) Quality-and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) procedures will be used for consultant's services
with firms (except auditors) estimated to cost more than $100,000.
(b) Least-Cost Selection (LCS) will be used for auditors' services (company audits) and training.
(c) Individual Consultants Selection will be used for legal advisors for GGIC and GIOC and for
smaller miscellaneous advisors;
(d) Single Source Selection, for an amount not to exceed US$100,000, will be used for the audit
of the project accounts, using the same auditors the PIU has already contracted to audit the other projects it
manages.
Notification of Business Opportunities
A General Procurement Notice (GPN) was published in the June 16, 2000 issue of Development
Business. For consultants' contracts above US$200,000 a Request for Expressions of Interest will be
advertised in Development Business (in the English Language) and in a major local newspaper (in English
and in the national language).
Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions
Prior review:
(a) Goods: As there will be only minor procurement of goods, the prior review will be conducted
for the first two contracts.
(b) Consulting Services: Terms of reference for all consulting assignments will be subject to prior
review by IDA. Terms of reference for legal services will also be reviewed by IDA's Legal Department.
Requests for Proposals (RFP) short lists, terms and conditions of contracts as well as evaluation reports
and recommendations for award will be prior reviewed by IDA for contracts for individual consultants
above $50,000 and furms above $100,000.
After award of contract, should any material modifications or waiver of terms and conditions of a
contract result in an increase above 15% of the original amount, IDA will reserve the right to prior review
- 31 -



of such modifications (including modifications to contracts for consulting services).
Ex-post review: All tenders, not subject to prior review, are subject to Bank ex-post review. All
documentation, including, but not limited to: TOR, bidding documents or requests for proposals, bids or
proposals received, correspondence on all bids either prior to or following award of contract including IDA
no objections, contracts and any subsequent amendments should be maintained until at least six months
following the close of the Project.

Explain briefly the Procurement Monitoring System:
All procurement related documentation that requires Bank's prior review will be cleared by Procurement Accredited Staff (PAS) and relevant technical
staff.
Packages above mandatory review thresholds will be reviewed by RPA. The PIU will maintain complete procurement files which will be reviewed by
Bank's supervision missions. The Procurement Plan will be
updated semi-annually. Procurement information will be recorded by the PIU and submitted to the Bank as part of the quarterly and annual progress
reports.
This information will include: revised
cost estimates for the different contracts; revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time
for individual contracts; as well as compliance
with aggregate limits specific methods of procurement. A Management Information System (MIS) consisting of an accounting system capable
of prodticing project management
reports and Microsoft Project for maintaining procurement schedules will be used by the PIU to monitor procurement process.

Total                                       9.63          _
Note: Incremental operating costs of the implementing agencies (GIOC, GGIC and Ministry of
Environmnent), estimated at US$0.41 million, are being bome by those agencies as their contribution to the
project.
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
Some of the proceeds of the credit are expected to be disbursed on the basis of Statements of Expenditures
( SOEs) as follows: (a) goods costing less than US$100,000 equivalent for each contract; (c) services
contracts for (i) individuals costing less than US$50,000 equivalent each; (ii) firms costing less than
US$100,000 equivalent each; and (d) PIU's incremental operating costs. Disbursements against goods and
services exceeding the above limits will be made against full documentation and respective procurement
guidelines. Related documentation in support of SOEs will not be submitted to IDA, but will be retained
by the PIU for at least one year, after receipt by IDA of the audit report for the year in which the last
disbursement is made. This documentation will be made available for review by the auditors and IDA
supervision missions. If ineligible expenditures, including those not justified by the evidence furnished, or
amounts in excess of agreed disbursement percentages are financed from the Special Account (SA), IDA
will have the right to withhold further deposits in the SA. IDA may exercise this right until the Borrower
has: (a) refunded the amounts involved, or (b) (if IDA agrees) submitted evidence of other eligible
expenditures that the Bank can use to offset the ineligible amounts.
Special account:
To facilitate timely project implementation, the PIU will establish, maintain and operate, under terms and
conditions acceptable to IDA, a Special Account, denominated in US Dollars, in a bank acceptable to IDA.
During the early stage of the project, the initial aggregate authorized allocation of the Special Account
would be limited to $480,000. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the credit have reached
US$1.4 million, the initial allocation of the Special Account may be increased up to the authorized
allocation of US$960,000 by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal. The minimum amount
- 38 -



of each application should be 20% of the authorized allocation. The PIU has extensive experience in this
activity and it should not pose any problem. Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would
be submitted monthly, or whenever one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, and must include
reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents.
The Borrower will be responsible for the appropriate accounting of the funds provided by the Bank under
the Loan, for reporting on the use of these funds, and for ensuring that audits of the financial statements or
reports are submitted to the Bank. A computerized accounting system has been established at the PIU.
Financial Management Capacity Assessment
The financial management review was carried out during September 2000.
The project is a Technical Assistance Credit ($10.14 million total cost, net of taxes) which aims to enhance
the capacity of the Georgian State to negotiate and implement oil and gas transit agreements to maximize
economic benefits, and minimize social and environmental costs. The project has five components: (i)
Environmental and Technical Advice for Pipeline Implementation; (ii) Legal Advice for Pipeline
Implementation; (iii) Company Audits for GIOC and GGIC; (iv) Non-pipeline Oil Spill Prevention and
Mitigation; and (v) Project Implementation.
The technical implementation of project components for (i) oil pipelines will be handled by Georgian
International Oil Corporation (GIOC); (ii) for gas pipelines by Georgian Gas Implementation Corporation
(GGIC), and (iii) for non-pipeline oil spill issues by the Ministry of Environment.
The financial management and general oversight of the project will be handled by the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) which is currently implementing the technical assistance component of the
Structural Reform Support Project and the Judicial Reform Project and one IDF Grant. In the past, the
same PIU also managed Institutional Building Project, SATAC I, SATAC II, and two IDF Grants. The
PIU has over seven years of experience implementing IDA-financed projects involving multiple agencies,
and has a proven track record.
Steering Committee:
To facilitate, manage, and coordinate all contractual activities under the project, a Steering Committee has
been established. The committee will have representatives from GIOC, GGIC, Ministry of Environment,
Ministry of Finance and the PIU. Meetings were held with the heads/representatives of the above agencies
to confirm that project coordinators were identified from each agency.
Capacity of PIU:
The PIU has five full time staff as follows:
(i)    Head PIU;
(ii)   Chief Accountant;
(iii)  Disbursement Specialist;
(iv)   Procurement Specialist;
(v)    Senior Procurement Specialist.
The above team has vast experience in managing World Bank projects. Staff have attended several WB
- 39 -



sponsored seminars in procurement and disbursements in Tbilisi, Washington, and London. The chief
accountant and the disbursement specialist also received accounting (IAS) training from Georgia Audit, a
local firm.
PIU Office Space/Equipment:
The project under consideration intends to use the existing PIU facility that was set up under other ongoing
projects. The PIU has adequate equipment. Each staff has PC with Pentium processor and MS-Office
software installed. All PCs, except that of chief accountant, are connected with the local area network.
Project accounts are computerized and are maintained using 'Peach Tree' software package. For the safety
of accounting records and supporting documentation, the PIU is also equipped with a safe deposit box.
The PIU also has a back-up system and has a generator in case of power blackouts.
Needfor New Accounting Software and Financial Reporting:
It is not considered necessary for the PIU to purchase any new accounting software package. The PIU may
use the existing accounting software, customizing it, as needed, to track all financial and procurement
activities for the new project. The PIU will be responsible for all financial management under the project.
Project accounting procedures will be designed to facilitate the preparation of Project Management Reports
(PMRs), although it is envisaged that the Project will use traditional disbursement procedures. The PIU
accountant, who is already preparing PMRs (for other ongoing projects) will be responsible for preparing
and maintaining all disbursement records and furnishing financial management reports to IDA not later
than 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter.
Project Operational Manual (POM):
It was agreed with the PIU Head and Chief Accountant that a Project Operational Manual will be prepared
that would include: accounting policies and procedures, internal control routines, and the audit arrangement
used during project implementation. A good-practice sample (electronic version) of POM was left with the
PIU accountant who prepared a draft manual and submitted it to IDA for its review in January 2001. After
review and approval by the IDA, the final Project Operational Manual will be available not later than
February 28, 2001.
Auditing Arrangements:
The Project financial statements, special account, and the SOEs will be audited annually by a private
sector, independent auditor, in accordance with standards acceptable to the IDA and in accordance with
the Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (FARAH).
GIOC and GGIC will also submit their annual audited financial statements. The draft contract with the
auditors for the audit of the project accounts was submitted to IDA for review in January 2001. The
contract will be signed once the credit becomes effective.
Special Account:
To facilitate timely project implementation, the PIU will establish, maintain and operate, under terms and
conditions acceptable to IDA, a Special Account, denominated in US Dollars. The PIU has extensive
experience in this activity and it should not pose a problem. Applications for replenishment of the Special
Account would be submitted monthly, or whenever one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever
occurs earlier.

Conclusion:
In the 1999 Corruption Perception Index (published by Transparency International), Georgia was ranked as
#84 out of 99 countries. This index relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business
people, risk analysts and the general public and ranges between 10 (highly clean) and 0 (highly corrupt).
Georgia's score on this scale was 2.3. Even though the two beneficiary companies operate in a business
environment with a high degree of perceived corruption, the centralization of project management and
administrative functions -- and related flow of funds -- within the PIU, whose accounting, financial
reporting and internal control procedures are documented in a Project Operational Manual approved by
IDA prior to Board presentation, together with standard external auditing arrangements, would contribute
to mitigate the fiduciary risks associated to the project, which can be judged as being acceptable.
The Project satisfies the Association's minimum financial management requirements, although some
enhancements are needed. An Action Plan is presented below which requires PIU to design and implement
satisfactory financial management system. Once this time-bound Action Plan is carried out successfully, it
is believed that the project will, by then, have developed a financial management system that will be able to
produce the required level of financial management information on a timely basis.
