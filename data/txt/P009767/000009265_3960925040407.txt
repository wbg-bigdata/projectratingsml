SECOND SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(CREDIT 1027-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Singrauli
Thermal Power Project in India, for which Credit 1027-IN in the amount of
US$300 million was approved on May 22, 1980. The credit was closed on June
30, 1989, one year and three months behind schedule. It was fully disbursed
and the last disbursement was on March 15, 1990. Cofinancing in the amount of
DM 240 million was provided by Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of Federal
Republic of Germany.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Transport and Energy Operations
Divisicns, Country Department IV (India) and the Energy Division, Technical
Department, both of the Asia Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary,
Part I and III). The Borrower did not prepare Part II as requested.
Preparation of this PCR was started by the Borrower during the
Association's Supervision Mission in October, 1989. Subsequently, based on
the revised guidelines for PCRs, a fresh draft was begun on arrival of the
Association's final Supervision Mission in February 1990, and is based,
inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 2745b-IN), the Credit and
Project Agreements, supervision reports, correspondence between IDA and the
Borrower and internal IDA memoranda.

SECOND SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(CREDIT 1027-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Objectives
The two main objectives of the project were: (i) to provide the
National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) assistance to construct two 200 MW
and two 500 MW coal fired thermal power generating units as the second stage
of NTPC's Singrauli Thermal Power Project to mitigate power shortages in the
Northern Region Interconnected system of India and (ii) to assist the
Government of India (GOI) in achieving its objective of further advancing the
regional and national integration of the power subsector (Part I, paras. 2 and
3).
Implementation Experience
NTPC successfully implement.d the project.  The first 200 MW unit
(Unit No. 4) was commissioned three months behind schedule and the second 200
MW unit (Unit No. 5) was commissioned as scheduled.  The two 500 MW units
which were NTPC's first pithead coal fired 500 MW units were commissioned 10
months (Unit No. 6) and 9 months (Unit No. 7) behind schedule after overcoming
many difficulties (Part I, paras. 11 and 14).
Results
The project fully achieved its main objectives through successful
completion of two 200 MW and two 500 MW units of the second stage of Singrauli
station and associated 400 kV transmission lines. Following this completion,
and with the addition of the three 200 MW units built within the first stage,
the Singrauli fhermal Station became the first of the 2,000 MW class coal
K          fired thermal stations of NTPC and, at that time, the largest power station in
the country.
NTPC's financial rate of return on historically valued net fixed
assets for the last four years was between 14? and 172 against the covenanted
rate of return of 9.5? for the period FY89 and beyond. The economic rate of
return of the project was about 20? against the estimated figure of 102 (Part
I, paras. 18, 22 and 31).
Sustainability
The operational efficieuicy of NTPC in this power station as well as
in other NTPC plants is good in spite of the continuing high growth rate of
the utility, and thus contributes to sustaining the benefits from the projects
NTPC carries out (Part I, paras. 23 to 26).

Findings and Lessons Learned
Major finding was as follows:
(a)  The project management and construction management of NTPC
executed the project very competently and were "forced,"
through actual experience, to construct the first 2,000 MW
coal fired plant, including two 500 MW units, which were
being installed in India for the first time. (Part I,
para. 29).
Major lessons learned were as follows:
(a)  To improve implementation performance and consequently to
accelerate disbursements, key actions should be taken up-
front.  In the case of this project, the project
consultants should 2-.ve been requested to be appointed as
early as possible, id.t-lly before negotiations. Similarly,
by the time the credit was presented to the Board, the bid
documents should have been ready. (Part I, para. 13).
(b)  The Association could have been more forceful in seeking
NTPC's compliance with the receivables covenant, a critical
element to ensure NTPC's liquidity. (Part I, para 31).
(c)  Similarly, the Association could have been more convincing
in its efforts to improve the revenue covenant. (Part I,
para 31).
(d)  The Association should have acted earlier in identifying
remedies to alleviate the environmental and resettlement
problems and having them implemented by the authorities,
and in enhancing NTPC's ability to address adequately
environmental and resettlement matters. In this context,
the implementation of the Environmental Action Plan agreed
within the proposed Regional Power Systems Project should
be monitored by the Bank very closely (Part I, paras. 15 to
17).

Subsector          : Power
Background
1.       Power shortages of the 1970s and the adverse effect these were having
on the productive sectors of the economy prompted the Government of India
(GOI) to intensify its efforts to balance the demand and supply of
electricity. The strategy of the GOI was to supplement efforts of State
Electricity Boards (SEBs) in increasing installed capacity and the
establishment of high voltage transmission lines. Emphasis was laid in the
power subsector in: (a) accelerating the development of the hydropower
potential and large coal fired power plants at both pithead locations and in
the proximity of load centers; (b) improving the efficiency of thermal power
plants and reducing losses in the transmission and distributionl networks;
(c) expanding the rural electrification program; and (d) strengthening the
organizational and management capabilities of the SEBs. In 1974 GOI decided
to proceed with the construction of the first stage of four large thermal
power stations of 600 MW each at Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka,
located near coal fields and supplying bulk power to the beneficiaries through
interconnected 400 kV transmission systems. GOI established in 1975 two power
generating companies, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and the
National Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC) to construct and operate large thermal
and hydro power stations and associated transmission systems. The feasibility
study of the Singrauli project was prepared by NTPC in 1978 and the project
appraisal was made by the Association in 1979.
Project Objectives
2.       The primary objectives of the project were to:  (a) provide NTPC with
assistance needed to assume its envisaged role, including the mitigation of
power shortages in the Northern Region of India; and (b) assist GOI in
achieving its objective of further advancing the regional and ultimately the
national integration of the power subsector.
Project Description
3.       The Second Singrauli Thermal Power Project (Credit 1027-IN) formed
part of NTPC's second stage thermal power aevelopment located on the fringe of
the Rihand Reservoir close to the Singrauli coal field deposits in the State
of Uttar Pradesh and consisted of the installation of two 200 MW and two 500



- 2 -
MW mine-mouth thermal power generating units and associated transmission
facilities, including the followirg components:
(a) Two 700 tonnes/hour boilers and two 200 MW turbogenerating units
complete with all a.xiliaries and ancillary electrical and mechanical
equipment including switchyard; and
(b) Tvo 1,700 tonnes/hour boilers and two 500 MW turbogenerating units
complete with all auxiliaries and ancillary electrical and mechanical
equipment including switchyard;
(c) 400 kV Alternating Current (AC) Transmission System consisting of
1,826 kms of lines 1/ and complete with all auxiliaries and ancillary
electrical and mechanical equipment including switchyard.
Acquisition of steel for structural works, cement and reinforcement
steel under the scope of NTPC's ongoing other projects, was subsequently
included under the scope of this project in 1986.
Project Design and Organization
4.       As in the case of the first stage, the expansion phase of Singrauli
Development comprised a number of major works (including NTPC's first two 500
MW units) and required careful coordination to ensure efficient progress.
Much of the detailed power station engineering and design work had been
carried out for the first stage. NTPC had already acquired adequate
experience in the area of design and engineering of 200 MW units, especially
from the first stage of the Singrauli power plant, and therefore there was no
need to appoint consultants for the 200 MW units. As for coal fired 500 MW
units, which were being installed for the first time in India, a consultant
was employed by NTPC to assist in the design, the preparation of
specifications and bidding documents, the evaluation of bids and the project
management for part of the project covering the two 500 MW units.
5.       Under the first Singrauli project, GOI agreed to take necessary steps
to make available adequate coal supplies for the 2,000 MW power plant. Coal
supply has so far not hindered the operation of all units.
6.       The project was prepared and timed by the Association in a manner to
enable the Borrower to reduce the gap between the demand and supply of power
in the Northern Region Interconnected System, as well as to further strengthen
the institutional developmient of NTPC.
I/ 400 kV transmission lines consisted of the following circuits:
(Circuit km)
Singrauli  - Lucknow                    402           (470)
Lucknow    - Moradabad                  322            (330)
Moradabad  - Muradnagar                 132            (150)

Kanpur      - Agra-Jaipur               500            (475)
Total:                         1,826          (1,975)
Figures in parentheses show estimation at the time of appraisal.



7.       At the time of appraisal, NTrC had ad3pted a two-tier organizational
structure--one at the central/corporate~± level and the otner at the project
sites.  Technical services, contract and procu:ement services and quality
assurance, etc. were centralized. For each of four power plants, a project
crganization group under the control of a General Manager was organized to
manage the implementation of the particular project.
8.       NTPC was recrganized, subsequently, after the appraisal to have a
three-tier organizational structure:
(1) Corporate level;
(2) Regional level; and
(3)  Project level.
9.       The Corporation is headed by a Chairman and Managing Director (CMD),
who is assisted by five full-time functional Directors, namely, Director
(Projects), Director (Operation), Director (Technical), Director (Finance) and
Director (Personnel). At the Corporate Office, corporate planning, central
procurement and vigilance functions are headed by Executive Directors
reporting to the CMD. For the purpose of the administration and execution of
work at the sites, the Corporation is divided into five regions (North, West,
East South and National Capital) whose headquarters are at present located at
Allahabad, Nagpur, Patna, Hyderabad and Delhi, respectively. These regions
are under the control of Regional Executive Directors whc are responsible for
the implementation and operation and maintenance of power plants and
transmission systems iL their respective regions. Ev3ry power piant and
regional transmission unit is headed by a General Manager.
10.      The new structure has the advantage of reducing and optimizing the
span of control of the CMD. The structure provides for decentralization of
line responsibility while retaining centralized systems in areas such as long-
term planning, basic engineering, procurement of critical equipment and
spares, quality assurance, co-ordination with the World Bank and other
financing agencies, inspection, etc.
Project Implementation
11.      The fi.rst 200 MW unit (Unit No. 4) was commissioned in November 1983,
three months behind the original schedule and the second 200 MW unit (Unit No.
5) was commissioned in February 1984 as scheduled. (Dates of commissioning at
the appraisal estimate were August, 1983 and February, 1984 respectively.)
The three months' slippage for the No. 4 unit was largely on account of
cyclonic damage caused to tower crane in May, 1982 which hampered the physical
progress of the boiler erection. Subsequently, the project management group
performed well to opt.imize utilization of available resources and preventing
further delay. The boiler erection work was efficiently managed by use of
mobile cranes and winches. The No. 5 unit was commissioned as planned in
February, 1984.
12.      The first 500 MW unit (Unit No. 6) had been planned for commissioning
in February, 1986, followed by the second unit (Unit No. 7) one year
thereafter (February, 1987), whereas the actual commissioning took place in
December, 1986 and November, 1987 respectively.
13.      The selection and appointment of the consultants for the 500 MW units
took more time than envisaged at the appraisal stage. Instead of September,
1979 as forecast in the SAR, the actual appointment was done in April, 1980.



Consequently, in order to allow for review of technical specificationg for
steam generator package, the Notice for Invitation to Bids was released only
in December, 1980, thirteen months later than the scheduled d'ate of November,
1979 (SAR), and the contract was awarded in January, 1982 instead of May, 1980
(SAR).
14.      Considering the implementation of India's first coal fired 500 MW
units involving 70,000 cu m. of concreting work, 32,000 MT of structurel steel
erection. 79,000 MT Boiler parts erection, 30 kms of piring and 3,400 kms of
cable work with peak manpower of 11,000, not to mention the numerous problems
faced in the field, e.g.. transportaticn damage to boiler ceiling girder, use
of specially designed rail trolley wagons for generator stations, etc., the
slippage of 10 months may be considered reasorable.
Environment, Resettlement and Rehabilitation
15.      The project was designed to comply with the applicable environmental
quality standards prevalent in India at that time. The increasing demand for
electricity in India has required the construction of either large
hydroelectric schemes or coal-fired thermal power stations, most of them
located close to associated open cast coal mines, which in general have an
important impact on the surrounding communities and on the balance of
ecological systems. The Singraufi regional area i.s a particular case in point
-- and has been labeled 'The Energy Capital of India." The association of
extensive coal reserves and a large water reservoir, created in the 1960s
following the construction of the Rihand dam for the purpose of power
generation and irrigation, has favored the implementation of several thermal
power stations - six at present totaling around 7,200 MW and more are either
under construction or planned, - as well as other industries (i.e., seven
cement plants, an aluninum smelting and a chemical plant) and the development
of several coal mines. Although the region was rather arid and sparsely
populated, rapid industrial development, the lack of basic infrastructure, and
the absence of coordination between different public administrations - the
Singrauli area lies on the border of two states, Uttar Pradesh azid Madhya
Pradesh - have exacerbated the impact on the indigenous population as well as
on the process of industrial urbanization. The deteriorating situation has
been a source of serious concern as.:eng local, national and international
environmv-%talists.
16.      The implementation ot the Project, including the expansion phase of
1400 MW, required the acquisition of 1,901 hectares (4,752 acres) resulting in
compensation of 1,450 families affecting 15 villages. Part of the required
area, located at about eight km from the plant, was needed for dumping the
ash. A limited number of shops were also allotted to oustees in the NTPC
sh:-pping complex. NTPC has also provided civil amenities in the relocation
colonies, including medical facilities, periodic visits by medical officers
and preventive check up, public health is increasingly deteriorating in the
colonies, partly as a result of a larger squatter settlement, which has grown
around the area. Limited rnmbers of oustees were given employment and on-the-
job training by NTPC, and employed through various contractor3 working for the
projec;.. However, no employment opportunities have been provided to a
majority of the oustees, because of their low level of skills. However, it
has to be recognized that there are limits to NTPC's ability to resolve all
the environmental issues associated with a power developmen. -project and that
the local government authorities should be responsible for the public



- 5-
infrastructure needed in the context of a large project deve.apment. NTPC has
also t'.keri appropriate measures with regard to stack emissions and water
effluents.  They regularly monitor these aspects of environmental protection
and comply so far fully with environmental quality 3tandards prescribed by the
Government. In addition, through a continuous afforestation program, a large
nuzioer of trees of various species have been planted and this will be expanded
in the future, notably in order to rehabilitate the ash pond area.
17.      As a result of problems encountered and experience gained in
Singrauli, as well as in other projects, including the Bank-financed Korba,
Ramagundam and Farakka thermal-power plants, the Bank encourabed NTPC. to
become more aware oc the particular complexities associated with environmental
and especially -ith resettlement issues.  The recent projects -- e.g. the
Talcher Thermal Power Pioject (Ln. 2845-IN) and the proposed NTPC-Regional
Power Systems Project -- the approach has been from the beginning more
comprehensire. In the Talcher project a detailed environmental impact
assessment was prepared prior to beginning the construction works. In the
case of the proposed NTPC-Regional Power Systems Project, NTPC first recruited
staff specialized in social and environmental sciences and then undertook a
review of the environmental aspects at the four above-mentioned Bank-financed
power stations in order to Implement corrective measures to adequately
rehabilitate and preserve the physical and social environment in those areas
affected by these proiects. To achieve this, NTPC has prepared an
Environmental Action Plan (EAP) addressing aspects related to:
(i) preparation of Environment Impact Assessments for existing and future
projects; (ii) resettlement and improvement of living conditions of the
displaced population, and (iii) development of afforestation plans. In
Singrauli, an element of the EAP is the Regional Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) financed by the Bank dnd presently being carried out by
consultants. In addition to the Singrauli power plant, the Regional EIA also
covers the 1000 MW Rihand and 1200 MW Vindhychal thermal power stations, which
are owned and operated by NTPC in this area. The purpose of the study is to
identify critical environmental factors and exarine alternative ways to
mitigate them. It is expected that the Regional EIA would be completed by
February 1991. The recommendations of the EIA will be inco-porated into the
EAP.
Project Results
18.      The project fully achieved its main objectives of meeting growing
demand of Northern Region through successful completion of additional power
generation of 1,400 MW and associated 400 kV transmission lines. As a result
of completion, the Singrauli Thermal Station has become the first 2,000 MW
class coal-fired thermal power station among four projects which were assigned
to NTPC under the power expansion plan identified by GOI in 1974. The
cumulative generation from Singrauli II units, from the beginning of
commercial operation up to June 30, 1989 (the date at which the credit wab
closed) was 24,064 GWh. The unit details are given in Part III.
19.      The estimated cost of the project at appraisal and actual
disbursements is given in Part III. The appraisal cost estimate of
Rs. 8,20Q.0 million had increased to Rs. 10,668.40 million representing 302
increase. An increase of Rs 1,356.3 million was due to price escalation and
Rs 652.8 million due to change in scope for power stationi facilities. The
increase of Rs 35.7 million was due to change in price of transmission
facilities while Rs 306.1 million change was due to scope change in price of



transmission lines. The remainiing increase of Rs 108.5 million was on account
of engineering, administration, consulting, interest during construction and
working capital requirements.2/   The price escalation was mostly due to the
increase in foreign exchange rate for the dollar which went up Rs 8.4 per US$
at the time of appraisal to around Rs 15 per USS when the project was
completed. When considering the total project cost estimates in dollar value,
however, they amount to US$977.2 million in the appraisal and US$927.7 million
actually, rest.lting in a decrease of 5X, due to the rapid decrease of the
rupee value against the dollar. The average exchange rate for the period of
disbursement from the IDA credit vas Rs 11.5 per USS (para. 34), resulting in
a depreciation of about 35% in the value of Indian Rupees to US dollars.
Thirty percent was reflected in the project cost expressed in local currency
and 5% was reflected in the decrease of costs expressed in U.S. dollars.
20.       The estimated disbursements at appraisal and actual disbursements are
given in Part III. The original closing date of the Credit was March, 1988.
Actually the Credit was closed on June 30, 1989, one year and three months
behind schedule. Disbursements against commitments were made until March 15,
1990.
21.       The allocation of the Credit into various categories and actual
disbursement by category is shown in Part III.
22.       In the SAR, the e.-ante internal economic rate of return (IERR) for
the project was estimated at about 13 percent, based on measurable ecjnomic
costs and benefits associated with the 1,400 MW development. In the SAR for
the Singrauli first phase (Credit No. 685), the ex-ante IERR associated with
overall 2,000 MW development was estimated at 10 percent. The ex-post IERR
for the 2,000 MW development is about 20 percent as shown in Annex 1.
Project Sustainability
23.      As in most power projects, the economic evaluation of the project in
both the SAR and the PCR, uses revenues from sales as a proxy for economic
benefits and therefore does not give a full picture of all the benefits.
Further, sustainability of benefits from power projects is closely linked to
that of the sector and of the utility. Therefore, in the present context, it
has to be ascertained in a rather qualitative way, through the factors that
affect it.
24.       The political and economic environment has been stable and is
expected to continue to be so. For many years there have been shortages in
the supply of electricity. These are likely to persist, because, although GOI
is strongly committed to the development of the power sector as one of the
bases for both industrial and rural development, the Government is not in
position to allocate the full amount of funds the sector would require to meet
the demand. The unresolved discrepancies between the states' and GOI's
positions concerning the organization and the roles of the various entities of
the sector may tend to lead to economically sub-optimal solutions, but not to
an extent that they would endanger sustainability of benefits from existing
facilities, in general, and from the Singrauli power plant, in particular.
25.       The institutional let up of the sector is progressing, albeit slowly,
towards a structure c3mbining as muc.'. as possible regionalization of
2/ Including increase of working capital requirements of NTPC (Rs 99.9
million), which were not taken into account in the appraisal.



operations with countrywide optimization of the use of resources. There is
still a long way to go to achieve such optimization.
26.      The project was successful in that all the four units were completed
satisfactorily and are generating the much needed electricity for the Northern
Region. NTPC's capacity in designing and implementing 200 MW units was
strengthened and successfully tested, while the Corporation obtained its know-
how in the design and implementation of 500 MW units. Operational efficiency
of Singrauli and NTPC's other power plants and transmission system is good in
spite of the continuous high growth rate of the utility and thus contributes
to sustaining benefits from the projects NTPC carries out. Strengthening of
NTPC's project design, implementation, operation and maintenance capabilities
together with the realization of successfully operating 1400 MW additional
operating capacity are indicators that show that benefits from the project
would be sustained over the long-term.
IDA Performance
27.      The performance of the A;sociation from the project preparation
through project completion was satisfactory. The Association maintained good
relations with the beneficiary throughout the execution of the project and
fostered an environment conducive to increased Bank Group involvement with
NTPC. To date, the Bank Group has assisted NTPC in implementing a total of 13
projects with a total assistance of about 4 billion dollars. Through these
operations the Bank Group has been strengthening the institutional and
financial viability of the corporation. It is important to highlight that,
during this initial decade of development, NTPC and the Bank Group developed a
close relationship, during which the Bank Group has endeavored to support NTPC
in each step of its development, in a manner that goes much beyond the
substantial financial assistance extended to its expansion plan.
28.      The Bank Group has also continued addressing a number of shortcomings
of broader sectoral concern. The major items are:
(a)  During the preparation of the recent projects, a more comprehensive
and up-front approach towards environmental protection, resettlement
and rehabilitation issues has been adopted and an Environmental
Action Plan, aimed to complement earlier efforts, has already been
drawn up for Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka projects, under
the recently negotiated NTPC-Regional Power Systems Project;
(b)  Implementation of an Action Plan to liquidate accumulation of arrears
receivable from SEBs; and
(c)  Development of the Power Management Institute (PMI) to provide
specialized training in management and other aspects of the power
sector.
Borrower Performance
29.      The performance of NTPC was generally commendable and met most of the
expectations of the appraisal report. Although some delays in procurement for
the 500 MW units were experienced as stated in para 13 Part I, the first 500
MW units in NTPC projects could be successfully completed under the well
established control of NTPC project management by encountering numerous
difficulties.



30.      As a direct outcome of development of Singrauli and other subsequent
projects, NTPC has made good progress in building up its organization and
manpower resources. NTPC had accorded special importance on the training of
engineers, and operating staff as well as managerial staff. This success of
NTPC's first sulper thermal power project had been primarily as a result of the
implementation of a well planned training program with concentration on pre-
operational spheres of activity such as planning, design and construction.
31.      The financial performance of NTPC during this period of
implementation and initial years of operation were satisfactory. In
particular, NTPC has been able to expand and diversify its sources of project
financing. Recently, NTPC has floated bonds in the domestic market in three
public issues, as well as two private placements, for a total of about
Rs 16.83 billion (US$990 million at the exchange rate at the time of the
financial operations). Further data on NTPC's finances are given in Part III.
The covenanted rate of return from April 1, 1988 on historically valued fixed
assets in operation was 9-1/2 percent. Against this, the rates of return for
NTPC from FY84 to FY89 are as given below:
FY84        FY85       FY86       FY87       FY88      FY89
Financial Rate       11.2         12.7       16.8       17.0       16.4      14.8
of Return
This high level of rates of return, however, did not translate into
adequate self-financing ratios (the average for the last six years was 6.7%),
partially because of NTPC's ambitious expansion program and partially because
the actual cash flow generated by operations was adversely affected by poor
collections, which during the last four years have increased to levels
equivalent to up to five months of sales, above the covenanted two months
ceiling. Th.'s highlights a shortcoming of the rate of return covenant which
does not differentiate between income accrued and income actually received.
Suggestions to modify the revenue covenant were not agreed to by GOI and NTPC.
To correct the collection problem an action plan has been drawn up in
consultation with the Association.
Project Relationship
32.      Good relationships were maintained by the Association with the
Borrower.
Consulting Services
33.      Since NTPC had acquired adequate experience in the area of design and
engineering of 200 MW units especially from the first stage of the Singrauli
power plant, there was no need to appoint consultants for the engineering of
the 200 MW units. For 500 MW units which were installed for the first time in
India, foreign consultants (a USA firm) were employed to provide NTPC
technical assistance in the design, the preparation of specification and
bidding documents and the evaluation of bids and the project management for
this part of the project. The performance of the consultants was
satisfactory.



_-9
Procurement
34.      Bank guidelines were strictly adhered to by NTPC for procurement of
39 contracts involving international competitive bidding. Rs 3,449.9 million
equivalent was disbursed from the IDA Credit as against USS 300 million.
Thirteen contracts were awarded to foreign firms for an amount estimated at
US$46.0 million. The average procurement time per contract -- from the
issuance of bid documents to contract award -- was nearly one year, consisting
of around 3.1 months for bidding and about 8.4 months for bid evaluation.
This latter time is certainly too long and constitutes a major source of
implementation delay. However, some progress in this regard has been made so
far in subsequent projects undertaken by NTPC (e.g. Farakka II). NTPC is in
the process of finalizing with the Bank a standard bidding document which is
expected to cut down the time lag substantially. Several contracts were
amended to include either supply of spare parts for equipment or additional
quantity of material. No significant claims were raised by bidders.
Project Documentation and Data
35.      The project's legal agreements adequately reflected the Association's
interests in a satisfactory execution of the project. The staff appraisal
report was comprehensive, well prepared and provided a useful framework for
the Association and NTPC during the project implementation. The Borrower
regularly submitted Quarterly Progress Reports for the project. This has been
used for review of physical and financial performance and it was generally
used for planning visits of the supervision missions to India, which often
included site visits in addition to review meetings at NTPC Corporate Office,
New Delhi.

B. Economic Impact
(1)      In the appraisal report, the return on investment was calculated for
the second phase expansion by 1,400 MW of the first 600 MW stage of the
Singrauli thermal power station to demonstrate the relationship between
tariffs and the economic cost of the development. It was defined as the
discount rate at which the present worth of the economic cost associated with
the development equals the present worth of the economic benefits over the
life cycle of the development. The measurable costs included:
(a) capital and labor costs involved in the development of generation and
transmission facilities;
(b) the annual operation and maintenance costs; and
(c) fuel costs.
The benefits were measured in terms of the revenues to be derived from the
sale of electricity.
(2)      Based on measurable economic costs and benefits associated with the
1,400 MW development, the ex-ante internal economic rate of return (IERR) was
estimated at about 13 percent. In the SAR for Singrauli first phase (Credit
No. 685), the ex-ante IERR associated with overall 2,000 MW development was
estimated at 10 percent. Actual tariffs have been higher than those envisaged
and this has more than compensated for a higher project cost and longer
construction period. The same approach results in an ex-post IERR of about 20
percent (Annex 1), basing on 2,000 MW development, which compares favorably
with opportunity cost of capital, implying that NTPC's bulk supply tariffs for
the Northern Region continue to adequately reflect the economic cost of
supply.

C. Financial Impact
(1)      As per the agreement, NTPC was to sell power from the project to SEBs
in the Eastern Region 1/ under bulk supply contracts satisfactory to the Bank
Group and GOI was to ensure that all necessa.y steps were taken to obtain an
undertaking from respective State Governments to purchase, in the aggregate,
not less than 85Z 2/ of the output of power from the Project. GOI and NTPC
have complied with their commitment despite an initial delay in the signing of
the bulk supply contracts. NTPC's operating and financial performance,
however, was not adversely affected by this delay.
(2)      NTPC's actual and project financial statements for the period
FY83-FY89 are presented in Annexes 2 to 4. The most salient feature of NTPC's
operations during the period FY84-FY88 is the spectacular growth the
corporation experienced. While net fixed assets in operation has increased
4.62 times, sales of electricity increased by more than 6 times. Even more
striking is the high level of investment in projects under construction.
Work-in-progress at the end of the period was almost 1.37 times that of assets
in operation. This reflects the continuation of a highly accelerated
expansion program which, in turn, explains why the self-financing ratio
remained modest during the period, representing only 6.7Z of the total
financing requirements, despite the reasonable rates of return achieved
(around 16Z in the last three years, well in excess of those projected in the
appraisal reports, and much higher than the 9.5Z required under the loan as a
target for FY89). Debt service coverage was very comfortable during tne
period because repayment of debt started only in FY89. Current ratio, which
was below one during the earlier part of the period improved to 1.8 by FY89.
However, a closer look at the working capital position of NTPC reveals,
starting in FY83, a very unsatisfactory collection performance. Under recent
loans, a covenant was introduced that requires that NTPC's receivables should
not exceed the equivalent of two months of sales. However, despite its best
efforts, NTPC has not been able to achieve this covenanted target. The GOI,
Bank and NTPC have agreed on a set of actions that are expected to correct the
situation. Satisfactory first steps of this action plan is a condition for
the presentation to the Board of the proposed Regional Power Systems Project,
which would cover NTPC's further investments. The following table represents
the key operational results forecast in the appraisal report compared with
actuals:
1/ Power from the Project was to be sold in bulk to the State Electricity
Boards of Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa and the Damodar Valley
Corporation.
2/ The remaining 15Z was to be sold in accordance with priorities to be
determined by CEA.

(3)       The Appraisal Reports' financial forecasts anticipated that NTPC
would eventually achieve and maintain from FY89 onwards (the first year in
which the 2,000 MW Singrauli power station was expected to be in full
commercial operation) a rate of return of not less than 9.52 on the original
cost of its average net fixed assets in service. As shown above, actual rates
of return were considerably higher than forecast. This was partly because of
the introduction of higher than forecast tariffs (see table below), and partly
due to better operation performance including higher than expected plant load
factor achieved at NTPC stations than the targets set in the appraisal report.
NTPC's average plant load factor ii.reased from 58X in FY85 to about 742 in
FY86, to 79.6X in FY87 and 75.6Z in FY88 at the Ramagundam, Korba, Farakka and
Singrauli power stations. The early stabilization of the Ramagundam 200 MW
units, increased availability of the Singrauli units (both 200 and 500 MW) and
a sustained high level of performance of Korba units (both 200 and 500 MW),
were the main reasons for this performance.

(4)      During the FY85-FY89 period, NTPC financed 572 of its rapid growth by
borrowing. GOI financed about 532 of NTPC's total requirements, two-thirds of
it through equity contributions and the balance as loans. This denotes a
heavy reliance on GOI support, which during NTPC's initial period of growth
was a sound policy. The Bank Group has financed approximately Rs 18.37
billion, or nearly one-fifth of NTPC's total financial requirements over the
past five years. GOI's loans have a total maturity of 20 years, including 5
years of grace and an interest rate which has changed over time and currently
is 152 p.a. It is worth noting that NTPC has floated bonds in the domestic
market in three public issues, as well as two private placements, for a total
of about Rs 16.83 billion (US$990 million at the current exchange rate), which
helped to finance about 212 of NTPC's total investment in the past five years.
The latest issue included two types of bonds: one carries a 13Z p.a. rate of
interest and a maturity of 7 years; the other pays 92 p.a., tax free, and is
redeemable in 10 years. In addition, NTPC has raised funds in Japan through a
syndicate of banks and financial institutions. Finally, NTPC has received
financing directly or through GOI, from the OPEC Fund, the Saudi Fund, the
Governments of the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom, the Sov.at
Union, Sweden, France, Norway, Italy and most recently, untied funds from
Japan. In FY88, NTPC completed two interest rate swaps from fixed to floating
interest rates. GOI's policy requires a return of not less than 102 on NTPC's
equity. However, this return on equity has thus far not been translated into
dividend payments and the totality of NTPC's profits has been retained in the
Corporation to help finance its large expansion program. This policy will be
maintained in the foreseeable future,
