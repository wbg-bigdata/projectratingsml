SECOND SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
I. THE POWER SECTOR
Background
1.01      Economic growth and improvement of the standard of living in India
depend critically on the development of the power sector. In the present
stage of economic development, the demand for power grows roughly twice as
fast as the economy. Because the power industry is relatively capital inten-
sive, its share in total fixed asset formation is increasing rapidly; the
power sector, which has made great strides in the last two decades, is today
the largest economic sector in the country in terms of investments. The sheer
size and increasing complexity of India's power sector, as well as economic
considerations, necessitate an approach to system planning which, to a much
larger extent than in the past, should concentrate on nationwide power devel-
opment and aim at making use of economies of scale through construction of
larger, more efficient power stations and interconnected high voltage trans-
mission systems.
1.02      The strategy of the Government of India (GOI) is to intensify
centralized planning of generation and'high voltage transmission with a view
to ultimately centralize control through a national grid with the operation
of generating plant on a merit order basis. To this end, GOI established
in 1975 two power generating companies, the National Thermal Power Corpora-
tion (NTPC) and the National Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC) to construct and
operate large thermal and hydro power stations and associated transmission.
Consultants have been engaged to assist the Central Electricity Authority
(CEA) in undertaking a 400 kV system study to determine the configuration and
parameters of the future interconnected national power system. GOI also
decided to proceed with the construction of four large thermal power stations
of 1,100 MW to 2,100 MW capacity to be built in two stages, located on coal
fields and supplying bulk power to the States via an interconnected 400 kV
transmission system. The construction of three such developments, the 2,000
MW Singrauli, the 2,100 MW Korba and the 2,100 MW Ramagundam projects, has
been started with IDA/Bank financial assistance. This comprises 600 MW of
generating plant and transmission for each project (Credits 685-IN Singrauli,
793-IN Korba, 874-IN and Loan 1648-IN Ramagundam). The second stage of
Singrauli, comprising two additional 200 MW units and two 500 MW units with
associated transmission facilities, is the subject of this report. An IDA
credit of US$300 million is proposed.
Energy Resources
1.03      India's main commercial energy resources are coal, oil, natural
gas and hydro power. There are also resources of nuclear fuels, principally
uranium and thorium, and India's power program includes the construction of
further "CANDU" type heavy water reactors using domestically produced natural



- 2 -
uranium as fuel. Two nuclear power stations have been constructed to date
and a third is under construction. Some geothermal energy sites have also
been identified, but the potential appears to be limited.
1.04      Coal is by far the most extensive indigenous fossil fuel; reserves
are estimated at 83 billion tons of which some 21 billion tons have been
proven. Additionally, total reserves of lignite at the Neyveli field in
Tamil Nadu are estimated at around 2 billion tons. If low quality coal, e.g.,
coal with high ash and moisture content, is excluded, the estimate of commer-
cially usable coal and lignite is reduced to approximately 24 billion tons
which, on a forecast countrywide usage, would be adequate for some 50 years
under current assumptions of economic growth.
1.05      By comparison with coal, proven reserves of oil are small.  However,
oil and gas exploration programs are still going on. Exploration and drill-
ing activities to date have already proven an estimated 230 million tons on
shore, and recent off-shore discoveries west of Bombay in the Arabian Sea have
led to delineation of fields with proven recoverable reserves of about 250
million tons of crude oil and 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Other
reserves of natural gas, which are found in India both alone and in associa-
tion with crude oil, are estimated at over 100 billion cubic meters.
1.06      The potential of hydroelectric power resources is estimated at
70,000 MW of which some 11,000 MW has already been developed. A further
4,700 MW is scheduled for commissioning by FY1984 (see Table 1.2) and some
23,000 MW is currently under investigation or scheduled for investigation.
Some 70% of the total potential is in the Northern and Northeastern regions.
Additional emphasis on hydro power investments is planned.
1.07      Oil and natural gas have important alternative uses and it is un-
likely that they will be a significant factor in the generation of electric
power. The Government intends, therefore, to base the development of generat-
ing facilities for the foreseeable future on coal or lignite burning thermal
stations and hydroelectric power stations and to gradually develop a small
nuclear program.
Past Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.08      The Bank has made nine loans to India for power projects amounting
to US$334.5 million and IDA twelve credits totalling US$1,171 million. Of
this amount US$870.5 million involves financing of generating plant; US$23
million the purchase of construction equipment for the Beas hydroelectric
project; US$380 million the provision of high voltage transmission; and US$232
million the purchase of rural electrification equipment. Nine loans and
credits for generating plant, the Beas project (Credit 89-IN) and the first
three transmission projects (Loan 416-IN Credits 242-IN and 377-IN) have been
completed. The Fourth Transmission Project (Credit 604-IN) is nearing comple-
tion, and the whole credit amount of US$150 million has been committed. The
Third Trombay Thermal Power Project (Loan 1549-IN) was approved in April 1978.
The Ramagundam Thermal Power Project (Credit 874-IN and Loan 1648-IN) and the



-3-
Second Rural Electrification Project (Credit 911-IN), are still in the preli-
minary implementation stage and no disbursements have yet been made. Commit-
ments to April 30, 1980 totalled some US$500 million on the four thermal power
plant projects (Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Trombay) and US$150 million
on the two Rural Electrification Projects (Credits 572-IN and 911-IN).
1.09      The Singrauli, Korba and Trombay projects are on schedule.  The
Ramagundam Project, the Fourth Power Transmission Project and the First Rural
Electrification Project are proceeding satisfactorily notwithstanding initial
delays in implementation and the substantial delay in preparation of specifi-
cations and review of tenders for the more sophisticated load dispatch equip-
ment in the case of the transmission project.
Sector Institutions
1.10      The principal agencies in the industry are:  (i) the State Elec-
tricity Boards (SEBs); (ii) the Atomic Energy Commission; (iii) the Central
Electricity Authority (CEA); (iv) Regional Electricity Boards; (v) the two
Central Power Corporations (NTPC and NHPC); and (vi) the Rural Electrification
Corporation Ltd (REC).
1.11      The SEBs are constituted by the State Governments under the provi-
sions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, to promote the coordinated
development of the generation, supply and distribution of electricity within
their respective States in the most efficient and economical manner, and for
the control and regulation of other supply undertakings which are private
licensees. These comprise municipal utilities such as Bombay Suburban Elec-
tric Supply Undertaking, and private utilities, the largest of which are the
Tata Electric Companies, (Bombay), the Calcutta Electric Supply Company, and
the Ahmedabad Electric Supply Company. At the present time, the States effec-
tively own or control well over 90% of electricity supply facilities. While
the SEBs are corporate entities in their own right and enjoy some autonomy
in the management of their day-to-day operations, they are under the control
of their State Governments in such matters as policy, capital investment,
tariff changes, borrowings, pay scales and personnel policies.
1.12      The CEA was formally created in 1950 with responsibility for devel-
oping a national policy for power development and coordinating the activities
of the various planning agencies involved in electricity supply. At that
time, it came under the Power Wing of the Central Water and Power Commission
(CWPC). As a result of administrative changes introduced in October 1974,
responsibility for power was transferred to the Ministry of Energy, which was
created at that time to bring together ministerial responsibility for coal and
power. This involved the transfer of the Power Wing of the former CWPC to the
CEA, which now comes under the Department of Power of the Ministry of Energy
and is responsible for developing a sound national policy for the electricity
supply industry. The Department of Atomic Energy, which is directly responsi-
ble to the Prime Minister, deals with nuclear power generation.
1.13      CEA's powers were enlarged through amendments to the general
provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, which were enacted on



-4-
November 30, 1976. In addition to its general responsibilities for national
power policies, it is now responsible for the formulation and coordination
of plans for power development, optimization of investments in the power
sector for the whole country, development of interconnected system operation,
training of personnel and research and development. It includes specialist
engineering organizations which provide comprehensive project engineering
services to the electricity supply industry. The Thermal Department also
takes responsibility for monitoring the performance and maintenance records
of thermal power stations and for organizing the training of power station
personnel. The Economic and Commercial Department accumulates data on
economic, finance and accounting aspects of the power industry in India,
both at Center and State levels, with particular reference to the operations
of the SEBs. The emerging role of CEA in financial affairs is evidenced by
the conveying of statutory authority 1/ on it to formulate, in conjunction
with GOI, policy for the accounting treatment of depreciation of fixed assets
in the power sector in India. CEA is also playing a leading role in advising
State Governments on the measures to be taken to implement the amendments
to the financial provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, and is
also providing information to the various working panels of the Rajadhyaksha
Committee (para 1.42). A recent major achievement for the CEA was the adop-
tion by the SEBs of a uniform system of commercial accounting, devised by it
over a period of time. This system, which applies to all SEB accounts from
April 1979, brings uniformity to the procedures relating to the maintenance
of accounts, and, for the first time, enables direct inter-Board comparison
of financial results.
1.14      The SEBs and the other licensed electricity undertakings are
required to submit their investment proposals to the CEA for technical and
economic appraisal and to the Energy Division of the Planning Commission for
inclusion in the Five Year Plan. The Planning Commission is responsible for
the allocation of Plan funds among the States and among sectors. Planning
of generation, transmission, and distribution development has traditionally
been undertaken by each SEB for its own State rather than on a regional or
national basis. However, with the rapid growth of the power sector and with
the resultant increasing complexity of operation, GOI sees the necessity for
an integrated national approach to sector development.
1.15      Four Regional Electricity Boards (REBs), for the Northern, Southern,
Eastern and Western regions, were established between 1964 and 1966 by common
resolution of the State and Central Governments, to help develop integrated
power systems in their respective regions, and thus prepare for the transition
from separate power systems at State level to regional systems and finally to
an interconnected national grid. The chairmanship of each REB is assumed in
rotation by the Chairmen,of the SEBs within the region and they are staffed by
engineers seconded from their constituent SEBs. The general functions of the
REBs are to plan integrated operation of the power systems in the region for
the maximum benefit of the region as a whole, coordinate overhaul and mainten-
ance programs, determine generation schedules to be followed and the power

-5-
available for transfer between States and determine a suitable tariff structure
for the transfer of power within the region. At present, the Boards function
mainly in an advisory role in relation to the SEBs.
1.16      NTPC and NHPC are at present not intended to take a leading role
in the generation and sale of power in the States. At the present time, the
construction of four large central thermal power stations has been started as
mentioned in paragraph 1.02. All of these developments are being constructed
and will be operated by NTPC. NHPC will construct and operate large hydro-
electric projects. A transmission wing has also been established in NHPC to
design and construct the 220 kV and 400 kV overhead transmission associated
with hydro-projects, and any other transmission work which it might be commis-
sioned to undertake. In most States, the SEB will continue for some time to
be the largest power undertaking.
1.17      REC was incorporated in July 1969 under the Indian Companies Act,
1965, as a company wholly owned by GOI, under the general supervision of the
then Ministry of Irrigation and Power (now under the Ministry of Energy).
REC's chief objective is to finance rural electrification schemes throughout
the country, acting as a financial intermediary with technical expertise,
and administering funds received primarily from GOI. It is REC's function
to ensure efficient allocation of these funds by establishing policies,
procedures, and criteria for the formulation, approval and implementation
of such schemes. In doing so, REC is directed to adopt a "project approach,"
coordinating electrification with other inputs in rural development in order
to achieve increased agricultural production and overall economic development.
Existing Facilities - All India
1.18      The total installed generating capacity in the whole of India as
of March 31, 1979 was just under 29,000 MW, including about 2,225 MW of non-
utility capacity, mostly thermal, which is owned by major industrial consumers
to meet their own needs. The generating capacity is shown in Table 1.1 below:

1.19      Transmission is at 132 kV and 220 kV and, generally, load centers
are interconnected by 132 kV and 33 kV subtransmission lines. Distribution
voltages are 11 kV and 415/240 V. The supply, in general, is reliable, but
power shortages, especially during the summer months, necessitate shutdowns
and brownouts. System losses have been reduced in recent years but they are
still high accounting for about 20% of units sent out. This subject is under
examination by the "Rajadhyaksha Committee" (see para 1.42).
Power Supply/Demand Balance - All India
1.20      India's installed power generating capacity increased at an annual
rate of 10.3% during the 1950s and 1960s while gross electricity generation
grew at just under 12% during this 20 year-period due to a better utilization
of the generating capacity. Although local and intermittent shortages did
occur during this period, system failures did not present a major problem.
However, by the early 1970s, the supply situation had grown more serious and
potential unconstrained demand consistently outpaced supply in a number of
states. This situation was due to several factors such as: failure to imple-
ment projects in accordance with planned schedules; inadequate transmission
development; operating and maintenance problems leading to a low plant avail-
ability factor of around 72%; inadequate budget allocation and the absence of
monsoon rains, particularly during the early 1970s, leading to lower hydro
output.
1.21      The shortage situation was most serious in 1974/75 and 1977/78 and
is again extremely serious now, particularly in the Eastern Region. The
estimated deficit of energy throughout India in 1974/75 was about 11,000 GWh
(14.1%); this fell to 8,600 GWh (10.3%) in 1975/76 and to 5,100 GWh (5.8%) in
1976/77, but increased to 15,800 GWh (15.5%) in 1977/78. Data for 1978/79
indicate that the deficit was of the order of 10%.
1.22      Power shortages, particularly in the industrial sector, have affected
the output of the country and the cost in terms of industrial production fore-
gone has been substantial (generally, energy restrictions fall on industry and
there is relatively little loss to the economy on account of power shortages in
either the residential or agricultural sectors). Lost value-added due to lost
industrial production because of power restrictions, could well be in the
neighborhood of 3% of GDP. 1/
1.23      The growth of the power sector during the last 10 years and the
pattern of consumption during this period is shown in Annex 1. Sales to agri-
culture and irrigation have increased substantially during the 1970s, mainly
because of the rural development programs. Industrial demand as a proportion
of the total demand has declined, and there has been a small but steady increase
in domestic demand. It is expected that this pattern of demand will continue
with a gradual improvement in the annual load factor.

No. 2335-IN, paragraph 68).

Future Development - All India
1.24      The countrywide peak demand in 1977/78 was 15,520 MW; according
to CEA's estimates, unconstrained demand was expected to increase to about
20,300 MW by 1979/80, 18,600 MW of which are being met by available capacity.
Installed capacity by 1979/80 was expected to reach about 31,900 MW of which
29,700 MW would be utility plant with the balance of 2,200 MW non-utility.
1.25      The development program provides for an expansion of generating
capacity during the five-year period 1979/80-1983/84, including the nuclear
power plants which are scheduled to come into operation during that period,
by about 19,000 MW, so that the total planned installed capacity would be
about 45,000 MW by 1983/84. The additional capacity scheduled for commis-
sioning during this period is shown in more detail in Table 1.2. Furthermore,
the construction of some 15,000 km of 400 kV transmission lines is planned
to enable full integration of the regional systems and the evacuation of the
output from the proposed large thermal power stations.

1.26      Table 1.3 shows the planned annual installed capacity aggregating
about 45,600 MW in 1983/84, the available capacity, the peak load and the
forecast of energy requirements and availability (not taking into account
diversity). The data referring to the peak load and energy requirement in
1978/79 show the demand constrained by supply. The estimated unsuppressed
power and energy demand would have been about 10% higher (see para 1.21).
The forecasts of peak load and energy requirements are based upon continuous
monitoring of development trends during the preparation of the annual electric
power surveys of India. If the program of generation development can be
achieved on time, the present shortage of energy would be eliminated from
1982/83 on, but there would still be a capacity deficit through the five-year
period due to a low availability factor of generating plants. The peak avail-
ability in India under present operating conditions, is around 60% of installed
capacity. This availability factor is expected to improve gradually as a
result of the development of system interconnection and the improvement of
maintenance practices.

1.27      Table 1.3 also indicates that both peak load and energy requirement
are estimated to grow at an average annual rate of around 10% during the five
year period 1978/79-1983/84. The forecast capacity deficit decreases from
around 10% of the system load in 1979/80 to 4% in 1983/84 and the energy
availability exceeds energy demand by some 3% in 1983/84. These are varia-
tions which are less than the accuracy of any of the forecast data inputs, but
they demonstrate that, if anything, a case could be made for sanctioning more
capacity than presently planned for commissioning during the five-year period
ending 1983/84, particularly since All-India data mask shortages in specific
regions, which may develop due to insufficient interconnection.
Regional Demand and Supply - Northern Region
1.28      The major authorities supplying the Northern region are the Uttar
Pradesh State Electricity Board (UPSEB), the Punjab State Electricity Board
(PSEB), the Haryana State Electricity Board (HSEB), the Delhi Electricity
Supply Undertaking (DESU), the Rajasthan State Electricity Board (RSEB), the
Jammu and Kashmir State Electricity Board (JKSEB), and the Himachal Pradesh
State Electricity Board (HPSEB). NTPC operates the Government-owned 510 MW
thermal station at Badarpur. Each of these authorities owns either totally
or partly generating facilities and (with the exception of NTPC) supplies
electricity to final consumers. Interchanges of temporary power surplus are
common.
1.29      The Bhakra/Beas hydroelectric generating complex is jointly owned by
the SEBs of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. These SEBs draw energy from thi6
facility in accordance with their ownership shares. In addition, energy is
supplied on a contractual basis to "common pool consumers" such as part of
Himachal Pradesh, the Nangal Fertilizer Factory, Chandigarh, and Jammu and
Kashmir. The largest intra-regional transfers are recorded between the



- 9 -
Bhakra/Beas complex and its owners and bulk consumers, the second largest
transfer occurs from the Badarpur thermal power station to DESU. Annex 2
describes the regional demand and supply situation in quantitative detail.
49% of installed regional capacity is thermal, 48% hydro, and the remainder
nuclear. This hides significant differences between States: only UPSEB,
DESU and the Central Sector are not heavily dependent on hydro generating
facilities. Installed capacity has been growing at a rate of about 13% p.a.
in recent years--firm available capacity, however, only at 9% p.a., reflect-
ing a falling availability percentage. Availability is expected to improve
by 1983/84, by which time an additional 4,655 MW are expected to have been
added to the existing capacity, most of it thermal and nuclear.
1.30      The region is less industrially oriented than the Indian average--
only 52% of consumption is attributable to industry, compared to a national
average of 66%. Agriculture, with its greatest burden on the supply system,
is significantly more important than on an All-India basis. Energy consump-
tion has been growing at an average annual rate of 14.5%, with fluctuations
depending on hydro availability. Some reduction in technical losses has been
achieved (Annex 3).
1.31      Peak unconstrained capacity demand is expected to exceed available
capacity for the foreseeable future: the anticipated shortfall will be
growing steadily to reach more than 1,100 MW in 1983/84. It is likely that
persistent shortages will continue well beyond 1984 (Annexes 4 and 5). In
1983/84, the capacity of the proposed project's first stage will be the equiv-
alent of 7% of regional capacity. At the time of commissioning of the last
unit, the proposed project will represent about 3% of potential unconstrained
regional capacity demand (Annex 6). The shift of responsibility for power
generation from SEBs to NTPC is reflected in the lower anticipated percentage
of the SEBs' investment programs devoted to generating facilities (Annex 7).
All supply authorities in the region had to impose restrictions on demand
in 1978/79. Restrictions are widespread in Uttar Pradesh, imposing large
cuts on capacity demand and energy consumption (Annex 2), mostly borne by
industry. Rotation of supply to rural areas is common, as is ad hoc load
shedding.
Future Integrated System Operation
1.32      With the increasing size of the power sector in India and its far-
reaching impact on the country's economy, annual surveys and Five-Year Plans
at the State level have become insufficient as a basis for power development
planning. The larger size of power plants, their consequent longer construc-
tion period--on average six to eight years for thermal plants and eight to
ten years for hydro plants--as well as their gradual interconnection require
a long-range perspective for investment decisions on a regional and national
level.
1.33      Recognizing the need for coordinated power development throughout
the country, provision was made in Credit 604-IN to help finance the cost
of consultants to study the technical, financial and economic aspects of a
long-term national plan for the sector. Such a plan should include, inter
alia, detailed demand forecasts, investigation of power generation schemes



- 10 -
to meet load growth requirements for a 15-20 year period (indicating costs and
sequencing of investments to optimize resources), development of primary grid
configurations, including the 400 kV system study which CEA has started but
which has come to a temporary standstill mainly due to lack of overall plan-
ning, coordination of power plans with plans for other sectors (determining
resource requirements), and recommendations on responsibilities and needed
operational policies at the State, regional and national levels (Annex 8).
Such a study is an essential prerequisite for formulating sound policies for
future development of the sector, and the Government has indicated its inten-
tion to complete such a study by April 1982.
1.34      The operation of regional systems, which will be integrated in the
future in a national grid, requires large numbers of personnel who would have
to be trained in the use of sophisticated load dispatch equipment and inter-
connected systems operation. A UNDP project designed to assist CEA in devel-
oping programs for training staff to operate the future load dispatch centers
came to a halt in 1977, primarily because of personnel problems, and lack of
counterpart staff. GOI's plans to revise this project, in consultation with
UNDP, were discussed during negotiations. These plans would form part of a
wider program for strengthening systems operation and training. The Associa-
tion would be kept informed about the development of such program.
Bank Group's Strategy in the Sector
1.35      The Bank Group's strategy in its involvement in the Indian power
sector, has been one of co-operation with GOI in seeking solutions to the
many difficult and politically sensitive problems which have confronted the
Indian electricity supply industry since Independence. The sensitivity of
Center-State relations, because of concurrent jurisdiction over the electri-
city supply industry, has dictated that a policy of persuasion rather than
one of explicit leverage would produce better results.
1.36      The Bank Group's main objectives in the sector are:
(a) assistance in accelerating the installation of gene-
rating capacity and promoting measures to improve
the operation and maintenance of existing plant 1/
in order to gradually eliminate the prevailing power
shortages in the country;
(b) assistance in introducing long-range system plan-
ning on a nationwide basis which would assure imple-
mentation of a least-cost power development program;
(c) promotion of appropriate measures with respect to
improving the sector organization and training; and
1/   This subject is dealt with in the terms of reference of both the
suggested Least-cost Power Development Study (Annex 8, para. 3) and
the Rajadhyaksha Committee (see para 1.42 and Annex 10).



- 11 -
(d)  strengthening of the finances of the institutions involved
in the sector, particularly of the State Electricity Boards
(SEBs), through setting of rate-of-return targets or levels
of self-financing and advising in designing of appropriate
tariff systems.
1.37      Progress towards achieving the above goals has been hindered by
constitutional factors. Under the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948, power supply
is a concurrent subject. This means that the responsibility for supplying
electricity is shared between the Central Government and the State Governments,
requiring full agreement between the Center and the States for the implement-
ation of most actions. The States operate, and develop, through their Elec-
tricity Boards, most of the power facilities. The consequence of this arrange-
ment in many instances has been a parochial approach where a national or at
least regional approach would have been more beneficial. On the other hand,
it is debatable whether Central initiative could have been taken much further
in the time available. The radical proposal which would have enabled power
system generation and bulk supply to be exclusively a Central responsibility,
would have meant a considerable upheaval and would have have raised fundamental
political and constitutional issues going well beyond efficiency considerations.
1.38      Given these difficulties, results achieved so far have been encourag-
ing. They are the following:
(a)  with the establishment of the Regional Electricity Boards
(REBs, para 1.15) and later of NTPC and NHPC, the first
important steps towards an improved organizational struc-
ture of the power sector have been made. GOI intends to
gradually strengthen the authority of the REBs and to
increase their role of coordinating the SEBs in matters
of power development and operations;
(b)  CEA was reorganized and had its powers enlarged through
the amendment in 1976 of the Electricity (Supply) Act
1948 (paras 1.12 and 1.13);
(c)  a recent amendment of the financial provisions of the
Electricity (Supply) Act 1948 requires that tariffs be
set at levels sufficient to enable the SEBs to finance
from internal sources a reasonable proportion of their
investment programs;
(d)  recently, SEBs in the Northern Region and the Delhi
Electricity Supply Undertaking (DESU), have developed
and partially implemented plans designed to restore the
covenanted rate of return of 9-1/2% (Credit 604-IN).
These plans consist of tariff increases, rationalization
of manpower requirements and other cost effective measures;
(e)  with a view to the reassessment of tariff policies,
the majority of the SEBs have recently completed



- 12 -
tariff studies based on marginal cost pricing principles.
The Bank Group's review of these studies recommended the
standardization of certain assumptions so as to produce
a uniform methodology for general application by all SEBs.
To assist in this standardization process, CEA is establish-
ing a specialist department to interact with the SEBs and
to keep the Bank Group advised of future developments; and
(f) NTPC's generation/transmission construction program (paras
3.01 and 3.02), which is in the process of staged implemen-
tation with Bank Group assistance, will make an important
contribution to the gradual elimination of the present
deficit in the country's power balance. The proposed
project would help to continue this program.
1.39      There are two major remaining areas which have been the cause of con-
cern to the Bank Group and also have been the subject of continuing dialogue
with GOI.  They are:
(a) the weakness of nationwide long-range planning for power
development; and
(b) the weak financial position of a number of SEBs which,
for instance, have not always been able to achieve the
covenanted rate of return of 9-1/2%.
1.40      In the continued effort of the Bank Group in dealing with the long-
range problems of the power sector in India, it was decided to concentrate
on the above two areas. During appraisal and negotiations, discussions were
held with CEA, NTPC and NHPC on the content of a long-range power development
study designed to prepare a least-cost power development program, CEA's capa-
bility to undertake such study with its own staff, and the possible need for
consultants' support (para 1.33). Agreements were reached during negotiations
on the preparation of a least-cost development program based on the terms of
reference suggested by the Association.
1.41      From a commercial point of view, the financial performance of
several SEBs, the sole customers of NTPC, has been marginal (for detailed
explanation see Annex 9) and even in years when 9-1/2% rates of return were
achieved, a number of SEBs were not able to meet their debt service require-
ments. 1/ There are several reasons for this unsatisfactory performance,
1/   However, in all States except one, excise taxes or duties are levied
on electricity sales. Including such taxes as a benefit to the States/
SEBs increases the returns by up to 5 percentage points. Furthermore,
a recently enacted GOI tax on kWh generated is also equivalent to a
return of about 2-3 percentage points. The total return in economic
terms is therefore substantially higher than the commercial return to
the SEBs.



- 13 -
such as insufficient generating capacity which does not permit utilization of
the market potential to the fullest extent, less than efficient operating of
existing plant, lack of monsoon rains in the Eastern Region leading to severe
load shedding and blackouts, railroad and coal mine strikes resulting in insuf-
ficient coal supply, and low tariff levels. In the Northern Region (supply
area of the Singrauli station), the SEBs and the DESU have taken steps to
redress the shortcomings (para 1.38d). The GOI representatives indicated
during negotiations that these organizations were currently operating at
levels which are expected to achieve rates of return of at least 9.5%, net
of taxes.
1.42      Indian authorities have recognized that with the rapidly expanding
power sector in the coontry, all aspects of the sector have to be reviewed
and that satisfactory solutions have to be found for the various sector prob-
lems. Consequently, GOI has established a high-level committee in November
1978, known as the "Rajadhyaksha Committee", so called after the name of its
Chairman. This committee, whose terms of reference are attached as Annex 10,
has been assigned the task to examine and make recommendations for improve-
ments of the following aspects of the power sector:
(a) power planning;
(b) project formulation and implementation;
(c) operation and maintenance;
(d)  organization and management;
(e) finance, financial management and tariffs;
(f) rural electrification; and
(g) research and development.
Draft reports by the seven expert panels assembled for this purpose have been
completed and are under review by the committee. The committee is expected to
submit its findings to GOI during 1980. The Bank Group will continue to take
an active interest in the committee's progress, and it is recognized that the
Bank Group may have to modify its approach to the problems of the Indian power
sector in case the committee recommends approaches different from the present
Bank Group approach, but equally acceptable. For example, one of the major
concerns would be that consumers contribute more towards the cost of power
supply facilities through allowing their SEBs to generate internally a reason-
able proportion of their capital investments.
II. THE BENEFICIARY - NATIONAL THERMAL POWER CORPORATION LIMITED
Legal Status and Authorities
2.01      NTPC, the beneficiary of the proposed credit was established in
1975 under the Companies Act, 1956. The Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, has



- 14 -
been amended to give the Corporation statutory recognition. NTPC is a company
wholly owned by GOI under the general supervision of the Ministry of Energy.
Its initial authorized share capital of Rs 1,250 million (US$149 million) was
increased in May 1979 to Rs 3,000 (US$357 million). The Corporation has a
Board of Directors consisting of not less than four and not more than fifteen,
some of whom are part-time.
2.02      The Companies Act, 1956, confers broad powers on NTPC to carry out
its work. However, the tariffs to be applied, as well as, any changes in such
tariffs, its investment plans and annual capital budgets, have to be approved
by the Government. NTPC is also subject to periodic examination by the
Committee on Public Undertakings--a body established by GOI to monitor the
performance of public sector enterprises.
2.03      The main objectives for which the Corporation has been established
are:
(i)  to design, construct, and operate large central thermal
power stations and projects; and
(ii)  to transmit and sell the power generated.
NTPC will initially own and operate the associated 400 kV transmission system
over which power will be distributed and sold in bulk to State Electricity
Boards. Later this system will be part of the 400 kV interconnected regional
system which will be integrated into the national grid.
2.04      NTPC's present program provides for the construction of four thermal
power stations, (Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka). It is also possi-
ble that NTPC might ultimately take over the 510 MW Badarpur station near
Delhi (ultimate planned capacity 720 MW). Presently NTPC is in charge of the
operation of Badarpur on a management fee basis.
Organization and Management
2.05      NTPC's organization which at present is necessarily construction
oriented is shown in Annex 11, page 1. The complete range of management
systems for all disciplines now under formulation are shown in Annex 11,
pages 2 and 3. These are based on the philosophies explained in the NTPC
publication "Framework for Project Management" which was discussed with NTPC
during negotiations for the Ramagundam project and further reviewed by the
mission during appraisal. The organization is adequate.
2.06      NTPC has adopted a two-tier organizational structure:  one at the
central/corporate level and the other for the projects. In addition to the
accepted corporate level, activities such as the development and formulation
of policies, and other services relevant to the projects, have been centralized;
these are Technical Services, Contract and Procurement Services, Quality
Assurance and Expediting and Project Management Services. Other departments
at the central level are Corporate Planning and Marketing, Corporate Finance,
Personnel and Administration.



- 15 -
2.07      The second tier, which embraces project activities, consists of a
project organization for each of the four power plants under construction.
Each project organization is headed by a General Manager who is entrusted
with total responsibility for implementation of all aspects of the project's
construction program.
2.08      Good progress has been made in building up the organization since
1975 when NTPC was established. The Chairman and Managing Director was
appointed in early 1976 and the number of staff appointed by February 29,
1980, was 2,658 comprising 523 executives, 131 executives in training and
2,006 non-executives. NTPC has also taken over the majority of the employees
of the Badarpur Project and Power Station (see para 2.04).
2.09      Present indications are that NTPC is developing along sound lines.
It has a Chairman and Managing Director who is a competent administrator with
an established reputation in the formation and development of large industrial
undertakings. He has taken a great personal interest in developing a compre-
hensive project management system as well as designing the organization and
procedures, while building up an establishment of highly motivated engineers
and staff. Remarkable progress has been made in all activities in the four
years since his appointement and providing this impetus can be maintained with
no deterioration in management, NTPC should, with the assistance of consultants,
be capable of handling the present large development program. Site organiza-
tions are effectively functioning at the Singrauli, Korba and Ramagundam proj-
ects. The centralized functions which, in addition to the corporate person-
nel, are planning and finance, and provide the engineering, contracting and
project management input. They are organized to meet the project requirements
and to ensure an effective coordination of the projects under construction.
Training
2.10      NTPC is a young organization which is growing rapidly to meet the
demands of its large construction program. The next phase of expansion will
involve the need to recruit and train operating staff. When all current
developments have been completed and commissioned, NTPC's establishment will
have grown from a present 2,658 to a figure in the neighborhood of 10,000.
The importance, therefore, of implementing training programs for the various
expertises required during the construction and operational phases cannot
be too highly stressed.
2.11      Fortunately, NTPC has placed special importance on this aspect of
its organization, and training programs are being developed by the Corpora-
tion which will, in due course, be backed by a training school equipped with
a simulator, financed from funds of Credit 793-IN, and other modern facilities
for instructing and training the operating staff.
2.12      NTPC's training programs are presently concentrated on pre-
operational spheres of activity such as Planning, Design, Construction and
Management. Some of the current major activities are:



- 16 -
(a) Professional engineering training for Executive Trainees
(Engineering).
(b) Professional engineering training for Supervisory Trainees
(Engineering).
(c) Management development programs.
(d) Seminars and lectures on selected topics.
(e) Familiarization courses for both accounting and managerial
staff on the accounting systems and procedures being imple-
mented by NTPC's consultants.
Recruitment of young executive trainees is mainly from engineering graduates
belonging to mechanical, electrical and civil disciplines on appointment,
who are inducted into a one-year training program. The first group of young
executive trainees was recruited in February 1977, the second in December
1977 and the third by mid-1978 comprising 35, 45 and 84 members respectively.
The third group comprising 100 trainees was recruited during 1978 and joined
the professional engineering training course which started on November 15,
1978. The fourth group comprising 131 trainees was recruited in 1979 and the
training was started on November 25, 1979. The training programs have been
well designed to provide exposure to power stations under construction and
operation, equipment manufacturing plants, engineering descriptions and project
management services. For these purposes, assistance is taken from a large
faculty of experienced engineers and managers selected from all over the
country.
2.13      With the first 200 MW generating unit scheduled to commence commer-
cial operation in FY1982, NTPC has finalized comprehensive plans for training
operational staff, particularly the non-supervisory staff, in the various
technical and non-technical trades, to provide foremen to the first two units
at Singrauli. The manpower for these is being drawn from experienced staff
as well as from fresh recruitment. Recruitment of manpower has commenced and
key personnel such as the station superintendent, are already in position.
2.14      On-the-job training has high priority.  The methodology includes
classroom lectures, participation in group exercises and discussions sup-
ported by direct reading, audio-visual presentations and plant visits.
Overall training plans and arrangements at this time are satisfactory.
Sale of Power from the Project
2.15      GOI proposes to allocate 85Z of Singrauli's power to the SEBs of
Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and the DESU, the remaining 15%
being sold in accordance with priorities to be determined by CEA to States
with the greatest need.  The Association has received undertakings from the
respective SEBs and DESU confirming that they would take power in accordance
with agreed allocations, in aggregate not less than 85% of the output of
power from the project.

Accounting Organization and Systems
2.16      NTPC and its management consultants report good progress in the
planning of NTPC's finance and accounting organization (Annex 12) and in the
design and implementation of accounting systems and procedures. The design
of systems for both the construction and operational phases of NTPC's activ-
ities has been completed. Implementation of systems for the construction
phase is either complete or at an advanced stage both at the corporate center
at headquarters, and also at the sites, while the consultants' proposals for
the operational phase are at an advanced stage of discussion with management.
To familiarize staff with the systems and procedures, training courses are
being conducted by the consultants in conjunction with staff members from
NTPC's corporate cente'r.
2.17      Current problems being faced by NTPC and its consultants in build-
ing up the accounting organization are: difficulties in obtaining adequately
qualified staff; retaining staff at project sites, and the introduction of
tighter controls in the management of materials on sites. This latter prob-
lem will be resolved by the introduction of the systems for inventory control
which have been planned by management. These would include continuous stock
checking and the use of more sophisticated weighing and measuring facilities.
The personnel problems are likely to be more difficult to resolve.
Audit
2.18      The audit of NTPC's accounts and records is undertaken by a profes-
sional auditor appointed by the Company Law Audit Board, on the recommendation
of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. The auditor is normally a
member of the Indian Institute of Chartered Accountants, and his audit report
on NTPC's financial statements is subject to comment by the Auditor General.
The current auditor Messrs. V. K. Mehta and Company, Chartered Accountants,
Delhi, has audited NTPC's accounts since its incorporation on November 7,
1975, and their audit reports have expressed satisfaction at the state of the
company's affairs during this period.  It should be borne in mind that NTPC's
activities will cover only project construction until FY1982 when power will
be sold for the first time.  NTPC has already undertaken, in connection with
previous credits and loan, to submit to the Association/Bank audited financial
statements within seven months of the end of the fiscal year to which they
relate, together with a certified report by the auditor, and a review of the
accounts by the Director of Commercial Audits. This has been restated in
connection with the proposed credit.
III. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
3.01      NTPC's present development program comprising the four central
thermal power stations Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka, with asso-
ciated 400 kV transmission, is part of India's power development program
which is described in paragraphs 1.24 through 1.27. The four power plants,



- 18 -
totalling 7,300 MW, have been located on coal fields, since it is more econo-
mical to transport electricity than coal to the load centers.
3.02      The first stages of the four central power stations consisting in
each case of 3 x 200 MW generating units and associated transmission are under
construction. The commissioning of the power plant units is scheduled between
February 1982 (first 200 MW unit at Singrauli) and July 1989 (last 500 MW
unit at Ramagundam).
The Project
3.03      The project represents the second stage of the Singrauli develop-
ment comprising two additional 200 MW units and two 500 MW units with asso-
ciated transmission totalling about 2,000 km of 400 kV lines. This extension
would bring the power plant to its final installed capacity of 2,000 MW.
3.04      The Singrauli development which is described in detail in Annex 13
is being constructed on the fringe of the Rihand Reservoir close to the Sin-
grauli coal field deposit at Kota in the Mirzapur district of Uttar Pradesh
(see attached maps).
Estimated Cost
3.05      The estimated cost of the project, excluding interest during con-
struction and duties and taxes, is about Rs 7,175 million (US$854 million).
On the assumption that most of the contracts will be won by Indian suppliers,
the direct and indirect foreign currency costs are estimated at about Rs 1,199
million (US$238 million) and the local currency costs at Rs 5,176 million
(US$616 million). The estimated costs of the principal features of the proj-
ect are shown in Table 3.1 below, and in more detail in Annex 14.

- 19 -
3.06      The estimates for the main items of equipment are based on the
quotations received during 1977, 1978 and 1979 for similar types of plant and
equipment for the first stage of the Singrauli and Korba developments, in the
case of the 200 MW units, and for the Trombay Project, in the case of the 500
MW units. Prices were escalated to 1979 levels. Transmission costs are
equally based on estimates received for the 400 kV transmission associated
with the first stage of the Singrauli development and on the costs of 400 kV
construction at various locations in India. Physical contingencies of 10% on
civil works, and of 5% on plant and transmission costs have been allowed to
provide for unforeseeable factors. In assessing price contingencies, it has
been assumed that fixed price contracts and contracts with ceilings on price
inflation for turbogenerators and boilers, as in the case of NTPC's three other
power plants under construction, will also be obtainable in the case of the
Second Singrauli Project. Costs for equipment and erection have been escalated
at 6% for 1979, 10% for 1980, 7% for the years 1981-1983 and 5% for the years
after 1983. These assumptions have resulted in price contingencies of 24% for
civil works, 36% for supply and erection of electrical and mechanical equipment,
32% for supply and erection of coal handling and transportation equipment, and
31% for supply of materials and erection of the transmission system.
Project Financing
3.07      The proposed credit of US$300 million representing about 35% of the
cost of the project (excluding duties and taxes and interest during construc-
tion), should be applied to the CIF and/or ex-factory costs of plant and
equipment, excluding the 2 x 500 MW turbogenerators and associated equipment.
The latter would be financed by Kredit fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) from Germany
which has been requested by GOI, and in principle has agreed, to extend a
loan of about US$100 million equivalent to support the proposed project in
financing the 500 MW turbo-generator units. Civil works, plant erection costs,
inland transportation costs, interest during construction, duties and taxes
and any other costs not financed from the credit and KfW, aggregating about
US$694 million, would be financed by GOI in the form of loan and equity
capital. Retroactive financing of up to US$15 million, to allow NTPC to
exercise its option for a repeat order for the two 200 MW turbogenerators and
boilers, is proposed.
Engineering and Construction
3.08      As in the case of the first stage, the second stage of the Singrauli
development comprises a number of major works which must be carefully coordi-
nated to ensure efficient progress. The power plant is expected to be com-
pleted by February 1987. The project construction schedule is shown in Annex 15.
Much of the detailed power station engineering and design work carried out for
the first stage is applicable to the second stage. Under previous credits and
loan granted for NTPC's program, consultants were appointed for the 200 MW
units to: (i) review NTPC's basic engineering and design; (ii) assist in the
more sophisticated areas of design; and (iii) provide a back up review of
specifications for generating units, boilers, transformers and other specifi-
cations, as required by NTPC and the Association. NTPC has acquired adequate
experience in the area of design and engineering of 200 MW units, especially



- 20 -
from the first stage of the Singrauli power plant, and therefore there is no
need to appoint consultants for the engineering of the 200 MW units. As for
the 500 MW sets which are being installed for the first time in India, GOI and
NTPC have agreed during negotiations as a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed credit, to engage consultants acceptable to the Association to assist
in the design, the preparation of specifications and bidding documents and the
evaluation of bids for the 2 x 500 MW part of the project.
3.09      NTPC, under its competent chairman, has developed a comprehensive
project management system, including program coordination and supervision of
construction of the power stations. However, in view of the magnitude of its
construction program, NTPC has agreed to conclude, as a condition of credit
effectiveness, all contractual arrangements for the employment of consultants
to review its project management and information systems and their initial
implementation.
3.10      Under the first Singrauli Project, GOI agreed to take the necessary
steps to make available adequate coal supplies for the 600 MW stage of the
power plant by the time the first generating unit shall have been commissioned.
These measures should be extended under the proposed project for the final
installed capacity of the power plant. Agreements to this effect were reached
during negotiations.
Procurement
3.11      Procurement of all equipment to be financed from the proposed credit,
with the exception of the 200 MW units including turbogenerators and boilers,
would be on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Association's guidelines. For the procurement of the 200 MW turbo-generator
sets and boilers, the Association has agreed, in view of the expected cost and
time savings, that NTPC should exercise the option under the contract for the
first Singrauli project, which was awarded after international competitive
bidding. Documents for individual contracts above US$1,500,000 equivalent
would be subject to prior review by the Association. Bidding documents for
such equipment, including tender analyses and recommendations for award of
contracts, would be prepared by NTPC with the assistance of its consultants,
and approved by the Association. To facilitate contract coordination, the
invitation to tender for major plant contracts would be on a supply, deliver
and erect basis. This could include civil works in certain cases where these
cannot be disassociated from the plant contract--i.e., coal handling, substa-
tion structures, transmission lines, but such civil works would not be financed
from the proposed credit. Local manufacturers would be expected to bid for
all categories of equipment. A domestic preference of 15% or the import duty,
whichever is less, would be applied in bid comparison for equipment contracts.
To prevent administrative procurement delays, in case the lowest evaluated
bidder is a foreign manufacturer, GOI agreed during negotiations that it would
grant import permissions for such items without further review by any agency
of the Government. There are competent local contracting firms in India and
also manufacturing facilities covering most of the equipment for the project.
All goods not financed from the proposed credit (and from the KfW loan) will
be subject to local procurement procedures, which are satisfactory.



- 21 -
Disbursements
3.12      Disbursements from the proposed credit would be made against 100%
of the cost of consultants retained for the 500 MW units (see para 3.08) and
to review NTPC's project management systems (see para 3.09), and against the
cost of the equipment to be financed from the proposed credit on the following
basis:
(a) 100% of the ex-factory cost of equipment procured in
India after international competitive bidding; and
(b) 100% of the foreign cost of equipment procured from
abroad.
Any balance of the credit not used after commitments have been made for all
items covered by the list of goods, could be used to purchase other electrical
and mechanical equipment for the project, after obtaining the Association's
agreement. Retroactive financing of up to US$15 million is proposed for ex-
penditures after August 1, 1979, made to allow NTPC to exercise its option
for a repeat order for the two 200 MW turbogenerators and boilers (para 3.11).
The estimated disbursement schedule is given in Annex 16.
Ecological Aspects
3.13      The ecological and environmental aspects of the project were dis-
cussed during appraisal. GOI confirmed that the Singrauli development had
received the approval of the Indian National Committee on Environmental Plan-
ning and NTPC agreed to comply with all environmental quality standards
prescribed by this committee in the design, construction and operation of
the project.
3.14      As in the case of the first stage of the Singrauli development, the
principal environmental problems with the proposed project are: (a) location,
(b) stack emissions, (c) heat dissipation, and (d) ash disposal. These are
outlined below:
(a) Location. The proposed Singrauli power station is a pit
head station and is situated far from any urban area.
Accordingly, there are no problems other than the need to
ensure the health and environment of the operating staff
who will be housed in a residential area to be constructed
some 4 or 5 km from the power station.
(b) Stack Emissions. Electrostatic precipitators will be in-
stalled and the stack will be of such a height that emitted
particulate matter will be spread over a sufficiently wide
area to reduce the density of pollutants to an acceptable
level. The sulphur content of the coal is in the range of
0.3% to 0.6% which is low and does not present a pollution
problem.
(c) Heat Dissipation. The cooling pond is designed to ensure
that its average temperature increase will not exceed 3%
with the station under full operation. This would have
no adverse effect on fisheries.



- 22 -
(d) Ash Disposal. The ash will be pumped as a slurry, through
a 5 km pipeline, to an ash dump area which has been reclaimed
from the Rihand Reservoir. The area will be enclosed by a
bund, and together with a reserve area, will be adequate to
contain the ash output for the life of the power station.
3.15      With regard to the safety and occupational health of employees,
safety regulations for power stations, to which all operating personnel must
conform, will be strictly enforced. As far as noise levels are concerned
the turbine hall of a modern steam turbine power station, which is the noisi-
est area of the plant, has a sound pressure level of less than 90 decibels
which is well below the maximum acceptable threshold for the normal 8 hour/day
shift worker.
Project Risks
3.16      The project represents one phase of an overall development program
which comprises 7,300 MW of generating plant and some 7,000 km of 400 kV
transmission. It is part of a tightly designed program with plant and trans-
mission coming in at phased intervals throughout the period 1982 through 1988.
Maintaining this program on schedule requires careful coordination and expert
supervision at all levels. The principal risk is the possibility of slippage
which could give rise to delayed commissioning of plant and loss of revenues.
With a program of construction of this magnitude, there is no guarantee that
some delays will not occur, but these will be kept to a minimum through care-
ful coordination and supervision during construction and careful attention,
when placing contracts, to the capability of manufacturers to meet the delivery
schedules.
3.17      Other risk areas are in engineering design, cost overruns and prob-
lems of commissioning and operation during the early operational stage with
resultant loss of revenues. There is also the risk of damage due to fire,
explosion, etc., but this is covered by insurance provided by the respective
contractors during the construction stage and by GOI through its self-insurance
policy after commissioning.
3.18      These risks have been carefully assessed and the following safe-
guards taken:
(a) NTPC is being assisted by consultants and sub-
consultants, and this should minimize problems
due to error at the engineering and design stage;
(b) Plant and equipment cost are based on similar works
currently in progress in India; provision has been
made for cost escalation and there should be little
risk of any substantial cost overrun;
(c) a number of 200 MW generating units will have been
in operation for some years before the project is
commissioned, thus, providing experience and trained
manpower for the project.

IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
4.01      Financial forecasts of NTPC's annual operations through FY91 are
presented in Annexes 17 through 19. The forecasts are based on a capital
investment program (Annex 18, page 2) which envisages the construction of four
large thermal power stations with a combined capacity of 7,300 MW, together
with almost 7,000 circuit kilometers of 400 KV transmission lines at a latest
estimated cost of Rs 48 billion (US$5,714 million equivalent). The power
stations and transmission lines will be commissioned on a phased basis during
the period February 1982 to July 1989.
4.02      Concurrently with this construction program, NTPC is responsible for
the operation and development of the Badarpur power station in Delhi. This
involves directing operations of the 510 MW thermal generating plant (initial
300 MW plus 210 MW extension constructed and commissioned by NTPC), and for
construction of a further 210 MW extension already sanctioned and due for
commissioning in September 1981.
Future Earnings
4.03      NTPC will become operational in February 1982 when its first 200 MW
generating unit at Singrauli is expected to be commissioned. Additional gene-
rating capacity scheduled for commercial operation during the succeeding seven
year period, is set out in Annex 20, page 1, paragraph 2(a). NTPC's projected
earnings are based on the assumption that NTPC would supply bulk power at 400 kV
to State Electricity Boards at a tariff level which would enable it to earn a
reasonable return on its investment. This was defined in connection with
previous credits and loan as being a tariff level sufficient to produce a
rate of return of not less than 9.5% on the book value of the average net
fixed assets in service in FY1989 1/, and applied from the time of commis-
sioning of the first generating unit in Singrauli in 1981/82 2/.
4.04      Several changes were necessary in, a number of assumptions underlying
NTPC's financial projections, because of: slippage in the commissioning dates
of operating plant, release of GOI funds as equity capital in the earlier
years, followed by loan capital in later years and cost revisions in the
overall investment program. The effects of these changes are to:
1/   The first fiscal year in which all generating units at Singrauli were
projected to operate at 5,500 hours a year.
2/   There are no requirements within India either statutorily or for commer-
cial accounting purposes, to note fixed asset and depreciation data at
current price levels. The equivalent in real terms of a 9.5% rate of
return on an historic rate base in FY1989 is about 7.5%.



- 24 -
(a) increase the bulk selling price by 12% over the level
estimated at the Ramagunda appraisal, bringing it to
just over 29 paise/kWh;
(b) eliminate losses during the initial years of operation; and
(c) reduce by some 5% the overall cost of the investment program.
4.05      The income statement (Annex 17) shows the projected earnings per-
formance for FY1982 through FY1991. Mainly because of a substantially reduced
interest charge, resulting from the revised financing arrangement referred to
at paragraph 4.04, NTPC will become profitable in its first year of commercial
operation, FY1982. Earnings will rise rapidly thereafter, following the rapid
commissioning of plant from FY1984 through FY1989, and will reach the stipu-
lated rate of return of 9.5% in FY1989, rising to 11.4% by FY1991. Internal
resources will generously cover debt service requirements in the initial years
FY1982-FY1986 and adequately thereafter.
4.06      The regulation of NTPC's annual earnings is a function imposed on
GOI by the amendment to Section 75A of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948.
Under the amendment, GOI is required to specify the quantum of annual surplus
which should be earned so as to provide from internal resources a reasonable
contribution to capital investment, and to pay dividends on the equity capital.
Under present assumptions, NTPC's internal resources would not be adequate to
meet these commitments until FY1988. During negotiations, GOI confirmed that
while NTPC's surplus would be regulated from the time NTPC became revenue earn-
ing (FY1982) the appropriate amount of surplus would depend, in part, upon
NTPC's future investment program at that time. It was thus premature to spe-
cify a surplus at this stage. However, the 9.5% rate of return would be
retained as a minimum requirement in FY1989 and thereafter.
4.07      As in earlier credits and loan, it has been restated for this pro-
posed credit that NTPC would achieve in FY1989 and maintain thereafter a
rate of return not less than 9.5% on net fixed assets in operation, and to
set tariffs from the time the first generating unit at Singrauli is commis-
sioned, at levels not lower than estimated to achieve the required 9.5% rate
of return in FY1989.
Taxation
4.08      NTPC is liable for income tax under the Indian Income Tax Acts.
Because of the large capital expenditure program between FY1979 and FY1988
liability to tax will not arise in the foreseeable future and a tax equaliza-
tion reserve is not necessary.
Financing Plan FY1977-FY1987
4.09      The following table sets out the financing plan for the eleven-year
period FY1977 through FY1987 (the year during which the project is scheduled
for completion):

4.10      The financing plan provides for the construction of the ongoing
First Singrauli, Korba, and Ramagundam Projects, the proposed Second Singrauli
Project, and the tentative Farakka Project together with the balance of the
generation and transmission construction program, during the project construc-
tion period. GOI is expected to request additional financial assistance for
the balance of the program. The cost of the proposed Second Singrauli Project
represents almost 18% of construction expenditure in the financing plan. GOI
would provide the capital required by NTPC in the form of debt and equity in
a ratio not exceeding 1:1.
4.11      The proposed IDA credit of US$300 million would be relent to NTPC
in accordance with an acceptable onlending agreement, as a condition of
effectiveness of the credit. As in previous operations, the terms of the
on-lending agreement would provide for final maturity in 20 years, including
a grace period of 5 years, and repayment of principal in equal semiannual
installments, with interest payable on outstanding loans at 10.25% per annum.
This is the rate of interest at which GOI currently lends to industrial and
commercial undertakings in the public sector, and compares with about 16%



- 26 -
charged by domestic lending institutions for similar types of lending. The
foreign exchange risk would be borne by the Government. GOI has invited KfW
to assist in the financing Df th- Project   It is likely that the latter will
finance the 2 .. 500 MW turbogenerators and associated equipment to the extent
of approximately US$100 million. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that GOI will provide the balance of the capital needed to complete the project
on terms satisfactory to the Association.
4.12      IDA financing of the proposed Second Singrauli Project, US$300
million, together with Bank Group financing of the first stage development
of each of the Singrauli, Korba and Ramagundam stations, US$600 million, in
aggregate US$900 million, represents some 40% of the total costs involved,
excluding duties, taxes, and interest charged to construction.
Internal Cash Generation
4.13      The Source and Application of Funds Statement presented in Annex
18 shows the rapid buildup of internally generated funds from the time NTPC
becomes revenue earning in February 1982. An unusually high debt service
coverage of 9 times and 6 times in FYs1982 and 1983, respectively, is caused
by the mainly equity financing in those years. Financing by means of loan
capital in succ,eding years reduces the coverage ratio to a more balanced
level reaching 1.7 times in FY1987, when the total Singrauli development would
be commissioned.
4.14      The level of internal cash generated is determined by the assump-
tions made in the financial projections (Annex 20). Surplus funds arise
in FY1988 and accelerate rapidly thereafter. It is reasonable to assume
that having reached a sat-isfactory level of financial viability, NTPC would
be expected to commence paying dividends on its equity share capital. This
is a decision which will have to be made by GOI in due course, and will be
influenced by decisions on whether or not to expand the activities of NTPC
beyond the current investment program. A decision could also be made to pay
off GOI loans in advance of their maturity, thereby saving interest and
improving NTPC's profitability.
Future Finances
4.15      Forecast condensed balance sheets through FY1991 are presented in
Annex 19. The balance sheets reflect the build-up of the construction pro-
gram, the commencement of commercial operations in February 1982, and the
financing of NTPC's capital requirements by GOI through a combination of long
term borrowing and equity capital, so as not to exceed a debt/equity ratio of
1:1, with equity being released initially followed by loan capital later.
Table 4.2 below shows NTPC's projected financial position at three significant
points in its development:
(a) at March 31, 1982 - end of year when NTPC becomes revenue
earning;
(b) at March 31, 1987 - end of year following commissioning of
the proposed Second Singrauli Project; and



- 27 -
(c) at March 31, 1991 - end of year in which the Singrauli
Station (2,000 MW) would be operating 5,500 hours a year.

4.16      The above table shows that by March 31, 1982, just after the point
at which NTPC becomes revenue earning, total capitalization would be about
Rs 14,000 million (US$1,667 million), with a debt/equity ratio of 2/98.
Five years later - end of FY1987, after the Second Singrauli Project would
be commissioned - total capitalization would have more than tripled to about
Rs 45,000 million (US$5,357 million) with a debt/equity ratio of 46/54. Over
60% of the construction program will have been completed at this time. By
March 31, 1991, when the balance of the construction program would be completed
and Singrauli station operating at 5,500 hours per year, capitalization would
be about Rs 48,000 million (US$5,714 million) with an improvement in the debt/
equity ratio to 34/66. The improvement in the debt/equity ratio between FY1987
and FY1991 reflects the assumed cessation of expansion and its associated
financing, combined with significant increases in the level of retained earn-
ings, caused by improved profit volume. NTPC's authorized share capital would
be raised progressively during the period FY1981 through FY1987 (Annex 19) to
reach a figure of about Rs 22,000 million (US$2,620 million). It is currently
Rs 3,000 million (US$357 million).



- 28 -
4.17      The level of working capital in NTPC's balance sheet assumes that
its customers (SEBs) would have credit terms of 30 days. Monthly billings
for energy sold would be running at the rate of almost US$3 million in FY1983,
US$47 million in FY1987 and US$116 million in FY1991. Accordingly, delay in
payment of accounts by SEBs would adversely affect NTPC finances. This is
not regarded by NTPC as a serious problem because, under existing circumstances
in India, credit terms of less than 30 days for interstate transfers are com-
mon. In addition, penalties for late payment of accounts would be imposed.
Further reference to this subject will be made during dialogue with GOI and
NTPC on the bulk tariff issue (para 4.19).
Borrowing Powers
4.18      The Companies Act 1956 (Section 293.1(d)) restricts borrowing by
NTPC to within a sum equal to the aggregate of the paid up share capital and
the "free reserves" (i.e., those not set apart for a specific purpose) except
with the consent of the corporation in general meeting. During negotiations
NTPC agreed to inform the Association beforehand of any proposal to alter or
modify existing limitations on the borrowing powers of its Board of Directors.
NTPC's Bulk Tariff
4.19      This is a matter which was first discussed during the appraisal and
negotiation of the First Singrauli Project (Credit 685-iN). Since the first
200 MW unit was not scheduled to come into commercial operation until early
calendar year 1982, this matter has awaited the formulation by GOI and NTPC
of the strategy for the sale of power from the central thermal power stations.
The dialogue was resumed at negotiations of the Ramagundam Project (Credit
874-IN and Loan 1648-IN) and continued during appraisal of the Second Singrauli
Project. Subjects discussed included the regionalization of the bulk tariff;
the form of contract with SEBs and REBs, covering operating practices, finan-
cial requirements, arrangements for settlement of disputes; and the structure
of proposed tariff. These matters are discussed in more detail in the follow-
ing paragraphs.
Regional Tariffs
4.20      There appears to be a valid case for regionalizing NTPC's bulk tariff
to better reflect the nature of the individual NTPC thermal power stations as
integral parts of regional power systems, at least until a national power
grid is established. This could be achieved in a manner compatible with
NTPC's tariff covenant with the Association (para 4.07). If the total capital
base at FY1989 was broken down over each of the four stations and operating
costs and revenues for the various years similarly allocated, a bulk tariff
for each station in each region would emerge. This exurJis was undertaken
during appraisal and produced the following approximate bulk tariffs:

Paise/kWh 1/
Singrauli (Northern Region)                23
Korba (Western Region)                     31

Farakka (Eastern Region)                   32
Average (All Regions)                      29
A comparison of the Singrauli bulk tariff with bulk exchange tariffs in the
Northern Region is contained in Annex 22.
Commercial Arrangements for Sale of NTPC Power
4.21      NTPC has prepared a draft contract for the sale of its power to its
customers in the Northern Region (mostly SEBs). The draft explains the manner
in which power (including NTPC's) would be distributed to individual customers
in the region through the Regional Load of Dispatch Centers, the commercial
and financial arrangements for the sale of NTPC's power, and the arrangements
for the settlement of disputes. During negotations, GOI confirmed that NTPC's
draft contract was being examined in the context of a proposal to study the
feasibility of a common agency selling power from all central projects in a
region to SEBs at a common rate, so as to optimize operation of regional
systems. The feasibility and the several technical, operational, commercial
and institutional aspects of this proposal needed examination. Once a view
had been taken on the concept of a pooled tariff for central generation in a
region, NTPC's commercial arrangements for the sale of its power would be
finalized. It was recognized that this would need to be some months before
the start of commercial operation of the first NTPC unit which was scheduled
for February 1982. Continuing dialogue would be maintained with the Associa-
tion on this subject.
Tariff Level and Marginal Cost
4.22      At the present time, while no output will be sold by NTPC for sev-
eral years to come, it is irrelevant to talk of marginal cost-based tariffs
at 1979 levels. NTPC is not an existing expanding system, but has to be
treated as the beginning of such a supply system. By definition, practically
all costs of the system known in 1979 are future, marginal costs of supplying
incremental demand. In order to arrive at marginal costs in future years when
power is actually sold, assumptions about the future expansion and operation
of the system, and about inflation expectations have to be made (Annex 23,
pages 1 through 5).
1/   While interest during construction has been calculated on a "total
company" basis, some inequities may emerge in allocating of the interest
to individual stations, due to the fact that loans as distinct from
equity finance may have been allocated to specific plants, on a "first
in-first out" basis, whereas it might be more equitable to allocate
interest on an "average cost of capital basis". The figures above would
require some adjustment if this were the assumption. Nevertheless they
are useful for purposes of illustration.



- 30 -
4.23      Assuming that capacity expansion investment will continue for the
foreseeable future in line with growing demand, and that, ultimately, NTPC
will be operating at the limit of its capacity, the estimates of marginal-cost-
based tariffs for 1984/85, the first year of operation of all four stations
range from 35 to 37 paise/kWh (USJ4.1-4.4) as a one-part tariff, and Rs 935-
1,022/kW/year (US$111-122) plus 9.3-11.2 paise/kWh (WScl.1-1.3) as a two-part
tariff 1/ (Annex 23, page 6). The discrepancy between these figures and the
financially justified tariff levels (para 4.20) is, of course, attributable
to the fact that present financial projections are based on investment
tapering off in the later years, while the marginal cost concept assumes
that additional investment will be necessary to accommodate any incremental
demand.
4.24      Notwithstanding the limitations of the marginal cost approach, it
will be necessary to consider it as an input into tariff construction in later
years, when marginal cost will start exceeding the financial tariff that is
planned to remain fixed in absolute terms throughout the projection period.
Any intention to expand NTPC operations after the late 1980's or an integra-
tion of NTPC capacity into a future national generating authority will have
to take into account the need to provide for future investment and to post
proper price signals to SEBs and consumers. By the mid-1980's, the time will
have arrived to adjust the bulk tariff upwards in line with marginal cost.
This will be particularly relevant for the Singrauli station (Northern Region),
where the projected financial tariff level would be as low as 23 paise/kwh
compared to a marginal-cost based tariff of 35 paise.
V. JUSTIFICATION
Project Definition
5.01      The proposed project 2/ is justified as the least-cost solution
available to meet part of forecast demand in the Northern Region within a
limited time frame.
Comparison of Alternatives
5.02      Given the existing and forecast power shortages in the Northern
region, the need for additional capacity in the shortest possible time is
urgent (para 1.31). This short-term capacity of the required size can only
be provided by thermal plant with a sufficiently short gestation period.
Possible new hydro sites require extensive engineering studies, and those
hydro projects that could yield available capacity within a reasonable time
1/   Total capital cost recovered in fixed charge.
2/   For purposes of justification, the project is defined as the expansion by
1,400 MW of the first 600 MW stage of the Singrauli thermal power station.



- 31 -
are designed to meet another part of future demand as part of the concurrent
SEB investment plan. The justification of the complete 2,000 MW development
at the time of appraisal of the first stage, was based on the fact that any
ready hydro potential was already included to be developed in parallel with
Singrauli. The nuclear alternative was excluded because of the long gestation
period.
5.03      In continuation of the approach used in the analysis of realistic
alternatives at the time of first stage appraisal, the only solution that
could yield available energy at the same time as the incremental 1,400 MW of
Singrauli would be a combination of new smaller coal-fired plant and expan-
sion of existing stations, undertaken by the regional SEBs individually.
The theoretically most attractive solution to provide equivalent thermal
capacity quickly is the expansion of existing sites. Two obstacles to this
are evident in the Northern Region: (a) the expansion potential of existing
stations is limited, or allocated to be developed concurrently with Singrauli;
(b) the Singrauli expansion cost of about Rs 3.3 million/MW (in 1979 market
prices) (US$0.39 million) is lower than the average cost of installing
scattered new capacity in the region, amounting to about Rs 3.7 million/MW
(US$0.44 million).
5.04      The alternative consisting of smaller stations would encompass three
new sites (a pithead site in Uttar Pradesh near the Singrauli site, and two
sites in Punjab and Haryana), and two expansions of existing stations (Kota
in Rajasthan, and Badarpur for Delhi), with an aggregate capacity equal to
that of the proposed project. With the exception of the Uttar Pradesh site,
all locations would require transport of coal. The largest station (630 MW)
would supply Uttar Pradesh; the remaining stations range from 110 MW to 220 MW
(Annex 24).
5.05      As the transmission cost included in the proposed project cost is
designed to serve not only for the evacuation of Singrauli power, but also
for other energy flows in the region, an allowance for some additional trans-
mission investment has been made in the cost of the alternative solution.
This includes not only the transmission necessary for the evacuation of
power from the Uttar Pradesh pithead station, but also the "regional" element
(Annex 25).
5.06      The costs of both the project and its alternative have been phased
to provide capacity and energy in the same pattern (Annex 29). All costs are
expressed in economic terms, i.e. in CIF/FOB prices where available and ad-
justed by the appropriate conversion factors to border prices where necessary.
Unskilled labor has been shadow priced at 75% of the market wage, skilled
labor at full market wage. The economic cost of coal has been derived from
production cost expressed in border prices (Annexes 26 and 27).
5.07      The present value of the cost stream of the project is lower than
that of the alternative at any discount rate. The project, therefore, consti-
tutes the least cost solution for satisfying the future 1,400 MW portion of
demand in the Northern Region gradually from 1985 onwards. Annex 30 shows
the present values of the cost streams of the project and of the alternative
assuming opportunity cost of capital of 10% as the discount rate, with as a



- 32 -
sensitivity test a discount rate of 13%. The results show the advantage of
the project over its alternative (Rs 1,075 million (US$128 million) at 10%
discount rate, and Rs 792 million (US$94 million) at 13% discount rate). The
cost differentials in the base case increases slightly if the cc;t of capital
goods is increased, and decreases slightly if this cost decreases. The cost
advantage of the project rises with higher fuel cost.
Benefits
5.08       Quantification of economic benefits arising from the implementation
of an expansion of generating plant integrated into an existing and growing
system is not easily established. A two-stage approximation approach has
been adopted for the proposed project: (a) average retail tariffs in the
region have been assumed to represent a proxy for the minimum observed will-
ingness of consumers to pay for power; and (b) in order to quantify any addi-
tional consumer surplus beyond this minimum, the cost incurred by industry
in maintaining and operating standby generating sets has been assumed to
represent a proxy for industrial consumers' willingness to pay for continuous
power supply (Annex 28).
5.09       Corresponding to the definition of benefits as willingness to pay
at the retail level, additional costs of transmission and distribution invest-
ment as well as for operation and maintenance have been allocated to project
cost in line with the general regional incremental investment pattern. This
additional cost is net of the transmission element already included in the
project cost. The incremental amount of energy sold has been adjusted to
account for system losses typical for the region (Annex 25).
5.10       The weighted average of tariff revenue at retail level in the
Northern Region has been established at 26.4 paise/kWh in 1979 prices, and
converted to border prices for purposes of the comparison with economic
cost. The industrial tariff revenue is replaced by the observed average
willingness to pay for continuous power supply. 1/ The minimum economic
internal rate of return is about 13%, rising to 16% if outages are more
frequent and standby sets utilized more (Annex 30).
5.12       The internal economic rate of return is likely to be considerably
higher than the minimum quantifiable estimate of 13%, if the derived consumers'
and producers' surplus of industrial, agricultural and commercial output made
possible by the alleviation of shortages is taken into account and if indirect
benefits accruing to the Indian economy would be fully considered. Benefits
accruing to domestic consumers are understated by the use of the tariff as
benefit. The conclusion that can be drawn from the exercise using retail
tariffs only, is that regional tariffs charged final consumers are slightly
inadequate to recover the incremental cost of the project.
1/   The average cost of grid supply together with the operation of diesel
standby generating sets during power outages has been established as
about 37 paisa/kWh as opposed to the weighted average regional industrial
tariff of 25 paisa/kWh (22 paisa in economic terms), given typical
utilization rates of standby sets (Annex 28).

Regional Demand and Supply (Northern Region)
1.        Of all energy flows in the region, about 45% (including Bhakra/Beas
share distribution) are accounted for by inter-authority transfers. Similarly,
about one-third of total capacity demand at peak is made available as inter-
authority exchange (Annex 10).
2.        Estimated total energy consumption in the region 1978/79 was
20,062 GWh (at final consumer level); estimated maximum regional coincident
peak demand during the same fiscal year was 4,796 MW. This represents a
large increase of 20% (3,347 GWh) in terms of energy, and an increase by 8%
(356 MW) in terms of capacity over the previous year. The large jump in
energy sales can be explained by an exceptionally high availability level of
hydro capacity following a good monsoon, while 1977/78 had actually experienced
a decrease in energy sales. The importance of the hydro element in the fluc-
tuations can be observed in the fact that States heavily dependent on hydro
generation (Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir) have recorded energy sale
increases of up to 25%, while Uttar Pradesh with its predominantly thermal
capacity shows an increase of about 10%.
3.        In March 1979, 49% of installed regional capacity consisted of
thermal plant, 3% of nuclear and 48% of hydro. The high dependence on hydro
capacity makes the region vulnerable to fluctuations in water levels, but
also provides it with desirable peaking capacity for future, shortage-free
years. The degree of reliance on hydro varies within the region (Project
File Working Papers):

4.        Diversity within the Region is not very pronounced, the diversity
factor ranging from unity to 1.048 (Project File Working Papers)). By far,
the largest supplying authority is UPSEB, accounting for 40% of total
installed capacity, followed by Punjab with about 20% (including its hydro
share). In terms of firm available capacity at the peak, Uttar Pradesh also
provides 40%, while Punjab's share is about 18%. UPSEB's share of potential
unconstrained peak demand would be even slightly higher at 41% of the esti-
mated regional total. In 1978/79, the net imports of energy from outside
the region were negligible, mainly confined to minor local exchanges with
Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. In effect, therefore, the region operates as a
self-contained system.
5.        The pattern of electricity consumption in the region shows a pre-
dominance of industry, but to a much lesser extent than the All-India average:
industry accounts for 52% of consumption, against a national average of about
62%. Agriculture, on the other hand, occupies a large share of consumption in
the region (26% as against a national average of about 15%, (Annex 3)). The
region, therefore, is subject to the disadvantages of high agricultural demand,
such as pronounced peaks in the daily load curve, low load factor, and high
system losses in distribution. Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh are
States with a relatively high degree of industrial consumption, while the
other States show a more even split between industry and agriculture. Over
the period 1974-79, the pattern of consumption has remained approximately
constant, and no major changes in the composition of consumption are expected.
6.        During recent years, installed capacity in the region has been
increasing at a rate of about 13% per year to reach 7,769 MW in March 1979.
Firm available capacity, however, has been increasing only at a rate of about
9% per year, falling to 62% of installed capacity from 73% in 1973/74. DESU
is the only supply authority in the region whose plant availability factor
has not deteriorated severely since 1976: rapidly rising installed capacity
is not reflected in similarly increasing ability to meet peak demand. An
increase in availability approaching 70% is expected for future years after
present difficulties with forced outages are overcome.
7.        In terms of energy, consumption has been growing at approximately
14.5% per year for the five years up to 1978/79, with growth rates of up to
25% for years with good hydro availability. Growth of sales over time has
been uniform throughout the region. Energy available to be sent out, however,
has been growing only at a rate of about 13% during the same period: some
progress in reducing the high system losses is evident.
Future Development
8.        By 1983/84, an additional 4,820 MW (plus 62%) are expected to have
been added to regional capacity installed in March 1979. 3,059 MW (63%) of
this increase will be accounted for by UPSEB and the Central Sector (mainly
NTPC) together. Presently available plans indicate a further increase of
about 3,000 MW between 1984 and 1988, and new capacity amounting to 665 MW
already sanctioned to come on stream after 1988. About 25% of total new



- 37 -
ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 10 pages
capacity to be commissioned between 1980 and 1988 is attributable to the
Singrauli development. About 70% of new capacity to be available by 1983/84
will be thermal and nuclear thus shifting the regional balance somewhat away
from excessive dependence on hydro capacity. This trend is expected to con-
tinue until 1988: new capacity in the region will be 75% thermal. Annex 2,
pages 7-10 indicates the planned investment program at its latest status in
June 1979.
9.        The basis for this capacity extension plan is the demand forecast-
ing conducted in the form of the periodical comprehensive power surveys
("Annual Power Surveys") by the CEA, and amended by deliberations of the
Planning Commission, SEBs, and National Development Council. At the time of
publication of the tenth APS in 1977, it was envisaged that about 5,530 MW
of an unconstrained potential peak load demand of almost 6,000 MW in 1978/79
would be met. Actual estimated peak availability in that year, however, was
only about 4,800 MW. All demand forecasts have now been scaled down by the
Planning Commission's Working Group: unconstrained potential peak load
demand in 1983/84 is now estimated to be about 9,130 MW (a reduction by 10%
from the tenth APS estimate), 8,320 MW of which are expected to be met by
available plant. The anticipated capacity shortfall will be growing steadily
over the five years to reach more than 800 MW in 1983/84.
10.       A possible variation in the forecast capacity and energy require-
ment is introduced by consideration of future new industrial consumers and
future agricultural demand. Differences of opinion on the extent of demand
attributable to new high-voltage industries exist between the Planning Commis-
sion, the APS, and the SEBs. Macro-economic considerations of the Planning
Commission have led to a reduction of the bulk provision for industries likely
to be licensed in the future. On the other hand, the SEBs' micro-economic
forecasts are consistently higher than either the APS or the Planning Commis-
sion estimates. Annex 2 page 10 illustrates the range of recent forecasts for
two States in the Northern region (Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan): the estimate
for potential unconstrained peak demand in 1983/84 ranges from 3,997 MW to
4,957 MW for Uttar Pradesh, and from 1,186 MW to 1,600 MW for Rajasthan. In
the years beyond 1984, the range increases. Correspondingly, the forecasts of
annual energy demand are spread over a wide range. The significance of the
disparity becomes clear in its effect on future shortages: the Working Group's
estimate for Rajasthan,, for example, forecasts a slight capacity surplus from
1980/81 onwards; RSEB's estimates would result in continuing capacity short-
falls. This is reflected in the tentative RSEB projections of new available
capacity, which exceed the CEA's by about 260 MW until 1983/84.
11.       Neither forecast can be based on recent data, all of which are
constrained by shortages. For planning purposes, the latest estimates of the
Planning Commission's Working Group, which are also the lowest so far, are
being used (Annex 4). Further tentative projections of demand by the CEA,
which are not universally accepted as of now, indicate a growth of potential
peak load demand in the Region by about 11% per year, to reach about 15,350 MW
by 1988/89. Similarly, the potential energy requirement is expected to grow
at a similar rate to about 80,000 GWh (Annex 5). Firmer forecasts will be
available after the ongoing eleventh APS is finalized early in 1980.

ANNEX 2
Page 4 of 10 pages
12.       Resource constraints and slippage in implementation of projects
are expected to reduce the target of additional capacity installation:
preliminary estimates envisage a figure of total capacity installed by
1982/83 which is about 7% lower than anticipated by the Working Group.
It is likely, therefore, that persistent shortages at peak times are going
to be more pronounced, and will continue well beyond 1984, even under the
lowest assumption of demand growth.
13.       The investment expenditure in the region necessary to reach the
physical targets for 1982/83 is estimated to be about Rs 43,935 million
(US$230 million) for the fiscal years 1979/80 to 1982/83. The bulk (60%)
of this expenditure will be allocated to Uttar Pradesh (including the NTPC
Singrauli development), the State with the largest anticipated peak load
shortfall. About 60% will be attributable to generation, the remainder to
transmission, distribution and rural electrification.  Except for UPSEB,
most States in the region will devote smaller percentages of their investment
to generation, reflecting the shifting of some of the responsibility for
generation development from the States to NTPC (Annex 7).
Shortages and Restrictions
14.       During 1978/79, only Punjab and some of the smaller supply areas
were relatively free of shortages. All other supply authorities had to
impose restrictions on unconstrained demand to avoid large-scale breakdowns
at peak. In addition, the regional dependence on hydro generation leads to
the need to impose a maximum on the monthly energy consumption. UPSEB is
continuing to impose the following major restrictions on its consumers:
(i) non-continuous industries do not get supply at the four
hours of evening peak;
(ii) many continuous industries suffer a 50% cut in capacity
availability and energy consumption; if they have at
least 50% captive capacity, the cut is 100%;
(iii) rural feeder lines are interrupted for 3 hours, 3 days
per week; and
(iv) commercial establishments business hours are limited to
9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
It is notable that domestic and rural consumers are guaranteed almost con-
tinuous supply, while industry is bearing the brunt of the shortages.
15.       The other supply authorities resort to less drastic restrictions
of their industrial consumers' demand. The usual restrictions are the non-
supply to industry during the evening peak (about 6 to 10 p.m.), and an
overall cut in monthly energy allocation by 5-10%. Rotation of supply to
individual rural feeders during the day is also widespread. In addition
to these planned restrictions, ad hoc load shedding becomes necessary in
the case of local plant or distribution breakdowns.

The Project in the Regional Context
16.       As Singrauli capacity gradually comes on stream between 1981/82
and 1986/87, shares of this capacity will be allocated to individual supply
authorities. Fifteen percent of total capacity will remain unallocated to
satisfactory demand where needed on an ad hoc basis. UPSEB will be receiving
50% of allocated capacity.  Annex 6 illustrates the planned build-up of allo-
cations of capacity and energy in the region. At the time of fully available
Singrauli capacity, the complete project (including the first 600 MW stage)
will represent about 15% of regional potential unrestricted demand. In
1983/84, the latest year for which accepted regional capacity forecasts are
available, Singrauli capacity will be the equivalent of 8% of total regional
capacity. If a high firm availability of the project is assumed, its share
of capacity actually available at peak rises to about 10-12%.
17.       In terms of energy supplied to the Northern region grid from the
project, the Singrauli share of forecast unconstrained energy requirement
will be about 13% in 1988/89. In 1983/84, its share in the consumption
actually met is anticipated to be 5-6%.

SECOND SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Suggested Terms of Reference for a Study to Prepare
a Least-Cost Power Development Program
Introduction
1.        With the rapid growth of the power sector, the increasing size of
power plants and the resultant complexity of operation, it has become neces-
sary to extend the perspective of power development both geographically and
with regard to the considered period, in order to avoid possible unjustified
investments in the future and the occurrence of chronic gaps between demand
and supply.
2.        These Terms of Reference outline the scope of a study to be under-
taken by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) (with possible technical
advisory services if consicdered necessary), aimed at preparing a least-cost
power development strategy for the country for the next twenty years, initi-
ally for the period 1980-2000. The study should be updated periodically
(say, every two years) to reflect the current trends in the country's economic
development. It would thus become a basis for investment decisions for each
five year plan and within the context of a long-range least-cost national
program. The study should include, inter alia, detailed demand forecasts.
investigations of power generation schemes to meet load growth requirements
efficiently, development o:. primary grid configurations, coordination of the
power sector with plans for other sectors, resources requirements, and recom-
mendations on responsibilities and operational policies at the state, regional
and national levels.
Existing Facilities
3.        The study should review the existing power facilities in the country
and those under construction, by state and region, including a general descrip-
tion of the supply stations, power and energy capabilities, equipment types,
transmission line voltages and configuration, power system characteristics
such as load flow, short circuit and stability considerations, and facility
retirement schedules. A survey should be made of the present capacities of
the generating, transmission and distribution systems in each state/region,
as a basis of determining future system expansion requirements. This should
include a critical analysis of the availability and capacity utilization of
thermal power plants in the public sector with possible targets for improving
the situation, and necessary measures to reach these targets. The types and
sizes of generating capacities in the private sector should be included so
that data are available on the overall power sector.

ANNEX 8
Page 2 of 5 pages
Existing Power Market
4.        The historic power market should be reviewed by state/region,
covering at least ten years, i.e., 1970-80, divided into the various consumer
categories with special emphasis on large industrial loads. System energy
losses should be reviewed by state/region, and losses should be broken down
in those attributable to station auxiliaries, transmission losses, distri-
bution losses, unpaid electricity, etc. The pattern and trend of monthly
peak (kW) and energy (kWh) demands should be studied and any unsatisfied
demand, peak and/or energy, should be estimated.
Load Forecast
5.        Load forecasts should be made, building on the framework of the
"Annual Power Surveys" for the period 1980-2000, including, if necessary,
monthly forecasts in regions where hydro energy availability in critical
water years may influence the development program. Appropriate methodology
should be used, including extrapolation of statistical data, regression
modeling using the relationship between electricity consumption and appro-
priate independent variables such as gross domestic product, analysis of
urbanization and electrification trends, projected population growth, satu-
ration of present market, consideration of the sales impact of expected
future tariffs, review of trends in reduction of losses and unpaid consump-
tion, and a survey of expected major industrial consumers and other economic
development plans with consideration of possible delays in implementation
schedules. The forecast for each state/region should be developed on an
energy basis, thereafter determining peak demand based on the expected evolu-
tion of the system load factor. To allow for data uncertainties, a range of
forecasts should be developed (i.e., "high," "low," "most likely") and the
basis of each and its probability should be explained.
6.        The regional load forecasts should be combined into a national
forecast with appropriate consideration of any possible diversities between
regions.
Energy Resources
7.        The country's known energy resources--coal, oil, gas, hydro, nuclear
fuels should be reviewed giving all available data including location, size
of field and reserves, available energy and capacity in the case of hydro
sites, ownership, present production, national market, future production
schedules, refinery plans, economic costs, etc. An assessment should be
made of the alternative uses of these resources, e.g., in the case of natural
gas, use as feedstock for fertilizer or petrochemical production.
Least-Cost Regional Programs
8.        Taking account of possible interconnections between states and
regions (see para 14), all practicable alternatives should be considered
in the preparation of regional least-cost development programs, comprising
the most beneficial combination of thermal, hydro and nuclear power plants.

ANNEX 8
Page 3 of 5 pages
9.        The capital costs should be based on present (1979 or 1980) prices,
excluding taxes, duties or interest during construction (which should be
shown separately) without escalation. The capital costs should be separated
into civil works, electromechanical works, engineering, administration (for
owners's costs associated with project execution) and physical contingencies.
All costs should be expressed in CIF/FOB prices or their equivalent. Capital
cost estimates should be prepared for the hydro sources that are known from
the results of the available studies and for thermal alternatives from recent
feasibility studies.
10.       Recurrent operation and maintenance costs (except fuel) should also
be based on present prices, without allowance for future inflation. The fuel
requirements of the alternatives considered should be valued at their oppor-
tunity cost, e.g., coal at its incremental cost of production; crude oil. at
import or possible export price; residual fuel oil at the import price (or
export price, if to be supplied from local refineries), and natural gas at its
economic value if not used for electricity production.
I1.       Other shadow prices should be used wherever appropriate in costing
the alternatives (e.g., for valuing unskilled labor).
12.       least-cost development programs should be prepared for each region
based on a common reliability standard say, a capacity reserve from a loss
of load probability analysis (LOLP) using the discounted cash flow method to
compare alternative programs for the period 1980-2000. The comparison of
the alternative programs should include all relevant transmission costs where
these may change with alternative programs.
13.       The discounted cash flow comparison should be based on a 10%
opportunity cost of capital with sensitivity testing in the range of 8 to 13%.
Sinking fund residual values, if any, of the capital costs at the end of the
discount period should be deducted. Changes in plant scheduling and possible
changes in plant mixes through adoption of the "high" or "low" load forecasts
should be expected. Sensitivity testing should also be conducted for changes,
over the range of possible values, in capital costs, and operating and main-
tenance costs.
Regional Interconnections
14.       It is expected that within the 1980-2000 study period, interconnec-
tion of most, if not all, of the state/regional systems may become feasible.
The regional programs should, therefore, be restudied assuming various inter-
connections to consider the benefit obtained through reduction of generating
capacity reserves, complementary operation of hydro and thermal sources,
increased energy capability if some hydraulic diversity exists, more rapid
absorption of major new sources, increased availability and utilization of
existing capacities, etc. For this purpose the relative merits of different
transmission voltages should be compared to determine the most economic
choice of the next voltage level, including DC back to back ties, given the
expected long-term development of the national power system.

ANNEX 8
Page 4 of 5 pages
Organization of the Power Sector
15.       The study should examine the present organization of the Power
Sector, with the State Electricity Boards as principal agencies and the
recently created national corporations, NTPC and NHPC, which are responsible
for the construction and operation of large power plants. Recommendations
should be made with regard to the long-term measures to be taken by the
Government in the organization of the sector to reflect the structural
changes in the power systems, from state level to region level and finally
to an interconnected national grid.
Constraints
16.       Of major consideration in the study would be the financing of
growth in the electricity industry. The rate at which electricity consump-
tion has been growing relative to GNP is much higher in India than is typical
in other countries, being about 2:1 as against 1:1 respectively. The ability
to mobilize resources to finance continued growth at this level is likely to
be a restricting factor to the development of the physical program. Another
factor which in the past has curtailed physical achievements is inflation.
The study would need to review financial planning methodology currently used
by GOI in investment planning to recognize the existence of inflation. (Con-
sidering the relatively long gestation periods of generation projects, resources
which have been earmarked for the physical program have to be diverted to
finance inflation of earlier projects unless additional resources can be
mobilized.
17.       Other points of reference would be:
(a) Sources of resource mobilization. There is need to increase
the internal resources generated by the SEBs so as to relieve
the burden of financing of the power sector from general
revenue sources.
(b) Need for efficiency in operations of SEBs--improved organi-
zational structure and management, and more efficient use
of existing plants.
Study Results
18.       The study results should show the least-cost national program,
region by region, and combination of regions where interconnection is
recommended within the period 1980-2000, based on a rational discount rate
and the "most likely" load forecast. A full explanation of the impact of
the various sensitivity tests should be given, including related recommenda-
tions in cases where substantial savings or increases in reliability could
be made by small changes in the base assumptions.
19.       The schedule of projects and their costs comprising the least-cost
program for the period 1980-2000, together with the year-by-year investments
(at least until 1995), should be shown for each region and combined into a

Page 5 of 5 pages
national total (including estimates for the private sector), with appropriate
regional investments for transmission and distribution, to provide the overall
power sector investment requirements.
20.       The study results should include proposals for the organization of
the Power Sector, the phases of its implementation and for increasing of
sector efficiency.
21.       The results should be compared to the investment program presently
planned or under construction for the initial part of the study period. The
"ideal" schedule of projects as resulting from the study should be reviewed
in the light of projects under implementation that might not be fully con-
sistent with the study results. Similarly, "second-best" scenarios should
be prepared taking into account the resource constraints.

SECOND SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Financial Position of the State Electricity Boards
1.        The problems associated with the SEBs' financial position have been
the subject of continuing dialogue with GOI. Under previous transmission
Credits/Loan, the beneficiary SEBs undertook to achieve and maintain rates of
return of 9-1/2% (on a rate base stated at actual cost), in some cases on a
graduated basis, in order to take account of particular circumtances. (See
Attachment 1). In all cases the 9-1/2% rate was to be achieved by FY1979.
Results have been moderately successful, with a wide variation in performance
as between SEBs. By FY1977, seven out of the sixteen major SEBs achieved
their target rates of return, with a further two SEBs reaching their targets
in FY1978 with the help of rural electrification subsidies from their State
Governments under the conditions of eligibility for the second rural electri-
fication project (Credit 911-IN). Uttar Pradesh SEB is expected to reach
9-1/2% in FY1979 mainly due to State Government rural electrification subsi-
dization commencing in that year, again under eligibility criteria of Credit
911-IN. The other six SEBs, while not reaching the stipulated return, showed
improving trends up through FY1977. However, the results generally deterio-
rated during FYs1978 and 1979 to leave seven out of the sixteen major SEBs
in a position of default on their rate of return undertakings with the
Association. This group included two Northern Region SEBs, Haryana and
Rajasthan, and the DESU (recipients of Singrauli power).
2.        The main reason for the poor financial performance of some of the
SEBs was that tariffs have not kept pace with increases in operating costs
thus not ensuring that a healthy ratio between operating income and capital
base is maintained during periods of expansion. Other factors which have
adversely affected financial performance were: low availability of plant and
of power imports from neighboring state systems, and increased cost of these
imports because of a higher proportion of expensive thermal power where pre-
viously cheaper hydro power was available. It can be justifiably argued that
the situation faced by some SEBs did not constitute "normal circumatances"
and that the achievement of covenanted rates of return could not be realistic-
ally expected.
3.        During appraisal, financial plans for the restoration of rates of
return to at least 9-1/2% were discussed with the SEBs and the DESU of the
Northern Region and found acceptable. These plans either have been imple-
mented or are under implementation and consist of: tariff increases ranging
from 10-14%, rationalization of manpower requirements, improving generating
efficiency, reduction in line losses, improved billing and collection proce-
dures, and introduction of other cost reduction measures. In the case of
Haryana, plans include the commencement of subsidization of rural electrifi-
cation losses by the State Government.

Page 2 of 2 pages
4.        The financial provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948,
have been recently amended to put the operations of the SEBs on a more com-
mercial basis by enabling them to generate internally a reasonahie (considered
by CEA to be 20-25%) contribution to their capital investments. Under the
Amendments (Section 59 (1)), the State Governments are now required to specify
the level of annual surplus which should be earned by their SEBs to enable
them to comply with the amended legislation. The manner in which this will
be achieved is a subject which has been under evaluation by both the State
Governments in conjunction with their SEBs, and by the finance panel of the
Rajadhyaksha Committee. Complex issues are involved which will require
"tailoring" by each State Government to meet the particular circumtances of
its SEB, while at the same time giving due consideration to State resources
and impact on consumers. CEA has issued guidelines to the State Governments
and the SEBs explaining these issues and pointing out the measures that need
to be taken by each of them and the options which are available.
5.        The guidelines emphasize the following aspects:
(i)  special steps to increase sales volume;
(ii)  economies in both operating costs and capital
expenditure;
(iii) more efficient asset utilization;
(iv)  timely commissioning of new projects;
(v)  reduction in line losses;
(vi)  improved financial management;
(vii) tariff revisions to reflect cost of supply;
(viii)  capital structure adjustemnts - SEBs may now receive
funds from the State Government in the form of share
capital, and State Government loans may now be con-
verted into share capital;
(ix)  disposal of arrears of State Government loan
interest; and
(x)  basis for charging depreciation of fixed assets.
6.        Because of the far reaching consequences of the above measures, the
State Governments and their SEBs are awaiting the findings of the Rajadhyaksha
Committee before implementing financial policies to give effect to the finan-
cial amendments of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948.

INDIA
SECOND SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Description of the Singrauli Development
1.        The Singrauli development is the first of a series of large thermal
power stations, planned by the Government of India, to feed into a 400 kV
interconnected transmission system and supply bulk power to the State Elec-
tricity Boards (SEBs). The Singrauli 2,000 MW power station is being installed
on the fringe of the Rihand Reservoir adjacent to the extensive Singrauli coal
fields at Shaktinagar in the Mirzapur District of Uttar Pradesh.
2.        The plant will consist of 5 x 200 MW and 2 x 500 MW generating units
with boiler plant, ancillary electrical and mechanical equipment and associated
400 kV transmission. First Singrauli Project (Credit 685-IN) consisted of
the 3 x 200 MW first stage installation. The Second Singrauli Project will
consist of the second stage installation of 2 x 200 MW units and 2 x 500 MW
units.
3.        The 200 MW turbines are three cylinders, tandem compound 3,000 rpm,
double flow exhaust type reheat units, operating at 130 kg/cm with a steam
temperature of 535 C. The generators will be of the hydrogen cooled type,
and will each be rated at 235,000 kVA. The boilers are natural circulation,
pulverized fuel fired, balanced draft type using the direct firing system.
Each boiler will have a continuous evapoiation rating of 700 t/h with a
superheater outlet pressure of 138 kg/cm and temperature of 535 C. Each
200 MW generating unit will be connected to a 250 MVA transformer and will
feed power into the 400 kV system.
4.        The 500 MW turbines will be three cyclinders reheat condensing type
having one HP cyclinder, one double flow IP cyclinder and one double flow LP
cyclinder with initial steam parameters of 168 kg/cm and 538 C/538 C.  The
generators will be water and hydrogen cooled type with each rated at 588 MVA.
The boiler will be a controlled circulation, pulverized fuel fired, balanced
draft type, using the direct firing system.  It will have a continuous eva- 2
poratiog rating of 1,700 t/h with a superheater outlet pressure of 178 kg/cm
and 540 C. It is proposed that each generating unit will have four single
phase 200 MVA, 21/400 kV transformers and will feed power into the 400 kV
system.
5.        The salient features of the development are shown below:

ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 3 pages
POWER STATION
Capacity  -    2,000 MW (5 x 200 MW + 2 x 500 MW).
Fuel      -    Coal from the Singrauli coal fields located within
6 km of the project. Consumption of the 2,000 MW
power station at 5,500 hours operation per year is
6.49 million t/year. The calorific value of the
coal averages 4,000 kcal/kg, it has an ash content
of 30-40% and a moisture content of 10-12% at 60%
relative humidity and 400C.
Transport      Unit train continuous system with continuous bottom
of Coal -    discharging wagons.
Cooling        The cooling water system for the Singrauli power
System  -    station envisages the use of the Rihand reservoir
as cooling pond. The cooling water requirement for
ultimate capacity of 2,000 MW would be drawn fr om
this reservoir. Out of the total drawal of 84m
(3,000 ft)/sec most of the water would be returned
to the reservoir, the consumptive water requirements
for boiler make up and township being comparatively
small. A pumphouse is being constructed on the
bank of the reservoir with an approach channel
extending to the minimum drawdown level 254 m
(830 ft). This will be expanded to meet the second
stage requirements. From the pumphouse, the water
will be pumped to the power house through the intake
duct. The hot water will be taken from the power
house via a discharge duct to a number of points
on the shore of the reservoir on the opposite
side of the power house.
Ash             Ash is pumped as a slurry through a pipe to the
Disposal -   ash disposal area of about 800 ha (2,000 acres),
situated some 5 km from the power station. The
area is reclaimed from the Rihand Reservoir and
is contained within an earth bund 12 km long.
Land      -    A total area of approximately 1,200 ha (3,000
acres) including about 160 ha (390 acres) for
power station, switchyard, coal storage, etc.,
and 240 ha (600 acres) for the residential colony
is being acquired. About 16 ha (40 acres) is
required for main approach road and ash slurry
line and the balance is largely unusable area.

Page 3 of 4 pages
(g) Tariffs
NTPC has an obligation to achieve a rate of return of not less
than 9-1/2% on the forecast average net fixed assets in service
by FY1989, and from the commencement of its commercial operations
in FY1982 to set tariffs at levels not lower than those required
to achieve a 9-1/2% rate of return on the forecast data for
FY1989. On this basis, and bearing in mind the time it takes
for the generating plant to reach an operating level of 5,500
hours a year, the average price of 27.22 paise/kWh calculated
on the FY1989 estimates, is assumed as the average price for all
sales from February 1982.
(h) Fuel
Fuel costs are based on the prices per ton shown in paragraph
2(c) and escalated at 5% per annum until FY1982. Thereafter a
fuel clause is assumed in the bulk supply contract, to permit
adjustment to meet any further variation in fuel costs. The
effect of any fuel price variation is shown separately in the
forecast expenses and recovered by means of a fuel surcharge.
(i) Rate Base
Construction costs are based on 1978 prices escalated at 6%
per annum except where orders have been placed when escalation
at 6% per annum is applied from award date. Turbine generators
and boilers are subject to the following maximum price escala-
tion from the date of order:
Singrauli 200 MW units                         -  25%
Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka 200 MW units  -  20%
All 500 MW units                               -  15% Generators
- 20% Boilers
Physical contingencies have been assumed as follows:
Civil Works                                    -  10%
Plant & Equipment                              -   5%
The average rate base is half the sum of the net fixed assets
in service at the beginning and end of the year.
(j) Capital Requirements
(a) The proposed Credit would be relent by the GOI to NTPC
for a period of 20 years from the date of withdrawal
of the first installment including a 5 year initial
grace period, and repayable in equal semiannual install-
ments of principal, together with interest at the rate
of 10-1/4% per annum on unpaid balances.



- 86 -
ANNEX 20
Page 4 of 4 pages
(ii) Other capital requirements would be advanced by GOI in the
form of debt and fully paid up equity capital, provided
that the unpaid debt at the end of each year would not
exceed the sum of the issued share capital and the "free"
reserves, that is to say those which are not required
for specific purposes.
(iii) GOI loans (including the onlending of both the proposed
Credit and also previously approved Credits and Loan) are
assumed to finance either defined projects or individual
generating units and transmission lines included in NTPC's
investment program. Interest on the loans up to the date
of commissioning of each unit of plant would be charged
to construction, and subsequent interest accruals would
be charged to revenue. Repayment of principal is assumed
in 30 semiannual installments commencing on the first
anniversary following the end of the five year grace
period.
(k)  Working Capital
Variations in working capital represent the differences between
the sums of the inidividual items making up current assets less
current liabilities at the beginning and at the end of the year.
(1)  Balance Sheets (Annex 19)
Current Assets
(i) Receivables are assumed at a level equivalent to one-
twelfth of the revenue for the year; and
(ii) Inventories are assumed at 1% of gross assets at the
end of the year.
Current Liabilities
Current liabilities are assumed at a level of one month's
fuel cost, plus 4% of the annual operating and maintenance
expenses.

SECOND SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
NTPC's Bulk Tariff (Northern Region) and Bulk Exchange Tariffs
in Northern Region
1.        The proposed regional financial bulk tariff of about 23 paise/kWh for
supply from Singrauli to the Northern Region needs to be seen in the general
context of "bulk" tariffs and costs prevailing in the region. Tariffs charged
between supply authorities for energy exchanges in 1978/79 were as follows:
Paise/kWh
UPSEB purchase from NTPC (Badarpur)                     23
UPSEB purchase from Himachal Pradesh                     18
UPSEB net exchange with MPSEB                          16-17
HSEB purchase from NTPC (Badarpur)                      22
HSEB purchase from Punjab                               22
RSEB purchase from RAPS (nuclear)                      13-22
2.        These exchange tariffs at voltages similar to those of the proposed
Singrauli sale points, have only a general relationship with costs of genera-
tion, in that the relatively lower price of energy obtained from HPSEB is
attributable to the lower cost at hydro stations in Himachal Pradesh compared
to Badarpur. In theory, an elaborate system of guidelines exists in the
Northern Region, defining the method of calculating cost-related tariffs for
such instances as short-term supply, banking transactions, night valley
supply, spinning reserve, emergency assistance, and inadvertent exchanges.
In practice, the exchange tariff levels are arrived at after reaching a com-
promise on opposing views. This is illustrated in the case of Rajasthan,
where the cost-related 19-22 paise/kWh that were to be charged by the nuclear
supply authority were held at 13 paise because no agreement could be reached
with RSEB.
3.        It should be borne in mind that the present range of exchange tariffs,
if regularly adjusted for general inflation, could reach 19-27 paise/kWh by
1982, when the first Singrauli energy would be supplied and a level of 27-38
paise/kWh by the late 1980s. At that time the Singrauli tariff is still
projected to be at 23 paise, thus possibly falling behind the general regional
exchange tariff level.
4.        The cost of energy supply by SEBs at high voltage levels in the
Region can be estimated by using the following samples of average financial 1/
costs:
1/   Financial cost is defined as the SEB's accounting cost.

RSEB                        10

/a  Includes purchased energy cost.  Source:  SEBs.
5.        Again assuming adjustment for inflation, the average regional SEB
cost of supply at voltage levels comparable to NTPC's will be 25 paise/kWh in
1982, and will rise to about 36 paise/kWh by 1989. While NTPC power is likely
to be about equally costly in 1982 as the regional average generating cost, it
will have a competitive advantage by 1989, if the Singrauli tariff will remain
fixed. For SEBs such as Haryana or Rajasthan, however (or any SEB relying on
hydro power to a large extent), NTPC power will represent a costly purchase
on average. UPSEB and DESU will benefit most from NTPC's present intentions
with respect to tariff levels. On a marginal basis, incremental energy obtained
from NTPC is likely to be the least-cost source of power in the region in the
long run.

SECOND SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Regional Marginal Cost Analysis of NTPC Operations
1.        The following assumptions are necessary to make marginal cost
analysis for NTPC a relevant exercise that can enter as input into tariff
considerations:
(a) Each station is reviewed as an independent system selling
power in bulk to the Region concerned;
(b) Whether there will be additional investment by NTPC in each
Region or not beyond the presently planned program, NTPC at
each of its regional stations will ultimately operate at its
capacity limit: this implies that any incremental demand
will have to be satisfied by further investment, and justi-
fies the inclusion of representative marginal capacity cost
in the tariff;
(c) All sales of energy will be at the level of 400 kV;
(d) There will be no seasonal and only minor daily variation in
NTPC's load demand: all stations will be operated as base
load for the participating SEBs, thus eliminating any peaks
in NTPC operations; and
(e) For each station, the program of commissioning of units and
annual hours of operation is taken as planned by NTPC.
2.        The method used for the computation of an approximation of long-run
marginal cost is the concept of Average Incremental Cost (AIC), smoothing out
any fluctuations by averaging over the entire known investment program. The
results are expressed in terms of both (a) a uniform energy charge per Region,
incorporating both marginal capacity and energy costs; and (b) a two-part
tariff consisting of a capacity charge and an energy charge, recovering
marginal capacity and energy costs, respectively.
3.        The basic computation is performed in terms of constant 1979 costs.
In order to arrive at marginal cost in future years when energy will be sold
to SEBs, it is assumed (in the absence of a longer-term investment plan) that
any investment necessary to satisfy incremental demand beyond NTPC capacity
at the time will have the same pattern as the investment envisaged for the
late 1970's and 1980's. For this purpose, marginal cost for future years is
arrived at by updating the 1979 marginal cost by projected inflation rates of
from 10% p.a. declining to 5% p.a. in 1984. All marginal costs are expressed
in constant market prices of the year in question, and discounted at 10% p,a.

INDIA
SECOND SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Additional Transmission and Distribution Cost
1.        The Draft Plan 1978-83 (Annex 9) provides for about 60% of the
regional expenditure to be allocated to generation, the rest to transmission,
distribution and rural electrification (i.e. rural distribution). Non-
generation expenditure, therefore, accounts for about 67% of generation
expenditure.
2.        The cost of the project already includes a transmission element
which accounts for about one third of the generating plant component. The
difference between this and the regional average is, therefore, allocated to
the project to enable a comparison with tariff revenue at retail level: an
additional investment necessary to serve final consumers.
3.        Operating and maintenance expenditure on the additional transmis-
sion and distribution facilities is assumed to be 2% of the cumulative value
of the assets installed.
4.        The split by cost components of the additional investment is
assumed to be similar to that of the original transmission component included
in the project, and is expressed in identical economic terms.
5.        The amount of energy sold to final consumers is arrived at by
reducing the kWh sent out from the project after auxiliary use by the average
regional system losses:
Share of Regional
State        Consumption (%)        System Losses (%)
Haryana                  12                    21.5
Himachal Pradesh          1                    25.9
Jammu & Kashmir           2                    23.8
Punjab                   21                    17.5
Rajasthan                13                    24.5

INDIA
SECOND SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Shadow Pricing of Costs and Benefits
1.        Conversion Factors.  Where CIF or FOB prices of tradeable goods
(or tradeable inputs into only domestically manufactured goods) are not
readily available, the following factors are used to convert non-traded
goods' domestic costs to border prices:
Standard conversion factor              0.87
Capital goods conversion factor         0.78
Local materials conversion factor       0.87
2.        Shadow Wage Rate.  Before converting labor cost to border prices,
using the standard conversion factor, the following assumptions about the
economic value of labor are made:
Skilled labor                  100% of market wage
Unskilled labor                 75% of market wage
Furthermore, about 60% of the total labor cost of the project in terms of
1979 market prices are assumed to be attributable to skilled labor.
3.        Aluminum Component of Transmission.  The domestic aluminum price
being subsidized, it is necessary to use the higher CIF price to establish
economic cost at a time of import necessity. The aluminum content of the
domestic ex-works cost of conductor (excluding the labor content) is about
50%. A CIF price of $1,800/ton is applied to this cost element, increasing
it by about 20%.
4.        Economic Cost of Coal.  Rather than using the domestic administered
price of coal, its economic value is expressed by identifying the average pro-
duction cost as follows:

Total               88.64            86.19
5.        Labor cost is assumed to consist of 50% skilled and 50% unskilled
labor; stores to consist of capital goods and local materials; capital goods
costs are converted to border prices at the capital goods conversion factor,
other expenditure at the standard conversion factor. The economic cost of
coal amounts to Rs 68-70/t. An average of Rs 69/t is used.
6.        For the alternative to the project, the following cost of coal is
assumed, reflecting transport from the closest location:
Financial Cost       of which         Economic
Stations            (Rs/t)        Freight (Rs/t)    Cost (Rs/t)

Punjab & Haryana       153                92                149
7.        Opportunity Cost of Capital.  A range between 10 and 13% is assumed
to reflect the rate of return on public investment in the economy.
8.        Benefits.  The alternative use of expenditure for tariff payments
and maintaining standby generating sets is assumed to be expenditure on a
basket of tradeable goods. Consequently, the standard conversion factor
is used to convert these benefit proxies to border prices.

SECOND SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Economic Benefits
1.        The approach used is one of identifying a proxy for the minimum
benefit that reflects the willingness of consumers to pay for incremental
power supply. The traditional method is to use tariff revenue for this pur-
pose, bearing in mind that actual, non-quantified, benefits are considerably
higher, both because of the existence of a consumers' surplus, and because
of the non-market, subsidized level of power tariffs. Some of this surplus
is identifiable if the cost incurred by industrial consumers for the purchase
and operation of diesel standby generating sets is included in the benefits
instead of the industrial tariff revenue only. A further refinement would
be to express benefits in terms of industrial and agricultural output gained
by the project's alleviation of power outages that interrupt production.
Additional benefits such as greater work, leisure, and educational benefits
accruing to domestic consumers are quantifiable only with difficulty.
Tariff Revenue
2.        The minimum proxy for benefits in the Region is arrived at as
follows:
Share of Regional   Average Tariff 1979
State                    Consumption (%)          (paise/kWh)
Haryana                             12                      26.0
Himachal Pradesh                     1                     21.0
Jammu & Kashmir                      2                     20.0
Punjab                              21                     20.3
Rajasthan                           13                     24.3
Uttar Pradesh                       41                      30.0
Delhi                               10                     30.0
Weighted average (financial)                               26.4
Weighted average (economic)                                23.0
Cost of Standby Generation
3.        The following samples were used to establish the capital cost of
recently purchased standby diesel sets:

ANNEX 28

Unit Size (kW)      Cost of Set (Rs 1978)    Rs/kW
244                 284,000              2,869
200                 600,000              3,000
315               1,000,000              3,174
244                 700,000              2,869
Assuming an average 1979 purchase price of about Rs 3,000/kW, plus 10%
installation charges, the total cost of Rs 3,300/kW can be expressed per kWh
as follows, assuming that an industrial consuemr satisfies his demand by using
own generation:
Life of set: 15 years
Average utilization: 4,400 hours/year
(50% load factor)
Annual charge at 13% discount rate   :    Rs 510/kW/year
or   Rs 0.12/kWh
Annual O&M cost @ Rs 180/kW/year        :    Rs 0.04/kWh
Annual fuel and lubricant cost at
0.25 l/kWh @ Rs 1.50/1               :    Rs 0.38/kWh
Total cost (financial)                  :    Rs 0.54/kWh
Total cost (border prices)  about    :    Rs 0.52/kWh
4.        The economic cost of Rs 0.52/kWh (at the assumed load factor) rep-
resents the observed maximum willingness to pay for continuous power supply.
Combined with the average industrial tariff in the region of 25 paise/kWh
(Haryana: 29, Punjab: 22, Rajasthan: 24, Uttar Pradesh: 25) and its economic
equivalent of 22 paise/kWh, the resulting average benefit proxy for industrial
consumers is 37 paise/kWh in economic terms. 1/ It can be confidently assumed
that this represents the demonstrated willingness to pay.
1/   Assuming a sloping demand curve for industrial energy inputs.  A mix
between grid supply and own generation can be imagined between the two
extremes, resulting in decreasing average valuation of the kWh unit with
decreasing utilization of the standby set: a movement along the demand
curve. In aggregate terms, the average willingness to pay is assumed to
be halfway between cost of own generation and the tariff.
