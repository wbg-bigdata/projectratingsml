MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FOR THE IRRIGATION IV PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Senegal for SDR 26.2 million (US$33.6 million) is
submitted for approval.  The  proposed credit would be  on standard IDA  terms
with a 40 years maturity, and help finance the modernization of irrigated
perimeters anu the strengthening of agricultural support services in the
Senegal river Delta. The Project would be cofinanced by KfW for SDR 7.8
million (US$10 million equivalent), BADEA for SDR 3.7 million (US$4.7 million
equivalent), CCCE for SDR 8.3 million (US$10.6 million equivalent), and the
Ministry of Cooperation of France for SDR 1.0 million (US$1.3 million
equivalent).
2.      Background.  Senegal's  irrigation  potential  is being  dramatically
increased by the construction of the Diama and Manantali dams on the Senegal
River. These two dams will permit double-cropping irrigation on 375,000 ha,
of which over 240,000 ha in Senegalese territory. The currently-irrigated
area, by contrast, is only 33,000 ha, of which 20,000 ha in large perimeters,
farmed by smallholders and one enclave sugar estate in the Delta where the
proposed project would be located, and 13,000 ha in small, village perimeters
upstream. Until now, Goverrment's principal instrument for the development of
irrigation in the Senegal Valley has been SAED, which was established in 1965
to plan, execute and manage irrigated farming.   Performance has been mixed;
the pace of development of new perimeters has been slow, and maintenance of
existing perimeters has been inadequate, yet crop yields have been good,
measured against irrigation world standards.   Throughout the 1970s, the main
reason for this poor performance was government's intervention in cereals
pricing and irrigation financing. The producer price of paddy was set below
the import price and, in order to keep farm incomes at a satisfactory level,
the charges levied on farmers for inputs and services provided by SAED were
set below cost. So long as Government was able to provide an offsetting
subsidy to SAED, this  system worked - although  it provided no incentive  for
SAED to improve efficiency, nor did it create a competitive environment in
which other, private suppliers of services could participate. This system
broke down when  Government budgetary constraints  became more severe;  SAED's
finances were disrupted and operations deteriorated.
3.      Starting in 1981, the Government decided,  with the help of the  donor
community, to undertake a lcng-term program to improve the performance of the
existing irrigated perimeters and pave the way for more diversified, and
hopefully more rapid irrigation development .in the Senegal river region.
Steps already taken have included raising official producer prices up to and
then above import prices, and increasing consumer prices well above import
prices, decentralizing management of SAED's perimeters, rice mills and civil
works   to    regional   offices    along    the   valley,    and    providing



-2-
management  training  and  literacy   programs  for  newly-promoted   farmers'
organizations.
4.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The  proposed project is in line  with
the agricultural sector r?forms set out by the Government in its 1984 New
Agricultural Policy (NIE, and reflected in SAED's present agreement (Lettre
de Mission) with the Government and in the Structural Adjustment program (Cr.
1802-SE). The Project also provides continuity to the Irrigation Technical
Assistance Project (Cr. 1632-SE) by implementing the recommendations of its
studies. Financing by IDA is justified by: (i) its participation in the
efficient and sustainable irrigation development of the huge potential created
by the availability of water from the Manantali and Diama dams; and (ii) its
role as lead agency for the institutional and policy reforms in the irrigation
sector, in  cooperation  with  the  Government.   Furthermore,  without  IDA's
involvement, the necessary co-financing of the Project could not have been
mobilized.
5.      Proiect Objectives.  The broad objective of the Project is to pave the
way for  sustainable  irrigation  development  in  the  Senegal  valley.   The
specific objectives are: (i) to improve the performance and maintenance of
existirg perimeters designed for smallholder farming; (ii) to reduce the scope
of SAED's activities, partly to reduce SAED's costs, but even more importantly
to enable ?otential private suppliers of such activities to enter the market;
(iii) to explore the scope for diversifying cropping patterns and forms of
irrigated farming; and (iv) to strengthen SAED's planning and managerial
capacities.
6.      Prolect Description.  Within the policy  framework set by the  ongoing
structural  adjustment  program,  the   proposed  project  would  attain   its
objectives   through   institutional   and   agricultural   components.    The
institutional component  would include:  (i) disengagement  by SAED  from  its
production-related activities - and corresponding staff reductions - in favor
of increased concentration on its public service functions, which will entail
some  staff   strengthening;  and   (ii)  development   within  the   National
Agricultural Credit Bank (CNCAS) of a credit structure to serve farmers and
private contractors in  the Senegal river  Delta.  The agricultural  component
would include modernization and expansion of three perimeters (7,000 ha),
improved perimeter maintenance, improved extension and training, applied
research, reforestation, and water-borne disease control.
7.      The total cost of the Project  is estimated at US$65.6 million with  a
foreign exchange component of US$29.7 million (45Z). A breakdown of costs and
the  financing  plan  are  shown  in  Schedule  A.   Amounts  and methods  of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank group
operations in Senegal are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6484-SE, dated September 3, 1987
is also attached.
8.      Agreed Actions.  The main condition  of effectiveness of the  proposed
project is that the third *Lettre de mission' setting out the respective
obligations of the Government and SAED has been signed by the two



-3-
parties. The principal actions on which agreement has been reached with the
Government are that: (i) the Government would publish an investment guide,
consistent with the principles of the Government's Letter of Development
Policy dated April 16, 1987, and would ensure that SAED only undertakes
irrigation projects which are technically, economically and financially
justified, and would review periodically its investment program with IDA;
(ii) SAED would  implement the  disengagement program contained  in the  third
'Lettre de mission'; (iii) SAED would implement the staff reduction plan
contained in the third 'Lettre de mission"; and (iv) SAED would charge farmers
the operation and maintenance costs of water as soon as double-cropping is
feasible.
9.      Justification.  The Project would result in the improved operation and
maintenance of some 7,000 ha of irrigation schemes in the Senegal river Delta
thereby making possible sustained and increased production primarily of rice,
but also of tomatoes, maize, and sorghum   The economic rate of return is IOZ.
In addition, the project's institutional reform program would have major
non-quantifiable benefits. SAED's disengagement from its production-related
activities would result in attracting new farmers, agro-businesses, and
support services into the area. In addition, the strengthening of SAED's
service activities would lead to more effective training of farmers in
agricultural methods, water use. mechanical repairs and management and
better-formulated projects. The creation of an agricultural credit network in
the area would allow farmers and their associations to buy inputs from private
distributors, have their land prepared by private contractors and their
equipment repaired by private mechanics. As SAED disengages, and goods and
services tegin to be traded on a commercial basis, the business climate for
the development of the valley would be greatly improved.
10.     Risks.  Possible risks woulc be: (a) a slower-than-expected transition
to double-cropping; (b) inadequate maintenance; (c) failure of the credit
network, since the history of credit in Senegal shows that a habit of
delinquency exists which, if not overcome, could hamper its operations, thus
retarding SAED's disengagement; (d) failure of Government to maintain a price
policy adequate to sustair- agricultural production; and (e) slowness of the
private sector to take over production-related activities relinquished by
SAED.  Protection against those  risks has been provided  for in the  proposed
project: (a) the reinforcement of SAED's training and extension services would
provide farmers with adequate technical skills for double-cropping; (b) it
would be the responsibility of SAED's Water Management Department to set up
maintenance programs and to see to it that they are executed; (c) SAED's
training expertise, technical advice and experience with farmers would provide
strong support to CNCAS's credit network; (d) IDA will maintain a constant
policy dialogue with the Government through the preparation and supervision of
structural  adjustment  programs   and  'lettres  de   mission";  and  (e)   a
diversification and marketing study would be undertaken, expressly to promote
private investment in the Senegal valley.

10.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would  comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
