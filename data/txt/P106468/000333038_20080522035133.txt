Implementing  The Ministryo f Planning and Finance.
Agency
Amount        SDR 3.7 million (US$6 million equivalent).

Terms         Grant.

Tranching     The operation will be disbursed in one single tranche, released upon Board approval in
              June 2008.

Development   The proposed Public and Natural Resource Management Development (PNRMD)
Objectivesand operation is designed to help implement the Government's economic reform program
Description   for 2008-2009 that is based on Silo Tom6 and Principe's Poverty Reduction Strategy
              Paper (PRSP). It supports policy measures aimed principally at improving the
              accountability, effectiveness and level o f public resources, and at strengthening
              governance inthe oil sector. It will inaddition support the authorities' efforts to initiate
              the preparation o f a new PRSP based on updated information on oil prospects and in
              depth analysis o f growth diversification options.

Benefits      The main policy actions being supported aim to improve the accountability and
              transparency o f public finances. Inparticular, the PNRMD operation is expected to: (i)
              strengthen budget preparation, execution, and control, including enhanced tax
              legislation and stronger impact o f public expenditures on poverty; and (ii)raise the
              standard o f petroleum governance in line with international standards o f transparency
              and competition as well as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).

Risks         Five main risks could influence the expected outcomes o f the proposed operation: (i)
              external factors such as increasing international oil prices or shortfalls indonor support
              could have a deterring impact on economic growth, reduce government resources and
              affect its ability to conduct its reform program - reserves accumulation and close
              cooperation with bilateral donors and the IMF reduce this risk; (ii)policy reversals or
              slippages in structural reforms, notably petroleum sector management, could affect the
              Government's ability to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment and focus
              expenditure on poverty reducing priorities identified in the PRSP - the prior actions
              assure early implementation o f key policies; (iii)weak human, institutional, and
              managerial capacity could slow down the pace o f implementation - this risk is being
              mitigated by concentrating reforms in a limited number o f sectors and heightened
              technical assistance; (iv) fiduciary risks with regard to the use o f public funds remain
              as internal and external control mechanisms remain weak - this risk i s mitigated by the
              wide scope o f public finance management reforms underway; and (v) reforms and the
              growth momentum may not be sustainable ifoil exploitation does not materialize - the
              authorities agree that additional policy adjustments would be needed in such a case.
              All these risks are mitigated by the strength o f the Government's ownership and
              commitment to implement the proposed measures, the Government's resolve to
              advance its reform agenda, in particular public finance management, by an active
              policy dialogue with Bank and Fund staff and the extension o f the Bank's Technical
              Assistance Capacity Building project and the assistance o f a Policy and Human
              Resources Development (PHRD) grant to prepare the operation. Various donors are
              providing technical assistance to improve capacity-building and ensure full
              implementation o f reforms.

                                     I. INTRODUCTION

1.       SPo Tomb and Principe(STP) is a small, poor Archipelago State. An archipelago o f
just over 1,000 square kilometers inthe Gulf o f Guinea, SBo Tom6 and Principe (STP) is one o f
the smallest economies in Africa with some 166,000 inhabitants and a gross national income
(GNI) per capita o f USS740. As o f 2001, 54 percent o f the population lived in poverty, and 15
percent lived in extreme poverty. Oil was discovered in 2006 in the waters STP shares with
Nigeria but effective exploitation, ifachievable, i s not expected until2014.

2.       The country is vulnerable, with little institutional capacity, yet committed to
macroeconomic stability and pro-poor growth. S5o Tom6 and Principe faces many
development challenges because o f its small size and vulnerability to terms o f trade and aid
dependency. Although a number o f social indicators have improved over the past years they
remain weak and progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) i s slow
and difficult to measure (Annex 6). To face these challenges, the authorities approved their
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in 2003 and have been firmly implementing it since
then. In addition, they have maintained a fair amount o f fiscal and monetary discipline in line
with objectives set in the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) 2006-2008.
These achievements have allowed the country to reach the Completion Point under the Enhanced
HIPC Initiative in March 2007 and to receive additional debt relief (topping-up and Multilateral
Debt ReliefInitiative, MDRI) inthe amount o f USS314million innominal terms.

3.       There are concernsabout fiscal sustainability if oil exploitation does not materialize.
Since 2005 the country has received USS77.8 million in oil bonuses from international oil
companies for oil exploration in the joint waters shared with Nigeria. Partial use o f these funds
has helped close the fiscal gap since 2005 but raised social expectations as reflected inthe almost
doubling o f the wage bill between 2002 and 2007. IMF and World Bank staff agree that in the
absence o f oil productionrevenues, there i s a highrisk o f debt and fiscal unsustainability once oil
bonuses run out. Furthermore, macroeconomic projections show that even if SBo Tom6 and
Principe produces oil, it will require substantial external assistance to bridge the interim period
until 2014 when oil exploitation might actually begin. Untiloil exploitation starts, Bank and the
IMF staff have advised the authorities to rein in current expenditures, notably the wage bill,
improve the business environment to raise economic growth and diversify the economy, and limit
the financing o f the current account deficit to grant or concessional support.

4.       This operation (totaling SDR 3.7 million or 3.8 percent of GDP) supports the
implementation of the PRSP in line with CAS objectives and helps consolidatethe results
achieved under the IMF-PRGF program. Building on the achievements and lessons o f
previous projects as well as the recently completed Public Expenditure Management and
Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR), the proposed operation will support CAS
implementation and the Government Action Plan in line with PRSP objectives. These include (i)
improving public expenditure efficiency through better budget preparation, execution, and control
in the context o f the implementation o f PEMFAR recommendations, strengthening tax
legislation, and assuring stronger impact o f public expenditures on poverty; and (ii)    raising the



                                                   1

standard o f oil revenue management in line with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI).This Government Action Planis alignedaroundthe PRSP pillars (see paragraph 35).

5.       This operation also strengthens institutional capacity to benefit potential oil
production and promotes coordination with other donors. Oil-abundant economies tend to
perform poorly inregard to long-term growth rates (when compared to non-oil economies). They
experience higher levels o f volatility o f output and revenues and, in spite o ftheir resource wealth,
a large number o f them are classified as severely indebted countries. Inaddition, there i s ample
evidence that oil-induced growth i s hardly pro-poor and that the arrival o f significant oil wealth
can undermine already weak institutions. The proposed operation will provide critical support and
financing necessary to facilitate the continuation o f the ongoing reform process, strengthen
institutional capacity on PRSP implementation and budget processes, and improve the policy
framework in the petroleum sector setting forth best international practices o f transparency and
accountability particularly in opening the Exclusive Economic Zone to oil exploration. The
operation will be implementedin close,collaboration with other donors, especially those involved
in Public Finance Management Reform (Portugal, France, European Union, Millennium
Challenge Corporation, UNDP and AfDB) to prepare the ground for eventual future joint budget
support operations.

                    A.        POLITICALCONTEXTINSA0 TOMEAND PRiNCIPE

6.       SHo TomC and Principeevolvedfrom a Marxist rule regime after independenceto a
multi-party political system in the 1990s. STP was under Portugal's rule until 1974 when
socialist economic policies were introduced under a single mamist party. Due to economic
deterioration during the 1980s and pressure from both the population and Western donors, a
democratic constitution was formulated and the first multi-party legislative election was held in
January 1991.

7.       Since 1991 the democratic political system has been marked by instability and
frequent turnover of Governments'. Inaddition, there were two brief and bloodless coups in
1995 and in2003 and members o f the elite police force seized the Si50 TomC police headquarters
in October and November 2007 demanding payment of a bonus and other benefits. In 2006,
legislative, regional and local elections were won by the President's party, the Movimento
Democrhtico das Forqas da Mudanqa (MDFM) which, together with the Partido da ConvergCncia
Democratica (PCD), formed a minority government with the support o f 23 out o f the 55 seats in
the National Assembly. In July 2006, President Fradique de Menezes was reelected for his
second and last tenure.

8.       A new government coalition has been formed in February 2008 with a majority in
the National Assembly. After a Cabinet reshuffle in November 2007, the minority coalition
government submitted the 2008 Budget to the National Assembly in January 2008 but, given its
likely failure to obtain the necessary support, the government withdrew it from discussions before
the final vote was called. Thereafter, the Prime Minister stepped down and a new government
was formed in February 2008, in coalition with an opposition party, the Acqi5o Democratica
Independente (ADI). As a result, the new Government now holds a majority in the National




ISince 2001 when the current President was elected, the country has had seven Prime Ministers.

Assembly (35 out o f the 55 seats), which is expected to facilitate approval o f key legislation in
the NationalAssembly.

                     B.        SOCIAL CONTEXT IN SA0 TOMEAND PRiNCIPE

9.        The 2006 UNDP Human Development Report ranks SHo Tom6 and Principe 123'd
out of 177 countries, comparable to oil producing middle income countries in the region such as
Gabon (119) and Equatorial Guinea (127). There i s a relative paucity o f data on poverty with the
most recent household survey dating to 2001. This survey showed a deterioration inpoverty, with
poverty incidence estimated at 54 percent (including 15 percent inextreme poverty), compared to
42 percent recorded in 1990. Sector analysis and administrative data indicate that there has been
an improvement since 2001 inhealth and education indicators that remain above the Sub-Saharan
region average (Table 1and Annex 5).

 10.      In education, STP received Education for All-Fast Track Initiative endorsement in
November 2007 and i s pursuing structural reforms aimed at reaching universal primary
completion by 2015. It now faces the need to expand secondary education which i s being pursued
through implementation o f sector reforms. In the context o f these reforms, public education
expenditures have increased to 8.6 percent o f GDP in 2006 compared to 2.7 percent o f GDP in
2002. Although the official primary net enrollment ratio stood at 97 percent in 2006 (above the
Sub-Saharan average o f 71 percent), the quality o f education i s still wanting reflecting the low
level o f teachers' qualification and the limited learningtime associated with a triple shift regime.
STP spends a large proportion o f its education budget at the tertiary level, namely through foreign
study scholarships. Progress in education has been achieved in the primary completion rate,
jointly with a reduction in the repetition rate, which may be associated to some reduction in the
triple shift regime.

 11.      A Multi Indicators Cluster Survey on Mother and Child Health was completed in 2006
providing up-dated data and evidence that health sector reforms are starting to have an impact on
maternity and child health outcomes (Table 1). The survey data show considerable success inthe
area o f infant mortality which, now at 61 per 1,000 live births, stands well below the Sub-Saharan
average. This has helped maintain the under-five mortality rate at reasonable levels. Maternal
mortality rates have also declined substantially. The reasons behind these improvements, in
addition to strong government commitment, are successful donor-supported health sector
interventions to improve service delivery and an emphasis on preventive care (Box 1). These
health sector outcomes are encouraging but efforts will be needed to maintain the path o f reforms
and ensure sustainability.

 12.        These gains notwithstanding public delivery o f social services in STP remains
constrained by the inability o f Government and stakeholders to assess both the degree to which
strategies are implemented and their impact. The recently prepared JSAN signaled poor data
collection, compilation, interpretation and dissemination and an inadequate evaluation and
monitoring system for the MDGs. In addition, the recent PEMFAR highlighted that pro-poor
social expenditures have a limited impact due to sector strategies that are not fully consistent with
the annual budget allocations and the long-term strategy set inthe PRSP.

13.         Improved macroeconomic performance following economic reforms starting in
1999. Emerging from many years o f relative instability and isolation, STP engaged in a first set
o f reforms in 1999. These aimed at: (i)pursuing prudent fiscal and monetary policies; (ii)
improving the efficiency o f public spending; (iii)liberalizing the economy by reforming the
import tariff structure, preparing for liberalization o f the telecoms sector and privatizing a number
o f public enterprises; (iv) accelerating reforms by developing new strategies in health and
education; and (v) building institutional capacities, especially in the nascent petroleum sector.
This first round o f reforms was followed by a second round in 2004 in the context of the HIPC



                                                               4

facility which has provided the country with a total o f US$ 314 million of debt relief innominal
terms. Oil exploration which started in 1998 gathered momentum in 2001 with the signature o f
the Joint STP-Nigeria Treaty to exploit petroleum in an area o f overlapping maritime boundary
claims (see paragraph 82). As a result o f these reforms, an improvement in world cocoa prices,
and buoyant activity inthe tourism and construction sectors, real GDP growth rose from 3 percent
to 6.8 percent between 2000 and 2003.

14.       Sustained high economic growth. GDP growth, which slowed down to about 4.5
percent in 2004-05 due to political instability and low levels o f investment, bounced back to an
average o f 6.4 percent in 2006 and 2007 (Figure 1 and Table 2 in Annex 1) largely correlated
with foreign direct investment (FDI) in construction and tourism in anticipation o f potential oil
production. The use o f oil signature bonuses by the government also helped buoy further
economic activity. Inthis context, the services sector, now accounting for more than halfo f GDP,
has started to take a significant role in the economy. Tourism has become the most dynamic
sector and the primary source of foreign exchange for the country, with more than 40 percent o f
total exports earnings in 2005-06. Real GDP growth i s also correlated with external assistance
that financed on average 78 percent of public investments between 2000 and 2005 and i s one o f
the main drivers of domestic investment. It is the agricultural sector that now needs to contribute
more to overall growth; it represented only 10.5 percent o f GDP in 2005. There i s undoubtedly a
large potential in the sector which provides livelihood for 30 percent o f the active population
(2003), mostly informally (Figure l).'

15.       Improved fiscal stance but sustainability concernsremain. Fiscalperformance (Table
3 inAnnex 1) has benefitedgreatly from the implementation o f relatively prudent policies, strong
revenue collection and use o f oil bonuses. Revenue increased from 27.6 percent o f GDP in 2000
to 37.1 percent in 2006 due to the introduction o f new taxes, rising tax rates, elimination o f
exceptions, and improved tax collection, including simplification o f custom procedures. In
addition, the budget received US$37.9 million from the National Oil Account (NOA)3between


 STP is located at the Equator and is known to be well endowed with fertile soil and abundant water resources.
 The National Oil Account was created after the 2004 Oil Revenue Management Law to deposit all oil revenues.
Specific mechanisms are in place to restrict the amount o f such revenues that can be used for annual budgetary
expenditures. More inparagraphs 84 and 85.

2005 and 2007 (see paragraph 85). These budgetary inflows allowed the government to increase
expenditures to 51percent o f GDP in 2006 with large annual fluctuations to accommodate social
demands in a very volatile political environment. Current expenditures increased from 14.7
percent o f GDP in 2000 to 28.7 percent in 2006 squeezing investment spending to 20 percent o f
GDPin2006 compared with 24.1 percent o f GDP in2000. The wage billinparticularreachedthe
level o f 8.7 percent o f GDP in 2006 compared to around 5 percent in 2002, reducing the fiscal
space for needed expenditure in goods and services. The year 2007 registered a substantial
correction in public finances as oil revenues were buoyed by signature bonuses and current and
capital expenditures were reduced -- the latter due mainly to a reduction in foreign grants, which
was offset by HIPC resources. Although fiscal discipline has been broadly maintained in the
framework o f the PRGF, the domestic non-oil primary deficit4for 2007 remains at 8.1 percent o f
GDP (compared to 10.1 percent in 2005) and raises concerns about overall fiscal sustainability
once oil bonuses run out (Figure 1). In September 2007, the Government increased the tariffs for
energy and water by 50 percent to compensate the electricity and water and sanitation company
(EMAE)for risingoil prices andunchangedtariffs since October 2004.

 16.       Weak financial situation of State Owned Enterprises. The government undertook a
sizeable program o f privatization in 2000-01 in an attempt to fully or partially withdraw from
economic sectors that were considered best served by private companies. As a result, it remains
today the only shareholder o f four fully state-owned enterprises considered essential in
developing key economic sectors'. These companies are EMAE (Energy and Water and
Sanitation), ENASA (Airport services), ENAPORT (Port services), and Correios (Postal
services). They jointly employed 527 employees in 2005 or 15 percent o f the public sector
employment (excluding the military and police force) and generated combined annual revenues
close to US$16 million, equal to 14 percent o f GDP. The elimination o f government subsidies in
2002 coupled with lack o f public investment and the obligation to transfer to the Treasury all
profits earned have strongly undermined their financial position and in 2005 EMAE and ENASA
incurred large losses, while ENAPORT and CORREIOS reported small profits. This in turn has
translated into higher contingent liabilities for the Government as the only owner o f these SOEs.

17.       Poor service provision of public utilities. Reduced investment and operation and
maintenance expenditures have led to irregular and poor quality service provision and payment
arrears to suppliers and the Government. As a result o f these weaknesses, STP continues to suffer
from low levels o f electrification (42 percent) and sanitation coverage (25 percent). Tourism the
main source o f foreign exchange i s constrained by poor airport conditions that limit the size o f
airplanes landing in the country and unreliable and expensive electricity and water that increase
the cost incurredby private hotels and restaurants. In addition, port services, the principal gate o f
entry o f imports are expensive and unreliable due to the lack o f a deep sea water port, increasing
the cost o f imports and hamperingexport expansion.

18.       Difficulties to control inflation.Inflation, which had dropped to less than 10percent by
2003, reached 27.6 percent at end-December 2007 (Figure 2). While the expansionary fiscal
policy and accommodating monetary management over the last three years provide the backdrop
to this rising trend, two other factors explain the large spike in prices in 2007: the dollar
depreciation and soaring international oil and food prices partially passed through to consumers.
Indeed, excluding food and energy prices, inflation amounted to around 10 percent in2007. The

  The domestic non-oil primary deficit excludes oil revenues, grants, interest earned, scheduled interest payments,
foreign financed scholarships and foreign financed capital.
  The government also participates in the capital o f a few other enterprises: 51 percent o f ENCO (a petroleum
importing and distribution company), 49 percent o f CST Telecom, 40 percent o f Banco International STP, and 30
percent o f Air S2o Tomi.

remoteness, small size, and fragmented nature o f the country (Principe island i s 150 k m s away
from S2o Tome island) are known to be o f particular disadvantage notably with a considerable
amount o f supply disruptions and speculation in2007. The Central Bank i s formally committed to
maintain a tight monetary policy to counter inflation pressures but i s seriously limited by the
underdeveloped state o f financial intermediation in the country and the need to accumulate
foreign reserves especially given the very volatile external environment. At end-2007, net official
reserves exceeded the PRGF target by US$5.6 million. Finally, the Central Bank i s intensifying
efforts to improve its supervision capacity that i s still weak due to shortage o f skilled staff and
limited reliable information.

19.      STP's financial sector suffers from the common weaknesses associated with small states
such as narrow market base, costly infrastructure, lack o f skilled personnel, etc. As a result
interest rates have traditionally been high, currently exceeding 30 percent. An Anti-money
Laundering law in line with the UNGlobal Program o f fight against Money Laundering has been
passed by the National Assembly in April 17, 2008. This law aims to prevent and combat money
laundering, preventing economic and organized crime. It also looks at fostering coordination o f
agencies in charge o f financial supervision, monitoring and control and providing assistance and
training o f qualified personnel to study the African and international reality for better
implementationo f the legislation.

20.      Structural external deficit, dependency on aid flows and vulnerability to terms of
trade. Exports o f goods and services represented 13 percent o f GDP in 2006 with cocoa
representing the main traditional export commodity (37 percent o f exports o f goods). However
tourism has surpassed cocoa interms o f export earnings, representing 41 percent o f total export o f
goods and services in 2006. Imports o f goods represented 44 percent o f GDP in 2007 and
included a broad range o f products from food to oil due to insularity and limited domestic
production. The current account deficit (excluding official transfers) averaged 37 percent o f GDP
between 2000 and 2005, financed mainly by official aid flows (around 29 percent o f GDP), rising
FDIfor tourism, construction and oil exploration(5.7 percent o f GDP). Since 2005 payments for
oil signature bonuses have become an additional source o f foreign capital inflows. These inflows
have helped increase official reserves to four months o f imports (Figure 2). STP's terms o f trade
are extremely sensitive to international price fluctuations, particularly o f cocoa and oil.

21.       Flexible exchange rate has prevented real exchange appreciationThe managed-float
exchange rate regime has helped to contain the impacts o f volatile prices for cocoa and oil.
Persistent inflation has depreciated the dobra 60 percent relative to the U S dollar since 2001 and
prevented persistent real exchange rate appreciation (Figure 3). The government aims at
diversifying the economy to foster economic growth with special focus on tourism and
agriculture. The plan i s to identify the institutional constraints the agricultural sector faces and
identify agricultural crops with export potential as well as inputsrequired to improve productivity
inthe sector. This will help to develop rural employment (including non-farm employment) and
reduce poverty. A hike in agricultural productivity and export promotion should increase overall
productivity and facilitate the transition to an oil producing economy with limited impact on the
real exchange rate.

22.       The Completion Point under the Enhanced HIPC initiativewas reached in March
2007 but the risk of debt distress remains high. The successful implementation o f its reform
program enabled ,990 Tom6 and Principe to reach Completion Point under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative on March 15, 2007 and to receive additional debt relief (topping-up and MDRI) in the
amount o f US$3 14 million in nominal terms (Figure 3). However the recent Debt Sustainability
Analysis for low income countries shows that S9o Tome and Principe's risk o f debt distress will
remain high until oil production starts. Despite a significant reduction in the net present value o f
debt at the HIPC Completion Point, Silo Tom6 and Principe's public debt (estimated at 15.9
percent o f GDP in 2007) will also be vulnerable to shocks to the exchange rate, and volatility o f
exports and foreign grants, at least until oil production stark6External debt vulnerability would
be further exacerbated in the absence o f sound macroeconomic policies and undue delays in oil
production. These risks underscore the need for prudent fiscal and debt management policies,
continued reliance on concessional financing, and implementation o f structural reforms that
support broad-based, long-term economic growth and diversification.' Furthermore, this calls for
sustained concessional support inthe interim period untiloil production.

23.      Macroeconomic objectives. Sgo Tom6 and Principe's macroeconomic objectives for
2008-2009 have been formulated in collaboration with the IMFunder a PRGF program. The main
targets for 2008 are to: (i)   achieve an annual real GDP growth rate o f 6 percent; (ii) annual     limit
inflation to 13-15 percent bythe end o f 2008; and (iii)         maintain gross international reserves above
the 4 months o f imports threshold. Moreover, the program aims to reduce the domestic non-oil
primary deficit to 5.2 percent o f GDP in2008 and 4.2 percent o f GDP by 2009. The GDP growth
projection i s achievable assuming prudent fiscal policy that adjusts to drawings from the National
Oil Account (NOA), appropriate levels o f capital expenditure and PRSP implementation, and
continued FDIand grant support from foreign donors. Growth would be driven by continued oil
exploration, investment in construction, and tourism inflows. Three hotels are currently under
construction, one o f them scheduled to be completed mid-2008. Supply constraints in the power
sector are likely to be reduced with the prospective arrival o f foreign investment in the sectora8
These factors would help foster growth in agriculture and the services sectors. In this context,
STP's economic growth in the next few years would keep in line with the levels realized in the
last three years. Continued implementation o f prudent monetary policy and budgetary restraint i s
expected to reduce inflation to 7 percent by end 2009. Key macroeconomic indicators for the
medium-term macroeconomic framework are presentedinTable 2 inAnnex 1.

24.      The fiscal framework for 2008 aims to reduce the domestic non-oil primary budget
deficit to 5.2 percent o f GDP from 8.1 percent o f GDP in2007, inparticular to adjust to shrinking
financing from the NOA (Table 3 inAnnex 1). As no new oil bonuses are foreseen after 2008, the
authorities have initiated progressive fiscal adjustment inthe context o f the PRGFprogram, based
on the reduction o f non-essential current expenditures and the containment o f the wage bill
(Figure 4). Following adoption o f the new tax legislation, tax and non-tax revenues are expected
to decline slightly in line with a reduction in tax rates (see paragraph 77). Oil signature bonuses
also will be reduced to 16.4 percent o f GDP in 2008 from 21.1 percent o f GDP in 2007 (See
paragraph 85) which will be partly offset by non HIPC external grants - these are expected to
increase to 11.9 percent o f GDP. Government spending i s projected to decline to 33.3 percent o f
GDP following containment in recurrent expenditure by around 6.5 percent o f GDP, with the
wage bill reduced to 8.6 percent o f GDP. Capital expenditures are expected to remain at 11.5
percent o f GDP, mainly financed by foreign aid. Expenditures made from the HIPC account that
includes the savings realized from debt forgiveness will remain at 2.6 percent o f GDP. Taking
into account the expected oil signature bonuses and the debt forgiveness to be granted in 2008 the
overall fiscal balance (on a commitment basis and including grants) i s projectedto show a surplus
o f 40.6 percent o f GDP in 2008 which will be used to finance external debt service obligations
and restore adequate balances inthe NOA.

25.       This operation will assure full realization of the 2008 Budget objectives under the
PRGF.The domestic non-oil primary budget deficit o f 5.2 percent o f GDP in2008 is expectedto
be fully financed by a small withdrawal from the NOA, as well as other net external financing
including debt relief and funds from this operation. As mentioned in paragraph 24, the sharp
decrease in the use o f oil bonuses reflects the depletion o f the NOA. Consequently, the
concessional nature o f external assistance i s essential to avoid exacerbating the debt situation o f
STP.

26.       External Position. STP's external targets for 2008 are in line with the commitments
under the PRGF. Gross official reserves amounting to US$38 million at end-2007 represent 5.1
months o f import coverage. A widening o f the current account deficit (excluding grants) from
39.5 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 52 percent o f GDP in 2008 i s expected driven mainly by higher
imports for oil exploration and increasedprices of petroleum and food imports. Table 4 inAnnex
1 shows that this deficit is fully covered by the flows of foreign aid (20 percent o f GDP), oil
signature bonuses (16 percent o f GDP) and foreign direct investment, notably in the construction
and tourism sectors as well as oil related exploration (20 percent o f GDP). With these
macroeconomic projections, STP's external debt i s expected to remain below the 2007 level.
Debt servicing i s expected to remain at about 6 percent of export earnings inthe next few years.

27.       Medium-term macroeconomic prospects and the oil scenarios. The medium-term
macroeconomic framework assumes that a last bonus payment, for blocks 5 and 6 in the JDZ, o f
US$ 26.1 million will be disbursed in 2008 (Figure 5). Inthe absence o f any new bonuses in the
JDZ andor inthe Exclusive Economic Zone, the authorities will have to rely on existing funds in
the NOA to breach the period until oil production starts, currently foreseen around 2014. If this
bonus i s paid, the NOA balance would suffice to breach that interim period assuming US$4
million allocation to the budget in 2009 and 2010 and US$4.5 million thereafter. At this rate, the
NOA funds could cover the interim period until oil production starts even until 2019. Incase the
last bonus payment i s not received, the NOA would last until 2012 and would require a flexible
interpretation o f the O W L 9to avoid a large fall in aggregate demand. Inthat case and to avoid
further scaling back investment, the government should start retrenching further current

 The ORML foresees that a maximum o f 20 percent o f the NOA balance at the end o f the fiscal year can be allocated
to finance the following year's budget.

expenditure in 2009 in line with the fiscal discipline adopted in 2008. In the long run, current
fiscal policies are not sustainable if petroleum i s not commercially exploited. It is in this context
that the STP government aims to diversify its economy and foster domestic growth. Ifpetroleum
i s commercially exploited, a programmed phase out o f foreign grants will be needed to ensure a
balanced transition to the potential oil era and avoid a drastic reduction inneeded funds to breach
the interimperiod.

28,       Impact of internationalcommodity prices. Current trends ininternational commodity
prices affect negatively STP that, due to insularity relies heavily on a large variety o f imports,
including food," and has a limited range o f exports. Recent estimated terms o f trade show a
negative shock o f 9.8 percent o f GDP" in 2007 which implies that at current international prices,
an additional US$14 million i s required to maintain the 2006 trade balance. The government has
taken some measures to mitigate the impact o f this price hike on the poor, particularly the impact
o f the 68 percent water and electricity tariff increase in 2007 motivated by rising fuel prices.
Tariffs for poor households'* will receive an implicit subsidy by rising 46 percent (to 0.2 percent
o f GDP) the government's utilitybill in 2007 to compensate the Energy company for a lower that
requested household tariff hike. In 2008, this subsidy i s expected to reach US$0.5 million (0.3
percent of GDP).




lo Year- on-year food inflation started to accelerate inmid-2007 to reach 36 percent inJanuary 2008.


I' The Term of Trade shock was calculated using price changes of the first two months o f the year (i.e. changes
between the average of January and February of 2007 and 2008) for 2006 and 2007 volumes in main imports and
exports. Fuel and food, the two import goods considered, saw price increases o f 68 and 36 percent respectively over the
period while cocoa, the export good considered, saw price increases by 23 percent for the same period

l2 Households have three tiers o f tariffs according to consumption levels (less than 100Kwh; between 100 and 300
Kwh; above 300 Kwh). The latter did not get an (implicit) subsidy. The lowest consumption got the most part o f the
subsidy, a reduction of 25.6 percent intariffs compared to the original tariff proposed and the middle consumers got a
reduction o f 16.7 percent compared to the original tariff propose. Commercial and industrial users did not get a tariff
reduction.

                                              E.         GOVERNANCE

29.       Improvement in Governance. A large program o f public finance management
strengthening i s underway (see paragraph 46) including the approval o f an Organic Law for
Public Finance Management (SAFE law) in 2007. Oil revenue management i s deemed to meet
international standards o f governance with the approval o f the Oil Revenue Management Law
(ORML) in2004. Also, additional efforts are underway inthe justice and business environment.
These successes notwithstanding, STP continues to face key challenges notably with respect to
weak domestic accountability, corruption, and uneven implementation and weak coordination o f
the core reforms.

30.       Considerable progress in economic and financial governance. Preparation o f the 2008
Budget followed closely the stipulations o f the Organic Law on Public Finance Management that
was passed in 2007. The biggest achievement was the introduction o f new budget codes which for
the first time allowed a functional classification o f operations. A budget implementation system
that links the Directorate o f Treasury and Budget has been set up in 2007, strengthening budget
control, monitoring, and reporting. These reforms, supported by an IDA-supported Technical
Assistance project, should facilitate a better translation o f PRSP priorities and sector policies into
the budget, and help in the supervision o f PRSP implementation (see paragraphs 65 to 75).
Reforms o f the procurement law and procedures as well as internal controls are beingprepared in
order to improve budget control and enhance public expenditure transparency and effectiveness.

31.       Significant advances in petroleum revenue governance despite setbacks in 2007.
Approval o f the Oil Revenue Management Law (ORML) in 2004, was followed by official
commitments to implement the EITI and the Abuja Declaration for supervision o f the Joint
Development Zone (JDZ) shared with Nigeria. In line with these engagements, the National
Assembly passed legislation for the set up o f the PetroleumOversight Committee and the Public
Registration and Information Office to audit and monitor oil revenue flows and disseminate oil
related information. The progress registered however slowed down sharply in 2007 with some
signals o f disengagement to the transparency agenda on petroleum management. First, the
Directors o f the National PetroleumAgency were removedwhich has delayed the work agenda in
this sector, particularly the activities for the promotion and preparation o f open bidding o f the
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Second, the previous government presented to the National
Assembly a proposal to modify the existing Oil Revenue Management Law with the view to
introducing the option o f direct negotiation o f petroleum contract^'^. According to this plan,
direct negotiations would be possible inexceptional cases inthe EEZ for up to a third o f the EEZ
acreage, which would severely compromise the participation and interest o f qualified companies
inthe process and would be incontradictionwith the fundamental principles of good governance
and transparency which are the foundations o f the joint Bank and the Government o f SBo Tom6
and Principe (GoSTP) collaboration. The National Assembly rejected the proposal in early 2008
and the new government formed inFebruary, 2008 has now re-activated the activities to complete
the petroleum sector legal and contractual framework as well as the technical and economic
studies for the promotion and bidding o f blocks in the Exclusive Economic Zone in 2008 (see
paragraph 84).

32.       The new government also aims to invigorate the governance agenda within the
implementationof the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Reengaging into
the strategy agreed with the Bank with regard to governance in the petroleum sector, the


l3The Government's view at that time was that given the low prospect and high investmentrisk in the EEZ relative to
the JDZ, foreign partners could not be attracted into this STP's deep offshore zone without more favorable conditions.

Government has submitted to the National Assembly the draft National Petroleum Sector Law
and approved the Model Contract for production sharing in line with international standards o f
transparency and competition. Directors o f the National Petroleum Agency are being identified.
Inaddition, supported by this operation, the government plans to publishthe Handbook of Oil
Management Law and adopt the PetroleumDevelopment Strategy in June 2008. The Government
aims at producing the first EITI report as part o f its commitment to the implementation o f the
EITIafter beingaccepted as candidate country inFebruary.

33.      Improvingthe justice system. The judicial system faces daunting challenges which the
government i s addressing through implementation o f reforms in a few priority areas.              The
problems in STP's justice system include: (i) indispensation o fjustice due to backlogs and
                                                delays
an antiquated legal system, including civil and criminal procedure laws which date back to the
19th Century, and as such are unsuited to a global market economy; (ii)         insufficient technical
capacity and human resources especially to address issues o f globalized economic management;
(iii)pressures and challenges related to the anticipation ofoil explorationandproduction --
including technological, economic and political issues; (iv) corruption; (v) insufficient
dissemination o f legal information both within the justice sector and to the public and investors;
and (vi) weak administration o f justice and registries. The reforms underway which are being
supported by the Portuguese government aim at improving the economic and financial legal
framework (such as the proposed Criminal Code and Criminal Procedural Code and Anti-Money
Laundering Law), as well as capacity building through training and dissemination.                  The
Government also aims to develop commercial arbitration as a more viable alternative to the courts
following on the passage o f the Voluntary Arbitration Law in 2006. This option i s in particular
muchmore appropriate for small economies at low levels o f development.


      111. THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMAND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

34.      The PRSP was adopted in 2003 following an extensive consultative process with
stakeholders. The process was managed by a steering committee chaired by the Prime Minister
and consisting o f representatives o f government and civil society. Numerous workshops were
organized for civil society, political parties and other stakeholders inthe six districts on the island
o f ,320 Tom6 and on the island o f Principe. A PRSP unit was set up in 2004 in the Ministry o f
Planning and Finance to ensure the implementation and monitoring o f the PRSP, coordinating all
Ministries, private sector and civil society under the overall fkamework o f the PRSP. The PRSP
was endorsed by the Boards o f the World Bank and IMF in April and M a y 2005, respectively.
The delay in the PRSP submission was related to the government's effort to strengthen the
macroeconomic framework. The original full PRSP document was supplemented by an extensive
implementation annex for the years 2003-2005. Joint Staff Advisory Notes (JSAN) were
presented to the Bank's Board o f Executive Directors in September 2006 and April 2008,
emphasizing the need to undertake further poverty diagnostic, cost and prioritize sector strategies,
attract private investment and donor support, enhance institutional capacity to ensure full
implementation, monitoring and evaluation o f the PRSP, as well as macroeconomic and political
stability.

35.      The poverty strategy sets an ambitious policy agenda with an overall cost of about
US$210 million for the first seven years of implementation. It lays out a strategic plan for
poverty reduction based on five pillars: (i)   reform o f public institutions, capacity building, and
promotion o f good governance; (ii)accelerated and redistributive growth; (iii)creation o f
opportunities to increase and diversify income for the poor; (iv) human resource development and
access to basic social services; and (v) adoption o f mechanisms to monitor, assess and update the



                                                  13

strategy. The Government has translated the PRSP into a medium-term reformprogram called the
Priority Action Plan (PAP) 2006-08 focused on: (i)       attaining a GDP growth rate o f 5 percent
starting in 2003; (ii)halving poverty incidence by 2010, and further to 1/3 by 2015; (iii)
providing the entire population with access to basic services by 2015 and help improve their
quality o f life; (iv) reducingthe social and gender gap between districts in SHo Tom6 and between
these and the Autonomous Region o f Principe, as well as between urban and rural populations;
and (v) promoting and buildinginstitutional capacity and a policy o f good governance.

36.       Several additional sector strategies have been formulated over the last few years in
addition to the PAP. In the framework o f the World Bank Technical Assistance Capacity
Building project, the government has developed action plans to improve public finance
management, develop public accounts and a modem procurement system as well as bring
petroleum revenue management in line with the EITI. The authorities also developed a health
sector strategy for 2001-05 mainly focused on primary health and the strengthening o f human
resources and institutional capacity with an estimated budget o f US$24.2 million for the period.
The education strategy for the period 2003-13 was adopted in 2004 and focused on primary
education, universal enrolment at the basic education level, and quality improvement. Finally, the
authorities are developing a growth strategy that will help to identify priorities for a revised
poverty reduction strategy.

37.      The proposed operation is consistent with the government's implementation of the
PRSP and supports its efforts to initiatea new PRSP. The 2008 budget and program (Grandes
Opqdes do Plano) was presented to the National Assembly in April 2008. The priorities are to
reduce and simplify taxation in order to foster private investment and accelerate economic
growth; favor public-private partnerships to improve utility services provision; improve
efficiency o f the public sector to reduce poverty, and adopt new petroleum legislation in the
context o f an expected round o f bidding in STP's Exclusive Economic Zone in 2008. As the
Government's Priority Action Plan 2006-08 comes to an end and following the recommendation
o f the recent Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) on the Poverty Reduction ImplementationReport,
the authorities have decided to initiate the preparation o f a new PRSP. The aim i s for the new
PRSP to build on the lessons learnt from the implementation o f the current PRSP and to
incorporate a more realistic assessment o f oil prospects.       A growth diversification strategy
currently being prepared, paying more attention to the productive and economic sectors as well as
the small size o f the country, will also be formulated for inclusion into the next PRSP. With
support from the UNDP, the authorities are already preparing the costing o f policies required to
reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2015. The Bank will assist in developing
the diversification and growth strategy that would also feed into the up-coming Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM). These activities are being supported by a Policy and Human
Resources Development (PHRD) grant.

38.      The recent PEMFAR showed that the share o f social expenditures in the total current
expenditure has been a steady 30 percent since 2001, showing the long-term government's
commitment to social sectors. In line with this, the 2008 budget allocates 12.2 percent o f total
expenditure to education, 9.9 percent to health, 7.8 percent to housing and 2.8 to social security
representing substantial increases over past years. An important policy and coherence issue i s that
the budget allocations and programs are not fully aligned with the PRSP. This i s due not only to
the weak institutional infrastructure in place but also to the fact that expenditures are heavily
driven by donor's financing objectives, not always aligned with Government priorities.

               IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

                                        A.      LINKTOCAS

39.      The DPO supports the Government prioritiesand are in line with the FY06-FY09
CAS objectives of: (i)     supporting the implementation o f the PRSP and strengthening the areas
where the PRSP needs to be improved, including the macroeconomic and public sector context;
and (ii) providing assistance to SHo Tom6 and Principe to ensure that it i s sufficiently prepared to
maximize the benefits o f future oil revenues.

40.      The CAS outlines a gradual move to Development Policy Operations (budget
support). The CAS states that a series o fDPOs could be envisaged starting inFY07 triggeredby
sound macroeconomic, public finance and oil management, closely linked to the PRSP Annual
Progress Reports and prepared in collaboration with donors. The prerequisites mentioned in the
CAS for moving to DPOs are: (i)     the need to strengthen the overall strategy outlined inthe PRSP,
particularly to prepare annual priority action programs; (ii)a medium-term program for
strengthening the fiduciary framework to ensure transparency and financial safeguards; and (iii)     a
need to identify a clear set o f monitorable indicators around which future budgetary support
operations could be aligned. On (i)the government i s already implementing the 2006-2008
Priority Action Plan that details PRSP implementation and has submitted the relevant
implementationreports in2006 and 2007. On (ii)       the fiduciary framework i s being strengthened,
supported by the Bank Technical Assistance Capacity Building project, and key PFM reforms
were approved in 2007 (new organic public finance management law, new budget nomenclature,
new integratedcomputerizedbudget system). On (iii)      the team has presented a set o f indicators to
monitor the DPO and will work with the authorities to further strengthen its system to provide
time bound relevant indicators. Rather than entering a series o f operations under the CAS, this
operation recognizes the cumulative reformefforts invarious areas over the CAS period.

                 B.        COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHERDONORS

41.      IMF-Bank Coordination. The programs o f the Bank and the Fund have been closely
coordinated. The HIPC Completion Point Document was jointly prepared by Bank and Fund staff
and completed by the Boards o f the two institutions in March 2007. The staffs o f IDA and the
IMF have coordinated the contents o f the DPO and the on-going PRGF program to ensure that
these budget-support instruments complement each other. PFMmeasures supported by the PRGF
program are in large part drawn from the Bank's Technical Assistance project. The reform
program underpinning the proposed operation i s consistent with the macroeconomic program
supported by the PRGF.14

42.      Coordinationwith other donors. The strategic focus, contents, and triggers ofthe DPO
have been presented to staff o f the European Union which may provide budgetary assistance in
the future. Moreover, Bank staff has consulted closely with other major donors such as AfDB,
UNDP, Portugal, France and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) who are providing
technical assistance for budgetary management and other reforms. Portugal has a multi-year
project that provides Technical Assistance and Training, both in SHo Tom6 and Principe and in
Portugal, encompassing all areas o f the MoPF and including a resident macroeconomic advisor.
France participated in the preparation o f the CFAA. The M C C recently approved a threshold
project o f US$7.4 million that supports revenue collection (tax and customs compliance) and



l4STP is not a member of IFC andMIGA.


                                                  15

improvement in the business envir~nment'~and the EU finances technical assistance on
macroeconomic management to the MoPF.

43.       European Union. The EU has been implementing with STP its Ninth European
Development Fund (2003-07) (EUR 14.8 million). Two projects for a total o f EUR 10.8 million
are being implementedto rehabilitate and maintainroads, mostly based on local labor and limited
use o f foreign capital. Self-sustainability o f the Maintenance and Rehabilitation Fund by the
government, based on a five percent petroleum surtax seems difficult given current budget
tightening and world oil market prices. Starting in 2009, the Tenth European Development Fund
with EUR 17.1 million covering the period 2008-2013 will be implementedkeepingthe focus on
the transport sector (EUR 13.3 million). It i s yet to be decided whether this will be in the form o f
an investment or sector budget support operation.

44.       AfDB. The objective o f the 2005-09 assistance strategy o f the AfDB Group is to support
the Government's efforts to implement the PRSP in order to reach the MDGs. The indicative
country allocationi s US$6.8 millioninthe form o f grants. This strategy will be articulated around
two pillars: (i)poverty reduction in rural areas; and (ii)               promotion o f governance in Public
Finance Management. The first pillar helps promote and diversify the country's economic base,
especially the agricultural and rural sector, and reinforce operations in the social sectors. Under
this pillar, the livestock development support project-phase I1was approved inMay 200616.The
second pillar supports macroeconomic reforms and governance through an institutional support
project on governance and a technical assistance on the PRSP process. These will help improve
public finance management and institutional capacity to prepare the country for the forthcoming
oil era. Given the considerable needs for institutional capacity building, the AfDB will finance
strategic economic and sector studies such as the Country Governance Profile; the joint study
with the World Bank on the integrated fiduciary assessment; a transport sector study; and the
insular costs study. Furthermore, the AfDB will finance regional capacity building initiatives,
within CEMAC, ECCAS, the African Portuguese-speakingcountries and the small islandstates.

45.       UNDP.The objective ofthe 2007-11strategy of the UNDP is to support the Government
at local and central levels to promote human development, gender equality and reduce poverty by
two thirds by 2015. The strategy, financed by US$2.5 million o f own resources and US$2.8
million o f additional resources, will focus on three areas: (i)         poverty reduction to reach the MDGs
and tackle HIV/AIDS; (ii) governance to the benefit o f potential oil revenues; and (iii)
                                   good
environment and energy management for sustainable environment.




IsThe MCC threshold program will assist the government to improve tax revenues, strengthening administrative
capacity at the Tax and Customs Directorates and foster private sector growth by improving administrative and
regulatory business registration procedures. The most expected outcomes are an increase in the number o f registered
taxpayers, stronger collection o f accumulated arrears, streamlined customs procedures and reduced time and cost of
reducing businesses. Upon successful completion o f the reforms in these areas STP will become eligible for full MCC
support.
l6The AfDB has three ongoing projects inwater and sanitation and hydrous diseases, human resource development and
agriculture. Two o f these projects have started recently, namely the human resource development project in 2005
(US$5.3 million from the African Development Fund and U S 0 . 8 million grant from the Technical Assistance Facility)
to improve cross-sectoral capacity-building by providing for training in literacy, information, and community
organization, as well as specialized vocational training and the second phase o f the livestock development project to
helpdiversify the economy approved inMay 2006 (USS5.9 million).

                      c.     RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER BANKOPERATIONS

46.      TechnicalAssistance Capacity Buildingproject. Since 2004, a World Bank Technical
Assistance Capacity Building project o f US$5 million has supported reforms in public finance
management, petroleum management and implementation o f the PRSP. This project has assisted
inthe preparation in 2007 o f the Organic Public Finance Management Law that lays the ground
for the country's fiduciary framework and institutional capacity for the management and
implementation o f budget support. The project has supported, among other things, the set up o f a
Computerized Integrated Financial Management Information System that links the directorate o f
Budget and the directorate o f Treasury in a single budget execution system at the central
government level and produces reports to facilitate budget control, monitoring and reporting that
can be broken down by functional, economic or administrative classification following the decree
on budget codes approved in 2007. The project also supports the reform on procurement, public
accounting, financial management, public assets management, payroll management, mediumterm
expenditure framework. The Petroleum management component o f the project assisted the
authorities in implementing the Oil Management Revenue Law, the set up o f the National
PetroleumAgency, and related institutions for improved governance inthe oil sector.

47.      IntegratedFrameworkprojects. The DTIS carried out by the World Bank in 2006-07
concluded with a set o f recommendations that were translated into two projects financed by the
Integrated Framework and implemented by the UNDP. These two projects, detailed below, will
assist the Government inimproving the business environment:

48.      The Technical Assistance to Capacity Building for the Directorate of Commerce
Project ($229,180; 18 months of implementation) aims at supporting the further integration of
SBo Tom6 and Principe into the international and regional economy by enhancing its capacity to
participate in trade related negotiations under the rules based system o f the World Trade
Organization (WTO). While it i s questionable whether SBo Tom6 and Principe should seek full
Membership of WTO at the present time, it i s clear that negotiations for beneficial agreements in
a regional and bilateral context are timely not least due to the coming o f the petroleum era when
investments and trade in goods and services are likely to increase substantially. SBo Tom6 and
Principe needs to be prepared for this situation in order to secure agreements within non-
petroleum sectors that will help the country build a long term, economically sustainable future
based on the country's endowments in renewable resources and services. The project focuses on
building capacity for trade policy design, strategic decision making and trade negotiation skills
through enhancement o f human resource capacity and associated trade related technical
assistance to the Directorate o f Commerce o f the Ministry o f Economy. Relevant bodies from
civil society and the private sector will also receive capacity building assistance with a view to
allow their participation inthe policy dialogue on a more equal footing.

49.      The Technical Assistance to Establish an Enabling Environment for Business
Development     - One  Stop Shop approachProject($395,255; 3 years o fimplementation) aims at
achieving the MDGs through increased private sector participation in the development process.
This will be achieved by establishing an appropriate business enabling environment through
Trade Related Technical Assistance (TRTA) to local capacity building in the field of trade and
investment promotion where a one window approach i s suggested. Capacity building within the
institutional framework for provision o f government regulatory services will also be enhanced
through the TRTA. Reviewing and rewriting the Commercial and Investment Codes i s the first
activity o f this project which will have repercussions on other activities such as simplifying the
business registration procedures.     The activities outlined in this project and the successes
achieved will constitute the starting point for the development of other activities relevant to


                                                 17

international trade integration in areas such as public private partnerships and investment, to be
submitted to the donor community duringthe future phases o f the Integrated Framework.

50.       A Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building Grant o f US$160,000 was approved
by the World Bank to the Ministry o f Planning and Finance in 2006 to support the development
o f a National Strategy for the Development o f Statistics and to strengthen statistical capacity.
The implementing agency (Instituto Nacional das Estatisticas) completed an assessment o f the
national statistical system in 2007. It was carried out through two surveys (from users and
producers o f statistics) and was validated in a workshop, with the Government and all sectors
involved. The conclusions from the report will be used to elaborate the statistics development
strategy. An extension o f the closing date o f the trust fund was agreed untilNovember 2009.

51.       A PHRD Trust Fund Grant o f US$0.6 million was approved in 2006 to assist the
Government to prepare the DPO. The main components o f the PHRD focus on State Owned
Enterprise (SOE) reforms, strengthening treasury management, the development o f a medium
term expenditure framework, and the preparation o f a growth study and related analysis to
prepare a new PRSP.

                                          D.        LESSONSLEARNED

52.       Move to budget support. The CAS analysis of previous Bank achievements in STP
suggests budget support as an instrument to assist the country given its small size and limited
human capacity. The CAS emphasizes that development policy operations coupled with
appropriate capacity building activities should be considered more effective and efficient in
delivering Bank's assistance. Development policy operations also provide more leverage to the
small amount o f IDA resources available to the country. The critical issue i s to ensure that there i s
appropriate design and timing o f such operations and that they build on the lessons learnt from
previous adjustment credits.

53.       Lessons learnt from previous budget support operations in the country. The last
budget support operation in STP, the Public Resource Management Credit (PRMC) was approved
in 2OOO."       The goal o f the US$7.5 million project was to support the government's
macroeconomic and structural reform program with respect to: (i)                 improving domestic resource
mobilization and the implementation o f a tariff reform; (ii)strengthening public expenditure
management; and (iii)       advancing public enterprise reform. The project was also expected to assist
the government's regional integration effort. The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) that
was completed in 2004 and rated the operation unsatisfactory highlighted that although the
objectives were timely and addressed the needs o f STP, they were also ambitious and wide
ranging and did not appropriately incorporate some o f the challenges that afflict small island
states. The project was relatively complex and underestimated institutional capacity and political
instability. Given these factors, the design o f the project (a quick release o f two tranches in a
short period o f two and half years and a final floating trance that was not actually disbursed) for
such a large reform programwas considered not appropriate.

54.       Mitigation measures based on CAS analysis and lessons learned from previous budget
support operations are: First, the importance o f national ownership o f the reforms. The main

"A PublicResourceManagementTechnicalAssistanceProject(US$2.5million) wasapprovedatthesametimeto
provide technical support to implement the PRSC, carry out studies to help prepare the PRSP and developthe agenda
of macroeconomic and sectoral reforms. The ICR in 2004 highlighted that the project could have benefited from a
closer definition ofproject's objectiveswith the schedule supportedby the PRMC andthe development of the PRSP.

components o f the DPO are derived from the Government's own reform program. Second, the
DPO should not be very ambitious, should be focused, and the project design should be simple.
The program being supported focuses on priority policy measures that are challenging but can be
implemented in 2008, taking into account institutional capacity. Although the reforms envisaged
are a medium-term process that requires sustained effort and strengthened institutional capacity,
as described inparagraph 13 the reform program in STP has been going on for the last eight years
and it has taken heightened intensity after the elections o f 2006. Also, the DPO concentrates on
few components with limited conditions and indicators to ease implementation and facilitate
supervision and the timing o f measures i s front loaded. Third, the need to appropriately link the
operation with Technical Assistance activities. In this regard, the Technical Assistance capacity
building project will continue assisting the government in the reform o f Public Finance
Management and oil revenue management, coupled with specific support from a PHRD grant to
assist the government in the overall preparation o f this DPO. Fourth, the increased leverage o f
donor collaboration, particularly with the IMF, and non-governmental stakeholder participation.
Collaboration with the IMF has been very fi-uitful during the implementation o f the PRGF and
will continue during the implementation o f the DPO. Coordination with other donors including
civil society will be fostered through regular round tables and meetings that the authorities have
started to organize in S5o Tome and Principe, particularly with the EU, UNDP, MCC, Portugal,
France, Spain and AfDB.

55.        Lessons learnt from Bank-wide analytical work on oil producing economies and
smallislandstates. STP has two characteristicsthat have been fairly well researched at the Bank.
The first characteristic is its oil activities which affect economic management and the governance
agenda." The experience shows that oil-abundant economies tend to perform poorly in three
wayslg: (a) they present lower long-term growth rates when compared to non-oil economies; (b)
their output as well as government revenue experience higher volatility due to fluctuating
commodity prices combined with undiversifiedrevenue and export bases; and (c) in spite o f their
resource wealth, a large number o f them are classified as severely indebted countries with high
levels o f external debt, making them vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations inducedby volatile
resource prices. Inaddition, there i s ample evidence that oil-induced growth i s hardly pro-poor
and that the arrival o f significant oil wealth can undermine already weak institutions creating a
vicious cycle. The two main areas o f focus o f the DPO, namely public resource and petroleum
sector management, coupled with strong implementation o f the PRSP help to reduce these risks.
Inaddition, the analysis to be carriedout inthe preparation ofthe new PRSP will also examine
STP's potential benefits from further regional or international integration. 2o

Accountability Review (PEMFAR) that undertook a comprehensive assessment o f S2o Tom6 and
Principe's public financial management systems and capacities, with the results presented to the
authorities in S2o Tom6 in March 2007. The Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) component o f the PEMFAR presented to the Government a set o f recommendations to
address key weaknesses in public sector management and accelerate reforms in the areas o f
budget preparation, execution, reporting and control. These recommendations were translated into
an action plan to be implemented over the next two years with the assistance o f the World Bank
Technical Assistance Capacity Building project. The recently completed Public Expenditure
Review (PER) component o f the PEMFAR highlightedthe need to improve the environment for
infrastructure services provision by strengthening the regulator, corporatizing SOEs, creating a
SOEs directorate within the Ministry o f Finance that take stock o f contingent liabilities o f SOEs
and adopting a policy to avoid building up arrears. This should be coupled with sector specific
strategies, revision o f the efficiency and targeting o f current implicit subsidies to SOEs and,
eventually, the introductiono f performance contract system. The priority however i s to strengthen

the data base in all forms or arrears in the SOE sector. The Country Procurement Assessment
Report (CPAR) component o f the PEMFAR presented a very weak procurement system in the
country, due mainly to the absence o f a modern procurement law and implementing regulations,
lack o fprocurement planning, weak procurement capacity incontracting entities, a narrow private
sector, and limited internal and external control mechanisms. The recommendations stemming
from this report are being incorporated by the Government in the drafting o f the procurement
regulations and the actionplan for implementationo f the procurement reformthat i s underway.

58.        DTIS. The Bank undertook a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) in 2006 that
highlighted the need to increase Foreign Direct Investment to diversify the economy out o f
traditional exports and eventual oil production, increase exports and foster growth. The study
noted that the main impediments to trade and investment in STP are not related to the country's
formal trade regime or trade agreements but rather the inadequate business environment and
infrastructure. The study also suggested passing new tax laws to simplify tax compliance and
eliminate tax discrimination o f foreign investment, streamlining the procedures for establishing
and operating a business, and improving infrastructure by allowing private participation in SOEs
coupled with better regulation.22


                              V.      THE PROPOSED GRANT OPERATION

                                        A.       OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

59.        Development Objectives. The proposed operation is designed to help implement the
Government's economic reform program during 2008-2009 that i s based on the country's PRSP
by supporting policy measures aimed at: (i)             improving accountability, effectiveness and the level
o f public resources; and (ii)        strengthening governance in the oil sector. In addition, the DPO will
support the government's plan to initiate preparation o f a new PRSP. The CAS proposes to
provide financial support through Development Policy Operations in support o f PRSP
implementation, with a view to preparing the ground for managing future oil revenues into the
budget. The three areas being supported by the DPO represent the key sectors in STP's economy
having direct impact on the country's level o f income, poverty and overall governance. The DPO
i s fully aligned with the PRSP objectives o f reforming public institutions, improving capacity,
promoting good governance, and accelerating and redistributing growth.




22 The trade system i s considered open, with no quantitative restrictions. Since 1998, STP has engaged in wide-ranging
trade liberalization such as the liberalization o f current account transactions in 1999, the elimination o f nontariff
barriers, and the liberalization o f the exchange rate regime. The obligation to surrender export receipts to the central
bank was abolished. The tariff schedule was reformed in2002 to allow for four bands spanning zero to 20 percent, with
some exemptions and surcharges. The government continues to implement a customs tariff reform in order to simplify
the tariff structure and increase transparency, compliance, and revenues. It i s pursuing gradual elimination o f remaining
customs exemptions, removing the central government import tariff exemptions in mid-2006. The nontariff barrier
linked to monopoly practices relates to imports, and distribution by state-owned enterprises has been removed
progressively with a partial privatization process. The last nontariff barrier protecting the domestic telecommunications
company expired at the end o f 2005.

60.      Benefits. This operation will raise the level, efficiency and effectiveness of existing
public spending to better deliver key services. This will be achieved by supporting government's
policy actions to (i)improve public expenditure efficiency through better budget preparation,
execution, and control; (ii)enhance the tax regimes and assure stronger impact o f public
expenditures on poverty; and (iii)   raise the standard o f petroleum sector governance in line with
international standards o f transparency and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI).Ultimately, the main benefits o fthis operation will accrue to all SBo Tomeans interms of
higher incomes, reduced poverty, and higher levels o f transparency and political and economic
stability.

61.      This operation will strengthenkey areas that will facilitate the implementation of a
new PRSP. This grant will accelerate the implementation o fthe current PRSP and help prepare a
new strategy that incorporates lessons learnt from the past experience and includes updated
information on petroleum sector and growth diversification prospects. The public finance
management focus will first enhance budget preparation and execution processes, thereby
strengthening the link between public expenditure, the objectives set forth in the PRSP, and the
links between sector strategies and corresponding program budgets. This will enhance the
capacity o f the country to better design and implement medium term strategies. Second, it will
help reinforce the fiduciary framework to produce public accounts and strengthen accountability
in public expenditure, procurement and financial management. Lastly, the DPO will help
strengthen the analytical base for a more forceful growth strategy consistent with oil sector
developments.

62.      Prior Actions. The full program o f actions to be supported by the proposed operation is
set out in the Policy Matrix (Annex 3).             The prior actions listed below assure early
implementation of policies needed to realize higher levels o f transparency and performance in
key areas. All along the implementation o f this operation, the government will need to maintain
satisfactory macroeconomic performance. Prior actions already completed by the Government are
presentedinBox 3.

64.      This section provides a discussion o f Silo Tom6 and Principe's medium-term reform
program around the issues o f focus in this DPO, namely (i)   improving accountability, efficiency
and the level o f public resources; and (ii)strengthening governance in the oil sector. These two
pillars are part o f the implementation agenda o f the Government's PRSP. In addition, the
authorities aim to initiate the preparation of a new PRSP based on the lessons learnt from the
implementation o f the current PRSP and incorporating a well researched growth diversification
strategy. The top strategic priorities are the reform of public institutions and promotion o f good
governance as well as acceleration o f redistributive growth. Several o f these actions are being
jointly supported under the IMF PRGF. Considerable progress has already been realized inthese
areas over the last few years and the Government's interest i s to accelerate implementation. Each
section includes a paragraph that summarizes the expected results, performance and monitoring
indicators, and pertinent quantitative benchmarks.



                                                 24

a.       Improving Accountability, Effectiveness and level of Public Resources

65.      The top priority of the government and this operation is to assure continued progress in
public finance management. Reform in this area i s recognized to be time consuming and
challenging for a small country at this level o f development and the immediate objective i s to
ensure that the ongoing process o f reform gathers stronger momentum. Budget management
reforms are already being implementedwith the support o f the World Bank through the Technical
Assistance Capacity Building Project started in 2004. The key objective o f this DPO i s to help
deepen the ongoingreforms inbudget management while launchingreforms in subsequent phases
such as treasury, accounting and procurement. Achievements and forthcoming actions supported
by this DPO are presentedbelow.

66.      Budget preparation and formulation improved in 2007 with the approval o f the
Organic Law on Public Finance Management (SAFE law) that replaced the outdated 1986 Public
Finance Management Organic Law. The biggest success under the new law i s that dual budgeting
o f current and investment expenditures has been eliminated. This was followed by the adoption o f
a new budget nomenclature in 2007, allowing a more homogenous and transparent recording o f
all financial transactions o f the State, and facilitating the analysis o f budgetary outcomes
according to internationally recognized standards. A chart o f accounts was approved in
September 2007 which will contribute to the production o f more reliable government accounts.
Still, implementation o f these reforms remains a challenge because o f lack o f consistency
between recurrent and investment expenditures that, in practice, still follow parallel budget
processes, weak correspondence between the budget and PRSP priorities, and a predominant role
o f the Ministry o f Planning and Budget with limited involvement o f sector ministries. Also, the
medium-term expenditure fkamework and multi-year sector allocations have not been integrated
into the process. Furthermore, the Budget i s persistently submitted with delays to the National
Assembly which i s not in a position to conduct a full review o f the draft proposal due to
insufficient time lead and few deputies with expertise in budgeting which further delays for
budget approval. No supplemental budget i s voted during the year. To improve budget
presentation, as a prior action to this operation, the Ministry o f Planning and Finance has
presented the 2008 Budget to the National Assembly in compliance with Article 23 o f the
Organic Law for Public Finance (SAFE Law 3/2007). This included inter-alia the following
additional information:

         a)    Government Program (Grandes Opq6es do Plano)
         b)    Preliminary execution o fthe 2007 Budget
         c)    A revenue forecast and expenditure limits
         d)    Sources o f funds for financing the 2008 Budget

         e)    List o f institutions coveredinthe 2008 Budget
         f)    A proposal of budget allocations for all institutions with administrative and
               financial autonomy and State Owned Enterprises

67.      In order to improve the budget planning process and facilitate the preparation and
supervision o f the up-coming PRSP, the Councilof Ministers issueda decreein May 2008 that
specified all budget codes that correspond to PRSP prioritiesin social sectors. These codes
will be used to produce quarterly execution reports o f pro-poor budget expenditures, facilitating
supervision o f the financial implementation of the PRSP. Furthermore, the Councilof Ministers
will issue a decree by September 2008 to adapt the Budget Directorate to the SAFE reform,
streamlining and clarifying its roles and functions.     With this the Budget Directorate will
concentrate on processes o f budget preparation and control, as the commitment and liquidation


                                                 25

functions are gradually transferred to sector ministries (with payments responsibility remaining
with the Treasury). In the medium term, the Government also plans to develop a module for
budget preparation within the SAFE-e system with appropriate training o f personnel at the
Budget Directorate and the Budget and Accounting Departments at the Sector Ministries (DAFs)
to take up budget expenditure functions foreseen inthe SAFE law.

68.      At the Budget execution level, the MoPF introduced in January 2007 a Computerized
Integrated Financial Management Information System, allowing information to be available from
the Budget Directorate (responsible for approving expenditure commitments and issuingpayment
orders) and the Treasury (responsible for actual payment and public accounting). However, the
scope o f the systemhas remained limited to the commitment and payment order sub-phase within
the MoPF. As a result it i s limited by four main deficiencies: (a) while commitments and
liquidation are fully computerized, the payment phase i s not as the Central Bank i s not linked to
the system; (b) the system does not produce public accounts; (c) sector ministries and
decentralised bodies are not yet included in the system; and (d) several Directorates o f the
Ministryo fPlanningandFinance (Debt, Planning, Tax and Customs administration) are also not
included. Budgetary procedures pertaining to investment expenditure in particular are
cumbersome although the computerized system has improved execution time and control.
Limited sector ministries' involvement inbudget execution increases the risk o f paying for goods
and services before they are provided. Current information on the execution o f foreign-financed
operations i s incomplete and recording i s delayed. To resolve these issues, the Government aims
to expand the existing system to a larger system, SAFE-e, that will be developed locally by a
team o f local information technology specialists who will help build local capacity and
experience inthe maintenance o f the system. A key element o f the new enlarged system i s that it
will be based on a web-based technology and equipment server structure that will reduce
maintenance.

69.      Accounting system. STP does not keep records in accordance with double-entry
accounting principles. Government accounts are managed with the sole objective o f respecting
budgetary ceilings and available financial resources. This rudimentary form of record keeping
undermines the use o f accrual techniques and prevents the construction o f reliable General
Government Accounts, which makes government macroeconomic and financial analyses more
difficult and, more importantly, hinders effective internal and external control. The Chart o f
Accounts approved in September 2007 adopts the double-entry accounting technique in line with
international standards. However, the Treasury Directorate does not have an accounting unit and
the government's accounting i s limited to the daily recording o f expenditures and revenues by the
Central Bank. In the absence o f a double-entry accounting system, it i s not possible to h o w the
government's financial position with sufficient certainty. Government accounts have yet to
integrate externally financed expenditures, controls on physical assets are weak and, despite
recent improvements, debt monitoring i s deficient. Since no government balance sheet i s
prepared, the Treasury only provides to the National Assembly and the "Tribunal de C ~ n t a s " ~ ~
information in terms o f payments inflows and outflows. Consequently, the closing balances for
the previous fiscal year are not carried forward into opening balances for the following fiscal
year.

70.      This DPO will support the government's plan to address these big issues. The first
step was the issuanceby the Council of Ministersof decrees in May 2008 creating a Public
Accounting Department and an Information Technology Department in the Ministry o f Planning
and Finance with appropriate budget and personnel allocations. These personnel will collaborate

                                                       26

in the development of the SAFE-e System, a fully integrated system that will assure that all
budgetary, financial and asset operations are recorded in government accounts, thus assuring the
production o f reliable and consistent information. Effective production o f public accounts will
await the development o f the SAFE-e system by December 2008. Simultaneously, the staff o f
these two departments will receive training in public accounting and subsequently in the use o f
the SAFE-e system. In addition, the Council of Ministers will issue a decree creating and
staffing (by end-June 2008) an autonomous Directorate of Government Asset Management,
with separate functions from the existing Treasury Directorate. Following this, the MoPF will
approve an action plan spelling out the strategy for the management o f government assets and
recruit by September 2008 a firm to carry out two essential tasks: (i)                carry out a survey o f all
government assets in each sector ministry to be completed by April 2009, and (ii)                          develop a
software programby December 2008 for the management o f Government Assets.

71.        Treasury. The current system o f cash management based on monthly appropriations is
not fully connected with the resource mobilization schedule. For budgetary programming
purposes, the Treasury uses the approved annual budget divided into monthly twelfths, which
makes treasury management quite rigid especially as some goods or services contracted are given
priority; this causes delays in the payment o f the rest o f goods and services, which are not
registered. The main risk i s that the officers authorizing payments do not have the resources
required to efficiently execute their budget, which generate either internal arrears or delays in
executing public expenditure. The practice o f paying for services before they are provided
presents serious risks. The current information on the execution o f foreign-financed operations i s
incomplete and requires setting up an information gathering system involving jointly the
government and development partners. As a first step inthe reform, the Treasury will carry out by
September 2008 an inventory o f the government's unsettled financial obligations as o f December
31,2007.

72.        To help avoid the recurrence o f similar problems inthe future, the plan i s to improve cash
management at the Treasury by adopting by July 2008 a new methodology for preparing financial
programs and cash plans, followed by the adoption o f new manuals for Treasury operations by
September 2008. This will be followed by a training program o f Treasury Directorate personnel
on the new operational manual by September 2008 and the adoption o f a financial programming
module into the SAFE-e system with a link to the Central Bank by March 2009. Inaddition, a
settlement plan for the unsettled financial obligations will be approved by November 2008.

73.        SOEs financial supervision. Controls remain weak, both internally and externally, and
do not appropriately cover State Owned Enterprises that formally fall under the financial
supervision o f the Treasury that, in practice, has no capacity for this task. Yet as described in
paragraph 16, SOEs represent a serious burden in STP's economy. In this context, the
government's first action i s to start the basic analytical work to fully assess the problems in the
sector and possible remedies.24 The InspecqSio Geral de Finanqas (IGF), will carry out by
September 2008 a diagnosis study o f the accounting procedures and financial status o f the four
fully owned state enterprises as o f December 31, 2007.                   The Treasury Directorate will be
associated to this exercise and shortly afterward will be given the authority to monitor the
financial situation o f all fully or partially owned state enterprises in STP as part o f a new
supervision system for State Enterprises that will involve the MoPF and line ministries.



24Other actions already taken by the GoSTP to improve SOEs financial position include the set up o f a pre-paid
electricity system by EMAE in 2007 as well as an overall 50 percent increase in water and electricity tariffs in August
2007.


                                                       27

74.      Procurement. The recently finalized Country Procurement Assessment Review presents
a very weak procurement system in STP, due mainly to the absence o f a modern procurement law
and implementing regulations, lack o f procurement planning, weak procurement capacity in
contracting entities, a narrow private sector, and limited internal and external control
mechanisms. Inthe context o f the World Bank Technical Assistance Project considerable amount
o f analytical work and consultations has already been carried out in preparation o f procurement
 regulation^.^' An international consultant to draft the new procurement regulation and standard
biddingdocuments was recruitedinOctober 2007. A first draft o fthe procurement regulationhas
been produced end last year. On the basis o f comments received by government agencies, a
reviseddraft was prepared inMarch 2008. The key next steps that will be supported by this Grant
are the issuance by the Council o f Ministers o f the decree on procurement regulation by October
2008, the issuance o f a decree to create the Procurement Supervisory Body by November 2008,
and the allocation o f adequate budget and staff to the Procurement Supervisory Body by
December 2008 as well as the design o f a training program on procurement for Government
procurement officers by February 2009. The impact o f these reforms i s expected to be very high
especially as the objective for the country i s to have modern procurement procedures alignedwith
the O E D C D A C methodology and allow the use o f the procurement regulation within Bank
financing under National Competitive Bidding.

75.      Strengthening Payroll Management. The technical process for managing payroll is
based on budget items. The collective payment order i s issued by the Budget Directorate using
special payroll management software, which contains a personnel database. However, databases
used by the Budget Directorate and the Ministry o f Justice and Public Administration are not
reconciled. Payment (mostly in cash) and control o f employees i s performed by the Financial
Management Directorates (DAF) at Sector Ministries, under the responsibility o f the Treasury
Directorate. The government i s developing a plan for merging the payroll database at the Ministry
o f Planning and Finance and the personnel records database at the Ministry o f Justice and Public
Administration. In its initial phase, the plan will include a general headcount of government
employees and the formulation o f a proposal to develop a robust personnelrecords database at the
Ministryo fJustice andPublic Administration.

76.      Strengthening the tax system. SZo Tom6 and Principe launched a review o f its tax
legislation in late 2006 to bring it in line with international standards. Following this review
efforts are being made to strengthen the two main tax regimes in the country and the Corporate
and Personal Income tax codes will be submitted to the National Assembly for approval. The two
draft laws have benefited from technical assistance from the IMF and seek to harmonize taxation
between enterprises and individuals, improve the rate structure, and strengthen tax assessment.
These reforms will help reduce distortions and increase revenue buoyancy over the medium term.
Given the importance o f these laws for the country the government has expedited their approval
inthe National Assembly as part ofthe prior actions for this DPO.

77.      Corporate incometax. Traditionally, the Tax Directorate has had difficulty inassessing
corporate taxes due to limited institutional capacity and broad informality in STP economy. To
simplify compliance procedures, the new Corporate Tax Code presented to the National
Assembly in April 2008 distinguishes between major contributors, often subsidiaries of foreign
companies, and small and medium size enterprises, also separated between those formally
registered and those in the informal sector. The Code aims, on the one hand, to expand the tax
base and improve and simplify corporate tax assessment and collection while limiting the

''The Organic Public FinanceManagementLaw (SAFE law) includesprovisions for procurement. The Governmentis
preparingregulationsonprocurementto make it operational.


                                                    28

associated disincentives for foreign investment, and, on the other hand, to gradually bring small
informal firms to the formal sector. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and
Portuguese technical assistance programs will help the government put in place the remaining
implementing regulations in 2008. They will also help to strengthen tax collection by improving
cooperation between different government directorates to effectively monitor all sources o f
corporate income. Finally, the corporate tax rates have been reduced from the current 30-
45 percent to a single rate o f 25 percent which i s closer to regional levels. This reduction in the
number and level o f the tax rate i s expected to increase the number o f contributors as shown by
past experience incustom duties inSTP.

78.      Personal income tax. Currently, only salaries are taxed at a single rate o f 13 percent,
withheld at source. The tax base i s very narrow as informality in the economy i s widespread. To
address this, the Personal Income Tax Code that has been submitted to the National Assembly in
April 2008 applies to all forms of income, therefore reducing economic distortions that penalize
the formal sector. Existingdistortions will be further reduced with the introduction o f progressive
tax rates that are more consistent with corporate tax rates. Lastly, it introduces exemptions for
payments such as scholarships or social security contributions both o f which have strong positive
impacts on human development.

79.      Urban Tax. Last but not least, the government will also pass a new Urban Tax Law in
the first half o f 2008. While this i s not considered as a prior action at this stage, the new law i s
expected to improve the overall framework o f taxation in STP and eventually increase revenues.
The current Urban Property Tax applies a 15 percent tax rate on any urban property with several
correction factors depending on the year o f property registration that reduces the total amount
actually paid. Legislation in the field i s cumbersome and difficult to apply as there i s no reliable
cadastre. Furthermore, companies set up in rural zones are excluded from this tax which may
impact on business location. This draft law will address these issues in order to frame a modem
urban property tax in line with international standards. The authorities also plan to strengthen the
cadastre in order to better supervise compliance o f the urban tax.

80.      Establishing a Tax Tribunal. The National Assembly approved in March 2007 the
General Tax Code and the Tax Procedural Code that modernize tax administration procedures
and create a specialized Tax Tribunal (Tribunal Tributirio Nacional) for resolving appeals and
enforcing collections.26However, the organic law that establishes the Tax Tribunal itself has not
yet been enacted, undermining the capacity o f the government to actually recover tax arrears. In
this context the government is committed to preparing a draft law for National Assembly
approval in July 2008 to establish the needed Tribunal. Coordination between the Ministry o f
Justice and Public Administration and the MoPF will be heightened over the next few months for
the preparation o f this law. Implementing regulations for the effective operation o f the Tax
Tribunal will be issued by December 2008. The Tribunal will be given financial and staff
resources to carry out its mandate in January 2009. The authorities also plan with M C C and
Portuguese support, to strengthen tax and customs administration, including stepping up efforts to
audit tax returns and increase tax arrear collection.

b.       Strengthening Governance in the Oil Sector

82.      STP has the potential to become a petroleum producing nation. Nigeria and SBo
TomC and Principe signed a Treaty in 2001 to establish a Joint Development Zone (JDZ) in an
area o f overlapping maritime boundary claims. The treaty set up the Joint Development Agency
(JDA) to jointly manage the exploitation o f the zone and granted 60 percent to Nigeria and 40
percent to SBo TomC and Principe o f the benefits and obligations arising from development
activities in the JDZ. In 2004, the JDZ undertook a Licensing Round and a consortium
comprising Chevron, Exxon Mobil and the Nigerian company Dangote Energy Equity Resources
paid a signature bonus o f U S $123 million for the right to sign a Production Sharing Contract and
explore Block 1. In a second licensinground three other blocks were awarded and their licensees
have also concluded Production Sharing Contracts: Sinopec (Block 2), Anadarko (Block 3) and
Addax (Block 4) are their main operators. In addition to these, there i s a contract with ERHC,
signed in 1997 giving extensive rights for oil exploration in STP's offshore waters for a very
modest price."       These rights have since been scaled back in two successive rounds o f
negotiations, but are still considered extremely generous, including pre-emption rights to blocks
2-6 in the JDZ and an exemption from paying any "signature bonus" on its entitlements. As a
consequence o f this prior rights agreement, STP has foregone U S $ 51.8 million in signature
bonus for blocks 2-4. SBo TomC and Principe also has its own Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
that may have the potential for considerable petroleum discoveries and i s developing its
legislation and strengthening its technical and economic capacity to launch a first biddinground
in2008.




27The contract with ERCHincludedprovisionsfor setting up ajoint venture oil companywith the government, holding
exclusive negotiations on behalf of STP's government, earning 5 percent royalty interest in government concessions
andgettingexemptionsfrom any duties andtaxes.

83.      Oil exploration. Results announced in May 2006 on exploratory drilling in Block 1 o f
the JDZ confirmed the existence o f oil resources in ultra-deep sea. However, these resources are
considered commercially not viable and no new exploratory drilling i s expected until 2008.
Further drilling could improve prospects o f commercial exploitation but, in any case, should a
commercial discovery takes place, production will start in 2014 at the earliest. Depending on the
size o f discovery and rate o f extraction, a well may produce for 15 to 25 years.

84.      Importanceof governancein the petroleum sector. The petroleum sector is the most
important sector in STP economy not only in terms o f future exports and economic growth but
also in terms o f its impact on the broader policy and governance agenda (see paragraph 55). To
address the concerns shown by the international experience o f oil producers in Africa and other
developing countries, the National Assembly approved the Oil Revenue Management Law
(ORML) in 2004. The law established an account - the National Oil Account - inwhich all oil
revenues are deposited directly, introducing specific mechanisms to restrict the amount o f such
revenues that can be used for annual budgetary expenditures. The calculation o f this amount i s
based on: (i) planned future revenues; and (ii)    domestic absorption capacity. The finite nature o f
oil resources i s also taken into account, as well as the need to introduce mechanisms that will
allow Siio Tom6 and Principe to face the post-petroleum era with minimum economic distress.
For that purpose, a reserve sub-account was established - the Permanent Fund o f S5o Tom6 and
Principe - in which part o f the oil revenues shall be deposited for future generations, and whose
use shall be strictly conditioned, except for the earnings generated from investments o f its funds.
To complement the Organic Revenue Management Law, the government set up the National
Petroleum Agency (NPA) and the National Assembly established in 2006 the Petroleum
Oversight Commission and in 2007 the Public Registration and Information Office to audit and
monitor oil revenue flows and disseminate oil related information.

85.      Since 2005, the NOA has being operating according to the ORML. Oil signatures
bonuses totaling US$77.8 million have been deposited inthe NOA since 2005 which inturn have
generated US$1.8 million interest earnings (Table 6). Drawings from the account to finance the
budget have totaled US$37.9 million until 2007. In addition the NOA has also financed the
delayed contributions to the JDA budget in 2005 and repayment o f advances to Nigeria in 2007,
totaling US$26.8 million. At the end o f 2007 the NOA balance was US$14.9 million and was
pending o f US$26.1 million oil bonuses for Blocks 5 and 6 to be disbursed in 2008. However,
legal controversies on these blocks may delay the bonus payment, quickly depleting the NOA. To
avoid this and in line with the ORML provisions the expected drawings from the NOA to finance
the 2008 budget will be reduced to US$3 million compared to US$8 million in2007 and US$15.6
million in2006.

86.         Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative implementation. The government has
committed to implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). For the
operations in the JDZ, the Abuja Declaration on oil supervision signed in 2004 by the Presidents
o f both countries proposes to align information and accounting practices o f the Joint
Development Authority (JDA) with best transparency standards. Notwithstanding the progress
shown on oil management transparency, the country i s still making efforts to fulfill the validation
conditions laid out by the EITI International Committee. In this context, the DPO has supported
as prior action the adoption by the national EITIcommittee inFebruary 2008 o f an action plan for
the implementation o f the EITI, later adopted by the Ministry o f Natural Resources and
Environment by resolution number 11/2008 on April 23, 2008. Following its completion, STP
has beenaccepted as a candidate country by the International EITI committee.

87.         Recent setbacks on petroleum governance. Given the risks o f setbacks in the
management of the petroleum sector (see paragraph 31) this Grant supports as a prior action the
submission by the Ministry o f Natural Resources and Finance to the National Assembly in May
2008 o f the draft Petroleum Sector Law (Fundamental Law on Petroleum Operations), and the
approval by the Council o f Ministers o f Decree 11/2008 on April, 30, 2008 assuring the use o f a
Model Contract for production sharing in oil sector concessions, in line with international
standards of transparency and competition. The Government will also publish in June 2008 the
Handbook o f Oil Management Law and adopt the PetroleumSector Development Strategy.

88.         The key objective for the medium term i s to assure strict implementation o f best
transparency practices under the EITI initiative both nationally and inthe joint STP-Nigeria zone.
Inpursuingthis objective, the Joint STP- Nigeria Committee will closely supervise transparency
issues pertaining to the Joint Development Zone and the national EITI committee will establish
close working relations and cross-representatives between the Petroleum Oversight Commission



                                                                   32

and the national EITI committee. At the same time the legal and regulatory principles for the
biddingo fthe EEZblocks will also follow competitive and transparent rules.

89.      Results. The main expected result in this area is the strengthening o f institutions
supervising oil revenue management in line with best international standards. This i s expected to
have a strong impact on both revenue mobilization and overall governance in STP, as the country
plans to initiate bidding in its Exclusive Economic Zone in 2008. Furthermore, it will foster
transparency in oil management within the JDZ shared with Nigeria in line with EITI practices.
The indicators to measure appropriate implementation of these reforms will be: (i)     publication o f
the first EITIreport by October 2008; (ii)   appropriate number o f qualified petroleum companies
expressing interest in the EEZ biddingprocess and; (iii)    publication o f the National Oil Account
balances.


                           VI. OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

                             A.       POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACT

90.      The proposed operation i s designed to help implement the Government's economic
reform program for 2008-2009 that i s based on S5o Tom6 and Principe's Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP). The reforms supported by the operation are expected to have likely and
significant poverty and social impacts. Tax reforms are expected to have a positive distributional
effect on the poor (see paragraph 92). Strengthened petroleum sector governance will have a
positive effect on petroleum revenues and provide a framework for their use that benefits all S5o
Tomeans. Public Finance Management reforms are expected to make public expenditure more
effective, transparent and in line with pro-poor objectives set inthe PRSP. Finally, the revision o f
the PRSP will revise the poverty reduction goals in line with the new macroeconomic and
petroleum framework and will foster a growth strategy that benefits the poor through more stable
employment and increasing income.

91.      Pro-poor public expenditure. Weak Public Financial Management has limited the
capacity o f the government to prepare, execute and report the national budget which has led to
inefficiency, limited control and loss o f impact o f limited public resources. This grant focuses on
improving public finance management in order to enhance public expenditure efficiency to
provide services that mainly benefit the poor. Also, Joint World Bank and IMF staff assessments
o f STP's PRSP have emphasized the need for the poverty strategy to be more explicit on key
priorities and budgetary allocations. Inpractice, the PRSP has not been used as the main policy
reference inthe preparation o f the nationalbudget, a situation further exacerbated by the lack o f a
functional classification that appropriately allowed for the recording o f pro-poor budget
expenditures. To resolve this and facilitate the preparation and supervision o f the up-coming
PRSP, the DPO will support the Ministry o f Planning and Finance plan to issue a decree that
maps-out the budget codes to PRSP priorities. These codes will in turn be used to produce
quarterly reports o f pro-poor budget execution, facilitating supervision o f the financial
implementation o f the PRSP.

92.      Distributionaleffect of tax reforms. The new income tax aims at increasing public
revenues to keep pace with needed social expenditure that benefits mostly the poor. It will do so
by (i)expanding the tax base to include more tax payers, eliminate most o f the exemptions and
include all sources o f income to calculate the tax base, and (ii)      introducing progressivity by
charging higher tax rates on higher incomes and exempt earners with low incomes. Exemptions to
the tax will also include payments to various forms o f social security. Accordingly, the burden o f



                                                 33

the income tax reform will fall mostly on the better-offpopulation and benefit the poorer. With
regardto the corporate tax the government aims at reducing the currently highcorporate tax rates
and simplifyingtax compliance to provide an incentive to formality that will promote more broad
basedeconomic growth and attract foreign direct investment.

93.       Electricity and Water tariff and subsidies. This operation is not expected to have a
direct impact on electricity and water tariff and subsidies. The Bank will support the Government
to carry out additional analytical work with special focus on the distributional effects o f any
further tariff increases. Past information shows that impact o f the 50 percent electricity and water
tariff increase in 2007 may have had a large impact on household expenditure.** IMF has agreed
on a new tariff structure that raises the Government's burden o f the tariff increase to compensate
for less that originally requestedtariff increase inpoorest households.

94.       The Government will support further analysis on electricity and water tariff and
subsidies and the impact on different stakeholders. After the electricity and water tariff
adjustments o f August 2007, the government has decided that fwther tariffs increases will take
place only after a deeper analysis o f their impact. An increase in tariffs could have a substantial
impact on poverty among households connected to the network and especially for the poorest
with a connection and may not be a socially acceptable option in the short to medium term. For
poverty reduction, the planned analysis will examine and evaluate options to minimize the impact
on the poor, including the level and structure o f tariffs, timing o f adjustments, and alternative
compensatory or mitigation measures. Also, the Government will evaluate the poverty impact o f
subsidies to EMAE and hence impact on tariffs, as well as alternative pro-poor public spending.
Reforms will be designed on the basis o f the above mentioned analysis and appropriate
representation o f all stakeholders including public consultations

95.       The Government plans to investin energy and water and sanitation sectors, two key
sectors for economic growth and human development. In the energy sector, the medium term
objective i s to develop public private partnerships to build new thermal and hydroelectric power
stations as well as initiate the development o f renewable energy production. Inthe meantime the
government i s prioritizing actions to improve EMAE's accounting and commercial systems
including an in depth review o f technical and financial inter-linkages between the four main state
enterprises.     Also, the 2008 Budget provides allocations to rehabilitate energy production
equipment to guarantee a minimumo f 12 MW additionalpower generation. Inthe same way, the
government i s planning to develop a national strategy together with an action plan for the water
and sanitation sector. This will be done in parallel with new investments aimed at extending
drinking water to the outskirts o f Silo Tome Capital, Agua Clara, Vadje Sum Pinho,
Canga/Cruzeiro, Praia Gamboa, Ribeira Peixe and Sundy and Abade inPrincipe. These plans are
being formulated with the view to facilitating discussions with donors for technical and financial
assistance.


                                    B.       ENVIRONMENTAL           ASPECTS

96.       The specific policies supported under the proposed grant address primarily institutional
reforms, and are not expected to have likely and significant effects on STP's environment,
forests, and other natural resources. However, there are possible environmental and natural

** Forthe poorest households with a connection, spending on electricityabsorbs morethan 5 percentof total spending,
which is considered to be slightly above the threshold of affordability in an average country for services such as
electricityor water.

resource consequences o f oil exploration and potential oil extraction. Reforms o f part o f the
institutional settings for oil exploration and exploitation are supported under this operation, but as
noted above primarily with a focus on financial transparency and good governance (including
EITI). Environmental aspects o f oil exploration and potential exploitation have been taken into
consideration through parallel technical assistance (including under a Bank-supported technical
assistance project) for the design o f the oil sector governance framework, and they reflect
international best practice.

                   C.      IMPLEMENTATION,      MONITORINGEVALUATION
                                                                AND

97.      Implementationministry.The ministryof Planning and Finance will be responsible for
overall implementation o f the proposed operation as well as for reporting progress and
coordinating actions among other concerned ministries and agencies.

98.      Need to improve the monitoringand evaluation system of the country. The Poverty
Monitoring Unit in charge o f monitoring and evaluating the implementation o f the PRSP has
limited administrative and technical capacity and lacks sufficient coordination with other
stakeholders, such us the Directorate o f Planning and the National Statistical Institute (INE).
Furthermore, it does not have adequate data on poverty indicators. The government plans to set
up the technical and advisory monitoring councils to foster coordination among different
institutions and departments, and the INE aims strengthen the information system for MDGs data
gathering in2007, with assistance from AFRISTAT.

99.      Program Monitoring. With a weak national monitoring system and a single tranche
operation, the review o f the program will be largely based on relevant and easy to monitor
indicators and the goals o f the program. A half-yearly review o f the program will be carried out.
Most o f the components o f the program will benefit from the monitoring system in place under
the TA project and the IMF PRGF. The operation will also strengthen the monitoring and
evaluation system to better monitor PRSP implementation.

                                    D.      FIDUCIARY    ASPECTS

100.     Public financialmanagement system. Public financial management issues are covered
as part o f the operation in section V, Improving Accountability, Effectiveness and level o f Public
resources, paragraphs 65 to 81. There are solid analytical underpinnings to this operation,
including a 2007 PEMFAR. STP's fiduciary framework i s adequate overall to receive the
proceeds o f the grant, particularly in light o f the implementation o f the PFM reform program
already underway which the Government i s committed to continuing with support from this
operation.

101.     Foreignexchange environment. Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the
Central Bank o f SZo Tom6 and Principe was subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect
to the PRGF arrangement approved on August 1, 2005. The assessment, which was completed on
August 2, 2004, found vulnerabilities inthe area o f financial reporting, internal audit and internal
control. Measures to strengthen the control framework and help safeguard Fund resources were
agreed with the authorities. Some recommendations have been implemented, including
contracting annual external audits, endorsing plans to modernize the Central Bank's internal audit
function, and adopting International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as the bank's
accounting framework. Although slow progress has been realized in the implementation o f IFRS




                                                 35

and recent annual audited financial statements have not been publicly available on a timely basis,
implementationo f these recommendations i s being monitored by Fundstaff.

                                       E.        DISBURSEMENT

102.     A single-tranche of SDR 3.7 million (US%6 million equivalent) will be disbursed
upon grant effectiveness and following the Recipient's request for withdrawal of proceeds
of the grant. The proposed grant will follow the Bank's standard disbursement procedures for
development policy operations. The grant will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation
o f the development policy program and not tied to any specific purchases. Once the operation is
approved by the Board and becomes effective, and following the Recipient's request for
withdrawal o f proceeds o f the grant, the Bank will disburse the proceeds o f the grant to a foreign
currency account maintained at the Central Bank o f SBo Tom6 and Principe and forming part o f
the official reserves o f SBo Tom6 and Principe. The Recipient shall provide confirmation to the
Bank that upon deposit o f the grant into said account, an amount equivalent to the grant proceeds
from the Bank has been credited in the Recipient's budget management system, with an
indication o f the exchange rate applied, where applicable. The conversion from the foreign
currency to the local currency will be based on the prevailing exchange rate on the date that the
funds are credited to the budget management system. The Central Bank o f Siio Tom6 and
Principe will not impose any charges or commissions on the Recipient for these transactions.

103.     Ifthe proceeds of the grant are used for ineligiblepurposes as defined inthe Financing
Agreement, IDA will require the Recipient to, promptly upon notice from IDA, refund an amount
equal to the amount o f said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request
shall be cancelled. The administration o f this grant will be the responsibility o f the Ministry o f

104.     The first risk i s the economy's vulnerability to external factors such as increasing
international oil prices or shortfall in donor support. This could have a deterring impact on
economic growth, reduce government resources and affect its ability to conduct its reform
program. The government has shown its commitment to keeping macroeconomic stability by
passing through increasing international oil prices to consumers and raising electricity and water
tariffs by 40-60 percent inSeptember 2007.

105.     The second risk i s that the reformprogram supported by the DPO could falter as a result
o f policy reversals and/or slippages in key reforms, notably on petroleum governance, which
could affect the Government's ability to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment and focus
expenditure on poverty reducing priorities identified in the PRSP. There i s a broad consensus
among all political parties on the need to advance economic reforms and maintain
macroeconomic stability. In fact, very important laws were passed even when the Government
party had no absolute majority in the National Assembly. This risk i s further mitigated now that
the new Government has majority inthe NationalAssembly.

106.     The third major risk i s weak institutional capacity. Despite some achievements in terms
o f building up capacity in the National Petroleum Agency and the Ministry of Planning and
Finance, major constraints to the implementation o f reforms remain due to weak institutional
capacity to prepare and implement reforms. The Technical Assistance Capacity Buildingwhich
has been implemented with success over the last three years as well as the various technical
assistance programs from the M C C and bilateral donors help alleviate this deficit.

107.     The fourth risk i s fiduciary. Despite the Government's continued efforts to reinforce
public finance management, some fiduciary risks with regardto the use o fpublic funds remain as
internal and external control mechanisms are weak. The DPO contains measures to strengthen
control mechanisms and improve accountability through more transparent processes as well as
strengthened internal and external controls. Also, the risks associated with enforcement,
institutional capacity and weak governance tied up to procurement are mitigated by the focus on
procurement reformin design and content o f the operation.

108.     The fifth risk i s the derailment o f macroeconomic stability if oil exploitation or the
payment o f the 2008 oil bonus does not materialize or excessive social demands arise if oil
exploitation i s confirmed. New drillings foreseen in 2008 will provide new information about the
potential exploitation o f oil in STP as well as on the timing. If these drillings prove to be less
successful than expected or the oil bonus outlay expected in 2008 does not materialize the fiscal
stance may be affected inthe short run.Alternatively, ifthe drillings are successful an increase in
social demands may arise, also straining macroeconomic stability. To anticipate this, the
authorities have committed to macroeconomic stability with initial dialogue to prepare a new
IMF-PRGF for 2008-10 and have initiated a public information campaign to temper oil
expectations.

                      POVERTY    REDUCTIONSTRATEGY PAPER(PRSP)
I. TheGovernment'sreferencedocumentisthe PovertyReductionStrategyPaper(PRSP)
adopted in 2003 after an extensive consultativeprocess with stakeholders. Since its adoption,
substantial progress has been made in developingthe processes and policies to ensure effective
implementationof the strategy. A PRSP unit was set up in2004 in the Ministry of Planningand
Financeto coordinate andensurethe implementationandmonitoringo fthe PRSP. Two extensive
national progress reportswere produced in 2006 and 2007 that were submittedto IDA and IMF
Executive Boards and received extensive comments through their Joint Staff Advisory Notes
(JSAN). These reports showed that notable progress has been made in social sectors, with
considerable improvements in education and health. For example, the 2006 PRSP status report
notes remarkably good performance of overall enrolment of both girls and boys at. primary
education level, andgains in addressinginfant mortality, under-fivemortality, andmalaria.
2.       The Government of the DemocraticRepublicof SHo Tom6 and Pn`ncipe also organized
in Sa0 Tom6 in December 2006 sector round tables on Governance, Infrastructureand Education
to foster the dialogue with international donors on sector policies and mobilize financial and
technicalassistanceto the PriorityActionPlan(PAP) ofthe Government.
3.       The PRSP is centered on five principal axes: (i)reform of public institutions, capacity
building, and promotion of good governance; (ii) accelerated and redistributive growth; (iii)
creation of opportunities to increase and diversify income for the poor; (iv) human resource
development and access to basic social services; and (v) adoption of mechanisms to monitor,
assess and update the strategy. These goals have been translated into a medium-termreform
program(Priority ActionPlan) for theperiod 2006 to 2008 inorder to maintainaminimumGDP
growthrate of 5 percent, halvepovertyby 2010, and further to 113 by 2015; providefull access to
basic services by 2015 and help improve quality of life of the population, reduce social and
gender disparitiesbetweendistrictsin SiIo Tom6 and between these and the AutonomousRegion
of F'rlncipe, as well as betweenurbanand mal populations, and promoteand build institutional
capacity and apolicyofgoodgovernance.
4.       The proposed economic and social reform program for 2008-2010 presented to the
NationalAssembly in April 2008 lies within this PRSP strategy and the mediumterm strategy of
the Government as described in the "Grandes Opgdes do Plano". It aims at reforming public
institutions,strengtheningcapacity andpromotinggood governance inaway to accelerate growth
in order to create opportunitiesto increase and diversify income for the poor. It will also aim at
improvinghuman resource development and access to basic social services with more efficient
provisionof public services. The complete set of reforms being supported by this Development
PolicyOperationis describedinthe attachedpolicy matrix.
5.       Finally, our authoritiesplan to up-date the PRSP basedon recommendationsreceived in
the 2007 JSAN and our implementation experience. There are four key needs that will be
addressed by the new PRSP. First is the need to raise the level of economic growth and
employment creation. Second is the costing of the strategy itself. Third is the update of the
povertyprofile and establishinga close
the strengtheningofthe monitoringand

new PRSP will be formulated in a participatory manner and we aim to incorporatea new growth
diversification strategy which will take into account updated information on petroleum
prospects.The Government is committed to strengthenthe reform agendafocusing on removing
bottlenecks to growth in the economy, particularly in agriculture, energy, infrastructure and
private sector development. The Poverty Observatory within the Ministry o f Planning and
Financehasbeengiven the official mandate to launchpreparationofthe second PRSP.

                      MACROECONOMICAND BUDGETARYFRAMEWORK
6.       The assumptions underlying the 2008 budget rely on the 2008 and 2009 economic
forecast agreed with the IMF as part o f the three-year PRGF arrangement that our Government
hassuccessfully implementedbetween2006 and 2008. Furthermore,our Governmentis confident
of reachinga new three-year agreement with the IMF in 2008 thus assuring continued assistance
and advicefrom Ih4F staff in the design of sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms.
These will aim not only at acceleratinggrowth and reducing poverty but also at spreading out
practicesofgoodgovernance.
7.       The economy performed well between 2005 and 2007, with a GDP growth of around 6
percent, despite the persistent increasein fuel and food prices in world markets.The sectors that
have shown strong growth include construction and tourism, mostly fueled by foreign direct
investment (FDI). Total investmenthas beenaround 35 percent' of GDP these last years with half
of it canied out by the private sector. We aim to maintain this growth momentum in the coming
years due to: (i)continued foreign investment in construction, tourism and the petroleum sector,
(ii)continuedengagementofdonors (iii)new sourcesofgrowth, particularly intheagriculture
sector, that will be promoted, and (iv) the continuation of public finance reforms, which will
ensure greater impact of public expenditureespecially on infrastructure andhumandevelopment.
8.       The primary fiscal deficit has been reduced from 10.1 percent of GDP in 2005 to 8.1
percent of GDP in 2007 with a further reductionto 5.2 percentofGDP expectedin2008. This has
been achievedwhile preservingpro-poor expenditures in the social sectors and implementing the
PRSP. On the revenue front, tax revenue forecasts for 2008 are based on a downward revision of
2007 levels due to a lowering of tax rates for the new personal income and corporatetax laws
scheduled for approval by the National Assembly before May 30, 2008. We are confident that
these new tau codes will increasethe tax base and tax revenues in the coming years as well as
foster FDIand private sector development by eliminating key tax inefficiencies.
9.       Our Government is aware that realizing fiscal consolidation will also depend on a
strengthening o f the SOE sector which currently suffers from weak finances. Insufficient
investment and operation and maintenanceexpenditures over the years have led to irregular and
poor service delivery and payment arrears to suppliers, which represent contingent liabilities for
the Government.Reforms inthis sector, plannedto start in 2009, will be guidedby the findings of
a study that will provide an update of estimated direct and indirect subsidies in the sector as well
as their poverty and social impact. Our Government will also prepare an action plan to improve
governance and supervision capacity in the sector in addition to proposing an appropriatetariff
structure that would allow the Electricity and Water and Sanitation Company (EMAE) to break-
even.
IO.      As with other small islandeconomieswe have a high dependence on importedgoods but
we are confident that even at current international price levels we will be able to finance our
current accountdeficit thanks to continuedhigh levelsofFDI. Gross international reserves, which
rose to the equivalent of 4.7 months o f imports of goods and services at end of December 2007,
will remain above 4 months equivalent in 2008 despite the spike, in international prices

and petroleum.These internationalpriceincreasestogether with the continued depreciationofthe
localcurrency (10 percentin2007) haveexertedupwardpressureon inflation, which at end 2007
was 27.6 percent (around10percent excludingfoodand energy prices).We are confidentthat the
inflationrate will comedown in 2008, owingprimarily to stringentmonetary andfiscal policies.
 11.     These achievements notwithstanding Silo Tom6 and Principe's economy remains
vulnerable due to its high level of debt relative to exports, dependence on foreign aid, and the
relatively narrow export base. In this context our Governmentintends to continuethe policy of
limitingexternal borrowingto concessional loans andgrants, no accumulationofexternal arrears,
and assuring the most efficient management of petroleum resources. The growth diversification
strategy will also aim to reduce import dependency and expandthe narrow base in the medium
term.
                        STRUCTURALREFORMSANDPRIOR ACTIONS
12.      The prior actions aim to assure an early and forcefbl start in the implementationof the
key components of the 2008-09 reform program. They focus primarily on public finance
managementand petroleum sector governancegiventheir importanceinrealizingthe overarching
objectivesofour program, i.e. economic growth and povertyreductionas well as governanceand
institutional enhancements. Reforms in these two sectors, launched several years ago, have
already demonstrated positive impacts on economic growth in STP. We plan to continue these
reformsover the nextfew years.
13.      IMPROVING ACCOUNTABILITY AND EFFICENCY OF PUBLIC RESOURCES. The prior
actionsin this area primarily address the problemsencountered in the preparation of the budget.
They have improvedtransparency in the preparation and presentation of the Budget law in line
with the Public Finance Management Law (SAFE Law) approved in 2007. Transparency is
ensuredthrough the presentationof extensivedocumentationthat complementsthe 2008 Budget
appropriations.Also, new budget codes inline with internationalstandardsapproved in February
2007 will facilitate implementation and monitoring of the different components of the 2008
Budget, including pro-poor expenditure, bringing additional accountability to the Government
with regard to budgetimplementation.To improvefurther our budgetmanagement, in particular
the reporting of financial operations in a transparent way, we have approved an accounting
systemfor public accounts and established two new departments within the Ministry of Planning
and Finance: (i)a Public Accounting Department that will facilitate the preparationof State
Accounts in line with international standards startinggradually in 2009; and (ii)an Information
Technology Department that will create and maintain a Computerized Integrated Financial
Management Information System (SAFE*),           allowing budget preparation, execution and
productionof public accounts in a unifiedand integratedway. This new informationsystemwill
build on a locally developedIntegratedFinancial Management InformationSystem linking the
Budget and Treasury Directorates and allowing for implementation and control of the
commitmentandpaymentordersub-phases.
14.      The Government is continuing the reform of the entire tax and customs legislation
initiated in 2006. A new corporate tax code and a new personal income tax code have been
drafted with assistance From international donors and have been submitted to the National
Assembly for approval. They have been both approved in a first reading by the National
Assembly. Both laws will bringtax rates in line with other African countries. We are confident
that the initial revenue loss in 2008 will be more than offset by the broadening of the tax base
thereafter. More importantly, the new tax laws will enhance progressivity and reduce
inefficienciesthat hinderprivatesector development.
15.      Preparing a new PRSP. As discussed in paragraph 5, the Government is
committedto the formulation and implementationof a new PRSP that will address the

challenges of STP more adequately. It is in this context that the Council of Ministers has
designatedthe Poverty Observatory(Observat6rio da Pobreza) to initiate the preparationof a new
PRSP. The priority for the Poverty Observatoryis to prepareby October 2008 an actionplanthat
will spell out the details of activities to be carried out during the preparatory period and their
timeframe, as well as a list ofthe technicalassistance needs. The AfDB and UNDP have already
committed to assisting us in carryingout some of these activities. We plan to request technical
assistance from IDA in the update of the poverty profile and the definition of the growth
diversificationstrategy.
16.      STRENGTHENING GOVERNANCE IN THE OIL SECTOR. The Government O f STP has
been implementinga multi-year program of governance strengthening in the oil sector over the
last fiveyears with assistancefrom IDA. A major milestonewas the approval ofthe Oil Revenue
ManagementLaw by the NationalAssembly in 2004. The law establishedaNationalOil Account
in order to ensure transparent and accountable management of revenues by the National
Assembly. Implementationof the law has beenbuttressedby official commitmentsto implement
the ExtractiveIndustriesTransparency Initiative(EITI) and the Abuja Declarationfor supervision
of the Joint DevelopmentZone that SHo Tom6 and Prlncipeshares with Nigeria. Inthis context,
the National Assembly has already passed legislation setting up the Petroleum Oversight
Committee and the Public Registrationand InformationOffice to audit and monitor oil revenue
flows anddisseminate oil relatedinformation.
17.      As a continuation of this reform, the Government has submitted new petroleum sector
legislationto the National Assembly on May 6,2008 andthe Council ofMinistershas issuedthe
decree for a modelcontract onApril 30, 2008. This key legislationwill allow the Governmentto
initiate the bidding of petroleum blocks in our Exclusive Economic waters by December 31,
2008. In this context of promotion of good governance, our Government is encouraged by our
success in beingaccepted in FebruaryZOO8 as acandidate country into the EITIprocess. As part
of the acceptanceprocess the National EITI Committee has adopted and publisheda work plan
for implementing the EITI, which has already been approved by the International EITI
Committee. The first National EITI report is expected to be completed within the next twelve
months.      ,

                                         FUTUREACTIONS
18.      The Governmentof the DemocraticRepublicof SHo Tom6 and Principeis committedto
continuingits reforms as described inour mediumterm strategy for 2008-10(Grandes Opq8es do
Plano ZOOS-IO).  The overarchingobjective of this strategy is to facilitate investment allocations
to enhance pro-poorgrowth especially throughimproveddomestic productionof food to alleviate
the chronic external deficit.To this endthe mediumtermstrategywill focus onthe following four
components: (i) strengthen the role of the State; (ii) fight poverty and promote sustainable
development; (iii)enhance the participationof the State in international relationships; and (iv)
improvesocial communication.
19.      Government efficiency and improved governance in managing public and natural
resources in line with best international practices o f transparency and accountability are at the
core of the mediumterm strategy, as illustratedby the attached matrix. In other words we aim at
economic governance quality and financial transparency which guarantee: (i) the efficient use of
public funds, (ii)adequate levels of domesticpublicrevenues, (iii) successful and comprehensive
execution of the economic and social program, (iv) the beginningof successful and transparent
operations in our exclusive economic zone, and (v) the successful implementationof the EITI
(see Grandes Opp8es do Plano, page 33).
20.      The key next steps to the prior actions are the implementationof a second round of
structural reforms over 2008-09 that encompasses not only further reformsin the public finances\ 3

and petroleum sectors but also sectors such as State Enterprises, structure of the State, human
resourcemanagement,employment, health, education, etc.
21.      Our Governmentis committedto ensuringadequateparticipationin the preparationof a
new PRSP which will provide a diversificationstrategy to better fight poverty and prepare the
country for potential petroleum revenues. The new PRSP will also revise the costing of the
strategy to attainthe MillenniumDevelopmentGoals andwill up-date the povertyprofile.We are
confident that a new PRSP built on the lessons learnt from the implementationof the current
PRSP and incorporatingupdated growth, petroleum, poverty and costing information will be
concluded by September 30, 2009. The co-ordination and harmonization of the actions of
development partners around these priorities will be also pursued for a complete and efficient
mobilizationofthe limitedpublicresources.
22.      As regards the medium-term macroeconomic and budgetary framework, we aim to
maintain good economic and budgetary performance, increase tax revenues which is
indispensableto assure higher levels of development and poverty reductionexpenditures, align
PRSPpriorities closer to the budget, as well as preparethe 2009 Budget basedon reliable socio-
economic data. Furthermore, we intendto limit foreignborrowingto those onconcessionalterms.
23.      While prior actions in public finance management focus on better preparation and
documentation of the budget to improve transparency and accountability, the second rohd of
reforms will aim at improvingbudget execution and control. The most prominentaspects of the
reforms will be comprehensivepublic accounting; recordingand management of all Government
assets; the mobilization of revenue through the creation of a tax tribunal to improve tax
collections; and improved management of public enterprises through the reorganizationof the
financialrelationsbetween the Stateandthe four fully owned State Enterprises.
24.      A very important iteminour medium term progTamof public finance strengtheningis the
setting up of a modem procurement system to enhance efficiency of our limited public
resources.To this end and with assistanceof the World Bank we will cany out the set of actions
described in the attached operation policy matrix. This will include in particular approval of a
decree on procurementregulation; adoption of standard procurement documents and evaluation
reports; creation of a ProcurementSupervisoryBody with adequate financialallocationsand staff
included in the 2009 Budget in order to start functioning by January 1, 2009. This will be
complemented by the design of a training program on procurement for all Government
procurementofficersby February28,2009, which will be subsequently providedto all staffof all
institutionsdealingwith procurement.
25.      Our budget preparationsystem will benefit from the streamliningof the functions of the
BudgetDirectorateby September 30, 2008 which will be followed by trainingof our accounting
and financial personnel in sector ministriesto take up budget expenditurefunctions foreseen in
the SAFE law. Inparallel,we planto developandtrainour personnel inthe useof anew software
for budgetary programmingincludingthe investmentbudget in2009.
26.      As a first step in improving financial management, the Ministry of Planning and
Finance plansto carry out by September30,2008 an inventoryof Governmentunsettled financial
obligationsof the Treasury as of December, 2007 andasettlementplanfor theseobligations will
be formulated by end 2008. Also, our InspecpHo Geral de Finanqas (IGF), jointly with the
Treasury, will carry out by September 30, 2008 a diagnosis study of the accountingprocedures
and financial status as of December 2007 of the four fully owned State Enterprises. Both these
analyses will provide our Government with an updated picture of the financial position of the
State. Based on these reports, we will approve a new supervisionsystem for State Enterprises.
With regard to Treasury operations, we will adopt a new methodology for preparing financial
programs and cash plans as well new manuals for Treasury operation that will be subseflt\y+

integrated intothe SAFE-e system and appropriately linked to the CentralBank. We also aim at
improving our payroll management system starting with approval of a plan for merging the
payroll database at the Ministry of Planningand Finance and the personnel records database at
the Ministryof Justice and Public Administration, includinga generalheadcount of Government
employees. This will be a first step towards the reform of our Human Resource Management
System.
27.      Inparallelwith these improvementsinaccountingandmonitoringoffinancialoperations,
our programincludes the establishment of a separateAssets Management Departmentwithin the
Ministry of Planningand Finance by June 30, 2008. A complete databaseof State assets by line
ministries will be availableby April 30, 2009, after the completionof an initial survey scheduled
for completionby March31,2009.
28.      In regardto taxation we plan to develop regulations for the implementationof the three
tax laws submitted to the National Assembly in April 2008. This will be accompanied by
programs to raise the capacity of the Tax and Customs Directorate to supervise and control
corporate and income tax implementationas well as the development of a cadastre. We will
benefit from MCC and Portuguese assistance in the implementationof these activities over the
nextthree years.
29.      The mediumterm programinthe petroleumsector aims to develop the basic legislation
for commercial exploitation of our Exclusive Economic Zone, and to ensure management of
petroleum revenues consistent with the EITI. Two sector laws were submittedto the National
Assembly on May 6,2008. They are: (i) the Fundamental Law on PetroleumOperations; and(ii)
the Petroleum Taxation Law. These will be complemented by a Decree from the Council of
Ministers, approved on April 30, 2008, assuring the use of a Model Contract for production
sharing inoil sector concessions. Both ofthese laws, as well as the model contract, drafted with
assistance of the World Bank, are in line with international standards of transparency and
competitionand will facilitatethe participationof reputableinternationalpetroleumcompanies in
the explorationand exploitation of our Exclusive Economic Zone. As a result these laws will
expand the scope of our governance effons beyond the limits of oil revenue management to
includethe management of explorationand exploitationcontracts. We also planto nominate by

cross-representatives betweenthe PetroleumOversight Commissionestablishedby the National
Assembly in 2006 andthe NationalEITICommittee.At the internationallevel we will approve a

                                     EXPECTED   OUTCOMES
31.      Our program of public resource management - financial as well as petroleum        - will
achieve noticeableimprovementsin governancein generaland intransparency,particularlyinthe
petroleum sector. The most visible outcome of this program is expected to be a strong
improvement in public finance management, not only in terms of budget processes or taxation
level, but also interms of expenditureimpact. We attach particular importanceto the preparation
of anew PUPthat will guideour strategy in the comingyears and providethe elements for pro-
poor growth. At the level of petroleumsector governance, the petroleumsector laws and

contract as well as the relatedreformsinthe sector will provide the basic elementsto successfully
initiate the process of exploration in the Exclusive Economic Zone, which could have a very
positive impact in terms o f public resources and growth. These laws and model contract will
facilitate the attraction of quality international companies. Participation in the EITI process will
help assure high levels of transparency not only as regards budgetary resources but also in terms
of contract negotiation.
32.      Responsibility for the implementation, coordination and monitoring of the overall
program will rest with the Ministry o f Planning and Finance, namely the Budget Directorate,
which will be assisted by the various technical Directorates such as Treasury, Planning,
Administrative and Financial, etc. Assistance will also be provided by the Ministry of Natural
Resources and Environment, the Poverty Observatory and the recently formed National EITI
Committee. The reform also foresees the creation of new structures within the Ministry of
PlanningandFinance, such as a Public Accounting Department, a Procurement SupervisoryBody
and aDepartment ofPublic Assets Management.

                                            CONCLUSlON
33.      The Government of the Democratic Republic of Slo Tom6 and Principe is seizing this
opporhmity to reiterate its commitment to the efficient executionof the program described in the
present DevelopmentPolicy Documentfor the next 12 months. It is convinced that the efficient
and satisfactory execution of this programwill contributetowards boosting the national economy
onto a healthy and sustainable basis in view of poverty reduction.              In the light of the
macroeconomic reforms already carried out, the fixed objectives in this program and the results
achieved during the previous years which are very encouraging, the Government of the
Democratic Republic of S o Tome and Principe requests the favorable consideration of its
financing request of May 5, 2008 aimed at the approval of a Grant of approximately US$ 6
million for the developmentof public and natural resource management in line with our PRSP
objectives andthe provisiono fsignificant budgetary support for financing our economy.

based on Siio Tom6 and Principe's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This reform program
was initiatedin 2003 with the approval of the PRSP and its subsequent implementation, as shown in
the 2005 and2006 Annual ProgressReportsofthe PovertyReductionStrategysent to the World Bank
andthe IMF.Notwithstandingthe hardshipsof the current external environmentand the handicapsof
small island economies, macroeconomicdisciplinehas been in line with the objectives agreed under
the I M F ' s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) that we have implementedbetween2006
and 2008. Thanks to these and other achievements SHo Tom6 and Principereached the Completion

2.       The Grant requestedby us, inthe form ofasingletranche supporttowardsthe strengtheningof
public and natural resource management in line with the PRSP objectives, will contribute towards
advances in two key areas of the SHo Tome and Principe economy: (i)improved public resource
management through better budget processes and enhanced tax legislation in order to raisethe level
and impact of public expenditures on poverty; and (ii)continued improvements in the standard of
petroleumsector governance in line with the ExtractiveIndustriesTransparencyInitiative(EITI).
3.       The funds made available by your institutionwill provide necessary financbg to support key
public expendituresin 2008. The budgettargets and prioritiesfor this year have beenagreed with the
IMFas part ofthe triennialprogram supported by the PRGF. Budgetpresentationanddocumentation

This operation will enable us to deepen the reforms in public finance management that are already
underway with support 6om the World Bank Technical Assistance Capacity Building Project
(TACBP). The key objective of the current program is to develop the institutions and capacities to
fully implement the Public Finance Management Law, particularly in relation to the integrated
financial system, and strengthen procurement. Three tax laws are also being overhauled to improve
publicfinances andpromoteinvestments.
         4.      As regards petroleum sector governance, our priority is to modernize the legal
framework for commercial exploitationof our Exclusive Economic Zone. The petroleumsector is the
most important sector of our economy in terms of potentialeconomic growth as well as its impacton

IMFExecutiveBoardCompletesFifthReviewofSgo Tom6 andPrincipe'sPRGFArrangement and
Approves PRGFandHIPCTopping-Up AssistanceDisbursements
Press Release No. 07/306
December 21,2007


The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fifth review o f SBo
Tom6 and Principe's economic performance under a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) arrangement and the review o f assurances for the disbursement o f the Fund's share o f topping-up
under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The completion o f the PRGF review
enables the release o f an amount equivalent to SDR 422,000 (about US$700,000), which would bring total
disbursementsunder the PRGF arrangement to SDR 2.5 million (about US$4 million).
The three-year arrangement was approved on August 1, 2005 (see Press Release No. 05/187), for a total
amount o f SDR 2.96 million (about US$4.6 million) to support the government's economic program for
2005-08.
Incompleting the review, the Executive Board approved a waiver of the nonobservance of an end-June
2007 structural performance criterion related to the issuance o f prudential regulations, based on remedial
measures taken by the authorities.
Inaddition, theExecutive Boardapprovedthe disbursementoftopping-up HIPCassistance ofSDR824,000
(equivalent to US$1.2 million). Together with accrued interest, the total disbursement to SBo Tom6 and
Principe amounts to SDR 868,000 (about US$1.4 million).
Incommentingonthe ExecutiveBoard's discussion on SBo Tom6 andPrincipe, Mr.MuriloPortugal, First
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
"SBo Tom6 and Principe's recent economic performance has been encouraging. Real GDP growth has
remained robust in 2007, inflation fell significantly, the domestic primary fiscal deficit was reduced, and
international reserves have exceeded the targets under the PRGF-supported program.
"The authorities are committed to consolidate the stabilization gains and safeguard fiscal sustainability.
They will continue to strengthen policy implementation and improve public financial management. In
particular, it will be necessary to contain personnel costs and non-priority expenditure to make room for
increased poverty-related spending while reducing the primary fiscal deficit. The central bank i s committed
to implementing a proactive monetary policy to manage liquidity growth and counter inflationary pressures
stemming from the rising oil import costs. Continued fiscal adjustment will further support the reduction o f
inflation.
"Intensified structural reforms will aim at achieving sustained private sector-led growth and improving the
investment climate, in particular by reducing administrative costs and delays in starting a business. The
authorities also need to press ahead with plans to reform the financial sector and enhance the institutional
framework for transparent management o f oil exploration and receipts.
"Inview o fthe uncertain oilprospects, it will be important to continue to pursueprudent fiscal and external
financing strategies so as to maintain debt sustainability over the medium term. The authorities are
committed to strengthening debt management and refraining from external borrowing on nonconcessional
terms," Mr.Portugal said.
