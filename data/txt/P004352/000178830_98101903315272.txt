APPRAISAL OF PORT PROJECT
SUMHARY A\ID CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project to improve three of the main
public seaports in the Territory of Papua New Guinea (PNG) - Port Moresby,
Lae and Kieta - and construct a new port at Alotau to replace old facilities
on an off-shore island at Samarai. The project also includes some equip-
ment and a training program for port accounting staff. The total cost is
estimated at US$11.1 million equivalent, of which costs to be incurred
outside PNG (off-shore costs 1/) are est3.rnated at US$9.2 million equivalent
and will be financed by the proposed IDA credit.
ii.       The project originated with a UNDP-financed and Bank-supervised
Transport '3urvey. It will cover most of the firm major port items in the
PNG Administration's investment program for the period 1971/72-1975/76
(based on the Survey), except for expansion of the port of Nadang, the
justification for which must await a decision on construction of a new
access road from Madang to the interior Highlands to tap a large developing
area. Feasibility st0ies of this road are scheduled to be comapleted soon.
Further investmelits are planned for Port Moresby and Lae extending into
the later 1970's but these will depend on traffic developments and further
studies.
iii.      The Conmonwealth of Australia will guarantee the credit on behalf
of PNG (Borrower) which Australia administers. This credit will be the
first Bank Group lending operation for ports in PNG. In June 1970, the
Bank and the Association jointly provided US$9 million for a highways
project (Loan 693/Credit 204-PNG).
iv.       The Papua New Guinea Harbours Board (PNGHB), which will be the
beneficiary, assumed operational responsibility for the principal ports
in July 1967 and financial responsibility on January 1, 1968.  PNGHB is a
statutory corporation with adequate powers to conduct its affairs in
accordance with sound practices, subject to certain overriding policy
powers held by the PNG Administrator and Minister of Transport.
v.        Traffic through the project ports grew from 634,o000 tons in
1968/69 to 1.114 million tons in 1970/71. Although this included major
construction items for a large copper mine now under development near the
project port of Kieta on Bougainville Island, other traffic increased by
11% p.a. over the two-year period. Over the longer term, traffic, exclusive
of copper ore, is expected to increase about 6% annually to nearly 1.5 millicn
tons in 1980/81. Growth has been and continues to be greatest at the port of Lae
1/ "Off-shore" costs relate to all expenditures for goods and services made
outside PNG, including those made in Australian dollars, the local
currency. They represent the equivalent of a foreign exchange component
to an independent country. This distinction has been made in all pre-
vious lending to PNG.



- ii -
resulting from the opening up of the New Guinea interior by the 1966 com-
pletion of a road connecting Lae with the Western Highlands; expanding areas
are being put under cultivation for both market gardenirg and cash crops
(notably coffee) by the indigenous population and by expatriates. The Lac-
Highlands road is being improved under Loan 693/Credit 204-PNG.
vi,       The demand for port services has outstripped investments, especi-
ally at Lae, which accounts for nearlytwo-thirds of the project. Because
of the geographic conditions, coastwise traffic has grown generally with
foreign traffic and at all project ports a shortage of berthing and/or stor-
age facilities has resulted in serious congestion, relieved somewhat by in-
creased productivity from a marked trend towards cargo unitization, including
containers. Another factor, contributing to congestion, has been inefficient
operational practices stemming from a multiplicity of private stevedoring
services and lack of overall organization and control. The PNGHB has the
powers necessary to correct these features and is now doing so.  It is now
agreed that the existing port By-laws will be enforced immediately and a
continuing review of further operating improvement requirements wil.. be under-
taken.
vii.      PNGHB's management is able and its staff is cormpetent.  However,
at present, most senior staff members are expatriates. PNGHB intends to in-
crease its management staff to enable it to handle its expanding responsibil-
ities >^nd to train indigenous staff members to take more respcnsible posts.
The project includes training for accounting staff.
viii.     PNGHB's tariffs have, in general, not changed since 1958; they are
not only too low but also badly structured and unrelated to costs. With a
new tariff structure, as recommended by consultants, PNIGLB will become fi-
nancially viable and the prompt introduction of appropriate revisions will
enable PNGHB to finance the local currency costs.  Credit effectiveness is
dependent upon approval of revised tariffs.
ix.       Consalting services will be provided by the Australian Mrinistry
of Works and the PINIG Public Works Department. Procurement will be on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines.
Retroactive financing of about US$250,000 will be required for detailed
engineering and soil surveys.
x.        The credit proceeds will be relent to PNGHB on Bank terms, i.e.,
for a period of 25 years including four years' grace with interest at 74%
p,a. There will also be a project agreement between PcNGHB and the Association.
xi.       The proposed project would earn an economic return of 27% and is
suitable for an IDA credit of US$9.2 million equivalent on the usual terms
to the Administration of FNG with the guarantee of the Commonwealth of
Australia.



1.  IMTRCDUCTIOI
1.01      The Administration of Papua New Guinea (PNG) has requested the
Association, through the Government of Australia, to assist in financing
improvements to the ports of Port Moresby, Lae arid Kieta and construction
of a new port at Alotau to replace existing but obsolete facilities at
Samarai.
1.02      The proposed project originated with a UNDP-financed and Bank-
supervised transport survey in 1968/69 by Sir William Halcrow and Partners
(UK), which recommended that master plans for development be drawn up for
all ports under the jurisdiction of the Papua New Guinea Harbours Board
(PNGHB). Feasibility studies and master plans were prepared by M4aunsell
and Partners (Australia) for Port Nloresby, and by NEIEC0 (Holland) for Lae,
Kieta and Alotaus A study for Port Madang by Sir Bruce White, Wolfe-Barry
and Partners (UK) is nearing completion. In August 1971 the Econonist
Intelligence Unit (EIU (UK) ) completed a tariff study for all ports which
handle foreign cargo in PNG.
1.03      The total cost of the proposed proJect would be US$11.1 million
equivalent of which the off-shore component, to be financed by the proposed
IDA credit, would be US$9,2 miMlion equivalent. The credit would be to
the PNG Adminis ½ration with the Goverrment of Australia acting as guarantor.
PNGHB would execate tLe project under the guidance of the Admij-istration's
Departmenit of Transportation.  These arrangements are similar to those
entered into in connection with previous lending operations in PNG.
1.04      This would be the first Bank Group port operation in PNG.  A com-
bined loan/credit of US$9.0 million (Nos. 693/204-PNG) was made on June 27,
1970, to finance improvements of sections of the Highlands Highway (which
links the Highlands to the port of Lae) and a detailed engineering study of a
second access road to the Highlands from the Port of Niadang.
1.05      In September/October 1971, a mission composed of Messrs. AoHa Clark
(financial analyst), N. Heggemsnes (economist), C. John (economist), D. Johx-
son (engineer) and R.Y. Scheiner (engineer-consultant) visited PNG to appraise
the project. This report is based on their findings.

2. BACKGROUND
A. Economic Settig
2.01      PNG, administered by Australia as one unit, consists of Papua, an
Australian deper.dency, and New Guinea, a United Nations Trusteeship territory.
Politically it is in a transitional stage; internal self-govermnent is
expected by 1976 and full independence some time thereafter. Physically,
it comprises the eastern half of the island of' New rjuinea (the mainland),
the northernmost Solomon Islands and the Bismarok Archipelago (Map 1). It
is a country of higl, rugged mountain ranges, wide valleys, large river
systems, jungles and swamps and has a total coastline lerigth of 6,000 mi.
Highway construction is difficult and co:3tLy.  The indigenous population is
estimated at about 2 4 million, growing at about 2.5% p.a.  The non-indigenous
population numbers about 50,000 and has grown by about 9% p.a. over the past
few years. Average population is only 13 to the sq mi but deiisity ranges from
1.5 to 60. The largest towns are Port M4oresby, the capital (about 50,000)
and Lae (about 24h000).
2.02      The economy is in an early stage of development and is based on
primary production.  Its monetary sector is heavily dependent on external
trade; annual irr,orts are currently valued at A$ 182 million while exports,
mairly copra, ccifee, cocoa, timber and timber products, and nrbber are valued
at A$ 70 million, producing an unifavorable trade balance of A$ 112 million,
i.e., about 60% of imports.  Th:fs situation is expected to imp3ove when exporta
of copper conceantrates start froim Bougainville Island in 1972.  PNG relies
heavily on technical and financial assistarnce from Australia and will continue
to do so for a long time, as Australia has indicated that it is prepared to
make substantial aid available after independence.
2q03      Subsistence-level agriculture accounts for about 40% of GI@ and is
growing at about 2.5% annually. Per capita income of the indigenous popula-
tion as a whole is about US$150 annual7y but will receive an accelerating
impetus from the combined effects of education, the growth of indigenous
agriculture, industry and tourism, and the copper mining enterprise on Bou-
gainville Island.  GNP in the monetized sector, valued at about US$390 millior.
in 1969/70, increased at constant prices at an average of 14.% annually between
1965/66 and 1968/69 and by 32% in 1969/70 (largely because of the copper enter-
prise)
2.04      Apart from small enclaves around the principal ports, there was
virtually no development of the interior or roads connecting ports on the
same island ntil after World War II and communications were by coastal
shipping.  After the war some 25,000 tons were transported annually by air
to and from the interior and the ports, mainly Madang, but also Lae. By 1966
through connection was established between Lae and Mt. Hagen - the so-called
Lae-Highlands Highway - and air traffic fell off sharply.  Madang lost part
of its traffic and has since stagnated, but conversely, the demand for port
services at Lae has outstripped the facilities.



- 3 -
2.05      In the past, economic development has been almost exclusively in
the hands of expatriates. However, an important aspect of opening up the
interior is that increasing numbers of the indigenous population are turning
from subsistence agriculture or hunting to plantation owning and cash crop
fanning. The Administration is encouraging this trend as well as the develop-
ment of light industries and tourism.
B. The Transport Sector
(a) General
2.06      Transport demand in PNG is focused upon import and export needs,
coupled with Government acministrative requirements. At present, coastal
and foreign shipping dominates the transport scene, supplemented by air
transport, but road transport is of growing significance despite the natural
geographical difficulties. There are no railways. The last few years have
been a period of rapid development which has imposed strains on all ports,
except Madang, and especially at Lae.
(b) Highways
2.07      Apart from the Lae-EDhlands Highway, the road system is largely
concentrated in unconmected areas in and near the ports and administrative
centers. There cre about 7,500 mi of public roads, of which about 300 are
urban, 1,030 are classified as primary and secondary non-urban, and 6,200 as
feeder -md access, carrying light traffic.  Registered motor vehlicles have
been ixireasing by about 17% annually since 1963 and there are now some 29,00(X
2.08      In June 1970 the Bank  Group provided Us$9.0 million to improve the
Lae-Highlands Highway to be completed by 1973/74. Also included was a detailed
engineering study for a new access road from Madang to the Western Highlands.
If this new road is constructed some 100,000 tons of traffic are expected to be
diverted from Lae to Madang, thus reducing demand for additional port invest-
ment at Lae over and above the proposed project with a corresponding increase
at Madang. Other road construction is also provisionally planned or under
way, including connection between Iiadang and Lae.
(c) Civil Aviaticn
2.09      Air transport has been the most important mode of transport for
passenger traffic, both within PNG and externally. However, the considerable
volume of freight once moved by air has decreased because of the construction
of the Lae-Highlands Highway. Passenger traffic has been increasing steadily
by about 16% annually in recent years. The only international airport is at
Port Moresby although another one is under consideration at Lae. Internal
air services are operated by Australian and domestic airlines and a few charter
companies. There are numerous airfields and airstrips in all parts of the
country.



- 4 -
(d) Seaports and Shipping
2.10      There are some 35 public seaports, jetties and landing stages.
The main ports are Port Moresby, Lae, Madang and Alotau-Samarai on New
Guinea, and Rabaul and Kieta on other islands (Map 1). These handle about
95% of PNG's foreign traffic, as well as distributing and collecting cargo to
and from the other ports by coastal vessel.  There are also a few private
special cargo ports, including Loloho, the copper company's port near Kieta
on Bougainville Island. Total traffic, foreign and coastwise, grew by about
18% annually between 1968/69 and 1970/71, foreign imports by about 16% and
exports 10%. The unusually high growth rates are in part due to requirements
of the Bougainville copper development, but the rapid development of the
country was also significant and the growth in other traffic averaged 11%.
The continuing and growing importance of coastal traffic for distributing
imports and collecting exports has resulted in competition for berth space
with overseas shipping and congestion of storage facilities at the ports.
2.11      Between 1967/68 and 1970/71 overseas ship calls rose from 530 to
700 and coastal vessels from 6,300 to 8,000. Significant changes have been
made in ship schedules and cargo-handling techniques to reduce the number of
ports of call and speed turnaronnd.  Containers and other unitized cargo-
handling methods are being empoyed to an increasing degree, achieving high
throughput rates and reducing the demand for additional investment. PNGHB
has encouraged this by introducing berth reservations for ships adopt-ing uniti-
zed ca-Igo techniques.
C. Transport Acdministration, Coordination and Development
2.12      As a result of the recommendations of the UNDP consultants and the
negotiations for the highway projct, a Department of Transportation was
created in 1970 under a Minister of Transport with primary responsibility for
all internal transportation.  Air transport, so far, remains under the
Commonwealth Department of Civil Aviation and licensing of coastal shipping
and training responsibilities under the Division of Miarine of the PMG Depart-
ment of Trade and Industry. The Department of Transportation develops
transport policy, defines investment needs, and prepares projects for sub-
mission to the Administration. Close cooperation is maintained with the PNG
Public Works Department (PI-M), responsible for highway construction and main-
tenance, and continuing assistance is given by the Commonwealth Department of
Works (COMWORKS).  Within the Departrent various Divisions and bodies are
responsible for road safety, load limits and traffic control and for licensing
and regulation of public passenger vehicles. Major public porLs are operated
and maintained by PNGHB , a statutory body responsible to the Minister, while
minor ports are controlled by the Departient of Transportation.
2,,13     The Department is conducting economic feasibility studies with the
aim of developing the interior and providing access to new areas and, where
necessary, between existing developed coastal areas.  In the past, competition
between modes has not been important but intermodal coordination will require
consideration in the future as between coastal shipping and road transport.



Lack of indigenous trained personnel is a constraint and intensive training
schemes are being undertaken by both the Administration and Commonwealth.
However, this is a long-tei'm program and expatriate personnel and consultants
will be required for many years. The progress of transport coordination will
be kept under continual review within the Bank group,
2 14      The Admiaistration's transportation program is based on the UNDP
study, and is subject to periodic review. The aim is at least a minimum
road network connecting major population, production and resource areas and
includes rural development and penetration roads. Development of the interior
and of the road network must be paralleled by port development.  The UNDP con-
sultants recommended total investment in the transport sector of about US$180
IrillIon over a period of five years of which US$126 million was for roads and
US$16 million for maritime projects. The Administration's present program to
1972/73 envisages a total of about US$124 million of which US$104 million is
for roads and US$17 million for ports and shipping. The proposed project
would be consistent- with this paogram.

3. PORT ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION
3.01      PNG's major ports are operated and maintained by PNGHB, a body
corporate capable of acquiring and disposing of real and personal property,
The Board was created by the Papua New Guinean Harbours Board Ordinance 1963.
It consists of a Chairman and six members, appointed by the PNG Minister of
Transport on the recommendation of the Adninistrator. The functions of the
Board are comprehensive and it has adequate powers to perform these functions
and to enter into contracts and agreements as necessary.  PNGHB may make By-leTJ ; 
for the control, regulation and management of the portis for which it is
res-onsible. By-laws currently exist regulating: (i) vehicular traffic, use
of machinery and handling of goods on wharves; (ii) licensing of and the
duties of stevedores, including the care of equipment;  (iii) port dues and
charges; (iv) berthing and mooring of vessels; (v) navigation; (vi) dan-
gerous goods; (vii) passenger jetties; and (viii) conduct of tha Board's
business and form of accounts. PNGHB assumed operational responsibility
for the principal ports in July 1967 and financial responsibility on January
1, 1968.
3.02      PNGHB's autonomy in day-to-day matters is subject to an overriding
provision that its actions sha-l  be governed by any policy directives given
by the Administr. or or the PLVl.ister of Transport.  Additionally, the terms
and conditions cL employment of its officers and of temporary or casual emplcye^-s
are laid down by the Minister.  Such provisions are normal and necessary to tJ.e
respo:r -ble Minimster.  In this c_se their exercise has not resulted in undue
interse--tion an(i it is expected that they will continue to be exercised in a
satisfa-,tory mamner.
3.03      Under the Ordinance creating PNGHB, the Admiristrator may declare
certain ports to be subject to PNG-B control. Nine ports have been so
designated to date:  Port Moresby, Lae, Kieta, Samarai, Madang, RaDaul,
Kavieng, Kimbe and Wewak.  It is expected that the ports of Laurengau and
Oro Bay will be added by January 1973. The port of Alotau will be placed
under PNGEB jurisdiction before construction of the proposed new port facility
begins.
3.04      Each designated port has a Port Advisory Committee of five to nine
appointed members representing port users and labor interests. The Commit-
tee is empowered to make local rules under the Ordinan,ce and By-laws on
matters relating to port operations, subject to PNGHB approval.
3.05      PNGHB, which is exempu from income taxes, must maintain proper
accounts and submit to audit by the Australian Auditor-General. Annual
reports on operations and finance are required, together with an annual
budget. Port development programs and financial plans must be prepared on
a five-year basis. All borrowing must be approved by the Administrator and
there are provisions within the Ordi.nance for Australian Government guaranteeo
of approved loans.



- 7 -
3.06      The present PNGHB Chairman is also General Manager.  The two posi-
tions are likely to be split when the present incumbent's term of office
expires in December 1972. The next senior officer is the Secretary, respon-
sible for all administrative procedures, including finance. The Adminis-
tration and PNGHB agree to consult the Association on the appointment of
Chief Executive and Chief Financial officers.
Present Accounting Systems, Audit and Insurance
3.07      At the time of appraisal the reval.uation of fixed assets taken
over by PNGHB had not been completed because no decision had been made as
to the bases to be used. Fixed assets have, therefore, been recorded at
historical written-down values.  Land was provisionally valued by the Valuer-
General of PNG but is not recorded in the accounts, the total amount being
about A$ 1.8 million. As a result, the Australian Auditor-General was
unable to complete the audit and no audit reports had been prepared. Asset
valuations were being compiled, taking inflation into account. The Admin-
istration has since decided that all land within the port area already
under PNGHB control shall be leased to PNGHB for 99 years. A law has been
passed establishing the capital of PNGHB at the capitalized value of land
leases granted to PNGHB plus the values of other property acqu--'red by
PNGHB from the A einistration; +the capital value is about A$ 801 million.
The law also urovictes for PNIGHB to pay the Administration, out of the prof-
its of any finaroial year, an amount to be determLined by the Administration
taking zcount of information furnished by PNGHB relating to it4s financial
affair,.  This is acceptable.  in this report it has been assumed that such
payments will be the equivalent of a dividend on original equity capital of
8% per annum. No payment is required from profits earned prior to July 1,
1972.
3.08      The financial accounting systems have been adequate until now,
but tosting systems have not been introduced and management information sys-
tems are rudimentary, At present, no indigenous accounting staff is em-
ployed. Because of the widespread interests of PNGHB, the substantial in-
vestments now planned and the need for a restructured tariff based on eosts,
PNGHB recognizes that the present systems are inadequate for the future,
and that new ones must be installed. The Administration and the Australian
Government have agreed to include in the project provision for installing
adequate financial, cost accounting and management information systems,
training indigenous staff at all levels in the operation of these systems,
including courses overseas, and the appointment of a consultant, satisfac-
tory to the Association, to undertake this work. It is considered that an
individual, working with existing expatriate staff, would be sufficient.
These matters were confirmed during negotiations, and undertakings obtained
that the new systems will be introduced.
3.09      The Australian Auditor-General undertakes a commercial-type audit
using qualified, competent personnel. Audit reports will be made available
to the Association and the Auditor-General is willing to report on matters
not normallY included, in such form as the Association may reasonably require.



- 8 -
This is acceptable to the Association.  To ensure the contirinued application
of sound auditing principles, agreement was obtained to the Association1s
standard audit covenants and PITGII3 undertook to appoint independent auditors,
satisfactory to the Association, and to submit copies of the audited finan-
cial statements and the auditors' report to the Association, within six
ia-Eths after the end of each financial year.
3.10      The insurance position of PNiGHB is unsatisfactory.  There is com-
pulsory insurance of motor vehicles, workmen's compensation and third-party
injury. Other assets are not insured but PINGhB is creating a reserve by
setting aside 0.52% of asset value which, in 1971, had reached A$ 66,800 on
fixed assets of about A$ 10 million. The reserve is not funded. There is
no public liability coverage for cargo, although under the Ordinance PNGHB
appears to have considerable responsibility.  During negotiations PNGHB
agreed to engage competent insurance experts to advise on the insurable
risks borne by PNiGIB and to make provision satisfactory to the Association
for adequate insurance.



4. THE PROJECT PORTS
A. Port Traffic, Current and Required Facilities
4.01      Current and projected traffic for the project ports is detailed
in Table 4(a-e) with forecasts explained in Annex 7. Annex 3 provides
details of existing facilities at each port.   The following paragraphs
provide a brief summary of the current situation and the immediate require-
ments.
Port Moresby (Hiap 2)
4.02      Located in a well-protected deep-water bay, Port ,Ioresby serves
the Central District of New Guinea. Exports are mainly rubber and copra.
General cargo traffic has grown 7$ annually from 211,000 tons in 1963/64 to
337,000 tons in 1970/71;  bulk petroleum grew from 30,000 tons to 83,000
(15% p.a.). The T-shaped wharf provides three berths - one of 700 ft with
26.5 ft of water alongside at LWOST and two inshore berths of 390 ft and
210 ft respectively with 15 ft of water alongside.  iiaintenance is good,
and the wharf has an effective life of at least 20 years.
4.03      The trend to cargo unitization has had the effect of substantially
increasing berth capacity and slightly reducing the number of ship calls;
in 1970/71, 212 overseas ships and 164 coasters called at the main wharf
and some 1,000 small craft entered the port. Available berth length is
sufficient for some years but storage space is severely restricted and will
be insufficient for expected traffic growth. The project provides for
additional open and covered storage space.
4.04      Expansion at the existing port site is restricted because of its
proximity to the town's business district. Future port development, includ-
ing the present project, will be at a new site some 500 yd eastward.
Lae (Hap 3)
4.05      The existing wharf, located in a sheltered bay, is 808 ft long and
40 ft wide with an alongside draft of 30 ft at LWOST. The wharf has an
effective remaining life of 25 years. In 1970/71 it handled 393,000 tons of
general cargo and 105,000 tons of bulk petroleum. As a result of the road
link into the Highlands, traffic has increased rapidly - 17% annually over
the past three years. Exports consist largely of coffee, tiL'ber and copra.
Ship movements in 1970/71 totalled 250 overseas ships and 229 coastal
vessels. The number of overseas vessels has remained fairly stable in recent
years but, with larger ships operating more direct schedules, the average
load per ship has increased rapidly to reach 1,250 tons in 1970/71.
4.06      The present very high dry cargo throughput of nearly 1,500 tons
per yard of berth (in addition to petroleum traffic) has been achieved only



- 10 -
by working a three-shift system; even so ship delays are serious and in-
creasing.  Lightering has been tried but has proved impracticable.  imme-
diate requirements include an additional deep-water berth, with a transit
shed and adequate storage areas, and dolphins to accomnodate coastal
tankers. Improvements beyond these immediate requirements, and their
timing, will depend on whether a new road will be built from the port of
i-Iadang into the Highlands.
Kieta (iHap 4)
4.07      The port at Kieta,the main administrative center of Bougainville
Island, started operations in 1967. In 1968/69 traffic amounted to
35,700 tons. By 1970/71, under the impetus of construction activities
related to the copper mining  development, traffic rose  to 345,100 tons of
overseas and 25,600 tons of coastal cargo. iluch of the overseas traffic,
however, was handled at the copper company's private LoLoho wharf nearby
which, when the mine is in production, will handle exports of copper concen-
trates and imports of bulk petroleum; traffic over the public wharf at
Kieta will then decline to a level more consistent with the 1968/69 movements,
based largely on copra exports.
4.08      The wharf is 208 ft long with an alongside depth of 26 ft at LWOST.
Sections on each side of the deep-wvater berth are used for coastal vessels.
However, additioinial coaster berths and cargo sheds are required which would
permit the diversion of coastal traffic from the single short deep-water
berth aind avoid current delays to overseas shipping.
Alotau/Samarai (1.ap 5)
4.09      In 1968, the administrative center of the IIilne Bay District was
moved from the island of Samarai to Alotau on the mainland where a new town-
ship is developing. A small wharf was built at Alotau to handle building
materials but overseas traff-c continued to be handled at Samarai and distrib-
uted from that port. However, its facilities (a 300 ft long outshore berth
with 26e5 ft of water alongside at LWOST) are old and unsafe for medium or
heavy loads. As a result, overseas lines, specializing in container and
palletized traffic, are bypassing the port to an increasing degree and
traffic has increased only 2.5.c annually over the past seven years and is
now showing signs of stagnating.
4.10      The small wharf recently built at Alotau attracted 3-4,000 tons of
general cargo in 1970/71. It is now intended to build a new port here, suit-
able for modern overseas services to serve the new administrative center and
replace the obsolete port at Samarai. This construction is part of the
proposed project.
B. Port operations
4.11      All four ports operate seven days a week throughout the year.  Port
IMoresbyp Kieta and Samarai work a two-shift system and Lae three shifts. For



- 11 -
unitized cargo productivity is good, up to 60 tons/ship hour but for break-
bulk it is low, about 20 tons and coastal cargo is handled at less than 10
tons/ship hour. Improirement can be effected by better operating procedureso
Traditionally, at each port, several companies operate their otm stevedoring
services (under license from PNGHB), hiring local labor from nearby villages,
providing their owqn equipment, working the ships and cargo of certain ship-
ping lines and reserving wharf and storage space from the port managers.
Cargo-handling methods are poor and labor is untrainedc  PN11G  has adequate-
powers under its By-laws to control stevedoring activities and enforce effi-
cient operating procedures but had not applied them. PNGHB will provide
the equipment for Alotau and some specialized equipment at other ports not
already provided by the stevedoring companies.
4.12      During appraisal, discussions were held with the PNG Administration
and the Australian Government on the question of improving port operations.
The need for improvement was accepted and it was agreed that consider- --
able improvement could be effected immediately by enforcing existing By-laws;
this, PNGHB are now doing and have arranged to collect data to assess the
extent of resultant improvements in port efficiency. The Administration
also undertook to consider, in the light of experience gained from this
action, what additional organizational changes should be taken over the
longer term.
14.13     Since proper operational control requires trained staff, a
training progran is of immediate importance to PNGHB.  The PNG Administration
and the Australian Government have fairly extensive programs underway or
under development. Prior to negotiations the respective Governments re-
Viewed their training programs, and evidence, satisfactory to the Associ-
ation, of the adequacy of the programs was provided.

5. THE PROJECT
A.  ProMect Items
5.01      The project, details of which are given in Annex 5, would
essentially consist of:
i)   land reclamation, a storage shed and stacling area at
Port Moresby (Map 2);
ii)   construction of one deep-water berth at Lae, designed to
accommodate container traffic, as an extension of the
existing wharf (Map 3);
iii)   construction of coaster berth facilities at the port
of Kieta (map 4);
iv)   construction of a small new port at Alotau (Map 5);
v)   consulting services for detailed engineering, suxpervision
n" constructioci of items (i) to (iv) above, soil surveys and
hydrographic investigations;
vi)   provision of ca.go-handling equipment;
vii)   a training program;
and covers most of PNGHBts firm investment program up to 1975/76 with the
exception of a proposed port extension of Madang, the justification for
which is subject to Qther factors (para. 5.13).
B. Cost Estimates
5.02      The total estimated cost of the project would be A$ 9.35 million
(US$)1.1 million equivalent) with an off-shore component of US$9.2 million
equivalent. A summary follows and details are given in Table 1.

5,03      The cost of the sivi1 engineering works is based on known costs
of labor and materials in PNG, ard on costs of port construction works under-
taken there recently, Because of uncertainties regarding the possible rise
in construction costs in the area in view of mining and other developments,
And to allow for inflation generally, a price contingency of 15% is provided
based on an assumed inflation rate of 6% per year. A quantities contingency
of 20% is included for construction and engineering as further soi.i inves-
tigations fcr detailed design are still being carried out. Off-shore costs
would be about 80% of the total estimated construction cost because PNG
lacks most construction materials. Materials and equipment are not subject
to import restrictions, nor is any duty imposed on equipment, provided that
it is re-exported upon completion of the project.  Papua iew Guinea has no
preference arrangements with regard to imports.
5.04      Neither the equipment requirements (para. 4.11) nor the training
program (para. 3,08) can be defined precisely, and provisional sums have
therefore been included for these two items.
C. Subsoil Conditions
5.05      Subsoil conditions at all ports, based on past pile-driving experi-
ence, are favorable~ Further borings and pile test loadings are to be under-
taken during the detailed design stages. Because PNG lies in the center of a
circumpacific earthquake belt and medium-to-severe tremors often occur,
all wharves would be founded on steel piles. The piled structures in Lae,
Kieta and Alotau and the rock embankments in Port Moresby would be designed to
resist the lateral accelerations caused by high-scale tremors up to 7.0 on
the Richter Scale.



- 14 -
D. Execution
5.06      PNGHB will be responsible for execution of the project, under
the general supervision of the PNG Department of Transportation and the
project agreement between the Association and PNGHB.
E. Engineering Consultant Services
5.07      PNGHB have engaged the Australian Department of Wilorks to complete
detailed engineering, prepare tender documents and supervise construction
works for Port Moresby and Lae. The PNG Public Works Department has been
engaged for similar activities for Kieta and Alotau. Engaging the PNG
Public Works Department conforms with that Department's policy of providing
engineering training for its staff and of avoiding the expense of using
consultants whenever work is within the physical and technical capability of
the Department. Australian Department of Works staff engaged on such
consultancy work do not form part of the PNG Administration staff but are
contracted separately for such work.
F. Procurement and Disbursement
5.o0      Construction and supply contracts would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordarce with Bank Group guide-
lines and would be subject to Association approval.
5.09      Based upon the estimated off-shore component of total cost, dis-
bursement from the credit account would be 82% for all civil engineering
works, actual foreign exchange cost of the engineering consultant services
and training schemes and the c.i.f. landed cost of imported cargo-handling
equipment.
5.10      Including engineering, soil surveys, hydrographic investigations
and bidding procedures, the whole project would take 48 months to complete.
Assuming credit effectiveness on August 1, 1972, total expenditure and credit
disbursement could be expected to be as summarized below and detailed in
Tables 2(a) and 2(b). Any surplus funds available on completion of the
project would be cancelled.

G. Land Acquisitimn
5.11      What little land is required for the project at Port Moresby, Lae
and Alotau is state land, but the small area necessary at Kieta is privately
swned and assurances have been mbtained that all necessary steps to obtain
legal title to land necessary for the project shall have been taken by June 30,
1972.
H. Finance
5.12      The proposed IDA cmdit of US 9.2 million would finance the estima-
ted off-shore or foreign exchange conponcnt of the proiect.  PNGHB would be
expected to prnvide the lecal currency, estimated at US$1.9 million equivalent,
from internally generated resources. Retroactive financing would be required
to ccrer engineering and soil investigations started in November 1971, and is
expected to amount to about US$250,000.
I. Other Port Develop1ents
5.13      In addition to the proposed project works, PNGHB is now constructing
coaster wharf facilities at the western extreme of Lae's existing deep-water
wharf (Map 3) at an estimated cost of A$ h00,000. These facilities will
enable all coasters of t.p to 1,500 dwt to be handled away from the main wharf.
An investment of A$ 430,000 is alsm under way at Rabau. Table 3 summarizes
the development program which provides for an investment of A$ 4.7 million at
Madang during 1973-77, A$ 4.5 million for further expansion at Lae during
1976-80 and A$ 2.7 million at Port Moresby during 1973-77. If the projected
Madang-Highlands road is built, the investment at Madang will be necessary
to enable it to handle the estimated volume of traffic that would be diverted
from Lae. If the road is not constructed, an equivalent investment may be
required at Lae. Total investment program is A$ 13 million (other than the project)
J. Ecology
5.14      The proposed project would not resu)t in any ecological disturbances
in the ports of Port Moresby, Lae, Kieta and Alotau.  There is no conmercial
fishing carried out in the immediate areas of the four ports. Further, the
small amounts of dredging to be carried out along the wharf front at Lae and
Al*tau involve sand and silt and no coral. Appropriate arrangements for
dealing with any possible oil spillage will be made.

6.  TRAFFIC FORECASTS AND ECO-i0IEC TJAUJATION
A. Traffic Forecasts
6.0o      The project ports - Port i;oresby, Lae, Kieta and Alotau/Samarai -
handle about two-thirds of total PNG cargo traffic. Iln 1970/71, these ports
handled 1,'140,000 freight tons of general cargo and 190,000 tons of petroleum
products over their public wharves;  200,000 tons of this total traffic were
in coastal trade.
6.02      Traffic forecasts for the project ports were prepared by the
appraisal mission on the basis of various consultants' reports and discus-
sions with PNGH3, the PNG Administration and informed sources in the private
sector,and are summarized below (see Annex 7).

L, 1968/69
* Including private copper port of Loloho, near Kieta.
6.03      Overseas dry cargo traffic is forecast to increase by approximately
5% p.a. in Port iioresby.  Imports are expected to increase by 10% p.a. in
Lae and Samarai/Alotau, and by 8% in Kieta;  exports by 8% p.a. in Lae and
10% p.a. in Kieta and Samarai/Alotau.  These high growth rates are not, however,
expected to materialize before the project is completed.   Coastal traffic
is expected to increase by 6%' p.a. in Lae, and by 5% in Port iHoresby and
Alotau/Samarai; in Kieta, incoming coastal cargo by 10, outgoing by 5%.
6.o4      The forecasts are conservative and generally lower than those of
the consultants.  In the case of Lae, overseas traffic expected to be
diverted from Lae to hladang, after completion of the proposed ,'adang-Highlands
road, amounts to about 100,000 tons in the first year (assumed to be 1975/
76) rising to 187,000 tons in 1980/AI. Considering the uncertainty regarding
this road, traffic has been forecast with and without the road (Tables 4(b)
and (c)).

6.05      Before evaluating the benefits of the project, an assessment was
made of the extent to which present port productivity could be improved
solely by inproving operating procedures (paras. 4.11 and 4.12). The follow-
ing table shows estimated average handling rates in the different ports and
compares 1971 conditions withl rates aclievable with and without further
investment.  The rate which can be achieved without the project would not be
adequate to meet the forecast traffic.

Ben-fits
6.06      The project is designed to increase capacity and improve cargo-
handling rates in all ports. The principal benefits will be:
(i)  reduction in anticipated ship waiting time which will
rise sharply if port capacity is not increased soon;
(ii)  reduction in ship service time through increased
cargo-handling rates; and
(iii)  reduction in  cargo-handling costs.
6.07      The reduction in ship wTaiting and service times has been evaluated
by the use of a mathematical model developed by the Bank Grotup.  Benefits
from lower cargo-handling costs have been estimated on the anticipated inpro-
vements in handling rates.  Since a major portion of cargo-handling costs
is labor costs and labor is not in short supply in PYG, a further analysis
was made on the assumption that real savings in cargo-handling costs will
be only 50% of the financial cost.
6.o8      The rationale in estimating the benefits is outlined in  Annex 8.
Benefits from generated traffic are not included in the cost-benefit analysis.
Except in the case of Alotau/Samarai, these are small and will not affect
the conclusions.  At Alotau/Samarai, the generated benefits just about



- 16 -
offset the relatively large costs of moving part of the port from Samarai
to Alotau (Annex 9).
Internal Rates of Return
6.09      Based on the benefits as outlined above, the internal rates of
return are estimated as follows:
Kieta                          3 1J
Samarai/Alotau                 31'5
Lae                            23,
Port iloresby                  50ic
Total Project                  27/o
These very satisfactory economic returns are due to substantial benefits
from the fact that the project is somewhat overdue and to the relatively
small investments, which will permit the further development of unitized
cargo handling.  Details of th3ss benefits for the first full year after
project completioln are given In J_able 5.  About one-half° of the sarings in
ship time (see para. 7.16) and all of the savings in cargo-handlint costs
will a-,crue directly to the PNG econorny and will by themselves yieljd an
econoimic return of about 20, on the investments.
6.10      The returns were tested for sensitivity to changes in the values
of the principal variables. Variation in the capital costs of the project
is the area of greatest sensitivity.  A i5% capital cost overrun would lower
the ecornomic return of the project to 23%, The return is relatively insen-
sitive to variations in the value of savings in cargo-handling costs. A
50% reduction in  these savings, to allow for the fact that the full financial.
costs of labor do not represent econoriLc costs, only reduced the return to
24`  The resultcs are shown in ''able 6, As already explained in para. 6.04
the traffic forecasts are conservative and the returns were therefore not
tested for sensitivity to changes in tr-affic volumes.
6.11      Should the proposed Ladanc-Highlands road not be constructed,
Hiadang port could not serve uhe interior by truck, and further port develop-
ment at- Lae would be necessary by 1978/70 (see Annex 6) as air tranisport
from the Highlands to lIadang, at an average cost of US$75/ton, is the only
alternative.
6.12      Because of the many capacity and traffic possibilities in Lae, a
simulation study was carried out.  The results (discussed in Annex 7O) indicate
that the project is already overdue and will be sufficient to handle
traffic up to 1981/82 provided that the Hadang-Eighlands road is constructed.

7. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. Present Position
7.01      The present tariff structure and levels of rates have remained
almost unchanged since 1958 except for an increase in the storage charge to
encourage clearance of cargoes from the transit sheds. The tariff has
developed piecemeal and, although not over-complicated, is not related to
costs. In particular, berthage dues on ships are not related to time or to
long-run marginal costs and in 1970/71 provided only about 11% of total
revenue. An undue proportion of total revenue (about 44% in 1970/71) is
derived from wharfage on cargo. Since ships do not carry a direct charge
closely related to cost, there is no incentive for owners to use facilities
economically. A summary of the present tariff is given in Table 7. It is
generally accepted by port users that the level of tariffs is low.
7.02      The draft financial accounts ancd balance sheets to June 30, 1971
have been modified by Association staff to take account of accrued interest
on sinking funds and the provisional land valuation. The modified revenue
accounts are given in Table 9 and balance sheets in Table 11.
7.03      The Administration's interest in the Port assets transferred to
PNGHB is represented by equity capital. PNGHB's investment funds have been
provided largely by loans from the Administration. Details are given in
Table 12. All loans are for 25 years repayable by annual sinking fund
appropriations of 2% of the capital amount (Table 13). Interest is payable
on the full amount half-yearly. The total amount of loans to June 1971 is
A$ 1,457,000 (US$1.74 million). As yet, sinking fuind appropriations are
not properly funded in income earning investments. firing negotiations
PNGHB undertook to invest the appropriations so as to produce the full amounts
due at maturity.
7.o4      Up to 1969/70, the financial rate of return on net fixed assets
was more than 5%. However, operating expenses in 1970/71 and 1971/72 show
substantial increases, because of unusual expenditures on maintenance arrears,
thus depressing the rate of return to 4.0% and 2.1% respectively.
7.o5      The present tariffs are adequate to earn a moderate financial
return on the present asset valuation, but are too low to enable PNGHB to
achieve acceptable financial targets.
B. Financial and Tariff Policy
7.06      In their recent report on port charges, EIU recommended that the
principle of wharfage be retained but that the berthage charge be restruc-
tured on the basis of time and length of berth occupied. In the absence of
a costing system, their recommended rate levels are based on total results
and take into account the possibility of paying a dividend on original



- 20 -
equity, as well as financing a share of the investment program. A summary
of the recommendations is given in Table 8.  The consultants' approach is
satisfactory to the Association. The consultants show that port costs in
PNG are relatively small in relation to total transportation costs, and
that substantial tariff increases would have very little effect on such
costs and therefore no harmful effects an PNG's economy. The main changes
recommended would be a) ships' berthage charge changed from A$ 0.05 per four
gross registered tons per day to A$ 0.03 per ft length per hour; effectively
an increase of some 350%, and (b) an effective increase in wharfage on cargo
of about 130%. Overall, the tariff increases would about double PNGHB's
operating revenues.
7.07      The Ordinance does not specify any financial policy, other than
the provision in the amendment regarding payments to the Administration out
of PNGHB's profits (para. 3.08). However, during negotiations this matter
was discussed and agreement reached in principle as follows:
a)   As an essential transportation link in the country's economy,
PNGHB should be required to provide efficient port services
at reasonable cost anci, as a commercial Government enter-
prise responsible for substantial investments, it should be
able to pay to the Administration a reasonable dividend on
its equity capital.
b)  PNGHB should relieve the Adainistration from the burden of
financing its own investment so far as it can do so by apply-
ing reasonable tariffs.
o) These objeatives require good operations procedures, proper
cost control systems and a pricing (tariff) policy relevant
to its needs. Ports provide a variety of services to two
principal types of user, ships and cargo, and while total
financial costs must be covered, the customer should pay
the economic costs of the individual services he uses. This
is important, to avoid undesirable cross-subsidization, to
ensure that the cargo owner does not pay twice for ships'
port costs (in freight rates andin port tariffs on cargo),
and so that uneconomic port activities are not encouraged.
d)   Separate tariffs shoula be levied for individual categories
of services and facilities, based on the costs of providing
the services and facilities, including adequate maintenance
and depreciation, and should be set to recover to the
economy so much of the economic benefits of investments,
which would otherwise accrue elsewhere, as would not adversely
affect such external pricing policies as ocean freight rates.
C. Future Earnings
7.08      Forecast revenues for PNGHB are based on the traffic forecasts for
all PNGHB ports and on the new tariff structure and levels of rates recommended
by EIU becoming effective by July 1, 1972 for services other than wharfage,
and for wharfage by July 1, 1973. Assumptions used are given in Annex 11.
Debt service forecasts are given in Table 10.

1971/72; 1973/74, the first full year of the new tariffs; 1977/78, and 1980/81,

7.10      In 1971/72 the operating ratio is high because of the low tariff
levels and abnormal maintenance costs.  In 1973/74 the ratio is low because
new tariff rates are assumed, not offset by increased costs. After completion
of construction operating ratios are relatively low, even considering that
PNGHB does not undertake stevedoring or shore-handling. Interest and debt
service coverage are ample. A 15% cost overrun on the project would only
reduce the financial rates of return by 0.3%. Over the longer term, PNGHB
should be capable of earning at least 8% on net fixed assets in use and could
easily support normal debt service of the IDA credit on Bank terms. After
payment of debt interest, since PNGHB is exempt from income tax, earnings
would be sufficient to pay a dividend of 8% on equity capital, which the
Association would consider reasonable (see para. 3,08).
D. Financing Plan, Cash Flow and Balance Sheets
7.11      A detailed cash flow statement is given in Table 14. The state-
ment below summarizes the funds required and the sources of such funds during

16.5           19.6         100
7.12      PNGHB would be able to finance with internally generated funds
one-third of its total financial requirements, leaving a small cash
surplus available for further investments. During negotiations it was
agreed that the Credit would be relent by the Administration to PNGHB on
Bank terms, i.e. for a period of 25 years including four years of grace
with interest at 7V p.a. Although no firm arrangements have yet been
made for other borrowings, PNGHB should have no difficulty in securing
loans to finance other capital expenditures. The financing plan is
satisfactory. Should there be any project cost over-run or any shortfall
in the internal cash generation during the construction period, the assumed
dividend could be reduced. During negotiations the Administration under-
took to provide funds as may be required to complete the project.
7.13      After the completion of the project, PNGHB would be able to make a
reasonable contribution to the cost of the further investments planned, while
retaining substantial cash balances. The projections show that cash reserves
would amount to about A$ 5 million at June 30, 1981 after paying an annual
dividend of 8% on the Administration's original equity.
7.14      Tne forecast balance sheets (Table 11) show a healthg position.
The highest debt/equity ratio, at a satisfactory 55/45, occurs in 1977 and
1978.

E. Conclusions and Undertakings on Financial Aspects
7.15      Increases in tariffs to levels recommended by the consultants,
to be readjusted as between individual services and facilities to achieve
the same overall revenue when costing data are available, would enable
PNGHB to finance its investment program and generally comply with the
financial policy detailed in para. 7.07. The financial forecasts indicate
that the longer-term financial targets would be met by earning a financial
rate of return of 8% after completion of construction of the project. A
substantial proportion of the economic benefits from the project which would
otherwise not immediately accrue to the economy would be recovered by cost-
based tariffs on ships. Berthage under the existing tariff is estimated at
A$ 139,0L00 for 1971/72, and under the new tariff at As 651,000 in 1972/73
rising to A$ 768,000 in 1975/76 and A$ 915,000 in 1978/79, thus directly
recovering about 50% of those savings. When new costing systems can
identify the respective costs there should be scope for further adjustment
of rates as between ship and cargo and opportunity to recover further
savings for the economy.
7.16      Over the longer term, after completion of the present investment
programs, and in the absence of economic developments requiring additional
port investments, the tariffs are likely to be higher than necessary to
achieve the targets and may earn unnecessarily high financial rates of
return. In that event, principal alternative solutions would be to increase
the dividend on equity or to reduce the tariffs, especially those on cargo.
7.17      To meet the agreed financial objectives and pricing policy under-
takings were obtained that PNGHB would:
a)   (subject to approval by the Administrator in Council) introduce
tariffs for services and facilities other than wharfage no later
than July 1, 1972, and for wharfage no later than July 1,
1973, and thereafter maintain them, substantially at the
levels recommended by EIU;
b)   introduce as soon as possible a cost accounting system to
determine the relevant costs of the various services and
facilities it provides;
c)   promptly thereafter, but not later than July 1, 1976,
introduce and maintain tariffs of dues and rates:
i)   set as far as practical for each port individually;
ii)   levied for all ships and goods using its services and
facilities; and
iii)   based on, and not less than, the economic costs of
these services and facilities, taking into account the
desirability of ensuring that a sufficient proportion
of total economic benefits (particularly those enjoyed
by ships) resulting from the port investments accrue
to PNG's economy;



- 24 -
d)   except as the Association and the Borrower shall otherwise
agree, take all necessary measures, including but not limited
to adjustments in tariffs, as may be required to earn an
annual rate of return of not less than 8% on not fixed assets
in operation; and
e)   except as the Association should otherwise agree, not incur
any debt unless its net revenue (before providing for depre-
ciation) for the fiscal year next preceding the date of such
incurrence or for a later twelve-month period ending prior
to the date of such incurrence, whichever is greater, shall
be not less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service require-
ments for any succeeding year on all the debt of PNGHB, in-
cluding the debt to be incurred.
7,18      Since approval by the Administrator in Council to the introduction
of tariffs under para. 7.17 (a) above has not yet been received, receipt of
such approval is a condition of signing,



- 25 -
8. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During credit negotiations, agreement was reached on the
following principal points:
(a)  PNGHB will continue to collect and evaluate data to assess
the results of training programs presently in operation
and the efficiency of port operations (paras. 4.12 and 4.13);
(b) a pricing policy was agreed to, including the desirability
of ensuring that a sufficient proportion of the economic
benefits arising from port investments accrue to PNG's
economy (para. 7.07);
(c) port tariffs will be increased to enable PNGHB to finance
the project and other investments (para. 7.17(a));
(d)  PNGHB will introduce costing systems to enable cost-based
tariffs to be introduced by July 1, 1976 (para. 7.17(b)
and (c)); and
(e) an 8% financial return on net fixed assets in use by PNGHB
(para. 7.17(d).
8.02      A condition of signing the credit is the receipt by the Association
of approval by the Administrator in Council to tariff increases in 8.01(c)
above (para. 7.18).
8.03      The proposed project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$9.2 million
to Papua New Guinea to be relent to PNGHB for a term of 25 years including a
four-year grace period with interest at 740 p.a.

Total Foreign Traffic Development
The Economist Intelligence Unit recently made an extensive traffic
forecast, based upon the forecasts made by Sir Wgilliam Halcrow and Partners
and recent developments in the area, covering all twelve ports in PNG
handling foreign cargo.
Foreign traffic increased from one million tons in 1966/69 to 14
million tons in 1970/71, and is expected to increase to 2.6 million tons
in 1900/ol, corresponding to an average growth rate of 6% p.a. This is
considered reasonable.
The forecast does not include the export of copper and copper ore
which will move over private facilities. It also does not include logs
(estimated to increase from 150 million su ft in 1970/71 to 217 million
su ft in 1974/75) since most are loaded overside from the water and not
over the wharves.
The particulars for each of the 12 ports follow.

C. Labor Productivity
Statistics on stevedore: andquay labor productivity are limited.
The only statistics which are kept continuously relate to gross and net cargo
discharge rates per gang hour. These are taken from the stevedoring report
submitted for each ship calling at the port and relate to total cargo dis-
charged and loaded. Statistics are not available for different types of
cargo. An analysis of these reports for the year 1970-71 for Port 1Moresby
and Lae and a six week period (17th July-31st August, 1971) for Kieta yields
the following results:

Since those ships with reservations are required to have at least 85% of
their cargo unitized in either containers, flats or pallets, the difference
in handling rates between these two classes of overseas ships gives an
approximate indication of the differential between handling cargo which is
unitized and that in the conventional form.

D. Cargo-Handling Methods Used
Overseas cargo is handled either by sl-ips' c,ear or  i.a s.de  z,.:ts;
Coastal cargo is usually handled either manually or bmy ahips' de.Cckcs
depending on the size and the cargo concerned.
All cargo-handling equipment at each of the three ports is privately
owned by stevedoring companies and is used in conjunction with the ship's
equipment to load and discharge cargo,  Consistent with oirmership, this
equipment is maintained and operated by the respective stevedoring companies
and is generally in very good condition. A summary of available cargo-handling
equipment  is 2iven belo..:

Stevedoring labor conditions are governed by awards under the
Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1962-70. An award takes the form of an
agreement between the Employers, Federation of Papua New Guinea and the
Workers' Associ.ation, Union or village headmen of the district in hich
the port is situated, certified by the Inadustrial Registrar. The provisions
of the Native ETnployment Ordinance apply to all such awards.
The awards regulate stevedores' rates of pay, holidays, working
hours and overtime, provision of meals, accommodation and transport, and
reasons for dismissal. Rates of pay for normal working hours vary at the
project ports as follows:

A PPRAISAL 07  POiT PROJEECT
Analysis of Alternative Port Development Schemes
1.        Alternative port development schemes in all ports were considered
by the mission, based partly on investigations by the consultants.
2.        For Port 14oresbb  several development alternatives were considered,
both outside and inside the present port area. The main alternatives analyzed
were:
(a) to provide an open storage area and a new shed outside
the present port area; and
(b) to provide similar facilities as above, but inside the
present port area and including two coastal berths.
Alternative (a) has been chosen by the Administration as the best from a
long-term developmental point of view. Alternative (b) was more costly
but showed a sliglatly higher internal rate of return.
3.        In Alotau/Samarai only two alternatives exist because of the
dilapidated condition of the wharf:
(a) moving the present port in Samarai to the new district
capital, Alotau, and
(b) modernizing or rebuilding present facilities in Samarai.
Although the direct costs were considered to be the same in both alternatives,
the net benefits off moving the port to the new regional capital were con-
sidered to be much greater. A further alternative of transporting part of
the cargo by lighter was rejected as uneconomical.
4.        Five alternative sites were considered by the consultants in
Bougainville because of the present drawbacks (swells etc.) in Kieta.
Only a new port at a nearby island, having wharves on a dradged lagoon,
would eliminate the swells, but this alternative was rejected as too costly.
5.        Becauise of the many development possibilities in Lae  each depending
upon certain traffic developments, a simulation study was carried out to
investigate the following alternatives:



A5DEX 5
Page 2
(a) the construction of one berth (600 ft) extension to the
existing wharf (the project);
(b)  the construction of a separate coaster berth;
(c) the construction of a separate oil berth; and
(d)  a longer version of (a).
The codaination of alternatives (a), (b) and (c) was found to be the most
economical solution independent of the various traffic development
alternatives.
6.        The project is generally consistent with the most economical long-
term solutions.  It will provide sufficient capacity in all four ports for
at least 10 years with the exception of Lae.  In Lae further exeansions
may be needed before 1978/79 if the new road to the Highlands is not imple-
mented, and inl191/C,2 if the road is completed.

Future Car  ows through the Project Ports
A. Bases for Pro.jections
1.        PMG presents a traffic forecasting problem because of the small
but rapidly grawing economy, the difference between the size and per capita
income of the expatriate and the indigenous population, and the unpredict-
able results of impending self-govenIment and independence.
2.        The expatriates number 50,000 with a per capita income of US$)4,800
while the indigenous people number 2.5 million with a per capita income of
about US$120 existing largely on subsistence agricultureO There is a great
difference between the import requirements and exportu capacity of the twto
population groups.
3.        The monetary sector of the econony has been growndg at an overall
rate of 10% p.a. and has soared to as much as 25% p.a. in some parts of the
country over tlhe past two years.  This high growth rate has been influenced
by some large investments over the past five years. The Bougainville
opnc r p2ro$Ct,      all :il XnvC&Olc.Cnt of kI !'O0 hO llion, halS had a substmntial
impact on growth, GITP and imloorts. Other projects in the oil exploration
and mining fields have also had an effect on G-NP and on the demand for
imports.
4.        Private investments in growth industries such as mining, agri-
culture and forestry will affect both the volume and value of exports. The
rate of grmoth, the capacity to industrialize and the effect of future poli-
tical development on private investment, will determine the extent of import
substitution. The present Governnmnt's development strategy is to attract
private investment.
5.        Coastal cargo is bound to increase rapidly, and will require, to
an increasing degree, separate port facilities to alleviate congestion and
ship waiting time, particularly at Lae, Kieta and Port Moresby.
6.        The traffic forecasts have been influenced by the various con-
sultantst reports, discussions with those Government departments respon-
sible for planning and programming and with private business.  The traffic
figures submitted by the PNIGIE3, on which it bases its levies, have been
considered the most accurate.
B. Port Moresby-
7.        There are some factors which tend to affect the traffic development
potential of Port M4oresby. They include divergent views regarding the sit±ns



iF,-X 7
Page 2
of the capital after  independence;  the lack of a foreseeable large
future developiment of Port 1M1oresby wJhich i~ould create a large growth rate
of overseas and coastal traffic;  the developrment of neighboring ports such
as Alotau which will reduce thie flowi of traffic, part-icularly coastal traffic.
It was observed that actual traffic movements through the port, in general,
fell short of the projections made by Haunsell and Partners.  For example,
YMaunsell and Partners forecast that total traffic, excluding petroleum,
passing throagh the port would be 418,000 tons in 1969/70;  this compares
with actual throughput of 304,000 tons in the same year and 336,000 tons in
1970/71. From Table 4 it can be seen that actual irports have been relatively
static for the past three years and a growth rate of 5% for imports, which
is in line with the rate of growth of populatiorb was adopted.
8.        Exports, at 31,000 tons in 1967/69, decreased slightly to 30,000
tons in 1968/69 and then increased again to 49,000 tons in 1970/71. This
latter level is about double Haunsell's 1979/80 projection, .largely because
of the rapid development of cargo unitization.  In 1470, 50% of the outward
cargo consisted of returned pallets.
9.        It was agreed with the Economic Adviser's Office in Port Horesby
that the increase in the production of rubber and copra, the main commodities,
will not exceed 5% p.a.  The actual 1970/71 export figures were used as the
basis for export projections which were made up to 1981. The projected growth
rates are considered to represent the upper limit of the anticipated develop-
ment of Port Moresby.
C. Lae
10.       A comparison between actual traffic, which went through the port of
Lae for the period 1968/69 to 1970/71, and WEBJECO traffic projections follows.

11.       It follows from the above figures that the actuial figures fluctu-
ated around NEDECOIs projections with some deviation in 1979/70 in the case
of overseas traffic and relative>l,r marked deviatf.on in th'.e case of coast,al
traffic in 1970/71. One of the mainr reasons for this is the effect of the
large imports required by the Bougainville copper project.
12.       NEDECO assumed ani import growth rate of 10% for Lae and vicinity
in line with the rise in monet+ary GNP, and a much higher growth rate in the
Highlands.  Lae is a rapidly growing industrial town and a 10% growth rate
for imports is not unrealistic.
13.       NEDECO assumed that if the road linking xladang with the Highlands
were to be completed by 1976, it would divert 165,000 tons of incoming cargo
from Lae to Madang.  This diversion is considered to be too highl.  The topo-
graphy of the Highlands is very rugged and transport costs of moving the
diverted traffic will be rather high. Also, iviadang may not be able to handle
this diverted traffic if port facilities are not extended, despite its natural
physical advantage over Lae. In view of the transport costs, it is considered
that not more than 100,000 tons of imports will be diverted to NAadang in, 1976.
14.       For outgoing traffic from the Highlands, a groizth rate of 8% p.a.
as against IEDECO's 10% or more was adopted.  This is in line with the expected
growth rate of coffee, copra, cocoa and timber production in the Highlands.
Outgoing traffic, estimated at 17,000 tons as against NEDECO's 16,000 tons,
will be diverted to INladang from Lae after 1976. For coastal traffic NEDECO's
6% growth rate is considered realistic.
D. Kieta
15.       There are three ports on the island of Bougainville serving three
different purposes:  (i) Loloho, which used to handle both general cargo and
oil but now handles only oil; (ii) the Bougainville Copper Proprietary's
(BCP) separate port about 12 mi from Kieta handling only the export of
copper and import of oil needed by the copper mines. (The copper company
has given the PNG Administration an undertaking that all other products,
including its spare parts and other imported goods, will be imported through
Kieta.) (iii) Kieta, which is the main administrative center of the island.
The port wds constructed in 1969 and overseas cargo imports for Kieta and
Loloho together rose 19,000 tons in 1968/69 to an estimated 302,500 tons in
1970/71; separate data for each port are not available.
16.       Considering the type of development actually taking place on the
island, a 10% annual increase in imports comprising mostly building materials
for the toum and the copper mines as well as general cargo was assumed as
opposed to the 7.8% growth rate adopted by NEDECO.
17.       Exports through Kieta consist mainly of agricultural products:
copra, cocoa and coffee. Total copra production on the island in 1970 was
20,000 tons, which is expected to increase by 5% over the next five years
and fall slightly after 1978 because of a shortage of labor. This was con-
firmed by the Rural Development Office in Kieta. Of this figure only 8,000



AIiNEX 7

tons went through Kieta;  the rest was exported through Rabaul. After the
completion of the port project and the road, which is beizi' conctz.Ucted to
link Kieta with the production areas, Kieta!s share of copra eJ-pots is
expected to increase by at least 10%.
18.       6,C00  tons of cocoa were produced on the island of which about
2,000 tons were shipped thrcugh Kieta.  Cocoa prodluction will continue to
rise by 5% p.a. up to 1976, thereafter falling slightly because of labor
shortages.  For projection purposes, a total export figure for coffee, copra
and cocoa of 13,000 tons in 1971 was used, rising by 10, p.a. to 1980/81.
E. Samarai/Alotau
19.       Samarai is a small island just off the mainland, handling all
foreign trade of the Hilne Bay district. Alotau is the proposed new port and
the administrative center of the district. The Alotau traffic forecast is
based on past and present trends in traffic movements in Samnarai and possi-
bilities of future development of the Yilne Bay district.
20.       Prospects for the Milne Bay district depend mainly on:
(a) expansion of copra production;
(b) exploitation and export of its vast forest resources; and
(c) mining and oil de-velopment.
(a) From information supplied by the Australian Department of Agricul-
ture, Stock and Fisheries, plantings of coconut trees by indigenous and non-
indigenous growers have been exceptionally high during the last three years.
The total acreage involved is 40,000 with a production capacity of 7,000
tons of cocG1ut.
(b) Forestry, on the other hand, has shoi.n no marked increase up to
1969/70, but the prospects are very promising. NEDECO estimated that some
20 million su ft of timber can be produced p.a. from the Sagarai forests with
a value of A$ 3.5 million. A higher estimate of 50 million was made by the
local people. A reasonable figure is expected to be between 30 and 50 million.
However, in the absence of any detailed study, it is difficult to in,clude
the timber figures in the traffic forecast.
21.       Nining and oil exploration remain less significant.  The Adminis-
kration confirmed, however, that about A$ 22 million will be spent around
the Milne Bay area on oil exploration. This, again, will have a strong
effect on imports.  There is a possibility that most of the timnber and
timber products will be shipped through a private facility. If this happens,
a substantial proportion of the general cargo and equipment which will be
.required by the forest industries "Till have to go through the port of Alotau.
Also, the multiplier effects produced by spending on timber will induce an
increase in the general cargo imports. Although the volume of general cargo
to be generated could not be accurately quantified, it has been taken into
account in the import projections.

22.       Overseas cargo in Samna-ri has been oscillating bet-veen 16,000 and
20,000 tons over the past three year;., and coastal c&r:.o bet;-,Tee-. 1,CI00
and 23,000 tons;  total cargo throug'-iput doar-ng th_. p'eod is aliouX 38-O00
tons. Laport projections are based on the average of thie past three years.
A growth rate of 5  up to 175 has been adopted, in the light of develop-
ments envisaged, but after 1975, a growth rate of 10% is foreseen. The
export growth rate is expected to be 6% up to 1975 ard 10% up to 1980/81
as against NEDECOs 7% p.a. on average.  Although NEDECO's coastal traffic
projection of 5% xras adcpted, it is considered conservative.

Rationale of Economic Evaluation
1.        The economic evaluation is based on a comparison of the situation
which would prevail if the proposed works are not underta1:en and the situa-
tion which  nould prevail after these work:s are completed - the "with" and
"1without" analysis.  It is, howover, assumed that congesti-on in a port
would not grow indefinitely, for, beyond a certain point, either cargo rill
divert to other alternative ports, if any exist, or, if none exist, will
stop increasing. No attempt has been made to estimate the economic costs
of the latter. 'Nhere traffic growth is arrested for lack of alternative
ports, the growth in benefits is assumed to stop; where traffic can be
diverted, because a reasonable alternative is available, the cost of diver-
sion would be estimated for the traffic likely to be diverted and such
costs counted as part of the benefits of the project.
2.        The alternatives to the proposed works at the four ports would
involve equal or greater amounts of investments at other ports, and in
addition over:land or coastal transportation costs as recurring cost.  These
are, therefore, not meaningful alternatives.  Alternatives to the project
as a whole would also involve both higher capital and operating costs.
3.        The extent of present and future ship waiting time as a function
of existing and piroposed capacity and expected traffic growth has been
evaluated with the use of a mathematical model developed by the Association.
Savings in ship time in port were calculated by using the following values
for a ship/day in port:  foreign general cargo ships, US$2,500;  tankers,
US$2,50O; and coasters, US$500, Present value of an average ship/day is
estimated at US$,0500/day in Port Moresby, Lae and Kieta, and US$1,000/day in
Alotau/Samarai, the last port servicing a larger proportion of coasters.
4,        Benefits from savings in ship time at berth are based on the
handling rates (tons per ship/day) given in Chapter 6. The costs of cargo
handling are estimated to approximate US$2/ton in Port Noresby and Lae,
US$3/ton in Kieta, and US$4/ton in Samarai.  Savings in cargo-handling costs
are assumed to vary in proportion to the savings in ship service time.
5.       M4ost of the labor used in cargo-handling activities is either
skilled (expatriate foremen, supervisors etc.) or semiskilled (indigenous
foremen, truck drivers, winchmen etc.).  The stevedores carry out fairly
extensive training programs for their employees and consider a trained
man highly valuable and worth at least his pay. Savings in labor are,
therefore, for the greater part, an economic benefit to the country.

1.        Present log production in the Milne Bay district is about 1.5
million su ft per annum. The forest areas in MAilne Bay cover 370,000
acres and are estimated to contain at least one billion su ft of saleable
timber, 1/3 to 2/5 of which is expected to be exported through Alotau.
Calculating on a 35-year growth basis, log production in the area may
reach at least 30 million su ft by 1980, of which  hcu!u 12 million su ft
may be exported through Alotau.
Present value of log output is approximately A$ 30/1,000 su ft or
A'P. P 100 ,pc,r tor.
Average distance to port by truck - 50 miles.
Average truck transport costs - A$ 0.08 x 50    - A$ 4/ton.
Allowing for empty backhaul, inlanid transport costs average
A^ 8/ton,
Other economic costs, soine A$ 2-3/1,000 su ft, or A$ 8/ton.
Net output value of logs is A$ 5h/ton.
Assuming thau half of the timber would not have been exported
unless a port is ccnstructed in Alotau, the benefits generated by the
constructiGn of the port in 1980 are:
.4 - (1.2 rillior    3    =     10 co.
2   1,000
This benefit is assumed to grow as follows:
1975                $25,000
1976                 50,°000
1977                 75,000
1978                100,000
1979                125,000
1980                150,000

2.        lTegative benefits (costs) consist of the economic consequences
accruing from the removal of overseas shUps from Samarai. The value of
the present investments in Samarai may be sev at A$ 4 millJJon, the economic
life of which (excluding port facilities) is 20 years according to the
consultants.  At an interest rate of 10%, the aLnnual value amounts to
~2.pproiitel" r  X 50L00.  The present port will, however, continue as a
coastal port, and since other activities such as tourism, schools, com-
munications etc. are expected to develop further, only one-third of the
existing investments in Samarai may be considered a total economic loss.

Simnlation of Port, Activities - Lae
A siP2lationl study was carried out in Lae to evaluate the economics
of the port development. The basic assumptions are as follows-
(a)  Traffic will increase by 10% p.a.
(b)  Average load per ship and port productivity will increase
to 1075 and from then on remain stable, leaving ship
service times fairly stable.
(c)  The number of ships ill- increase by 51O p.a. up to 1975.
Thereafter the number of ships will increase in proportion
to traffic (average load constant),
(d)  Average costs of ships:
US$
(1)  Unitized ships                     2,500/day
(2)  Break bulk ships                   25500/day
(3) Tankers                             2, 500/day
(1h)  Coasters, general cargo             500/day
(e)  Ship productivity 1971:                 Tons/honir
(1) Unitized ships                          60
(2)  Break bulk ships                       20
(3)  Tankers                                &0
(4)  Coasters                               10
(f) Berth reservations for unitized ships carrying 85% or more
ulitized cargo.
On the above basis, the following conclusions can be drawn:
(i) The project is already overdue. Assuming that the project
were finished in 1971/72, US$523,000/year in ship waiting
time would be saved,



A'J\AX 10
Page 2
(ii)  It is economical, on the basis of present traffic, to
construct separate coaster and tanker berths.  The con-
struction of a separate coaster berth would save
US$142,500/year, and the construction of a separate tanker
berth would save US$189,200/year in ship waiting time.
(iii) The project will be sufficient to handle projected traffic
up to 1981/52, At that time estimated waitirg times will
approach present levels,
(iv)  If traffic is 10% greater than projected, the project will
only be sufficient to serve traffic up to 1976/790 A 10%
traffic increase would happen if the anticipated diversion
of traffic to M4adang does not occur0
(v)  The standard deviation of waiting times is very large.
Some ships do not wait at all, while otlers wait far
