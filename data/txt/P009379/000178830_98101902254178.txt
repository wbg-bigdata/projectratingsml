REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the equiva-
lent of US$7.5 million on standard IDA terms to finance a Technical Assis-
tance project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A Basic Economic Report on Bangladesh, entitled "Bangladesh:
Development in a Rural Economy" (Report No. 455b-BD dated September 15,
1974) was distributed to the Executive Directors on October 1, 1974. This
was followed by an updating report entitled "Bangladesh:   The Current
Economic Situation and Short-Term Outlook" (Report No. 710a-BD, dated
May 2, 1975) distributed on May 5, 1975.   An economic mission was in the
field during November and December 1975, to assess progress made since the
updating report w;1s written. The mission's report is expected to be avail-
able for distribu,:ion shortly. Annex I contains country data sheets.
Background
3.        The Basic Economic Report describes the obstacles to development
in Bangladesh and outlines a course of action to maximize the country's
limited development prospects. The high ratio of population to natural
resources, the slow development of the productive and infrastructural base
and the weakness of the administrative and institutional framework led the
Report to project a growth rate of GDP of between 2% and 3.5% per year in
real terms over the five years 1973-78, the variation within that range
depending on the appropriateness of the policy framework and on levels of
aid.
4.        Encouraging progress was made in the period immediately following
Bangladesh's independence as an enthusiastic Government, supported by mas-
sive external assistance, strove to overcome the devastation of the cyclone
of 1970 and the struggle for independence in 1971. Large amounts of food
aid were distribut:ed, refugees were resettled and vital port, road and
rail facilities were brought back into operation. A new constitution was
adopted, and the i-irst national elections, held in March 1973, brought
Sheik Mujibur Rahnian's Awami League party into power with an overwhelming
parliamentary majority.
5.        But economic progress since independence has been inadequate.
Agricultural outpuit remains insufficient for a population growing at 3%
a year. Industrial output, heavily dependent on imports, has been badly

affected by scarcity of foreign exchange. State enterprises have been
hampered by management deficiencies, excessive government controls, short-
ages and price regulation. Exports have been stagnant and barely finance a
quarter of import needs. Bangladesh has been severely affected by an adverse
shift in its terms of trade since 1973. It's trade problems are compounded by
dependence on annual food imports of 1-2 million tons, even in years of favor-
able weather, and by heavy reliance on imported industrial raw materials.
Government revenue has been insufficient to meet current and development
expenditure needs. Bangladesh has had to depend on large flows of external
assistance to meet the wide gap between national output and expenditure.
6.        On August 15, 1975 a military coup ousted the government of Mujibur
Rahman replacing him as President with Khondaker Mushtuque Ahmed, formerly
Minister of Commerce and Foreign Trade. However, events beginning on November
3, 1975 culminated in further political changes. President Ahmed resigned in
favor of a former Chief Justice of Bangladesh, A.S.M. Sayem. Martial law is
in effect countrywide, with the new President serving as Chief Martial Law
Administrator. The three chiefs of the defense services are serving as Deputy
Chief Martial Law Administrators. The three Deputy Martial Law Administrators
and seven civilians have been appointed to form a President's Advisory Council
and each of the members has a responsibility for one or more ministries.
The new government has confirmed that it intends to introduce economic reforms
such as subsidy reduction, agricultural taxation and import liberalization.
Whatever its longer-term objectives and orientation might be, however, the
fundamental problems of the country, namely over-population, weak adminis-
tration, inadequate infrastructure and insufficient reserves continue to
confront Bangladesh.
Current Economic Picture
7.        Given this background of fundamental weaknesses in economic struc-
ture, inadequate economic progress since independence and political instabil-
ity, Bangladesh's economic situation requires persistent efforts at efficient
economic planning and implementation. On July 1, 1975, Bangladesh initiated
an economic stabilization program in conjunction with a standby arrangement
with the IMF. Its principal elements consisted of a credit restraint program
and elimination of deficit financing combined with some import liberalization.
This was preceded by a devaluation of 58% in May 1975. The record so far is
that the credit restraint program has been a success: after an estimated rate
Df inflation of about 80% in 1974, prices declined by 10% in 1975. The Gov-
ernment has not merely avoided deficit financing, it has retired some of its
debts to the banking system. The import-licensing program has been relaxed
in the first half of 1975/76; besides increasing allocations to an average of
95% of entitlements, licenses have been renewed on expiry and there is greater
fungibility in the use of exchange allocations for selected categories of im-
ports.



- 3 -
8.        The view has been expressed that at the beginning of 1975/76 the
credit restrictions had been too pervasive and insufficiently selective;
jute purchases by trading corporations had been hampered, productive
credit had been scarce, and import allocations could not be utilized.
Mea-ures have been talken to rectify this situation. Overall, however,
the impact of tlhc credit restraint program on the reduction of the rate
of inflationl has been salutary. It has been reinforced by other factors:
(a)  FavorabLe rice lharvests.  The current Ainan rice harvest
is expected to amount to 7-7.5 milliLon tons and output
for 1975/76 may be abouit 13 nilion Ltons, representing
an increase of about 17X over 1974/73. Rice harvests in
West Bengal lhave also been exceptionally good and prices
have been declining rapidly there.
(b) The border with India is being policed intensively and
smuggling has virtually ceased.
(c) The supply position for raw materials has improved during
1975/76. Larger import allocations have been boosted by
substantial declines in the prices of key imports.
(d) Capacity utilization and output has increased in a number
of industries and inventories of finished goods are higher.
9.        The devaluation has enabled a reduction in the price of raw jute
exports from the unrealistic level of E200 per ton (late 1974 and early 1975)
to E150 per ton (from July 15, 1975), f.o.b. Chittagong. This has led to an
increase in sales of raw jute. Overall, however, export earnings from manu-
factured jute goods are likely to fall in 1975/76 because the large decline
in export prices has not been compensated by an increase in export volume.
The problem is especially acute for jute manufactures because of the inter-
national economic recession, and because of increased competition from India
which has reduced tariffs for some products and provided export subsidies
for others. Bangladesh's non-traditional exports have derived benefits from
the devaluation and as a result total exports may be expected to pick up in
the course of 1975/76. The total value of merchandise exports is expected to
be about $350 million in 1975/76 compared to about $400 million in 1974/75.
On the import side, improvements are noticeable in the licensing program, but
import procedures continue to be complicated. In spite of recent measures to
reduce the role of the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh it continues to
monopolize a substantial part of the import business. It is estimated that
about 1.6 million tons of food valued at about $358 million (including ship-
ping) will be imported in 1975/76. Sizeable imports of edible oil, cement,
cotton, yarn, fertilizers and raw materials are also indicated. The total
value of merchandise imports is expected to approximate $1,286 million in



- 4 -
1975/76, but import payments are likely to approach $1,420 million due to
retirement of outstanding letters of credit from 1974/75.
10.       For the first time since independence, the availability of external
resources was not a binding constraint on the Bangladesh economy in 1975/76.
The year began with a relatively high level of foreign exchange reserves
($265 million). Aid, bolstered by the agreement with the International
Monetary Fund, continued to be at a high level. Excluding IMF assistance
($106 million), the commitment of foreign aid in 1975/76 was about $945 mil-
lion, about two-thirds of which was in the form of food and commodities aid.
The level of aid disbursement in 1975/76 (including IMF assistance) is ex-
pected to be about $1,011 million. In 1976/77 it is estimated that approxi-
mately $950 million of aid disbursements will be required.
11.      The agricultural sector continues to be beset with problems.     The
small-scale irrigation program (comprising low-lift pumps, shallow and deep
tubewells) has fallen short of its target; procedures for the allocation of
fertilizer continue to be unsatisfactory, and credit is insufficient and
inadequately distributed. Because of the steep fall in the free market
price, Government procurement of rice has increased dramatically and over
270,000 tons were procured by early February. Farmers are however still
hampered by the low moisture content requirements and the unfamiliar payment
procedures. This has led to farmers selling their paddy at prices below
the procurement price. This helps alleviate the Government's budget and
storage problems but undermines the basic purpose of the Government procure-
ment program which is to provide a floor price for rice. Storage facilities
for foodgrain (800,000 tons) have been almost exhausted and problems arising
from exposure of foodgrains to the elements are beginning to be of some
significance. The Government is considering phasing imports of foodg:ains,
though its objective is to have a stock of one million tons; in the meantime,
efforts are being made to rehabilitate approximately 200,000 tons of derelict
storage capacity.
12.      In the industrial sector capacity utilization has improved in a
number of industries, especially fertilizer, and the supply of raw material
and spares is more stable. But stocks remain unsold in the case of a
number of consumer products primarily due to inflexible pricing policies;
production of the wrong assortment (e.g. in textiles); competition from
imports under the Wage Earners' Scheme; and a reduction in consumer
liquidity (partly as a result of dissaving that occurred during the pre-
ceding three years of inflation). With a few exceptions, public enter-
prises are still generally deficient in management and labor productivity,
and lack autonomy in the matter of staffing and pricing policies.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BANGLADESH
13.      After Bangladesh became a member of the Bank and IDA in August,
1972, Bank group operations in Bangladesh concentrated initially on re-
activation of IDA credits for uncompleted projects financed under credits
to Pakistan before the independence of Bangladesh. Eleven such credits
in an aggregate amount of US$151.35 million (including US$44.1 million for
the repayment of amnounts that had been disbursed under the corresponding
previous credits to Pakistan) have been made to Bangladesh.     In addition,
13 new credits have been maae totalling US$424.2 million.     Of these US$275.0
million have been for program credits.    The project credits have emphasized
agricultural development, but also included amounts for population, tele-
communications and transport.   In October 1975 Bangladesh applied for
membership in IFC.   The Board of Governors have since passed a resolution
approving this appLication and Bangladesh is expected to become a member
soon.
14.      The debt service ratio in 1974/75 was 15.9 percent.     For 1975/76,
the ratio is estimated at nearly 20 percent. Negotiations are underway
between the Government of Bangladesh and the various bilateral and multila-
teral donors concerning the assumption by Bangladesh of a portion of the debt
contracted by Pakistan before Bangladesh became independent. Bangladesh's
debt service ratio is therefore expected to increase further in the coming
years. With respeci: to the Bank Group, Bangladesh has agreed to accept liabi-
lity fi%r certain debt for projects visibly located in Bangladesh and comple-
ted before independence. Agreements for a consolidation loan of about
US$54.9 million and a consolidation credit of about $31.0 million (based on
January 1, 1960 exchange rate) were signed on February 14, 1975. The Bank
Group's share of Bangladesh's outstanding external debt is not expected to
rise significantly over the next few years.
15.       Bangladesh's severe balance of payments difficulties require that
increac2d amounts cf aid be given in a flexible, fast disburzcalg fashion.
Program lending should therefore remain a feature of IDA assistance. For
the next several years the requirements of existing productive capacity
wilL remain high for the types of goods - spares, components and raw
materials - financEd by IDA program credits.    However, long-term improve-
ment in the Bangladesh economy can be expected only if sound policies,
programs, and development projects are pursued.     Thus, projects of the
highest priority must also be supported. Given its low per capita income,
Bangladesh's investment requirements cannot be met entirely from local
resources. In view of Bangladesh's difficult foreign exchange position,
IDA Credits should cover all foreign exchange costs. Taking into account
the level of financing expected to be available from other external lenders,
and in order to direct IDA lending to those sectors (such as agricultural
and rural development) where the percentage of foreign exchange costs is
relatively low, the financing of local currency expenditures is also
justified.



- 6 -
16.      Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits and the Bank
loan made to Bangladesh as of February 29, 1976 and notes on the status of
execution of ongoing projects.   After an initial slow start, disbursement
performance under the program credits has been good, keeping pace with the
estimates made during appraisal.   In contrast, disbursements under project
credits have lagged far behind expectations. Reasons for this include prob-
lems associated with release of local funds, clearance of contracts, employ-
ment of consultants and appointment of needed staff. The Government of
Bangladesh is aware of what the bottlenecks are and has taken steps recently
aimed at eliminating the most pressing of them and speeding up the imple-
mentation of projects, especially foreign aided projects. The release of
local funds for projects to semi-autonomous government agencies now re-
quires one application per year instead of the previous disruptive require-
ment of quarterly applications. The approval of the President is no longer
required for contracts and the ceiling for contracts which can be approved
directly by the project implementing agencies has been raised from Taka
700,000 to Taka 10 million. The requirement that the President approve
all consultant's contracts has been waived. The responsibility now devolves
upon the parent ministries of project agencies to approve the appointment
of consulting firms for projects with National Economic Committee approval,
or for project preparation activities. Finally, in the area of appointment
of staff recent changes require the Establishment Division and the Ministry
of Finance to issue specific instructions making the authorization of the
appointment of staff automatic in the case of approved projects.
17.      Long-term improvement in the Bangladesh economy can be expected
only if sound policies, programs and development projects are pursued.
The Association recognizes the prime importance of the agricultural sector
and of efforts to close Bangladesh's food gap. In this connection the Popu-
lation, Ashuganj Fertilizer and Barisal Irrigation Projects as well as the
Karnafuli Irrigation Project which was recently approved, all fit into the
strategy of increasing food production and reducing the food gap in the
future. In other sectors, several studies supported by the Association--for
example in industry and transportation (also assisted by the United Kingdom)
--should help the Government and the Association to develop a suitable pipe-
line of projects consonant with mutual assessment of economic priorities.
Further economic studies will be oriented to the same goal. In the indus-
trial field the Association and the Government of Bangladesh have been
working together in connection with our program credits to develop and agree
on action programs for strengthening the efficiency of the most important
sub-sectors. Finally, technical assistance will continue to be used as a tool
to improve project preparation and implementation capabilities.
PART III - THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
18.      In recognition of the need to strengthen its economic planning
machinery, the Government of Bangladesh recently decided that planning cells
be set up within all Development Ministries during the 1975/76 financial
year. This is intended to enable these ministries which are responsible



for the identification and preparation of projects within their respective
sectors to make a more effectLve contribution to planning at the national
level. While this in itself is a welcome development which should improve
project preparatlon, there is still a continuing need for external tech-
nical assistance boLh in establishing these cells and in the identification
and preparation of projects until these cells become fully effective.
19.      In recognition of Bangladesh's need for support in its efforts
at improving project planning and implementation, the Association provided
a $4 million Technical Assistance Credit (Credit 409-BD) in fiscal year
1973. These funds have been used primarily for the preparation of feasibJiity
studies and design and engineering work required for the preparation of pro-
jects for financing by IDA. In addition, some furnds have also been used to
assist in the strengthening of institutLons responsible for project planning
and implementation (through management assistance or studies of bottlenecks
impedLng project execution), for more general studies required prior to the
preparation of specific projects and for preparation of projects which may be
financed by other agencies. Initially, utiLizatLon of the credit was slower
than expected because the Government was reluctant to use consultants and this
necessitated an extension of the closing date for two years. The rate of
utilization has improved over the last year and it is expected that as a
result by the end of fiscal year 1976, this credit will have been fully
committed; hence the need for funding a second technical assistance project
which will permit a conLinuation of the types of activities carried out under
the auspices of the first credLt. The following table shows commitments to
date against this credLt and subprojects being considered for approval.

20.       The Ashuganj Fertilizer Project (Credit 527-BD) and several Proj-
ects being considered for possible future financing by IDA have benefited
from preparatory work carried out under the first Technical Assistance Credit.
For example the Rural Development Project scheduled for FY 76 and the Inland
Water Transport and Muhuiri Irrigation Projects scheduled for FY 77 are all
based in part on work performed or being performed by consultants financed
under Credit 409-BD. The average foreign exchange cost per man-month for
salaries and overhead for foreign consultants employed under credit 409-BD
has been about $5,400.
21.      While bilatera:L agencies and the UNDP are expected to continue
providing much of Bangladesh's requirements for technical assistance, the
levels of need are beyond what can be expected from these agencies over
the next two years. It is therefore necessary for IDA to continue lending
for technical assistance, especially since this has proved to be essential
for the total lending program. It improves the project pipeline not only



- 9 -
for IDA financing but also for financing by other donors. In addition to the
credit, proposals are being discussed for provision of additional technical
assistance funds through a UNDP "Umbrella Project", with IDA as the executing
agency. This project is unlikely to commence before 1977/78.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.      A Credit and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.    The funds
from the proposed credit would be allocated to specific subprojects by
mutual agreement between the Government and the Association.    The credit
funds would be used primarily for feasibility studies and other investi-
gations required for preparing projects for financing by the Association.
The proceeds would also be used for strengthening institutions responsible
for project planning and implementation (through the provision of management
assistance or staff training), for more general studies which may be required
prior to the preparation of specific projects, and for the preparation of
projects for financing by other agencies. Special emphasis would be placed
upon staff training programs designed to improve Bangladesh's project prep-
aration capacity.
23.      While the Specific uses of the funds have not been identified in
detail, it is expecl:ed that as with the first credit the emphasis will be
on sub-projects in che field of agriculture and water resources development,
the two sectors which are considered so crucial to Bangladesh's overall
development strategy. As regards other sectors, technical assistance will
be needed, for example: (a) for the establishment of effective planning cells
within the development ministries; (b) for the improvement of Bangladesh's
statistical service!s; and (c) for improving the managerial capacity in
public corporations in the industrial sector. Additional requirements
for assistance are expected to emerge, either from the Government's own
work or as the resuLt of sector surveys, such as the proposed Industrial
Sector Mission in FY77.
24.      The selection of consultants, their terms of reference and the
final contract between the Government and the consultants would be subject
to agreement between Government and the Association. The Association would
also provide assistance to the Government in supervising the work of the
consultants. ConsuLtants' terms of reference would emphasize the importance
of training local sraff so as to reduce the need for foreign assistance as
rapidly as possible. The Ministry of Planning of the Government of Bangladesh
would be responsible for ensuring effective coordination of the various
Government ministries and agencies concerned in the implementation of the
project.



- 10 -
25.       It is expected that most of the technical assistance would be pro-
vided by foreign consultants. However, the Association supports the Govern-
ment's desire to use qualified local consultants to the largest degree pos-
sible, either independently or in collaboration with foreign firms. In the
first Technical Assistance Credit (409-BD) the Association agreed to pay 100
percent of the foreign exchange expenditure incurred by foreign consultants,
and 70 percent of the total costs of services rendered by local consultants.
However, in order that the percentage used for foreign and local consultants
would be the same, the proposed financing formula has been modified. The
proposed credit would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs and 70
percent of local currency costs of consultants, whether foreign or local and
whether hired directly or as subconsultants. Credit funds would also be
available by agreement between the Government and the Association, for
financing the cost of trips by Government personnel to work with consultants
at their home office, overseas training, and the foreign exchange cost of such
material and equipment required for approved technical assistance subprojects
as may be procured directly by the Government.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
26.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's Republic
of Bangladesh and the Association, the recommendation of the committee refer-
red to in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Asso-
ciation, and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Development
Credit Agreement follows substantially the form of the first Technical Assist-
ance Credit Agreement.
27.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
28.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -/
Cr. No. 339    Cyclone Area Reconstruction Project; US$25.0 Million Credit
of October 18, 1972; Effective Date:   January 17, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
Implementation of the original project, financed under Credit No.
228-PAK of 1971, had not commenced prior to the suspension of disbursements.
The repair work on damaged port terminal buildings has been completed and re-
pairs of landing facilities are expected to be completed in mid 1976. Contracts
have been signed for all equipment component of the telecommunications sys-
tem. Earthwork has 'been completed for about 50% of primary roads, and
70 cyclone shelters are under construction or complete. Activation of the
cyclone warning system is expected soon. Progress was slow initially due
in part to administrative delays and the severe shortages of construction
materials in Bangladesh. Construction materials are now available, progress
has improved somewhat. Project completion is expected to be about two years
behind the schedule anticipated at appraisal. In June 1974, the Government
submitted to the Association a proposal for reducing the scope of the project
in order to cope with the sharp increase in construction costs since the
Project was appraised. The proposal involved reductions in the feeder roads
to be financed by the Credit (financing for these roads has been obtained from
the World Food Program), reductions in the fisheries subproject, and minor
reductions in other project items. Given the very early stage of procurement
under the project, it was decided not to formally amend the project at that
stage, and it was agreed that the Government's proposals for reducing the
project provided a reasonable basis for proceeding for the time being. A revised
proposal from the Government based upon revised cost estimates, concerning
the amendments required in the project description and allocation of the amounts
of the credit to each subproject has just been received and is under review.
Cr. No. 340    Chandpur Irrigation II Project:   US$13.0 Million Credit of
October 18, 1972: Effective Date:   JanuaryJ1   1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Project is far behind schedule and continues to be plagued with
problems. Major flooding, work stoppages caused by 100% increase in con-
struction labor costs, shortages of cement, fuel, and operable construction
equipment, ineffective management, inadequate provision of local funds and
general inflation are factors which have delayed project construction. There
is some improvement in construction recently. Outstanding contractor claims
have recently been resolved. Manufacture of the electrical and mechanical
equipment for the regulators and pumping plant has been completed, and
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress oE projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

delivery is being made to the sites. Delays in finalizing the low-lift
pump specifications by WDB retarded procurement. Tenders have now been
issued. Continuing inflation and other adverse factors are expected to
increase the Project costs substantially over the appraisal estimate.
Cr. No. 341    Tubewells Project; US$14.0 Million Credit of November 6, 1972;
Effective Date: January 13, 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1976
This project was originally financed by IDA Credit No. 208-PAK of
1970 and credits from Sweden and Canada. Although bids had been received in
1971, no contracts were awarded before Bangladesh independence. The present
Credit is again in conjunction with a Credit from Sweden and a grant from
Canada. Construction on this project began during January 1974. In April
1974, IDA approved award of the contract for supply of the well pumps and
engines. Due to initial delays, present implementation is about 18 months
behind schedule. In January 1974, the Government and the engineering con-
sultants signed a revised contract providing for the additional engineering
and agriculture consulting services needed for the project. In February
1974, the agricultural consultants (who were under sub-contract to the engineer-
ing consultants) withdrew from the project, stating that the salary scales
in the revised contract signed by the engineering consultants were inadequate
to attract staff of the calibre required for the project. Proposals to replace
the agricultural consultants and expand their activities have been agreed
in principle by the Government, and the financing of the additional agricultural
consultant costs is currently under consideration by a bilateral aid agency.
Drilling of the tubewells has progressed satisfactorily in the past construc-
tion.
Cr. No. 343    Telecommunications Project: US$7.3 Million Credit of November 15,
1972; Effective Date: January 17, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978 -
The project was originally financed as part of Credit No. 145-PAK
of 1969, and goods and services valued at about US$2.2 million were received
in Dacca prior to suspension of disbursements. Three out of the four micro-
wave systems in the Project are under installation and are scheduled to be
commissioned by March 1976, and about one year behind schedule. The fourth
system is a replacement of a coaxial cable system in the original project.
This change was agreed to by IDA and was caused by price increases demanded
by the original contractor which made the choice of a microwave system more
economical. The bid invitation for this sytem has been included with the
bids that have already been invited for other microwave systems under
Credit 487-BD. Even so, the system is scheduled to be commissioned in
late 1977 or early 1978. The Closing Date for this Credit has been extended
from December 31, 1975 to June 30, 1978.

Cr. No. 353    Small-Scale Industry Project; US$3.0 Million Credit of
January 19, 1973; Effective Date: May 14, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The Project was originally financed by IDA Credit No. 192-PAK
of 1970. The Credit has financed notional repayment of amounts previously
disbursed under Credit No. 192-PAK (US$187,000) and payment of outstanding
amounts for consulting services performed under Credit No. 192-PAK (US$12,000).
Disbursements for new activities up to January 31, 1976 amounted to approximately
US$2.4 million. The balance amount available is expected to be disbursed
during 1976. A UND'/UNIDO technical assistance project has made some limited
progress toward the reorganization of BSIC.
Cr. No. 367    Chittagong Water Supply Pro ect; US$7.0 Million Credit of
Aprl 9, 1973; Effective Date: June 7, 1973
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project was originally financed by IDA Credit No. 42-PAK under
which US$3.3 million was disbursed. The work has progressed at a slow rate,
but will improve now that several civil works contracts are under way. Phys-
ical progress had been curtailed by lack of cement, slow delivery of pipe,
and slow preparation of designs and contract documents. While the immediate
requirements for pipe and cement are on hand, several supply and construc-
tion contracts are yet to be tendered. WASA has been requested to hasten
the preparation of contract documents and the tendering for this work. Man-
agement, labor and union problems are now being better addressed following
the appointment of the new Chairman. W4hile collection performance has im-
proved, financial operations and financial management remain weak. The Gov-
ernment has increased the water rates by 50 percent effective July 1, 1975.
However, unless the performance in billing and collection improves and leak-
age is reduced, further rate increases would be necessary to meet the finan-
cial covenants of the Credit Agreement. The Association has agreed to extend
the Closing Date by one year to June 30, 1976. At that time a decision will
be made, based upon the progress over the year in meeting the financial cov-
enants, as to whether or not to extend the Closing Date for the additional
1 to 1-1/2 years required to complete the project.
Cr. No. 368    Dacca Water and Sewerage Project; US$13.2 Million Credit of
April_91L973; Effective Date:    June 7, 1973
Closing Date: June 30,_1976
The project was originally financed by IDA Credit No. 41-PAK of
1963. By December 1971, when disbursements were suspended, US$6.0 million
had been disbursed. The work has progressed at a slow rate but will improve
now that several civil works contracts are under way and tubewell materials
and equipment have been delivered. Right-of-way acquisition and contractor
performance continue as major problems. Management and labor problems con-
tinue, and financial operations and the financial condition of the WASA
remains weak. The Covernment has increased the water rates by 50 percent,
effective July 1, 19I75. However, unless performance in billing and collec-
tion improves and leakage is reduced, further increases would be necessary

to meet the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement. The Association
has agreed to extend the Closing Date by one year to June 30, 1976. At that
time a decision will be made, based upon the progress over the year in meet-
ing the financial covenants, as to whether or not to extend the Closing Date
for the additional 1 to 1-1/2 years needed to complete the project.
Cr. No. 381    Foodgrain Storage Project; US$19.7 Million Credit of May 18,
1973; Effective Date: July 17, 1973;
Laosing Date: June 30, 1976
The project is also financed by a credit from the Kingdom of
Sweden of 25.0 million Kroner. The project was originally financed by
US$19.2 million IDA Credit No. 83 of 1966 and a 25 million Kroner credit
from the Kingdom of Sweden. The project was almost completed at the time
of Bangladesh's independence and 95% of the present IDA and Swedish credits
were used for repaying the previous credits. The remaining funds (US$1.25
million from IDA and about US$0.25 million equivalent from Sweden) are being
used to pay outstanding bills for work completed prior to the war, comple-
tion of some supporting facilities for the grain storage silos, replacement
of spares and equipment damaged during the war, and a feasibility study for
a second grain storage project. The designs for the jetty modifications have
been approved and we are awaiting receipt of proposed arrangements for con-
struction. The feasibility study for a second grain storage project was
completed in October 1975. Supervision missions have reported serious deterio-
ration in the silos mechanical equipment due to inadequate maintenance. The
management and staffing of the Directorate of the Silos is inadequate. Delays
in ordering spare parts (for which funds are available under the Credit)
increase the risk of breakdown. The Government has agreed interalia (i) to
employ consultants to improve foodgrain storage management, (ii) tc release
local funds required for ancillary civil works for the project, (iii) to fill
all managerial, technical, and administrative vacancies by June 30, 1976 and
(iv) to finalize the contract award for jetty construction by June 30, 1976.
Based upon these assurances the Association agreed that the Closing Date for
this Credit which had originally been December 31, 1974 be extended for a
second time from December 31, 1975 to June 30, 1976. The Government was
informed that any further extensions of the Closing Date required to complete
the project would be considered only if the Government has met its commitments
concerning steps to be taken to improve silo maintenance and operations.
Cr. No. 407    Education Project; US$21.0 Million Credit of June 29, 1973;
Effective Date: September 27, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project was originally financed by two IDA Credits 49-PAK and
98-PAK. By December 1971, when disbursements were suspended, US$7.7 million
had been disbursed out of the US$17.5 million aggregate total of the two
former credits. The Credit 407-BD added US$3.5 million to the total of the
orig-dal Ciedits, in order to help the Government meet part of the increases



ANNEX II
Page 7 of 11
in total project cost. Progress on the Agricultural University portion of
the project was delayed initially due to difficulties in reaching agreement
with the consultant architects on a revised contract. Construction has also
been delayed due to shortage of building material, delays in the preparation
of equipment lists, and furniture designs. The recent devaluation of the
Taka has considerab]y reduced the cost overruns. Without including price
and physical contingencies, the cost of the project is now estimated at 58%
over the appraisal estimates in Taka terms, but only 10% when expressed in
US dollar equivalent. The Government has submitted to IDA proposals for
modification of the project to meet the cost overrun. These proposals are
currently under review. Implementation is about 24 months behind the appraisal
schedule. Progress on the technical education portion of the project is
about 12 months behind the appraisal schedule. The graduates are facing
severe problems of tnemployment, and the curriculum needs revision to make
it more relevant to job requirements. The Government will be making recom-
mendations on the development plan of the Agricultural University shortly.
Cr. No. 408    Highways Project; US$25.0 Million of June 29, 1973;
Effective Date: September 27, 1973
Closi.ng Date:  December 31, 1977
The project was originally financed by IDA Credit No. 53-PAK. By
December 1971, when disbursements were suspended, US$3.62 million had been
disbursed, out of the original credit of US$22.5 million. The new credit
adds US$2.5 million to the original credit amount, in order to help the
Government meet part: of the increase in total project cost as a result of
currency realignment:s. Four construction contracts were signed in September
1973 for the Sitalakhya Bridge and the Feni Section of the Dacca/Chittagong
road worth about US'$9.2 million. A fifth contract with consultants for
construction superv lsion was signed in February 1974 but they were in the
field earlier. Shortage of spare parts, administrative delays and deficien-
cies in some contractors performance have delayed certain elements of the
project. Construction of the 1300-foot bridge over the Sitalakhya River
previously on schedule is now likely to be completed two years behind
schedule, in mid-19;8 due to technical difficulties compounded by poor
contractor performance. However, the twenty-mile Feni bypass road construc-
tion project is weli. on the way to completion, and plans for paving the road
are now under preparation. The estimated cost of civil works has increased
by about 60%, in line with worldwide trends. However, the total overall
project cost increase is considerably less, being about 25%. Disbursements,
which in the past have been slow, show signs of improvement.
Cr. No. 409    Techlical Assistance Project; US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1973; Effective Date: August 20, 1973;
Closji.ng Date:  December 31j 1977
After a s:Low start, the Government has recently begun to take
advantage of the funds available under this credit for preinvestment plan-
ning, feasibility studies and technical assistance for agencies involved in

project planning and implementation. Contracts have been signed with con-
sultants for seven projects with an allocation from this Credit of about $1.3
million. These studies have played a key role in the preparation of the
Ashuganj Fertilizer Project and three other projects which are under con-
sideration for FY76 and FY77. Another six subprojects involving $2.3 mil-
lion of credit funds have been recently approved and arrangements for selec-
tion of consultants are underway. Credit funds are expected to be fully
committed by June 30, 1976, but some of the studies financed will take up
to two years to complete. The Closing Date for this Credit has been extended
from December 31, 1975 to December 31, 1977.
Cr. No. 410    Cereal Seeds Project; US$7.5 Million Credit of June 29, 1973;
Effective Date: January 30, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project is about 20 months behind appraisal schedule. Follow-
ing a year of virtual stagnation, the Seed Certification Agency has been
established, seed legislation has been drafted and procurement of equipment
and construction of buildings has started. However, serious staffing, pro-
curement and financial problems remain. The Government has been trying to
obtain additional bilateral financing to help meet the cost overrun. However,
the Government has now agreed to proceed with the full project, and to meet
the full cost overrun if other financing does not become available. Mean-
while, recruitment of key personnel has been extremely slow due to the lengthy
procedures required by the Government; appointments are required in particu-
lar for the head of the Seed Certification Agency and for the general manager
(field) of Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC). A full-
time official in charge of coordination in the Ministry of Agriculture has
just been designated. Procurement of farm machinery has been held up because
of the bidders' failure to comply with tender specifications and by the
Government's unsuccessful efforts thereafter to arrange for bilateral finan-
cing.
Cr. No. 424    Inland Water Transport Rehabilitation Project; US$8.7 Million
Credit of August 10, 1973; Effective Date: September 27,
1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Detailed investigations have indicated that the damage to the
Chittagong offshore oil terminal was more severe than previously believed.
Consultants were appointed late in 1973 to study several alternative tech-
nical solutions. An Amending Agreement modifying the project description,
in line with the consultants' recommendations, and increasing the amount of
the credit from US$4.1 million to US$8.7 million was approved by the Execu-
tive Directors on September 16, 1975. The Amending Agreement became effective
on March 19, 1976. The procurement of spare parts, tools and equipment for the
Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority, Bangladesh Inland Water Trans-
port Corporation, Chittagong Port Trust and Bangladesh Engineering and Ship-
ping Corporation suffered from initial delays, reflecting in part the lack



ANNEX II
Page q nf 1j
of familiarity of the agencies with IDA procedures and slowness in reaching
decisions as to which spare parts had highest priority. Progress has now
improved and it is expected that all orders will be placed by early 1976.
Disbursements for this portion of the project are expected to be completed
by June 30, 1976, one year later than originally anticipated.
Cr. No. 458    Imports ProgTam; US$50 Million Credit of February 7, 1974;
Effective Date: February 7, 1974;
Closing Date:  March 31, 1976
By June 1974, licenses for the full amount of the credit had been
issued to the various eligible industries. As of December 31, 1975, dis-
bursements amounted to US$48.0 million and, in addition letters of credit
guaranteed by IDA had been opened for US$1.0 million. Import orders have
been placed for the balance, and the credit is expected to be fully disbursed
by the Closing Date.
Cr. No. 487    Secondl Telecommunications Project; USS20.0 Million Credit of
June 26, 1974; Effective Date: July 23, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Credit became effective July 23, 1974. Procurement work is well
in hand with the major orders expected to be placed by March 1976. Local
telephone expansion lhas lagged about a year behind schedule due to slower
than expected deliveries from the local factory (hampered by labor unrest).
However, the factory production is now picking up and the shortfall in
project targets is expected to be made up by 1977. According to present
cost estimates, fore:Lgn costs are likely to be within the original estimates.
The local costs will increase from Tk 470 million to Tk 680 million due to
higher labor and construction costs and the imposition of a 20% tax on all
imported goods. Under the Credit Agreement, BTT is to establish a modern
accounting system and is to be transformed into a Board with adequate auton-
omy. Accounting consultants have been appointed. The Board was legally
established before the June 30, 1975 deadline, but the ordinance was revoked
almost immediately thereafter. A new ordinance establishing a Telecommunica-
tion Board was recently promulgated. We are waiting further information on
the regulations under which the new Board will operate.
Cr. No. 515    Third Imports Program; USS75 Million Credit of October 9,
1974; Effective Date:  October 10,_1974;
Closii Date: December 31, 1976
Provision was made to reimburse the Government for up to USS10 mil-
lion for eligible imports paid for after JUlY 1, 1974, but prior to the date
of the credit. Disbursements amounted to USS59.6 million as of December 31,
1975, and in addition letters of credit guaranteed by IDA amount to USS6.9
million. The Credit approved on October 9, 1974 was for US$50 million, but



ANNEX II
Page 10 of 11
after the Fourth IDA Replenishment Agreement became effective, an amendment
increasing the credit amount was approved on February 27, 1975. The Amend-
ing Agreement was signed on March 10, 1975 and became effective on April 7,
1975. The Government has allocated the full amount of the Credit among the
various eligible industries, and import orders are being processed. It is
expected that by March 1976 the bulk of disbursements would have taken
place.
Cr. No. 527    Ashuganj Fertilizer Project; US$33 Million Credit of
February 11, 1975; Effective Date: December 19, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
Project is being cofinanced by Asian Development Bank, KfW, and
the Governments of Iran, Switzerland, UK and US, providing a total of $109
million equivalent in addition to the IDA credit. Site preparation work is
proceeding on schedule, but, overall, the project is about six months behind
schedule due primarily to delays in awarding the General Engineering and
Management Assistance Contracts. These contracts were signed in late
November/early December and the firms are expected to commence work in
Bangladesh early in 1976. Commencement of commercial production is now
expected by February 1979.
Cr. No. 533    Population Project:   US$15 Million Credit of February 11,

Project is being confinanced by six co-lenders providing a total of
about $25 million equivalent in addition to the IDA credit. Notwithstanding
the delay in declaring the Credit effective, the Government has made substan-
tial progress in project implementation. The organizational structure of the
Population Control and Family Planning Division (body responsible for the
population program) has been defined and its staff is being placed in position.
The Population Program Officers, who are responsible for the population
programs of five non-health ministries, have been trained abroad and have
initiated the schemes of their respective ministries. A contract with
architectural consultants for the Building, Planning and Design Unit of the
Ministry of Health has been signed. The Government is proceeding with the
selection of required consultants and advisors for other parts of the project.
However, because of institutional problems, the implementation of a few project
components is some months behind schedule. In particular, the Government has
still to formally appoint a number of key personnel.
