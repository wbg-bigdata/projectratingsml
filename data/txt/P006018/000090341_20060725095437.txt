3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
        Background. The Second Provincial Development Project (PDP-II) supported stabilization and
adjustment efforts of the federal government directed towards more efficient provincial public sector
performance. After 1989, Argentina had implemented structural reforms that brought hyperinflation,
economic stagnation and public sector deficits under control. As a result, national growth rebounded in the
early 1990's and fiscal deficits were reduced. However, the government decided that it was critical to
expand these reforms to the provincial governments. In 1993, the provinces carried out roughly 40 percent
of public expenditures and 60 percent of public investment. Argentina is one of the most decentralized
countries in the world. Hence the authorities considered that their overall stabilization and adjustment
measures would have only limited success if the provincial governments did not follow the adjustment path
of the federal government.

        The Project was able to build on previous efforts. The First Provincial Development Program
(PDP-I) implemented in 1990 - 1997 was the federal government's attempt to enlist the provincial
governments in its reform campaign. With the support of the Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank, the federal authorities spearheaded an effort to spark changes in the provinces' overstaffing and poor
budgeting and accounting practices which resulted in inadequate fiscal performance and inefficient
spending.

        The objective of PDP-I aimed to address these problems by strengthening provincial
administrations so that they could better assume the responsibilities delegated to them. The underlying
aims were to raise revenues and tighten expenditure controls, emulating the complementary federal
adjustment measures. During this period, the provinces and the federal government negotiated several pacts
aimed at a complementary fiscal arrangement, but several of them were broken.

        In late 1994, the vulnerabilities of the Argentine economy and government finances grew more
evident. Foreign investors pulled out and depositors withdrew funds from most banks. Financial and
economic turbulence followed. Annual economic growth averaged 9.09 percent in 1990-1994. But in 1995,
the country had a negative growth rate of 3 percent. This adversely affected provincial finances as general
revenue-sharing fund transfers dropped sharply, leading to increasing subnational deficits. In 1995, the
overall provincial deficit was equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP. This development showed that the
provinces' finances had made important progress but that their fiscal reform was very incomplete.
Significantly therefore, Argentina's 1994 recession presented both the necessity to further pursue and
deepen subnational modernization and adjustment, as well as a timely political opportunity to implement
them (Figure 1).

               The Second Provincial Development Program (PDP-II) adopted in 1996 was designed in this
economic and political context. It aimed not only at sustaining and deepening reforms in some provinces
but also initiating them in others that lagged behind. PDP-I had shown that not all provinces were
successful in introducing reforms and sustaining adjustment. The massive increase in own-source revenues
and federal transfers as a result of the "Tanzi-effect" after stabilization, in addition to the political cost of
subnational adjustment, had limited incentives for the provinces' full commitment to the federal goals.
PDP-II thus was aimed at providing additional incentives for provinces to implement institutional
modernization and to improve fiscal performance.

               This intention was especially important as provincial governments had assumed larger roles as
service providers since 1990. Argentina's decentralization program further expanded this role by
encompassing services in health, education, security, water and sanitation, electricity and other sectors.
Most provinces, however, were ill-prepared to discharge this enlarged responsibility.

               Development Objective. PDP-II's specific objectives were that provinces would improve their
current account balances, strengthen their investment management capacities and promote their economic
development. The tools offered were twofold: first, institutional modernization for better fiscal management
in such key areas as tax administration, cadaster, human resources, and financial management. Second,
investment financing was provided for promoting provincial economic development through infrastructure
improvements (Table 1).

 Table 1. The Objectives of the Second Provincial Development Program

     Overall objective:
     Continue to provide financial support and incentives for provinces to
     undertake their own public sector modernization programs consistent with
     the national program.
     Specific objectives:
     (a) Assist   the   provinces   in    implementing    appropriate   financial
         management changes to:
         (i)     generate current account surpluses (own-revenue enhancement
                 and expenditure control) that together with prudent borrowing
                 may finance investment programs; and
         (ii)    strengthen their capacity to plan, program, finance, execute,
                 and monitor investment programs that are economically
                 efficient, financially sustainable, institutionally manageable,
                 and environmentally sound.
     (b) Provide financing for institutional development and physical
         investments that will promote provincial economic development.




        PDP-II's design supported the government's goal of stabilization and adjustment, as well as
addressed the need for increased productivity and competitiveness. Particularly after adopting the
Convertibility Law in 1991 and pegging the currency to the US dollar, Argentina's economy became more
vulnerable to sudden reversals of capital flows since wage and price inflexibilities under the fixed exchange
rate regime could exacerbate recessions. Therefore, the country became more dependent on the provincial
governments' efficient provisions of infrastructure services in order to enable Argentina to prosper in the
increasingly globalizing economic environment. The government consequently decided to undertake steps
directed at preventing further infrastructure deterioration and triggering greater regional economic
development.

         PDP-II was part of a large package of Bank assistance to the provinces for these purposes. The
Provincial Reform adjustment loan (PRL, Ln. 3836-AR) helped to provide a supportive macroeconomic
framework. It was responsible for introducing reforms conducive to subnational adjustment, through both
privatization (particularly of provincial banks) and institutional changes in provincial pension funds
(absorbed by the federal government).        In addition, municipal strengthening programs MDP I (Ln.
2920-AR) and MDP II (Ln. 3860-AR) sought to strengthen the capacities of municipalities to mobilize
resources for investments; to plan, finance, and execute capital investment programs; and to improve
resource management for improved services.

        Project Design. The project was a repeater, designed after the successful First Provincial
Development Project, which incorporated the lessons learned during the implementation of PDP-I. These
lessons were the following:

l First, the success of national fiscal adjustment programs depends on the ability of states/provinces to
    carry out similar reforms to encourage prudent fiscal behavior and operational efficiency in service
    delivery.
l Second, when possible, changes in the rules of game for intergovernmental relations such as strict
    eligibility criteria used in private markets (e.g., creditworthiness) or demand-driven sub-project

    identification should be embedded upstream, in the design of projects.
l Third, operations that support on-lending for multisectoral sub-projects place significant demands on
    central and provincial authorities as well as the Bank and its partners of coordination capacity and
    enforcement of minimum standards.
l Finally, multisectoral loans involving cadaster, property registry and tax administration projects should
    be implemented in an integrated manner with a special focus on sequencing.

         The loan was contracted by the federal government which on-lent resources to the provinces. The
provinces were to repay their sub-loans directly to the federal government.

         All the provinces were eligible to participate in the operation. As they were heterogeneous in their
needs, the project followed a demand-driven strategy. Provinces selected the institutional changes and
investments that best suited their priorities. The level of participation by provincial governments was high:
22 out of 24 Provinces (including the Buenos Aires Municipality) participated in the project.

         Provinces had to meet eligibility criteria to participate in the project. Approval by the Project's
Central Executing Unit (CEU) and the Bank of a province's Financial Action and Investment Plan (FAIP)
was required for the financing of any sub-project. The FAIP included the sub-project's institutional
arrangements and a specific action plan for: (a) maintaining a current account surplus; or (b) pursuing
revenue enhancement and/or expenditure reduction that would result in a current surplus during the FAIP's
implementation. There were also specific sub-project eligibility criteria. Public investment sub-projects
were eligible if they were: (a) listed in the Project Operational Manual as eligible; (b) included in an
approved FAIP; and (c) shown to be technically consistent, economically efficient, financially sustainable,
and environmentally sound according to the criteria defined in the Manual. To ensure proper coordination
and policy consistency between the proposed operation and other sector-specific projects at the provincial
level, the following rules applied:

(a)      In case there was already an effective, sector specific project with Bank financing with
uncommitted funds, a province was not able to receive additional financing through PDP-II.
(b)      Investment sub-projects needed to be consistent with Bank sector strategies.

In addition, financing was only provided to provinces which included all of their externally financed
sub-projects in a FAIP approved by the Secretariat for Assistance to the Provincial Economic Reform
(SAREP) of the Ministry of the Interior and the Bank.

         For components of physical investments, provinces had to also meet the following eligibility
criteria (because of concern over their impacts on the expenditure side, which could affect their fiscal
balances):
a)       Existence of a current account surplus in the balance of current revenues and current expenditures
during the last executed budget period.
b)       Total existing and proposed provincial debt could not result in a total debt service obligation
(amortization, interest, and other financial charges) greater than 15 percent of total provincial current
revenues (excluding discretionary grants).

         Also, all physical investments had to be in line with the Bank's sector strategies. However, it was
not the responsibility of PDP-II to promote sector-level reforms. First of all, instead, the ministries of the
provinces involved sent their proposals to the Provincial Executing Units (PEU). These units reviewed
them and assessed if they were in line with the provincial modernization plan. The PEUs also had to
submit to the Central Executing Units the FAIPs that were required to finance any sub-project. The CEU


                                                      - 5 -

evaluated the FAIPs and determined if they were technically consistent, economically efficient, financially
sustainable, and environmentally sound according to defined criteria. Also the CEU sector specialists
assessed each sub-project and gave their feedback to the provinces. As a result of that action, new
indicators were developed and incorporated into the FAIPs. The Bank's sector units, in turn, were to
evaluate each sub-project proposal for consistency with the government's strategy in that sector.

         On the Project's investment component, reforms in cadasters were to be financed by the Bank while
most of the reforms carried out in tax administration were to be financed by the IADB. The implementation
of these varied however. After the IADB loan closed in 1997, the Bank had to assume the responsibility for
the tax administration projects. By that time, most of the reforms in cadasters were considerably advanced
while many of the reforms in tax administration were delayed or implemented only partially.

         It is also important to bear in mind that the provincial public sector authorities during the economic
boom in the mid-1990's were not greatly concerned about increases in public expenditures. This lessened
the provinces´ interests in sub-projects related to financial management and human resources aimed at
improving efficiency in public expenditure.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives were not revised.

3.3 Original Components:
         There were two components:

(i)      The component on institutional development included technical assistance, training, and equipment
for the implementation of public administration reforms (42 percent of project costs). They centered on tax
administration, cadaster, financial management, and human resources reforms
(ii)     The component on physical investments emphasized service delivery improvements (51 percent of
project costs). This included, among others, the maintenance and rehabilitation of existing works, the
completion of unfinished works, and the construction of new public infrastructure and facilities. These
primarily pertained to education, health, and roads, but also included drainage, water supply, and other
services.

         An additional 7 percent of project funding was directed to the administrative expenses of project
coordination and implementation.

3.4 Revised Components:
The components were not revised.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
Rating:marginally Satisfactory.

         PDP-II's design was favorable in several important respects. Its objectives were consistent with
government priorities and CAS objectives. Its concepts and parameters were based on those for PDP-I
(which OED's review note on the project ICR commended for being innovative and successfully changing
the rules of the game). It was realistic and forward looking in its understanding of the capacities of the
implementing agencies. The design also proved to be successful in encouraging local ownership and broad
participation. It was, furthermore, useful in its complementarities with other IBRD-financed projects
directed at subnational reform.




                                                       - 6 -

      These advantages were, however, substantially offset by other factors. Most importantly, the project's
demand-driven process did not include adequate linkages between reforms and investments. While the
emphasis on ownership and commitment are crucial, the provision to the provinces of support for
infrastructure investment was not conditioned sufficiently to reform efforts. The project structure
combining the two strands also proved to be too complex.

      The project was also ambitious in supporting a wide range of reform areas. It offered support for
physical investments in too many sectors. This wide range taxed the capacities of both national and
provincial implementing units. An initially more focused approach would have been more suitable
(although some remedial changes were made early on). The project was also a challenge for the Bank as
there were too many clients and too many sub-projects in many areas, presenting a high demand on
specialists and requiring a high level of coordination among sectors, as well as on Bank supervision
budgets.

      There were other questionable design features. The Project's development objectives set outcomes
which its implementing agencies could not fully achieve. Nor did those objectives have defined results. The
monitoring indicators were not adequate because the project was demand-driven and there was not an
inventory of sub-projects available during appraisal. Therefore, the list of performance indicators did not
identify targets for monitoring (which may reflect the practices prevailing in the Bank at the time of
preparation). These weaknesses appeared to have deterred the definition of suitable objectives and
indicators for infrastructure investments, e.g., in education.

     In addition, there were some problems in the Bank's implementation of its tasks under the design. The
project's intentions for Bank sector units' reviews of physical investment proposals for verification of their
consistencies with sector policies were not always fulfilled, particularly regarding roads. It appears that: (a)
sub-projects in this area may have been selected without being properly integrated in national and
provincial sector strategies; and (b) investments may have been implemented without adequate long-term
maintenance arrangements for their sustainability.

        Perhaps there should have been a stronger effort to limit the number of participating provinces by
including more rigid selection criteria and also by reducing the number of sectors (something that was
done in the follow up operation to PDP-II). Nevertheless, it is important to take into consideration that
this was the only operation available to support governance and fiscal reform at the provincial level and
the national government wanted to have          an instrument for dialogue with the provinces with Bank
assistance. Also, at the time, Argentina was already under consideration for graduation from the Bank. In
retrospect, the project design was perhaps appropriate for the reality of its time. Nobody anticipated that
the economic situation was going to change so markedly.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

Rating: marginally Satisfactory.

        The 22 participating provinces and the city of BA submitted 164 sub-projects. Out of these
sub-projects, 123 were implemented.

        The development objectives as stated were overly ambitious and it was difficult to establish a direct
link between the activities financed under the project and the results the project attempted to achieve.



                                                      - 7 -

Nevertheless, the developmental objectives were not modified during the life of the project. The Bank team
made an effort to identify the impact the project-supported activities had in achieving the development
objectives. The outcome of this exercise as evaluated in this ICR leads to the conclusion that it is, by and
large, not possible to establish direct causal links between the project investments and the public sector
performance of the participating provinces during the life of the project.

          In summary, the project provided provincial governments important tools for public sector
modernization, particularly in the areas of integrated financial management, tax administration
modernization, and up-grading of cadasters. As demonstrated below, there is evidence that the participating
provinces improved opportunities to generate more own revenue, lower their dependences on national
revenue-sharing, and improve their fiscal autonomy.

          Provinces implementing reforms gained greater ability for autonomous fiscal management (which
is still a central goal of Argentina's federalism). The project contributed to promote greater interest at the
provincial level in public sector modernization. The project augmented the government's and the Bank's
earlier advances in creating entry points for public sector reform at the provincial level.

          The project also contributed to the improvement of physical infrastructure in key sectors for
economic and social development. There is some evidence that the improvements in infrastructure
contributed to improved public services in hospitals, and roads.

Analysis:

          The following sections provide evidence for the evaluation of the development objective. Taking
into account the features of the Project's design, this ICR uses the following criteria:

(i)       At the level of the project development objective, the ICR contains a set of indicators for overall
provincial fiscal performance, and then evaluates them separately for the revenue and expenditure sides
with additional indicators.

(ii)      The economic and financial analysis is a cost-effectiveness analysis in areas with quantitative and
monetary indicators.

(iii)     At the level of components, in particular for institutional modernization, four types of indicators
were developed to differentiate the different impacts that were achieved. These indicators are the following:

     ·    Implementation Progress Indicators: these reflect the degree to which modernization efforts have
     been implemented in terms of numbers of provinces, coverage of provincial revenue or expenditures
     operating under new management systems, or regarding the project cycle.

     ·    Reform Process Indicators: these reflect the degree to which the reform process did (or did not)
     advance. This is important since not all reform measures produced an explicit fiscal impact but still
     were pre-requisites to achieving the desired objective.

     ·    Fiscal Impact Indicators: given the focus of the operation, it is particularly pertinent to see
     whether the reforms implemented contributed to improved fiscal conditions.

     ·    Cost-effectiveness: although public administration modernization and infrastructure investment



                                                      - 8 -

    produced favorable social and economic impacts in most cases, the evaluation of this ICR is based only
    on proxies for cost effectiveness, where applicable.

         It is important to keep in mind that there are several methodological constraints that cannot be fully
overcome when evaluating PDP-II's progress and impact of institutional modernization. These include the
following:

·        Provinces implemented projects at different speeds and depths, and not simultaneously. So it is
often impossible to discriminate among provinces that implemented reforms and those that have not. In
addition, reforms in provinces have been on-going and continuous. Hence, it was not always possible to
evaluate the impact with a control group.

·        A few provinces received support from other sources, such as the Inter-American Development
Bank (IADB), and some implemented reforms without any external support. This limits the ability to show
the impact of PDP-II separately.

·        In an inflation prone country like Argentina, some fiscal values distort the analysis. This dilemma
is particularly evident after the economic crisis in 2001-2002.

4.1.1. Overall Fiscal Performance

         A key goal of the operation was to improve the fiscal performance of provincial governments. The
loan used the provincial governments' current accounts as indicators for this purpose, i.e., by measuring
their capacities to finance current expenditures out of current revenues. This was however not under the full
control of provinces, since current revenues included transfers from the national government. Also, current
account balances were affected by national macro-economic conditions. Hence, evaluating the impact of the
project solely on this indicator would not accurately show the contributions of PDP-II. This ICR therefore
includes an additional indicator that assesses the fiscal autonomy of provinces: the proportion of own
revenues to total expenditures (as a proxy for vertical fiscal imbalances).

a. Current Account Balances

         Current account balances of provinces deteriorated during the 2001-2002 crisis. By 2003,
however, current accounts improved. The provinces' aggregate current account surplus that year was 1.4
percent GDP. In 2004, it was 2.1 percent GDP, and for 2005 it was estimated to be 2.0 percent GDP. By
end-2004, some 21 provinces showed current account surpluses (Figure 2). However, the provinces' fiscal
performances measured by current account balances were due to many factors and clearly not solely the
consequence of the implementation of PDP-II.

Note: Estimates for 2005.



         There were substantial differences in performance among provinces. During 1999-2001, some
were able to sustain positive current accounts (Table 2). But this indicator neither clearly reflected the
willingness nor the ability to reform provincial administrations. Some were able to adjust adequately
through inflation and freezes on salaries, practices which are clearly unsustainable over the medium and
long term.

b. Fiscal Autonomy: Proportion of own revenue to total expenditures

         The indicator for fiscal autonomy shows which proportion of a provincial government's
expenditures is financed out of its own revenue. It may therefore be used as a proxy to mirror vertical fiscal
imbalances among levels of government. It can be inferred that a province is fiscally more autonomous if it
finances a higher proportion of expenditures through its own revenue. Including this indicator here is
justified on several grounds. Argentina's provinces have high transfer dependencies although there are
substantial differences across levels of government. But in 2004, most provinces still depended between
80-90 percent on transfers.

         The evaluation carried out for this ICR was based on the progress the provinces achieved in
modernization of their tax administrations. There is some evidence that provinces implementing tax
administration projects financed a higher proportion of their expenditures through own revenue sources.
Reforming provinces achieved most of their gains in fiscal autonomy until 1998. Thereafter, additional
gains by reforming provinces remained limited compared to provinces which did not implement any tax



                                                      - 10 -

administration reforms. The project helped provinces through the implementation of tax administration
projects. Therefore, PDP-II created favorable conditions for more autonomous fiscal management and a
reduction of dependence on federal transfers which has been a central reform goal in Argentina since the
1990's.

                               On the other hand, it bears noting that not all activities supported under PDP-II had a potentially
direct impact on the level of own revenue (which is a function of the tax rates applied), as well as on the
level of expenditures. Also, it is important to recognize that the analysis is not based on weighted indicators
(Figure 3).

Neuquen (integral tax administration projects); Catamarca, Corrientes, Chaco, San Juan, Santa Fe, Tucuman (partial tax

administration).
Provinces with no tax administration modernization projects include: Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Formosa, Jujuy, La Pampa,
Mendoza, Rio Negro, Santa Cruz, Santiago del Estero, Tierra del Fuego.


c. Own-Revenue Enhancement: Own revenue versus total revenue

                               Given the relatively low share of provincial taxes in total revenue, a key reform goal was to assist
provinces to raise more own revenue from taxes. Hence, the provinces' shares of own revenue in total
revenue was a useful yardstick. This indicator can reflect not only the effectiveness of tax administration
measures: it also indicates the degree to which a province was willing to bear the political costs of tax
collection. On the other hand, it is also related to the degree to which citizens exact accountability on
provincial governments with the leverage that taxation provides them.

                               This indicator has, however, a number of limitations. First of all, it is not fully under the control of
the provinces--transfers are managed by the national government and depend on macro-economic
conditions. In addition, provinces have restricted autonomy to set the tax rates which determine levels of



                                                                         - 11 -

tax collection. Also, provinces administer a number of distortionary taxes, like the gross receipt sales tax.
Raising more revenue from these sources may have undesirable economic effects.

                     The ICR evaluation attempted to discriminate between provinces that modernized their tax
administrations and those that did not. There is some evidence indicating that                       provinces with tax
administration modernization projects obtained a higher share of their income from own revenue sources.
They collected more taxes and hence had greater abilities to reverse their high transfer dependence (Figure
4). However it is also important to note that most progress on behalf of reforming provinces with regards to
the collection of additional own revenue was achieved until 1998. Thereafter, both reforming and
non-reforming provinces displayed similar performances.

Note: Provinces with "integral", "partial", or tertiarized tax administration modernization
projects include: Entre Ríos and Neuquén (integral tax administration projects); Catamarca,
Corrientes, Chaco, San Juan, Santa Fe, Tucumán (partial tax administration projects); Chubut,
Buenos Aires Municipality, La Rioja, Misiones, Salta, San Luis (tertiarized tax administration).
Provinces with no tax administration modernization projects include: Buenos Aires, Cordoba,
Formosa, Jujuy, La Pampa, Mendoza, Río Negro, Santa Cruz, Santiago del Estero, Tierra del
Fuego.


                     These results lend support to the view that the project may have contributed to strengthening the
fiscal positions of participating provinces--at least at the margin. There are now, in fact, provinces that
reduced their excessive transfer reliance and who were willing to raise more revenue.

d. Assessment

                     PDP-II may have contributed to improve the fiscal performance of provincial governments
although the specific contribution of the project cannot be isolated from other effects. Tax administration
modernization enabled provincial governments to raise more revenue and lower transfer dependence on
transfers from the federal government. The results showed that there are provinces both willing and able to

address important fiscal issues. However, provinces still need to do much more to improve their
expenditure efficiencies in, for example, human resource management.

e. Capacity to plan, program, finance, execute, and monitor investment programs

         A second key goal was to strengthen the capacity to plan, program, finance, execute, and monitor
investment programs. During the life of the project, participating provincial agencies improved their
capacity to prepare, design and implement investment programs financed by the Loan. Over time, the
quality of proposals improved, and the concept of progress indicators as well as impact indicators were
introduced. Tools such as Gantt chart were used. Contrary to PDP-I, most provinces budgeted adequately
and had the required counterpart funds available to pay contractors. Moreover, during the 2001-2002
crisis, the provinces acted responsibly by suspending ongoing biddings and waited until the situation
changed to initiate new contracts.

4.2 Outputs by components:
I - Public Administration Modernization

Rating: marginally Satisfactory

         Some provincial governments in Argentina have advanced further in the modernization of their
administrations since the efforts initiated under PDP-I. These activities concentrated on tax administration,
cadaster management, and financial management. The results have been uneven across provinces but it has
become apparent that a group of them are able to implement important reforms while others (Buenos Aires,
for instance) did less well. The results are thus encouraging but only marginally satisfactory given the
difficulties in attributing outcomes to the project's interventions.

          The following sections provide detailed analyses for each of the areas of tax administration,
cadaster management, and financial management.

4.2.1. Tax Administration

          The implementation of tax administration modernization contributed to increased taxpayer
compliance; greater accountability by provincial governments towards the citizens and taxpayers; as well
as raising more own revenue. The following sections elaborate on these improvements.

a. Implementation Progress

          Tax administration modernization included process automatization, e-government, integration of
data bases, measures to strengthen taxpayers compliance, and minor infrastructure investments. Fourteen
provinces implemented tax administration projects. Two of these provinces serve as pilot models: Entre
Ríos and Neuquén, representing 11.9 percent of all tax revenue raised by provincial governments. (The
data is from 2003 and excludes Buenos Aires province and municipality; if Buenos Aires province and
municipality are included, the share decreases to 4.6 percent.). Ten provinces did not implement any tax
administration project, and the implementation across provinces was incomplete. Overall tax collection data
can be found in Tables A1-A3 of Annex 1.

                                                        Chaco, San Juan, Santa Fe, Tucumán

                                                        San Luis
 Definitions: "integral reforms": all mentioned areas are implemented; "partial reforms": at least one of the above
 mentioned areas are implemented; "tercerization": administration is performed by a private sector enterprise.



          In order to properly assess implementation progress in the area of tax administration*, it is
important to note that implementation was performed under assistance from IADB until 1998. Not all
provinces were then able to advance steadily and several provinces were lagging behind. Following a
government decision, the responsibility for assistance was transferred to the Bank in 1998. In addition,
during the 1990's there were several discretionary transfers provided by the federal government from the
ATN (Asistencia del Tesoro Nacional) account. These did not provide sufficiently positive incentives for
the provinces to raise more own tax revenue through tax administration projects.

b. Reform Process Indicator

          This indicator measures advances in two critical areas: taxpayer compliance, and the enforcement
of sanctions. Provinces in which tax administration is efficient--by closing loop-holes in collection, by
facilitating services to tax-payers, by increasing controls--would be expected to have a higher amount of
taxes paid by taxpayers compared to the amount of taxes payable on the basis of tax declarations.

          Differentiating between provinces that implemented tax administration projects and those that did
not, it is evident that the reforming provinces increased compliance. Between 1995 and 2003, these
provinces increased the amount of taxes paid, from 68.8 percent to 72.7 percent on average (Table 6). In
provinces without tax administration projects, the same values decreased from 66.1 percent to 65.4 percent
in the same period (Table 7). These indicate the effectiveness of the modernization process.

        There is a similar positive trend with regards to the enforcement of sanctions. In provinces which
underwent tax administration reform, the percentage of registered taxpayers subject to administrative
actions (fiscalización) increased from 26.3 percent to 32.1 percent between 1995 and 2003 (Table 8). In
non-reforming provinces, this ratio fell from 20.3 percent to 15.6 percent in the same period.

c. Fiscal Impact Indicators

                        As noted, the tax administration modernization supported by PDP-II appears to have contributed
positively to improving the finances of provincial governments in terms of fiscal autonomy and
own-revenue enhancement. It is important though to gauge whether the provinces modernizing tax
administration were able to raise more tax revenue than those which did not pursue improvements.

                        There is at least some evidence that provinces with tax administration projects did in fact, raise
more revenue than those provinces that did not have such projects. The former were also able to sustain the
flow of own revenue despite adverse macroeconomic conditions. During 1999 and 2001, these provinces
were able to sustain higher resource flows from their own sources. However, the after effects of the crisis
severely limited their ability to raise tax revenue after 2001. The impact was even more severe in
non-reforming provinces (Figure 5).

d. Estimate of Cost Recovery

         No data is available to measure the cost of tax administration before and after the modernization
process in the provinces.

4.2.2. Cadaster

         Most, though not all, provinces reformed their cadasters. There were significant elements that
showed important progress, for example, in the values of taxed land, and covered surface. This is
contributing to the building of fiscally more autonomous governments.

a. Implementation Progress

         In the course of the implementation of PDP-I and PDP-II from 1990 to 2004, some 19 provinces
up-graded cadaster management, while two others implemented reforms with other support. These reforms
included new forms of land valuation, mapping of taxed land, automatization of property registries, and
integration with tax administration agencies.

b. Reform Process Indicator

         The provinces achieved important progress in cadaster reform. Until 2002 (the last year for which
complete data sets are available), the participating provinces did the following: (ref. Table 10):

   l increased the valuation of land by 40 percent (avalúo) from 1995. Values for the valuation of land
         are stated in nominal terms, although inflation was high, particularly after the crisis year 2000. The
         rationale for this is that provinces are usually not able to increase valuations of land and the taxed
         value. This was particularly true after the economic crisis when, politically, the provincial
         authorities could not change fiscal prices of land properties. It follows that values expressed in
         nominal terms still mirror the reform effort by provinces;

   l increased the taxed value by 33 percent (facturación) from 1995. Values are in nominal terms.
         (See above justification); and

   l increased the covered surface of up-graded property registration by 38 percent. In 2003, provinces
         covered 81 percent of all urban surfaces, and 58 percent in the rural areas. Data covers provinces
         which have placed demands for this operation. In the aggregate, provinces have covered 97 percent
         of the surface of urban cadaster and 91 percent of the rural cadaster.

         These advances reflect the fact that Argentina's provinces only began modernizing their cadasters
in the early 1990s with the support of PDP-I. And the data on the past progress do not reflect the
challenges of fully exploiting their potential benefits.       One of these elements was indicated in the
explanation above that the provinces were unable to increase valuations of land and taxed values after the
economic crisis because of the existing political climate. Furthermore, between 1995 and 2004, the value of
Argentina's land tax was subject to enormous devaluation. In addition, analysis has indicated that weak
communications between the agencies responsible figured significantly in the differences between the
respective increases in the evaluations of land and tax bills.

         Other practical obstacles also stand in the way of the prospects for early and substantial
improvements. With their relatively late starts, all the provinces now face requirements for technology


                                                     - 20 -

investments to protect data bases and to improve information technology. They also need to make better use
of cadaster information to calculate property taxes and assess land values more in line with market values.
And that information needs to be fully integrated with provincial property registries. Equally important,
cadaster systems need to be deployed at the municipal level.

         These are all formidable tasks for the future. However, the provinces can see that cadaster
management can provide more fiscal revenue from the land tax, and can give users better services. The
results indicate that the cadasters are beginning to demonstrate positive impacts, which have reasonable
prospects for continuation.     Further progress should be feasible, particularly in the seven Argentine
provinces that have transferred property taxes to their municipalities.       The follow on Sub-National
Governments Public Sector Modernization Project (Loan 7352-0-AR) includes provisions for further
upgrading of cadaster systems and strengthening of their management.

c.       Fiscal Impact Indicator

         Provinces do not upgrade their cadasters for purely fiscal reasons. They also are useful for land
use service delivery, elaboration of poverty maps, investment planning, etc. It is however still important to
assess whether there was also a fiscal impact implied in the modernization efforts and if this is reflected in
greater tax revenue collections. But assessing this involves dealing with the aforementioned difficulty that,
between 1995 and 2004, the value of Argentina's land tax was subject to enormous devaluation. The
2001-2002 crisis, and later the recovery, implied that most provinces did not adjust the taxed value (
avalúo)to the new price level in the aftermath of the economic downturn. In real terms, therefore, the
revenue from the land tax decreased in all provinces over the same period.




                                                    - 21 -

                  Thus, it is notable that the provinces which implemented cadaster modernization increased their
revenues faster in the post-2003 economic recovery. Provinces without such efforts fared worse and
suffered an even deeper decline. PDP-II therefore appears to have contributed to provinces developing a
stronger revenue base from the land tax, although future analysis is needed to verify this hypothesis (Figure
6).

support. These 18 provinces include seven provinces that also implemented tax reform
administration projects. Therefore, these data do not mirror the effects only of cadastre improvement.



d. Estimate of Cost Recovery

                  For the reasons outlined above, it is difficult to obtain robust measures and estimates of cost
recovery of cadaster reform. A simple calculation adding all annual increases in collection of the land tax
between 1995 and 2003, and adding all investments destined for cadaster up-grading in the same period
gives an estimate for cost recovery of 7.7; i.e., investments provided a return of 770 percent, a very
favorable, if preliminary, rate (Table 11).

4.2.3. Financial Management

        The implementation of financial management systems included the integration of administrative
sub-systems (human resources, tax administration, others) into a single data and management system. Also,
some provinces reformed their legal frameworks to provide more transparent and streamlined regulations
for budget management. These actions provided tools for provinces to improve expenditure control, cash
flow planning and management, debt management and reporting of executed budgets.

a. Implementation Progress

        Seven provinces implemented sub-projects in financial management (San Juan, Misiones,
Tucuman, Salta, Entre Rios, Santa Fe and Formosa). These provinces have gained the potential for more
budgetary oversight and greater control over expenditures. Overall, in 2004, about 71 percent of all
provincial expenditures were covered by integrated financial management systems (value without Buenos
Aires province and municipality; with Buenos Aires province and municipality: 81.9 percent). This
includes efforts made through PDP-II as well as through IADB operations or own efforts. Progress
therefore is promising although more remains to be done to fully achieve the desired impacts, as over 37
percent of 2004 expenditures were not yet covered (Figure 7).

b. Reform Process Indicator

        Before provinces started to implement financial management systems, their information systems
were often rudimentary. Oversight was poor. Information exchange was often non-existent as
administrative sub-systems (human resources, tax administration, investment planning) existed in parallel
with no integration. There was no or little automatization. The regulatory and legal framework was
incomplete, providing few incentives for transparency and accountability in the management of provincial
finances.

        PDP-II assisted the provinces in improving this situation. Provinces that have started to implement
financial management systems have advanced considerably. Some provinces, among others, Corrientes,
Entre Ríos, Formosa, Rio Negro, Salta, San Juan, and Santa Fe achieved the following:

   l Notable advances in integration of data of administrative sub-systems with the National Integrated
        Fiscal Information System.
   l Weekly 12-week projections of cash flow.
   l Executed budgets are usually available in the first five days of the month, demonstrating the
        evolution of revenue and expenditures.
   l Debt payable is projected for 12 weeks, which is significant since the provinces use debt as a
        significant financial resource.

c. Fiscal Impact

        No assessment was performed of the fiscal impact of the implementation of financial management
systems since direct revenue raising or expenditure constraining effects are methodologically difficult to
identify and assess.

d. Financial Rate of Return/Estimate of Cost Recovery




                                                     - 24 -

        Without a fiscal impact indicator, this ICR does not provide a cost recovery estimate.

        The following sections provide analyses of some activities in the areas of judicial modernization
and other institutional modernization in selected provinces.

4.2.4. Judicial Modernization

a. Implementation Progress

        The project also supported judicial modernization efforts in Cordoba, Salta, and Santa Fe.
Provinces were selected through a competitive process which entailed a diagnostic of judicial problems and
a strategic development plan based on the study. Additional requirements were that the plans incorporate
means to resolve some common complaints ­ e.g. increasing the hours in which courts were open to the
public and to address problems of delay, congestion, and access.              This component financed the
implementation of development plans, largely through the provision of additional technical assistance,
purchases of automation equipment for case management and tracking systems, and in the case of Salta,
the construction of a new building to consolidate the judicial offices dispersed throughout the capital city.

        There were delays in this component's contracting. However, these proved fortuitous as they
forced a focus on the preparatory stages and other aspects of their strategic plans. This development was
aided by further technical assistance, and efforts to develop exchanges among the three court systems. As a
consequence, all three judiciaries progressed in upgrading their internal organization, automating basic
administrative processes, improving user service, and expanding access to a wider range of citizens.

        The implementation of these sub-projects was innovative. The Bank agreed with the Judicial
Power and the provinces on progress indicators linked directly to the modernization efforts, so as to avoid
the equipment and (the building in the case of Salta), being completed without accomplishing the reforms
agreed. In this regard, for example, the authorization to initiate the bidding process was only given
when the Bank received evidence demonstrating that and agreed impact indicators had been
accomplished, such as the change of working hours for judges. In the case of Salta, the construction of
the Judicial Building was also linked to the implementation of the cadaster, financial management and tax
administration modernization. Therefore, the Judicial Power and the Executive had to work together to
accomplish the strategy agreed or the building would not have been completed.

b. Reform Process Indicator

        Common achievements in all provinces included the improvement of intake systems, via the
introduction of single reception desks (mesas de partes), a random process for distributing cases (thereby
eliminating judge shopping), and an automated means for recording the initial assignments including the
assignment of a single identification number to new filings. All three also expanded the hours courts are
open (despite initial protests from judges). In addition:
·       Salta and Santa Fe added automated kiosks in the principal courthouses to allow parties to track
the location of their cases and provided Internet links for off site consultations, upgraded their evidence
rooms to reduce chances of tampering with or losing evidence, and introduced new mediation systems to
encourage extrajudicial resolution of simple disputes.
·       Santa Fe conducted a case purging exercise in the most congested trial courts, reducing backlog
(by retiring expired cases) up to 75 percent. Both Cordoba and Salta conducted similar exercises as a
prelude to introducing automation equipment.



                                                      - 25 -

·       Cordoba collected all criminal cases without an identified suspect (a major source of trial court
congestion) into specialized courtrooms. Aside from decongesting other courts, this also enhanced the
chances of finding links among unresolved cases.
·       Santa Fe consolidated its multiple administrative offices, thereby reducing the capacity of office
directors to lobby separately with members of the Superior Court.
·       Cordoba began to take disciplinary measures against judges who did not keep abreast of their
work.
·       Salta successfully campaigned for a change to the civil procedures code allowing for an expedited
process for landlord-tenant disputes and the creation of specialized courts for bankruptcy proceedings. It
also created an electronic link with company registries for expediting commercial cases.
·       All three have upgraded their judicial and staff training programs.

The three provincial judiciaries' experiences also had significant positive spillover effects. The Salta
court's dynamism inspired similar innovations in the local attorney general's office, including basic
automation of case registries and the introduction of a program of weekly visits to poor neighborhoods in
which prosecutors provided assistance with various legal problems. Cordoba adopted a new criminal
procedures code and is strengthening coordination between judges, prosecutors, defenders, and police. Salta
has been instrumental in forming a network of provinces to compare experiences in automation and
combine forces to reduce the often exorbitant amounts and unfavorable conditions imposed by the few
companies providing these services. One consequence has been the successful negotiation of access to
source programs by those buying case management software. All three provinces have also been active in
forming a network to improve the quality and standardize the content of judicial management statistics, and
have undertaken shared training programs with neighboring court systems.

In addition, Salta's new courthouse facilitated the judiciary's installation of its state-of-the-art case
tracking system and electronic links with registries and banks, provided room for new public services
introduced, and facilitated matters for clients who formerly had to trek all over the city in pursuit of
documents and officials essential to pursuing their judicial business. The judiciary in Salta had used 34
different buildings in the city. The new courthouse has also facilitated scheduling of hearings, archive
management, and related judicial functions, and not the least, has had a very positive effect on judicial
morale.

c. Fiscal Impact

        The fiscal impact was assessed only for the Salta province. Under the project, a new building
finished in 2005 is providing the province with savings as well as other monetary benefits. The sale of the
previously used judicial offices and buildings is estimated to provide funds equal to 26 percent of the total
investment.



d. Estimate of Cost Recovery

        Insufficient information is available to present a cost recovery ex-post.

4.2.5. Other areas of institutional modernization

        Besides cadaster, financial management, tax administration, and justice, the project supported
several other areas of institutional modernization. These areas are, among others, the up-grading of



                                                    - 26 -

property registries, e-government, streamlined administrative processes in planning, as well as human
resource modernization.

         This ICR does not present an evaluation of each of these additional reform areas, but notes the
modernization of human resource management as a relatively new area of engagement. Reforms were
implemented in Salta and Misiones. This modernization was aimed at streamlining of administrative
processes; formalization of administrative processes in particular for hiring personnel; and the introduction
of a centralized payroll (legajo único).

         Reform progress was only assessed for Salta province. The data show some positive developments:

     ·   The hiring process time decreased between 15 percent and 20 percent.
     ·   The time to complete teachers' hirings was reduced by 93 percent (from an average of 101 days
     down to 8 days). The average cost for each administrative process was reduced by 86 percent.
     ·   All executing agencies (100 percent coverage) of the provincial administration use the centralized
     and on-time payroll management system (legajo único). This Internet- based system allows employees
     to access and obtain information about the status of administrative processes. More important, it gives
     administrators oversight of payrolls.
     ·   Absenteeism in the health sector was reduced from 20 percent to 3 percent.

         The assessment of fiscal impact was only performed for Salta, regarding the modernization of its
human resource management. In it, there were accumulated savings of US$ 511,840 after efficiency gains
during three years. For a province with a moderate amount of expenditures when compared to the average
province in Argentina, this represents an important level, especially considering the devaluation of the peso
vis-à-vis the US dollar in the same period. If one considers the accumulated fiscal savings of US$ 511,840
in Salta, the cost recovery of the investment reached in 5 years would amount to an internal financial rate
of return of 18.2 percent.

II - Physical Investments

Rating: marginally Satisfactory

         About 55 percent of PDP-II's resources were directed to finance US$114.9 million of physical
investments in 18 sub-projects (ref. Annex 8).

         The project achieved improvements in the quality of infrastructure, and helped provincial
governments in their "capacity to plan, program, finance, execute and monitor investment programs that
are economically efficient, financially sustainable, institutionally manageable, and environmentally sound."
However, service improvements emanating from these investments are difficult to evaluate in a
comprehensive manner, which accounts for the marginally satisfactory rating.

I. Implementation Progress in the Roads, Health, and Education Sectors

         The implementation progress for these activities was satisfactory. The economic crisis did cause
significant delays but progress improved afterwards considerably and all civil works were completed.

Sector Evaluation

Roads

         Type of Investments. The PDP-II financed six road infrastructure works in five provinces. Road
paving was done in the provinces of Misiones, Corrientes, and Formosa. Bridges were built in Santa Fe and
Misiones. The total investment was US$ 38.2 million, which is 20 percent less than was estimated (ref.
Table 12).

TOTAL


         Methodology of evaluation. The net benefits were assessed based on a reduction in operational
costs (measured through reduction in travel time for users); on the revaluation of land in surrounding areas
as well as increase in economic activity (for instance in tourism); social benefits due to better flow of
transit and higher mobility, particularly in adverse climate (raining season); lower rate of accidents.

         The cost-benefit analysis is based on real costs, including: pre-investment, infrastructure works,
inspection, maintenance and administration. The evaluations are based with an annual discount rate of 12
percent and a projection of the following: Misiones pavement (15 years), Corrientes pavement (16 years),
Santa Fe bridge "Ing. Candiotti" (12 years), Formosa pavement (20 years), Misiones bridge "Santa Maria"
(16 years), Misiones bridge "Itacaruare" (16 years).

         The cost-benefit analysis took into account three variables: (i) demand (based on road use), (ii)
operational costs for road use, (iii) travel time.

         Evaluation. The evaluation shows that the Ex-post Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is 28.0 percent,
which is above the 22.9 percent estimated at appraisal. The net present value (NPV) is US$ 45.9 million,
which is 84 percent higher than assessed at appraisal (Table 13).

Note: All values in constant US$, base year 1998.


         Thus, the road investments of PDP-II can be considered satisfactory, subject to available
information and assuming that adequate maintenance arrangements are in place. The evaluation
demonstrates that there are significant socio-economic benefits as a result of the investments. In all
infrastructure works, there are savings in terms of operational costs; a reduction in travel time; an increase
in the value of land in surrounding areas; and higher economic activity, particularly in the tourism sector
(Ref. Annex 10). There were higher economic and social benefits in areas with higher population
concentrations and needs for infrastructure up-grading.


Evaluation in Provinces

         Corrientes: Road pavements were done in the urban center and to facilitate access to urban areas.
This has reduced travel time for road users. There was also revaluation of land values in the amount of 46
percent. Also, there is higher economic activity. Roads up-grading has a high user satisfaction.

         Formosa: The road pavements have facilitated access to several urban areas, particularly
important since the province has an adverse climate due to high levels of precipitation (between 1,000 and
1,300 mm annual rainfall). This has contributed to better circulation of passengers and cars. There has
been a revaluation of land and buildings in surrounding areas.

         Santa Fe: The up-grading of the bridge "Ing. Candiotti" has contributed to better traffic flow over
the Oroño Bridge, which is a gateway for commerce with MERCOSUR countries. Hence this infrastructure
work has additional positive externalities.


         Misiones: Roads upgrading: Works were carried out in the city center of Posadas. These have
contributed to better flow of traffic, with additional socio-economic benefits in local businesses.

         Bridge: The reconstruction of two bridges "Santa María" and "Itacaruaré" have facilitated access
and traffic between the municipalities of San Javier and Concepción. This has improved traffic flow on
route no. 2 providing access to tourism areas and agricultural land.

Health

         Type of investments. The project supported the up-grading, construction, purchase of equipment,
and, in some cases, technical assistance, for five hospitals, located in the provinces of Santa Fe, Río Negro,
Santiago del Estero, Formosa, and Córdoba. Interventions were justified by: (i) the obsolescence of hospital
buildings; (ii) poor medical services and equipment; (iii) insufficient capacity to provide adequate health
care services to the population. Table 14 shows the project's main interventions as well as the total cost
and Bank financing.

         This ICR presents an evaluation of four of the five hospitals that were up-graded in the provinces
of Santa Fe, Rio Negro, Formosa and Cordoba. The Santiago del Estero hospital was not included in the
evaluation, as the province was not able to provide the data required.

         In the case of Santa Fe, it should be noted that investments were executed as part of a larger
package of Bank assistance. The investment intervention of PDP-II was embedded in provincial health
reform strategies, of which children hospital infrastructure was an essential component. Technical
assistance for the health reform strategy was supported by other Bank operations in the country: (i)
Provincial Health Sector Development Project (Loan No. 3931 AR) and Provincial Reform Adjustment
Loan- Santa Fe (Loan No. 4634-AR).

         Evaluation. The infrastructure and the equipment were improved for all the hospitals. This has
contributed to a higher level of resolution for medical problems at the local level, particularly for new
complex medical procedures. Thus, costly and dangerous relocation of patients to others cities has been
avoided. Management capacities regarding administrative and medical care processes were strengthened

adopted important improvements in medical care management. Table 15 below highlights the findings of

         The overall outcome of the project intervention was a substantial improvement in hospital
management in efficiency and better services. The hospitals supported increased their technical capacity to
solve medical complex problems and their productivity and effectiveness. This positive outcome was
achieved despite the fact that not all hospitals received technical assistance. In addition, a limiting factor
that lies outside the scope of the PDP-II was the need of a more consistent health reform strategy of
provinces in coordination with the federal government, under an umbrella of a wider process of health
reform. Also, cost recovery efforts contributed to fiscal savings, but were not pursued by all provinces in a
consistent manner.

Individual Hospital Evaluation

         Santa Fe province. One area of health reform pursued by the province was targeted to the children
hospital "Ricardo Gutiérrez" in the city of Santa Fe. This hospital served not only the citizens of the city
but also a large number of patients from the center and northern parts of the province which has a
population of 1.5 million. The goal was to create a provincial and regional pediatric health network for the
integration of different health services, which included the private sector as well as social security services.
For this purpose a new hospital was key, to be used as head of the network. Previous to investment for a
new hospital and the health reform process, the organizational processes were inefficient and the
infrastructure out-dated and insufficient to serve the population. Its administrative processes were



                                                    - 31 -

streamlined and its infrastructure and the equipment were up-graded.

        A new children hospital was built, which is now the largest children hospital in the province
offering 70 percent of all beds of children hospitals. The total investments for the hospital accrued to USD
21.5 million. Investments were carried out in the period of 1995 to 1999. Technical assistance for this
hospital was supported by other World Bank operations in the country: The management structure was
improved and the new hospital carries out strategic planning in critical areas.

        The performance indicators listed in Table 16 show overall improvement for more efficiency. The
hospital increased the number of patients and percentage of occupation as well as increased the number of
occupied hospital beds. Financial management has improved and overall there are significant service
improvements for patients. Also, the hospital has pursued important cost recovery efforts.

        In 1999, there was a transfer between hospitals, from the Hospital Ricardo Gutiérrez
(January-August) and from the Hospital Alassia (from August). In this case, the available beds have been
averaged for both hospitals (the Gutierrez included 90 beds and the Hospital of Children "Dr. Edging
Alassia" increased this amount to 130).

        Rio Negro province. The Hospital Artemides Zatti in the Río Negro province is the main hospital
and serves as the center of the provincial health network. Previous to the reform, the hospital management
was inefficient: administrative procedures were complex, there was no cost recovery from social security
patients attended, and infrastructure was obsolete and equipment deficient. The up-grading of the hospital

was initiated in 1997 with infrastructure improvements as well as administrative reforms, and finalized in
2001 with up-grading of equipment.

         The baseline mirrors the situation in 1997 and indicators show the improvements until year 2005.
The project intervention has fully reached its objectives. The hospital has been modernized; and it has also
increased its complexity and resolution capacity with the incorporation of neonatal and of adult intensive
therapy services. There has also been a clinical management change, now including progressive care in
benefit of a positive sanitary impact, treatment of more complex care for patients, and the decrease of
derivations of patients to other hospitals. Also, the area of influence of the hospital has been increased and
there was increased efficiency in coverage and number of attended patients. Overall, patients receive
services that have significantly improved, as can be observed in Table 17:

         Formosa province. The "Hospital de Alta Complejidad Teniente General Juan Domingo Peron"
was initially planned as a general hospital, to replace the General Hospital of Formosa. In 1992 it was
re-designed as a high complexity hospital. With the support of PDP-II, its construction began in 1997 and
finished in March 2000. However, it did not start treating patients before April 2005. For this reason, a
future evaluation would be needed to assess the efficiency indicators with the baseline values below (Table
18). Notwithstanding this, new services previously not existent in the province have been offered to
citizens. Medical assistance effectiveness has improved and there is a decrease in the number of derivations
of patients to other cities and hospitals of the country. Also, the hospital has initiated cost recovery efforts.

Education

         PDP-II supported investments in administrative capacity building as well as rehabilitation of
existing education infrastructure in three provinces: Buenos Aires, Misiones y Santiago del Estero.
·        In the Buenos Aires province, an investment of US$18.1 million was executed for 257 schools,
located primarily in the urban and suburban districts of the city of Buenos Aires.
·        In Misiones, an investment of US$3.0 million was executed for 17 schools.
·        In Santiago del Estero, an investment of US$0.1 million was carried out for one school.

         Given that 94.8 percent of the investment was executed in the Buenos Aires province, this ICR
only assesses outcomes in this province.

         Previous to the project intervention, the education system in Buenos Aires was deficient,
particularly with regards to infrastructure. At least 65 percent of all school buildings had poor and
insufficient infrastructure. PDP-II helped address these problems with two components of its sub-project in
this province: (i) strengthening of financing, budgeting and administrative capacity of the Education
Directorate; and (ii) school infrastructure up-grading and maintenance.

         Unlike other investment efforts of PDP-II, however, the education infrastructure works were
directly coordinated by the PRODYMES I, a Bank-financed project aimed at education reform in a number
of provinces. The PRODYMES I project had three components: (a) institutional strengthening; (b) quality
improvement; and (c) infrastructure: construction, expansion and rehabilitation. The latter project was
implemented during 1995 and 2000, both before and after PDP-II support. In September 1998, the
province requested that the PDP-II assistance be amended so that funding for the component on
administrative capacity building be transferred to the component on infrastructure works. This change
occurred with the explicit understanding that assistance for administrative capacity building be continued
under the umbrella of PRODYMES I. Therefore, without a component of quality improvement and with the
administrative component earlier transferred, PDP-II did not aim to implement an integral reform of the
education system in the province of Buenos Aires. What can be evaluated here are the infrastructure works
in the 257 schools assisted under PDP-II.

Evaluation.

        The data shows that the scheduled infrastructure investments were carried out. To that extent, the
project objective was met satisfactorily. Moreover, there are indications that PDP-II may have had an
indirect impact and benefit on school enrollment because of the infrastructure works. A review of several
indicators for service improvement in the schools rehabilitated in the Buenos Aires province, taking as the
baseline 1997/1998 and using indicators from 2002/ 2003, shows that there were modest improvements in
enrollment and drop-out rates in these schools, compared to the levels in the entire province. However,
there were some negative developments as well.

        In this connection, it is pertinent to note that an OED report has indicated that it is not possible to
establish a clear, causal, and direct link between infrastructure works and education improvement in terms
of enrollment rates and drop-out rates, among others. (Ref. OED's recommendations in the Report No.
28779, "Books, Buildings, and Learning Outcomes: An Impact Evaluation of World Bank Support to
Basic Education in Ghana").

Summary:

        PDP-II was not an easy project to implement. It was somewhat complex to administer and its
nearly nation-wide scope and the many areas of intervention, coupled with the design limitations, added to
the challenge. For these and other reasons, the Project was only completed after a longer period than the
expected six years forecast. Much of this can be attributed to the disruptive and extended effects of
Argentina's 2001-2002 economic crisis. Changes in the national government's positions on PDP-II over the
implementation period and the turnover in the CEU management due to elections and the period when the
country had five presidents, were also contributing factors.

        The above analysis shows the difficulty of evaluating the impact of the PDP-II project with respect
to the ambitious development objectives set out. However, it is possible to conclude that: (i) a substantial
number of participating provinces implemented the indicated management changes in tax administration,
cadaster, and financial management, while a few provinces also undertook changes to human resources
management as well; (ii) there is at least some evidence that provinces which implemented the management
changes had a marginally better fiscal performance that the provinces that did not; (iii) participating
provinces adequately planned and carried out the selected infrastructure investments in roads, education
and health; and (iv) the investments in roads and health, at least, led to measurable improvements in public
services for the immediate beneficiaries of these investments. On this basis, it is possible to evaluate the
overall contribution of the project as, at a minimum, marginally satisfactory in terms of providing
incentives for provinces to undertake public sector modernization programs, while leaving largely open the
deeper question of the impact of these programs in improving actual public sector performance at the
subnational level in Argentina.

        PDP-II provided positive incentives for the provinces. Its multi-sectoral coverage and combination
of infrastructure-support-with-institutional modernization met the provinces' desires for more
demand-oriented assistance and for greater flexibility in their relations with the center.

        However, there are questions about the strategy of linking the financing of infrastructure
investments to provinces' institutional development activities. Physical improvements were presented as
incentives for endeavors in the modernization mainly of the provinces' fiscal management functions. As
Annex 9 shows, the strategy succeeded to the extent that the provinces which were most active with


                                                     - 35 -

institutional development initiatives received the bulk of the physical investment assistance, for which about
half of the Loan proceeds were disbursed.

         However, a close evaluation of the results has raised questions about the usefulness of attaching
reform programs, especially for multisector purposes, to multi-sector infrastructure programs.            The
experience indicated that this was complex operationally and that the linkages between investments and
reforms became unclear in several instances. The approach taken is not judged to be appropriate for the
future given in particular the enhanced focus on measurable results. Currently, the new Bank operations in
Argentina generally support sector investments and the public sector institutional strengthening under
distinct projects.

         Perhaps financing investments as an incentive for reform has to be directly linked to the sector
where the investment is taking place. Also, this strategy should only be used for a short period of time, if at
all, with a reduced number of sectors and provinces. In the case of PDP-II, the strategy lost usefulness over
time.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
         Because of limited information, this ICR has only used proxies for the evaluation of the Economic
Rate of Return of physical investments.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
         Given the limited information available, this ICR has used only proxies for the evaluation of the
Financial Rate of Return. In cases where it was possible to estimate the cost recovery of investments this
was indicated in the corresponding sections.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
         The project's institutional development was modest. PDP-II improved the institutional capacity in
provincial governments to undertake public sector modernization but the extent to which this has led to
concrete improvements in public sector performance remains uncertain. A somewhat limiting factor was the
instability in parts of the public administration at the federal and provincial levels. The Project also
enhanced, at the federal and provincial levels, Argentina's capacities to plan, implement and monitor
resource mobilization and allocation, thereby improving the efficiency of the increasingly important
provincial public sector.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
         Several factors outside of the government's control affected project implementation, including
frequent changes in political leadership, and most notably, the impact of the 2001-2002 economic crisis.
The crisis created a watershed in project implementation. Disbursements dropped dramatically as provinces
were not able to invest. With the inflation, contractors would not assume the risk of procuring goods and
services whose prices could rise substantially in the short term. Managing this crisis exceeded some of the
capabilities of the government agencies.

         Another factor that affected implementation was the heterogeneous nature of provincial
governments. The project did not fare well in the larger provinces that had their own resources to
implement modernization, such as Buenos Aires. Other provinces which were more transfer dependent and
had, more basic development needs were somewhat disinterested for these different reasons.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:



                                                     - 36 -

         During the first years, there were considerable delays, such as getting the Loan Agreement signed.
This in turn created delays as the provinces could not get their subsidiary loan agreements approved by
their legislatures. This situation was fortunately overcome within a year, after a remedial action plan was
agreed with the government.

         Before 2002, there was a strong and wide-spread commitment to the values of federalism in the
federal government, but this wavered in the aftermath of the crisis. There then was a tendency to greater
centralization.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
         The project encountered significant obstacles during its implementation. The project got off to a
strong start, with actual cumulative disbursements exceeding expected ones during 1997 and 1998.
However, implementation slowed down significantly during 1999 and 2000 to come to almost a complete
halt in 2001. The project's closing was extended four times beyond its original closing date, leading to an
overall execution time of nine years. Some delays in procurement affected the implementation of the
project in its early stages. However, the governing rules and regulations were later simplified.

         Project implementation was also affected by institutional discontinuity. The management of and
personnel in the Central Executing Unit changed repeatedly, which was disruptive.

         High level of "ownership" of the Project was one of the most positive factors in PDP-II's
successes, both at the federal and provincial levels. Both PDP-I and II were sustained by the continuous
engagement of the implementing agencies.

         Project management improved during the course of implementation. It was helpful that the
provinces were not treated in a uniform way but that, particularly in recent years, technical assistance
became increasingly more "tailor-made" to address their differing individual needs and desires. This
entailed close monitoring and a discrimination through different planning instruments and pilot
administration models (for tax administration or financial management for instance).

5.4 Costs and financing:
         PDP-II involved investments in the amount of US$ 320 million with no deviations from its original
financing plan. In contrast with PDP-I, there was no co-financing with the IADB. Disbursements were
made satisfactorily. Of the Bank loan of US$ 225 million, a total of US$ 223.9 million was disbursed.

         The following chart shows the percentage of investment for each sector (Table 20).

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
         Sustainability rating: Likely

         The project supported provincial governments which displayed ­and have maintained­ an interest
in modernization. It demonstrated that the modernization process could be valuable for increasing revenues
and reducing reliance on the federal government. Most (though not all) provinces appreciate these benefits
and can see that modernization efforts can pay off. The provinces have repeatedly articulated demands for
further technical and financial support for these institutional improvements. In a 2004 survey, the provinces
requested Bank assistance of almost US$ 100 million for a new operation (ref. Table 21).

         These results suggest favorable prospects for sustainability, which is, however, dependent on
several important factors. First, further progress will continue to rely on the provincial implementing units
but these are not fully integrated into the line administrations of all provinces. And they appear to depend
on support from externally funded projects. Another consideration is that reform sustainability has shown
more promise on the revenue sides of provincial administration. In some provinces, on the expenditure side,
political interests have impeded reforms and even fomented reversals, especially regarding human resource
reforms. Sustainability, therefore, is likely to require the rationalization of the interests of disparate
stakeholders. Third, if the Argentine economy slips this could hamper the implementation of provincial
reforms.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
         A follow-up operation to PDP-II was approved by the Board in December 2005. The Sub-national
Government Modernization Project (Loan 7352-0-AR) is directed at deepening and expanding the efforts
that were implemented under the PDP-II. It aims at further improving the capabilities of the provincial
governments, as well as their municipal entities, to more effectively manage their resources and improve the
quality of government administrative services. Its specific objectives are:
                 i) to support the integrated development and adoption of basic management tools that are
conducive to the efficient and transparent management provincial and municipal resources;
              ii) to strengthen provincial governments in such key areas as those related to land tax and tax


                                                     - 38 -

administration, human resource management, judicial services, civil registries, control entities, and public
safety functions; and
              iii) to support the strengthening of municipal governments through pilot activities designed to
demonstrate the benefits of integrated modernization efforts.

         The Subnational Project finances demand-driven technical assistance for these purposes. It does
not include provisions for physical investments except for minor spatial modifications associated with
institutional development activities.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
         Bank performance regarding lending was marginally satisfactory. It deserves commendation for
tackling Argentina's subnational sector under initially adverse conditions. Although PDP-II was a
follow-up operation, the Bank proceeded with its preparation in the face of the considerable risks of a
complex institutional environment and a challenging framework. However, it did this with the full
appreciation that solving Argentina's subnational issues was critical to its future development. PDP-II's
favorable results, demonstrated in this ICR, generally vindicate this decision, although there were mixed
outcomes in several areas and some important difficulties.

         The design of the instrument was problematic. It should have been sharper in several respects,
including the precision of the operation's objectives and of the envisaged results. Its inadequate provisions
for monitoring did not permit ready comparisons of actual results versus planned achievements. In addition,
in concept, the focus of the operation was too broad. Although, that was in general the strategy at the time
in order to take advantage of a pro-reform government, projects tended to be overloaded, making it very
difficult to implement them. Also, lending instruments available at the time perhaps were not the most
adequate to address the reforms that needed to be done. By tackling administrative modernization as well
as infrastructure, the project was geared to two reform processes with different, sometimes unrelated
technical and financial aspects. This also created problems as it challenged relatively weak institutional



                                                     - 39 -

capabilities. To be sure, the Bank was well aware that the inclusion of physical investments was not ideal
and it would have preferred a tighter focus on institutional modernization. However, it considered that the
combined approach was necessary to meet the provinces' requests, and thereby build support and
ownership of administrative and fiscal reforms.

7.2 Supervision:
         Bank supervision was satisfactory. Regular supervision missions were conducted with appropriate
teams (although the wide variety of issues to be dealt with was technically challenging and difficult to deal
under the Bank's supervision budget).Bank missions also included specialists to ensure compliance with
fiduciary aspects of project implementation, procurement financial management and environment. The
Bank also saw that UEC and PEU staff were trained regularly regarding procurements matters. As a
result the project did not suffer from major procurement issues, which was very important considering the
large number of contracts and clients. Documentation of the operation was impeccable. The Project Status
Reports were detailed and reflected the problems that emerged. Task management was also proactive in
addressing problems, and was quite flexible in dealing with the crisis situation after 2000. There was
excellent dialogue with counterparts both at the federal and provincial levels, which helped create an
environment of mutual trust. There was close coordination of supervision of other Bank projects. Another
effective factor was the continuity of task management. This was a significant asset for the Bank in dealing
with the occasional instability of the federal government during project implementation.

         The Loan started disbursing before PDP-I closed. This created two windows which caused
confusion and poor oversight. After 2000, PDP-II disbursements declined due to the crisis, which caused
the Bank to extend the closing date twice. This created some uncertainty on the part of the Bank's
counterparts. Some counterparts believed that the project should have been changed more to address the
new provincial needs after the crisis.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
         Rating: Satisfactory

         The Bank team made a significant effort to overcome design issues, and maintained a strong
dialogue with the national and provincial level authorities in order to keep the project as focused as
possible on public sector reform issues. Bank rating is satisfactory in view of the approach employed for
addressing the perceived risks, the leadership exercised in the implementation of the operation; and the
quality of the continuing support given to the counterparts during changing environments. The project was
kept running well over eight years in spite of several changes of counterparts at the federal and provincial
levels as well as the unfavorable economic environment. These factors more than compensated for the
design problems of the operation.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
         The Borrower's participation in the operation's preparation was satisfactory. At the federal level,
the preparation was led by the Ministry of Interior, and the Unit for Asuntos Provinciales in particular. The
federal officers were quite supportive, which contributed to a favorable institutional environment.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
         Government performance during implementation was generally "satisfactory". Its level of
commitment however, was not consistent throughout, as might be expected perhaps, over the extender
implementation period. There was a high turnover of staff at the CEU which created unnecessary delays.
At the federal level, there was a distinct trend towards greater centralization and control after the crisis.



                                                     - 40 -

        At the provincial level, there was continuing support for the development objectives of the
operation. However, the leadership of ministers of finance that was strong in the early stages of PDP-II
declined over time. But overall, there was widespread ownership of the operation among most provincial
governments. This sentiment was least strong in the most populous provinces, among them Buenos Aires,
which often had their own resources for implementing institutional modernization.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
        The implementation agency at the federal level was the Central Executing Unit, (CEU) in the
Ministry of the Interior. The CEU was during the 1990's the leading agency for investment in the provinces
and managed, in addition to PDP-I and PDP-II, a series of operations supported by other international
finance institutions. During this period, the CEU received very strong political support. This role however
declined in the late 1990's and after 2000. Many projects were discontinued and the CEU's support
declined. Moreover, its institutional memory deteriorated.

        But despite this slippage and its initial difficulties, the CEU's performance was an important factor
in the project's achievement. It maintained close ties and regular communication with the Provincial
Executing Units (UEP) which was important for helping projects to be carried out on time. It generally
assisted provinces in problem solving and reacted flexibly to adapt to new circumstances. But on some
occasions, the CEU reacted too late to lagging provinces. Only in the last two years of the operation did it
design a method to accommodate the different demands and needs of provinces with the introduction of
pilot models that were implemented in a few advanced provinces, which were replicated in other provinces.
This approach was promising and should be maintained. Overall then, the CEU played an important role
even though its performance was cyclical and uneven. And, to its credit, there were not fiduciary problems
despite substantial personnel changes.

        The performances of the Provincial Executing Units depended greatly on the support of the
provinces' leaders. Those UEPs that had close ties to governors generally achieved more success (as in
Salta) than those that did not. This also depended on how well the UEPs were integrated into line
administrations. Some UEPs lived lives of their own, with little oversight from the governors or others top
provincial officials.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
        Rating: Satisfactory

        The performance of the Borrower was satisfactory. This rating is based on its strong commitment
in the early stages to the goals of PDP-II, and its improved, more flexible management practices in the later
stages. The provinces' clear ownership of the modernization efforts was essential to the successes of
PDP-II.

8. Lessons Learned

1.)   Delink multi-sector reform projects from multi-sector infrastructure projects.            The project
structure combining public sector management and infrastructure was too complex. Combining the two in
order to persuade the provinces to engage in public sector modernization had limited benefits. Moreover,
having provincial multi-sector investments financed under a single operation raised significant risks of: (a)
not being properly integrated in national and provincial sectoral strategies; (b) being implemented without
complementary reforms; and (c) not having adequate sectoral supervision from the Bank's side. Therefore,
the approach going forward is to support improvements in subnational public administration and in
provincial investments through separate, coordinated lending instruments. This new approach was reflected


                                                      - 41 -

in the lending programs for the 2004 interim CAS and the 2006-08 CAS endorsed by the Board in June
2006.

2.) Subnational Governments institutional strengthening projects should be focused in terms of the
areas of intervention and number of clients. Otherwise, there is a high risk of not been able to address
issues properly or not having the necessary resources to deal with the reforms needed. Also, dealing with
too many provinces and sectors makes it difficult to implement and supervise.

3.) Projects aimed at provincial changes should offer a flexible but limited menu of assistance to
address the variety of circumstances and reform needs.

4.) The menu, however, needs to reflect national priorities while respecting the autonomy of
provincial governments. Although a flexible approach is important, linking the process of institutional
reform exclusively to demand is not suitable to obtain the desired impacts. So provinces should not be
permitted to "cherry pick" infrastructure investments without necessary complementary reforms.

5.) Supervision of subnational lending programs is complex costly and requires special provisions.
The require diversity of provincial conditions and priorities make for heterogeneous project conditions,
which may tailor-made solutions. This entails more Bank inputs than projects operating solely at the
national level.

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
         The Central Executing Unit (CEU) of the Ministry of Interior submitted a comprehensive report on
the Project for the ICR. It is in the project files. Since the document (written in Spanish) largely discusses
the Project's background and methodology, readers of this ICR might be interested in the following
informal summary of the CEU's comments on the Project's achievements and their implications.

Summary

         The CEU commented that the Project experience had demonstrated the high complexity and need
for coordinated efforts to carry out and subsequently sustain operations of this type. Therefore, they
commended the Project's use of an integrated methodology, which constituted a fundamental instrument for
fulfilling the diverse requirements of such activities. It also had proven valuable together with the work
performed, to minimize the conflicts which arose in trying to rationalize the actions of the CEU, its
provincial counterparts and the executing agencies, and in turn, transforming the original concepts into true
investments. In this connection, it had particularly been valuable to have had the benefits of the idea of
using prototype projects that successfully demonstrated changes which could be replicated in different
governments. Neuquen Province's integrated tax administration modernization (SIAT) represented a useful
example of this type, which has already been replicated in the provinces of Formosa and Rio Negro.

         The CEU also said that the Project had shown that sub-national governments could use the
knowledge gained in the process to obtain and manage credits directly from international banks, especially
for applying the contracting techniques they had observed. This would enable them to perform dynamic
work in the provinces. The experience also had improved their capacities to identify, evaluate, procure and
supervise sub-projects. PDP-II had provided an efficient synergy in this regard, such as:

    l improving provincial governments' planning and implementation capabilities through specific




                                                      - 42 -

        training programs;
    l the uses of project executing units for administering subprojects;
    l strengthening provincial executing units through sector-related planning and training; and
    l the use of financial aid for preparing other Bank operations, e.g., evaluating pilot subprojects.


        The Project was considered to have been successful as seen in the provinces' current accounts
(except for 1999-2001), which showed the increasing trend of income increases exceeding current
expenses. It was notable that, even during the recession period, provinces which had implemented the
Project's measures were able to attenuate the negative developments at that time. The others tended to
suffer more severe effects from the general economic crisis. The tax and cadastral administration
components were especially important in this context. Overall, the Project's contributions to reforms had
been positive from financial standpoints, particularly in terms of greater revenues, increased financial
autonomies, and better capacities to recover from adverse macroeconomic events.

        The Project's results suggested several recommendations:

    l Strengthen the integration of tax and cadastral administration, especially in the provinces where
        work had proceeded in these spheres;
    l Deepen tax system reforms;
    l Improve tax controls and inspection, including upgrading their staffs and their equipment;
    l In the future, integrate municipal administrative systems for better ensuring the maintenance of
        needed data;
    l For future investment projects, it would be useful to significantly improve the provision of services
        (in coverage, quality and efficiency); and
    l Improve the quality of life of the benefiting population.


        New challenges, said the CEU, are arising because of the fight against poverty, unemployment, and
social demands (housing, education, for example). New programs should not ignore these. It is necessary to
continue with the efforts undertaken, capitalizing on the lessons learned, and getting progressively closer to
meeting civic demands for more efficient public administration.

Notes:
(1) The tax administration management process was separated in eight basic modules: emission; data updating; control of
billing and tax collection; verification of payments; debits and statement of current account; debt reports; intimations and
requests of payment; selection of taxpayers subject to administrative actions; management statistics.
(2) Today data are emitted monthly and in automatic fashion.
(3) The system transfers to Municipalities both the revenue-sharing and the fee that they receive in compensation for tax
collection.

 The table below summarizes the amount allocated to institutional development sub-projects by province
 and which them received physical investments sub-projects.

As shown, provinces that executed larger amounts in institutional strengthening subprojects received
physical investments. Beyond the amount executed in institutional strengthening subprojects, it is pertinent to
observe their features in the provinces that carried out infrastructure subprojects.

The table below summarizes the institutional subprojects carried out in the provinces that received physical
investments. However, many sector reforms such as tax administration were carried out with aid from other
sources, such as the IDB. For reason of availability in the information, the table only includes what was
done under PDP-II.
