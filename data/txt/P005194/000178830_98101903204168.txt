SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises an Agricultural Credit Project for which a
Bank loan of US$14.0 million equivalent is proposed. The loan would support
a two-year lending program for investments in commercial agriculture and
processing industry. The Agricultural Development Fund of Iran (ADFI) would
be the borrower and this would be the second agricultural credit project
the Bank has helped finance in Iran.
ii.       The Bank's lending for agriculture in the past has been for three
irrigation projects, Ghazvin (517-IRN US$22 million), Dez Pilot Irrigation
Project (US$4.0 million under 247-IRN) and Dez Stage I (594-IRN US$30 million),
and for the First Agricultural Credit Project (662-IRN US$6.5 million).
iii.      Growth of Iran's agricultural sector has lagged behind overall
economic growth, and the effective demand for agricultural products; the
country is faced with a rising import bill for agricultural products. The
government is trying to reduce this trend by encouraging investments in
agriculture and this Project would assist this policy. The government is
also stepping up its supporting services for the traditional village sector,
but because of the nature of the problems involved this can at best produce
results in the medium and long term.
iv.       This Project would be essentially a continuation and expansion of
the first loan (662-IRN) made in March 1970 to ADFI. It finances land,
crop and livestock development, orchard establishment and processing
facilities construction. This loan was fully committed by October 1971 and
is expected to be fully disbursed by its original closing date (December 31,
1972). Terms and conditions of the second loan would be similar to the
first, subject to certain modifications introduced in the light of experience
with the First Project.
v.        ADFI, which is an autonomous statutory corporation with its share
capital wholly subscribed by the government, was established in 1968 to
provide medium and long-term credit for Iran's commercial agricultural
sector; it has competent management and qualified technicians.
vi.       Initially, ADFI had a minimum loan limit of US$66,000 equivalent.
This was the upper limit of the Agricultural Cooperative Bank (ACB), which
lends to smaller farmers under concessionary terms. Both limits, however,
have since been lowered to US$13,000 and ADFI therefore can now cover a
wider range of farmers than formerly.
vii.      About 120 to 180 farmers and enterprises would participate in the
Project, which in total would cost US$35.1 million equivalent. Sub-borrowers
and ADFI would each contribute 30% of investment cost and the Bank loan would
finance 40%. This is slightly less than the estimated foreign exchange
component (44%). Sub-borrowers would be charged 8% interest per annum and



- i:L -
would bear the foreign exchange riskc. This is ADFI's present rate. Net
annual foreign exchange earnings and/or savings attributable to the Project
at full development are estimated at; US$10 million equivalent.
viii.     The range of items to be financed under the Project is varied
(irrigation wells, farm buildings arid equipment, for example) and not
suitable for bulk procurement. A ntmber of foreign firms are represented
in Iran, assuring keen competition. Supplies are adequate on the local
market and prices competitive. Therefore, procurement would be through
normal commercial channels.
ix.       Estimated financial rates of return range from 15 to 32% for the
various types of sub-projects. The estimated overall economic rate of return
is about 19%.  The proposed Project would be suitable for a Bank loan of
US$14.0 million for a term of 12 years including a four-year grace period.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In March 1970 the Bank approved a loan of US$6.5 million equivalent
investments in medium- and large-scale commercial farming and processing
of agricultural products. This loan was fully committed by October 1971.
ADFI was established in 1968 to provide medium and long-term finance for
Iran's commercial agricultural sector; the Bank assisted in drafting its
charter and regulations. The Project request for the second loan was pre-
pared by ADFI and received in January 1971; ADFI would again be the borrower.
The proposed Second Project would essentially be a continuation of the First
Project to increase financial assistance for similar investments. It would
finance land, crop and livestock development, orchard establishment and
processing facilities construction. The Bank group has made three other
loans for agricultural development in Iran, all in irrigation: US$22 million
for Ghazvin (517-IRN FY 1968), Dez Pilot Irrigation Project (US$4 million
under 247-IRN FY 1960) and US$30 million for Dez I (594-IRN FY 1969). While
the Dez project is progressing satisfactorily, there have been difficulties
encountered at Ghazvin requiring a revision of the development program.
1.02      Despite recent slow development of the sector, growth prospects
for agriculture are very good. Iran is encouraging investments in agriculture
by providing institutional medium and long-term credit for agricultural pro-
duction and processing. Financial and technical assistance is mainly provided
to the traditional village sector through the Agricultural Cooperative Bank
(ACB) and government agencies, while more commercially oriented farmers receive
financial assistance from ADFI.
1.03      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to
Iran in February/March 1971 consisting of Messrs. M. J. Walden, K. W. Berg
and C. G. Ramasubbu (Bank) and R. A. Crofts (Consultant).
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Iran has an area of some 1.6 million km2 and a population of about
30 million (map). Half the country is covered by mountains and deserts and in
three-fourths of it less than 250 mm of rainfall precludes any form of crop
production without irrigation. Population and intensive agriculture are
concentrated in the north. The climate is mostly continental, extremely hot
in summer and cold in winter, but there are major climatic differences which
give relative advantages and disadvantages to different regions for
producing specific crops and livestock. Except for the narrow coastal and
frontier strip, the country consists of a high plateau bounded by the



Elburz mountain ranges in the north and the Zagros in the west. The plateau
in the interior (1,300-1,700 m above sea level) is semi-arid but interspersed
with green valleys where water is available. The narrow strip north of the
Elburz mountains (Caspian area) enjoys substantially greater rainfall than
the interior. A more detailed description of the agricultural background is
given in Annex 1.
Agricultural Structure and Production
2.02      Currently 19 million ha are under cultivation of which about 8
million ha are cropped in any one year although 40 million ha have soils suit-
able for agriculture; three-fourths of this area, however, receives a rainfall
of less than 250 mm per year and needs to be irrigated for crop production.
The total area irrigated is estimated at 3.2 million ha, but only 1 million
ha is irrigated effectively.  Modern storage dams have added very little to
date (100,000 ha) due to the lack of conveyance systems, while the area
irrigated from wells is increasing by 30,000 ha per year.
2.03      Agriculture accounts for about one-fourth of GNP and provides
employment for over 3 million people or 40% of the labor force. There are
about 2 million farms; the commercial farm sector, however, is estimated to
be only some 100,000 farms. About 44% of Iran's merchandise exports (excluding
oil) are of agricultural origin (US$110 million in 1967-68 average) showing
the sector's importance to the economy, but agricultural imports (US$150 mil-
lion in 1967-68 average) are increasing rapidly and are higher in value than
exports. Main agricultural exports are cotton, hides and leather products,
fresh and dried fruit; imports are vegetable oils, wool and animal hair,
wheat and tea. While total non-oil exports between 1957/59 and 1967/69 grew
by 94%, those of Iran's main agricultural exports grew only by 19%; on the
other hand main agricultural imports grew by 85% during the same period.
2.04      Total annual value of agricultural production is about US$1.8
billion equivalent of which 40% is in the form of livestock products; the
remainder is crops.  Dairy and wheat are the principal products and account,
in roughly equal amounts, for over one-third of total agricultural output.
Mutton, barley, rice, fruits and vegeltables, and cotton are other major
products. The crop, dairy, poultry, :Livestock and fruit sectors are more
fully discussed in Annexes 2 through 6.
2.05      Wheat is by far the most important crop in respect of land use
(4.3 million ha), followed by barley (1.2 million ha), cotton (370,000 ha),
rice (350,000 ha) and sugarbeet (150,000 ha), while fruits and vegetables
together occupy 1.3 million ha.  Iran's livestock grazes largely under
transhumant systems on a large area of range land and hill pastures and is
composed of about 32 million sheep, 13 million goats, 5 million cattle and
15 million head of poultry. This sector produces annually about 2 million
ton of whole milk equivalent and 350,000 ton of meat.
2.06      The growth of the agricultural sector lagged behind the overall
rate of growth of the economy. Between 1963/64 and 1969/70, agricultural
output grew at about 5.8% compared to the overall growth of GNP of 10%, and
it is estimated that over a ten-year period, taking into account weather



-3-
variations, the growth of agricultural output averaged 3% per annum.
Growth has been slowest in livestock (1.5%) and somewhat better in crop
production (3%). Largest output increases have occurred in sugarbeet
and tea, where special programs to increase production have been put into
effect by the government; mutton production has shown the most disappointing
performance with probably no growth at all. There is, however, a consider-
able growth potential for Iran's agricultural sector, although its natural
potential is not as favorable as in some other countries. Recognizing this,
the government is providing funds for various development programs to support
rapid and sustained output growth. Extending long-term credit facilities
through this Project would be a step in this direction and in line with
government policy to encourage investments in the agricultural sector after
completion of the third stage of land reform.
2.07      The structure of farming, particularly the land tenure system,
has undergone a profound change during the past decade. A far-reaching
program of land reform was initiated in 1962 giving land ownership to the
overwhelming majority of peasant share croppers who until then farmed the
land in villages owned by a small number of landlords. The program was
carried out in three stages and opened the way toward a modern, commercially-
oriented agricultural sector, but at the same time has created a host of new
problems as to how to provide farm supplies, marketing, extension services
and credit facilities to the beneficiaries of the land reform. Government is
trying to cope with these problems by exploring different ways and means
to improve Iran's agricultural structure (para 2.10 and 2.11).
Agricultural Inputs and Services
2.08      Supply of fertilizer has increased considerably in recent years
and its use has increased from 500 ton in 1955/56 to 40,000 ton in 1960/61
and 200,000 ton in 1969. Until 1962 all fertilizer was imported; since then
a growing portion is produced in Iran. The Fourth Development Plan (1968-72)
contemplates an additional annual production of 600,000 ton of urea alone.
The use of improved seed varieties, with the exception of improved sugarbeet
seed, is not yet widespread. Improved wheat seed has had to be imported in
large quantity since local supplies were inadequate. Producers have now
founded a seed association and the government is setting up a corporation
to organize seed multiplication through large production units. The FAO/CP
has been asked to help prepare a seeds project. The Plant Conservation
Organization (Ministry of Agriculture) is responsible for pest and disease
control, concentrating on anti-locust operations and measures against the
cotton bollworm. Government encourages the establishment of private pest
control units and gives some financial assistance for this purpose.
2.09      Government services to agriculture are provided by several
Ministries: the Ministry of Agriculture has the primary responsibility for
research and extension; the Ministry of Cooperation and Rural Affairs
(previously designated the Ministry of Land Reform and Rural Cooperatives)
has handled land distribution under the land reform now nearing completion;
it assists rural cooperatives and farm corporations. Soil conservation and
pasture development is handled by the Ministry of Natural Resources, while
the Ministry of Water and Power is responsible for irrigation development
up to farm-gate, and the Ministry of Agricultural Products and Consumer Goods



is concerned with marketing and price stabilization. There has been some
overlap of functions and policy execution, and the government is seeking
means to achieve better coordination. It has already taken a number of steps
aimed at consolidating the ministries and agencies serving the sector.
Agricultural Development Priorities
2.10      Concurrent with the program of land reform which has been implemented
over the last decade, efforts towards modernization of agriculture have
resulted in the creation of new forms of farm organization. These developments
have given rise to three main types of farming units in Iran: agri-businesses
and farm corporations which are predominantly large-scale in nature and
relatively large holdings which are commercially oriented. These groups com-
prise the commercial sector. The third group, the traditional sector, consists
of small farms characterized by fragmented holdings, together with the trans-
humant pastoralists.  This last group is still largely engaged in subsistence
agriculture although some of the farmers have the potential to move into the
commercial sector. Government policy favors a two-pronged approach to the
problem of increasing agricultural production. The need to strengthen the
infra-structure and supporting services for the traditional sector is recog-
nized and positive steps are being taken through the provision of technical
and financial assistance using the Rural Cooperatives, the Agricultural
Credit Bank, special agencies and research and extension services as the
vehicles for such assistance. The development of the production potential
of large enterprises and the commercial sector operating along modern lines
of agricultural management is the other aspect of government policy. (Annex 1)
2.11      Several areas have been identified toward which Iranian agricul-
tural development should be directed in the near future, such as: (i) ex-
tending the area of land being served with a perennial and controlled water
supply where it is economic to do so; (ii) devising means to accelerate the
rate of growth in efficient livestock production and marketing; (iii) lower-
ing unit costs of production by exploiting the regional differences within
Iran; and (iv) formulating an integrated framework of policies to encourage
commercial agriculture.
B. Agricultural Credit
2.12      Banking business in Iran is regulated by the Currency and Credit
Council set up under the Banking and Monetary Law of Iran, with the Governor
of Bank Markazi Iran (the central bank) as chairman. Iran has 27 banks, of
which seven are State-owned, ten private Iranian and ten partly foreign-owned.
Six are specialized, including the Agricultural Development Fund of Iran
(ADFI) (Chapter IV and Annex 7); of these the Industrial Mining and Development
Bank of Iran (IMDBI) lends to some agriculturally-oriented industries. Insti-
tutional credit for agriculture represents only between a quarter and a
third of all loans obtained by farmers, the bulk still coming from private
sources (traders, moneylenders, relatives). While institutional credit for
agriculture has made progress in recent years -- reaching about US$225 million
equivalent in 1969/70 -- there is still a considerable shortage of credit
funds.



- 5 -
2.13      The major institutional sources of agricultural credit are the Agri-
cultural Cooperative Bank (ACB) and the Rural Cooperatives, roughly accounting
for about one-third each of total agricultural credit. The balance is
provided by Commercial Banks, government and ADFI. Both ACB and the Rural
Cooperatives receive their funds mainly from government and lend mostly to
small and medium-sized farmers for short term, having respectively loan
ceilings of US$13,000 and US$260 equivalent on loans to individual borrowers.
There was, however, a gap in the financing for those farmers too large to
borrow from ACB (upper loan limit US$13,000) or ADFI whose lower loan limit
until recently had been considerably higher. The Bank is having a dialogue
with Iran to develop ways and means for better assistance for this group of
farmers and ADFI has now lowered its limit to US$13,000. Further measures
will probably involve the commercial bank system. ACB has 200 branches and
refinances Rural Cooperatives to some extent; this is increasing. ACB has
in recent years maintained its annual lending to individual borrowers of
about US$53 million equivalent. There are 8,400 Rural Cooperatives and their
advances increased from US$42 million in FY 1966/67 to US$71 million in
1969/70 (one fifth was refinanced by ACB). Medium and long-term credit for
the commercial sector is available from ADFI.
2.14      Within the commercial bank sector, Bank Melli Iran and Bank Sadarat
advanced about two-thirds of all loans, mainly short-term, made to agricul-
ture. The former, owned wholly by government, has about 820 branches spread
all over the country and accounts for more than one-fifth of total commercial
bank credit for all purposes. Bank Sadarat, a private bank, has helped
significantly to extend banking to small towns and rural areas, accounting
for 1,700 out of the total of 3,300 commercial bank branches outside Tehran;
its outstanding loans to farmers are about US$30 million equivalent.
2.15      The government also extends a sizable volume of credit to farmers
through special agencies. Irrigation authorities provide fertilizer and
other inputs and services, such as tractor ploughing, to farmers on credit;
other special programs are executed for some selected crops such as wheat
and paddy. The Machinery Bonga, a government company, sells tractors and
other machinery on credit. Companies engaged in marketing and processing
agricultural products (cotton, oilseeds, sugarbeets) often provide credit
for short-term purposes.
2.16      Rates of interest on non-institutional credit to farmers are high,
varying from 15 to 40% per annum, as compared with those charged by institu-
tions: Rural Cooperatives (6%), ACB (7%), ADFI (8%), IMDBI (9%), Bank Sadarat
(10%).  The central bank's discount rate is 7% while interest rate ceiling
paid by commercial banks on fixed deposits is 7-1/2% per annum.
III. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE FIRST PROJECT
Purpose of Loan and Financing
3.01      In March 1970, the Bank agreed to lend to ADFI the equivalent of
US$6.5 million to help finance investments for the development of commercial
agricultural and livestock production and for processing, packaging and



-6-
storage. Under the project, medium- and long-term loans are made to sub-
borrowers for land development, on-farm irrigation, agricultural machinery
and equipment, buildings, constructicin and installation, planting materials
and livestock and for processing, packaging and storage facilities. The
project includes also finance for an agricultural economist as an advisor to
ADFI. Total project cost was estimated at US$16.0 million of which the Bank
finances 40%, ADFI 30% and sub-borrowers the remaining 30%.
3.02      Under the project loan applications are satisfactorily appraised by
competent technical staff on an incremental return basis and taking fully in-
to account market prospects for the products for which ADFI is lending.
ADFI's staff has benefitted from IBRD's training activity; two trainees spent
six months each working with the Bank and a number of ADFI staff participated
in EDI courses.
3.03      Sub-borrowers obtain loans of up to 70% of investment costs for a
period of up to 12 years including a grace period not exceeding five years,
depending on the kind of investment, cash flow projection and life of assets
to be financed. Sub-borrowers pay 8% interest per annum, including one-half
of one per cent as service charge, and one per cent commitment fee per annum
on undrawn loan balance; they also bear the foreign exchange risk.
Lending Operations
3.04      The project is proceeding satisfactorily and investments financed
are sound. As of October, 1971, ADFI had 84 loans approved amounting to
a total commitment of US$22 million equivalent, with 60 partially disbursed
amounting by January 1, 1972 to US$8 million equivalent, but Bank reimburse-
ments (which stood at US$4.5 million as of January 1, 1972) will not be sought
for all of them. The Bank loan was fully committed by October 1971 and is
expected to be fully disbursed by the original closing date of December 31,
1972. ADFI loans have often been given for combined purposes, particularly
annual crops in conjunction with livestock enterprises, but making an
arbitrary separation of the 84 loans, 39 loans were for annual crops and
orchards, 25 for livestock (dairy and sheep), 14 for poultry, three for
agro-industry (processing facilities) and three for agribusiness (see para
2.10); about one-third were on terms of three to five years, one-half of six
to nine years and the balance for 10 to 15 years. In January 1971, ADFI
reduced its minimum size of loans from US$66,000 equivalent to US$33,000 to
cover a wider range of medium-size farmers and this has now been further
lowered to US$13,000.
3.05      ADFI started its operations at the time of the Bank's loan.  Out
of its US$8 million disbursed loans, few repayments have become due and it
is too early to judge ADFI's performance in this respect. Its total long
term borrowings amounted to only the US$4.5 million equivalent of IBRD
disbursements, while the paid-up share capital stood at US$13.2 million,
giving a debt-equity ratio of 0.3:1, which is well below the limit of 3:1
set by the Loan Agreement with the Bank.



-7-
Impact
3.06      It is too soon to form a judgement as to the project's impact.
Indications are, however, that investments in early maturing sub-projects
such as poultry and dairy enterprises, are beginning to show very satisfactory
results. Bank staff visited a total of 20 sub-projects (one quarter of all
loans made); all were found sound, economically justified and well supervised.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Definition
4.01      The Project, which would be part of ADFI's lending program, would
help finance, over a period of two years, long-term investments for medium
and large farmers and agro-industrial operations such as processing, prep-
aration, storage and marketing of agricultural products. In particular,
it would bring about 14,000 ha of land under cultivation and assist
ADFI in making loans to a wider range of farmers because of the recent
reduction of its lower loan limit. The Project would consist of: mixed
farming development (23% of total investment); orchard establishment (12%);
dairy operations (8%), sheep farming (6%), poultry (26%) which would include
the purchase of a total of 2,000 dairy cattle, 40,000 breeding ewes and 4
million head of poultry; and agro-industry (25%). ADFI would be the borrower
and would administer the Project. The total Project cost is estimated at
Rls 2,660 million (US$35.1 million) and the Bank's contribution would be
US$14.0 million or 40% covering slightly less than the estimated foreign
exchange cost (44%).

cultivating about 50 to 150 ha; but also possessing considerable additional
land which would be developed under the Project, mostly by way of minor
irrigation. The estimated number of loans is based on the separate consider-
ation of each investment category, but in practice investments are mostly for
a combination of crop production and livestock, particularly sheep. The
separation into five illustrative types (Appendix 8-2) has been made to test
the financial return of each major production activity on its own merits.
4.04      The composition and size of the proposed Project are based on:
(i) kind and size of loans ADFI has financed so far; (ii) ADFI's expected
staff capacity to process and supervise loans; (iii) ADFI's plans to have
other financial activities outside thie Project, including equity participation,
refinancing and providing short-term loans in conjunction with commercial
banks for special crops (oilseeds for example); and (iv) the increase in the
number of individual loans expected to follow the reduction in ADFI's
minimum individual loan limit from US$66,000 to US$13,000 equivalent (para
2.12).
B. Detailed Features
Mixed Farming
4.05      Subloans would be made for developing about 12,000 ha mostly by
way of minor irrigation, to about 40 farmers depending on the size of each
investment, for annual crop production. This would represent about 23% of
total Project cost. These investments would be mostly made in the cooler
northern part of the country and in the east. Part of these loans would be
made to large agribusiness enterprises (para 4.11).  Crops grown by sub-
borrowers would be:
(i) cereals (wheat, barley, rice, milo)
(ii)  alfalfa (for hay making and for dairy)                                         9
(iii) cotton (medium-staple length ) )
) in rotation
(iv)  sugarbeet                       )
(v)  other crops (sunflower, castor beans, sesame, soybeans,
pulses, tobacco, tomatoes, beans, peas, onions, potatoes,
asparagus).
4.06      Cotton of medium-staple length for export would be cultivated
under improved techniques (row planting, proper irrigation) to substitute
for low quality short-staple varieties of uneven length, since the latter
faces increasing difficulties on the export market. Farmers would produce
the former at high yields--3 ton seed-cotton per ha, which good farmers are
already producing. This would improv,e Iran's competitiveness for its major
agricultural export product (50% of total agricultural exports (1967/68)
and 20% of non-oil exports) under exp,ected price declines (10-15% by 1975)
(para 7.03). Sugarbeet as a rotational annual crop would be grown under



- 9 -
proper cultivation practices. Investments in irrigation facilities would
result in farmers obtaining yields of 40 ton per ha (presently achieved
under proper farm practices) under satisfactory marketing conditions (para
6.02). Farmers would develop land and bring it into cultivation by providing
sufficient water for agricultural production. Investments would be in irri-
gation facilities (32% of investment), machinery and equipment (32%), land
levelling for irrigation (25%) and farm buildings and roads (11%) (Appendix
8-2).
Orchards
4.07      Investments would be mainly in citrus (oranges, grapefruit,
tangerines), apples and pistachios, but also to a lesser extent in pears,
apricots, dates, bananas, grapes, almonds and walnuts. The Project would
help finance part of the development period (two years) of orchard estab-
lishment, while ADFI may provide further financial assistance if needed
until the trees reach the bearing stage. It is expected that under the
Project about 1,600 ha would be planted with trees by about 32 sub-borrowers,
accounting for about 12% of total Project cost. Individual orchard invest-
ments would cover: land preparation and irrigation facilities (29%),
machinery and equipment (9%), on-farm roads and farm buildings (21%),
planting material and maintenance of the young trees (41%) (Appendix 8-2).
Dairy
4.08      Twenty loans for sub-projects including 2,000 cows are expected to
be made under the proposed Project (8% of total Project cost); these sub-
nrojects will be near densely populated areas within Iran. It is expected
that imported heifers will improve Iran's dairy herd genetically and provide
breeding cattle for the traditional sector at a subsequent stage. Investments
would involve stall-fed dairy herds based on high quality in-calf heifers
yielding 5,000 kg of milk per cow per year in average after five years of
establishment (Appendix 8-1) and would often be combined with land development
for fodder production (para 4.05). They would include, for milk production
only, buildings and roads (27% of individual investments), machinery and
equipment (18%) and livestock (55%). ADFI expects some loans to be made for
beef production which would also be financed under this category.
Sheep
4.09      Loans for sheep are mostly combined with loans for annual crops
and orchards. Sheep find excellent food in sugarbeet tops and beet pulp
silage and improve soil fertility by producing manure. It is estimated that
under the Second Project 40 loans for a total of 40,000 ewes would be made,
representing about 6% of total Project cost. Individual investments include
buildings (40%) and livestock (60%) (Annex 5).
Poultry
4.10      This lending would be for three types of production:  (i) broiler,
(ii) parent stock enterprises (hatcheries producing day-old chicks for layer
and broiler units) and (iii) layer units themselves. Sixteen loans are



- 10 -
expected to be made over two years representing about 26% of total Project
cost. Demand for poultry meat and eggs is expected to rise at a high rate
(para 6.02, Appendix 8-2). The number of loans under the proposed Project
could vary considerably due to differences in size and specialization of
each production unit. Investments would be mainly in buildings and roads
(71% of individual investments) and machinery and installations (29%). While
ADFI has lent so far mostly for poultry enterprises near Tehran, more invest-
ments are expected near other cities.
Agro-Industry
4.11      Arising out of increasing production from commercial farming there
is a need for investments in processing agricultural products. These include
milk plants, cold storage and processing facilities for fruit and meat,
vegetable oil extraction, slaughterhouses for chicken and other animals,
packing plants and feed mills. There has been in the past a lack of clarity
in government's marketing policy which did not encourage private investment
in this field, but, as the government now intends to transfer some marketing
facilities to the private sector, anid as the need for facilities to process
agricultural products becomes more apparent, ADFI expects to have substantial
lending operations for agro-industrial investments, which would mainly include
machinery, equipment, buildings and installations. No models have been
developed for agro-industrial investments, because the variations in types
make meaningful presentation difficu:Lt, but since these investments are
usually quite large, prior Bank approval for each would be required (para
5.09). Other projects not mentioned specifically under categories 1-5
(para 4.13) would be financed out of this category after submitting them
to the Bank for prior approval.
Agribusiness
4.12      ADFI expects to receive for this Project about four applications
for financing agribusiness operationEs, large scale vertically integrated
operations in which production (mostly annual crops) would be closely linked           *
to processing and marketing (agro-industrial investments). Investments are
expected to be mainly for land levelling, irrigation facilities, machinery
and equipment for agricultural production and processing. No special amount
has been earmarked for this type of investment, which is expected to be
mainly for annual crop production and. agro-industrial activities. Allowance
for this has been made in calculating the overall financial provision for
these categories.
C. Cost Estimates and Financing
Project Cost
4.13      Total Project cost is estimated at Rls 2,660 million (US$35.1
million) of which 44%, Rls 1,178 million (US$15.6 million), would be foreign
exchange. Cost estimates and foreign exchange requirements, based on the
composition of ADFI's lending activities experienced so far, are:

Financing
4.15      Of the total Project cost (Rls 2,660 million or US$35.1 million)
30% would be financed by sub-borrowers (US$10.55 million); ADFI would con-
tribute 30% from its own resources (US$10.55 million) and the Bank would
finance the rest, 40% (US$14 million), which would be slightly less than the
estimated foreign exchange component (44%). The financing plans for
individual components of the Project are summarized in the following table:

4.16      ADFI would be the borrower; sub-borrowers would bear the foreign
exchange risk. 57% of the sub-loans, representing the part financed out of
the Bank loan, would have to be repaid in the same amount of US$ equivalent
as at the time the loan was made. The Bank loan would be repayable over a
period of 12 years including a period of grace of four years.
4.17      With sub-loans being made over a two-year period, the last repay-
ment to ADFI would be made 13 years after the start of the Project. The
cash flow projection (Appendix 7-1) indicates that repayment of the Bank
loan over 12 years, including a grace period of four years, would be
appropriate.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
4.18      The items to be financed are varied and would not be suitable for
bulk procurement through international competitive bidding. In most cases,
land development and well drilling would be undertaken by small local con-
tractors, while goods required for other on-farm investments, including
planting material, agricultural machinery and equipment, and livestock would
be obtained through existing commercial channels. With the exception of
tractors in a certain horsepower range (45-65) (para 4.19), farm machinery
and equipment, pumps, motors and piping, can be imported without restriction,
subject to a tariff of 5% (pumps and motors 20%). They are readily available
through local trade channels and would be bought by ADFI borrowers from
suppliers of their own choice. Most international suppliers of such items
are well represented in Iran; competition is keen and servicing reasonable.
ADFI would, however, exclude goods from individual project cost if the
borrower receives a supplier's credit for such goods. Assurance on this
was received during negotiations. Iran has to import most of its require-
ments for heifers and cows of the high quality required under the Project



- 13 -
but there is now a small but increasing volume of local production. According-
ly, although the bulk of dairy and beef livestock under the Project is
expected to be imported, some bred in Iran will probably be procured.
4.19      The majority of tractors between 45 and 65 hp are imported under
a bilateral trade agreement with a non-Bank member country and distributed
through a government-owned company on favorable credit terms. Also, two
companies from Bank member countries have recently received assembly and
manufacturing licenses and are selling their products of a similar power
range in limited numbers. However, other comparable makes and types from
Bank member countries are excluded. The total estimated requirement by
Project sub-borrowers for tractors of this size is not very important,
about 200, and as the Bank's normal requirements for free competition cannot
be met, these would be ineligible for inclusion in sub-project costs for Bank
reimbursement unless specific Bank approval were obtained. Such approval
would only be given if the Bank's requirements for free competition were met.
During negotiations assurances were obtained to this effect.
Disbursement
4.20      With ADFI's commitments extending over two years, its disbursements
would be spread over about three years and Bank disbursement is expected to
cover three and a half years (Annex 9). The Bank would reimburse against
appropriate statements and documents (invoices whenever applicable) 57% of
ADFI's disbursements made for individual loans (i.e., 40% of investment cost)
under the Project up to an amount provided for in each category. Bank dis-
bursements would thus be: Rls 245 million for investment in mixed farming
development; Rls 128 million for orchards; Rls 86 million for dairy operations;
Rls 62 million for sheep operations; Rls 279 million for poultry investments
and Rls 264 million for agro-industry investments. A schedule of estimated
Bank disbursement is given in Annex 9. This schedule takes into account
retroactive financing (not exceeding US$1 million) of disbursements made by
ADFI from October 1971 when the First Loan was fully committed. In the event
the expenditures under any category provided for should decrease, the amount
of the loan allocated to such category and no longer required therefor could
be, at the request of the borrower, reallocated to another category.
V. AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT FUND OF IRAN (ADFI)
General
5.01      ADFI, an autonomous statutory corporation, was established in 1968
to encourage private investment in commercial agriculture, livestock pro-
duction and associated industries by providing credit for medium and long-
term investments and making equity participation in projects which have
been satisfactorily appraised as to their technical feasibility and economic
viability. Its operations are governed by its statute and charter and, as
a banking institution. ADFI is also subject to the Iran Banking and Monetary
Law. ADFI had initially a lower loan limit of Rls 5 million (US$66,000),
which was the upper limit of the Agricultural Cooperative Bank (ACB)



- 14 -
lending to smaller farmers under concessionary terms. ACB's upper loan limit,
and ADFI's lower loan limit have both, however, since been lowered to US$13,000
which enables ADFI to cover a wider range of medium-size farmers. The normal
statutory maximum of ADFI loan and equity investment in a single enterprise
is 25% of ADFI's paid-up capital and reserves.
Resources
5.02      ADFI's authorized share capital is Rls 1,000 million (fully paid-up)
and is shortly to be increased to Rls 2,000 million (US$26.4 million) to be
wholly subscribed by the government. ADFI borrows on short-term from the
Central Bank (Rls 22 million or US$0.3 million outstanding in June 1971) and
it can issue bonds supported by government guarantee, but no use so far has
been made of this facility nor of the possibility of borrowing from the govern-
ment on long-term arrangements.
Use of Resources
5.03      ADFI has been in active operation only for about three years and
while its lending under the First Projiect has been on schedule since loan
effectiveness, activities outside the project (both in lending and equity
participation) were less than anticipated by ADFI. Out of its loan portfolio
of US$6.6 million equivalent (June 20, 1971) about 75% has been under the
First Project while at appraisal it wats expected it would be only 40%. It
is now expected that lending under the! Bank's First and proposed Second
Projects will be ADFI's major activity for some time.
Financial Situation and Expansion
5.04      ADFI as a new organization is increasing its volume of lending.
Because of high overhead cost of professional staff at the time when the
volume of loan business was low, its losses amounted to Rls 12.5 million
(US$165,000) in each of the years 1968/69 and 1969/70 and Rls 7.5 million
(US$100,00f)) in 1970/71. Equity had been contributed to four sub-projects
(amounting to Rls 43 million, or US$567,000) by June 20, 1971. Several
further participations are expected in the future.
5.05      ADFI charges 8% on its loans (inclusive of 1/2 of 1% service
charge) and a 1% commitment fee on undisbursed balances. ADFI proposed that
its standard rate remain unchanged but that for lending to agri-business
projects and for working capital purposes its rates should be increased to
minima of 9% and 10% respectively. On its total operations, including the
Bank Projects, ADFI is forecast to make a small profit by 1974. This, how-
ever, is on a blended cost of capital lower than that which would obtain under
the Second Project alone. An indication of the Second Project's financial
effect on ADFI is shown in Appendix 7-1. In order for ADFI to break even on
project operations a higher interest rate would have been required.
5.06      Because of numerous support measures benefitting essential industrial
activities, domestic terms of trade for agriculture tend to be depressed. The
Government is, however, most concerned that private investments in agriculture
should not be discouraged. It finds ilt therefore inopportune at this time to



- 15 -
go further than the minor rate increases ADFI proposed and raise the minimum
interest rate payable by ADFI's sub-borrowers. Assurances have therefore
been obtained from Government with regard to the provision of low cost and/or
equity capital which should enable ADFI to meet its commitments with regard
to profitability and reserves under the loan agreement starting about 1974.
While, in the light of the earning potential of the contemplated investments,
the Bank would have preferred to see an increase in the minimum interest rate
too at this t4me, the agreement reached provides for a continuing Bank
relationship with a significant part of Iran's agriculture. In the meantime,
more detailed studies of the possibilities and desirability of capital market
development and interest rate adjustments have been initiated.
5.07      ADFI's increased lending program under the Project requires an
increase of its resources beyond its present paid in share capital of
Rls 1,000 million, (para 5.02). Based on the Cash Flow Projections
(Appendices 7-1 and 7-2), an additional Rls 400 million would need to be
subscribed by the government. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that the government would make this amount available to ADFI within 18 months
of loan signature.
Organization and Management
5.08      Under its charter, ADFI's operations are controlled and managed
by a General Assembly (various Ministers and the Managing Director of the
Plan Organization), the High Council or Board of Directors (the Governor of
the Central Bank, Under-Secretaries of various Ministries and technical ex-
perts) and the President, who is the chief executive with wide powers, in-
cluding a veto on loan approval; he is appointed by Royal Decree and is
assisted by an Executive Vice-President, similarly appointed. ADFI has
separate departments in charge of appraisal, loan supervision, economic
research, legal affairs, finance and administration, employing in all about
35 professionals and 25 general administrative staff. Two department heads
had Bank training and all benefitted from an EDI course held in Tehran.
By and large, ADFI is well managed and its staff is very competent.
Lending Policies and Procedures
5.09      ADFI's agricultural staff would assist applicants to prepare
detailed investment plans, defining "Project investment cost" which
would include new investments only. ADFI would finance genuine incremental
working capital requirements only in such cases where the sub-borrowers
can demonstrate that they are not able to make alternative arrangements.
Assurances on this were obtained during negotiations. Individual projects
would be appraised in terms of incremental returns, after being scrutinized
by a technical committee; loan requests would then be presented to the
management for approval. Loans of Rls 20 million and above (US$264,000;
US$200,000 under the First Project) for mixed farming, orchards, dairy and
beef, sheep and poultry would require prior Bank approval. All loans for
other categories would, irrespective of value, also require Bank approval;
these would be mainly for agro-industry projects. ADFI had requested that the
limit of loans requiring prior Bank approval be increased to US$300,000
equivalent. While some increase is justified by ADFI's performance under



- 16 -
the First Project, it was considered advisable to limit the increase to
US$264,000 equivalent so that the Banlk would be kept sufficiently informed
on ADFI's operations and on the use of Bank funds. The above procedures
would not be altered without prior aplproval of the Bank; assurances to this
effect were obtained during negotiations.
5.10      During negotiations amendments to ADFI's Loan Regulations and
Equity Regulations (Appendix 7-5), which define ADFI's overall policy
in some matters not covered by its statute or charter, were agreed upon
between ADFI and the Bank and their implementation would be a condition
of effectiveness. Any changes to these regulations as well as to ADFI's
statute or charter would require the ]3ank's prior approval.
Terms and Conditions of Project Loans
5.11      Sub-borrowers under the Project would be charged an effective
interest rate of 8% per annum including any service or supervision fee. In
addition, sub-borrowers would be chargyed a commitment fee of 1% per annum on
any undrawn loan balance, and bear the foreign exchange risk on repayments
due to the Bank (para 4.16).
5.12      Cash flows of typical sub-borrowers shown in Appendix 8-4 indicate
that the following repayment periods for loans would be appropriate.

Assurances were obtained that these periods would not be exceeded without
the Bank's prior approval.
Accounts and Auditing
5.13      A government inspector, appcointed by the General Assembly on the
recommendation of the Minister of Finance, audits ADFI accounts and certifies
such statements. A firm of international public accountants, Coopers and
Lybrand, which assists him, also independently audits and certifies such
statements, besides advising ADFI on accounting matters. Assurances were
obtained that ADFI would keep separate accounts for: (i) the proposed Project,
(ii) the first Bank project and (iii) its own operations outside these two
projects, and that its accounts would continue to be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank and that the audited accounts and the
auditors' report would be sent to the Bank within four months of the end of
ADFI's fiscal year.

VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, PRICES AND PRODUCERS' BENEFITS
Production
6.01      Under the Project, about 14,000 ha of land would be brought under
cultivation, mostly by way of land development and minor irrigation; about
12,000 ha would be cultivated with annual crops and 1,600 ha of orchards would
be established. In addition to or in combination with the above investments,
loans would be made to establish about 20 new dairy operations of some 100
cows each (total 2,000 cows), largely by importing high value in-calf heifers;
40 loans for sheep production with flocks of about 1,000 ewes each (total
40,000 ewes) and 16 poultry enterprises with about 4.5 million head of poultry
at any one time (at about 5 turnovers per year in case of broiler production).
Further, some 12 loans would be made to process and market agricultural
products by agro-industrial enterprises. The incremental value of annual
production due to these investments would be at full development (two to
eleven years after investment) about Rls 1,030 million (US$14 million) for
primary products alone (excluding the added value through processing). Full
production of each category of investment would be reached at year 3 for
annual crops, year 11 for orchards, year 5 for dairy and sheep and year
2 for poultry. When all investments have reached full maturity an estimated
annual production of about 18,000 ton of wheat, 40,000 ton of alfalfa hay,
48,000 ton of sugarbeet (8,000 ton sugar), 3,600 ton of seed-cotton (1,200
ton of lint), 30,000 ton of citrus, apple or other deciduous fruit, 10,000
ton of milk, 1400 ton of sheep (liveweight) and 26,000 ton of poultry meat
would result (Annexes 2 through 6).
Marketing
6.02      The domestic market can readily absorb the incremental production
arising out of this Project although some amounts of cotton and fruits may
be exported. In case of cotton (Project production, 1,200 ton of medium-
staple lint) higher quality would increase Iran's competitiveness on the
world market while on the other hand local consumption is expected to double
by 1985. Similar substitution is expected in case of sugarbeet which would
replace less effective producers located further from processing plants and
producing under less satisfactory cropping methods (broadcasting instead of
row planting). The effects in those areas which would consequently be planted
to other crops cannot be estimated since it is difficult to forecast what
crops would be produced instead. Iran's imports of agricultural products are
rising quickly and domestic production would need to increase at approximately
twice the rate of the past decade, if increasing deficits are to be avoided.
Domestic demand for wheat products is expected to increase annually by 2.4%
while imports in 1967/68 were of US$18 million equivalent. Local fruit demand
is expected to rise by more than 6% annually and there are good export pos-
sibilities (pistachios, almonds and sultanas to U.S.A. and Europe, fresh
fruits to the Persian Gulf area, for example). Imports of milk products rose
to US$8 million equivalent in 1967/68 and domestic demand until 1985 is ex-
pected to rise by 5.3% annually. Mutton production has in the recent past
shown the most disappointing performance within the livestock sector with
probably no growth at all; demand increase is forecasted at 5.3% annually.



- 18 -
Poultry meat and eggs are expected to rise in demand by 7.4% and 5.3% annually
over the next 15 years (Annex 4).
6.03      These demand projections show the need for increased agricultural
production in the commercial sector since significant production increases
cannot be expected from the traditional sector in the short run (para 2.10).
There is, however, also a great need for expanding and improving processing
and marketing facilities of these products and taking this into consideration,
about one-fourth of total Project costs has been earmarked for agroindustrial
investments.
Prices
6.04      Current prices provide sufficient incentive to farmers and enter-
prises to invest in production activLties included under the Project. The
present price level of these products with the exception of cotton is not
expected to fall in the near future; on the contrary, livestock products,
particularly, are expected to rise because of growing demand and shortage
in domestic supply. With the exceptLon of some fruits and cotton, Project
production is expected to be consumed entirely within Iran. Farm-gate prices
used in farm plans and financial projections are shown in Appendix 8-1.
Producers' Benefits
6.05      On the basis of investment costs, yield and price assumptions,
detailed in five illustrative investment models (Appendix 8-2), incomes
after debt service and before tax liabilities, are estimated to be as
follows at full development:

During the third stage of Iran's land reform, investment in commercial
agriculture was at a low level. Subsequently, the Government introduced the
Income Tax Act in 1967, which embodies measures designed to encourage



- 19 -
agricultural investments, mainly by way of 10-year tax holidays. Sub-
borrowers would, therefore be exempt from income tax for 10 years on income
from their new investments. After that, when in most cases the loan would
be repaid, sub-borrowers would, depending on their total income and the
actual investments financed, pay about 30% tax.
6.06      Farmers' financial benefits have been estimated on the five
illustrative types of enterprises (Appendix 8-2), and show that a substan-
tial net income should result from the proposed investments. The financial
rates of return would be 15% for mixed farming, 23% for orchards, 23% for
sheep, 17% for dairy and 32% for poultry enterprises. To test the sensitivity
of financial returns against varying yields and prices and fluctuation of
investment cost, alternative assumptions have been used which show the
following rates in comparison to the "best estimate". Two kinds of invest-
ments, orchards and poultry, have been, in addition, tested against the risk
of price fluctuations and/or possible disease or frost (oranges). Even if
the net incremental income of those enterprises would drop by 40%, there
would be still a satisfactory income.

40%                    -        14       -      -     17
These returns should provide sufficient incentives to producers to make
the intended investments.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      In the recent past, agriculture's rate of growth has lagged
significantly below the average of the rest of Iran's economy and this
Project, a continuation of the First Project assisted by the Bank, would
further encourage commercial agriculture which had been neglected in recent
years as far as institutional credit was concerned. The increased production
deriving from this Project would improve Iran's balance of payments position,
mainly by reducing its rising imports of agricultural products and to a
lesser extent by improving some of its exports in qualitative terms (fruits,
cotton). Net annual foreign exchange earnings and/or savings attributable
to the Project would reach about US$10 million equivalent, after considering
the cost of imported inputs (estimated at about US$4 million) at the Project's



- 20 -
full development. Additional, but non-quantifiable, benefits would result
mainly from the demonstration effect on non-Project farmers and enterprises.
7.02      By developing and planting about 14,000 ha, the Project would
enlarge the country's agricultural production and processing sector and would
encourage production beyond this by making considerable earnings available for
reinvestment.
7.03      The economic rate of return has been calculated on the basis of
predicted world market prices for 1975 plus an allowance for transportation
cost for the major agricultural products expected to be produced under the
Project, with the exception of alfa:Lfa and milk which have been considered
as "non-tradeable" products and for which expected local prices have been
used.  The Project's overall rate of return to the economy over an average
life of 15 years is estimated at 19%' (Annex 10).
7.04      In calculating Project returns, secondary benefits, such as the
domestic value added by processing piroducts, have not been taken into account.
Social benefits of increasing employment on farms and in processing facili-
ties, which would ease Iran's unemployment problems, also cannot be measured
accurately; it is, however, estimated that the Project would create employment
for about 2,500 persons on a full time basis. These factors tend to enhance
the Project's already satisfactory economic rate of return to the economy.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principle points:
(a)  the Government would, within 18 months of Loan signature,
in addition to the Rls 1,000 million presently paid-up share
capital, make available to ADFI not less than Rls 400 million                 *
in the form of share capital (para 5.07);
(b)  that ADFI would send to the Bank for prior approval all loans
of Rls 20 million (US$264,000) and above for mixed farming,
orchards, dairy and beef, siheep and poultry, and all loans
for other categories irrespective of value (para 5.09);
(c)  no change would be made in ADFI';s statute, charter, loan regula-
tions or equity regulations without prior approval of the
Bank (para 5.10).
8.02      A conditions of effectiveness of the loan would be that ADFI's High
Council has amended the Loan Regulations and Equity Regulations as set out in
Appendix 7-5 as agreed during negotiations (para 5.10).
8.03      The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
to ADFI of US$14.0 million for a term of 12 years including a four-year grace
period.

IRAN
SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Agricultural Background
General
1.        Iran consists mainly of a high interior plateau with an average
height of more than 1,000 m, bounded by mountain ranges in the north (the
Elburz) and the west (the Zagros). It has frontiers with the Soviet Union,
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Turkey. The plateau has a continental
climate with rainfall ranging from 250 mm to nil in the desert areas of
Dasht-i-Kavir and Dasht-i-Lut. The narrow strip of land between the Elburz
mountains and the Caspian Sea has a rainfall of more than 1,000 mm and a
more equable climate, while the plains bordering Iraq and the Persian and
Oman Gulfs have an arid and hot climate (precipitation between 100 and 250 mm
per annum).
2.        Out of Iran's total land area of 165 million ha, less than a quar-
ter (40 million ha) is suitable for agriculture. Currently 19 million ha
are under cultivation but only about 8 million ha are cropped in any one
year, largely because of shortage of water. A further large area of range
lands and hill pastures is used for annual and seasonal grazing, and is con-
sidered to be overstocked under present management systems.
3.        Reconnaissance soil surveys indicate that, of the 40 million ha
considered suitable for agriculture, 6 million ha consist of good alluvial
soils and 8 million ha of brown, chestnut and chernozem soils of moderate to
high productivity.
Irrigation
4.        As 75% of the total cultivable area has an average annual rainfall
of less than 250 mm, shortage of irrigation water in Iran is reflected in
both varying levels of annual production and in the slow rate of adoption
of improved technology.
5.        Currently (1970) only some 0.4 million ha have an assured and ade-
quate supply of irrigation water, mostly from modern (deep) wells.
6.        Some 0.7 million ha are moderately served by "ghanats" (traditional
subterranean groundwater channels) and primitive wells. A further 2 million
ha with inadequate supplies of water, derived mainly from unregulated sea-
sonal surface water runoff, are included in the estimated total of 3.2 mil-
lion ha of irrigated land.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
7.        A negligible amount of irrigation water (about 100,000 ha) is at
present supplied from large dams and plans for extending perennial supplies
of irrigation water are lagging behind schedule, due mainly to delays in the
completion of distribution channels.
Agriculture in the Economy
8.        Whilst Iran's non-oil GNP, grew at 10% per annum during the last
five years, the growth rate in agriculture was probably only around 3%
during the last decade. By 1968/69, the share of agricultural output in
GNP had fallen to 23.7%.
9.        In 1967/68, agricultural exports represented 44% (US$109.8 mil-
lion) of total exports (excluding oil). Although the value of agricultural
exports increased by 9.5% from 1963/64 to 1967/68, their proportion in rela-
tion to total non-oil exports declined. Cotton, hides and leather, fruit
and nuts were the most important commodities exported.
10.       Agricultural imports in 1967/68 were officially estimated at
US$121.2 million, but are considered nearer US$150 million when proper al-
lowance is made for live animal imports from neighboring countries. Account-
ing for 9.0% of total merchandise imports in 1967/68, agricultural imports
have increased by 26.4% over 1963/64 levels. Vegetable oils, wool and ani-
mal hair, wheat and tea were the chief imports in 1967/68.
11.       Iran's population is estimated to total 30 million, with an annual
growth rate of 2.8-3.0%. Of the total labor force of 7.9 million, some 3.2
million (or 40%) were engaged in agriculture, although the agricultural
labor force declined between 1963 and 1968 by 0.7% per annum.
Land Tenure and Land Reform
12.       Between 1962 and 1970, under land reform programs, some 2 million
farm families, previously sharecroppers under a landlord-serf relationship,
have become owners of their land (probably totalling some 5-6 million ha).
13.       Iran's present agrarian structure consists of:
(a) "agribusiness" or large-scale enterprises, farming hold-
ings of 10,000 ha or more, often with foreign participa-
tion in capital and management, which are given priority
for the exploitation of irrigated land under the command
of large dams.
(b) the "commercial sector" composed of former landlords and
large landowners, whose holdings were wholly or partially
excluded from the land reform measures (as orchards, mech-
anized farms, etc.). There are an estimated 100,000 farms
in this category, varying in size from 25 ha to several
hundred ha.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
(c) "Farm Corporations". These are Government-sponsored organ-
izations in which individual villagers make over their land
to the corporation in return for shares. On average, a
farm corporation covers about 300 families and 1,000 ha.
Management is in the hands of technicians of the Ministry
of Land Reform, and farm corporations receive specially
favored treatment in respect of credit, inputs and sup-
porting services. Twenty such farm corporations have been
set up since 1967 and are regarded as being in the experi-
mental stage.
(d) the "village or traditional sector", composed of small
farms with fragmented holdings, together with the transhu-
mant pastoralists. Although now largely owning their own
farms, this group is still largely engaged in subsistence
agriculture, producing occasional and varying surpluses for
the local market.
Agricultural Production
14.       Agricultural production statistics in Iran are unreliable.  There
is however a consensus on the relative trends which they illustrate. Appen-
dix 1-1 gives one set of estimates for agricultural production. These
serve to demonstrate that during the period 1957-59 to 1967-69 livestock
production grew slowly (c. 1.5 percent per annum) with mutton output
remaining static. Overall crop production performed souewhat better (an
annual growth of c. 3.0 per annum) with the highest growth rates being
achieved in sugar, cotton, tea and tobacco. Nevertheless in relation to
domestic market opportunities, investment in irrigation, national endowment
and land reform a better performance in agriculture should be feasible.
15.       Approximately 40% of agricultural output is in livestock products.
The area devoted to the main crops in 1968/69 was as follows:
Crop                      Area Planted       % of Total
Wheat                          4,340              55.6
Barley                         1,185              15.2
Rice                             352               4.5
Cotton                           371               4.8
Sugarbeet                        153               2.0
Sugarcane                          5                -
Oilseeds                          34               0.5
Tea                               36               0.5
Tobacco                           17               0.2
Others (including fruits,
vegetables & misc.)          1,307              16.7
Total                7,800             100.0
The main features of the more important livestock and crop products are
outlined in Annexes 2-6.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
Inputs
16.       Between 1960/61 and 1969, fEertilizer consumption in Iran grew from
38,981 ton to 202,805 ton -- from 15,080 ton to 94,613 ton in terms of
nutrient -- and is expected to double again by 1975.
17.       Domestic production at about 40,000 ton has to be supplemented by
imports. A new factory at Shahpur will at full production have an annual
output of 165,000 ton of urea and 125,000 ton of di-ammonium phosphate. The
Fertilizer Distribution Company (a subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil
Company) is in overall charge of the distribution of fertilizers produced
in Iran which are distributed through private dealers, rural cooperatives,
sugarbeet factories and the promotional organizations for tea, tobacco and
oilseeds.  The rate of expansion of fertilizer consumption depends mainly on
the extension of perennial irrigation and the availability of improved seeds             0
responsive to fertilizer use.
18.       Unfortunately only limited progress has been made in the produc-
tion, multiplication, certification snd distribution of improved seed.
There is only 1% to 2% coverage of the total wheat area, and 18% coverage
of cotton plantings. Although all the area under sugarbeet is sown with
partially improved varieties, these need to be upgraded, particularly as
regards sugar content. Progress in certain other crops (e.g. citrus and
deciduous fruit) is more satisfactory.
19.       Pest control activities are concentrated on anti-locust operations
and spraying against infestation of cotton by bollworm.
Agricultural Services
20.       The ministries and agencies with major agricultural functions in-
clude:
(a)  the Ministry of Agriculture, primarily but not exclusively
concerned with research and extension services;
(b) the Ministry of Cooperation and Rural Affairs (previously
designated the Ministry of Land Reform and Rural Cooperatives),
responsible for the implementation of the land reform program
(now virtually complete) and for assisting rural coopera-
tives and farm corporations (para 13(c) above);
(c)  the Ministry of Natural Resources, responsible for fisher-
ies, forests and range pasturage;
(d)  the Ministry of Agricultural Products and Consumer Goods,
controlling the policy of a number of government corpora-
tions concerned primarily with the marketing and price
stabilization of certain agricultural products;



ANNEX 1
Page 5
(e) the Ministry of Water and Power as the Ministry responsible
for the development of water and power resources, control
of irrigation development; and
(f) autonomous agencies have been set up to handle specific matters
either on a commodity basis (as, for example, in the case of
tea, tobacco and oilseeds) or a functional basis (e.g. ma-
chinery bonga handling the distribution and credit sales of
Rumanian tractors).
21.       Extension services, although primarily the responsibility of the
Ministry of Agriculture, are also provided by some specialized agencies.
The numbers and quality of field staff could be improved. Recently, over
3,000 servicemen doing their national service have been trained and utilized
as additional village extension workers.
Future Problems and Policies
22.       The disappointing performance of the agricultural sector does not
reflect a lack of potential or opportunities. Although export market pros-
pects are in general limited, there are major opportunities for expanding
Iranian production to meet rising domestic demand, notably for livestock and
dairy products and fruit. Unless these opportunities are grasped, food im-
ports will constitute a growing burden on the balance of payments.
23.       The land reform measures successfully implemented in the past
decade have paved the way for the emergence of a broadly based commercially-
oriented agricultural sector; but in the process, problems have been
encountered which have contributed to the rather slow rate of the agricul-
tural sector. Government services and institutional credit did not expand
fast enough to fill the gap in the provision of inputs and production credit
previously supplied by landlords. Similarly, uncertainty as to Government's
intentions reduced the willingness of the remaining large landowners in the
commercial sector to invest in agriculture.
24.       There are other constraints to increasing agricultural production.
Undoubtedly the major constraint in Iran is the relatively small area of
fully irrigated land. As this is alleviated by speeding up the construction
of distribution networks from completed dams and by encouraging more invest-
ment in modern wells other impediments to development will also need to
be removed or their influence modified. Among these are the need for (i) a re-
view of agricultural price policy to provide producer incentives sometimes
leading to greater regional specialization; (ii) strengthening coordination
among certain government ministries and state organizations serving agri-
culture; (iii) improving research administration and direction in order to
identify research priorities in terms of national economic needs; (iv) mo-
dernizing the transhumance-based livestock sector; and (v) expanding market-
ing and processing facilities.
25.       Current government policy favors a two-pronged approach to the
problem of increasing agricultural production. The need to strengthen the

infrastructure and supporting services for the traditional or village sector
is recognized, but because of the nature of the problems involved it is
realized that this can at best produce results in the medium and long term.
In the short run, therefore, emphasis is also being placed on the devel-
opment of agribusiness and the commercial sector, with farm corporations as
an experiment in a new form of agrarian structure.

The Crop Sector
General
1.        The relative importance of the main crops produced in Iran is in-
dicated by the statistics in the following table:
Crop                                         Area Planted 1968/69
(in '000 ha)

Source: Ministry of Agriculture.
2.        Since most of the wheat and barley is grown for on-farm consump-
tion, their production is widely distributed with 60% under dry-farming con-
ditions. Two-thirds of the rice and half the cotton are grown in the Caspian
area; production of other crops is widespread with varying yields and qual-
ity. In general, increases in production in recent years have come from
expansion of the planted area rather than from improved yields. This is
largely due to slow increases in the area under full irrigation and in use
of improved seeds and fertilizer. Other constraints to production growth
have been outlined in Annex 1.
Detailed Crop Features
(a) Wheat and Barley
3.        Wheat and barley occupy a predominant position in the subsistence
farming sector and expansion of production from dry-farming areas will be
slow. Although the overall projected annual rate of growth of demand for
wheat is estimated at 2.4% or somewhat lower than the expected rate of pop-
ulation growth, urban areas will account for nearly 50% of the total in-
crease in demand. Government policy is based on the premise that this de-



ANNEX 2
Page 2
mand can best be met by extending commercial, market-oriented production in
favorable areas, such as Khorasan, Kermanshahah, Hamadan and North Khuzestan.
(b) Rice
4.        In the main growing area (Caspian), yields, although improving,
are low; only one crop a year is possible and autumn rains can make harvest-
ing difficult. The local long-grain variety (Sadri) is late maturing and
not particularly responsive to fertilizer, but it sells at a considerable
premium (66%) over more productive varieties.
5.        Demand for rice is expected to grow at an annual rate of 3.9%, but
increases in production may well have to come from other areas than the
Caspian, where there are many other land-use possibilities.  Rice imports
have risen greatly from 148 ton in 1957-1959 to 17,268 ton in 1967-1969.
(c) Cotton
6.        The area under cotton has varied about an average level of 360,000
ha over the last 10 years, with two-thirds coming from Mazandaran (the
eastern Caspian area). Yields, although improving, at 1.5 ton of seed cot-
ton per ha are low because one-third of the crop is grown in unirrigated
land and crop husbandry is poor (broDadcasting instead of planting in rows,
border rather than furrow irrigation, inadequate pest control and absence of
proper crop rotations).
7.        Domestic demand is expected to grow at over 4% per annum, but the
prospects for exports are less bright. Although cotton exports nearly doubled
in the decade 1957-1959 to 1967-196'9 to a level of over 80,000 ton cotton
lint, they are almost entirely takeni by Eastern European countries under bi-
lateral trade agreements. As it is possible, according to FAO forecasts,
that these countries will be self-sufficient in cotton by 1975, it would then
be difficult for Iran to find altenlative markets, particularly in view of
the poor quality and relatively high average production costs of Iranian cot-
ton and the prospects of declining world market prices.
8.        Concentration of production in more favorable areas, such as
Khorasan, with improved husbandry techniques to increase yields and reduce
costs, coupled with contraction elsewhere is the likely future trend of cot-
ton production in Iran.
(d) Sugar
9.        Sugar output expanded from 50,000 ton in 1960 to 530,000 ton in
1969, while imports fell from about 300,000 ton to 60,000 ton over the
same period. Of the 1969 production, 480,000 ton came from sugarbeet pro-
duced on 160,000 ha of irrigated land at a low average yield of 22 ton per
ha, while 50,000 ton were extracted from cane grown on 5,000 ha in Khuzestan,
with high yields of around 100 ton per ha.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
10.       Reasons for low yields of sugarbeet include inadequate soil prepa-
ration and irrigation, seed broadcasting rather than sowing in rows, limited
use of fertilizer and insufficient rotational systems. In the Mashad area,
however, yields up to 60 ton per ha are obtained under good mechanized
farming methods.
11.       The rapid expansion of sugarbeet production in the last decade
was due to a purposive and concentrated research, extension and credit ef-
fort, backed by a profitable producer price. For the next stage, it will
be necessary to encourage (i) concentration of production in more favorable
areas; (ii) higher sugar content through varietal improvement and pricing
policy; (iii) use of tops and pulp for animal feed; (iv) greater processing
efficiency, including full use of molasses now largely wasted. Even with
such improvements, an expansion of the cane area at the expense of sugarbeet
would probably be justified.
(e) Oilseeds
12.       Imports of vegetable oils increased from 9,015 ton in 1957-1959 to
107,688 ton in 1967-1969 and oilseed imports went up from 723 ton to 4,245
ton over the same period. Cotton seed oil (about 45,000 ton in 1969) has been
the main domestic source of supply. Demand is expected to grow at an annual
rate of 3.7%.
13.       In 1966, an Oil Seed Research and Development Company was estab-
lished with the target of achieving self-sufficiency in oilseed production
by 1980. Contracts on the lines of those operated by sugarbeet factories
are given to farmers willing to grow sunflowers, soybeans or safflower, who
are then provided with seed, fertilizer, pesticides and spraying equipment
together with technical assistance and working capital.
14.       Response to date has been good and the bulk of the contracts have
been with small farmers. ADFI has played an important part in mobilizing
commercial bank resources to meet the expanding working capital needs under
the development scheme.
(f) Vegetables
15.       As urbanization increases, domestic demand for vegetables will
grow at an estimated annual rate of 4.3%. In addition, specialized oppor-
tunities for export to Persian Gulf States and to European markets may well
be exploited. One of the "agribusiness" enterprises established under the
Dez irrigation scheme (H.N. Iran and America Company) is already sending
experimental consignments of asparagus to Germany. Such ventures call for a
closely controlled and coordinated production, harvesting, processing, pack-
ing and air-freighting program that can best be undertaken at this stage by
an integrated commercial enterprise.
(g) Fodder Crops
16.       Sown fodder crops are at present grown in Iran to a very limited
extent only. Under irrigation, alfalfa, indigenous to Iran, can yield 15
to 20 ton of hay per ha of good quality feed on an economical basis.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
17.       To meet projected livestock requirements, a substantial increase
in irrigated fodder crop production will be needed. -
Role of Large-scale Farm Enterprises in the Crop Sector
18.       As indicated in the preceding paragraphs, the immediate need in
Iran is increased market-oriented production with greater regional special-
ization to make possible reductions; in unit costs.
19.       The policy of the Iranian government is to encourage investment in
agriculture by large-scale enterprises considered capable of achieving such
results in the short term through the use of modern methods and improved
techniques.  These would include latnd levelling and land preparation, exten-
sion of improved irrigation facilities and mechanization of operations, as
well as the adoption of better husbandry practices and use of improved seeds,
fertilizers and other inputs.
20.       It is on these grounds that the government has decided to allocate
the greater part of the area of newly irrigated land under the command of
dams (e.g. at Dez) in large-scale concessions to "agribusiness" enterprises,
which often have some participation by foreign capital and management.
21.       In addition to the short-term results in the form of immediate
increased production, it is hoped that large-scale farms will act as examples
and catalysts in helping to bring about similar changes in the other sectors
of the agricultural economy. In appropriate cases, marketing and processing
facilities operated by larger units could also handle the production of
smaller farmers on contract terms.
Project Considerations
22.       In the first three years of its operations (i.e., to September 22,
1971), ADFI made very few loans specifically for annual crops. However,
arable farming was a component of a large number of other types of loan. As
shown in Annex 5, combination of sheep and arable farming in an integrated
operation represents a first step in livestock improvement. Moreover,
arable operations constitute the major part of "agribusiness" ventures
financed by ADFI.
23.       Through its insistence on better farm management and on the intro-
duction of improved methods of crop husbandry as conditions of loans already
made, ADFI is assisting in raising productivity in the commercial farming
sector.
24.       In future, ADFI, as an instrument of government policy, may be
expected to orient its lending policy to further the desired changes in
specific crop production outlined in paragraphs 3 to 17 above.  Thus, farm
plans for annual crop loans are likely to include only sugarbeet and cotton
as part of the rotation and in such areas where concentration of production



ANNEX 2
Page 5
is justified on yield and cost grounds. Similarly, and especially from agri-
business enterprises, ADFI financing will promote increases in the output of
alfalfa (to meet expanding demand of the livestock sector), and vegetables for
both domestic and export markets, as well as wheat for the urban market.
25.       Although it represents a possible farm enterprise based solely on
annual crops, and shows this to give a satisfactory financial rate of return
of 15%, the farm model at Appendix 8-2 must be taken as primarily illustra-
tive in character and purpose. In practice, as already explained, arable
crop operations under ADFI loans are more likely to be combined with other
activities (e.g. livestock on smaller farms, processing and storage in the
case of larger units). Economies resulting from such integration will make
the rate of return from a combined venture greater than the average of the
separate rates for the component parts.

Production
1.        Although milk production in Iran is estimated to have grown from
1,573,000 tons in 1957-59 to 1,997,000 tons in 1967-69 (an annual growth rate
of 2.4%), this failed to match increasing consumption, as evidenced by the
rise in the imports of milk products. Over the same period, imports of
powdered milk went up from 916 tons to 3,965 tons butter from 323 tons to
2,881 tons and cheese from 91 tons to 905 tons.
2.        Iran's national herd is estimated to comprise some 32 million
sheep, 13 million goats, and 5 million cattle. Sheep and goats provide
some 40% of the production of milk and milk products. Most of the sheep and
goats are kept under transhumant conditions by tribal pastoralists who move
with their animals from lowland winter pastures to summer highland grazing.
3.        Local breeds of cattle have evolved as triple-purpose (meat, milk
and draft) animals capable of surviving under low nutritional standards and
resistant to local disease (notably, foot and mouth disease and tuberculosis).
Their milk output is low (about 1,600 kg per cow in 245 days with a fat con-
tent of 4.5%).
4.        The main increase in milk production in recent years has come from
the intensive dairy units, mostly near Teheran. About 15,000 pure-bred
dairy cattle, chiefly Holstein-Friesians, have been imported during the last
10 years, mostly from Israel, Holland, U.K. and the USA and often by air at
a landed cost of US$900 to US$1,000 per head. In these commercial units,
the animals are continuously yarded and hand-fed, and feed requirements
(alfalfa, sugarbeet, pulp, cottonseed cake and concentrates) are generally
bought in.
Demand
5.        Demand projections for milk products in 1975 as compared with con-
sumnption levels in 1968 are as follows:

6.        These figures agree broadly with projections made by ADFT's Eco-
nomic Research Department puting the total demand in 1975 (in terms of un-
processed milk) at between 3,121,000 and 3,646,000 tons.
7.        Under present patterns of consumer preference, yogurt, made in
small local dairies is the most common form of milk product. Cheese, butter
and ghee (animal oil) are primarily processed in traditional ways.
Prices and Marketing
8.        There are a variety of marketing and distribution channels, reflect-
ing the different production methods. In the villages and rural areas, sheep's
milk is produced for local consumption as part of a largely subsistence-type
economy. Cow's milk is of greater significance in urban areas. Some cows
are still kept inside city limits but most liquid milk is produced from out-
side herds and trucked into small dairies making yogurt or processing
plants. Distribution is in the hands of marketing guilds, and this and the
small quantities of fluid milk purchased at a time (quarter-liter containers              *
are common) adds to marketing difficulties.
9.        There are two dairy processing plants in Tehran:  one government-
owned with a capacity of 180 ton per day and the other privately-owned
(with foreign participation) with a capacity of 30 ton. In other large
cities, there are 10 small plants with daily capacities of less than 50 ton.
Total plant capacity is about 93,000 tons per year, of which at present only
about 68,000 ton is utilized.
10.       In Tehran, however, the capacity of the two processing plants is
insufficient to handle the growing output of the large commercial dairy
farms.  Under consideration are two alternative plans to deal with this sit-
uation, viz.
(a) to transfer ownership and operation of the government plant
to private enterprise which, with shift working and greater
efficiency, should increase its throughput, or



ANNEX 3
Page 3
(b) to leave this plant under government management, but au-
thorize the establishment of a third plant by private en-
terprise.
11.       Milk prices are controlled by the Ministry of Agricultural Products
and Consumer Goods. Prices to farmers average Rls 11 per liter delivered
factory, with slight seasonal variation and adjustment for butter fat con-
tent. Commercial dairy producers sell on contract with specified quantities,
and under present circumstances in Tehran have to accept lower prices for
deliveries in excess of contract amounts.
12.       Retail prices are fixed at Rls 18 for liter containers and Rls 20
per liter for quarter-liter containers. About 20% of the selling price is
allocated for distribution and 10% represents the retailers' margin.
13.       Prices to the dairy farmer are relatively high (reflecting the
high cost of dairying enterprises based on imported cows). This, together
with the government policy keeping consumer prices low, has squeezed distri-
bution margins leaving little opportunity for market promotion schemes.
Likely Future Developments
14.       Even with the adoption of better husbandry practices for sheep
(Annex 5), it is unlikely that there will be any major increase in milk
from sheep. Climatic conditions favor grassland dairy in the Caspian area,
where 100,000 ha of degenerate forest is being reclaimed by the Ministry of
Natural Resources. Proposals have been made for part of this reclaimed
land to be used for dairying enterprises, utilizing improved local breeds of
cattle that are expected to produce 3,000 liters of milk per lactation.
Such developments would need to be supplemented by appropriate facilities
in the producing areas for milk collecting and processing and for distribu-
tion of milk and milk products to main consuming centers such as Tehran.
The inherent cheaper production costs under such a system should outweigh
the additional cost of transfer from processing plants to the consuming
areas.
Project Considerations
15.       There will inevitably be delays in the implementation of any de-
velopments of the kind outlined in the preceding paragraph. In the mean-
time, increase in milk production to meet a rapidly growing demand (particu-
larly in urban areas) will come from the establishment of new and/or the
expansion of existing commercial dairy enterprises.
16.       In Tehran, processing capacity needs to be expanded, and this may
well itself provide opportunities for private sector investment. In other
cities, there is under-utilized plant capacity, often due to vested inter-
ests in distribution.
17.       The project contains 20 new dairy loans with a total investment
cost of Ris 216 million, representing 8% of total project costs.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
The Poultry Sector
Production
1.        Between 1962 and 1969, production of eggs from commercial (inten-
sive) units rose from 660 tons to 37,100 tons, and during the same period,
production of poultry meat from such units increased nearly four-fold from
7,200 tons to 28,000 tons (Appendix 4-1). By 1969, commercially produced
eggs amounted to 48% and commercially produced poultry meat to nearly 70%
of total supplies of those commodities.
2.        The size of individual intensive poultry units varies greatly;
between 2,000 and 100,000 layers in the case of egg producers, and outputs
of 1,000 to 200,000 or more per batch in the case of broiler producers.
The bulk of intensive poultry units are located around Tehran.
3.        Local hatcheries supply day-old chicks originating from imported,
improved laying and broiler strains. Numbers of hatcheries' parent stock
increased from 80,000 in 1962 to 250,000 in 1968, but some hatching eggs
and day-old chicks are imported.
4.        Two large feed-mixing plants provide about 35% of the total formu-
lated poultry rations. A number of smaller plants are in operation and about
20% of producers mix their own feed, partly because of doubts as to the qual-
ity and consistency of commercial feeds and partly because of their high
cost up to Rls 10,000 (US$125) per ton for layers' mash and Ris 11,250
(US$150) per ton for broilers' mash.
Demand
5.        Demand projections for poultry products vary considerably.  Those
made by ADFI's Economic Research Department put the annual rate of increase
at 14.2% for poultry meat and 8.2% for eggs, whereas the Bank's Agricultural
Sector Survey mission adopted lower levels of 7.4% for poultry meat and 5.3%
for eggs. There is, however, general agreement that consumption of poultry
products in Iran will continue to grow at high rates, particularly in view
of the difficulties that will be encountered in meeting the demand for other
livestock products (Annex 5).
6.        On the basis of the more conservative estimates of the Bank Agri-
cultural Sector Survey, between 1968 and 1975, poultry meat consumption
would increase from 48,500 ton to 85,700 ton and consumption of eggs would
grow from 50,300 ton to 74,200 ton.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
Prices and Marketing
7.        As shown by the tables at: Appendix 4-2, there is considerable
seasonal fluctuation in the prices of poultry products in Iran. In the case of
production from flocks kept on traditional farms, these fluctuations reflect
the normal seasonality of production. To this is added irregularity in
output from commercial farms due to marketing and storage inadequacies and
variations in feed costs.
8.        There is at present only one important slaughter and dressing
plant, located in the Tehran area but serving other cities and the Persian
Gulf area. Only about 30% of the commercial production of broilers are
slaughtered before being retailed, partly because of hygiene deficiencies
in the distribution system and partly because of custom preference for
fresh-killed poultry.
Project Considerations
9.        As an easily expanded source of food production, additional com-
mercial poultry units will be established around the main urban centers to
meet the growing demand. Probably more will be located at centers other
than Tehran in the future. From the model at Appendix 8-2, the financial
rate of return on investment in a 20,000 batch size broiler project would
be 32%. Similar calculations for parent stock enterprises (hatcheries)
producing day-old chicks for layer and broiler units and for layer units
themselves showed correspondingly h:Lgh financial rates of return. Project
costs have been calculated on the broiler model but actual lending is ex-
pected to embrace all categories.
10.       Because of their multiplier effect, the numbers of new hatcheries
will need to be coordinated both with expected increases in the demand for
poultry meat and eggs, and the quantities of hatching eggs and day-old chicks
that are imported.
11.       As output expands, there will be other opportunities for investments
in slaughterhouse, cold storage and distribution facilities, which should
help reduce some of the present unduly high inter-seasonal price fluctua-
tions. Allowance for such possible investments has been made in the project
cost provision for agro-industrial type lending.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
The Sheep, Swine and Other Livestock Sector
Demand
1.        Demand projections made by the Bank, estimate that the consumption
of red meat in Iran will rise from the 1968 level of 336,500 tons to some
500,000 tons in 1975. 1/ Mutton represents more than three quarters of total
red meat consumption.
Production
2.        Over the last decade, mutton production is estimated to have
remained static at around 229,000 ton, but beef output has increased from
58,000 to 76,000 ton (a 2.9% annual rate of growth), largely due to beef
produced as a by-product by commercial dairy herds (Annex 3).
3.        Because of production shortfalls in the face of steadily rising
demand, meat imports have increased considerably. Official Iranian trade
statistics show that meat imports rose from an average of 161 tons in 1957/
1959 to 949 tons in 1967/69. In addition there is a considerable unrecorded
influx of live sheep from Afghanistan and Turkey, estimated by the Agricul-
tural Sector Survey mission at 30,000 tons per annum.
4.        The stagnation of local production is largely due to the fact
that the bulk of the sheep and goats are managed under transhumant systems
by tribalists, who regard their flocks and herds as stores of wealth rather
than working assets. Highland rangelands are overstocked and degenerating
and lowland winter pasture areas are being progressively reduced by the
expansion of dry farming and by irrigation projects.
5.        The national herd is estimated at 32 million sheep, 13 million goats
and 5 million cattle (triple-purpose breeds used as draught animals as well
as for meat and milk production). Productivity is low, with an annual
offtake estimated at only 20% for sheep and 35% for goats, and a slaughter
age ranging between one and two years for male sheep and goats.
6.        There are at least 20 different breeds of sheep in Iran, with
broad tail varieties predominating. Experimental work suggests that upgrading
of local stock by selection could produce satisfactory reproductive and growth
characteristics, although it would of necessity take time.
1/   This is also the average of the high and low projections (537,000 tons
and 462,000 tons) made by ADFI's Economic Research Department.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
7.        The livestock sector also supplies raw material for the carpet
industry, which is a major foreign exchange earner as well as providing em-
ployment for members of pastoral families.  Wool and hair production has
remained static at about 41,000 tons per annum, whereas imports rose from an
average of 2,462 tons in 1957/59 to 9,142 tons in 1967/69.
8.        There is a small but growing pig industry in Iran as evidenced by
the official slaughter statistics, which show that the numbers of hogs
slaughtered increased from 7,504 in 1960 to 14,651 in 1969. Around Tehran
and Isfahan, several large-scale intensive swine projects have recently been
established, frequently as part of integrated enterprises controlling
slaughter-house, processing and retail outlet facilities. Such piggeries
have to be licensed annually by the local authority and difficulties over
license renewals sometimes arise allegedly on health grounds, but probably
based on religious considerations.  Most herds are of local breeds that were
originally imported from Russia; although a few large projects have arranged
for the import of improved breeding stock from European sources.
Prices and Marketing
9.        Meat prices are controlled by the Ministry of Agricultural Products
and Consumer Goods, largely with the aim of keeping urban consumer prices low.
For carcass weight sheep, the current official wholesale price in Tehran is
between Rls. 90 and Rls. 135 per kg and is not allowed to fall below Rls. 75
per kg. Although the official mark-up is Rls 10 per kg retail prices are
frequently Rls. 20 and more above tlhe wholesale price.
10.       Iran has 373 registered slaughterhouses, mostly poor in standard,
handling about 6.6 million head of animals or 45% of total estimated
slaughterings. The slaughterhouse Ln Tehran, with an annual capacity of
60,000 ton has fairly modern facilities. Although owned by the municipality,
the actual slaughtering is controlled by the Beef Syndicate for cows, water
buffalo and beef animals, and by the Meat Organization (of the Ministry of
Agricultural Products and Consumer Goods) in the case of sheep and goats.
Separate slaughterhouses handle pigs and poultry.
11.       Most livestock are driven or transported live for slaughter at
consuming centers, including Tehran,, mainly because of consumer preference
and inadequate facilities for slaughtering in producing areas and for trans-
portation of carcass meat. But opposition to change also comes from the
vested interests involved in the present system which operates to the detriment
of the producer.
Future Developments
12.       Improvement in livestock production in Iran calls for a number of
far-reaching developments. On the management side, there should be separation
of breeding and fattening processes, greater production and utilization of
fodder during the fattening process, leading to reduction of over-grazing of



ANNEX 5
Page 3
rangelands and their progressive regeneration. Concurrently, selective
breeding for stock improvement and rationalization of marketing channels are
needed.
13.       Clearly, because of the socio-economic problems involved, these
can only be regarded as long-term aims. In the interim, possibilities exist
for the development of sheep projects in Azerbaijan, utilizing irrigated land
from the Aras and Miandoab dams to provide winter feed ewes and fattening
rations for lambs. Slaughterhouses established in the producing areas would
he owned by farmers and act as extension centers for the spread of improved
breeding stock and management systems.
Project Considerations
14.       All sheep production loans by ADFI have been associated with annual
crop farms under management systems involving limited rangeland grazing,
maximum utilization of stubble and sugarbeet tops, together with production
of alfalfa for feeding while the flock is confined during the winter and
for lamb fattening. Ventures of this kind incorporate many of the improve-
ments that should be more generally adopted in the long-term.
15.       The model for a sheep project in Appendix 8-2 has been constructed
on the assumption that production will not be in conjunction with other
cropping, so that all feed has been shown at "bought in" prices. Even on
this basis, the financial return is at the rate of 23%.
16.       Included in project costs are 40 sheep sub-projects, with total
investments of Rls. 156 million representing 6% of total project costs.
If, as is probable, most of these sheep projects are combined with annual
crops, a proportion (say, one half) of crop loan costs would need to be
included. Sheep-cum-crop loans would then account for Rls. 462 million
or 17-1/2% of total project costs.
17.       A similar satisfactory rate of return is expected from swine projects.
However, their numbers are likely to be small for the reasons outlined in
para 8 above.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
The Fruit Sector
General
1.        In 1967-69, by value, fruit represented over Rls 36 billion (US$
215 million) or 11% of total agricultural production, with dates, grapes and
citrus fruit (mainly oranges), the most important items. Fruit exports
totalled Rls 1.2 billion (US$16 million) representing 19% of total agricultural
exports, with sultanas and raisins and pistachio nuts predominating.
2.        Future domestic demand prospects for fruit are considered good with
a projected annual rate of growth of demand of more than 6%, whilst export
market prospects for pistachios, almonds and sultanas are also considered
bright.
3.        Summaries of the position in respect of major fruit products likely
to be included in ADFI's future lending program are given below.
Citrus Fruit
4.        There are two distinct citrus producing areas in Iran:  15,000 ha
in the Caspian coastal strip and 10,000 ha in the south, mostly in Fars
(5,000 ha) and Kerman (3,000 ha). Oranges account for the bulk of citrus
production.
5.        Production in the Caspian area is poor in quality and suffers from
lack of sunshine, frost dangers in winter, and high water table. Little or
no expansion is expected in this area, particularly since better growing
conditions exist in the south (notably in Fars and Jiroft), provided irrigation
water is available.
6.        Improved planting material is available and sour orange or troyer
citrange is normally used as root stock. Spacing at intervals not closer
than 6 m x 8 m (187 per ha) and improved pruning practices are necessary to
ensure optimum yields at full production (i.e., from the eleventh year on-
wards). Such yields should exceed 18 tons of oranges per ha and 25 tons of
grapefruit per ha.
7.        Production, which rose to 45,000 tons in 1962, fell in the next two
years on account of frost damage in the Caspian area. By 1969, it was esti-
mated to have recovered to 52,000 tons.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
8.        The bulk of citrus production is purchased at sight and on the tree
by middlemen (Barfarosh). Prices vary according to the time of purchase
(which affects the risks involved); advance payments are made and the balance
of the agreed price paid at the time of harvest. Picking and transport costs
are borne by the middleman.
9.        There is considerable inter-seasonal price fluctuation.  Municipal-
ities endeavor to exert a degree of consumer price control but often in a
way that discourages storage for off-season sale.
10.       In Iran at present there are some 18 fruit and vegetable processing
plants. Small in size (520 tons per factory on average), they have unsophis-
ticated production lines and short production runs, which, together with the
high cost of packing materials, make for high production costs. Such plants
where not part of integrated enterprises, usually enter into forward contracts
with growers at prices higher than those offered by middlemen for fresh fruit.
Pistachio Nuts
11.       Average annual output of pistachio nuts for the years 1967/69 at
9,000 tons was more than double that: for the period 1957/59 (4,000 tons). The
main growing center is Kerman, with smaller production from Ghazvin and
Azerbaijan.
12.       It is an exigent crop, taking 15 years to reach maturity, requiring
careful pest control and having high harvesting costs (one worker can only
gather about 20 kg per day). Planted at spacing of 6 x 6 meters, pistachio
yields an average of 2.5 kg per tree or 700 kg per ha, selling at Rls. 90
per kg.
13.       Annual domestic consumption is at the 4,000-ton level, and in 1969
6,388 tons were exported at a value of US$8.0 million. Export market prospects
are considered excellent and fully able to absorb Iran's exportable surplus
from a projected production of 40,000 tons in 1975.
Deciduous Fruit
14.       There appear to be favorable opportunities for increasing the
production of deciduous fruit, notably apples and pears, and considerable new
plantings are taking place in Azerbaijan, Khorassan, near Tehran and
Isfahan.
15.       Apples, in particular, grow well, are less subject to frost damage
and have low irrigation requirements. Golden delicious and red delicious are
the most popular varieties and adequate planting material is available.
Investment costs and returns are roughly comparable to those for citrus.
16.       Marketing arrangements and difficulties are similar to those
applying to citrus (paras 8 thru 10 above). In addition, when consumer prices
rise unduly, imports are permitted (as in March 1971).



ANNEX 6
Page 3
Project Considerations
17.       ADFI loans to orchard enterprises have covered the establishment
of deciduous fruit (mostly apples), citrus orchards and other fruit,
including dates, bananas and pistachio.
18.       Ilaving regard to their good market prospects and production potential,
similar types of orchard project, covering in all 1,550 ha, with a combined
investment cost of Rls 320 million have been included in the project and
represent 12% of the total lending program.
19.       At Annex 8 (Appendix 8-2) an investment model for a 50 ha citrus
orchard has been developed which shows a financial rate of return of 23%.
Calculations for a deciduous fruit orchard of corresponding size give similar
results.
20.       In addition, it is anticipated that investment opportunities in fruit
storage and processing will arise (most likely as part of integrated enter-
prises) and these have been allowed for in the provision for agro-industrial
lending by ADFI under the project.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Agricultural Development Fund of Iran
1.        The Agricultural Development Fund of Iran (ADFI) was established
in 1968, as an autonomous statutory organization, to encourage private
investment in commercial agriculture, livestock production and allied indus-
tries by providing medium- and long-term credit and equity participation in
projects which have been satisfactorily appraised as to their technical
feasibility and economic viability. Its operations are governed by its
statute and its charter and, in banking aspects, by the Banking and Monetary
Law of Iran.

2.        ADFI is wholly government-owned and has an authorized share capital
of Rls 1,000 million (US$13.2 million) which is fully paid up. The authorized
share capital is shortly to be increased to Rls 2,000 million (US$26.4 million).
ADFI has extensive borrowing powers. On government guarantee, ADFI can borrow up
to US$200 million equivalent from foreign sources and issue local tax-free bonds
up to Rls 5,000 million (US$66 million). It can also obtain credit from the
Central Bank and commercial banks and accept time deposits of not less than
two years' maturity.
3.        ADFI has so far borrowed only from the Bank (662-IRN of US$6.5
million) and the Central Bank of Iran (Rls 22 million or US$0.3 million out-
standing on June 20, 1971). From the latter, ADFI obtained advances against
its borrowers' promissory notes (at 6% interest) and has, currently, an
overdraft arrangement against government bonds (at 10% interest as against
8% received on bonds). The ADFI has not raised resources in any other form,
e.g., bonds or time deposits.
4.        ADFI is required by its Charter to operate commercially.  Though
its profits are taxable, tax so paid is to be applied by government for further
subscription to the ADFI's share capital.
Organization and Management
5.        ADFI's General Assembly, which is its highest authority, comprises
six MSinisters - of Agriculture (Chairman), Finance, Water and Power, Agricul-
tural Products and Consumer Goods, Cooperation and Rural Affairs, and
National Resources, and the Managing Director of the Plan Organization. The
General Assembly approves the annual accounts and reviews the annual report on
its operations.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
6.        ADFI's High Council, which is the equivalent of the board of
directors has three ex-officio members, viz., the Governor of the Central
Bank of Iran (Chairman), the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Agriculture,
and the Assistant Managing Director of the Plan Organization and six members
who are to be experienced experts in agriculture, economics, banking, finance,
and law.  Of the latter, five happen to be government officials, while the
sixth is a retired banker who is also an economist. The High Council meets
usually once a month and determines ADFI's general policy, including matters
such as interest rates and approves its loan and other regulations, the bud-
get, appointment of independent auditors, etc.  The President and Executive
Vice-President are non-voting particilpants in the meetings of the High
Council.
7.        Proposals for provision by ADFI, of loans, equity participation
and guarantees are approved by the Loan Committee which consists of the
President (who has veto powers) and four specified members of the High
Council.
8.        The President of ADFI is the highest executive and administrative
authority and is appointed for three years by Royal Decree on the recommenda-
tion of the Ministry of Agriculture and the approval of the Council of
Ministers. He is assisted and deputized for by an Executive Vice-President
who is appointed similarly. This latter position, which was vacant at the
time of the appraisal of the first Bank loan, has been subsequently filled.
9.        There are separate departments in charge of project appraisal,
loan supervision, economic research, legal affairs, finance and administra-
tion, employing in all about 35 profesisionals and 25 general administrative
staff. Two of the department heads received facilities for training at the
Bank and several other staff were trained in a special course conducted for
them at Teheran by EDI. By and large, the staff in charge of project
appraisal and supervision is competent.
10.       ADFI has no office outside l'ehran.  However, in view of the
anticipated geographical dispersal and expansion of its loan operations, up
to eight provincial branches are proposed to be organized over the next three
years, each with two appropriate professionals and the necessary clerical
assistance.
11.       ADFI staff requirements are estimated to increase appreciably
in the next two years, in view of the proposed opening of branches and
the likely increase in the volume and number of loans. Early steps have,
therefore, to be taken for the recruitment and training of new staff.
12.       An agricultural economist was employed to serve, for a year, as
adviser to ADFI's President and to provide guidance to ADFI staff in
developing techniques of project appraisal and supervision. The cost of
this consultant was financed from the First Bank loan.



ANNEX 7

Lending Policies and Procedures
13.       Loans, which are made only on the basis of projects submitted and
appraised in detail, may, according to ADFI loan regulations, be up to 60%
of the project cost (50% where the land held is leasehold). However, be-
cause of the manner in which the borrower's contribution is assessed, (ADFI
includes previous investments for the same kind of production in its project
cost) the effective proportion of ADFI financing can be, in practice, higher.
Fixed assets form the usual security for loans. Appraisal is undertaken after
a loan request is cleared for the purpose on a preliminary scrutiny. The
appraisal teams consist of persons with the requisite professional background
and their reports cover adequately the technical and economic aspects of the
projects and help base loan decisions on estimated repayment capacity from
income generated by the proposed investment.
14.       The minimum size of loans which could ordinarily be made by the
Fund was initially Rls 5 million (US$66,000), but has been reduced to
Rls 1 million (US$13,000) so that a wider range of commercial farmers
could be covered. The maximum size of loans (which can be exceeded only
with the approval of the Currency and Credit Council) is 10% of the ADFI's
paid-up capital and reserves; total ADFI equity participation may not exceed
its paid-up capital and reserves and, in any single project, it may not
exceed 15% of the total.
15.       ADFI's lending rate is 8%, inclusive of a supervision fee of
1/2%.  In addition, a commitment fee of 1% is charged on the undisbursed
balance of loans.  A higher rate of 9% is charged when a borrower's earlier
loans are refinanced and also on loans to large agri-business concerns. ADFI
charges 10% on loans for working capital.
Operations
16.       ADFI loan operations have been expanding steadily.  Loans outstanding
rose from Rls 35 million (US$462,000) at the end of 1968/69 to Rls 216 million,
(US$2.9 million) in 1969/70 aii- RIs |'496 million _(US$6.5 million) in 1970/71.  Up
to September 22, 1971, 84 projects had been approved with provision for loans
amounting to Rls 1,661 million (US$22 million). As against this, disbursements
to that date stood at Rls 602 million (US$8.0 million) in respect of 60 pro-
jects. ADFI loans have often been given for combined purposes, particularly
annual crops in conjunction with livestock enterprises, but making an
arbitrary separation of the 84 loans, 39 were for annual crops and orchards,
25 for livestock (dairy and sheep) and 14 for poultry, apart from three units
of agro-industry and three "agribusiness" undertakings. A third of the loans
made is repayable in three to five years, one-half in six to nine years and
the balance, over longer periods. In a few instances the applicants have
changed their decisions to invest or (sometimes) to borrow while, in others,
there have been delays in obtaining clearance from the relevant Ministries in
regard to title to property or other matters or in completing the pre-
liminaries for commencing the project.



ANNEX 7
Page 4
17.        Equity participation by the Fund has been approved so far to the
extent of over Rls 80 million (US$1 million) for four projects, three of
them being concerned with agri-business. Of this, a sum of Rls 43 million
(US$567,000) has been actually contributed.
Recovery of Loans
18.        It is too early to assess ADFI performance on loan recovery as
only a small number of loans (15 including four sub-loans of the Bank loan)
involving a small amount had fallen due for repayment up to the quarter
ended June 20, 1971. Of a sum of Rls 51.1 million (US$670,000) due (in-
cluding Rls 4.2 million (US$55,000) of overdues from the previous quarter),
Rls 44.3 million (US$580,000) was recovered and a sum of Rls 6.9 million
(US$90,000) remained past due at the end of the quarter.
Financial Situation
19.        Appendix 7-3 gives a summary of the ADFI balance sheet as of
June 20, 1969, 1970 and 1971 based on audited accounts and a forecast of
balance sheets as at the end of each of the following four financial years.
Appendix 7-4 gives the corresponding profit and loss accounts. ADFI has not
been able to show a profit during the short period of about three years during
which it has been in active operation as its lending has not expanded at the
rate anticipated while it has had to incur expenses on the professional and
other staff as required. Its losses amounted to Rls 12.5 million (US$165,000)
in each of the years 1968/69 and 1969/70 and Rls 7.5 million (US$100,000) in
1970/71.
20.        ADFI will need additional funds for meeting its share of the
project lending and approximately, it is estimated a sum of Rls 400 million
(US$5.3 million) will need to be provided by government. Government had
earlier indicated its readiness to lend amounts required by ADFI at a rate
of 3-1/2% below ADFI's lending rate, but has not so far provided any loan.
It now appears necessary that the government should provide the Rls 400 million
by way of additional share capital.
21.        The forecasts have been made on the assumption that ADFI will
charge 8% on the majority of its future loans and that additional government
funds of Rls 400 million would be made available as additional share capital.
On this basis, ADFI would make a small profit on a loan portfolio of Rls 2,182
million (US$29 million) in 1973/74, after provision is made for bad debts.
22.        The ADFI Charter stipulates that its net income shall consist
of its revenues less expenditure, deprieciation, and amounts set aside as provision
for doubtful debts in accordance with the auditor's recommendation. Provision
for doubtful debts was made in 1968/69 at 5% of the loan portfolio and in
1969/70 at 2.5%. No addition to the provision was made in 1970/71. Provision
has been made at 3% in the forecasts on the assumption that this rate will be
appropriate in the context of expanded loan operations.



ANNEX 7
Page 5
Accounts and Audit
23.       The accounting and auditing procedures in the ADFI are generally
satisfactory. A government inspector, appointed by the General Assembly
on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, audits ADFI accounts
and certifies such statements. A firm of international public accountants,
Coopers and Lybrand, which assists him, also independently audits and
certifies such statements, besides advising ADFI on accounting matters.
It is possible to obtain separate particulars in regard to ADFI transactions
pertaining to Project loans. Although the basic bookkeeping of ADFI is in
order, there are indications of deficiency in their own management inform-
ation which is reflected in their past failure to meet the reporting re-
quirements under the first Bank loan. Improvement in this respect is
essential as otherwise the problem may grow more serious with the increasing
number and volume of loan transactions.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
ADFI POLICY STATEMENT
A. ADFI's Present Policies
1.        Guidelines on various matters which usually comprise a policy
statement of a financial institution are contained, in the case of the
ADFI, in the Law enacted for the establishment of the Fund, its charter,
and the Monetary and Banking Law of Iran as shown below:
(a) ADFI is an autonomous, corporate body which should operate
on commercial lines and promote private investment in
agriculture and animal husbandry (Article 1 of Law and
Articles 1 and 5 of Charter);
(b) ADFI may finance individuals and private companies for
projects in the fields of crop production, horticulture,
livestock, poultry, fisheries, apiculture as well as
agribusiness and agro-industries (Article 6 of Charter);
(c)  ADFI may (i) finance projects through equity participation
and loans; (ii) promote or subscribe to debentures issued
by private agricultural companies; (iii) guarantee agricul-
tural loans made by other institutions; (iv) provide tech-
nical and financial assistance for agriculture, especially
in regard to project preparation; and (v) undertake and
manage investments in agricultural projects as agency of
Government and local and foreign institutions and banks
(Article 5 of Charter);
(d) ADRI is restricted in its (i) equity participation in the
aggregate to its paid up capital and reserves and, in any
single company, to 15 % of such (ADFI's) capital and
reserves; and (ii) loan to a single borrower to 10% of its
paid up capital and reserves, which limit could, however,
be exceeded with the approval of the Currency and Credit
Council (Article 4 of Law and Section 3, Article 65 of
Monetary and Banking Law);
(e) ADFI may accept, as security for its loans, land, water
resources, installation and equipment relating to the
project being financed (Article 6 of Law); and

(f)  of ADFI's net income consisting of its revenue less
expenditure, depreciation aLnd amounts set aside as
provision for doubtful debts in accordance with auditors'
recommendatioris, 20% shall be appropriated to reserves.
Of the rest, a part shall be carried forward to next
year's accounl: and the balance added to the Fund's capital.
B. Additional Policy Matters
2.        By and large, the policies and procedures adopted by the Fund on
the lines set out in the various documents have been satisfactory.  However,
it was found that somle matters of interest to the Bank were not referred to
in either the law or the charter, though some of them were covered satis-
factorily by the loan regulations and equity regulations adopted by ADFI's
High Council. Therefore, agreement was reached on a number of amendments to
these regulations to cover additional matters. It was agreed that implement-
ation of these amendments by ADFI's High Council would be a condition of
loan effectiveness. Further, during negotiations assurance was obtained that
no changes would be made to either the Loan or Equity Regulations without
the prior approval of the Bank. The amendments are summarized as follows:
(a)  The period of repaymLent of a loan should be related to
the anticipated economic life of the asset which is
being financed and a careful assessment of the repaying
capacity of the enterDrise;
(b) The Fund will not normally re-finance an investment which
has been undertaken by the borrower prior to the date of
the loan or provide funds for the repayment of earlier
loans except where this is nrecessary for the purpose of
securing collateral necessary for its loan or when earlier
borrowings are on inappropriately short-terms taking into
account the life of the assets financed thereby and the
cash position of the borrower;
(c) the Fund would assist its borrowers in obtaining working
capital funds from commercial banks.  Where such arrange-
ments cannot be made, the Fund may provide working capital
to its borrowers for a limited period. Working capital loans
should, in all such cases, be kept distinct from medium-
and long-term loans for fixed capital needs and be based
on suitable norms of current outlay per hectare on inputs
and labor, determined speciiically for each crop; and
(d) the Fund will try to revolve its equity portfolio to the
extent practicable.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        The rates of return from the Project to the economy have been
calculated separately for each farm model as shown in the attached table.
The following assumptions have been made:
(a)  World market prices as projected by the Trade Policies and
Export Projections Division of IBRD's Economic Department
have been used to estimate lbenefits for all products,
except alfalfa and milk, which are regarded as "non-tradeable"
commodities; in their case, the current Iranian prices have
been applied;
(b)  Current price levels have been used for investments with
no allowance for cost increiases;
(c)  Deductions have been made in respect of taxes on investment
goods (5% on imported components: 20% in the case of pumps
and motors) and on imported fertilizers;
(d) Salvage values proportional to unexpired asset life
have been included where appropriate;
(e)  Labor has been costed at the general prevailing rate
of Rls 100 per day.
2.        When weighted according to the relative share of each model
in project costs, the average economic rate of return is 19%.
