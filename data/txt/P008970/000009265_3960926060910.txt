MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR A CUKUROVA URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
}.       The following report on a proposed loan to the Republic of Turkey of
US$120 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would carry a
standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 17 years including 4 years
of grace and would help finance an urban development project.
2.       Background.  Half of Turkey's population of over 52 million now lives
in cities and towns, and the number of urban dwellers is growing at around 4.5
percent per year. Urban areas produce about three quarters of GNP and are the
country's main hope of providing employment and incomes to a rapidly increasing
work force. Turkey's cities suffer from inadequate urban infrastructure which
constrains economic growth and imposes heavy social costs. In the past, urban
infrastructure investments have been limited and policies determining design
standards, pricing, and cost recovery have not been adequate. Imbalances have
resulted from the division of re.,ponsibilities between Central Government
agencies, which have undertaken most of the infrastructure investments, and
local authorities, which have been responsible primarily for operation and
maintenance. Heavy overprogramming and poor coordination among these agencies
have only aggravated the problem of adequate infrastructure provision. In its
recent policy reforms, the Government of Turkey has taken several initiatives
to meet the urban service delivery challenge. It has decentralized responsibi-
lities for key municipal services to local governments and stepped up the
resource flows to municipalities.
3.       Project Objectives.  The proposed project 'would help the Government
to refine and implement its decentralization strategy through selective
interventions in five major cities -- Adana, Mersin, Tarsus, Ceyhan,
Iskenderun -- in the Cukurova region of southern Turkey. The Cukurova region
was selected for the project because it exemplifies the problems of rapid
urban growth and service deficiencies, and because future growth in this
important area will be jeopardized if services are not provided more
efficiently. The project would assist the five municipalities in directing
urban growth and catching up on service deficiencies through financing
infrastructure investments. It would also strengthen their ability to plan,
implement, operate, and maintain these services, while improving their
resource mobilization and financial management.  In parallel, the proposed
project would take a first step towards reorienting Iller Bank by establishing
in it a capability to appraise and supervise municipal investment programs.



- 2 -
4.       Project Description.  The proposed project would finance part of
the 1987-94 segment of the five municipalities' investment programs. The
Iller Bank would establish a Project Review, Implementation, and Monitoring
Unit (PRIMU) to review the investment programs on an annual basis, assess the
municipalities' continiued creditworthiness, appraise subprojects submitted for
Iller Bank funding, and monitor implementation. The main components to be
supported would include: (a) area-based infrastructure programs which would
service unbuilt land with social facilities and infrastructure suitable for
residential use in urban expansion areas (UEAs); guide and regularize
spontaneous private development on the urban periphery; and provide
infrastructure and social facilities there and in the gecekondu (unplanned
informal housing) areas. Those components would serve some 176,000 households
(880,000 people). UEAs would be developed by Housing and Urban Development
Companies (HUDCs) owned by the municipalities. They would aim to recover all
costs through the sale of developed land and to generate profits for
reinvestment in similar activities. Cost recovery in the other areas would be
achieved through fees for planning regularization, betterment levies, and
connection charges; (b) citywide infrastructure development programs, which
would help overcome deficiencies in the main networks for water, sanitation,
drainage, roads, and solid waste management, and link with the area-based
programs; and (c) an institutional development program, which would support a
restructuring of the municipalities and strengthen their ability to plan and
implement investment programs, to operate and maintain existing facilities,
and to manage their finances. The institutional strengthening, which started
during project preparation, includes: creation of semi-autonomous municipal
water and sanitation departments (WSDs); creation of departments to handle
housing management and gecekondu upgrading programs, solid waste management,
roads and drainage, and training and manpower development; establishment of
planning, programming, and budgeting units; and strengthening of the
municipalities' finance departments.  The project would also support PRIMU, a
regional training center for municipal staff, as well as technical assistance
for Iller Ba.ak, and computerization of its accounts. The project would
provide funds for civil works, equipment, and professional services for
design, supervision, and technical assistance. The total cost of the project
is estimated at US$467.4 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US$137.6 million equivalent (29 percent).  A breakdown of the costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Bank funds would be onlent by the
Government to Iller Bank and by Iller Bank to municipalities. Ultimate
borrowers would bear the foreign exchange and interest risks. About
US$l million would be passed by Government to the Regional Training Institute
on a grant basis. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank group operations in Turkey are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report (Number 6657-TU) dated April 17, 1987 is being distributed separately.
5.       Rationale for Bank involvement.  The project is an integral part of
the sector development strategy of supporting Government's decentralization
policy and would help in building up the capabilities of municipalities and
their subsidiary organizations to manage municipal services efficiently and
economically. The project closely follows the Cukurova Region Urban
Engineering Loan (2537-TU), which financed its preparation and helped develop
proposals for municipal reforms. Reforms which have already been implemented
are the modification of laws to simplify regularization of land tenure and



- 3 -
planning status and to increase levels of cost recovery. Other reforms which
would strengthen municipal organization, modernize financial management, and
develop municipal staff, are to be introduced under the project.
6.       Agreed Actions.  Agreement was secured at negotiations: (a) that
ratification of the Loan Agreement and Project Agreements, and conclusion of
the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between Government and Iller Bank, and Municipal
Financing Agreements between Iller Bank and the project municipalities would
be completed as a condition of effectiveness; (b) that financial regulations
would be changed by September 30, 1987 to require the project municipalities
to introduce the proposed accounting improvements; (c) that recruitment of the
principal PRIMU staff including its principal TA staff would be completed by
September 30, 1987; (d) that PRIMU would allocate resources and appraise
projects according to procedures and criteria agreed with the Bank; (e) that
municipalities would appoint consultants for design and supervision to assist
with implementation; (f) that municipalities would take measures for cost
recovery on area-based investments and WSD operations; (g) that municipalities
would formally approve policy statements governing the operations, financing,
and cost recovery policies of their HUDCs; and (h) that Goverument would cause
finances to be made available for implementation of the social facilities and
electricity and telephone components of the area-based infrastructure programs.
7.       Justification.  The project would help refine and implement the
Government's decentralization policy. It would support in Iller Bank the
building of capacity to appraise and supervise municipal investment programs.
The project would demonstrate a strategy which promises to enable Turkey to
handle its urban growth problems in a more cost-effective manner without large
net additions to investments allocated for this purpose. Thus, the project
municipalities are forecast to draw a smaller share of Iller Bank and Central
Government resources earmarked for municipal investments than would be
warranted by their share in the urban population. The package is believed to
be of sufficient scale and importance to make a substantial impact on urban
growth, to retain the close interest of the concerned authorities, and to
provide lessons which are representative enough to be applied generally in
Turkish municipalities. Benefits of the specific project components would
include higher land and rental values in area-based infrastructure programs,
improved water and sanitation services, higher land values from drainage and
road works, cost savings and increased safety to road users, and environmental
and health benefits from improved sanitation, solid waste management, and
drainage. More than half of project expenditures would be on components which
benefit families with incomes below the urban poverty level. The ERR on
components accounting for 53 percent of costs and for which benefits could be
quantified would be 30 percent.
8.       Risks.  (a) Adverse changes in incomes and/or interest rates might
threaten the financial viability of project entities.  The financial policies
to be implemented under the project, together with the conservative nature of
the basic financial forecasts, provide some assurance that the project
entities will be able to weather considerable "macroeconomic" adversity
without adverse effect on the investment program. Moreover, the strengthened
programming, planning, and budgeting capabilities in the municipalities, and
the institution of PRIMU in the Iller Bank, should enable the municipalities,
Iller Bank, and Government to respond flexibly to changed circumstances. (b)
The risk that Iller Bank would be unable to retain staff of the caliber needed



-4-
to manage PRIMU has bten minimized by having the PRIMU director appointed
before negotiations, and also by providing finances to staff PRIMU with
specialist personnel on contract terms so as not to be limited by public
sector payscales. (c) There is some risk that the cost recovery objectives
might not be pursued forcefully. Although political pressures may cause some
unevenness in cost recovery performance, the continuous monitoring of
municipal greditworthiness and municipal performance by PRIMU would provide a
safeguard. In the longer term, project success would depend upon continued
Government support for the decentralization strategy: reversal of that policy
would signal the need for a thorough review, and possibly a restructuring of
the project.
9.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
