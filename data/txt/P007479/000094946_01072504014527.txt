3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The Reform of Secondary Education Project (ROSE) aims: (a) to implement the first phase of the
ROSE Program in order to improve the quality and equity of Grades 7 through 9, with emphasis on schools



serving the poorest students; (b) to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Culture
(MOEYC) to plan and monitor the impact of the ROSE Program; and (c) to improve the quality and cost
effectiveness of public provision of social services.
The key objectives of the project are to:
(i)  introduce a major reform of the junior secondary education system (i.e. Grades 7-9) with a
focus on the poorest groups within these grades;
(ii) strengthen the MOEYC's capacity to manage and evaluate the impact of such a reform; and
(iii) strengthen the Planning Institute of Jamaica's (PIOJ) capacity to carry out relevant and
timely social policy analysis (in order to formulate more effective social programs in targeted
areas).
It is important to note that the first two of these objectives pertained to ROSE, which was financed
by the World Bank loan, with counterpart funding from the Government of Jamaica (GOJ). ROSE was
implemented by the MOEYC. The last objective referred to the Social Policy Analysis component (SPA),
which was funded by a grant from the Government of the Netherlands, with counterpart funding from GOJ.
The Bank was the administrator of the Dutch Grant on behalf of the Minister for Development Cooperation
of the Netherlands. SPA was implemented by the PIOJ. Although SPA was viewed administratively as one
sub-component of the ROSE project, in goals, implementing agencies and financing, it operated as a
freestanding project. This report made separate references to ROSE and SPA.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The development objectives of ROSE can be considered to have been achieved. The foundation for
the reform has been laid for it to be deepened at the school level in future. This will be taken up by the
follow-on project, ROSE II.
The development objectives of SPA can also be considered to have been achieved. The project has
helped to build the policy analysis capacity, raise the level of debate around poverty and other social issues,
and increase the empahsis on data driven policy analysis.
(a)    Improve quality and equity of lower secondary education
Access to secondary education. The annual Jamaican Survey of Living Conditions (JSLC)
undertaken by PIOJ in 1999 confirmed that access to schooling among students between the ages of 12 and
14 was approaching universal (Figure 1). Since this is the main age-group for junior secondary education,
beneficiaries of ROSE encompass the entire junior secondary education population. However, access to
upper secondary education and tertiary education still reflects the socioeconomic divide of the society, as
enrollment among students from the poorest quintile declined sharply after age 14. Extending access to
upper secondary education will depend on improved quality of lower secondary education, expanded supply
of school places and increased demand for schooling among the adolescents. These challenges will be taken
up by the next phase of ROSE.

Targeting and equity. The project has targeted disadvantaged schools (All-Age Schools in rural
areas and New Secondary Schools in urban areas) for special assistance, by providing new and unified
curricula in core subjects, by promoting activity-based teaching and cooperative learning, and by supplying
curriculum guides, teachers guides, textbooks, and infrastructure upgrading. These approaches and inputs
are valued and sought after even by teachers and students of academic-oriented Traditional High Schools.
During the life of the project, targeted All-age schools were upgraded to Primary and Junior High schools
(P&JH), while New Secondary schools were eliminated as a category and upgraded to Comprehensive
Highs in September, 1999.

A greater proportion of poor students are attending better secondary schools at the end of the
project than at the beginning. Table 1 shows that the percentage of students from lower consumption
quintiles attending All-Age schools has been reduced between 1993 and 1999. Although this reduction is
largely due to upgrading of All-Age schools to Primary and Junior High schools, the combined enrollment
of students from the poorer quintiles in these two school types in 1999 w-as still lower than that in 1993.
The increase in enrollment among students from the lower quintiles in Comprehensive Highs was also due
to an expansion of these types of schools. However, the increase in enrollment of students from the bottom
three quintiles in the academic, Traditional High Schools could most likely be attributable to increased
access for under-privileged students to better schools. This trend identified by the JSLC is corroborated
by the placement records from Grade 9 to Grade 10 of the Student Assessment Unit and the Evaluation
Unit.

Source: Data for 1993 were taken from Reform of Secondary Education Project Staff Appraisal

Conditions 1999, Table E-4.
Less clear in terms of accomplishments are school attendance, internal efficiency (repetition and
retention), extemal efficiency (labor market outcomes), and academic achievement. Although the project
did not state improving these indicators as its objectives, it aimed at improving achievement as a key
outcome measure. Since higher attendance and better efficiency directly impact on achievement, these
indicators should be considered as well.
School attendance (or absenteeism) has remained a problem. In 1999-2000, the average daily
attendance in Grades 7-9 was 68 percent in All-Age Schools, 73 percent in P&JH, and 72 percent in ROSE
Project schools (MOEYC statistics).

According to the JSLC of 1998, 60 percent of students were absent between 2-5 days in a
one-month period, while 19 percent were absent between 6-10 days and 7 percent for 10-20 day (Table 2a).
Absenteeism varied among Parishes. Nearly 40 percent of the students in Portland, Trelawny and St. James
did not attend schools for more than 5 days of the 20 day reference period.
The reasons for non-attendance varied among consumption quintiles (Table 2b).  "Money
problems" were cited as the main reason by 62 to 70 percent of students in the lowest two quintiles. For
the top quintile, illness was cited as the main reason for missing school. The JSLC's data on household
expenditure on education confirms that poor households bear a heavier burden on education of their
children than richer households. However, the JSLC questionnaire did not pinpoint more precisely in what
way money problems had affected students adversely, for example, whether it was the lack of money for
lunch and snacks or for extra tutoring needed to pass examination. The JSLC also did not contain questions
on whether non-attendance is due to students' falling too behind to be bothered with school, or being
discouraged by the lack of employment prospects. To facilitate policy intervention, it would be helpful if
future surveys include questions to disentangle whether non-attendance is due to demand side (academic
failure, social or physiological reasons such as pregnancy) or supply side (availability of places in Grades
10 to 11 for students to continue) problems.

Internal efficiency. The school system in Jamaica traditionally has low repetition rates, largely due
to the practice of moving students through the system in order to make space for incoming cohorts. This
practice is changing with the implementation of the national assessment program and the institution of
testing for achievement at Grade 4 to determine whether students should repeat. The new policy was
introduced towards the end of the project and hence, does not affect the repetition rates of lower secondary
education. However, the fact that students from lower quintiles tend not to remain in school points to
retention as a serious issue in secondary education. At-risk-youths stand out as the most serious challenge
to secondary education.
External efficiency. Economic stagnation reduces the employment prospects of graduates from
secondary schools. While improving the employment prospects does not rest on the education sector alone,
a more skilled and flexible labor force capable of adapting to changing world market and technological
conditions could mitigate the adverse effects of the economic downtum. The fact that reading below grade
level even at the end of junior secondary education has remained widespread does not help young people
break the cycle of poverty. (See the percentage correct in Mathematics and Language Arts JHSC
Examination in Table 3 for a quantitative indication of the level of mastery of cognitive skills).
Academic achievement. Formative evaluation studies were undertaken by MOEYC to compare
students from ROSE and non-ROSE schools by a number of criteria. These studies found discernible
differences the project has made in terms of improving student self-image, better test scores, better
opportunity for placement, and higher success rates in the next level of education. However, the samples of
these formative evaluation studies were relatively small, and the reliability and validity of the instruments
and the vigor of the analysis had yet to be established.
To establish a trend line of student achievement, test scores of the Junior High School Certificate
(JHSC) Examination at the end of Grade 9 from 1995 to 2000 were used. (See Table 3). Since all ROSE
students participated in this examination, the JHSC data captured the entire ROSE student population.
Moreover, the validity and reliability of the JHSC examination had been well established; hence, it is a
good measure of achievement.
The statistics on the total number of schools and Grade 9 students in secondary education in
Jamaica and the number of schools and Grade 9 students participating in the JHSC examination are
indicative of the participation rates in the JHSC examination (Table 3). The percentage correct statistics
provide an approximation of the extent to which students master the curriculum. Nonetheless, percentage
correct does not reflect whether the level of difficulty in the test was comparable from year to year. To
measure progress over time, the mean raw scores (not the percent correct) and the standard deviations have
to be equated with those of a single year. Since the 1995 and 1996 tests were still at the pilot stage, these
scores were not equated. The test of 1998 was used for calibration with those in 1997, 1999, and 2000.
The positive points revealed by the trend are as follows:
* In countries that have introduced reform, as in Jamaica, student performance does not change
overnight when a school begins implementing innovations. As the reform scales up and as new
schools participate in the program and the end-of-cycle examination process, their inclusion is
likely to affect the average student performance. Similarly, as the number of students
participating in a test increases, the range of test scores tend to widen and the average scores
tend to decrease. In the JHSC examination, however, the percentage correct had not declined,
in spite of the overall 69 percent increase in the number of students taking the test between
-6 -



1997 and 2000. In fact, P&JH made small but noticeable gains in percentage correct in
Mathematics, albeit an increase in participation by 84 percent during the same period.
* The equated scores confirmed that the decline in percentage correct in 1999 was due to the
increasing difficulty of the tests rather than poorer performance of the candidates. The stability
of the equated scores over time, when taken into account the increase in participation rates,
essentially conveys a positive message.
Nonetheless, the data also revealed a number of weaknesses:
*   The difference in achievement was large across and within different school types. Large
standard deviation within each school type indicated high variability in leaming outcomes.
Reducing the variability in achievement has remained a major challenge to education.
*   The low percentage correct in Mathematics and Language Arts suggests that on average,
students have not fully mastered the most basic of cognitive skills. Even in Traditional High
Schools, which are the most academically oriented, complete mastery by all students has yet to
be achieved.
*   Students were much weaker in Mathematics than in Language Arts. Given that reading literacy
has persistently been a serious issue even in secondary education, the weakness in mathematics
must be considered as equally serious as a challenge to education, as it has implications for
building the capacity for science and technology in the country.
The key question for the project is: Has ROSE inputs made any difference in student
performance if prior learning was controlled for? The loan agreement stipulated that the single output
indicator to judge the success of the reform should be a difference of at least 25 percent between the
pre-test and post-test scores within the classroom and positive and statistically significant post-test scores
for Project schools in relation to comparison schools. However, in light of the lack of synchronization of
delivery of ROSE inputs, the countrywide expansion of the ROSE project (leaving virtually no schools
untouched by the ROSE project) and the upgrading in quality of available national examinations (coupled
with the absence of validated classroom "pre-tests" and "post-tests"), the method proposed in the loan
agreement was judged to be inappropriate to evaluate the impact of ROSE. Instead, another methodology
was used in a study undertaken by the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicates (UCLES)
of the United Kingdom (Bramley, 2000).
This method used the scores of JHSC examination in Mathematics and Language Arts at the end of
Grade 9 as the outcome measure and the test scores of this cohort which took the Grade Six Achievement
Test (GSAT) three years ago to control for their prior achievement, in order to assess the effects of factors
associated with ROSE implementation. The sample comprised several thousand students who took the
1996 GSAT in 1996 and the JHSC in 1999. The analysis used the hierarchical linear modeling to examine
whether teacher in-service training and teacher attitude (which were some of the key ROSE interventions)
made a difference on learning outcomes in Mathematics and Language Arts. Data on infrastructure,
textbook availability, and principals attitude were collected but were not used because delivery of these
inputs was not synchronized with teacher training and the record was incomplete.
The analysis concluded that once prior achievement was controlled for, teacher training and
teacher attitude had no statistically significant impact on student performance. This finding did not
- 7 -



invalidate the ROSE curriculum or methodology, particularly given the lack of synchronization of delivery
of other ROSE inputs such as textbooks and civil works, and the movement of teachers to other schools or
other grades after training. However, the fndings did raise serious questions on (a) how to improve the
effectiveness of in-service training; (b) whether there should be more emphasis on subject matter content;
and (c) whether the training should be school-based to enable addressing specific issues in the classroom
and of the students, thus ensuring that the reform take root in the school.
In conclusion, these analyses showed that raising the overall academic achievement and reducing
the variability of learning outcomes remain the most important challenge for ROSE II.

(b)   Capacity Strengthening in Management and Evaluation
The Project has adopted  a management structure by  forgoing  the Project Implementation Unit
approach used in earlier projects and by fully integrating the project activities with regular ministry
activities to ensure ownership and sustainability.  ROSE  is guided by a Reform  Management Committee
- 9 -



(RMC), chaired by the Permanent Secretary, with the ROSE National Coordinator as the deputy, and with
participation of 5 divisional directors, 1 regional director, 10 officers from various units, 6 members of the
project secretariat, and one representative from the Joint Board of Teacher Education (JBTE). The RMC
collectively planned, implemented, and monitored the reform. The reform has become an integral part of
daily education activities.
On the implementation front, valuable lessons have been learned with respect to project record
keeping and accounting, contract writing and procurement. Future operations should pay close attention to
these practices and to improve on forward planning, financial projection, and information flow within the
Secretariat and with the rest of the Ministry.
The Student Assessment Unit has vastly improved its capacity to develop and administer the Junior
High School Certificate Examination (JHSC). This examination has performed both placement and
certification purposes and can be used, in combination of the Grade Six Achievement Test, to monitor
student learning outcomes.
The Evaluation Unit has also generated a lot of studies to monitor the impact of the ROSE Project.
However, the unit is seriously under staffed for the kind of work it does (which is not limited to the ROSE
Project). Hence, there is a trade off between quantity and quality because of the constraints of time,
resources and technical skills. How better to manage evaluation and integrate it with student assessment
poses a challenge for the follow up operation.
(c)    Capacity Strengthening in Social Policy Analysis
The objectives of building sound analytic capacity in the social sectors were important to the
poverty reduction agenda of the country, which is, in tum, key in the country assistance strategy. The
objectives remained valid through the life of the project and have achieved to a considerable extent. The
project design called for interventions in four parts of the nascent policy analysis network:
(i) The project was to establish a Social Policy Analysis Unit in the PIOJ to build institutional
linkages, disseminate information, coordinate training, carry out in-house analysis and contract additional
research under a pipeline of funds dedicated to the purpose.
(ii) the line ministries of Health, of Education, and of Labor, Welfare and Sport were to
participate in the definition of a program of social policy research, benefit from policy maker and staff
seminars to upgrade their respective policy analysis skills and the Ministry of Labor, Social Security and
Sports was also to benefit from a small amount of computer equipment and technical assistance.
(iii) at the University of the West Indies, faculty-upgrading courses (also open to senior staff
from the line ministries) were to be offered in policy analysis methods, curriculum were to be upgraded in
similar graduate courses to be taught permanently, fellowships in policy analysis were to be offered, and a
program of social policy research was to be elaborated jointly between government and the university and
carried out largely by the university, and a data bank was to be established at the Institute for Social and
Economic Research (ISER) which was renamed during the life of the project and is now called the Sir
Arthur Lewis Institute of Social and Economic Studies (SALISES).
(iv) support for the Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) to conduct annual Jamaica Survey
of Living Conditions (JSLC) was to be provided.
- 10-



The most notable achievements are the institutionalizing of the annual JSLC as the basis of social
monitoring and poverty assessment in the country; improvements in the quality and timeliness of analysis of
the JSLC; institutionalization of a social policy analysis unit, the PDU in the PIOJ; and establishment of a
data bank at the University of the West Indies (UWI). Training in quantitative analysis has strengthened
the quality of teaching in the UWI and also built the capacity of analysts in a number of line ministries.
The research agenda fully utilized the pool of research talent of the country and reinforced the capacity
built by training.
The implementation working paper contains many more monitoring indicators than those used in
the staff appraisal report. Quarterly progress reports were done regularly and usually reported activities
that underlay these indicators. But in most cases there were no explicit targets set in the implementation
working paper, and thus no explicit judgment contained in the monitoring as to whether the progress was
sufficient or not.
Most elements of the project led to moderate improvements in either the quantity or the quality of
policy analysis, however, most improvements fell somewhat short of the generally poorly specified
standards hoped for at the time of project design. Whether the failure is in the realism of expectation or the
performance of the project is not wholly clear. It is probably a mixture of both.
The project has helped to raise the level of debate around poverty and other social issues and has
improved the quality of social analysis across the social sectors. The project has also helped to increase the
emphasis on data driven policy analysis. Discussions of poverty in Jamaica now rely on data from the
JSLC. For example, a working group, comprised of the Cabinet Secretariat, line ministries and the PIOJ
was established to look at the implications of the JSLC and to develop a set of policy recommendations
based on the findings so that these could inform policy decisions. In addition, the findings of the JSLC are
presented at Cabinet retreats.
The elements meant to involve the three line ministries were too small have a large impact on them,
though the ministries report that what was delivered was generally useful. Ministry staff that participated
in the advanced upgrading courses are, for the most part, still working in their respective ministries. The
Ministry of Education would probably benefit most from the training and the Ministry of Health from the
research agenda. The Ministry of Labor, Welfare and Sport found the small amount equipment purchased
for them to be their biggest benefit from the project. One indication of the benefits of the project can be
inferred from the fact that a significant number of line ministry staff who participated in the senior level
training program and still working in their ministries and have expressed interest in taking a more advanced
series of courses.
The project has helped to raise the standard of teaching and research at the University by raising
expectations regarding access to data, the level of analysis and the need for policy relevance of research. It
made data more available for research and teaching. Data analysis and research is now a more important
element in teaching both at the graduate and undergraduate levels. The project also had the important
though general and dispersed impact of improving the training of a couple of cohorts of graduate students.
These impacts are hard to quantify and even harder to separate from a general trend due to improved
computerization through the university and government. Nonetheless it is clear that project supported
courses, the time series data provided by the Survey of Living Conditions and the Data Bank have been key
catalysts for this trend.
One goal of the project was to facilitate a network of analysts, so that if there was not a critical
mass in any one place, at least across the network there would be enough support to provide encouragement
- 11 -



and troubleshooting for problems encountered doing analytic work.  The ministries were not very
successfully integrated into this network, possibly because their involvement was relatively small. This in
turn means that the general network and its most direct links into policymaking did not gel as intended.
However, the project has helped to foster greater interaction between academic staff at the UWI and the
PIOJ and sector ministries. The involvement and cooperation between PIOJ, STATIN and UWI was
full-fledged and successful. This was facilitated by the SPA Coordinating Committee and now continues
through the on-going SLC Steering Committee. In general, the policy analysis network as a whole
benefited from the linkages of these institutions.
One objective of the project was to ensure that data from a variety of sources, including
operational data from the ministries, financial data and economic data, be integrated into research. This
has not happened. In addition, the project may have inadvertently created an artificial divide between
social and economic analysis.
4.2 Outputs by components:
ROSE: Implementation was satisfactory overall. However, about 10 percent of the US$32 million loan
could not be disbursed mainly due to non-completion of all civil works contracts by some contractors,
non-implementation of technical assistance in reading, and partial delivery of furniture.
Component 1: Secondary Reform Support:
The ROSE Project has exceeded many of the physical targets, although it lagged behind in civil
works and did not implement reading improvement. Annex 1 provides a synopsis of the extent to which
physical targets have been achieved.  The following paragraphs take account of  the process of
implementation.
(a)    A Common Curriculum for Grades 7 to 9
Coverage. The project supported the introduction of a common core curriculum (Language arts,
mathematics, science, social studies and resource and technology and career education) which is
learner-centered, which emphasizes cooperative learning, and which combines a basic skills focus with
problem solving activities. The target was to implement this curriculum in 72 All-Age and New Secondary
schools, encompassing 28,000 students. These physical targets have been exceeded.
Starting with 11 pilot schools in 1991 before the project began, 32 came on board in 1993, 28 in
1994, 36 in 1995, and 22 in 1996, totaling 129 schools shortly after the mid-term of the project. Among the
schools that participated in the national ROSE Program, 90 All-Age schools were upgraded to Primary and
Junior High schools (P&JH) and 75 New Secondary schools were upgraded to Comprehensive schools. In
1999, all secondary and comprehensive high schools nationwide were mandated to teach the ROSE
curriculum, benefiting a total of 226 schools nationwide and approximately 118,300 students in Grades 7
- 9. The remaining 356 All-Age Schools (with 24,000 students because they were small schools) were
provided the curriculum and sensitization training in January, 2000, although textbooks have yet to be
provided to all the schools. Curriculum and teachers' guides for six additional subjects - Physical
Education, Religious Education, Music, Drama, Spanish and Visual Arts have been piloted, revised,
printed and distributed.
Supporting materials, local consultants' services and positions. To facilitate the teaching of the
- 12 -



ROSE curriculum, teachers' guides and manuals, and handbooks for school administrators were produced.
Local consultants were contracted to develop continuous daily assessment, to conduct curriculum research
to support curriculum revision, and to develop remaining additional subject areas. Incremental positions for
more teachers and guidance counselors were created. Technical assistance from overseas on continuous
assessment was also contracted. The physical targets were met.
(b)    Pre-service and in-service training of teachers and school administrators
To assure implementation of the new curriculum, in-service training of teachers, school
administrators and regional education officers were undertaken. The target was to train 6,800 teachers, 60
education officers, 550 administrators, 2,200 school board members, 380 teachers trainers, and 2,500
teacher trainees. The JBTE was responsible for providing in-service training through summer workshops,
school visits and development of distance education materials. The MOEC was responsible for training and
orientation activities of education officers, school administrators, school board members, teacher trainers at
tertiary education and students in teachers colleges. By the end of the JBTE contract, 5,014 teachers were
trained in ROSE methodology and an additional 2,688 attended workshops. In addition, 60 regional
education officers, 90 regional office staff, over 600 administrators, nearly 1,500 school board members,
40 teachers of independent schools, 380 teacher trainers, and 2,000 pre-service trainees were trained.
The JBTE certifies pre-service teacher education programs in Jamaica. Putting it in charge of the
in-service training program ensured the linkage between in-service and pre-service training through the
adoption of ROSE methodology by teachers colleges in their pre-service teacher education programs. This
provided consistency in the approach to teaching and learning. The JBTE regional training teams are based
in the TCs and, besides running workshops, provided assistance to teachers and principals through school
visits. Their regular interaction with teaching staff and students in teachers' colleges has facilitated
integration of pre-service and in-service training. ROSE in-service trainers were eventually absorbed into
TCs, thereby allowing for institutionalization.
However, implementation of in-service training was not entirely smooth. First of all, the number of
teachers who were willing to forego their summer vacation to attend workshops fell short of the target. The
JBTE had to adjust its training program to winter, thereby cutting short the duration. Second, teachers who
were trained did not always assign to teach Grades 7 to 9, therefore, their impact was not maximized.
Third, training emphasized methodology without simultaneously addressing the needs for strengthening
subject matter knowledge. The evaluation findings of no statistically significant positive impact of teacher
training and attitude on student achievement once prior learning was controlled for also raised the questions
as to whether more effective training should be school-based and what other measures needed to be
implemented simultaneously in order to achieve the desired outcomes.
Finally, the development of distance learning materials was not smooth. The contract was
extended twice before all the modules were delivered by 2000. Therefore, there is a gap in continuous
training which the modules are designed for after the end of the workshops. Furthermore, the quality and
relevance of the modules have yet to be tested through implementation.
(c)    Production and distribution of instructional materials
The Foundation books that were developed under the DFID (formerly ODA) financed Secondary
School Textbook Project (SSTP) are of high quality. The distribution of foundation textbooks of
Mathematics, Language Arts, Science and Social Studies for Grade 7 began in 1995 (Table 4). The
delivery of the foundation books for Grade 8 began in the following years, but the entire series for all 4
- 13 -



subjects was available only in 1998. Of all subjects, only social studies foundation books were delivered in
consecutive years to enable students who went through three years of junior secondary education from
1995 to 1998 to have access to books. Although the targets have been met by 1999, the interruption in
delivery made it difficult to fully evaluate the impact of ROSE on student learning at the end of the project.
It should also be noted that foundation books have never been planned for Resource and Technology. This
has remained a concem among teachers and students.
On the issue of textbook rental, while the scheme has been up and running, the take-up rates are
only about 50 percent of the foundation books of core subjects. Parents who are not concemed with their
children's study did not give them money for renting the books, nor did they apply for assistance which is
available. Where books are available, teachers do not necessarily know how to make the best use of them in
teaching. Given the reluctance of some parents to rent books for their children, changes must be made in
the immediate future to ensure that each child has a foundation book in the core subjects. The options
included reducing rental fees, giving foundation books to children for free while maintaining rental for
normative and enrichment books, and asking parents for a deposit at the beginning of the school year and
returning the deposit when the books are returned at the end of the year.

(d)    Provision of educational support materials
Forty-eight (48) Primary and Junior High Project schools have been provided with basic
educational support materials and equipment to support the core subjects. However, there are some
schools that have not yet received all materials and equipment allotted to them due to a space problem
which is as a result of the delays being experienced in the civil works program. Thirty-seven
Comprehensive High schools were provided with J$8.4m to assist in purchasing basic educational support
materials and equipment.
(e)    Infrastructure improvement for schools adopting the common curriculum
Civil works. The target was to support (i) construction of 3 new JHS; (ii) refurbishing and
extension of 27 All-Age schools; (iii) refurbishing of 10 New Secondary schools and 20 rural All-Age
schools.
The civil works program was changed during the life of the project. In 1997, the loan agreement
was amended to construct only one new school because of a serious cost under-estimation at the time of
project preparation and cost escalation due to delays. The unallocated amount of $2.6 million was
reallocated to civil works, making the total allocation for civil works to be $14.6 million. Expenditure on
- 14 -



civil works funded by the Bank reached $16.98 million by April 30, 2001. Due to cancellation of
non-performing contracts and re-starting of new ones, an estimated $2 million are needed to finish the
program.
Construction of the only new school was close to 100 percent complete. Of the 27 schools targeted
for refurbishment and extension, a decision was taken to reduce the number to 25 only. Six of the
remaining 8 schools are at various stages of completion. Of the 30 schools for refurbished only, a decision
was taken to refurbished only 27, and the works were completed.
There are a number of strengths in the Ministry's management of the civil works program,
including the reporting and monitoring system which goes to PIOJ, PAMCO and the Bank; timely honoring
of payment certificates to contractors; improved transparency in the contracting processes; and allocation
of work amongst consultants through zoning to manageable amounts.
The slowness in implementing this sub-component is due to many reasons. First, the schedule of
the civil works component was unrealistic, without giving sufficient lead time for pre-contract activities.
Second, during the first three years of the life of the project, a building officer with dedicated responsibility
to ROSE alone was not appointed. Third, the Bank introduced new procurement documents. Most of the
procurement and construction activities were undertaken in the last four years of the project. Fourth, the
financial crisis impacted many contractors adversely. Non-performance of contractors had led to the
termination of 17 percent of the contracts.
Less than satisfactory quality and high cost were the other major issues of civil works. The
reasons for the high costs included: (i) insufficient intemal control of design at the early stage, resulting in
correction of architectural design.; (ii) consulting firms contract being based on 14 percent of the contract
sum of the contractor, which could provide some basis for cost escalation and lax supervision; (iii) the low
provision for an advance payment of 10 percent in the contractor's contract which did not provide for
sufficient capital for starting the work; and (iv) exchange rate differences.
The recommendations for the future are as follows:
(i)  Use a more stringent selection process of contractors (strengthen evaluation teams) and
raising the advance payment of future contracts to 20 percent of the contract amount;
(ii) hold pre-tender site meetings with bidders: to give more realistic time estimates for works and
to require bidders to provide method statement and work plan;
(iii) introduce additional intemal control at the design stage, adjust payment schedule with a larger
percentage at the post contract stage, and withhold payment to alteration of designs without
prior MOEYC approval;
(iv) set a time limit for termination of contracts if contractors become non-performing;
(v) change the price adjustment clause in future contracts if contract sums can be agreed upon in
US dollars but made payable in Jamaican dollars at the prevailing exchange rate;
(vi) greater involvement of principals and the community from the planning stage: principals are
to sign-off on plans, and reduce the time between planning and implementation to avoid
demand change (i.e., increased enrollment);
(vii) focus more on safety to children during construction; and
(viii) enforce high standards in inspection and certification.
Furniture. Provision is made for schools benefiting from extension and refurbishment to receive
furniture. By the end of the project, due to delays in civil works, 10 of the project schools did not receive
- 15 -



furniture.
(f)    Strategies for upper secondarv education
The curriculum for upper secondary education (Grades 10 and 11) is very much influenced by the
regional Caribbean Examination Council (CXC) Examination which certifies the completion of upper
secondary education. There are mixed views about whether the ROSE methodology is conducive to high
performance on the CXC examination. MOEC has developed a two-track upper secondary program and
piloted it in 1997. This entails a regular two-year track (Route I) to cover the curriculum of Grades 10 and
11, and a three-year track for slow learners (Route II). Evaluation has shown positive impact on the slow
learning. However, this is a very costly approach to provide what is essentially remedial education in
Grades 10 and 11. A more cost-effective approach is to have compensatory education in primary education
and lower secondary education than in upper secondary education. The two-track approach is not
advisable, and unlikely to be mainstreamed because of the cost implications.
Component 2: Evaluation and Management Strengthening
(a)    Rationalizing the examination system
All activities under this subcomponent have been completed, with the except of the rationalization
of the examination system (by eliminating 16 JSC tests, and 3 SSC tests, and transferring to HEART 13
JSC and 16 SSC tests). 10 JSC score subjects remained, as there is still no alternative for replacing them.
Only 2 SSC tests have been eliminated, but 24 remain. The reason for not-transferring the tests to
HEART/NTA is because secondary schools are still not equipped to access their examination.
One of the most successful component is the introduction and improvement of the Junior High
School Certificate Examination (JHSC) which replaced the Grade Nine Achievement Test. The JHSC
Examination is based on the ROSE curriculum and serves placement, certification and monitoring
purposes. It was piloted in 1996, with growing number of candidates (12,565 in 1997, 18,663 in 1998,
20,901in 1999, and 21,081 in 2000). About 50 percent of P&JH students were placed in upper secondary
classes. Teachers were trained to set questions. Items banks were developed.
(b)    Establishing a Secondary Reform Management Team
See the section (b) under 4.1.
(c)    Public awareness campaign
The public awareness campaign has been successfully completed. Through a variety of media
(radio, video, expositions, newsletters, news sheets, news release and features, internet access, and
stakeholder workshops), the public had been made fully aware of the intent and scope of the reform. As
community embraces the reform, it is likely to be sustained.
(d)    ROSE Evaluation
Over the life of the project, formative and summative evaluations were carried out. These were mainly
quantitative in design. Evaluation includes the following: classroom observations; surveys of principals
view of ROSE; surveys of teachers' view of ROSE, Grade 7-8 Pre-test and Post-test measuring
achievement; Grade 7-8 Post-test measuring achievements; tracer studies of ROSE graduates from P&HJ
- 16-



schools, schools' profiles and monitoring of ROSE schools. An impact evaluation, funded by GOJ, and
carried out by the Program Evaluation Unit was completed in December 2000.
The Impact Evaluation consist of the following components: (i) analysis of perfonnance data in the
Junior High Schools Certificate Examination (JHSC), in primary & junior high, comprehensive high and
traditional high schools from 1995-2000; (ii) interviews of 28 principals/vice-principals and 84 teachers (a
total of 112 persons) in 28 ROSE schools - primary & junior high, comprehensive and traditional high on
various aspects of the program; (iii) classroom observation and analysis by subject specialists, of 300
lessons in the five core subjects in ROSE schools and non-ROSE schools; (iv) tracing of graduates of the
ROSE program including an analysis of their perceptions of school under the ROSE program; and (v)
analysis of CXC results since ROSE, 1998-2000 in 68 comprehensive and traditional high schools.
The Evaluation Unit's findings are as follows: (i) The performance data for primary & junior high,
comprehensive high and traditional high schools, in the JHSCE from 1995-2000, revealed a rising trend in
performance from year to year. (ii) The interviews revealed enthusiasm and positive attitudes towards the
program, on the part of principals and teachers. (iii) The classroom observation revealed widespread use of
the curriculum. The implementation of the methodology was greater in some subject areas than in others.
(iv) The tracer study of graduates of the program showed that a higher percentage of ROSE students were
continuing their education than non-ROSE students.
While many studies have been carried out, some aspects of evaluation design, instrument and data
analysis remained technically weak.
(e)    Support of preparation of Phase II of ROSE
The profile of ROSE II was submitted to the Cabinet, resulting in the GOJ's request for Bank
assistance in 2000. The Bank was pleased to continue the partnership to bring the reform to fruition. An
end-of-the project workshop was organized to obtain feedback on ROSE and recommendations for ROSE
II with stakeholders. Sentiments from the workshop attested that ROSE has widespread support within the
education system and is providing the right direction for teaching and learning in Jamaica. However, in
preparation for the next phase a number of recommendations bom out of the implementation process of
phase one were brought in focus: (i) other levels of the education system need to be aligned to ROSE
philosophy and methodology; (ii) ROSE practices need to be fully embraced and tailored to meet
school-identified needs; (iii) continuation, expansion and strengthening of the Ministry's role in providing
technical support in response to school-based demands; and (iv) the need for greater accountability at all
levels of the education system. These issues, it was felt, are key to any success of ROSE II
Summary of ROSE achievements and issues. On the whole, implementation was satisfactory.
The ROSE components that have met intemational standards (based on assessment by Bank staff and
consultants) included the following:
progressive curriculum for Grades 7 to 9 which is relevant to the nation and culture;
foundation textbooks in core subjects for students who read below their grade level; and
quality of Junior High School Certificate Examination (JHSC) at Grade 9.
However, implementation has not been smooth. Delivery of complementary inputs was not
synchronized. In-service training proceeded first together with delivery of curriculum guides, but delivery
of textbooks was a few years later and civil works came even later and were not completed by project
completion. So trained teachers did not have textbooks and laboratories to try out their activities approach
- 17 -



in the first few years. The project also has not implemented reading improvement, which has been deemed
to be critical in raising achievement at all levels.
Seven areas of improvement have been identified for ROSE II: (i) high standards for all students to
ensure that students from all backgrounds and learning styles have the opportunity to acquire the basic
skills, knowledge, and attitudes to become productive citizens; (ii) continued improvement of reading and
promotion of student self-learning; (iii) improving system accountability; (iv) emphasis on school-based
development; (v) connecting schools to the support they need; (vi) empowering schools with the capacity
and resources to become attractive to students at-risk; (vii) making schools into a quality learning
environment.
To fully and deeply integrate ROSE into school practice and to meet needs identified by the schools
themselves will mean that the Ministry will need to take on a significantly different role-one of technical
advisor and service provider. This shift in Ministry responsibility from an institution that focuses on the
development, acquisition, and provision of inputs to schools to one that responds to school-based demands
for technical assistance and continuous support is fully consistent with the ROSE philosophy and has
clearly already begun. The strengthening of this new role will be key to the successful implementation of
ROSE II.
Component 3: Social Policy Analysis Component
SPA: Implementation was satisfactory overall. About 4 percent of the grant of NLG 4,923,199 was not
disbursed mainly due to return of some ineligible expenditures.
(a) Establishment of a Social Policy Analysis Unit.
A policy analysis unit, the Policy Development Unit (PDU), was established and remains
operational for the whole life of the project. It carried out all of its mandates. The in-house analysis done
was a significant improvement in quantity, quality and timeliness over what had been done previously in
PIOJ. The abstracts for the Jamaica Survey of Living Conditions (JSLC) began to include time series,
graphs, standard errors, and tests for significant differences for the most important variables, as well as
documentation of the survey method adequate to guide users of the unit record data; the unit was
substantially involved in the creation of a poverty map which is used to target the activities of the Poverty
Eradication Program and the Social Investment Fund and has developed a methodology to consistently
track poverty over time. The in-house analysis, however, has usually stopped at the competent use of
descriptive statistics. Little causal analysis or simulation of alternative policies was conducted and even
the descriptive analyses often did not include statistical tests of significance for differences or trends
portrayed. Forays in this direction were being taken by the end of the project, but such tests were not yet
fully routine. Similarly, the unit was meant to sit at the heart of a network of social policy analysis. It
gained recognition as an actor in analysis, particularly of the Survey of Living Conditions (JSLC) and
poverty analysis and was often approached by other government agencies, intemational development
agencies and occasionally non-governmental agencies and commerce for analysis or information from the
JSLC. The PDU has also been approached by line Ministries for assistance in the design of studies,
including a request for assistance in the design of study to profile Food Stamp recipients (Ministry of
Labor, Welfare and Sports) and a study of extra-lessons (Ministry of Education and Culture). The PDU
did not, however, actively pursue its role of clearing house and repository for policy analyses across the
social sectors (irrespective of source of data, sector, or source of funds) as originally envisioned. A SPA
steering committee comprised of representatives from the PDU and the line ministries was constituted at the
time of project effectiveness and met monthly during the life of the project. The project was to establish a
- 18 -



Technical Advisory Committee to assess the reliability and validity of JSLC indicators on an ongoing basis.
This did not happen.
(b)    Linkages with Line Ministries.
The line ministries of Health, of Education, and of Labor and Social Security were to participate in
the definition of a program of social policy research, benefit from policy maker and staff seminars to
upgrade their respective policy analysis skills and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security was also to
benefit from a small amount of computer equipment and technical assistance. All activities except the
policymakers' seminars were carried out. One round of four courses of staff upgrading workshops was
offered. Seventy-three (73) public sector employees participated in the staff upgrading workshops (1 person
completed all four courses, 10 completed 2 courses and 54 completed 1 course). The Ministry of
Education was particularly pleased with the results of both the higher and lower level training courses.
Several staff completed courses in each program, and these staff have by in large remained in jobs that
require the skills taught in the courses. The Ministry of Health got the most from the project in terms of
research outputs, though at least two studies important to each of the other ministries were conducted. The
Ministry of Labor and Social Security most appreciated the small amount of computer equipment it
received. Few staff from the Ministry of Labor, Social Security and Sport attended the courses, the
technical assistance received was not catalytic and few studies on topics of interest to the ministry were
financed under the pipeline of research.
(c)    University of the West Indies (UWI).
At the UWI, all activities were carried out largely as planned. Thirteen faculty-upgrading courses
(also open to senior staff from the line ministries) were offered in review of mathematics, review of
mathematical statistics, multivariate analysis I and II, techniques of policy analysis methods and research
methods. At project completion, multivariate analysis I and II and research methods had been delivered
twice and techniques of policy analysis methods had been delivered three times.
The courses sponsored under the project were well attended and rated, though they catered more to
the current cadre of graduate students and less to the established professionals in academia and government
than intended. UWI, PIOJ and the contractor were very proactive in fine-tuning a second offering of the
courses and in offering the courses at different levels to meet the needs of participants with differing
mathematical and statistical backgrounds. The majority of public sector participants in these programs
were still in their jobs at project completion.
Curriculum was upgraded in similar graduate courses. The course descriptions have all been
approved as part of UWI's ongoing offerings. UWI had sought to maintain sustainability by ensuring that
posting in the Economics Department included multivariate analysis. The same attempt was made in the
Sociology Department through hiring for the 2- year Population and Development Training Program. The
Economics Department currently has on staff a lecturer who teaches a regularly offered multivariate
course. In the case of Sociology, the 2-year project has come to an end but multivariate analysis is now
included as one part of a graduate level course in Advanced Social Research Methods. The need, therefore,
still exists for the Sociology Department to create and staff a post that will carry forward the SPA
curriculum at a less technical level so that a wider audience -- including students from other faculties and
public sector employees - can access them.
Fifteen fellowships were granted (Sociology, l; Economics, 7; Education, 4; Consortium Graduate
School, 3). There is no detailed follow-up of what has happened to all of the students and whether they are
- 19 -



using the skills acquired in their graduate programs, however, an informal assessment indicates that most
are either continuing their training abroad (at least three economics students are in Ph.D. programs in the
United States, one staff member from the Ministry of Education won a Woodrow Wilson fellowship for six
months non-degree program at Michigan State based on a research proposal prepared using skills acquired
in the courses), teaching in Jamaican universities or working in public sector jobs in Jamaica.
Eleven studies were funded during the life of the project. Almost all of the studies were carried out
by individuals or groups at the University. Five of the studies will have been published by PIOJ (2 have
already been released and 3 are at the printers as of this writing). In all, about half of the contracted
research is at international academic standards. About half of the papers have direct policy implications
and the authors are well placed to see that the implications are acted on. The other studies are more likely
to inform policy indirectly through better understanding the phenomenon that policy might wish to affect,
rather than by, for example, evaluating the impact of a specific policy. The goal of the research agenda
was not only to provide policy impact through the studies, but also to help develop skills. However, there
has been relatively little synergy between the skills-building parts of the project and the research agenda.
Generally, the high quality research was delivered by those who had the skills to begin with. It still seems
worthwhile to have funded this work, both for its immediate policy impact and because it sets a standard
for applied policy research.
The Derek Gordon Data Bank at the Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social and Economic Studies
(SALISES) Formerly called the Institute of Social and Economic Research (ISER), it was operational for
most of the project. Data sets from Jamaica and other Caribbean countries have been acquired. It has
served participants in the courses sponsored under the project, graduate classes and individual students,
however, has not been utilized by sector ministries as was originally envisioned.
(d)    Support for Survev of Living Conditions.
The JSLC was conducted annually, various features of its quality were reviewed and improved,
and the capability of the Statistical Institute of Jamaica to carry out the work without foreign technical
assistance greatly enhanced. The Government is committed to providing funding to ensure that the JSLC is
continued.
Summary of SPA achievements. The overall outcome of the SPA Component is satisfactory.
Almost all components were implemented. Most resulted in moderate improvements from the situation that
existed before the project and, in some cases, the improvement was substantial. Subcomponents that have
met international standards are (i) the annual SLC and the report; (ii) about half of the research sponsored
by SPA; and (iii) teaching of policy analysis (including quantitative methods) at the University of West
Indies.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Economic analysis was not undertaken during project preparation. Therefore, this ICR does not
have any baseline to measure against and will not undertake economic analysis.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Financial analysis was not undertaken during project preparation. Therefore, this ICR
does not have any baseline to measure against and will not undertake financial analysis.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project has an important institutional development goal. Achievement in making an impact are the
following:
Student Assessment Unit. The Junior High School Certificate Examination is one of the major
successes of the ROSE project. The quality of the exam and the Student Assessment Unit's capacity have
shown continuous improvement. To ensure desired development for the long-term sustainability of the
examination component, more professional staff in the unit should be trained in the future in order to handle
the increasing demand for assessment.
MOEC has institutionalized the training arrangements in order to avoid losing the cumulated
knowledge and experience of trainers due to the end of contract. Best practices and lessons leamed from
the experience of principals over 4 years in managing reform need to be reviewed for use in future training
programs. To ensure the sustainability, acceleration of decentralized arrangements with an increase in
local capacity is recommended. The objective would integrate education service at the regional level with
MOEYC macro-management leadership would sustain the project objective.
The Jamaica Survey of Living Conditions has been institutionalized as the basis of social
monitoring and poverty assessment in the country and the capacity of the Statistical Institute of Jamaica
and the Planning Institute of Jamaica to field and analyze the JSLC has improved. The Polioc
Development Unit (PDU) in the Planning Institute of Jamaica has been established and institutionalization
is progressing. The Derek Gordon Data Bank at the University of the West Indies (UWI) was established
and operating costs are now funded by the University of the West Indies although future funding for the
Director of the Data Bank remains uncertain. Training in policy analysis and research methods has
strengthened the quality of teaching in the UWI and also built the capacity of analysts in a number of line
ministries.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5. I Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Macroeconomic conditions. During the life of the project, failure of some financial institutions had
triggered a financial crisis. The GOJ's efforts to support the banks had deepened the fiscal deficit. Debt
servicing during the life of the project has grown from some 40 percent of total government expenditure to
62 percent by May, 2001. This has led to difficulty in the provision of counterpart funding. The economic
downturn has also affected the financial capability of many civil works contractors in completing the
works.
Caribbean Examination Council (CXC) Examination at the end of Grade 11. The CXC is a
regional body which sets examination in all subjects at the end of upper secondary education. Since passes
in the CXC are used as criteria for admission to tertiary education institutions, and employment in the
public and private sectors, the examination curriculum essentially drives the subject chosen, content and
organization of secondary education. Therefore, there is a perception by some schools that ROSE
curriculum may not be sufficient aligned with the CXC syllabus and there is a need to overcome this.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
ROSE
- 21 -



While counterpart funds has not been an issue in causing incompletion of the civil works program,
it was a major reason for spreading out civil works in scheduling in order to ensure the availability of
funds. While works were spread out over the life of the project, once there is a slip on the part of the
contractors, the program could not be completed.
SPA
There has been no lack of counterpart funds, which was highly unusual in Jamaica during the
project period. There were no issues of macroeconomic or sectoral policies or of administrative
procedures.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
ROSE
Contract writing. The terms of reference for consultants' contracts were usually written vaguely
and did not spell out specific requirements for various stage of the production. A case in point is the JBTE'
s contract for the production of distance learning materials.
The open-ended price adjustment clause in contracts allows for cost adjustment due to fluctuations
in exchange rates, labor, and materials, and which gave the Ministry little leeway to control cost. This area
needs to be reviewed for improvement.
Screening of contractors. Excluding contractors which have a track record of non-performance
from consideration should be factored into the equation.
Realistic costing. The initial cost of civil works was seriously under estimated. This, combined
with delay in the execution of civil works during a highly inflationary period, resulted in substantial price
increase. Similarly, the real cost and time of designing, writing, proving, printing, and delivering of distance
learning materials have been under-estimated.
Documentation and continuous training of Secretariat staff. The project had 3 Coordinators and 2
administrators within the 7 years. During the year before projection completion, the position of Coordinator
was vacant for a year. This had resulted in an interruption of institutional memory and underscored the
importance of better documentation and continuous training in procurement and financial projection and
management.
Use of new technolog. It would vastly improve communication with the Bank if the Secretariat is
equipped with a voice mail system. It would also be important to make ROSE documents and reports
available to the public through the web.
Coordination of inputs. A major challenge is the coordination and synchronization of delivery of
inputs. While the changes in coordinators and administrators have contributed to the lack of
synchronization, with the current team in place, this problem should not arise with the next project.
SPA

The factors subject to control by the implementing agency, such as management effectiveness,
staffing, cost changes, implementation delays, use of technical assistance, adequacy of monitoring and
evaluation, and beneficiary participation were generally handled satisfactorily.
The only costs that deviated so substantially from those estimated at appraisal to affect project
implementation were those for the expatriate technical assistance for UWI. The winning bidder (the
University of Toronto) submitted a proposal that was about half the budgeted cost of the technical
assistance and also approximately half the price of the bids submitted by other bidders. PIOJ and UWI
decided to double the number of offerings of each course to be taught under the contract. This had a
tremendous positive impact on the project and any future project like this should program for two offerings
of the courses. This allowed the project to reach two cohorts of participants and also permitted substantial
fine-tuning during the second offering. In addition to the cost savings which made it possible to offer
courses more than once, there were other significant benefits from linking to a university as opposed to a
private consulting firm. These include the opportunity to develop continuing linkages that facilitate the
ongoing exchange of ideas, faculty and students.
Salary costs ran somewhat higher (even in real terms) than budgeted for at appraisal. The
reallocation among activities and budget categories was within the normal range for project
implementation. It should, however, be noted that since different activities served different constituencies
there were some issues of political economy around the minor variations that took place.
There were noticeable implementation delays at the beginning of the project, largely occasioned by
delays in project effectiveness (seven months after presentation to the Board), in the recruitment of the
permanent head of PDU (6 months after effectiveness) and in the establishment of the special account (nine
months after effectiveness). In spite of these delays, the project moved largely apace. The only substantial
delays were with the policy maker seminars and the research agenda. The delay in the policy maker
seminars is not easily justified. The delay in moving funds through the research agenda resulted from the
inadequacy of the mechanism as designed at appraisal and some delay in fixing it and also from the fact
that project design did not take into account the need to develop proposal writing skills prior to the call for
research proposals.
The government commitment to access to the highest level of policy makers and to high quality
appointments of key staff was somewhat less during the first half of implementation than during project
preparation or during the second half of implementation. This had some effect on the project, especially the
success of its networking with the line ministries.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
ROSE
There was substantial cost changes by subcomponent. The variation between SAR estimates and
actual project expenditures is presented in the first two tables in Annex 2. Most of the subcomponents did
not fully utilize the amount in the original estimates, except for civil works and the examination component.
Civil works expenditure was 4 percent over and above the original estimates, while examination
rationalization expenditure was nearly three times as much. The latter was attributable to the rapid
expansion of the JHSC examination to cover more candidates than originally intended.
SPA.
- 23 -



The higher salary costs are reflected in over utlizing the incremental recurrent cost in Category 3-A
by II percent. However, the return of ineligible expenditure on consultants' services had led to an under
utilization of Category I expenditure.
In both ROSE and SPA, financial management was handled well after the mid-term. With the
exception of delays in submission of the audit report, there was no serious issue of non-compliance in
financial management. The audit reports were unqualified, although they had identified that internal
control could be strengthened.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
ROSE: The reform of secondary education is highly likely to be sustained for the following
reasons:
Government commitment. The MOEYC has integrated its reform in its daily operation and has
allocated recurrent and capital budgets to support the continuation of the reform. The GOJ also requested
for Bank assistance of a follow-on project to deepen the reform.
Policy environment. The MOEYC's White Paper on Education (February, 2001) adopted policy
and set targets that are not only consistent with ROSE but also push the agenda much further beyond the
original conception to ensure the sustainability of reform in all levels of education in Jamaica.
Institution/management effectiveness. The ROSE Management continues to function and
exercise oversight of the reform. Unit heads who have gained so much experience in ROSE will continue to
implement the measures in ROSE II. Regional offices will support the decentralization drive to improve
effectiveness of supervision and support. ROSE trainers have been absorbed as regular staff in Teachers'
Colleges, and their experience and intimate knowledge of the teachers who went through the in-service
training will not be lost.
Technical viability. The project has contributed significantly to develop technical capacity in
curriculum development, textbook development, planning and student assessment.
Financial viability. The GOJ's high level of commitment to education is attested by the high levels
of public expenditure on education which is over 7 percent of GDP. In spite of the difficult macroeconomic
conditions, education is likely to receive priority attention in the budget process. However, it should be
noted that much of the increases in recurrent expenditure have been absorbed in teachers' salaries. It is the
non-salary expenditure that needs to be monitored to ensure that educationally effective inputs are
protected.
Stakeholders' participation. Principals, teachers, parents, and the community are committed to
working together. The whole education system is based on partnership. School-based management
approach, which will be supported by ROSE II, will further enhance the participation of the stakeholders.
SPA. The JSLC has been on-going for 14 years, moving from a pilot event heavily supported by
the Bank to a self-directed and self-sustaining operation. Much of GOJ's social policy was based on
- 24 -



analysis of data generated by the JSLC. The UWI courses are likely to be sustained, but it is uncertain
about the data bank.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Transition already began before the end of the project as all secondary schools adopt the ROSE core
curriculum. SPA has continued with conducting the JSLC.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
ROSE
The project built on the experience of a pilot of implementing ROSE curriculum in 11 schools in
1991, which was financed by a previous project. In this sense, the design was based on a time-tested,
workable experience. The project supported a centrally directed and supply driven approach, which was
quite common in projects of the early 1990s. While the project built the capacity and delivered important
inputs, for the reform to take root at the school level and to change behavior of teachers and students, the
follow-on project should adopt a school-based, demand driven approach. (See the Borrower's comments for
the history and details of identification, preparation, and appraisal.)
Weaknesses of the design included the under-estimation of the time needed to organize the
procurement of civil works, under-estimation of the cost of construction, and the lack of recognization of
the need for continuous training in procurement.
SPA.
Identification and Preparation. Under the Social Sectors Development Project, the JSLC provided
a regular flow of data and revealed the scantiness of existing analytic capacity. Following the experience of
that project, the GOJ and Bank easily agreed that a project to build analytic capacity was desirable.
Japanese grant funds for project preparation were used to hire a consultant identified by the PIOJ to
develop altematives and, once GOJ and the Bank had agreed on the strategy, to elaborate the project in
detail. The UWI and World Bank staff were also quite actively involved in project design, in an easy
collaboration with the GOJ consultant. This resulted in the preparation moving forward smoothly. This
process, however, did not enhance the ownership of PIOJ's working level staff.
Appraisal. The Bank was actively involved in appraisal, with suitable expertise provided. The
appraisal and project design were largely sound. There was, perhaps some element of over-optimism, but
probably less than in the ordinary run of Bank projects. Project dimensions and cost estimates were largely
appropriate. The implementation plan was detailed and implicitly contained substantial, suitable and
concrete performance indicators. It would have been beneficial to have clearer quantitative targets for
some of these and clearer indicators by which to judge the quality of analysis under the project. Some
risks, especially the complexity involved in having so many institutions involved and of trying to work with
line ministries that began at very disparate capacities were knowingly accepted.
There was little directly comparable experience among Bank projects to take into account when
this project was designed -- no other Bank project had largely consisted of capacity building around a
- 25 -



household survey. The Social Dimensions of Adjustment projects were the most closely analogous at the
time. Those efforts to build analytic capacity were relatively small and largely doomed by confining their
efforts to the central statistical agency so that links to policy makers and policy impact were undeveloped,
links to universities and a large pool of analysts were lost, and all efforts concentrated on a very small
group of staff and thus subject to considerable loss due to staff turnover. The SPA project component
explicitly sought a radically different design to overcome those problems. The project did take into account
experience in Jamaica in the predecessor Social Sector Development project. Subsequent experience in
building analytic capacity around household surveys in other countries shows that while the Jamaican SPA
project is the largest, its challenges and successes have common elements with other projects.
The design was complex, involving many small transactions and coordination between several
institutions. The risks entailed were acknowledged during the design period. Nonetheless, it was thought
that such a design was justified to reach critical mass in the network as a whole and to achieve optimal
linkages between researchers and policy-makers and policy-implementers. In retrospect, the managerial
burden on the Director of the PDU was greater than envisioned at design.
7.2 Supervision:
Because the implementing agencies of ROSE and SPA were different government agencies and the
two components were implemented in parallel, supervision was also conducted in parallel. The PIOJ, as a
coordinating agency of all external assistance, has an overview of progress in ROSE and SPA as their
officers attended the briefing and debriefing meetings of both components.  The MOEYC had
representation in SPA through the process of review of proposals and participation in the organization and
review of the education component in the SLC. However, there was no integrated reporting process of
ROSE and SPA, except in the financial audit report. The Bank team submitted its aide memoires and audit
reports on SPA to the Dutch Embassy in Kingston after the Dutch policy of decentralizing responsibilities
of supervision and reporting of its external assistance efforts from Washington to the Embassy.
ROSE
There was a succession of five Bank task team leaders, with changes not only during project
preparation but also up to the time of the mid-term review. These constant changes were not helpful to
build a stable partnership with the Borrower. After the mid-term review, there was no change in task team
leader.
The mid-term review observed that the need for the reform to take root in the classroom, to be
evident from changed behavior of teachers and students. This challenge has remained to be taken up by the
follow-on project. The other more obvious issue was the slowness in the implementation of the civil works
program.
After the mid-term review, the civil works program was restructured and the loan agreement was
amended, by reducing the number of new schools to be built and the schools to be refurbished and
extended. Even so, the civil works subcomponent could not be completed on time due to reasons explained
earlier. The loan amendment also included (a) reallocating the unallocated amount to civil works; (b)
rasiing the threshold for International Competitive Bidding from the equivalent of $500,000 to $1,500,000;
and (d) increase the aggregate limit for Local Shopping from $250,000 to $750,000. These changes, made
at the request of the Borrower, were designed to expedite the process of procurement in order for
implementation to make up for lost time.
- 26 -



Afterwards, the task team integrated technical advice on specific components with policy dialogue
during supervision. Supervision received a "highly satisfactory" rating from RSAI of the Bank's Quality
Assurance Group. The team used data generated from the project to develop a sector report on secondary
education (which was published as a Grey Cover report in December 1999) and used the analysis from the
sector study to inform the project, support the policy dialogue and guide the design of ROSE II. In
January, 1999, the MOEYC and the Bank jointly organized a stakeholders' workshop to discuss the
findings of the report. Representatives of principals, teachers, students, private sector, tertiary education,
the media, parliamentarians (including members of the opposition), PIOJ, Ministry of Finance, MOEYC,
and HEART/NTA were present. The feedback from stakeholders was very positive.
Supervision also took the opportunity offered by Human Development Week in 1999 and 2000 to
combine reversed supervision missions (MOEYC officials caming to Washington instead of Bank team
going to Jamaica) with professional development for 14 MOEYC officers. This experience enabled
representatives of the implementing agency understand Bank operations better because of the opportunity
of meeting with the Country Director, Sector Director, senior staff in HDNED, the Procurement,
Disbursement and Finance Management teams, and task managers working in other projects. Special
seminars were organized for the Jamaican team on secondary education in Europe and the use of
technology by the Bank and in education. The Permanent Secretary of Education made a presentation on a
panel on quality of implementation/supervision together with the task team leader in the HD Week in 1999.
The Bank paid special attention to financial management and provided much assistance to the
Project. The Bank could have done more on providing training in procurement, given the succession of
project staff.  Although the Bank took measures to assist the ROSE Secretariat to strengthen its
procurement capacity in 1999, the Project was approaching the end.
SPA
The Bank's supervision was adequate. Although the overall task manager for ROSE changed
several times during the project's life, the substantive review and advisory role was delegated during the
entire life of the project to a single staff member from the Development Research Group (previously the
Policy Research Department). The advice was, therefore, consistent and institutional memory was
maintained. The ROSE task managers and accountable unit handled the processes of issuing no
objections, filing of supervision reports, queries about disbursements and liaison with the Netherlands Trust
Fund authorities in the Embassy in Washington and with the Government of Jamaica. The processes were
accomplished well and usually in a timely fashion. There were occasional delays in communications with
the Netherlands autorities half way through the project, after the Netherlands decentralized its handling of
grants to the field, and nearly simultaneously turn over of personnel in the embassy in Kingston, as well as
a change of task manager in the Bank. The protocols the Netherlands wanted for handling exchange of
information remained unclear to the Bank for some time. In 1997 and 2000, there were changes in
personnel in the Dutch Embassy, which affected the institutional memory within the Embassy.
Miscommunications have been corrected.
During most of the life of the project, staff from the resident mission provided a small but
extremely valuable amount of time to advise the project unit on how to upgrade its financial management.
During the first few years of the project, the supervision budget was sufficient to allow the substantive part
of supervision to include troubleshooting, brainstorming and mentoring, a role that made good use of the
Bank's nearly unique expertise in this kind of project. Some general policy dialogue on poverty issues was
also conducted under this supervision.  In the last two years of the project, the supervision budget was
- 27 -



more constrained. As a result, the Bank was unable to participate when the government was determining
how to draw its poverty line, a role the Bank usually invests heavily to achieve.
There were no major deviations from Bank policies and procedures (e.g. on procurement,
disbursement, financing of cost overruns, use of cost savings, etc.). However, the ineligible expenditures
were used, including expenditures for which the grant funds were used to pay 100% instead of the
appropriate lower percentage, expenditures to a consultant who is a government employee (which is legal
under Jamaican laws but not eligible for project financing), expenditures for a laptop computer not actually
purchases and expenditures for bank charges/fees. The PIOJ had reimbursed the relevant amount.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Overall the Banks performance in all stages of the project cycle was satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
ROSE. The Bank and the Borrower worked closely together in preparing the Project. It built on
the experience of a pilot of implementing ROSE curriculum in 11 schools in 1991, which was financed by a
previous project. The ROSE Management Team went on a Study Tour to Europe to assess directly
experience of reform in other countries. In this sense, the preparation was well-thought out and laid the
ground work for committed imnplementation of this 15-year reform process.  The current Permanent
Secretary was the Bank's counterpart during preparation, and she continued to oversee the reform during
implementation to ensure its success.
SPA. PIOJ delegated project preparation to a consultant. The consultant chosen had appropriate
technical expertise. The use of the Japanese grant to hire a consultant to do preparation resulted in
expeditious and good quality work, however, it may have reduced ownership and the depth of PIOJ
commitment to the project. UWI's involvement in preparation and commitmnent were substantial. The
involvement of Statistical Institution of Jamaica (STATIN) and the line ministries was lesser, but
commensurate with their role in the project.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Same as below.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
ROSE. Implementation was not smooth during the life of the project. Although there was a
succession of coordinators and administrators during the life of the project, the structure of the
Management Team has ensured continuity of leadership. Overall, the compliance with legal covenants
was satisfactory. (Also see the Borrower's comments for details.)
SPA. The recipient's perfornance was adequate with respect to overall implementation. Although
the quality of management varied somewhat over the life of the project, a complex set of activities was
carried out with positive impacts, as described in detail in Part B. The commitment of UWI and STATIN
were considerable over the life of the project and both agencies contributed considerable staff time to
implementation and oversight of project activities.
- 28 -



There were very few covenants in the loan (e.g. with respect to macroeconomic or sector policies,
institutional changes, financial improvements, increased efficiencies and cost saving, etc.). The standard
covenants  with  respect  to  staffing,  provision  of  counterpart  funds,  procurement,  and
reporting/accounting/auditing were all adequately met. The provision of counterpart funds was particularly
good when judged by the prevalence of this problem in the rest of the Jamaican project portfolio. The only
unusual element among the covenants was a review of quality of JSLC data. This was done thoroughly
and those that could be achieved under project financing and without a major reorganization of STATIN
were implemented.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
ROSE. Overall borrower performance was satisfactory.
SPA: Overall recipient performance was satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
ROSE
The implementation experiences of ROSE, a project made complex by the multiplicity of
components and diversity of activities, has brought to the fore a number of important lessons:
(i)    Although ROSE has achieved such objectives as establishing the base for putting students at the
center of the teaching learning process and provided a system for support inputs, there is need for
deepening of the reform in such areas as:
*   greater emphasis on high standards for all students, especially those performing below grade
level;
*   greater support to schools to address various deficiencies;
_   improvement in the implementation process with performance indicators and greater
accountability
(ii)    There is need for further efforts to remove the perception that the ROSE curriculum in Grades 7 to
9 and the CXC programn is not aligned.
(iii)   The capacity of the private sectors construction industry needs to be assessed and strategies
introduced in the project design to improve cost effectiveness and the quality of work.
(iv)   Project design and implementation processes need to reflect the culture and capacities of the
implementing agency.
In summary, when the project was designed almost a decade ago, the focus was to provide the
necessary quality inputs and to strengthen the management capacity. To the extent that it lays the
foundation for the reform, the project was well designed. Nonetheless, the model was a supply-driven one,
and the main challenge for implementation, among other things, was for the Ministry to coordinate and
synchronize delivery of all the inputs. This model thus needs to be complemented by a demand-driven
approach in order for the reform to take root at the school level. This then lays the platform for ROSE II.
- 29 -



SPA
The principal lessons learned from SPA apply to future interventions of this nature in Jamaica and
to projects with similar goals elsewhere.
(i.)    Building analytic capacity is a slow and incremental process. It requires careful diagnosis and
planning and often two or three tries at a particular activity before that activity works as well as
desired and so that activities can have the required cumulative impact.
(ii).    The project was successful because it reached the broad network of people involved in generating
data, analyzing it and developing policy.
(iii).   The project was successful because analysts had access to data for training and research purposes.
Without open data access, this approach would not have been feasible.
(iv).   High level support from policy makers is important to getting a project to build analytic capacity
set up and can aid in its implementation.
(v).    A policy process that respects information as an input into decision making is required for policy
impact.
(vi).   Demand for data driven policy analysis is essential to the sustainability of capacity building
efforts.
(vii).   With respect to training, three lessons emerge: (1) demand is likely to be high; (2) participants
should be relatively homogenous in terms of mathematical background, computer literacy and
access to computer facilities; and (3) participants should be encouraged to enroll in a whole
program rather than individual courses so that both the trainees and the curriculum can build one
set of skills on the next.
(viii).  It is important to fund research to provide a testing ground for the skills learned. The process of
writing proposals and carrying out the research should, however, have adequate support functions
built in to mentor or coach researchers so that they improve their skills as they participate.
It can be difficult to staff a project designed to build analytic capacity, since by definition, there is a
shortage of persons with the skills required to staff the project. Thus, some capacity building may be
required among those staff as well. The pacing and ordering of activities should allow for this. Moreover,
leadership of a project like SPA requires a rare mix of administrative and research skills. It might be
worthwhile to separate the functions into two posts, especially if the administrative burden will be high.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
ROSE
- 30 -



The Project, overall, was satisfactorily administered and successftilly implemented. The
objectives of improving the quality and equity of junior secondary education and strengthening the capacity
of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Culture to plan and monitor the impact of the ROSE Program
have been met. The following paragrahs are comments on the partnership with the Bank.
Identification. GOJ's priorities for education, identified in the Five Year Plan 1990-1995and the
Medium Term Economic Framework, received support from the Bank with the signing of the loan
agreement for the ROSE project on May 7, 1993. Viewed within the context of its support, ongoing since
1966, the Bank made important contribution to the education sector. When the agreement for ROSE was
signed the Bank was then providing funding to its fourth project in the sector - the Education Programme
Preparation (EPP) and Student Loan Project (World Bank IV). The project had been specifically designed
to assist the MOEC in building the conceptual and analytical framework for the reform of lower secondary
education and to pilot the introduction of a common curriculum which formed the core of the ROSE
project.
Pre AppraisaL Lessons learned were incorporated into project design. There was allowance for
adequate planning and advanced preparation as evidenced in Bank involvement in Education Program and
Preparation (EPP) and greater attention was paid to institutional arrangements for project implementation
especially where the project was broad in scope In this regard GOJ and the Bank agreed that instead of a
traditional Project Implementation Unit, a Reform Management Team would be established to oversee and
coordinate the ROSE project. This team would also coordinate the interventions of all projects at the
secondary level in support of the policy of a common curriculum thus eliminating problems of duplication.
Appraisal. The Bank provided relevant expertise/consultants for all proposed components. In
addition a copy of a financial manual that had been had been developed with assistance from the Bank
under the Administrative Reform Programme was presented to the appraisal mission. The manual
established procedures intended to facilitate the flow of funds to projects and sought to address Bank
concems about the risk of timely budget support. The Bank, however, did not identify regular training of
relevant staff in its new procurementlaccounting procedures as a critical element given the possibility of
staff turnover. Such training would have offset concerns later about failure to follow procedures. The Bank
should therefore consider training in these areas for ROSE II and other new projects.
An appropriate financing package in keeping with its policy of supporting 80 percent of total
project cost was provided by the Bank. In recognition of project risk the Bank discussed with the MOEC,
inter alia, the recurrent cost implications of the reform. The final number of schools receiving civil works
was also reduced in order to bring the cost of the civil works to 50 percent of the reform support
component. The Bank had no objection to co-financing arrangements with the Netherlands Government
whose involvement helped to reduce the share of local contribution to the project to approximately 10
percent.
Supervision. There had been several changes of Bank task managers during the first three years of
the project. It was only after September 1996 that the same task manager remained with the project. Most
of the comments below were directed to Bank supervision efforts from late 1996 to date. The Bank and, in
particular, the current task manager, displayed a high level of attention and commitment to the Project. The
supervision missions, which often included experts in the various components, proved to be very useful in
dealing with implementation issues. During supervision, the teams not only identified obstacles to
implementation but also helped to diagnose the underlying constraints. Specially of note are the following
- 31 -



areas:
Civil works: The Bank addressed the delays in civil works in the first three years by appointing a
dedicated officer, who is a trained officer, in the then Resident Mission to work with the dedicated building
officer of MOEYC. He was available to answer questions and attend meetings with the civil works team,
architectural consultants and contractors whenever the needs arose. In this way, a lot of the procedural
bottlenecks were revolved, enabling the civil works component to make up for some lost time. After the
departure of this officer, the Bank's procurement specialist, assistant, and consultant continued to help
address questions.
Financial Management: The Project enjoyed a positive relationship with the Bank on matters
pertaining to financial management. In most instances, funds were disbursed within a reasonable time
frame. On rare occasions, funds were withheld but with subsequent clarification with the Bank's
Disbursement Unit, the problems were speedily resolved. The Financial Management Specialist was
especially helpful.
Examination: The Bank's performance in the supervision of the Examination component of the
Project was laudable. The close supervision of this component allowed for tremendous professional growth
of individuals and, by extension, the system at large. The availability of consultants in Assessment allowed
for immediate analysis, interpretation and solution of problems.
Evaluation: In the initial stages of the Project, the consultant from the World Bank developed the
evaluation design in conjunction with the Ministry. After the first year of the Project, an evaluation
consultant visited the Project once in 1997 but not afterwards due to the Bank's constraints on supervision
budget, although this consultant continued to comment on subsequent evaluation designs and reports and
the task manager followed up afterwards. The evaluation was carried out by the Evaluation Unit of the
Ministry (at times utilizing inputs from the Student Assessment Unit) and reports and presentations made to
stakeholders including visiting World Bank teams. The monitoring by the World Bank was rigorous and
demanding. A comprehensive picture of the accomplishments of ROSE was drawn not only from the
Evaluation Unit reports but also from the SLC, GSAT and JHSC examination data. The Unit welcomed the
process since it demonstrated interest in evaluation in general and the ROSE Project in particular.
However, it is recommended that, in future, more attention should be given to qualitative methods to
complement the heavily quantitative approach.
Two Reverse Supervision Missions was carried out in 1999 and 2000, with the ROSE
Management Team visiting the Bank to discuss the status of the project, to get familiarized with Bank
Country Director, Sector Director, and officers and procedures in procurement, disbursement, and financial
management. Combine with attendance at Human Development Week at the Bank, these missions
contributed to in no small way to the professional advancement of 14 MOE&C staff. Such transfer of
knowledge by the Bank's staff has redounded to the benefit of the entire education system. Strong
recommendation is being forwarded for administrative staff to benefit from any similar activity.
Policy Advice: The analysis and recommendations by the "Study of Secondary Education in
Jamaica: Improving Quality and Expanding Access" have proven useful and was well received in a
conference jointly held by the Ministry and the Bank with stakeholders in January 1999. The Ministry's
staff who worked with the Bank on the collation of the data, gained useful experience in data analysis and
collection.
SPA
- 32 -



The Project, overall, was satisfactorily administered and successfully implemented. SPA
met its principal objective of enhancing national capability for the conduct of sophisticated data research
and analysis. In essence, this was achieved not only by improving technical skills, but by promoting
greater orientation towards and interest in such analysis. In order to maintain and build on the momentum
achieved, it is necessary to continue to facilitate the utilization of the skills developed. In addition, it is of
the utmost importance to take the process further along the way to impacting on policy development. An
error in the Project design was the attempt to involve the policy directorate before the technical capabilities
and research output had reached a stage that could make such involvement meaningful. It should not be
surprising, therefore, that this aspect of the Project failed to materialize. Anticipation of the University's
preparedness to institutionalize the Project courses was similarly based on premature expectations. In
order to reap full benefits from the Project, it should be followed up by initiatives to consolidate the
advances made, assist in institutionalizing local training provisions, thereby ensuring continuity, and
promote incorporation of research output into the policy-making process.
(b) Cofinanciers:
Continuous discussions had been held with officials in the Dutch Embassy.  Since the
implementation of most of the subcomponents of SPA was completed by 1999, an ICR on SPA specifically
was prepared at that time and the draft was presented to and discussed with officials in the Dutch Embassy.
The SPA ICR had since been updated and the content incorporated into this ICR. Officials who had
followed the project expressed satisfaction with the achievements of the project. Although some concerns
were raised regarding the original design of linking SPA with ROSE, it was felt that both projects
benefited from the association. It was also felt that the strong ownership of SPA by the GOJ would
contribute to sustainability.
(c) Other partners (NGOs/private sector):
The MOEYC organized an end-of-the-project workshop to hear the views of stakeholders on the
achievement, shortfalls, and recommendations for the next project in February, 2001. Over 150
stakeholders and the Bank team participated. These stakeholders included principals, teachers, students,
private sector representatives, construction contractors, architectural firms, representative of the media,
parliamentarians, PIOJ, Ministry of Finance and MOEYC. The stakeholders were divided into 11 groups
and their feedback are presented in Annex 9.
