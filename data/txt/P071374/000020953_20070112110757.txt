I.INTRODUCTION

1.       This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors to provide an additional
grant in an amount o f SDR 6.7 million (US$lO million equivalent) to the Republic o f Rwanda for
the Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Project (H029- 1-RW). The proposed additional grant would help
finance the costs associated with an unanticipated financing gap and would consolidate the gains
from the initial investments, focusing on interventions with the most significant impact with
regard to HIVIAIDS prevention, treatment and care. These priority activities are consistent with
the recently revised National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan and take into account the availability of
funding from other development partners in an effort to assure harmonization and minimize
duplication. No changes to the project objectives, components, or implementation modalities are
beingproposed.


11. BACKGROUND       AND RATIONALEFORADDITIONAL FINANCING

2.       Country Context. Rwanda is a small, landlocked country in sub-Saharan Africa with a
population o f about 9.0 million and a per capita GDP o f roughly US$250. Around 60 percent o f
the population i s estimated to be poor and 85 percent lives inrural areas. As a result o f extensive
economic and governance reforms introduced between 1995 and 2005, GDP growth rates
averaged over 7.4 percent per annum. The decentralization reform o f 2005/06 resulted in the re-
drawing o f administrative boundaries, election o f new officials, and establishment o f viable local
governments with enhanced fiscal potential and a greater focus on strengthening capacity for
service delivery.

3.       Epidemiological Situation.     Health conditions have improved steadily over the past
decade with key indicators reaching pre-genocide levels. The country has made a successful
transition from post-conflict reconstruction in the health sector with the introductiono f important
reforms, some of which have been supported under the on-going project (e.g. performance based
contracting, community insurance schemes) and under the Poverty Reduction Support Grants. In
spite o f substantial progress the country remains off track in terms o f most health Millennium
Development Goals.      Curbing the AIDS epidemic will have a positive impact on the health
related MDGs as well as on economic growth (as most o fthe infected are o f primeworking age).

4.       Based on the availability o f enhanced sentinel surveillance and household survey data the
country now has more accurate, up to date information on the nature and scope o f the HIV/AIDS
epidemic than it did at appraisal o f the original project. According to the 2005 Demographic and
Health Survey (which was co-financed by the Bank through the on-going project) the HIV
prevalence in the Rwandan population age 15-49 i s 3 percent (confidence interval: 2.6-3.4
percent) with females over 1.5 times more infected than males (figure below), highlightingthe
sexual and economic vulnerability o f women. The HIV prevalence in urban areas has also been
higher than inrural areas (2.2 percent comparedwith 7.3 percent for urban areas).

5 .      GovernmentResponse. The HIV/AIDS program inRwanda is often cited as an example
o f best practice in terms o f strong government leadership, sound management, and good results
on the ground. As noted in a recent Comparative Advantage Study o f the Global Fundand World
Bank HIV/AIDS Programs, Rwanda has effectively put in practice the Three Ones: one strategic
plan, one coordinating body, and one monitoring and evaluation plan. This has produced a
coordinated and complementary effort by government, civil society and development partners.

6.       Over the past five years authorities have been successful in: (i)building capacities in
spite o f serious human resources constraints; (ii)channeling considerable resources through civil
society organizations which have a strong track record; and (iii)
                                                                harmonizingdonor assistance. A
notable example i s the innovative basket funding o f antiretroviral drugs and medications for
opportunistic infections for which the Bank and Global Fund finance generics and the U S
government through PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for HIV/AIDS Relief) procures brand
name drugs for the entire national program in a coordinated fashion. This strategy, which uses
the Clinton Foundation pre-negotiated prices and relies on country procurement systems, has
generated important cost savings, promoted the standardization o f drug regimens, and enhanced
planning and forecasting skills in the health sector.

7.       Program Results. The government o f Rwanda has made important strides in scaling up
access, improving coverage, and removing financial barriers for the poor to HIV/AIDS services.
Testing, which is the entry point for treatment, has increased dramatically through the
establishment o f a nationwide network o f about 230 voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) sites.
There has also been an important increase inprevention o f mother to child transmission services
with a total o f about 210 sites offering PMTCT (Prevention o f Mother to Child Transmission)
activities in comparison to 60 in 2003. Close to 180,000 pregnant women were tested in 2005
which represents roughly 90 percent o f women attending antenatal care.           Coverage with
Nevirapine prophylaxis rose from about 14 percent in2003 to close to 28 percent in 2005.

                                                  3



8.       The number o f patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) has climbed to over 32,000 at
132 sites in comparison to 870 patients/7 sites in late 2002 during the preparation phase o f the
original project.   If one takes into account those patients in need of immediate treatment,
coverage is estimated at well over 60 percent as not all HIV+individuals are at an advanced stage
of the disease. The adherence rate for those on treatment is estimated at 92 percent which is in
line with other well finctioning international programs.        Capacity to diagnose and monitor
patients on ART has grown substantially. Initially, only the National Reference Laboratory was
able to perform lab exams (CD4 counts) with sick patients having to travel to Kigali or wait for
test results. Today, the country has a network o f district hospitals with enhanced laboratory
capacities which serve not only AIDS patients but those requiringother tests.

9.       The percentage o f youths (15-24) who correctly identified ways o f preventing sexual
transmission and who also rejected misconceptions about how it is transmitted has more than
doubled inthe past five years (i.e. from 23 percent o f females and 20 percent of males in 2000 to
51 percent o f females and 54 percent o f males in 2005).       While there was a rise in reported
condom use (from 23 to 40 percent for females and from 55 to 69 percent for males) more needs
to be done to protect youth. According to the 2006 UNAIDS status o f the epidemic report
Rwanda appears to have experienced a decline in HIV infection rates among youth, results to
which the IDA finding has contributed.

10.      Original Grant. A SDR 22.2 million (US$30.5 million equivalent) IDA grant in support
o f the Rwanda HIV/AIDS Multi-Sectoral Project was approved by the Board on March 31, 2003
and became effective on August 11,2003. The project i s expected to close on October 30,2008.
As o fDecember 27, 2006 close to 95 percent o f the original grant amount has beendisbursedand
the remainder is filly committed.       The total grant amount will be fully disbursed by early
January, nearly two years ahead o f the expected closing date. The project supported the full
range o f preventive, medical and support services for people living with HIV/AIDS and aimed to
strengthen capacities at all levels to manage the national response.          The original project
development objectives, as stated in the Project Appraisal Document, were to: (a) strengthen
prevention in order to slow down the spread o f HIV/AIDS; and (b) expand support and care for
those infected or affected by the HIV/AIDS. The project is part o f the Multi-Country Action
Program against HIV/AIDS inAfrica (MAP).

11.      The project had four components: (i)public sector support; (ii)HIV/AIDS care and
treatment; (iii)civil society support; and (iv) program management, monitoring and evaluation.
Virtually all project activities had a nationwide and multi-sectoral focus and were funded on a
demand driven basis. The care and treatment component aimed to extend access to medical care
to three underserved provinces serving 2 million Rwandans. Project beneficiaries were civil
society organizations, public sector agencies, faith based groups, and grass root associations.

12.      Project Performance. Performance has been consistently strong with all targets met or
exceeded with the project expected to attain its development objectives. As o f today, close to
US$29.0 million have been disbursed or roughly 95 percent o f the original grant amount. Results
on the ground are solid. Main highlights include: (i)  fundingvoluntary counseling and testing for
close to 450,000 persons in both the public and private sectors, (ii) distributingnearly 12 million
condoms; (iii) placing about 5,000 patients on life saving antiretroviral therapy (which surpasses
the appraisal target o f 2,350); (iv) providing financial assistance for school fees to about 27,000
orphans and vulnerable children; (v) subsidizing access to community health insurance schemes
for over 52,000 households; and (vi) reaching some 100,000 individuals with income generating
activities which are having an important poverty alleviation impact. In addition, strong capacity

                                                 4


has been created at the national and decentralized levels to manage the HIV response. The M A P
mechanisms for disbursing funds have been replicated on a national level. The successes from
M A P systems for planning and monitoring resulted in their use as a blueprint for developing a
district-wide planning and monitoring system for HIV/AIDS.            The M A P has supported the
financing o f provincial monitoring agents, development o f operational and training manuals, and
designo f a database.

13.        Monitoring and evaluation (M&E)has been a focus o f the M A P since its inception and
an integral part o f its design. As a result o f this focus on and funding for M&E in the M A P
(9 percent o f total funding up to June 2006 was designated for this purpose), the team has been
able to consistently produce both quantitative and qualitative results (the data presented in this
additional financing project paper is evidence o f the availability o f data). The M A P M & E
system is integrated and linked with the national HIV monitoring and evaluation system.
Indicators have been synchronized with those o f the national program, and a core group o f key
indicators i s monitored and available on a regular basis. In addition, within the past year a major
effort was made to strengthen knowledge management and initiate evaluation studies. To this
end, a Beneficiary Assessment was carried out for the Mid-TermReview, a M A P Sourcebook o f
Good Practice was produced, and an impact evaluation o f the HIV/AIDS program and the
performance based contracting approach was initiated with M A P support. Finally, it should be
noted that the project has been well managed with ISR ratings consistently rated as satisfactory.
There are no unresolved fiduciary, environmental, social or safeguard problems. The
implementation o f the waste management plan has been proceeding well. The government's
commitment remains strong.

14.      Rationale and Reasons for Requesting the Additional Financing.               The proposed
additional grant would help finance the costs associated with an unanticipated financing gap and
would consolidate the gains from the initial investments, focusing on interventions with the most
significant impact with regard to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care. Demand for M A P
funding from project beneficiaries and absorptive capacity has beenmuch stronger than expected,
particularly o f civil society groups. Focus group discussions and a beneficiary assessment done
for the mid-term review found high levels o f satisfaction with the project which was cited as
unique in empowering beneficiaries and responding to their needs, particularly of civil society
and grass root groups. While other key development partners (e.g. Global Fund, USGPEPFAR)
are active in Rwanda these funds are fully committed. The government thus views IDA'S
continuing support as critical to addressing immediate funding gaps, using the M A P speed,
flexibility and participatory approach. A supplemental grant was the preferred instrument for the
government to consolidate the gains from the original IDA project while planning for long-term
sustainability through budgetary support and other sources o f funding.

15.      The government has requested additional financing o f US$10 million to enhance the
impact o f this well performing project by: (i) reinforcing prevention activities in priority sectors
(e.g. defense, police, education) through a consolidation o f voluntary counseling and testing
services, strengthening o f condom promotion, and enhancing workplace policies and programs;
(ii)supporting the decentralization andintegration ofAIDS care andtreatment inthe former
M A P provinces and planning for their sustainability; (iii)responding to the unmet demand o f
civil society groups to fund school fees and income generating activities with an increased focus
on microfinance to enhance sustainability; and (iv) putting in place capacities in the newly
established districts and consolidating support for institutional strengthening for key coordinating
bodies. These priority activities are consistent with the recently updated 2005-2009 National
HIVIAIDS Strategic Plan which have been reviewed/endorsed by the Bank and other partners.
The activities financed by IDA take into account the availability o f funding from other

                                                  5


development partners in an effort to further strengthen harmonization, minimize duplication, and
improve development effectiveness.
111.PROPOSED     CHANGES

16.      The project remains as originally designed and appraised. The proposed changes are
marginal and consist primarily o f updating the costs and financing plan. In contrast to the
original project which involved co-financing with the government, the supplemental grant will
finance 100 percent o f the project costs, in line with the new country financing parameters for
Rwanda (May 25, 2005).        Retroactive financing o f up to US$l.O million equivalent will be
provided for payments made since December 27, 2006. The economic, financial, and technical
justifications remain the same as in the original project.            The objectives, components,
implementation modalities and closing date remain unchanged. The waste management plan
remains relevant so no further safeguards study is required.           The allocation o f hnds by
component is presented below with the details in Appendix C.




Iv.  CONSISTENCYWITH THE CASAND I S N

 17.     The proposed additional financing is consistent with the Rwanda InterimStrategy Note
(Report No. 35331-RW, August 16, 2006) discussed by the Board on September 7, 2006. The
activities included are in line with two o f the strategic objectives o f the ISN, namely supporting
social service delivery and increasing capacity building. The activities are also consistent with
the results stemming from the initial consultations with government and development partners on
the Economic Development and Poverty Strategy to the extent that the project will contribute to:
(i) consolidating the results o f the current CAS by maintaining the gains made in the social
sectors, (ii)further improving coordination and harmonization of development assistance through
such activities as the basket funding o f drugs andjoint management o f the IDA and Global Fund
grants.


V. ECONOMICANALYSIS

 18.     The economic analysis spelled out in the appraisal document for MAP Icontains the
continuing justification and underpinnings for the Rwanda MAP, noting the potential negative
impact o f HIV/AIDS on the economy, health sector and on households. As part o f the on-going
project, an impact evaluation is being funded which will assess the socio-economic impact o f
HIV/AIDS on households.

                                                   6


VI. EXPECTED     OUTCOMES

19.      The outcome indicators in Appendix B will remain unchanged.              The main expected
         ....
outputs from the additional financing are as follows:

             An additional 250,000 persons tested nationwideinpriority sectors (e.g. defense,
             police, and education).
             Additional 3.0 million condoms distributedto target groups through public and non-
             governmental organizations.
             Cumulative number o f 5,000 patients on ARV therapy.
         9   Cumulativenumber o f 27,000 OVCs benefitingfrom payment o f school fees.
             Additional number o f 580 sub-projects for the fight against HIV/AIDS with a focus
             on microfinance.


VII. BENEFITS ANDRISKS

         The benefitsspelled out inthe original project remainvalid, namely:
         ... Slowing the rate o f new HIV infections.
             Improving the quality and extending the lives o fpeople living with HIV/AIDS.
             Generating savings for society and the economy.

20.      The majority o f risks identified at appraisal has not materialized or have been mitigated
as capacities have grown, political commitment has remained firm, and creative ways to
overcoming human resources constraints have been introduced (e.g. performance contracting,
decentralization o f care). The national HIV/AIDS commission (CNLS), which was a young
institution at project preparation, has proven its capacity to effectively coordinate a large and
growing portfolio. The management unit under the CNLS has effectively administered the grant
and has recently been cited by the country's Auditor General's Office as a top performer in terms
of getting hnds to beneficiaries and ensuring transparency and efficiency in grant management.
Some concerns remain with regard to weaknesses inthe health systembut the increased emphasis
on integration and the expansion o f the performance based contracting approach (supported under
the project and underthe PRSGs) will continue to enhance accountabilities and strengthen results
for both AIDS and non-AIDS services.


VIII. FINANCIAL TERMSANDCONDITIONSFORADDITIONAL FINANCING

21.      The additional financing will be provided as a grant through an additional Financing
Agreement to the Development Grant Agreement signedby the Government and IDA. The only
condition o f effectiveness i s that the Minister o f Justice has issued a legal opinion "showing that
the FinancingAgreement has been duly authorized or ratified by, and executed and deliveredon
behalf of, the Recipient, and is legally bindingupon the Recipient inaccordance with its terms".

                                      TECHNICAL ANNEX

1. DetailedDescriptionof the AdditionalFinancing

         The M A P supplementary funding o f US$10 million i s an extension o f the Project that
was envisaged to end in 2008. The strong demand for M A P funding and the growing capacities
in the country have resulted in a shortage of project funds by the end of 2006. Under this
supplementary funding, M A P will finance about 580 sub-projects that were approved but not yet
funded. In addition, selective NGOs and Umbrella organizations will benefit from financing o f
their Annual Action Plans, priority public sector organizations (e.g. MinistryofDefense, National
Police, and Education) will continue VCT and condom distribution and CDLS will benefit from
institutional support. Continued support for the health sector in the area o f care and treatment o f
the PLWHA will include the provision o f ARVs to about 5,000 persons in 12 hospitals and 19
health centers. Supervision o f activities, monitoring and evaluation o f activities implementation
will be done by the Project Management Unit (PMU).

    The project components remain as follows:
    *:*  Public sector component
    e:*  Civil society component
    *:*  Care and treatment component
    *:*  Coordination, monitoring and evaluation component

Project Component 1:Public sector support: US$1.8million

         This component will support a strengthening o f prevention activities through VCT and
condom distribution, enhanced workplace policies and programs in key ministries (e.g. defense,
national police force, education) and institutional support to all Plan o f Action implementers, the
umbrella public sector organization, CNLS and CDLS for coordination, monitoring and
evaluation as well as elaboration o f policy guidelines on HIV/AIDS related activities, and
capacity building.

Project Component 2: Care and Treatment: US$3.6 million

         This component will support about 5,000 patients on ARVs in 12 hospitals and 19 health
centers. The project will continue to purchase ARVs, and other medical consumables, and
laboratory reagents through CAMERWA using the basket funding arrangement with the Global
Fund and USG/PEPFAR. Support would also be provided to continue with the performance
based contracting for motivating personnel as well as other institutional support to hospitals and
health centers supported by the M A P to enhance the decentralization process and integration o f
HIV/AIDS care into the health system. Financing for incremental activities associated with waste
management needs are included inthe Supplemental Grant.

Project Component 3: Civil society component: US$4.0 million

         This component will support payment o f school fees for OVCs; support for 8 umbrella
organizations and finance o f 580 approved but pending sub-projects.

Component 4: Coordination, monitoring and evaluation: US$0.6 million

         This management unit at the CNLS will continue to supervise MAP activities, closely
monitoring implementation, and giving support and advice to partners, ensuring that trimester

                                                   8


reports are received on time, and disseminating information. All M A P data collection efforts will
be fully synchronized with the operationalization o f the national HIV M & E system - the same
data flows, formats o f reporting, frequency o f reporting, and supervision structures will be used.
The capacity of individuals responsible for managing the M& E aspect o f the MAP at the district
level will be built to ensure that they can efficiently carry out their responsibility. Specifically, the
focus on M& E inthe extended MAP will focus on ensuring that:

        The programmonitoring system i s fully operational.
        Supervision and data auditing i s strengthened.
        M A P database i s fully utilized by all staff.
        The MAP programmonitoring systemis complemented by qualitative data collection.
        Data dissemination is strengthened.
        Capacity o f M A P implementers and districts has been built in all aspects o f M A P M&E
         system.
        Performance-based contracting has been strengthened for M A P implementers.
    rn   'Demand monitoring' at district level has beenfully institutionalized.

        A follow up beneficiary assessment as a follow up to the baseline survey carried out in
2005 will be undertaken prior to completion. Finally, the project will have a final audit o f all
qualitative data as well as support an important an important impact evaluation.

2. ImplementationArrangements

         Project management will remain the responsibility o f the P M U under the auspices o f the
National AIDS Control Commission, working in close collaboration with the Ministry o f Health.
The P M U i s responsible for both the management of the M A P and Global Fund grants which
enhances harmonization o f investments and facilitates the process o f planning for sustainability.
Implementation o f project activities will continue to be carried out by a variety o f actors at
differentorganizational levels, including line ministries, districts, civil society groups, and private
sector organizations. Contracting out by Agence d 'Encadrement or umbrella organizations will be
promoted in order to make the best use o f the capacity o f these groups to reach smaller
associations.

Project Implementation Period

         The implementation period for the additional grant will be about 12 months. The project
is expected to disburse primarily during calendar year 2007. There i s no need to amend the
original closing date.

Capacity of the Recipient to Execute the Project

         The existing implementing agencies (line ministries, CNLSKDLS, districts, NGOs,
CBOs, umbrella organizations) which have performed satisfactorily under the original project
will carry out and oversee execution of the new activities. The proposed supplementary funding
will be subject to the same rigorous monitoring and reporting requirementsas the original project.
The CNLS will continue to perform its coordinating and monitoring role with regard to the
supplemental grant.

                                                  9


Procurement and Disbursement

         Procurement and disbursement procedures will follow the procedures applied under the
original Grant. The Project Management Unit within the CNLS has updated the procurement
plan, which covers all activities to be completed by the closing date.

3. Accounting,FinancialReportingand AuditingArrangements

        The following objectives o f the project's financial management system remain the same
for the additional financing, in accordance with OP/BP 10.02 These objectives are: (i)   to ensure
that funds are used only for their intended purposes in an efficient and economical way while
implementing agreed activities; (ii) enable the preparation o f financial reports that show costs
                                      to
budgeted and incurred for the current period and the total budget and cost o f the project to date;
(iii)toenabletheProjectManagementUnittomonitorefficientlyimplementationoftheproject;
and (iv) to safeguard the project's assets and resources.

        Given that the project's accounting and reporting system have been overall satisfactory
and that audit reports have been submitted on a timely basis and were generally unqualifiedthere
is no proposal to make changes in the implementation arrangements for the additional financing.
The computerized financial management system (TOMPRO) in place should continue to be used
to support implementation o f activities. Particular attention will be paid to the production o f
periodic financial reporting such as Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR). Disbursement o f the
additional financing will continue with two Designated Accounts, using the Reimbursement
Advance, Direct Payment and Special Commitment (SC) procedures.

        Rwanda's Country Financing Parameters o f 100 percent will apply to all eligible
expenditures under the project. The annual project financial statements will continue to be subject
to annual audits by private independent auditors, as well as periodic reviews by national Public
Control Institutions. The overall financial management risk remains modest, and the existing
mitigation measures under the original grant will continue to apply to the additional financing. In
addition, the streamlined integrated financial management information system augmented by a
robust M&E system will substantially enhance monitoring o f the project. The government's
strong anticorruption measures will continue to be emphasized, and close supervision o f the
financial management framework will continue duringthe implementation o f the project.

4. Environmentaland SocialAspects

        The proposed activities do not trigger any new safeguard policies or raise the
environmental category o f the project. Activities proposedunder the supplementary grant are the
same as were proposed in the original project (category B). The existing Medical Waste
Management Plan has been successfully implemented for the adequate handling and management
o f contaminated medical wastes. During execution o f the original project, no detrimental
environmental issues were triggered or raised as a result o f the project.      The supplemental
includes financing o f measures to assure that waste management practices at health centers
supportedunder the project are in order.
