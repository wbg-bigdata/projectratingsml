MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT
OF THE tNTERMATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A SOUTHERN JIANGSU ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommenda-
tion on a proposed loan to the People's Republic of China for $250 million
equivalont to help finance a Southern Jiangsu Environmental Protection Proj-
ect. The proposed loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including 5 7ears of grace. The loan would
oe onlent to Jiangsu Province, which would onlend the proceeds of the loan for
the municipal components ($246.5 million) to the four project cities at no
less than 85 percent of the Bank's standard variable interest rate for 15
years, including 5 years of grace. The municipalities would in turn relend
the proceeds: (a) to the industrial subproject entities: at the Bank's otan-
dard variable interest rate plus a spread of 1.5 percent per annum, with the
enterprises bearing the commitment charges and tLa foreign exchange risks; the
grace period would be up to 3 years, and the maturity up to 1D years and 7
years, respectively, for large-scale subprojects and for small-scale subproj-
ects and township and village industrial enterprise (TVIE) subprojects; and
(b) to the municipal sewerage companies and the Wuxi Hazardous Material Stor-
age and Trading Company: for fifteen years, including five years of grace, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with the entities bearing the
commitment charges and foreign exchange risks.
2.        Background.  During the last decade, China has initiated a wide
array of environmental protection policies and programs, and established com-
prehensive pollution control guidelines. In collaboration with the Chinese
authorities, the Bank recently completed an environmental strategy paper for
China (Report No. 9669-CHA, April 1992). This paper identifies major environ-
mental issues and their underlying causes, assesses China's policies and
institutional capabilities for addressing them, recommends areas for improve-
ment, and proposes a multi-year program of environmental assistance. This
would include a series of environmental operations in targeted cities and
regions, including the proposed project in Southern Jiangsu region (the por-
tion of the province south of the Yangtze River).
3.        Jiangsu is one of the most industrialized provinces in China.  Since
the commencement of economic reform in 1978, the rapid growth of rural collec-
tive and private industry has been the most remarkable aspect of Jiangsu's
recent economic development. However, in contrast to the record of economic
achievement are the serious environmental problems in Southern Jiangsu.
4.        Rapid industrialization, urbanization and population growtb in
Southern Jiangsu have overwhelmed the natural assimilative capacity r the
environment. Industry is by far the major source of pollution, accounting for
70 to 80 percent of the total pollutant loading in the region. Industry is
primarily concentrated in Southern Jiangsu. The four municipalities in the



- 2 -
region which vill participate in the iroject are Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou and
Zhenjiang. There is already an enormous backlog of investment required to
redress the more serious environmental problems in the region. In the absence
of adequate environmental management programs, increasingly severe environ-
mental degradation has serious ramifications, posing health hazards and under-
mining sustainable development. It is in this context that the Chinese
authorities have accorded high priority to environmental protection in South-
ern Jiangsu.
5.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement.  The Beijing
Environmental Project (Credit 2312 and Loan 3415) and the Ship Waste Disposal
Project (Credit 2391 and GEF Grant TF28613) were the first two free-standing
environmental operations in China which were recently approved by the Bank.
In addition, the Bank Group has been involved in five urbar. and water sup-
ply/sanitation projects in China which are also related to pollution control.
Despite the complexity of these ongoing projects, and tha initiai unfamiliar-
ity of project officials with Bank requirements, implementation progress is
satiafactory. The common elements of good practice learned under these proj-
ects include the importance of: (a) commitment of the municipal authorities
concerned to implement the projects; (b) strong project management offices
(PHOs) with adequate staff to provide the requisite coordination among multi-
ple agencies; and (c) thorough project preparation based on detailed feasibil-
ity studies prepared by competent agencies and consultants, well prepared
bidding documents and technical specifications.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Jiangsu Province and the four proj-
ect cities have the requisite institutional framework and commitment to carry
out a successful environmental operation. During the course of project prepa-
ration, the Bank assisted the provincial and municipal authorities in the
development of a coherent environmental strategy and action plans for Southern
Jiangsu and each of the four cities in the region. The proposed project,
which is an important part of the environmental action plans, would demon-
strate sound approaches toward sustainable environmental protection. Bank
participation also contributed to improvements in the project design through
the initiation and monitoring of various preinvestment studies. Further, the
Bank was instrumental in effecting up-front actions for the reorganization and
corporatization of the sewerage utilities, and the establishment of a sound
cost recovery policy to sustain efficient and effective operations of these
pollution abatement services. Finally, the proposed operation would initiate
support for toxic/hazardous material and waste management as well as TVIE
environmental management in China. The good practices learned under this
project would have a significant demonstration effect for other regions in the
country.
7.        Project Obiectives.  The objective of the project is to reduce the
widening gap between economic development and environmental protection in
Southein Jiangsu in an efficient and effective manner. In particular, the
project would focus on cost-effective water pollution control which is
accorded the highest priority in the environmental management strategy for the
region. The specific objectives of the project includet (a) improvements in
the formulation, monitoring and enforcement of environmental policies and
regulations; (b) enhancement of industrial point source pollution control in
both urban and rural areas; (c) improvements of municipal wastewater manage-



- 3 -
ment; (d) initiation of toxic/hazardous material and waste management; and (e)
strengthening the environmental planning and management capabilities of the
entities responsible for environmental protection in the region.
8.        Proiect Description.  The main project components would comprise:
(a) support for industrial pollution control (81 percent) through provision of
a line of credit for large-scale industrial subprojects in the urban areas of
Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou and Zhenjiang; emall.-scale industrial subprojects and
pilot township and village industrial enterprise (TVIE) environmental manage-
ment subprojects in Greater Suzhou and Wuxi; (b) construction of municipal
facilities for urban wastewater management (14 percent) in Wuxi, Changzhou and
Zhenjiang; (c) hazardous waste management components (2 percent) including
establishnent of solid and hazardous waste management and registration centers
in Jiangsu (JMRC) and Wuxi (WMRC) as well as a hazardous material emergency
response center in Wuxi, and construction of hazardous material storage and
transshipment facilities in Wuxi; and (d) technical assistance and training
(3 percent) for the provincial and municipal environmental protection bureaus
(EPBs), municipal sewerage companies, hazardous material storage company and
the industrial subproject financial agent (China Investment Bank, Jiangsu
Branch).
9.        Prolect ImDlementation.  Overall project implementation would be
overseen by a Provincial Leading Group, headed by a Deputy Governor, and a
provincial Project Management Office (PMO). Similarly, each of the four
municipalities under this project has estiblished a Bank loan administration
Leading Group and municipal PMOs. Autonomous enterprises have been set up to
implement the proposed urban wastewater management components and the hazard-
ous material storage and transshipment component in Wuxi. In addition, JMRC
would be implemented by the Jiangsu Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB),
w ;le WMRC and the hazardous material emergency response center would be
implemented by Wuxi municipal government departments (EPB, hospital and fire
department).
10.       The Bank loan would be disbursed against a line of credit ($198 mil-
lion) for the industrial pollution control components. In view of the differ-
ent profiles of projected cash flow and related debt servicing capability of
small and larger subprojects, the proposed repayment period for the former
would be shorter. With a view to sustaining the flow of funds for small-scale
subprojects and TVIE subprojects, Suzhou and Wuxi municipal governments would
establish environmental revolving funds to channel their own funds and recycle
repaid loan funds from these types of subprojects.
11.       The China Investment Bank (CIB), Jiangsu Branch, would be the finan-
cial agent for the municipal governments for overall subproject appraisal.
The municipal governments would bear the relevant credit risks.  In addition,
CIB Jiangsu would administer the disbursement and collection of subloan repay-
ments for the subprojects, review the contract packages for the various indus-
trial subprojects, and determine the methods of procurement required.   The
procedures for procurement would be the same as those for Bank-financed CIB
projects which the, Bank has reviewed and found satisfactory.  CIB would sub-
contract appropriate agents for technical appraisal of the subprojects.

12.       The total project cost (excluding interest during construction) is
estimated at $551 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
$268 million equivalent (49 percent). The total financing requirod, including
interest during construction, is $5S8 million, of which the Bank would finance
$250 million equivalent (77 percent of the foreign exchange and 8 percent of
local costs). A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Retroactive financing of up to $2 million is provided for
expenditures incurred after October 31, 1992 covering urgently needed techni-
cal assistance and training required for detailed project design and implemen-
tation. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps on project location and water qual-
ity of the project cities (IBRD Nos. 24512, 24513, 24514 and 24515) are also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, Report No. 11370-CHA, dated
February 16, 1993, is being distributed separately.
13.       Proiect Sustainabilitv.  The project has adopted an integrated
approach to improve the enabling environment for sustainable pollution abate-
ment, including improvements in the formulation of environmental regulations,
institutional strengthening for enhancing the monitoring and enforcement capa-
bilities of the local EPBs, corporatization of sewerage utilities and estab-
lishment of sound cost recovery policies for these pollution abatement ser-
vicess and promotion of cost-effective, cleaner technologies and waste minimi-
zation practices, which would provide financial incentives for industrial
pollution control. In view of the commitment by the provincial and municipal
governments to implement the above measures, the environmental protection
efforts initiated under this project are expected to be sustained.
14.       Aareed Actions.  During negotiations, assurances have been obtained
from Jiangsu Province to carry out, or cause the municipalities concerned to
carry out the following: (a) implement the strategy and action plans agreed
with the Bank for environmental management in Southern Jiangsu and each of the
four municipalities; (b) prepare, promulgate and implement appropriate regula-
tions, safety and operating rules for municipal sewerage systems, and
toxic/hazardous waste management; (c) establish and operate environmental
revolving funds under procedures satisfactory to the Bank; (d) maintain the
leading groups and project management offices at both the provincial and
municipal levels with functions and staffing satisfactory to the Bank; (e)
carry out a resettlement program satisfactory to the Bank; (f) carry out tar-
iff studies for sewerage operations and for hazardous material storage and
transshipment; (g) annually furnish to the Bank the rolling long-term finan-
cial plans of the sewerage companies and Wuxi Hazardous Material Storage and
Trading Company (WMSC) and review their future finances with the Bank; and (h)
cauee the sewerage companies and WMSC to maintain at least a break-even reve-
nue position, and satisfactory debt service coverage ratios, self-financing
ratios and total liabilities/equity ratios.
15.       Execution of the subsidiary loan agreements bet-ween the municipali-
ties and the three sewerage companies and WMSC, satisfacto.-y to the Bank,
would be a condition for loan effectiveness. The following would be condi-
tions of disbursement for the proposed urban wastewater management components:
(a) all the municipal sewerage treatment plants under the project would have



obtained wastewatar discharge permits for their existing operations and tempo-
rary discharge permits for the operation of the proposed sewerage components;
and (b) the provision of resettlement plans, satisfactory to the Bank, for all
three prelect cities.
16.       Resettlement.  Some 370 persons would be affected by the proposed
sewerage componenits. The principles and monitoring indicators for resettle-
ment were agreed during negotiations. Most of the detailed design of these
components would be completed by mid-i993; the resettlement plan of these
components is expected to be revised, as appropriate, upon the completion of
the detailed design.
17.       Environmental Assessment.  Chinese regulation requires the prepara-
tion of an environmental assessment (EA) report at the time of project design.
The EA reports of the sewerage and hazardous waste management components and
selected industrial subprojects were reviewed by the Bank and found satisfac-
tory.
18.       Prolect Benefits.  The proposed project would significantly mitigate
environmental degradation and result in both economic and social benefits for
Southern Jiangsu. Specifically, the industrial subprojects have been designed
to achieve both pollution reduction and improvements in operational efficiency
through structural transformation to efficient and low polluting technologies,
waste minimization/reuse, improved economy of waste treatment and, as appro-
priate, product upgrading. These subprojects would effectively integrate both
environmental and economic objectives on a sustainable basis. Further, water
pollution control at industrial sources would translate into reduced costs for
water treatment and urban water supply. In addition, health benefits would
accrue from the reduction of water-borne diseases and control of toxic/hazard-
ous wastes. Moreover, improved water quality under tEe project would benefit
irrigation, navigation, land4 value and tourism in the region. The economic
rates of return of the proposed sewerage components in Zhenjiang, WUxi and
Changzhou have been estimated at 14 percent, 16 percent and 17 percent,
respectively. Finally, the project would contribute to the sustainability of
environmental management in the region by the demonstration of cost-effective
pollution control measures, by strengthening local capabilities in the moni-
toring and enforcement of environmental regulations, the corporatization of
the sewerage utilities, and the establishment of a sound cost recovery policy
for these pollution abatement services.
19.       Risks.  To reduce risks of delay in implementation of the project
which covers multiple cities, sectors and agencies, agreement has been
obtained from Jiangsu to ensure an adequate and timely flow of local counter-
part funding as well as satisfactory arrangements for project management,
including the maintenance of project management offices at both the provincial
and municipal levels with functions and staffing satisfactory to the Bank.
Further, the requisite technical assistance and training in project implemen-
tation would be provided under the project. Much work, beyond that of the
present proposed project, would still be required before the long term goals
of environmental improvement can be reached. In view of the commitment by the
provincial and municipal governments to implement a comprehensive environ-
mental strategy and action plans, including measures to improve the enabling



environment for pollution abatement, efforts to continue environmental protec-
tion work are expected to be sustained.
20.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
