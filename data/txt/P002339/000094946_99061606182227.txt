IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
CREDIT No. 1868-SN
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Industrial Sector Restructuring
Project in the Republic of Senegal, for which a credit in the amount of SDR 25.0 million (US$33
million equivalent) was approved on December 22, 1987, and became effective on October 31,
1988. The total project cost was US$40.8, of which US$31.3 million was for financing industrial
investments, US$6.2 million for retraining laid-off workers and helping them start new businesses,
and US$3.3 million for technical assistance. IDA financed about 80% of project costs; the
Government about 3%, and the private sector about 17%.
During implementation, the credit was restructured twice, in October 1990 and November
1995, the latter after the CFAF devaluation in January 1994. The credit was closed on June 30, 1998
but for certain committed expenses, the payment period was extended to October 31, 1998. The
credit was fully disbursed by the end of October 1998.
The ICR was prepared by Cherif M. Azi (Sr. Operations Officer) and Mustafa Soykan (Consultant),
and was reviewed by David Cook (Acting Sector Manager, AFTP1) and Mahmood A. Ayub
(Country Director, AFC 14). Pushpa N. Schwartz edited the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion mission
during June 12-22, 1998. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by preparing its
own evaluation of the project's implementation (Appendix E). Comments from the Senegal Country
Team and Task Managers, who had appraised or supervised the project, were incorporated into this
ICR.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
(Credit No. 1868-SN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    Since Independence, Senegal has been one of the most politically stable countries in West
Africa. Its industrial sector was also one of the most advanced in the region. In the early 1 980s, it
comprised some 300 enterprises, mostly privately owned. Agro-industries, which included the
export-oriented groundnut- and fish-processing industries as well as the import-substituting sugar
industry, accounted for nearly half of the sector's employment and value added in the economy. The
industrial sector was, however, characterized by minimal diversification and integration, and its
recent performance had been disappointing.
2.    The poor performance of the sector was partly attributable to inappropriate sector policies,
which included high tariff barriers and numerous quantitative restrictions. The incentive system was
inefficient and favored privileged individual enterprises. The export-promotion instruments were
ineffective and the regulatory framework was cumbersome. IDA financed SALs II and III whose
objectives were to remove these constraints and liberalize the economy. The Industrial Sector
Restructuring Project was conceived to support and complement Government's efforts to encourage
private sector development.
Project Objectives
3.    The main objectives of the project were to: (i) provide financing to restructure existing
industrial enterprises as well as for viable new investments; (ii) support programs of assistance for
laid-off industrial workers to alleviate the social cost of the reform; and (iii) strengthen the
institutions involved in the industrial sector's adjustment process. The Project was restructured
twice, first, in October 1990 to allow the financing by participating banks of feasibility studies as
well as of working capital. The second restructuring, in November 1995, after the CFA devaluation,
was needed to modify the conditions of the Apex line of credit, to cancel the components and
activities that had no chance to succeed and reallocate the undisbursed amount to the Apex line of
credit.
4.    The objectives of the project were clearly defined, consistent with the Bank strategy in
Senegal and with the needs expressed by the Government i.e., to provide long term resources to
finance investment projects and to support assistance program to mitigate the negative impact of the
reforms on the workforce. Each of the objectives was supported by specific project component.
However, the second objective, although laudable, was too ambitious and unrealistic. No
retrenchment program or social plan was prepared by the Government or the enterprises to alleviate
the negative social impact of the reform. In November 1995, it was agreed to canceled this
component.

Implementation Experience and Results
5.    The overall outcome of the project is rated satisfactory. The APEX line of credit for
financing industrial enterprises had a difficult and slow start but, at project closing, its sub-project
portfolio performance was impressive. During the project's last three years, the line of credit
financed 25 sub-projects, all of which were problem-free. Only four small sub-projects in the 40
sub-project portfolio had repayment problems, representing less than 2% of the line of credit. The
experience helped to build the confidence of the local banking system and financial markets. It had
a catalytic effect on the participating banks, giving them incentive to extend longer-term credit to the
industrial sector. Information from the commercial banks and the sub-projects financed revealed that
potential demand for the APEX type of credit certainly does exist and that medium-term private
savings can be mobilized for the development of Senegal's industrial sector.
6.    The initial slow disbursement of the line of credit was due to: (i) the absence of demand
because of the lack of competitiveness in the industrial sector before the devaluation in January
1994; (ii) new and complicated credit application and evaluation procedures in a country where this
project was the first of its kind; (iii) restrictive requirements and financial-eligibility criteria for sub-
loans; (iv) the loan-application process, transparency, and advantages of the APEX line of credit
which were not well understood by some banks or they made too little effort to comprehend and
apply them. After the devaluation and the second project restructuring - that simplified the
conditions of the line of credit - it was disbursed very quickly.
7.    The components for helping laid-off workers and TA to the export credit insurance agency
and the export promotion agency either were not implemented or their results were negligible. The
TA for the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEMI) was not realized because of procurement
problems, but the TA for the Ministry of Commerce, Industrialization, and Handicrafts (MCAI)
achieved its objectives.
8.    The project results are likely to be sustained: sub-projects financed with the APEX line of
credit are repaying their debts and continue to produce and export. Their contribution and success is
promising for the development of the private sector in the country. The banking system has gained
valuable experience through its technical input into the design and supervision of sub-projects. The
experience with the APEX line of credit, assessing the viability of sub-projects, and enforcing the
financial criteria have built up the confidence of commercial banks and they are better equipped now
to mobilize financial resources to invest in and promote private sector development.
9.    Bank performance in the identification and preparation of the project was satisfactory.
Project appraisal was marginally satisfactory. The foreign exchange risk and its impact on potential
sub-projects were not properly assessed and as a result implementation was almost at a standstill in
the early years of the project. Bank supervision was highly satisfactory. Problems were clearly
identified and as a result, the project was restructured twice. The Borrower performance during
project preparation was deficient. Some of the components were not in line with the existing level of
implementation capacity. Furthermore some components were not designed at all; the program to
assist the laid-off employees, is a case in point. Borrower performance during implementation was
satisfactory.

Summary of Findings and Key Lessons Learned
10.  In the early years of the project, the difficult macroeconomic conditions and the unfavorable
environment for private investment have had a negative impact on project implementation. It is only
after the devaluation - which directly contributed to improving the economic and business
environment - and after the swift implementation of a vigorous reform program supported by IDA
under the Private Sector Adjustment Project that the project really achieved its objective of
providing resources to finance investment projects. The project created, modernized, or expanded
37 productive industrial enterprises and contributed substantially to industrial growth.  The
contribution and impact of the industrial sub-projects on the economy need to be carefully studied
and their sustainability monitored to help design future programs and policies. The responsibility for
doing so rests with the Government, although assistance from the donor community would be
welcome.
11.   The key lessons learned from implementation of this project are:
(i)   Project objectives should be in harmony with the global business environment. One of the
first steps in the preparation of projects whose objective is to provide resources to finance productive
investment should be to ascertain that the macroeconomic conditions are favorable to private
investment. If the conditions are not favorable, project objectives should be modified to reflect the
need to create a favorable macroeconomic, legal, institutional environment before establishing any
fnancing scheme.
(ii)   All project objectives should be simple, realistic, and readily achievable, and when several
institutions are involved in project implementation, adequate mechanisms should be established to
ensure proper coordination between them. The project sub-components not implemented or
implemented unsatisfactorily dealt with the identification and training of laid-off workers, and
helping them find jobs or start new businesses. These sub-components, which represented a small
part of the project costs, were neither clearly identified nor well designed and the institutional
structure for their implementation was lacking.
(iii)  Both the supply and demand sides of "the products" offered by the project, as well the
interest of the intermediary institutions to deliver them should be carefully assessed during appraisal.
The SAR did not assess the demand side of APEX line of credit appropriately. The demand for
credit among the existing entrepreneurs was unknown and the willingness and ability of the
commercial banking system to disburse the APEX line of credit was also not known. Before
devaluation, the demand for credit was low. The softening of the sub-loan conditions after project
restructuring helped to increase demand and contributed to project success.
(iv)   When the design of a project includes intermediaries whose contribution is critical to the
success of the project (in this case, the commercial banks were he intermediaries between the
Government and the Beneficiaries), the project should provide strong incentives to theses
intermediaries. It is only after the devaluation, that the commercial banks discovered the advantages
of the attractive spread and repayment terms that the APEX line of credit offered, and they became



iv
more familiar with IDA procedures and requirements. They overcame the processing and
administrative difficulties in the preparation and application of sub-project loans. The attractive
credit loan incentives and the improved economic environment created a strong motivation among
the commercial banks as well as the private entrepreneurs to mobilize and invest medium-term
resources for productive investments.
(v)   To encourage industrial development, frequent consultation needs to be undertaken with the
private sector and its creative and practical suggestions considered seriously. The Government
should hold a continuing dialogue with the financial and industrial sectors to identify the remaining
constraints to industrial growth and take measures to eliminate them. Enterprises, for example, want
a simplification of administrative procedures, such as those dealing with customs duties, which lack
transparency and discourage them from importing products and creating new enterprises. They
should have also receive friendly, favorable, and non-discriminatory treatment from the authorities.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
CREDIT No. 1868-SN
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. BACKGROUND
1.    Senegal has been one of the most politically stable countries in West Africa. Its industrial
sector was also one of the most advanced in the region. It comprised some 300 enterprises, mostly
privately owned.  Agro-industries, which included the export-oriented groundnut- and fish-
processing industries as well as the import-substituting sugar industry, accounted for nearly half of
the sector's employment and value added in the economy. The sector was, however, characterized
by minimal diversification and integration, and its recent performance was disappointing.
2.    The poor performance of the sector was partly attributable to inappropriate sector policies,
which included high tariff barriers and numerous quantitative restrictions. To address theses
constraints, the Government initiated, in the early 80s, a comprehensive program of reforms
supported by SALs II and III, The reforms were expected to affect the structure of the industrial
sector and force individual enterprises to restructure. To help industrial enterprises to seize new
growth opportunities and encourage private sector development more directly as well to support and
complement Government's efforts, the Industrial Sector Restructuring Project was conceived.
Unfortunately, soon after the project was approved most of the reforms adopted by the Government
were either suspended or reversed because of social pressures.
3.    Since the CFAF devaluation in January 1994, the economic environment has improved.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth accelerated from 2% in 1994 to an average of 5% over the
next four years, while the inflation rate fell from 34% in 1994 to 3% in 1997. The private sector's
share of GDP grew to 82%, representing almost all the value added in the primary sector and 80% in
the rest of the economy.
B.  STATEMENT AND EVALUATION OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.    The objectives of the Industrial Sector Restructuring Project were to:
(a) provide financing to restructure existing industrial enterprises as well as viable new
industrial investments;
(b) support programs of assistance for laid-off workers in order to help alleviate the negative
social impact of the reforms; and
(c) strengthen the institutions supporting the adjustment process.
5.    The project's three major components were:



2
* An APEX line of credit (US$25 million) located at the Central Bank to finance, through the
banking system, fixed investments and working capital requirements of existing and new
enterprises;
* a retraining and small-scale enterprise (SSE) program for laid-off employees of the industrial
sector (US$5 million); and
* a technical assistance (TA) component (US$3 million) to strengthen the Ministry of Industry and
Handicrafts (MDIA), restructure two export-promotion institutions--CICES (Centre
International du Commerce Exterieur) and ASACE (Agence Senegalaise d'Assurance Credit a
l'Exportation), and assist the Central Bank in operating the line of credit, as well as other
institutions involved in administering the laid-off worker retraining and SSE lending programs.
6.    The project followed two IDA-financed Structural Adjustment Credits (SAC II and III) that
had supported implementation of an adjustment program initiated in 1987 and 1988. This new
program, the Nouvelle Politique Industrielle (NPI), aimed to promote industrial exports, rationalize
the incentive system, and reduce rigidities in industrial and trade regulations.  It included
harmonization of the tariff structure and removal of quantitative restrictions. The project was
designed to help the industrial sector adjust to this new policy environment. Its objectives were
appropriate, but they were not all realistic, and some were too ambitious and risky, given the
institutional weaknesses in the implementing agencies.
7.    The APEX line of credit was designed on the basis of a study conducted in 1986-87 by the
Boston Consulting Group (BCG), a firm, which assessed the impact of policy reforms on the
industrial sector. It found that to become competitive, industrial enterprises had to rationalize their
operations and streamline their personnel and estimated that this objective would require US$33-49
million in long-term investment credit. As the local banks had been unable to provide longer-term
credit, IDA participation in supplying such financing through the APEX line of credit was
appropriate.
8.    The objective of providing worker retraining and credit financing for SSEs, while laudatory
was too ambitious and unrealistic, and the implementation steps to achieve it were not spelled out in
advance. The component to achieve this objective was designed on the basis of the BCG study,
which estimated that between 3,500 to 5,000 workers would lose their jobs due to industrial
enterprise restructuring. A recent report by the Groupe de Travail economique indicates that 10,000
workers were laid-off in the industrial sector between 1980 and 1990.
9.    The objective of providing TA to strengthen MDIA so it could effectively prepare and
implement industrial policy reforms, and to restructure ASACE and CICES, the institutions engaged
in export-promotion activities, was appropriate but risky, given the institutional weaknesses in the
Government and lack of borrower commitment.
C.   ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
10.   The Project was restructured twice, first, in October 1990  to allow the financing by
participating banks of feasibility studies as well as of working capital. The second restructuring, in



3
November 1995, after the CFA devaluation, was needed to modify the conditions of the Apex line of
credit, to cancel the components and activities that had no chance to succeed and reallocate the
undisbursed amount to the Apex line of credit which was progressively implemented, despite
numerous difficulties. Modifications are explained hereafter under each of the components.
11.   The APEX line of credit to provide financing to restr-_zture existing industrial enterprises
and viable new  investments was successfully implemented and the project objective was
substantially achieved, though only after two project restructuring. It took time for the commercial
banks to become familiar with the new and relatively complicated procedures for the use of the
credit line and to recognize its advantages in terms of the margin (a 4.5% spread) they would earn on
their sub-project loans and the fairly lengthy repayment period (up to 13 years, with a grace period
of 1-2 years). Besides, the foreign exchange risk was bome by the Government. As demand for
credit picked up with the improved economic conditions following the devaluation, the credit line
was disbursed quickly. The softening of the financial eligibility criteria for sub-project loans also
helped. Some 36 productive industrial enterprises were created, modernized, or expanded and they
have contributed substantially to industrial growth.
12.   Because of its extensive involvement in regulating the financial sector, the Central Bank was
assigned responsibility to administer the APEX line of credit and review the sub-projects submitted
by the participating banks. The review of sub-projects proved difficult to implement by the Central
Bank and raised concerns on the part of the participating banks. This arrangement could have
delayed approval of on lending for sub-projects, but IDA showed flexibility in implementation of the
on-lending procedures. It was therefore agreed that the commercial banks would transmit the project
documents directly to IDA, for review and approval, with copy to the Central Bank.
13.   The original US$25 million APEX line of credit was reduced to US$20.3 million after the
first project restructuring, but increased to US$30.9 million after the second restructuring, following
which the line of credit was disbursed rapidly. At least 25 sub-projects, out of the 40 total, were
financed during the project's last three years. One branch of the commercial bank SGBS (Societe
Gbnirale de Banque au Setnegal in Dakar), with its very able branch manager alone financed 28 of
the sub-projects, amounting to 72% of the APEX line of credit.
14.   Achievement of the objective for worker retraining and lending for SSEs was negligible.
The institutional mechanism to identify the laid-off industrial workers did not exist. Designing
appropriate vocational training and finding suitable jobs for the retrained workers proved difficult.
The BCG study estimated that about 4,000, or 16% of the formal manufacturing sector work force,
would be laid-off over time (the actual number exceeded 10,000). The project component to assist
these workers was designed to retrain 1,000 employees with a US$2 million budget. After retraining
about 300 workers with the help of ONFP (Organisation Nationale de Formation Professionelle), at
a cost of US$634,000, it proved virtually impossible to find appropriate jobs for the retrained
workers; only 10 retrained workers were known to have found jobs. The remaining budget for the
worker retraining sub-component was reallocated to the APEX line of credit after the second project
restructuring.
15.   The SSE lending program (US$3 million) was a failure as the participating banks did not
show any interest in extending loans to SSEs because (i) the sub-projects were poorly prepared; (ii)
their sponsors lacked business experience and collateral; and (iii) the administrative costs to process



4
small and risky loans were too high compared with the banks' other lending operations. This sub-
component's budget was also reallocated to the APEX line of credit.
16.   The TA/capacity building component (US$3 million) achieved its objective partially. In
1994, MDIA was split into two ministries: Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEMI) and Ministry of
Commerce, Industrialization, and Haridicrafts (MCAI) and only the TA for the latter achieved its
objective, as procurement problems prevented use of TA for strengthening MEMI. Even in the case
of MCAI, organizational changes in the ministry and delays, in the preparation of procurement
documents, studies, and consultant contracts, posed problems. In the absence of a realistic action
plan and timetable to restructure ASACE and CICES, these institutions did not use the TA. ASACE
was privatized in 1997; CICES continues to function at less than an optimal level.
D.   MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
17.   Factors subject to Government control. The lack of an institutional structure to assist laid-
off workers with retraining and the difficulties in obtaining financing to establish SSEs was because
the Government had not taken the steps to create effective institutions. It should have anticipated the
need for such institutions once it embarked on the NPI and began implementing reform programs.
As a result, the project component, which provided for retraining and financing of SSEs had little
success and it was canceled as there was little to show for the resources that had been used.
18.   The Government did not show much interest in or commitment to the restructuring of
ASACE and CICES, which could have helped to promote an expansion in exports and as well as the
capacity of the Senegalese industrial sector.
19.   Factors not subject to Government control. Senegal was afflicted with macroeconomic
imbalances and its economic difficulties had been intensified by the CFAF overvaluation, which was
corrected in January 1994. Before the devaluation it proved difficult to find investment sub-projects
that would be successful, so that both the approval and implementation of sub-projects were much
slower than anticipated. The four, non-performing, problem sub-projects had all been financed
before the devaluation. After the devaluation and restructuring of the project, the APEX line of
credit experienced a rapid rise in demand because economic conditions had improved. Confidence
returned to the financial markets and entrepreneurship was rewarded. All sub-projects financed after
the devaluation were successful and had no repayment problems.
20.   SOFISEDIT (Societt Financiere Sendgalaise pour le Developpement de l'Industrie et du
Tourisme--Development Bank for Industry and Tourism), which was to be a key participant in
disbursing the APEX line of credit, developed serious financial problems and was liquidated in
1989. Its demise contributed to a slowdown in credit disbursements for sub-projects. At the same
time, the commercial banks had little knowledge and experience in disbursing the APEX line of
credit or had done little to leam how to make use of it. IDA's strict financial and economic
eligibility criteria as well as the administrative requirements and procedures for the preparation of
sub-projects and loan applications were the cause of common complaints among the participating
commercial banks and potential entrepreneurs.

E.   SUSTAINABILITY
21.   The sub-projects financed with the APEX line of credit are repaying their debts and continue
to produce and export. Their contribution and success is promising for the development of the
private sector in the country and the project results are likely to be sustained. The banking system
has gained valuable experience through its technical input into the design and supervision of sub-
projects. The experience with the APEX line of credit, assessing the viability of sub-projects, and
enforcing the financial criteria have built up the confidence of commercial banks and they are better
equipped now to mobilize financial resources to invest in and promote private sector development.
F.  BANK PERFORMANCE
22.  Identification and Preparation.   The Bank's performance in the identification and
preparation of the project was satisfactory. The project was designed to support the NPI and the
ongoing structural reform programs. But, the BCG study, which provided the basis for the design
and size of several project components, was deficient in several respects, especially in its estimate of
the NPI's impact on the industrial sector labor force. A macroeconomic framework of the
Senegalese economy was missing and the studies, undertaken before project appraisal, had not
analyzed accurately the interest among potential participant banks to disburse the APEX line of
credit. An analysis of the demand for sub-project loans had also not been done. As was the practice
at the time, the process of identification was not altogether carried out in a participatory manner.
23.   AppraisaL  During appraisal, Senegal's macroeconomic conditions were difficult and the
environment for private sector investment was unfavorable. The impact of the NPI on the industrial
sector was not yet known. Bank staff were aware that the CFAF was overvalued, but the foreign
exchange risk and its impact on potential sub-projects were not properly assessed at appraisal. No
institutional mechanism was in place for retraining and finding appropriate jobs for laid-off workers
and no provision was made for coordination among the different project sub-components. As a
result, project implementation was almost at a standstill in the early years of the life of the project.
Bank staff performance during appraisal was marginally satisfactory.
24.   Supervision.  The Bank conducted 11 on-site supervision missions; the frequency of
supervision was more intensive after the devaluation because of an increased demand for sub-project
loans. Bank supervision was highly satisfactory. The missions properly identified the problems,
proposed appropriate remedies, and followed them up effectively. This was especially apparent in
their identification of obstacles to implementation before and after the devaluation. Bank staff
responded quickly in their analysis and approval of the sub-project loan applications. They showed
flexibility in altering the financial-eligibility criteria and sub-project loan limits and, in general, in
helping the Government to restructure the project twice.
G. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
25.   The Borrower's performance during project preparation was deficient. Although, the project
objectives were appropriate, some of the project components were complex and were not likely to be
implemented. The Borrower should have been able to recognize these difficulties, including its lack
of implementation tools and a weak institutional structure. This was especially true with respect to



6
the identification of laid-off workers and finding new employment for them and the lack of provision
for coordination among project components.
26.   Borrower performance during project implementation was satisfactory. After a slow start,
the pace of implementation picked up with the devaluation and improved macroeconomic
conditions. Demand for sub-project loans increased substantially and the Borrower contributed in
full measure to the restructuring of the project. The Borrower's performance in implementing the
TA component for MCAI was also satisfactory, although some problems were caused by frequent
staff changes. But what the Borrower needed to do, possibly with some donor assistance, was to
gather data on the performance of the industrial sub-projects financed through the APEX line of
credit and evaluate the successes and failures. It did not take the initiative to do this and thus missed
the opportunity to assess the economic and environmental impact of the industrialization process and
to identify supportive measures and policy regulations to promote future industrial growth.
27.   The Borrower, with a few exceptions in the early years, complied with the legal covenants of
the credit agreement and followed IDA procurement procedures. The credit audits were delivered in
a timely manner.
H.  ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
28.   The overall outcome of the project is rated satisfactory. Most of the sub-projects, 36 of the
40 financed through the APEX line of credit (accounting for 90% of the project costs), are
productive and repaying their debts regularly. Only four small sub-projects experienced repayment
problems, accounting for less than 2% of the APEX line of credit. The table below shows the
distribution of the APEX line of credit by industry sector, total investmnents, and credit arnounts
extended for sub-projects.

Note: As of 11/30198, CFAF 545=US$1.
29.   The APEX line of credit played an important catalytic role in stimulating additional
investments from commercial banks and the private sector for industry. Some 37 sub-projects
attracted investments of about US$66 million, of which US$27 million or 40% was from the APEX



7
line of credit. For reliable clients, the commercial banks began to lend more of their own medium-
and long-term resources than the amounts available from the APEX line of credit. For example; one
sub-project, SOSETRA, visited during the ICR preparation mission, was a new factory under
construction, which had obtained a loan from SGBS, of which only 25% of the loan was from APEX
line of credit. SOSETRA planned to employ the latest production technology to produce rod iron for
construction. It was intending to use scrap metal as raw material, which would help to clean the
environment by recycling waste.
30.  Implementation of other project components, retraining and credit for laid-off workers and
TA for ASACE and CICES, was either negligible or these components were canceled during project
restructuring. TA for MCAI was successful, but the TA for MEMI was not implemented because of
procurement problems.
31.   The successful experience with the APEX line of credit has increased the confidence of the
banking system and built up its capacity to evaluate proposals and provide credit for worthy
enterprises. It also encouraged banks to extend medium- and long-term credit to the industrial sector
from their own resources and through equity participation. The project has helped to sustain the
interest of the Government, the private banks, and individual entrepreneurs to look favorably on a
similar type of credit in the future.
1.    FUTURE OPERATIONS
32.   There has been numerous requests from the commercial banks as well as from the
Government to IDA for the financing of another similar project. Despite its remarkable success the
Project did not address the basic issues i.e. the absence of long term resources to finance investments
projects. Today, there still exists a shortage of resources to finance long term (private) investments
projects. IDA is commited to provide it support to the Government. The challenge for the Country
is to accelerate the pace of economic, financial and legal reforms to rapidly channel additional
me4ium and long term financial resources to productive investments. To assist the Government in
the widening and deepening of its reform program, IDA has provided financing for the Private
Sector Capacity Building Project (FY96) which finances studies on the constraints and opportunities
for private sector development in Senegal. These studies and those conducted by the MCAI on
industrial clusters under this project, will serve as key elements in the preparation of the forthcoming
Private Sector Development Project (FY00). Finally, a Financial Sector Assessment (FY00) will
provide information and recommendations and how to address the key problems in the financial
sector.
J.    KEY LESSONS LEARNED
33.   The key lessons learned from implementation of this project are:
(i)   Project objectives should be in harmony with the global business environment. One of the
first steps in the preparation of projects whose objective is to provide resources to finance productive
investment should be to ascertain that the macroeconomic conditions are favorable to private
investment. If the conditions are not favorable, project objectives should be modified to reflect the
need to create a favorable macroeconomic, legal, institutional environment before establishing any
financing scheme.



8
(ii)   All project objectives should be simple, realistic, and readily achievable, and when several
institutions are involved in project implementation, adequate mechanisms should be established to
ensure proper coordination between them. The project sub-components not implemented or
implemented unsatisfactorily dealt with the identification and training of laid-off workers, and
helping them find jobs or start new businesses. These sub-components, which represented a small
part of the project costs, were neither clearly identified nor well designed and the institLtional
structure for their implementation was lacking.
(iii) Both the supply and demand sides of "the products" offered by the project, as well the
interest of the intermediary institutions to deliver them should be carefully assessed during appraisal.
The SAR did not assess the demand side of APEX line of credit appropriately. The demand for
credit among the existing entrepreneurs was unknown and the willingness and ability of the
commercial banking system to disburse the APEX line of credit was also not known. Before
devaluation, the demand for credit was low. The softening of the sub-loan conditions after project
restructuring helped to increase demand and contributed to project success.
(iv)   When the design of a project includes intermediaries whose contribution is critical to the
success of the project (in this case, the commercial banks were he intermediaries between the
Government and the Beneficiaries), the project should provide strong incentives to theses
intermediaries. It is only after the devaluation, that the commercial banks discovered the advantages
of the attractive spread and repayment terms that the APEX line of credit offered, and they became
more familiar with IDA procedures and requirements.  They overcame the processing and
administrative difficulties in the preparation and application of sub-project loans. The attractive
credit loan incentives and the improved economic environment created a strong motivation among
the commercial banks as well as the private entrepreneurs to mobilize and invest medium-term
resources for productive investments.
(v)   To encourage industrial development, frequent consultation needs to be undertaken with the
private sector and its creative and practical suggestions considered seriously. The Government
should hold a continuing dialogue with the fiancial and industrial sectors to identify the remaining
constraints to industrial growth and take measures to eliminate them. Enterprises, for example, want
a simplification of administrative procedures, such as those dealing with customs duties, which lack
transparency and discourage them from importing products and creating new enterprises. They
should have also receive friendly, favorable, and non-discriminatory treatment from the authorities.

D. ICR MISSION'S AIDE-MEMOIRE
Le 27 juillet 1998
1.    Une mission de la Banque Mondiale composee de Messieurs Cherif Azi, Charge de Projet
Principal et Pierre Morin Specialiste senior des entreprises publiques a sejourne A Dakar du 13 au 22
juin 1998 afm (i) d'effectuer une derniere supervision du Projet de Restructuration du Secteur
Industriel (Cr.1868-SN), (ii) de recueillir les vues du Gouvemement, des agences d'exdcution et de
la Banque sur la mise en oeuvre du Projet; (iii) de fournir au Gouvernement les conseils et I'appui
n6cessaires a la preparation de sa contribution au rapport d'achevement. Mme Maimouna Savane qui
travaille A la Mission residente A Dakar a participd aux travaux de la mission.
I. ACHEVEMENT DU PROJET
2.    La mission a fait le point des activites A realiser d'ici le 30 juin 1998, date de cl6ture du
Projet. Elle a rappele au Gouvemement que seules les activites entierement realisees au 30 juin
1998 pourront faire l'objet d'un financement sous le credit. Dans cette optique, elle recommande au
Gouvernement de prendre les mesures afm que les etudes en cours et l'audit des comptes du projet
soient finalises avant la cloture et que les sous-projets d'investissement acceptes sous le projet soient
egalement finalises a cette date.
II. VUES DE L'EMPRUNTEUR ET DE LA BANQUE SUR LA MISE EN OEUVRE
DU PROJET
A. Objectifs du Projet
3.    Le Projet de Restructuration du Secteur Industriel avait pour objectif principal de faciliter
l'ajustement du secteur industriel au nouvel environnement economique resultant de I'adoption par
le Gouvernement d'une nouvelle politique industrielle. Plus precisement le proj et devait servir A (a)
financer la restructuration d'entreprises existantes et tout nouveau projet d'investissement jugd
viable; (b) appuyer les programmes d'assistance aux employes affectes par les reformes en vue de
reduire les effets negatifs des mesures de reformes; et (c) renforcer les institutions chargees de la
mise en oeuvre des reformes. Le projet avait trois composantes: (a) une ligne de credit de US$25
millions destinee A la restructuration d'entreprises existantes et au financement de nouveaux projets
d'investissements; (b) un programme de reconversion et de prets (US$5 millions) pour permettre aux
employes deflates de se reconvertir dans le secteur priv6 tout en leur fournissant des facilites de
financement; et, (c) l'assistance technique au Ministere de l'Industrie en vue de developper un cadre
institutionnel favorable A la promotion des exportations, renforcer sa capacite A mettre en oeuvre la
ligne de credit, le programme de reconversion et le programme de prets.
4.    Les composantes du projet etaient. clairement definies.  Elles etaient coherentes avec
l'objectif principal du projet et chacune visait un probleme sp6cifique: fmancement, probleme du
personnel deflate, promotion des exportations, assurance credit export, renforcement des capacit6s
institutionnelles de mise en oeuvre. Le projet comportait un risque tres 6leve aussi bien en ce qui
concerne l'offre que la demande de prets industriels. I1 n'6tait pas assure que le secteur bancaire etait



24
dispose A augmenter 1'encours de ses pr8ts au secteur industriel. II n'etait pas clair egalement que les
entreprises du secteur industriel etaient disposees A proceder a de nouveaux investissements dans un
contexte oui la question fondamentale de la competitivite n'etait toujours pas r6glee.
B. Realisation des Objectifs
5.    Jusqu'A la restructuration du projet, en fin 1995, le degre de realisation des objectifs de
chacune des composante ffit tres limite.
6.    Premiere Composante: Ligne de credit. Cette composante a atteint ses objectifs. Avant
1'aamendement de 1996, 19 sous-projets ont e  refmances. Depuis lors, la ligne de credit a ete
enti6rement engagee et sera probablement decaiss6e avant la date de cl6ture du projet. Elle aura
finance 38 sous-projets dont pratiquement aucun ne connalt de difficulte de repaiement. Les banques
participantes procedent aussi au repaiement du pret du Gouvemement sans aucun probleme.
7.    Seconde composante: Reconversion et ligne de credit au profit des employes deflates. Cette
composante n'a pas atteint ses objectifs et fat eliminee lors de la restructuration du projet en
decembre 1995. Le programme de formation des deflates pour faciliter leur reconversion a ete
partiellement mis en oeuvre par l'Office National de Formation Professionnelle (ONFP). Ce
programme n'a pratiquement pas enregistre de succes car tres peu des 300 employes formes par
l'ONFP ont reussi A se reconvertir et trouver un nouvel emploi. La ligne de credit au profit des
deflates n'a pas ete utilisee car aucune banque de la place n'a manifeste un inter8t pour financer des
projets inities par des deflates.
8.    La troisieme composante: Appui aux institutions comme l'ASACE, le CICES, l'ONFP et au
Ministere de l'Environnement. Cette composante n'a que tres partiellement atteint ses objectifs.
Parmi les activites initialement envisagees, seule I'assistance technique au Ministere de l'Energie,
des Mines et de l'Industrie (MEMI) a ete execut6e en financant des etudes qui ont permis
d'ameliorer la connaissance des problemes du secteur industriel et de preparer des reformes. ElUe a
aussi permis de prodiguer de la formation aux agents du MEMI et de pourvoir des equipements. Par
manque d'inter8t pour renforcer et privatiser l'Agence Senegalaise d'Assurance-Credit A
1'Exportation (ASACE) et a transferer au secteur prive les activites commerciales du Centre
International du Commerce exterieur du Senegal (CICES), ces activites n'ont m8me pas connu un
debut d'execution. De meme l'etude initialement envisagee pour renforcer la reglementation de
l'impact des activites industrielle a et abandonne quand le Gouvernement a entrepris, avec I'appui
de la Banque mondiale, une etude plus large -- la preparation d'un Plan National d'Evaluation de
l'environnement.  Lors de la restructuration du projet, cette composante a fait l'objet de
modifications profondes: la restructuration de L'ASACE et du CICES ont e  abandonnees et une
assistance fuit prevue renforcer les capacites de la Direction des Mines au MEMI et de la Direction
de l'Industrialisation au Ministere du Minist&e du Commerce, de l'Artisanat et de l'Industrialisation
(MCAI). Cette assistance n'a pas pu totalement atteindre ses objectifs a cause de retards dans
1'execution des etudes et contrats de consultant.
9.    En resume, le projet a pleinement atteint les objectifs de la ligne Apex (qui representait en
valeur plus de 90% du credit IDA) en mettant a la disposition des banques primaires les ressources
qui ont permis de financer des sous-projets d'investissement dont l'objectif etait de "faciliter



25
I'ajustement du secteur industriel a la nouvelle politique industrielle". La partie assistance du projet
n'a pas atteint ses objectifs.
C. Facteurs Ayant AffectW I'Exkcution du Projet
10.   L'execution du projet  s'est caracterisee par une extreme lenteur jusqu'A ce qu'il soit
restructure en fin 1996. La SOFISEDIT qui etait l'institution financibre supposee etre la plus a
m8me d'utiliser la ligne APEX a connu des difficultes financieres qui ont mene A sa liquidation vers
1989. Les autres banques eligibles se plaignaient de la lourdeur et de la complexite des procedures
d'acces A la ligne de cr6dit. Les criteres d'eligibilite etaient egalement pergus comme etant un
obstacle A l'utilisation de la ligne de credit par les emprunteurs potentiels. En outre, jusqu'en 1994
quand la devaluation du Franc CFA eu lieu et quand le Gouvernement commenca a appliquer des
mesures d'ajustement rigoureuse, la situation economique n'etait pas favorable a l'investissement: la
situation macro-economique 6tait precaire et la sur6valuation du CFA rendait les entreprises
senegalaises peu competitives.
11.   La composante "reconversion des employes deflates" a connu de serieuses difficultes de mise
en oeuvre. En effet, au depart l'ONFP n'a pu identifier les personnes licenciees par les entreprises
pour leur prodiguer de la formation en vue de leur reconversion. En outre, aucun mecanisme n'a pu
etre mis en place pour aider les deflates formes par l'ONFP pour retrouver un emploi. Le resultat a
etd que ceux de deflates fornes par l'ONFP n'ont pu etre retrouves pour savoir s'ils avaient retrouv6
un emploi ou non. De plus, aucun d'eux n'a pu avoir acces aux fonds disponibles pour le
financement d'une petite entreprise qu'ils pourraient etablir car aucune des banques de la place n'a
voulu prendre le risque de les financer. Cette composante fut donc abandonnee tout comme l'appui
A l'Office National de Formation Professionnelle.
12.   Les institutions d'appui aux operateurs economiques ASACE, CICES de meme que le
Ministere de l'Environnement n'ont pas demontre un intbret reel A utiliser le financement disponible
sous le projet afin de mettre en oeuvre leur programme de reforme.
13.   Sur la base de ces constats, la Banque et le Gouvemement deciderent, en 1995, de reorienter
le projet. Les composantes jugees non operationnelles furent eliminees. Seules la composante ligne
de credit et la composante appui au MEMI et celle relative A l'appui au MCAI furent maintenues.
Les procedures d'acces A la ligne de credit furent modifides pour, entre autres, assouplir les criteres
d'eligibilite des projets, simplifier le dossier d'evaluation des projets que les banques participantes
devaient constituer et augmenter le plafond de financement soumis A autorisation prealable de l'IDA
et le montant maximum des prets que les banques pouvaient consentir. Ces modifications ont
entraine une augmentation substantielle des demandes de financement de sorte qu'au cours de ces
deux dernieres annees le nombre de sous-projets finances a ete egal au nombre de sous-projets
finances au cours des huits premieres annees du projet et que la ligne de credit a ete totalement
engagee.
14.   Suite A l'amendement de l'Accord de Credit, I'appui au MEMI comportait une assistance
financiere A la Direction des Mines et de la Geologie. Cet appui n'a pu se materialiser en raison
d'erreurs faites dans le processus d'evaluation des d'offres recues par la Direction de la Geologie et
des Mines pour la fourniture de services de consultants et la fourniture d'equipements. A la suite de
ces erreurs, il ne restait plus suffisamment de temps pour finaliser correctement la procedures de



26
passation de ce marche et terminer le travail des consultants avant la date de cl6ture du projet. Cette
activite a donc ete abandonnee. Quant A l'appui au MCAI, il s'est execute A peu pres selon le plan
d'operation etabli lors de I'amendement du projet.
D. Perennite des Reformes Entreprises Dans le Cadre du Projet
15.   L'adoption et la mise en oeuvre de reformes ne faisaient pas partie des objectifs d'aucune des
composantes du projet.
E. Performance de la Banque
16.   La performance de la Banque lors de l'identification du projet a ete satisfaisante. le projet
venait en appui A la mise en oeuvre de la Nouvelle Politique Industrielle (NPI) du Gouvernement du
Senegal. L'assistance fournie au Gouvemement lors de la preparation du projet a aussi ete moins
satisfaisante. Elle a consiste en un certain nombre d' etudes de consultants sur les effets previsibles
de la NPI (menees par Boston Consulting Group). Cependant ces etudes bas6es sur des interview
d'entreprises seulement n'analyserent pas suffisamment le contexte macro-economique du Senegal
qui 6tait pourtant fragile et inadequat pour le succes de la NPI. Si cela avait et6 fait, cela aurait peut-
.tre pu permettre de prevoir que la ligne de credit APEX ne connaitrait pas un grand succes et que le
programme d'assistance aux deflates connaltrait de graves difficultes de mise en oeuvre. Compte
tenu de la faible capacit6 de mise en oeuvre des projets qui existait A l'epoque, la Banque aurait dui
attirer I'attention du Gouvernement sur le fait que la coordination et le suivi du projet devaient faire
l'objet d'une attention particuliere surtout A son debut du projet. Egalement, la Banque n'avait pas
pleinement identifie les risques eventuels qui pourraient entraver la bonne execution du projet. La
performance de la Banque lors de la supervision du projet a ete satisfaisante et a pernis d'identifier
les obstacles A la mise en oeuvre du projet et d'apporter des solutions idoines lors de l'amendement
de l'Accord de Credit..
F. Performance de I'Emprunteur
17.   La performance de l'Emprunteur lors de la preparation du projet a ete moins que
satisfaisante. En effet, bien que l'objectif du projet etait tout A fait valable, les composantes avaient
une tres grande envergure et, comme l'ont revele les difficultes de mise en oeuvre et l'amendement
rendu obligatoire, elles etaient inadaptees au contexte de l'epoque. L'execution des composantes a
e  rendue complexe  en raison des procedures et criteres d'exigibilite. La performance de
l'emprunteur lors de la mise en oeuvre du projet a dt6 satisfaisante notamment en ce qui concerne la
ligne de credit et I'assistance au MCAI. Le MEMI aurait pu retirer de plus grands benefices du projet
s'il avait rigoureusement suivi les regles de passation de marche. La performance du Gouvernement
a egalement ete satisfaisante lors de l'amendement de l'Accord de Credit.
G. Evaluation des Resultats
18.   Apres un lent depart, la composante ligne de credit a connu un grand succes A partir de 1994
quand les difficultes mentionnees plus haut ont et levees et surtout quand le FCFA fut devalue et
que le gouvemement ait entrepris des reformes structurelles profondes (abolition des monopoles,
liberalisation des prix et du commerce etc..). les banques eligibles ont pu refinancer 36 sous-projets
dont aucun ne connait de difficulte de repaiement. L'6valuation d6taillee des resultats en termes en



27
termes d'investissement direct, de creation d'emplois, etc. se poursuivra lors de l'elaboration du
Rapport d'Achevement du Proj et.
19.   L'appui aux deflates a connu des resultats negligeables. Tel que mentionne precedemment,
les difficultes de mise en oeuvre ont conduit a l'elimination de cette composante.
20.   L'appui au MEMI a eu des resultats qui se situent en deca des attentes que l'on avait au
moment de la modification de l'Accord de Credit. En fait, les activites les plus importantes
envisagees lors de la modification n'ont pas ete executees comme, par exemple, l'assistance A la
Direction des Mines et de la Geologie. L'appui au MCAI a, par contre, atteint les resultats vises.
Depuis 1996 le projet a finance des 6tudes qui permettront au MCAI d'orienter son action pour la
mise en oeuvre avec le secteur prive d'une strategie de developpement par grappes. Des actions plus
specifiques sont envisagees pour le secteur des produits d'emballage et le secteur electromecanique.
H. Principales Lecons
21.   Comme mentionne precedemment, le projet n'a pu etre mis en oeuvre que lorsque des
reformes structurelles ont e  entreprises et que le projet lui meme fut simplifie. Une premiere le9on
est donc qu'un projet sectorielle n'a de chances de reussir que lorsque l'environnement macro-
economique et reglementaire est sain. Une autre lecons est que dans un pays dont les capacit6s de
mise en oeuvre de projets de developpement sont limitees, comme c'etait le cas pour le Senegal a
l'epoque oui le projet fut prepare, il est essentiel de viser des objectifs simples et de les assigner a des
composantes de conception egalement simple et pratique. Dans cette optique, la definition des
composantes necessite une bonne connaissance des besoins des beneficiaires cibles et des contraintes
de l'environnement. Il est donc indispensable, lors de la preparation de projets, de chercher A tester
le contenu des composantes aupres des beneficiaires afm de s'assurer qu'elles correspondent a des
besoins reels permettant d'apporter une solution a des problemes importants.

E. BORROWER CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
I. INTRODUCTION
Dans le contexte d'une politique de reforme, pour un developpement economique soutenu et
durable, et financierement stable, initiee depuis 1980, appuyee par le FMI et la Banque Mondiale, un
important programme d'ajustement du secteur industriel devait etre mis en ceuvre.
Le secteur industriel, caracterise par un haut niveau de protection de son marche interieur,
une reglementation inefficiente, et des procddures administratives lourdes, demeurait stagnant depuis
l'independance, et sa competitivit6 sur le marche international ne faisait que se deteriorer.
Une nouvelle politique industrielle devenait incontournable, et les principaux axes d6finis
visaient: la suppression des restrictions quantitatives des importations, 1'harmonisation de la
structure des tarifs, la mise en place d'un regime commun pour le commerce, la liberation du droit
du travail et des prix.
Dans la mise en xuvre de cette politique, entre autres mesures d'accompagnement, il fallait
mettre en place des facilites pour permettre aux entreprises de se restructurer et d' absorber le choc de
la deprotection.
C'est dans ce cadre que le gouvernement a sollicite et obtenu un appui de la Banque
Mondiale a travers un Accord de Cr6dit portant Projet de Restructuration du Secteur Industriel
(credit 1868-SE) d'un montant de 25 millions de DTS.
IL. OBJECTIFS DU PROJET
Le Projet de Restructuration du Secteur Industriel avait pour objectif principal de faciliter
l'ajustement du secteur industriel au nouvel environnement economique resultant de l'adoption par
le Gouvernement d'une nouvelle politique industrielle (NPI). Plus precisement, le projet devait:
1. Faciliter l'ajustement des entreprises du secteur industriel au nouvel environnement;
2. Appuyer des programmes d'assistance en faveur des employes affectes par les reformes en
vue de reduire les effets negatifs des mesures prises;
3. Renforcer les institutions chargees de la mise en ceuvre de ces reformes.
III. LES COMPOSANTES DU PROJET
En application des dispositions de l'accord prdcit6, le proj et devait s'executer a travers trois
composantes.



29
1) LIGNE DE CREDIT
Une ligne de credit destinee au fmancement de la restructuration d'entreprises existantes et au
financement de nouveaux projets d'investissement , a ete mise en place aux conditions ci - apres:
-  duree  :13 ans;
-  differe 2 ans
-  Taux d'interet: 9,5 % au moment oui les banques appliquaient en 1989 un taux d'interet de 19%
Initialement fixee A un montant de 18,9 millions de DTS, apres plusieurs reallocations de
fonds, la ligne de credit s'est elevee a 23,235 millions de DTS.
A cet effet, le rOle devolu A la Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO)
concemait, pour l'essentiel, la gestion dans ses livres, de deux comptes et la participation
reguliere aux travaux du Comite de suivi de l'execution du projet.
Les comptes ouverts ont ete les suivants:
- Un compte special APEX, destine a abriter les avances de fonds de la Banque Mondiale. Ce
compte a recu une premibre dotation de 250 millions F CFA correspondant A son plafond initial
porte par la suite A 500 millions en Mars 1991, puis A 1 milliard en Decembre 1996, afin de tenir
compte de la nature et de l'importance des projets approuves par les banques participantes.
Les decaissements au profit des projets agrees devaient s'effectuer sur la base de dossiers
presentes par les banques et comprenant notamment:
>  Une demande de remboursement;
>  Le contrat d'ouverture de credit conclu entre la banque participante et le proj et d'investissement
(entreprise) concerne;
> Le tableau d'amortissement du pret;
>  Les factures accompagnees des copies des supports de reglement utilises par 1'entreprise pour
assurer le paiement du foumisseur (cheques, bons de virement, avis de d6bit etc).
- Un compte de remboursement destine A recevoir les remboursements de fonds operes par les
entreprises beneficiaires de financements sur la ligne de credit APEX.
La ligne de credit a servi A financer 41 sous-projets pour un montant equivalent A 15 149 millions
de F CFA repartis ainsi qu'il suit:



30
Investissement     (38)                            15 112 M
Fonds de roulement  (1)                               30 M
Etude               (2)                                 7 M
Les decaissements effectues s'elevent pour leur part, a la somme de 13.977,5 millions F
CFA dont 9.877,5 millions F CFA au titre du compte special et 4.100 millions F CFA suivant la
procedure de paiement direct en faveur de quatre (4) sous-projets (SHELL, ELF OIL, SOSETRA et
SIPS) sont retraces en annexe.
Globalement, les remboursements s'operent de maniere tout a fait satisfaisante,
conformement aux modalites de remboursement conclues entre les banques participantes et les
entreprises d'investissement.
II convient cependant de signaler que des incidents ont et enregistres au niveau de trois
sous-projets:
SHYDRAPA
Selon les informations recueillies aupres de la S.G.B.S, ce sous-projet connailtrait des
problemes de fonds de roulement qui expliqueraient les incidents constates. La banque participante a
dte amenee a rembourser les echeances dues en lieu et place du client defaillant conformement aux
dispositions de la lettre circulaire.
AFRIGEL
Ce sous-projet n'a jusqu'ici effectu6 aucun paiement au titre des avances qui lui ont ete
consenties. Cette situation s'explique principalement par les difficultes financieres rencontrees par la
banque participante concern6e (BST) et par le changement intervenu au niveau de la Direction de cet
etablissement.
La Banque Centrale a invite la BST a proceder dans les meilleurs delais aux regularisations
des echeances dues.
DIMES
Le credit accorde a cette entreprise a connu au debut un denouement normal.
Toutefois, les dernieres echeances de remboursement n'ont pas ete respectees par la societe
qui serait en contentieux selon la BICIS. La banque a et invitee en consequence a regulariser la
situation dans les meilleurs d6lais et a payer pour le compte de son client defaillant, conformement
aux dispositions en vigueur.

Les remboursements ont totalise un montant de 5 430,7 millions de F CFA. La situation
detaille des remboursements par sous projet est retracee dans l'annexe II.
2. PROGRAMME DE RECONVERSION ET DE PRETS AUX DEFLATES
Afm d'attenuer les effets negatifs sur l'emploi du fait de la restructuration des entreprises
industrielles, il etait prevu la formation des employes qui seraient deflates pour leur permettre de se
reinserer A travers des projets qu'ils auraient A realiser sur financement d'un credit specifique prevu A
cet effet dans le cadre du Projet.
De l'execution de ce volet, il ressort:
- La population initialement ciblee etait de 1 000 deflates sur les 5 000 qui devaient perdre leurs
emplois, selon les previsions, du fait de la restructuration du secteur industriel. Cet effectif devait
par la suite 8tre ramene A 500 car les charges recurrentes n'avaient pas ete tenues en compte dans
le budget previsionnel arr8te A 1500 000 DTS.
-  L'Office National de Formation Professionnelle(ONFP) charge de la mise en ceuvre de cette
composante a pu former 302 deflates du secteur industriel au moment de l'arret de ce volet en
1994 du fait principalement de la non-execution du volet financement des activites pour la
reconversion des deflates, pour un cofit de 253 137 DTS soit 17% des credits alloues.
-  Le volet formation a et arrete au 31/12/94 soit 3 ans avant le terme prevu.
La mise en ceuvre de ce volet a permis d'avoir une meilleure connaissance de la population ciblee et
de disposer des informations fiables et credibles sur elle
2) APPUI INSTITUTIONNEL
Dans cette composante, il etait prevu, la reorganisation d'institutions de promotion des
exportations, A savoir l'Agence Senegalaise d'Assurance Credit A l'exportation(ASACE)et le Centre
International du Commerce Exterieur du Senegal(CICES), le renforcement des capacites de mise en
aeuvre du Projet et 1'ex6cution d'etudes devant faciliter I'ajustement du secteur industriel.
Concernant le volet reorganisation des institutions de promotion des exportations, il s'est avere
ulterieurement que les causes reelles du manque de performances de ces institutions n'etaient pas
liees A une organisation non appropriee ou A des problemes de management.
Des lors, il n'etait plus utile de voir le Projet poursuivre cette activite.
Les programmes de reforme de politiques sectorielles (mines et environnement) devant faciliter
I'ajustement du secteur industriel n'ont pas connu d'execution.

IV. FACTEURS AYANT AFFECTE L'EXECUTION DU PROJET
Les composantes du Projet etaient clairement definies. Elles etaient coherentes avec l'objectif
principal du Projet et chacune visait un probleme specifique: financement, reinsertion du personnel
deflate, promotion des exportations, assurance credit export, renforcement des capacites
institutionnelles de mise en cruvre.
Cependant le Projet comportait un risque tres eleve aussi bien en ce qui conceme l'offre que
la demande de prets industriels. II n'etait pas assure que le secteur bancaire etait dispose A augmenter
l'encours de ses prets au secteur industriel. II n'etait pas clairement etabli que les entreprises du
secteur industriel etaient disposees A proceder A de nouveaux investissements dans un contexte ou
persistaient encore des problemes de competitivite.
C'est pourquoi, l'execution du Projet s'est d'abord deroulee avec une tres grande lenteur qui
a necessite par la suite sa restructuration. En effet, la lourdeur et la complexit6 des procedures
d'acces A la ligne de credit ont eu pour consequence que tres peu de prets furent consentis entre 1988
et 1995. Les criteres d'eligibilite etaient egalement percus comme etant un obstacle majeur A
l'utilisation de la ligne de cr6dit par les emprunteurs potentiels. Les difficult6s financieres de la
SOFISEDIT, seule institution financikre habilitee A refinancer des pr6ts commerciaux sous le
credit, ont egalement eu pour effet de ralentir la mise en ceuvre du Projet.
De plus, les criteres d'appreciation des dossiers etaient relativement difficiles d'application et
les plafonds des avances de fonds pour le r6approvisionnement du compte special furent juges trop
bas. Enfin, la qualite exigee des emprunteurs, de leurs projets, de l'ensemble du dossier et les
garanties sollicitees rendaient difficile l'utilisation de la ligne de credit.
C'est ainsi que les difficultes rencontr6es dans le domaine purement financier ont ete situes A
deux niveaux:
1) Au niveau des proc6dures de financement
Le montant du plafond initialement fixe pour le compte d'avance A 250 millions cfa fut
porter ensuite A 500 millions F CFA et fmalement A 1.000 millions F CFA eu egard A la nature et au
volume des projets agrees.
Par ailleurs, les procedures de refinancement sont complexes et font intervenir plusieurs
structures (BCEAO, Direction de la Dette et de l'Investissement (D.D.I), Mission Residente et Siege
de la Banque Mondiale).
En consequence, les delais de realisation des operations se sont averes relativement longs,
reduisant F'efficacite du dispositif mis en place.
2) Au niveau des relations avec les banques participantes



33
Les dossiers relatifs aux demandes de deblocage presentees par les banques participantes sont
souvent incomplets. Ils comportent generalement des factures proforma et ou/ ne sont pas toujours
accompagnes des justificatifs appropries (copies de cheques, bons de virement ou avis de debit, etc.).
Par ailleurs, les demandes sont souvent presentees au moment ou les investissements ne sont
pas encore realises ou sont executes partiellement.
Au total, il apparait ainsi que les difficultes rencontrees dans la gestion de la ligne de credit
APEX sont dues, pour l'essentiel au fait que les dispositions regissant les modalit6s de
fonctionnement de la ligne, notamment celles ayant trait aux procedures de refinancement ne sont
pas toujours clairement percues par les banques participantes, ce qui semble expliquer la faible
implication de certaines d'entre elles.
Pour celles qui, apparemment maitrisent bien les mecanismes de fonctionnement de la ligne
APEX, les difficultes pourraient s'expliquer par des contraintes propres aux entreprises financees.
La composante reconversion des deflates a connu de serieuses difficultes de mise en aeuvre.
En effet, les utilisateurs potentiels, les deflat6s du secteur prive,
n'ont pas pu acceder aux fonds disponibles pour le financement de leurs activites de
reconversion, non seulement du fait que les banques ne voulaient pas financer une multitude de
micros projets avec des couts recurrents eleves de gestion de dossiers, mais surtout en raison de
l'impossibilite pour les promoteurs de pouvoir satisfaire la condition preliminaire A savoir degager
un apport personnel.
Des lors, la composante fut abandonnee tout comme celle relative A l'appui A l'ONFP.
Les institutions d'appui aux operateurs economiques ASACE, CICES, n'ont marque aucun
interet reel a utiliser le financement disponible afin de mettre en ceuvre leur programme de reforme
tel que defini dans le Proj et.
De meme, le Ministere charge de l'Environnement n'a pas apporte la diligence necessaire
pour utiliser les credits qui lui etaient reserves.
Sur la base de ces constats, la Banque Mondiale et le Gouvemement du Senegal d6ciderent
en 1995 de reorienter le Projet. Les composantes jugees non operationnelles furent annulees. Seules
la composante ligne de credit et celle relative A l'appui institutionnel au MEMI et au MCAI furent
maintenues. Les proc6dures d'acces A la ligne de credit furent modifiees pour, entre autres, assouplir
les criteres d'eligibilite de l'emprunteur, les criteres d'evaluation des projets et relever les plafonds
des avances de fonds(plafond du compte special) et le montant maximal des prets. Ces modifications
ont permis une explosion)> des demandes de refinancement de sorte qu'au cours des deux dernieres
annees, une trentaine de projets ont ete finances sur la ligne de credit.



34
Par ailleurs, suite aux modifications de l'Accord de Credit, I'appui au MEMI comportait une
assistance financibre a la Direction des Mines et de la Geologie qui n'a pu se materialiser en raison
des difficultes survenues dans le processus d'appel d'offres pour des services professionnels et la
fourniture d'equipement, ne laissant plus suffisamment de temps permettant de realiser l'ensemble
des actions envisagees avant la date de cl6ture.
L'appui au MCAI s'est deroule a peu prbs selon le plan etabli.
II faut par ailleurs noter que la devaluation du franc CFA intervenue en 1994 a positivement
influence l'execution du Projet en permettant la mobilisation de credits trbs substantiels du fait des
cours de changes favorables(DTS/F.CFA).
V. L'EXPERIENCE TIREE DE LA M1SE EN CEUVRE DU PROJET
La Nouvelle Politique Industrielle adoptee en 1986, necessitait la prise de mesures
d'accompagnement appropri6es. Le Projet de Restructuration du Secteur Industriel s'inscrivait dans
cette dynamique. Il a et6 elabore pour tirer le meilleur parti d'un changement d'environnement
*conomique et s'integrait parfaitement dans le cadre de la strategie d'ajustement global de
l'economie adoptee par le Gouvemement.
La mise en ceuvre du Projet a permis de mieux percevoir les facteurs qui entravent
l'expansion du credit pour le financement des entreprises en general, celles du secteur industriel en
particulier.
Ces entraves sont multiples et complexes. En plus des regles prudentielles de la Banque
Centrale de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO), il faut surtout retenir l'environnement economique des
entreprises, les mecanismes de formation de l'offre de credit, la nature de la demande et la qualite
du beneficiaire.
L'analyse de cette situation, a permis d'identifier les evolutions necessaires au
developpement du systeme financier, pour une meilleure allocation des ressources disponibles sur le
marche financier national, a l'amelioration de l'environnement de l'investissement et du dispositif
d'appui institutionnel aux operateurs economiques.
L'intervention de l'ONFP a permis une meilleure connaissance de la population ciblee, de
disposer d'informations fiables et cr6dibles sur elle, d'elaborer des documents de projet pour les
deflates pris individuellement ou collectivement, de mettre en place un dispositif performant de
formation constitue de structures de formation publique ou privee sur l'ensemble du territoire
national, d'acquerir une experience veritable dans la formation des deflates et de contribuer plus ou
moins a leur insertion dans le tissu economique productif.
VI. LA PERFORMANCE DE LA BANQUE MONDIALE ET DU GOUVERNEMENT DU
SENEGAL
La performance de la Banque lors de l'identification du Projet a ete tres appreciable.



35
Le Projet venait en appui A la mise en ceuvre de la Nouvelle Politique Industrielle du
Gouvernement du S6negal. L'assistance fournie au Gouvernement lors de la prbparation du Projet a
ete moins satisfaisante. En effet, une evaluation minutieuse des diverses composantes au moyen
notamment d'enquetes aupres des institutions bancaires et des emprunteurs eventuels auraient tres
certainement permis de prevoir que la ligne de credit ne serait pas mobilisable facilement et que le
programme de financement de la reinsertion des d6flates connaltrait de graves difficultes de mise en
ceuvre.
Compte tenu de la faible capacite de mise en ccuvre des projets a l'epoque et, de l'autonomie
de gestion de chacune des composantes du Projet, la Banque Mondiale aurait
du percevoir que la coordination et le suivi du Projet devaient faire l'objet d'une attention toute
particuliere. Les tentatives de reorientation qui ont ete initiees n'ont pas atteint les ameliorations
escomptees. La coordination a ete beaucoup plus budgetaire et financiere.
Par ailleurs, la Banque n'a pas suffisamment identifie les risques du Projet. Toutefois, la
performance de la Banque lors des missions de supervision a permnis de rnieux apprecier les
obstacles a une bonne execution du Projet et,. en relation avec les differents acteurs concernes, de
rechercher les solutions les plus appropriees.
La performance de l'Emprunteur lors de la preparation du Projet n'a pas ete satisfaisante. En
effet, bien que les objectifs du Projet aient e tout a fait valables, les composantes avaient une tres
grande envergure et, comme l'ont revele par la suite les difficultes de mise en ceuvre et la
restructuration rendue obligatoire, elles etaient definies de maniere trop complexe et ne
correspondaient pas aux besoins reels.
La performance de l'Emprunteur lors de l'ex6cution du Projet a ete satisfaisante notamment
en ce qui concerne la ligne de credit, la formation des d6flates et l'assistance au MCAI.
Le MEMI aurait pu tirer de plus grands benefices, si des difficultes majeures n'etaient pas
survenues dans la procedure de selection des prestataires de service dans le cadre de l'appui
institutionnel A la Direction des Mines et de la Geologie de ce departement.
La performance de l'Emprunteur a ete globalement satisfaisante suite a de la restructuration
du Proj et.
VII. LES LECONS TIREES DE L'EXECUTION DU PROJET
Dans un pays qui eprouve des difficultes dans la mise en aeuvre de projet de developpement,
comme c'etait le cas pour le Senegal A l'epoque odi le Projet fut prepare, il est essentiel de viser des
objectifs simples et de les articuler par des composantes egalement de conception simple et pratique.



36
Dans cette optique, la definition des composantes necessite une bonne connaissance des
besoins des beneficiaires cibles et des contraintes de l'environnement. II etait donc indispensable,
lors de la preparation du Projet de chercher A tester le contenu des composantes aupres des
beneficiaires afin de s'assurer qu'elles correspondaient a des besoins reels et que les solutions
envisagees etaient les bonnes.
Un projet qui implique plusieurs intervenants doit faire l'objet d'une bonne coordination non
seulement budg6taire mais aussi operationnelle. En l'absence d'un mecanisme assurant la
coordination operationnelle et le suivi de chacune des composantes, les difficultes de mise en ceuvre
passent inaper,ues jusqu'au jour oiu l'on constate que les activites prevues ne sont pas executees de
fa9on satisfaisante. Sans aller jusqu'a affirmer que le Projet aurait d(i etre place sous une unite de
gestion, un mecanisme souple de coordination aurait dei etre mis en place au sein de
I'Administration.
