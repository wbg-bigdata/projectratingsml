PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENTPRJC
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:                 Rwandese Republic
Beneficiaries:            Central Bank of Rwanda (BNR), Participating Financial Intermediaries
(PFIs), private enterprises, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the
Ministry of Justice's Tribunal of Commerce.
:m :                      SDR 8.7 million (US$12 million equivalent).
Terms:                    Standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity.
Objective:                The project's objective is to promote the rapid expansion of the private
sector as the key element in a development strategy for growth and
diversification. The specific components will provide the private sector
with both the incentives and the means to engage in labor-intensive,
export-oriented activities in an environment where local and foreign
entrepreneurs can operate within a free market economy.
Onlending Terms:          The project consists of a line of credit for productive investments, a fund
to improve technical and managerial capabilities and competitiveness of
the private sector, and support to institutions responsible for
implementing improvements in the business environment.
(i) Line of Credit. The Borrower would lend US$7 million equivalent
to BNR at a variable interest rate equal to the average yield over three
months of one-year commercial bank deposits, minus an anmnl
administrative fee, set at 1 percent, which is expected to cover
adequately BNR's operating costs under the credit component. The
credit to the Central Bank would be for 20 yeas, including a grace
period of 5 years. The Central Bank would onlend the funds to qualified
PFIs at the aforementioned one-year deposit rate, with the same
maturities as the individual subloans to the beneficiaries. Onlending
interest rates charged by PFIs to subborrowers would be variable and
determined by the banks. The onlending rates would be reviewed
periodically to ensure that they continue to reflect market rates. The
foreign exchange risk would be borne by the Government.
(ii) Private Sector SuDnrt Fund. US$2.5 million will be passed on to
the fund to: (a) help finance private firms' use of management
consultants; (b) organize specialized training seminars; and (c) cover
operational costs, including monitoring and follow-up of the assistance
to firms. The fund would be located in a commercial bank approved by
IDA and have an independent management.



il
(iii)    :_aUtmdgnaUwmgihinlng. USS2 million to be passed on to the
Implent  instuon for their strengthening. Beneficiaries would
be: (a) the Cal Bank and banks to implement staff training and
capacitY building programs, and to improve program related aspects of
banking supvision, economic and monetary analyses as well as credit
evaluation; (b) the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to implement the
private sector development strategy; and (c) the future Tribunal of
Commerce for the purpose of staff training and office equipment and
technology to ensure it is efficient and speedy in processing business
litigation.
efitsnd. RIa:             Mhe major expected benefits would stem from a supply response to
ongoing structumal  ustmet reforms. Improving the competitiveness
of extn   firm  and encouraging new local and foreign private
invstme  would contribute to attaining Rwanda's growth objectives.
Rapid response by private sector investors, encouraged by improved
business conditions, would create the employment opportunities that are
critical for the success of adjustment. The process of revamping the
regulatory framework, and the implementation of fiscal and labor policy
reforms may be delayed during the political transition, thereby slowing
ivestments. The consensus already built within the Government around
the need for effective reform of the business environment and the strong
voice of a rapidly emerging private sector should minimize this risk and
ensure the effective Implementation of the project.

RWANDESE REPUBLIC
PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1          Backgndn. Rwanda is a small landlocked country in Central Africa, covering some
26,000 square kilometers. Its annual per capita GDP is about US$250 (1992). With a population of
about 7.8 million growing at about 3.0 percent per annum, Rwanda has the highest population density
in Africa (295 persons/square kilometer). More than 90 percent of the population lives in rural areas,
and the economy depends on agriculture for 40 percent of GDP and 90 percent of employment and export
earnings. Coffee and tea account for about 80 percent of total exports. Industry, including mining,
represents only 14 percent of GDP and 6 percent of exports. Ethnic rivalry has been a major feature of
Rwanda's political history and it escalated into military conflict in October 1990. A peace accord was
signed on August 4, 1993 including an agreement, which includes the integration of representatives of
all rival groups into the Government. This pact will strengthen the process of political liberalization,
underway since early 1992.
1.2          From 1970 to the mid-1980s, Rwanda enjoyed low inflation and sustained growth
(averaging about 4 percent per annum). Since 1987, GDP has stagnated or declined, primarily because
of low coffee prices and poor weather. The initial policy response to this adverse economic situation was
inappropriate and relied on increased controls. Recognizing the need to revitalize the economy, the
Government began implementing a comprehensive Structural Adjustment Program in late 1990. This
program is supported by an IMF Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) and an IDA Structural Adjustment
Credit (SAC, Cr.2271-RW), approved in June 1991. Its goals are to achieve macroeconomic
stabilization, enhance the competitiveness of the economy, improve the allocation of resources, and
stimulate economic recovery. At the same time the Government started a program of restructuring the
parastatal sector and disengaging from productive and commercial activities, with the support of the
Public Enterprise Reform Credit (Cr.2113-RW, effective since February 1991). A summary review of
progress to date and the division of labor in support of policy reform by various Bank-supported projects
is given in the policy matrix (Annex 2).
1.3          Recent Adjustment Efforts and Bank Group Strategy. The most important measures taken
to date under the SAC include: (a) a cumulative devaluation of 61 percent in foreign currency terms since
mid-1990, opening up the trade regime by reducing tariff protection (decreasing the top rate from 220
to 100 percent), adopting a market-determined foreign exchange allocation for imports, and eliminating
all import prohibitions and export taxes, except on coffee; (b) setting targets for the reduction of the fiscal
deficit and limits on domestic credit expansion while implementing revenue enhancing measures; (c)
simplifying the interest rate structure and ensuring that key rates remain positive in real terms (the only
two rates that remain fixed are the minimum rate for savings deposits of 9 percent and the maximum rate
for lending of 16 percent, above the estimated inflation of 8 percent in 1992); (d) liberalizing prices of
industrial goods, and raising petroleum prices; and (e) initiating regulatory reforms to eliminate
constraining enterprise creation and business licensing requirements. The Government is adhering to
many of its undertakings, but has not been able to contain the overall budget deficit, which reached about
15 percent of GDP in 1992 compared to a target of 6.6 percent, largely because of military expenditures
increasing from 2 percent of GDP in the 1980s to 8 percent of GDP in 1992. The macroeconomic
framework is being reassessed continuously by the Bank and the Fund. The August peace agreement is
a historic breakthrough putting an end to three decades of conflict within Rwandese society. The
restoration of political stability and establishment of a new government are expected to lead to a new
program, including revised targets. The private sector development project is a vital complement to



-2-
Rwanda's adjustment effort, by supporting medium to longer term institutional and business environment
reforms to facilitate private sector growth.
1.4          The objectives of public enterprise reform (para 3.14-16) include (i) putting in place
public enterprise (PE) legislation which increases management responsibility and harmonizes the legal
framework of PEs with that of private enterprises (adopted by the National Assembly in July 1993), thus
facilitating future PE privatization and restructuring; and (ii) developing and implementing a strategy
leading to privatization or liquidation of about 60 productive and commercial parastatals ad the
restructuring of the remaining 26 (the privatization strategy is expected to be approved by the Council
of Ministers by October 1993). Specific actions underway have already led to the privatization or
liquidation of five firms.
1.5          The adjustment program will be reinforced and broadened by two proposed sectoral
adjustment operations. The first one is a Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC) which aims to
improve the financial system's ability to support private sector development (paras 3.9-13). Specific
reforms, which are already being implemented, include: (a) reorienting and liberalizing interest and credit
policies, moving to indirect instruments of monetary and credit control, and developing new financial
instruments for improved savings mobilization and greater efficiency in investment lending; (b)
restructurng financial institutions in distress, thereby enhancing public trust in the sector; and (c)
strengthening the legal and regulatory framework governing financial institutions and establishing an
effective banking supervision system to ensure future stability. The second is an Agriculture Sector
Adjustment Credit (AGSAC) which would deregulate the agriculture sector and support the restructuring
and privatization of publicly-owned agro-industries. The IFC's Africa Enterprise Fund (AEF) has
expressed renewed interest in Rwanda, approving in 1992 the financing of two projects through a
Rwandese commercial bank. IFC's direct intervention is expected to complement IDA financing.
Measures being taken under the adjustment program, in particular, the legal enforcement of guarantees
by the Rwandese judicW system in a speedy and equitable way will contribute to improving prospects
for IFC interventions.
1.6          Strategy. Key to the success of the overall adjustment program is a significant and
sustained supply response by the private sector. Promoting the rapid expansion of the private sector is
the cornerstone of the Government's development strategy. This sector's development has been hindered
in the past by (a) unsustainable macroeconomic policies; (b) the presence of the State in several areas as
a competing privileged producer; (c) an inadequate incentives system with selective regimes of exemptions
and heavy government regulations; (d) deficient management capacity and insufficient labor skills; and
(e) the reluctance of the banking system to increase its volume of investment lending due to unadapted
(mostly short term) resources and difficulties in recovering delinquent loans. Beyond reestablishing
sustainable internal and external balances and laying the foundations for efficient financial sector
intermediation, the Government is taking specific measures to provide the private sector with both the
incentives and the means to engage in labor-intensive, export-oriented activities in an environment where
both local and foreign entrepreneurs can operate within a free market economy. The project is designed
to help in the implementation of this strategy, complementing the adjustment program.
1.7          Project Objectives and Description. The project will support efforts to ensure access to
investment financing and managerial and technical support for the private sector, and to improve the legal
and regulatory enviromnent in which businesses operate and enhance the investment and export
incentives. To achieve these objectives, the project consists of three mutually-reinforcing components:
(a) an Apex line of credit which will provide local banks with the long term resources needed to finance
medium- and long-term investment (paras. 4.17-18); (b) a private sector support fund (PSSF) to help



-3
entrepreneurs improve the conception and appraisal of their investment projects and strengthen their
production, managerial and marketing capacity (paras. 4.19-21); and (c) institutional support to the
Central Bank (BNR), the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Ministry of Justice, for the
establishment and staffing of the Tribunal of Commerce, to strengthen their capabilities and ensure
adequate implementation of reforms aimed at improving the business environment (paras. 4.22-23).
1.8          The credit component would satisfy an expected growing investment demand at a time
when political stability is being reestablished, and banks become more willing to lend because accelerated
and improved validation and execution of guarantees reduce their risk. The nascent investment demand
would be nurtured by the policy reforms (paras. 3.17-31 and 4.9-16), and through gains in productivity
and competitiveness made possible with assistance from the PSSF. This fund will enhance the ability of
promoters to conceive better projects and to encourage existing firms to expand and diversify, as they
become better managed and more competitive. To ensure that the objectives of the operation are met,
throughout project implementation, particularly during the planned mid-term review (paras. 5.11-12) of
the project, the Bank will engage the Government in a continued dialogue on the evolution and
implementation of the private sector development strategy.
II. THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
A. Overview of the Private Sector
2.1          As measured by GNP per capita, Rwanda is one of the 20 poorest countries in the world.
It is meagerly endowed with natural resources. It depends mainly on agriculture, which provides most
of the employment opportunities. The private sector in Rwanda is relatively unsophisticated and local
entrepreneurship is not yet well developed, except for a small but dynamic informal micro-enterprise
sector engaged in production and provision of services. The private sector plays a major role in the
production of export, food crops and in transport. Other private sector activities are found principally
in the informal sector, in international trade, where some 100 modern firms, mostly importers, currently
operate, and in a growing but limited service industry, principally in construction and management
consulting. Public sector enterprises are involved in the processing and export of primary commodities
and manufacturing, and generate about half of the country's formal employment outside the civil service.
In some cases such as coffee and the banking system such operations are in partnership with local and
foreign entrepreneurs,
2.2          Private trade associations and institutions remain underdeveloped partly due to past
government restrictions. The private business sector is in theory organized around the Chamber of
Commerce and Industry of Rwanda (CCIR). This institution, however, lacks autonomy and is part of
the public administration with its president appointed by the President of the Republic and key staff from
the civil servants. The CCIR's operating expenses are covered by government subsidies and obligatory
dues paid by the private sector. The CCIR has not been an effective intermediary in the dialogue between
the private and public sector because it lacks credibility as a lobbying group for the private sector. Since
1990, the Government has authorized the establishment of private sector groups, including the association
of industrialists which has been actively representing the modern manufacturing sector. Other groups
being formed include an independent Chamber of Commerce for Handicrafts in Butare with the help of
the German Cooperation.



- 4 -
2.3          One aim of the sector development strategy (paras. 3.32-41) is to encourage the growth
of private associations, including a private exporters' association. A key provision is that such groups
should operate independently from the Government so that they can be effective intermediaries between
the Government and private entrepreneurs. Restructuring of the CCIR so that it can become an
independent organization with officers elected by its members is also an objective of the Government.
The institution has received support from donors, including the UNDP/ITC, and the Government in the
past. Once membership becomes voluntary, continued financial support, at a declining rate, from the
Government or the donor community over the next three to four years will be needed until self
sustainability can be achieved.
B. The Private Sector in Agriculture
2.4           Private smallholders are responsible for the bulk of agriculture output which accounts
for 40 percent of the GDP. Up to 1983, the agriculture sector was the main source of growth, fuelling
the increase of GNP per capita at an annual rate of 2 percent. Production increase came from putting
most agricultural land into use and from eliminating fallow. The better lands are now farmed twice, even
three times, a year. Since 1984, agriculture has stagnated and thereafter experienced a steady decline due
to inadequate incentives and poor farming practices as well as inclement weather during certain years.
As a result, food production has not kept up with population growthl and this has created localized and
temporary pockets of famine. Inefficient agro-industrial PEs (particularly in tea) have contributed to
depressed producer prices and, therefore, rural income. Land is owned by the State, but, private
smallholders (5 per hectare of land on average) enjoy usufruct rights to continuously cultivated land,
which can be transferred to their male heir.
2.5           The major objective of the Government is to increase farm productivity and food security
through increased intensification and adoption of new policies aimed at (a) developing a market oriented
straegy for agriculture; and (b) encouraging fuller integration into the international market economy.
This is to be achieved through improved incentives and restructuhing of key parastatals. In this context,
land tenure issues will be taclded and de facto property rights will be strengthened. With the
implementation of these soctoral policies, agriculture should be able to sustain short- to medium-term
GDP growth. In the medium- to long-term, however, this sector will no longer be capable of being the
main source of growth nor will it be able to absorb a sufficiently large number of new entrants into the
labor market to ensure adequate levels of employment. These roles, therefore, will have to increasingly
be played by industry and services.
C. The Private Sector In Industry and Services
2.6          M. The private industrial and service sector accounts for less than 15 percent
of GDP. Manufacturing activities are in majority agro-industrial, coffee and tea processing, modern
beverage production, and/or production of basic consumer goods such as soap, textile products and
garments. Modern manufacturing-i...; formal enterprises with a registered legal status-consists of about
130 firms that employ a estimated 15,000 people, including temporary employees, and produce 8 percent
of GDP. Except for a handful, most of these firms have less than 100 permanent workers. The majority
of these firms, public and private, are relatively new: 106 out of 130 were established after 1975. About
two-thirds of modern industries are located in Kigali, the capital city. There are 21 industrial PEs,

-5-
including those with mixed ownership. These firms tend to be larger and more capital intensive than
private firms and contribute almost half of formal manufacturing output. Foreign investors have been
present in about half of the 130 firms.
2.7          Since their inception, many manufacturing firms have suffered from high production
costs, resulting in marginal economic viability, for two reasons. First, their management has lacked the
know-how needed to operate efficiently. Thus, they have failed to fully exploit opportunies to penetrate
the regional or domestic market. Second, at the time of their creation most local firms were protected
from competition through high tariffs and quantitative restrictions. In most cases there were two or les
domestic competitors, and they thus remained financially profitable, despite high wages (about twice thos
in Kenya and equivalent to 27 percent of turnover) and high cost of non-factor inputs (about 65 percent
of turnover).
2.8          Another characteristic of local firms, other than agro-industrial enterprises, is their high
import intensity. The onset of balance of payments problems in 1987 reduced the amount of foreign
exchange available to firms and caused a general fall in capacity utilization, which by 1989 reached about
50 percent operating only one shift. The subsequent decline in profitability forced an adjustment on the
manufacturing sector, which lowered its costs by investing less and deferring mainenance. Despite the
economic slowdown, aggregate employment, both temporary and full time, did not change significantly,
as labor laws made it difficult to lay-off workers. Since 1990 manufacturing production has declined
f-urther, by about 30 to 50 percent, primarily because of the adverse consequences of the war and the
decline in all economic activities. As long as the economic environment remained unfavorable and
uncertainty persisted, the private sector reacted by postponing new investments and not replacing worn-
out equipment. Now that the economic and political situation is becoming more favorable and with
improved incentives, a pent-up investment demand is expected to be realized during the next few years.
2.9          The Govermnent has taken a number of measures to address the problems faced by
manufacturing firms. Since 1991, economic recovery has been promoted by policy reforms and balance
of payments support from the SAC. Foreign exchange reserves increased from close to zero in 1990 to
an estimated 3 months of imports in late 1992. The level of reserves fell again in 1993 and will have
to be built up during the second half of the year. The resolution of the conflict will me the circulation
of goods to, from and within Rwanda, boosting domestic production and helping to reestablish business
confidence. In parallel, the Government has adopted a comprehensive private sector development strategy
(see Chapter III), aimed at putting in place a conducive business environment to ensure sustainable
growth. A series of measures will be taken, including those to be implemented under the project (paras.
4.9-16), to address the key structural and sectoral constraints and thus encourage viable firms to expand
their activities, and induce new viable investments.
2.10         Informal Productive and Service Enterprises.  Informal micro-enterprises, located
primarily in urban areas (about 40 percent are in Kigali), contribute an estimated 7 percent of GDP. A
census undertaken in 1990 by the Ministry of Plan revealed the existence of about 700 informal firms,
without a registered legal status, to which thousands of individual artisans and entropreneurs must be
added. The majority of informal businesses engage in retail and repair service, garment production and
woodwork.
2.11         This subsector could grow significantly and rapidly, expanding into formal activities with
the appropriate business environment and helping to manage larger operations efficiently. The informal
sector's growth would be supported by lowering the tax burden on enterprises, improving informal firms'
access to the Commercial Registry, lowering minimum capital requirements for corporations, facilitatn



- 6 -
the establishment of partnerships, and other policy reforms and actions envisaged under the project (para.
4.12).
2.12         Tr_d. About 100 registered firms specialize as importers, in addition to those that are
primarily manufacturers. Importers also engage in wholesale and retail domestic trade. Reflecting the
lack of export diversification, Rwanda has fewer than 20 exporting firms. Other than in the case of
traditional export products such as coffee, tea and other primary products, exporters tend to be producers
for the domestic market and export a small part of their output. A notable exception is horticulture
exports, a new activity that began in the late 1980s and sells most of its output in Europe.
2.13         In the late 1980s, many importers benefitted from de facto monopoly in particular product
lines; entry and competition was discouraged by the foreign exchange allocation mechanism and the
regulations governing enterprise creation and business licensing. Since 1991, importation is becoming
more competitive in response to trade liberalization and simplification of the regulatory framework. As
economic recovery occurs, this sector is expected to grow rapidly, both in the number of businesses and
in the volume of activity.
2.14         The reforms undertaken since 1991 have helped reduce significantly the anti-export bias
of the 1980s and should boost exports by existing firms as economic recovery accelerates. Export growth
and diversification, while modest at first, could be achieved quicldy for some activities, including tea and
horticulture, and manufactured goods. Such exports would be stimulated by new export promotion
measures planned by the Government (paras. 4.15). This export potential can be fully realized once
sectoral constraints, associated with inefficient PEs, involved directly in production or providing services,
and logistics are tackded. In the medium- to long-term, the development of exports will depend primarily
on sustained increases in competitiveness and expansion of the private sector, as well as learning how to
produce and market export quality goods.
2.15          Small Scale Mining. A few thousand private artisans currently engage in mineral
extraction (mainly tin). While they do not have formal concessions they are allowed to mine on
government land. More formal capital-intensive tin mining and production, including a smelter, and other
exploitations of minerals has existed in Rwanda in the early 1980s. These activities have been neglected
because of low profitability, pardy due to the overvalued exchange rate. The devaluations helped
improve this sector's competitiveness. There is evidence of renewed private interest in the development
and export of certain types of mineral products (including precious and semi-precious stones), but the
projects are at an experimental stage. The long-term viability of many mining activities, particularly
those using capital intensive processes, will depend on whether the mineral deposits now being explored
prove to be sufficiently rich.
2.16         Transport. International and domestic road transport is dominated by private operators.
In 1988, private interests operated about 1,900 truck/trailer (out of 2,500) and 85 percent of the 1,500
buses used in passenger transport (mainly minibuses). Three parastatals also provide transport services:
the STIR ('Societ6 des Transports Internationaux du Rwanda"), which transports external freight by road
and is slated for privatization; ONATRACOM ('Office National des Transports en Conmmun), a bus
company being restructured; and Air Rwanda, a small airline with five planes used mainly for domestic
passenger flights. One of these aircraft is a cargo plane that can be used on international routes to
transport freight. Air Rwanda also plays a key regulatory role in air transport; no flight, including
charters, can take place without its approval and payment of royalties to it. It also provides handling
services at the airport, at a relatively high cost. The royalties and proceeds from the services are used
to cover some of the deficit of the transport activity (paras. 3.29-3 1).



-7-
2.17         The transport sector grew rapidly until 1983, but slowed down due to the economic
downturn and inadequate institutional and regulatory arrangements. The key problems of the sector are
being taclded in the context of the Transport Sector project (Cr.2136-RW) and growth is expected to
resume with economic recovery. Policies already being implemented aim at: (a) providing flexibility of
choice and competition amongst providers of international transport by allowing the private sector to
freely select its transport mode, carrier and liberalizing prices; (b) improving the performance of PEs
through their privatization, restructuring and the use of performance contracts; and (c) a series of other
reforms aimed at improving road maintenance and safety, and diversification of access corridors
2.18         Consulting Services. Consulting firms generally provide basic accounting services and
undertake feasibility studies (see Annex 4). The subsector consists of about 12 private firms and 130 or
so individuals (mcluding civil servants and university professors, many working as part-time consultants),
three donor-funded technical assistance centers (Serdi, Technoserve and Center of Service for the Artisan)
plus BUNEP ('Bureau National d'Etude de Projets," a PE specializing in feasibility studies and auditing,
scheduled to be privatized in 1993), and at least 10 dynamic NGOs, including IWACU (a training and
research center) and Duterimbere (whose main role is to assist women entrepreneurs). The development
of private consulting services has been hindered by low effective demand. Private economic activity has
been at a low level and stagnant, and firms providing consulting services have suffered from competition
from subsidized donor-financed agencies. The public sector too has tended to rely on these agencies and
other publicly-funded organizations. The PSSF component of the project (paras. 4.19-21) would help
create a more level playing field, where the private sector can compete, and would stimulate
improvements in the quality and range of available services offered (e.g., international chartered
accountants, cost accounting and auditing).
D. Overview of the Filnancial Sector2
2.19         The financial sector in Rwanda is comprised of the Banque Nationale du Rwanda (BNR),
the Central Bank, three commercial banks - Banque Commerciale du Rwanda (BCR), Banque de Kigali
(BK), and Banque Continentale Africaine du Rwanda (BACAR) - and two savings institutions, the Caisse
d'Epargne du Rwanda (CER), which is being liquidated, and the Union des Banques Populaires (UBP).
A development bank, Banque Rwandaise de Developpement (BRD), a housing finance institution, Caisse
Hypoth6caire du Rwanda (CHR), and three insurance companies (SONARWA, SORAS, and INGOBOKA
a newcomer in 1991) complete the financial sector. Caisse Sociale du Rwanda (CSR), the social security
agency, is an important holder of long-term government securities. In 1991, total assets of the
commercial banks amounted to RwF30 billion (US$230 million) or about 12 percent of GDP.
2.20         The Government's presence in the sector is important. Except for one commercial bank,
two insurance companies and the system of savings and loans cooperatives ("banques populaires'), all
other financial institutions have total or significant public ownership. The Government does not normally
interfere with the functioning of the commercial banks where it has a substantial participation, but is very
much involved in the operation of the other financial institutions in which it participates.
2.21         Prior to 1987, the financial system was segmented, as commercial banks were restricted
by BNR to the provision of short-term credit Ooans of up to one year) and some medium-term loans (1
2  A more detailed analysis of the financial sctor was undertaken by the Bank in a report ied Rwanda: FinB ial
rview. Reoort No. 8934-RW, distributed to the Board on May 16, 1991.



-8-
to 5 years), while BRD and CHR were only permitted to provide long-term loans. Since then,
commercial banks have been allowed to make medium- and long-term loans, with ceilings for such loans
set at a certain percentage of total credit. In fact, after allowing commercial banks into this type of
lending, the authorities seemed to put less emphasis on maximum exposure limits for medium- and long-
term lending, and instead encouraged its growth. The importance of short-term lending by the financial
sector has declined during the 1980s, in part as a result of this change (see Annex 8).
2.22         The financial system is not well developed, as evidenced by its relatively shallow financial
depth. Financial depth figures (M2/GDP of 17 percent) put Rwanda below the average for low-income
countries and for Africa as a whole (M2/GDP of 24 and 22 percent, respectively). The degree of
financial repression has been mild relative to the experience in other developing countries. The only
official constraint on deposit interest rates in the 1987-90 period was that banks were required to pay a
minimum rate of 3 percent on 3-month deposits. However, due to imperfections in the financial markets,
linked on the one hand to lack of competition in the sector, and on the other hand, to inadequate policies,
which the Government is currently revising through financial sector reforms, commercial banls have
tended not to compete for deposits. Real lending interest rates which were slightly positive in the first
half of the eighties, were about zero or slightly negative in 1986 and turned significantly negative between
1988 and 1990. In 1991, interest rates were increased and their structure was substantially simplified as
a part of the adjustment program. Lending rates are pegged to the rediscount rate, to which a maximum
5 percent margin can be added by banks. This regulation puts an effective, albeit variable ceiling on
lending rates. The discount and lending rates, as well as the minimum rate on term deposit, have been
positive in real terms. As agreed, during negotiations, lending rates, as well as the maximum interest
margin, will continue to be reviewed regularly by the Bank and the Fund with the Govermnent to ensure
that rates remain positive in real terms (paras. 7.2 (iii)). In 1994 the interest rate regime will be fully
liberalized.
2.23         The slow progress in financial deepening, especially in the 1980s, in part reflects
government policy, which was oriented to use the banking system to direct credit to certain priority
sectors, and as a source of tax revenue. The low level of after-tax bank profits are due to the heavy
taxation of expatriate salaries and bank profits. The relatively small size of the market probably
discouraged additional entries into Rwandese banking and did not encourage competition. The low degree
of financial depth also reflects the low per-capita income level and the underdevelopment of the 'banking
habit'. Only the 'banques populaires' have a branch network covering the rural areas. Since 1991, the
Government has initiated the implementation of reforms of monetary and credit policy reforms (Annex 8
and paras. 3.9-13) designed to deepen financial intermediation and improve its efficiency.
E. Role of Donor Agencies in Private Sector Development
2.24         Several bilateral and multilateral donors are supporting private sector development in
Rwanda. To avoid duplicating existing programs and to learn from the experience of others an extensive
review of donor programs was conducted as part of the preparation of the project (a brief description of
these programs is given in Annex 3). These initiatives include: (a) operating grants and equity financing
for private sector operations and investment; and (b) technical assistance, including vocational training,
seminars and provision of specialized expert advice. The first type of support has been relatively
successful in helping to develop micro- and small-enterprises, particularly where technical assistance was
also provided. However, in a few cases where non-conventional technology have been tried, the results
have been disappointing. Another aspect of these programs is that many have been supply oriented
(creating the capacity to help entrepreneurs) and narrowly limited to specific activities, such as
woodwork, and to a specific region.



- 9 -
2.25         To maximize the use of scarce resources, donors have recognized that future technical
assistance and capacity building actions require improved coordination and supervision placing greater
emphasis on results and needs. The private sector also will be invited to be more directly involved in
specifying its own needs, particularly in the area of management and production assistance. Finally, the
Government has decided to improve its means of ensuring better coordination and coherence among donor
assistance, thus benefitting from the lessons learnt, and will receive support to reach this objective (paras.
4.22-23). The proposed PSSF (paras. 4.33-34) will also complement donor actions by stimulating
demand for expert assistance and broadening the target group to include all private Rwandese promoters.
m. pRIVATE SECTOR ISSUES AND
A. Recent Performance and Polides
3.1          In spite of its physical and resource constraints, Rwanda achieved positive per-apita
growth from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s. This resulted from the rapid expansion of agriculture
during the 1970s (8.7 percent annually for the period 1973-1980), brought about by improving farming
practices and increasing the surface cultivated,' and from the expansion of industry and services during
the first half of the 1980s (about 4 percent between 1980 and 1986). During much of this period,
Rwanda benefitted from the favorable evolution of international coffee prices, particularly in 1978 and
1986. Prudent foreign exchange management allowed a build-up in external reserves, which were used
to finance balance of payments deficits during subsequent years. The good economic performance hid
the impact of Government's intervention in the productive sectors, which led to (a) the creation of many
of the parastatals that still exist today; (b) trade policies heavily biased in favor of import substitution
(tariff and non-tariff barriers); and (c) discriminatory incentives (e.g., the investment code and business
licensing).
3.2          By the late 1980s, the economic cost of these policies became apparent as the steady
decline in the international price of coffee created a severe external imbalance. Local industries faced
a loss in regional competitiveness, due mainly to the appreciation of the exchange rate. . Moreover, firms
dependent on imported inputs needed to cut production because of the diminished availability of foreign
exchange. In parallel, the shortage of cultivable land, which limited agriculture growth after 1984,
combined with diminishing import substitution opportunities led to economic stagnation. These factors
as well as the disappointing performance of PEs, which drained scarce government resources, convinced
the Government to change its policies on exchange rate management and towards the private sector,
changing the public sector role to that of facilitator rather than regulator and producer.
3.3          In 1990, the Government initiated a structural adjustment program (paras. 1.3-5). The
Govermnent now recognizes that this initiative alone is not sufficient to ensure recovery and sustainable
growth, and that reform of sectoral policies and pro-active support to the private sector are also needed.
The adjustment program is thus being broadened, with the support of the Bank, to improve the enabling
environment and tackle the specific constraints retarding the growth of the private sector.  A
comprehensive strategy has thus been devised to taclde the constraints in agriculture and the financial
sector as well as tax, legal and regulatory barriers hindering the private sector.

B. Macroeconomic and Sectoral Issues and Constraints
3.4           Exchange and Trade Restrictions. Throughout the 1980s the Rwandese Franc (RwF) was
fixed with respect to the SDR (up to 1983) and the dollar (after September 1983). Despite a small
devaluation in 1983, the exchange rate became increasingly overvalued throughout the decade because
of declining terms of trade on export products (mainly coffee), infiation higher than that of major trading
partners and exchange rate adjustments in others. As a result, Rwandese products became less
competitive in the regional markets, particularly vis-a-vis those from Kenya and Burundi during the
second half of the 1980s. The overvalued exchange rate also contributed to the decline of some
traditional export activities (mining, cinchona and pyrethrum) and to the failure of some nascent non-
traditional exports (horticulture) in the late 1980s. Since the adoption of the adjustment program the Bank
and the Fund are engaged in a regular dialogue with the Government on the exchange rate to ensure that
it is maintained at a level consistent with balance of payments equilibrium under liberal trade policies and
to help improve the competitiveness and profitability of exports and viable import substitution activities.
As part of the adjustment program, the RwF has been devalued in two stages, in 1990 and 1992, by a
total of 61 percent (in foreign exchange terms).
3.5          From 1983 onwards, significant trade restrictions in the form of quantitative restrictions
(QRs) or bans, advance deposit requirements, import licensing and high duties prevailed in Rwanda. Up
to 1987, import restrictions were used mainly to protect local industries and, therefore, only affected
certain sectors. Thereafter, in response to a close to 50 percent decline in export receipts, trade
restrictions were extended to cover all imports, through strict import licensing. This policy was reversed
in 1991 in the context of the adjustment program and all QRs were removed and import licensing was
relaxed considerably. The Government is committed to maintaining and improving an open general
licensing (OGL) system for imports, introduced in 1992, and thus lifting any remaining de facto import
restrictions. Import controls were temporarily reintroduced in July 1993, in response to the depletion
of foreign exchange reserves resulting from war related expenditure. These controls should be lifted soon
as the situation returns to normal and reserves increase.
3.6          All export taxes, with the notable exception of that on coffee, have been eliminated. The
remaining regulations linked to exchange controls which continue to hinder exports will be removed under
the proposed AGSAC with the (a) elimination of export licensing; and (b) rationalization and
simplification of procedures at the airport, including the possible creation of a one-stop shop for
exporters. Such actions are an integral part of the private sector development strategy (Annex 2).
Repatriation of factor income (wages and dividends) by foreigners is subject to control which discourages
foreign investment. Foreign exchange available for businessmen's travel is also severely limited. Full
and immediate repatriation of factor income and an increase in foreign exchange available for travel are
being introduced under the adjustment program.
3.7          ImpotIaiffs. Tariff reform is an integral part of the adjustment program. The
elimination of QRs and the relaxation of import controls has significantly increased the role of tariffs as
an instrument of protection; for most of the 1980s, tariffs were redundant from the industrial protection
standpoint as local industries were sheltered from imports by non-tariff measures. Under the SAC, the
Government implemented significant tariff reforms in 1991. Measures introduced Included (a) reducing
the maximum rate from 220 to 100 percent; (b) increasing the minimum rate to 10 percent; (c) using a
single tariff instrument as opposed to two; and (d) reducing the number of applicable rates from about
14 to 5. As a condition of second tranche release of the SAC the Government will further reduce tariff
distortions by decreasing the higher rates to 40 percent for most finished products (80 percent for luxury
goods), and by harmonizing tariff rates for similar products.



-11-
3.8          The agreed tariff and trade reforms are being implemented and codified by the Ministry
of Finance in a new tariff law and revised foreignexchange regulations are being finalized by BNR. If
necessary, further reforms, for example, to reduce the effective tariff protection, will be considered
during mid-term review of the project scheduled for July 1995 (para. 7.5(v)).
Financial Sector Policies
3.9           The development of the financial sector is a critical component of the adjustment and
private sector development programs. In the past, the financial system suffered and bank portfolios
deteriorated, because monetary and credit policies aimed mainly at directing credit into priority sectors,
and thus discouraged the development of financial markets. In addition, BNR's interest rate and credit
policies discouraged resource mobilization and restricted bank lending. Since 1.987, the Government has
taken a number of steps to improve the functioning of the financial system. The main changes included
(i) permitting commercial banks to make medium- and long-term loans, up to a certain percentage of total
credit; (ii) in late 1990, adopting a policy of maintaining positive real interest rates by establishing a
minimum rate of 12 percent for 1-year deposits and a maximum lending rate of 19 percent; and (iii)
setting a single rediscount rate of 14 percent for coffee marketing and other operations. In June 1992,
estimates put inflation at single digit level on an annualized basis (actual inflation in 1992 was 8 percent).
In consequence the structure of interest rates was revised downwards in the context of the periodic
reviews agreed with the Bank and the Fund. Since then the maximum lending rate, the minimum 1-year
deposit rate, and the rediscount rate were reduced to 16, 9 and 11 percent respectively. During
negotiations the Government confirmed its commitinent to review interest rates at regular intervals to
ensure they remain positive in real terms (para. 7.2(iii)).
3.10         The proposed FSAC would support a comprehensive program for the development of a
well functioning financial sector and additional reform measures are included in the private sector
development policy matrix (Annex 2). The strategy for development of the financial sector includes:
(a) reliance on market-determined interest rates; (b) implementation of indirect means of monetary
controls and the elimination of direct controls; (c) the strengthening and restructuring of existing financial
institutions to make them more competitive and efficient; and (d) the institution of sound regulatory and
supervisory practices in BNR. A key objective of this strategy is to create a sound policy environment
and a solid institutional framework which can meet the investment financing and other needs of the
private sector. Another objective is to reduce Government participation in the sector and thus encourage
private sector development in a growing financial sector. In order to implement its strategy in the
financial sector the Government has identified, and already started to implement a number of reform
measures agreed with IDA. By letter dated December 30, 1992, the Government confirmed its
commitment to continue and complete the agreed reforms, with most measures to be put in place by
December 31, 1994.
3.11         Improved Resource Mobilization. During 1993 and 1994, monetary policy instrument
such as reserve requirements will be introduced; and others such as the rediscount mechanism will be
reformed. In addition, money market instruments will be developed, including a Treasury Bill Auction
system which has been studied and is scheduled to be put in place before the end of 1993. Monetary and
credit policies in the future will rely more on the use of reserve requirements and flexible interest rates,
and less on the rediscount facility at BNR. As a result, interest rates will be fully liberalized in 1994 and
the rediscount mechanism used only as a last resort to control money supply.
3.12         Increasing the Efficiency of Financial Institutions.  Commercial banks will be
strengthened financially by allowing tax-deductibility of provisions against bad debt and requiring their



-12-
risk assets to be covered in accordance with international norms, as determined by the capital adequacy
ratio (para. 7.6(iii)). Cerain financial institutions with controlling public participation, CER, BRD, CHR
will be restructured. In the case of CER the Government has already decided its liquidation, which is
now underway. BRD will be first financially restructured (Annex 14). An institutional development and
diversification program will follow, which is expected to pave the way for its possible privatization.
Finally, the guarantee fund (FSG, Annex 8-B) has failed to work properly because of the poor conception
of its operating rules and procedures, and its failure to honor its guaranty commitments. FSG by-laws
will be amended to make the fund an effective mechanism for increasing small entrepreneurs' future
access to credit while encouraging banks to exercise due diligence in credit supervision. Additionally,
all existing validated outstanding claims will be settled during 1993 (Annex 8-B and para. 7.4(i)).
3.13         Strengthening the Legal and Regulatory Framework. Reforms of the financial sector's
regulatory and legal framework are already underway and are expected to be completed within two years.
These reforms will shift from direct to indirect control mechanisms in the conduct of monetary policy
and strengthen the supervisory role of BNR. Planned actions include changes in the banking legislation
(Financial Institutions Law and BNR statutes), giving BNR clear authority over all banks and financial
institutions and enabling it to conduct effective monetary policy. BNR's mandate will include licensing
banks and financial institutions and setting minimum capital levels; establishing a minimum capital
adequacy ratio; implementing regulations on the classification and provision coverage of non-performing
loans; and limiting banks' exposure to a single party or group. BNR's revised banking law and statutes
are being finalized following IDA and IMF observations.
Public Enterrise Reform
3.14         There are 86 PEs, 60 of which are engaged in productive and commercial activities,
including 18 with majority private ownership. Certain PEs play a key role in the economy, despite the
sector's relatively low share of GDP (ess than 10 percent, including those with minority public
ownership). About 85 percent of exports (coffee, tea and other cash crops) are by PEs. The sector
employs about 15,000 people, and foreign loans on-lent to PEs account for about one-third of the national
debt. The sector's performance has been disappointing and many PEs have experienced steady losses
throughout most of the 1980s, despite subsidies received from the central government budget. Detailed
analysis undertaken in 1989 concluded that this poor performance stemmed from: (a) the absence of clear
government objectives and targets; (b) an incoherent and inconsistent legal framework which prevents
management autonomy and deflects accountability; (c) poorly qualified managers lacking business
expertise; (d) inadequate financial management and controls; and (e) inadequately conceived projects at
design stage.
3.15         Since 1990, the Government has embarked on a comprehensive program of PE reform,
supported by IDA under Cr. 2113-RW. The reform program aims to (a) reduce the burden that PEs
impose on the government budget and administrative capacity; and (b) develop and streamline the sector
to make it more efficient. Specifically, the implementation of this program will involve: (a) eliminating
new direct public investments in productive and commercial sectors; (b) changing and enhancing the
institutional and legal framework of PEs to increase their autonomy and accountability, and to ensure
better supervision by the Government; and (c) ameliorating PE performance through a comprehensive
restructuring and privatization program. In addition, in the context of the proposed AGSAC the
Government would speedup the restructuring and privatization of agro-industrial PEs, including the tea
subsector which has significant unexploited potential. The restructuring and privatization of other PEs
are also supported by other ongoing IDA Credits or proposed projects. These include a number of public
utilities such as Electrogaz (electricity and water, under a Credit approved by the Board on February 9,



-13 -
1993), the telecommunications company (under Cr.2189-RW), and Petrorwanda (importer and distributor
of petroleum products), whose improved services would play a key role in private sector development.
Some of these activities are natural monopolies, however, and the Government intends to adopt indirect
instruments of control to ensure that their pricing policies are consistent with public interest.
3.16         Administrative delays in Credit effectiveness of the PE reform project and subsequent
political instability initially slowed the pace of reforms and retarded restructuring actions. However,
progress has been achieved in adopting new legislation for PEs (approved by. the National Assembly in
July 1993) which, except in the case of those of purely administrative nature, would give them a legal
status which is in better harmony with private firms and facilitate future privatization. The Credit was
reoriented in June 1993 and greater emphasis was placed on its privatization element. This will support
the implementation of the Government's detailed privatization strategy, which is expected to be adopted
by October 1993. The strategy will facilitate a broad-based consultation on this often controversial issue
and permit faster implementation of the privatization process by avoiding a time consuming case by case
approach. Finally, the process of privatization has already begun. Two mixed industrial PEs (Sonatubes,
maker of pipes, and Rwantexco, a blanket manufacturer) were privatized in 1992. The Government also
decided to divest from and/or liquidate three other PEs, including the CER.
Private Sector Taxation
3.17         lhe Svst. Corporate income and other direct taxes accounted for only less than 10
percent of total tax revenue between 1987 and 1990 (about RwF2.5 billion annually, US$20 million in
1991 prices, excluding arrears and penalties), as the budget has relied increasingly on indirect taxation
and external grants to generate revenues. All registered enterprises, including PEs, are subject to the
same nominal tax system. In practice, taxes are paid only by the 25 or so larger firms in the modern
manufacturing sector. Most PEs and many of the smaller locally-owned private enterprises have not paid
taxes in recent years. Some fins have enjoyed tax holidays granted under the investment code, which
was suspended in 1991, while others have escaped taxation because of inadequate follow-up by the
Ministry of Finance.
3.18         The corporate income tax rate of 50 percent and the 20 percent dividend withholding tax
rate combine to an effective 60 percent tax on corporate profits. A levy of 3 percent of capital (the
upatente") is collected at the beginning of each tax year. This tax is both a minimum tax and an advance
by firms to the Government of that year's tax. It discriminates against firms with a high level of equity
relative to gross assets. For smaller firms, particularly micro and informal activities, the 'patente' is
specified in terms of an absolute amount according to the type and location of the activity. Operating
losses can be carried forward for a period of four years. Other corporate taxes include: a turnover tax
("impot sur le chiffre d'affaires', ICHA) of 10 percent on most goods and services, which has
undesirable cascading effects; and property taxes assessed on land, buildings and vehicles.
3.19          Constraints and Reforms. The corporate tax system in Rwanda discourages investments
by heavily taxing nominal returns. It also tends to distort resource allocation due to (i) favorable tax
treatment of debt-financed investments by allowing full interest deductibility; and (ii) a relatively heavier
effective tax burden on slowly depreciating assets (i.e., industrial machinery) resulting from the lack of
adjustment for inflation. The IMF has helped the Government improve the tax system and Its
administration by (a) bringing more firms into the tax net and thus creating an opportunity for revenue
neutral tax cuts; (b) training tax inspectors and computerizing the tax department to enhance monitoring;
and (c) redrafting various laws and regulations in the tax code to clarify tax provisions and reduce the



-14-
scope for its arbitrary interpretation. An IMF expert assigned to the Ministry of Finance, working in
Rwanda since 1991, has proposed a comprehensive reform program (paras. 4.10-11).
Legal and Regulatory Constraints
3.20         Sustained private sector development requires legal and regulatory reforms aimed at the
establishment of an enviroment for the free and unimpeded movement of capital and labor. To establish
this enabling environment, the existing laws need to be revised and implemented effectively, which in
turn requires setting up the appropriate institutions, specifically the proposed Tribunal of Commerce, and
creating the legal and paralegal professions needed to improve the transparency and speed of execution
of judicial decisions. The issues summarized below are based on studies and action plans agreed with
the Government for reforming business and labor laws (see Annex 6 and 7) undertaken during project
preparation.
3.21         Administrative Regulations. Until recently, Rwanda's administrative regulations hindered
private investment and entry into new business activities. This regulatory system originated in the late
1970s when administrative controls were put in place. Even though enforcement was relatively lax
initially, problems associated with this system became more severe in the mid-1980s, particularly as
macroeconomic imbalances increased. For example, incorporation took a year or more and business
licensing (to produce and engage in internal or external trade), which should in theory be a simple
annotation in the commercial registry, could take many months.
3.22         Recent reforms have focused on eliminating redundant regulations and rationalizing the
remaining procedures governing enterprise creation and registration, import and export trading and
licensing. In particular, prior approval of Ministry of Commerce and Industry has been eliminated for
enterprise creation. Furthermore, the law on the commercial registration was amended in August 1991.
The commercial registry was transferred to the civil courts, which presently act also as commercial
courts, and the paperwork was reduced and simplified.
3.23         The implementation of the new progressive regulatory system is being monitored and
improved continuously. To simplify enterprise registration, the information required will be standardized.
Maintaining the registry will fall under the competence of the proposed Tribunal of Commerce. To
ensure adequate flow of information among public agencies and other interested institutions, a
management information system wil be set up, and the commercial registry will be computerized. Funds
will be allocated under the project to finance the required technical assistance and institutional support
(para. 4.36).
Bsines Law
3.24         The legal framework and many of the existing business laws originate from Rwanda's pre-
independence period. Ad-hoc legal texts have accumulated since independence. Legal provisions on
business, real estate, fiscal and related matters are neither codified nor coherent. Some commercial rules
are included in real estate laws, fiscal and other texts. The present situation impedes prompt and
equitable judgments on disputes concerning enforcement of contracts and property rights. Moreover,
there is no clear definition or delimitation among judicial, legislative and executive authorities, leading
to a lack of checks and balances, and of transparency. Often, the same institution is responsible for
drafting, interpreting and executing a law. Another complicating factor is the absence of a specialized
Tribunal of Commerce and private auxiliaries of justice, which contributes to the legal system tending
to be biased against the private sector in its claims against the Government and to frequent delays in



-15-
settling business disputes: there are over 500 unresolved cases brought by banks alone that have been in
the courts for longer than 5 years without any meaningful actions or decisions by judicial authorities (see
Annex 8-B). Finally, in part because of lack of business expertise, judgments are not always fair and
well founded. The Govermment recognized the shortcomings of the existing business legal environment,
and launched a study of the existing legislation, which has identified the shortcomings of the legal
framework. The Government confirmed its agreement to take all measures necessary to reform and
modernize business laws, and create a Tribunal of Commerce (para. 4.12) during negotiations, and
implementation is expected to be completed by December 1994 (para. 7.4(ii)).
Labor LAw
3.25         The functioning of the formal labor market is hindered by policy induced distortions.
Current labor laws, which set conditions of employment, frustrate private sector and export development
in labor-intensive activities by inflating wage and non-wage costs, limiting labor mobility and decreasing
the number of days worked. A comprehensive analysis of labor laws, their application and their
economic inmpact has been completed and discussed with the Government. The Government has agreed
to the action plan proposed in the study (a synopsis of which can be found in Annex 7), which is a
condition of second tranche release of the SAC, and is committed to ensure its speedy implementation,
much of which is scheduled for 1993. Some of the agreed measures have already been implemented and
the rest should be completed at the latest by December 1994 (para. 7.5(iv)). The main problems
identified and the actions agreed (para. 4.14) to are as follows:
(a)    The Ministry of Labor maintains a registry of job seekers. Any enterprise employing
more than five permanent workers has to inform the Ministry of a vacancy, who then
prepares a short-list of candidates. Except for the lowest skill category, all positions have
to be filled from such a short-list, and the enterprise cannot select among other qualified
candidates. This policy aims to maintain an ethnic and regional balance, but it prevents
the labor markets from functioning adequately. The stated objectives are not reached in
practice, create undue delays, increase administrative costs and impose economic costs
on the private sector. The action plan calls for the elimination of the registry of jobs,
except to -the extent that it is necessary for its functioning as a clearing house for
statistical and informational purposes.
(b)    The movement of population is controlled in Rwanda. Thus, a job seeker who wishes
to obtain employment outside his/her county ('prefecture') needs to obtain a residency
permit there. In practice, however, such permits are difficult to obtain. This policy
severely restrains labor mobility and the Government has agreed to eliminate it.
(c)    The law sets minimum wages for various unskilled and skilled categories. The absolute
minimum wage, that for the lowest category of unskilled workers, is RwF100 (US$0.8),
which is relatively low. In practice, most workers are classified in higher skill categories
and all private sector workers receive a statutory annual increase (3.25 (d)). As a result,
formal sector wages are inflated: according to available estimates average labor costs,
including non-wage elements, in Rwandese manufacturing typically range between US$70
and 100 per month, about twice that of Kenya where productivity is much higher. The
agreed action plan provides for setting a uniform minimum wage.
(d)    The present law entitles employees to annual pay increases of at least four percent. In
the private sector, a yearly wage increase has become an assumed entitlement without



-16-
regards to merit, increasing the price of labor. The Government has agreed to eliminate
this practice, which will thereafter be freely negotiated between the employer and the
employee.
(e)    Employers are discouraged to rely on overtime work because statutory compensation is
quite high, 50 to 70 percent above normal wage rates. Moreover, workers benefit from
overly generous paid holidays, including normal vacation, official holidays, circumstantial
leave (marriage or death of relative), extraordinary leave (declared by the authorities) and
sick leave. As a result in 1991 the average worker in Rwanda worked for only 191 days,
45 days less than in most other comparable countries. The action plan seeks clarification
of the rules governing overtime and seeks to reduce the number of the various paid
leaves.
ort Promotion
3.26         Rwandese exports are not diversified, with about 80 percent of receipts being accounted
for by coffee and tea. Other traditional exports, including mining products (tin), pyrethrum and
chinchona, have been in steady decline. During the second half of the 1980s these traditional exports and
nascent non-traditional ones suffered from low profitability caused mainly by inadequate economic
policies, particularly the overvalued exchange rate. Coffee exports also stagnated because of steady
decline in the international price and insufficient investment in the activity to produce higher quality
products. Rwandese tea is one of the best in the world, but its potential with respect to production
volume and its price on international markets, is yet to be fully realized. The problems of the traditional
export activities are also related to inefficient PEs that operate upstream. These have tended to skim-off
a portion of the activities' surplus and contribute to losses. Non-traditional exports, particularly
manufactured and horticulture products, have shown some potential in recent years. Their development
has been constrained, however, by logistical difficulties, including air transport, and other weaknesses
attributable to insufficient know-how.
3.27         Reforms agreed to under the PE reform program (paras. 3.14-16) are expected to lead
to greater efficiency in export activities following the restructuring and privatization of inefficient firms.
The reform and privatization of coffee and tea operations are the focus of the proposed AGSAC, which
should help boost both activities. Non-traditional exports also would benefit from the improved business
environment and measures supported under this project, including the liberalization of air transport
(paras. 3.29-3 1). Because of the weak production base, expectations for export diversification and growth
in the short- to medium-term should be realistically moderate. Nevertheless, while the exchange rate
adjustments have improved significantly their competitiveness, the full realization of the exports' potential
will require additional measures.
3.28         To be internationally competitive, exporters will be compensated for indirect taxes levied
on their inputs. The compensation system alroady exists in the export promotion law (adopted in 1991),
but it does not function because administrative procedures have not yet been adopted (the law provides
for a restitution, in the form of a tax credit, equivalent to 10 percent of the fob value). Appropriate
procedures are expected to be put in place before the 1994 budget is approved: the tax credit would be
in the form of a negotiable certificate delivered promptly on the basis of only two documents, the
certification of export and proof of foreign exchange repatriation. A concerted effort is being considered
to encourage new purely export-oriented investments. A special regime, in the form of a free-zone
legislation, will be adopted to stimulate export processing activities, manufacturing under bond, and
reexport trade (para. 4.15). The examples of successful free-zones suggests that the main desirable



-17-
characteristics of this regime would include very simple regulatory requirements, a conducive tax
structure (typically a single tax of 15 percent on profits), and liberal labor regulations, including the
hiring foreign technicians and managers, and firing workers.
3.29         Air Transport. As a landlocked country, Rwanda's trade is dependent heavily on
international land and air transport. Most non-traditional exports, particularly those that are perishable
and of high value such as horticulture products, need to reach their final destination quickly which
mandates the use of air transport. Three Rwandese institutions provide support services and regulate the
sector. Airport management and various services (navigation, lighting, passengers etc.) are the
responsibility of a PE, the 'R6gie des aeroports". Air Rwanda, the national airline, performs handling
services at the airport and offers freight service to Europe with scheduled airlines; the market shares are
now determined by an agreement. Finally, air transport is regulated by the Ministry of Transport and
Commrunications (MINITRANSCO). Its responsibilities include approving landing rights, in which matter
it always consults with Air Rwanda.
3.30         Transport of freight by air is costly and there are only a handful of regular scheduled
destinations. A significant part of these problems is caused by inadequate regulatory arrangements and
the inefficiencies of Air Rwanda and the 'Regie". Airport fees for navigation, passenger tax and lighting,
are broadly in line with those levied in neighboring countries (Burundi, Kenya and Uganda). Landing
fees and related services, which cost about 50 percent less in Kenya, need to be revised (para. 4.16).
Airport operations are being studied (under Cr.2113-RW) with a view to improving performance.
3.31           Air Rwanda collects royalties from other airlines flying into Rwanda, which are passed
on to their customers. Its handling operations are highly profitable; figures show an income/cost ratio
of 600 percent in 1990. The royalties and profits are used to subsidize commercial operations, which
showed a deficit equivalent to almost US$2 million in 1990, not even covering variable costs. The
market sharing agreement is detrimental to competition and high handling costs penalize exports and
imports. Finally, the lack of regular air connections and administrative difficulties and the cost of
arranging for charter flights is an impediment to exports, which together with pricing policies will be
taclded under the project (para. 4.16).
C. Government Strateg for Private Sector Development
3.32         The Government believes that private sector-led growth in all sectors can provide much
needed employment and make a significant contribution to the diversification and expansion of Rwanda's
export earnings. Rwanda's physical constraints and the limited capacity of agriculture, however,
underscore the need for a vigorous program of actions in other sectors. The government strategy
focusses, therefore, on the imperative of making extraordinary efforts to improve performance in the
industrial and services sectors. While considerable progress has been achieved in the past two years with
regard to economic liberalization, particularly in the trade regime, the critical mass and depth of reforms
needed to elicit a sustainable supply response from the private sector have not yet been attained.
3.33         The development of the private sector has been hampered by policy barriers as well as
by regulatory constraints. The evolution of firms has been slowed by low domestic demand and
difficulties in exporting, exacerbated by an underdeveloped international transport system. Private
investment also has been hindered by poor access to long-term credit as well as by the lack of initial
equity, the presence of the state, as either a producer or a regulator and a relatively limited trading,
handicraft, or industrial tradition.



-18-
3.34         The industrial sector is small, even when compared with low-income developing
countries. Therefore, a limited supply response can have a notable impact. Most existing private and
public firms suffer from only marginal viability and their existing equipment is obsolete, worn-out, and,
in the case of some PEs, operate with inappropriate technologies. While existing viable enterprises would
benefit from being rehabilitated, much of future economic growth is expected to come from new
activities. Both private and public firms suffer from managerial deficiencies and low productivity of labor
which can be improved, thus rendering the enterprises more competitive.
3.35         The Government's private sector development strategy and related policy and institutional
reform measures are outlined in the Statement of Private Sector Development Policy and the matrix of
reforms (Annexes 1 and 2) adopted by the Government in May 1993. The proposed strategy consists of
putting in place an enabling environment that encourages investments in labor-intensive, export-oriented
activities and attracts foreign investors. A vibrant informal sector also could be an important source of
new entrants into modern activities. Informal sector entrepreneurs, however, need a conducive tax and
regulatory regime to bring them into the formal sector (paras. 2.10-11).
3.36         In order to turn around the performance of the private sector and give it a central role
in Rwanda's future development, the Government intends to combine policy reforms, institutional
strengthening, and aggressive action to attract and develop private entrepreneurship. Both labor and
capital will be priced freely to encourage employment creation. Furthermore, the effective disengagement
of the state from the productive sectors will provide new private investment opportunities. Public
disengagement will be made rapidly where the opportunity presents itself (where the state holds a
minority share), but may realistically take longer in other instances (para. 3.16).
3.37         The development of the private sector will depend on its acquisition of know-how and
the development of a skilled labor force. In the long run, the main objective will be to upgrade and
extend primary and secondary educition, giving greater emphasis to French, mathematics, and sciences
and to decreasing the number of high-school drop-outs. In the short- to medium-term, the focus will be
on improving and expanding vocational training facilities and management programs. Some of these
capacity-building efforts are expected to target key segments of the labor force with growing private
sector involvement in their design and implementation. The Government also proposes to support private-
sector driven efforts to strengthen business managerial and technical know-how immediately (Annex 5
and paras. 4.19-21).
3.38         Beyond continuing efforts aimed at macroeconomic and political stability, the economy
will be opened further to external competition through the adoption of a more active exchange rate policy,
a further reduction in effective tariff protection from imports, and full current account liberalization.
These measures, which are supported by the ongoing structural adjustment program, will create a free
foreign exchange allocation system and reduce the anti-export bias. Many of these reforms were initiated
in 1991, but their implementation needs to be strengthened and their coverage broadened (paras. 3.4-8).
3.39         Additionally, reforms will be extended to taxation (paras. 4.10-11) and the regulatory and
legal framework (paras. 4.12-13 and Annex 6). The objective of tax reforms will be to create a geneca1
system that not only does not discourage investors but goes beyond best practices in other countries, such
as Mauritius, to compensate for Rwanda's physical constraints. The resulting tax burden would be more
encouraging of investment, but would maintain fiscal revenues by combining lower tax rates with better
tax enforcement and more transparent provisions. The objective of regulatory reforms will be to remove
administrative barriers to enterprise creation and to eliminate those instances of business licensing that
serve no useful purpose. These reforms will be supported by a longer-term effort aimed at updating



-19-
obsolete laws and improving the enforcement of contracts. The resulting legal framework would
incorporate clearer provisions for enterprises and workable bankruptcy laws and develop the private legal
and paralegal professions.
3.40         Given the small size of the domestic market, an export orientation is essential.
Affirmative action for exporters will be necessary. Private consulting services partly financed by the
special fund (Annex 5 and paras. 4.19-21) will be made accessible to exporters also, in order to help
them resolve their logistical, marketing, and other problems. The Government will monitor and identify
bottlenecks in various export subsectors and help resolve problems as they arise. Air transport, which
is expected to be the main mode of transport for exports, should be liberalized (para. 4.16). Other
measures could also help promote exports. Effective implementation of the simplified tax compensation
scheme will also be important. The tax code, and a free-zone legislation (para. 4.15) need to be used
as a tool to attract export-oriented investment and small-scale enterprises.
3.41         The main remaining distortions are found in the labor market (Annex 7 and para. 4.14).
Evidence from the unregulated informal labor markets suggests that Rwanda has a comparative advantage
in labor cost. In many instances, however, the formal sector does not benefit from this advantage
because of labor laws and regulations that increase labor costs substantially. Without significant
reductions in these costs, the growth of both industrial exports and small and medium-sized enterprises
is likely to be severely constrained. Moreover, Rwanda needs to place greater emphasis on improving
labor productivity through the development of skilled labor, by upgrading manpower capabilities and
increasing the technical and industrial orientation of the educational system.
IV. THE PRJECI
A. Project Objectives and Justification
4.1           The Bank's main objective in Rwanda is to promote sustainable growth spearheaded by
the private sector with the Government acting as facilitator and provider of social services. To meet this
goal, the Bank is supporting the establishment of an incentive framework conducive for private sector
investment, and providing the means to enhance private sector competitiveness by encouraging its
rehabilitation. The structural adjustment and public enterprise credits are supporting the divestiture of
the State from productive and commercial activities and significant trade and price liberalization which
constitute significant steps towards opening the economy to internal and external competition.
4.2           Experience with adjustment in other countries has demonstrated that specific incentives,
institutional, and legal and regulatory issues hindering private investment cannot be addressed exclusively
by macroeconomic and public enterprise reforms. The removal of sectoral policy constraints and
institutional barriers is crucial for a substantial supply response. The Government has therefore requested
additional Bank support in these areas, which will be provided through two adjustment operations in
agriculture and the financial sector as well as through the project. The adjustment programs will provide
the Government with the financing required to sustain the balance of payments, while the project will
provide complementary resources for investment and institutional strengthening.
4.3           The proposed operation would therefore help create a business environment that would
enable the private sector to become the engine of growth. The action plan calls for measures aimed at
removing the key constraints to private sector development, including wide-ranging tax, institutional, legal



-20-
and regulatory reforms. To help ensure rapid and tangible results, the project will provide long-term
funds for private investment fincing and expert support to private operations and promoters, helping
them to become more efficient and able to take advantage of business opportunities. In addition, IDA
will provide the Government with the means to secure prompt and effective implementation of the agreed
measures and to strengthen its long-term capacity to be effective in its role of facilitator. The project has
explicitly taken into account the planned and ongoing efforts of the donor community to ensure
complementarily and avoid wasteful duplications.
B. Lessons from Previous Bank Experience and Bank Group Straten
4.4          Since the late 1970s, IDA has extended four lines of credit to the development bank
(BRD). The latest Credit (Cr. 1650-RW) was approved in 1986. It is fully committed and disbursements
should be completed by the Closing Date of December 31, 1993. The most recent project Completion
Report (PCR, No. 8799-RW) assessed the second and third Credits (Cr. 896-RW and 1344-RW). It
concluded that: (a) BRD faced problems due to the deteriorating macroeconomic environment and
increasing government interference; (b) BRD lending to risky small scale enterprises would adversely
affect the quality of its portfolio due to the low interest charged; and (c) recommended that future
operations should move away from a single institution approach towards an Apex type operation in order
to enhance sectoral performance. The project includes an Apex line of credit as one of its components
and the proposed FSAC is expected to tackle financial sector policy and institutional issues.
4.5          The experience of technical assistance projects in Rwanda has been mixed, in part due
to lack of ownership by the Government, and partly because experts have tended to substitute themselves
for their counterparts. The assistance for institutional strengthening proposed for the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry will draw lessons from the approach being implemented under the Public
Enterprise Reform project (Cr. 2113-RW). This approach relies on a mixture of short- and long-term
assistance provided by international and local experts, collaborating closely and effectively with qualified
and motivated government counterparts. The assistance to the Ministry envisaged under the operation
will be provided by local experts, to the extent possible. It will be organized so that it has adequate
access to decision makers to ensure rapid actions while working as a team with Ministry of Commerce
and Industry's staff and providing them with on-the-job training.
4.6          Adjustment lending in Rwanda dates back to 1991 only. During this short time period,
the Govermnent has demonstrated its willingness to follow up on its commitments. Implementation,
however, has been lacking at times. In some cases this was caused by circumstances that are difficult
to avoid; for instance the larger than agreed budget deficit was caused by increased military expenditure
to cope with security problems. In other cases implementing agencies have lacked the necessary
resources and capacity to ensure speedy and effective reforms. To avoid the second problem, the project
will finance the resources required by institutions responsible for executing the agreed private sector
reforms.
4.7          The Bank group strategy is to support private sector development through adjustment
credits, and investment and technical assistance operations. The ongoing adjustment program (SAC) will
be reinforced and broadened by two proposed sectoral adjustnent operations in the financial and
agriculture sectors (FSAC and AGSAC). The IFC has expressed renewed interest in Rwanda and
envisages future involvement in the privatization of PEs and financing private investment to complement
the Apex line of credit. Finally, the ongoing Public Enterprise Reform Credit is helping the Government
in its PE restructuring and divestiture efforts.

C. Prolect Description
4.8          The project is an investment operation comprising of a line of credit to finance investment
projects through participating financial institutions (PFIs); a fund to provide market-based demand-driven
management consulting support to private companies and promoters (the PSSF); and resources to
strengthen institutions (BNR, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the proposed Tribunal of
Commerce) responsible for facilitating private sector investment and development. These mutually
reinforcing components will ensure that the major internal and external constraints to the sector are
alleviated, and that long term resources are available to finance the private sector investment stimulated
by the elimination of these constraints. In addition the Government will continue the process of policy
reform under this operation, undertaking critical actions spelled out below (paras. 4.9-16) and in the
Statement of Sectoral Development Policy and the policy matrix (Annexes 1 and 2).
Imlementing the Government Strategy: Policy Measures
4.9          The implementation of the government strategy is supported by the project.  The
Government has agreed on a set of objectives and the associated timetable for actions (Annex 2) and will
ensure that implementation agencies have the required resources. The realization of the strategy would
entail taking specific measures to tackle the following policy constraints:
(a)    Enabling private sector growth through (a) the adoption of a clear and well adapted legal
and regulatory framework, particularly with regard to legal enforcement of contractual
obligations (para. 4.12); (b) effective liberalization of factor markets, particularly easing
labor regulations with respect to compensation and hiring (Annex 7 and paris. 4.14);
(c) a more evenly distributed transparent tax system that lowers the maximum tax burden
and causes fewer distortions in investment decisions (para. 4.10); and (d) amelioration
of export incentives (para. 4.15).
(b)    Attracting new investments and improving the competitiveness of existing private firms
by: (a) reaffirming the principle of freedom to invest without restrictions on the size of
the investment, the sector and ownership; (b) availing long term resources to the financial
sector so that it can finance medium- and long-term investment (paras. 4.17-18); and (c)
helping overcome managerial and entrepreneurial shortcomings, which have led to poorly
conceived projects and make firns inefficient (paras. 4.19-21).
(c)    Strengthening key institutions (paras. 4.22-23), including BNR, the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry, and the Ministry of Justice (Tribunal of Commerce), responsible
for implementing and following-up the desired private sector development strategy and
ensuring that the agreed measures are put in place properly.
4.10          In the area of tax reform measures to be taken include the following:
(a)    Allowing banks and financial institutions to deduct allocations to provisions for doubtful
loans from taxable profits when such allocations are made in accordance with loan
classification and provisioning guidelines issued by BNR.
(b)    Replacing the turnover tax rate of 10 percent with a value-added tax (VAI) of 10 to 15
percent.



-22-
(c)    Implementing reductions of the corporate income tax rate, starting with the elimination
of dividend taxation.
(d)    Counteracting the effecs of lack of inflation accountng and inadequate depreciation
allowances by revising schedules allowing for faster depreciation of machinery and
equipment, by permitting the legal, tax deductible, reevaluation of assets, and allowing
to carry-forward losses over five years instead of four years.
4.11         During negotiations agreement was reached that, except for the VAT which requires
further preparation and will be introduced later-on, the revenue neutral reforms listed above would be
implemented by end 1993 (para. 7.5 (ii)). The mid-term review will assess the implementation of these
measures and will evaluate and study the need for further reforms, including the introduction of the VAT,
and the possible reduction of the tax rate on corporate income, from its present rate of 50 percent, within
the restrictions imposed by the budgetary situation.
4.12         In the area of business law reform, the project would support the establishment of the
Tribunal of Commerce (para. 3.24) as well as the implementation of the action program to put in place
modern business laws and remove observed deficiencies by undetaking the following (the detailed
description of the proposed reforms are set forth in Annex 6):
(a)    Liberalization of the rules governing the establishment, registration and functioning of
business enterprises (para. 7.5(iii)).
(b)    Simplification and updating of the regime of negotiable financial and commercial
instruments, guaranties, secured transactions, sales, leasing and factoring (para 7.5(iii)).
(c)    Modernization of bankruptcy procedures (para. (7.5(iii)).
(d)    Promulgation of a law establishing the Tribunal of Commerce, appointing a qualified and
experienced lawyer as its President, and adopting the text regarding its organization and
functioning (para. 7.4(ii)).
(e)    Propose new administrative procedures and an acceptable timetable for settling pending
disputes related to banks' loans within a period of three years (paras. 3.24 and 7.4(ii)).
(f)    Authorize the creation and functioning of private legal and paralegal professions including
notaries-public, process servers, liquidators and auctioneers (paras. 3.24 and 7.5 (iii), and
Annex 6).
4.13         The above undertakings were agreed to by the Government during negotiations; (iv) and
(v) are conditions of disbursement for the institutional strengthening component; (i)-(ii) and (vi) would
be completed by December 31, 1994. The project wIll finance, through its assistance to the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry (paras. 4.35), consulting services and studies to codify and modernize Rwanda's
commercial real estate, and other economic regulations and legislation. Most of the reforms and revisions
require technical work which is expected to be completed during 1993 and 1994 and implemented by
December 1994. To allow sufficient time to determine its impact, the revised legal framework will be
assessed during the mid-term review of the project. A decision on the creation of the Tribunal of
Commerce was confirmed during negotiations (para. 7.2 (ii)). Belgian assistance has already financed



-23 -
an initial study and has committed a grant (about US$1 million) to finance the technical work required
to revise business laws. The Credit would thus only finance limited short term complementary assistance.
4.14         The Government has agreed to revise the labor code (para. 3.25) to accommodate the
following changes: (a) abrogation of the obligation of prior enrollment in the registry of jobs; (b)
elimination of work permits for nationals; (c) setting a uniform minimum wage; (d) permitting wages and
annual increases to be freely negotiated between the employer and the employee; (e) clarifying the rules
governing overtime; and (f) reducing the number of the various paid leaves. During negotiations the
Government agreed to implement these measures by December 1994 (para. 7.5 (iv)), which would allow
adequate time for adoption by the National Assembly. These changes and other outstanding issues would
be discussed during mid-term review.
4.15         To remove the bias against exporters, the administration of the tax rebate will be made
operational in 1993. The project will also fnance the required assistance for the Ministry of Commerce
and Industry to prepare the free-zone legislation (para. 3.28). Technical work should be completed in
1993 and during negotiations agreement was reached that the free-zone regime would be in place by
December 31, 1994, (para. 7.5 (i)). The effectiveness of export promotion policies and ways to further
enhance them will be assessed during mid-term review.
4.16         In the area of air transport (paras. 3.29-31), and with a view to facilitate exports, the
project will have as one of its objectives the simplification of the procedures for obtaining landing rights
for charters so as to allow for timely and systematic delivery of the necessary permits within 24 hours
of a request being submitted. This will require the elimination of all de facto regulatory power of Air
Rwanda. Under the PE reform project and on the basis of a recently completed study, landing fees will
be reassessed in 1993 and made consistent with marginal cost pricing. During negotiations agreement
was reached that appropriate measures would be taken so that air transport would be liberalized by June
30, 1995 (para. 7.5 (i)).
Supporting Investment: Credit Component
4.17         The current macroeconomic projections by the Bank and the Fund estimate private sector
investment of about 6 percent of GDP annually (US$120 million) to achieve GDP growth of 4 percent
over the next three years. The project proposes a relatively modest line of credit of US$7 million on the
expectation that this small operation will enable BNR and the PFIs to internalize the system and will
satisfy existing pent-up investment demand. The size of the line of credit component is estimated on the
basis of actual investments by private firms between 1985 and 1990, taking into account only viable
projects, as well as the pipeline of existing projects as a base, adjusted by the estimated pent-up demand
and projected investment response to the policy stimulus. IDA financing will be through an Apex line
of credit (paras. 4.24-25). The line of credit would finance, through eligible financial intermediaries,
the foreign exchange and local component of investment for new and existing enterprises registered in
Rwanda on the condition that such projects are economically viable, financially profitable and
environmentally sound. Investment to rehabilitate privatized PEs and the necessary working capital
associated with investment will also be eligible. It is expected that the majority of projects will be
manufacturing and agro-industrial investments as well as for the permanent working capital of industrial
enterprises.
4.18         After four years of postponing investments, considerable pent up private investment
demand for new, and extension and rehabilitation projects has built up (Annex S-A). BRD's pipeline of
projects under study would require loans of about 7.2 million for 70 project proposals. The Ministry of



-24-
Commerce and Industry has also compiled a list of 60 private investment projects, mostly exclusive of
the BRD pipeline. Assuming a 50 percent casualty rate, these projects would require a conservatively
estimated US$20 million in loan financing. While comprehensive global rehabilitation investment needs
and permanent working capital figures were not available, case studies showed that their respective
financing requirements would be around US$10 and USS4 million, respectively. Thus the estimated
investment financing demand over the next three years surpasses US$30 million. Assuming continued
and speedy implementation of the legal and regulatory reforms, the prospective economy-wide investment
demand is therefore estimated to steadily increase from US$7 in 1993 to US$20 million a year in the
following four years. On a commitment basis such levels of investment demand imply an annual gross
term credit demand of US$5 to US$13 million in local and foreign currencies. It is estimated that during
the commitment period of September 1, 1993 - December 31, 1998, demand for IDA funds would
amount to 18 percent of the total estimated term credit demand of US$40 million, i.e., US$7 million.
Remaining financing would come from the supply of term credit resources in the banking system and
from external donors, including IFC's Africa Enterprise Fund (AEF).
Encouraging Entrepreneurship: Private Sector Supnort Fund
4.19         Private entrepreneurship in Rwanda remains nascent. Most firms suffer from managerial,
marketing, technological and other deficiencies which decrease their efficiency and competitiveness. The
absence of concrete affirmative actions aimed at improving initial project conception and subsequent
enterprise efficiency, would thus prevent supply response to reach its potential and be sustainable beyond
the medium term. At present, the problems typically encountered tend to be relatively straightforward
(e.g. project conception and feasibility, financial management and accounting, stock management,
adopting simple improvements design and production techniques). These problems are expected to
become more complex as the private sector grows and becomes more sophisticated (e.g., issues related
to technological acquisition and export development).
4.20         The project, learning from lessons of the past, will tackle this problem by financing the
operations of a demand-driven market-oriented private sector support fund (PSSF, detailed in Annex 5).
Private entrepreneurs will be encouraged to hire management consultants with the expertise needed to
solve their accounting, marketing, production and other problems. The fund will share in the cost of
securing these services through IDA financed grants from the Government to private promoters (paras.
4.33-44). This approach will thus reduce the risks caused by the initial uncertainty associated with
investments by firms in human capital. The PSSF will also play an important role in sensitizing the
private sector to the need to enhance its performance and competitiveness, by organizing specialized
training programs and undertaking other forms of advertising to ensure that all promoters, irrespective
of size and location, are aware of this facility. The seminars would be designed to encourage managers
to focus on their operations' internal problems.
4.21         The primary rationale of the PSSF is therefore to strengthen managerial, technical and
operating expertise of the private sector, make it more competitive and encourage it to find investment
opportunities, so as to support sustainable private sector-led economic growth. A secondary objective
is to create a competitive market for quality consulting services and thereby open new opportunities for
the private sector. Private promoters would select their own qualified consultants and would pay for part
of the cost of the service the rest of which, up to a given ceiling and on a declining basis, would be
financed by the Fund. The Credit would contribute US$1.5 million to this fund (a modest sum equivalent
to about 0.5 percent of annual value added by private industries and services), on the expectation that
once the approach is demonstrated to be a success other donors would provide additional resources.
Seminars, advertizing, management, monitoring and implementation costs are estimated at an additional



-25-
US$1 million, also to be financed under the project. All private industrial and service activities, except
for large firms employing more than 250 permanent workers and subsidiaries of foreign firms, would be
eligible to use the fund and participate in the seminars.
Supporting Improvements in the Business Environment: Institutional Strengthening Component
4.22         Weakness in public institutions and unclear responsibilities have led to uneven treatment
of the private sector and lack of coherence in policies. Under the present arrangements the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry is the main institution responsible for implementing the private sector strategy
and facilitating private sector development, outside agriculture. This Ministry lacks the capacity in
human and financial resources to implement this aspect of its mission. Moreover, it does not have a plan
of prioritized actions. The Government has agreed that the Ministry should: (a) be responsible for
monitoring and implementing policy actions agreed to within the context of the private sector development
strategy; (b) coordinate and follow on behalf of Government actions undertaken by donors; and (c)
establish an effective dialogue with representatives of the private sector and, to the extent feasible,
respond to their complaints (outline of draft terms of reference for the strengthening of the Ministry of
Commerce can be found in Annex 9).
4.23         The project will provide financing of US$1 million to the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry, which will cover the incremental costs associated with the expanded responsibilities of the
Ministry. This amount will provide resources to ensure proper implementation of the agreed strategy,
including short- and long-term experts, training the permanent staff of the Ministry, purchasing the
required office and computer equipment, and ensuring the effective implementation of the reforms
supported by the project (Annex 2 and paras. 4.9-16). The creation of the Tribunal of Commerce (Annex
6) is another key action supported by the project and once the condition of disbursement related to its
creation is met (para. 7.4 (ii)), it would receive financing of US$0.7 million to cover its short term
assistance, equipment and training needs. Finally, another US$0.3 million will be provided to BNR, as
a government grant, to finance its training needs as well as that of key staff of financial institutions
participating in the Apex credit (para. 4.24).
D. Institutional Arraneements
APEX
4.24         Project Management. The credit component would be made available to all sound
privately sponsored investment projects, through eligible financial institutions with BNR acting as an
Apex institution. These institutions were appraised and are described in detail together with BNR in
Annex 8. Proceeds from the Credit would be channelled through BNR to the eligible participating
commercial banks and the development bank, which would in turn lend to the final beneficiaries of the
project. The participating financial intermediaries wIll assume the full financial and commercial risks of
the subloans granted under the Credit. BNR has agreed to act as the Apex institution, and to make
available necessary budgetary and staff resources to that effect through its Department of Monetary Policy
(DPM), which is also in charge of rediscounted credit operations. A one percent interest margin will
cover the required operating budget of the subloan administration component (para. 5.2). The DPM was
appraised and found to be a suitable conduit for administration of the Apex Credit component (Annex 8).
However technical assistance and training of the staff of the DPM and participating financial
intermediaries will be required, and to that effect, US$300,000 will be allocated under the institutional
strengthening component (paras. 4.23 and 4.36). The DPM will review appraisal reports of PFIs and
approve their refinancing requests, as well as subloan administration and supervision. BNR has agreed



-26-
to enter into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the Government defining the functions and responsibilities
of the DPM, under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The signing of the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement is a condition of effectiveness of the Credit (para. 7.3).
4.25         Eliiibility of Participating Financial Intermediaries. Banking institutions in Rwanda are
generally sound, but the difficult environment of the past few years has affected the quality of the banks'
portfolios. The financial and institutional appraisal undertaken and detailed in Annex 8, has determined
the eligibility of two commercial banks and, subject to the implementation of a restructuring plan, of the
development bank. BCR, BK and BRD are deemed eligible as participating financial intermediaries
provided that they meet specific eligibility conditionalities and satisfy general eligibility criteria as detailed
below. With regard to the fourth commercial bank, BACAR, its eligibility is deferred until it has
implemented the recommendations of its auditors to increase its provisions for risks and take measures
to improve its interest margins and profitability. A review of BACAR's 1992 audited financial statements
will help determine whether it has implemented such recommendations. As for BRD, it has already taken
measures to improve loan collection, and it has agreed, during negotiations, to implement the
recommendations of the just completed study, analyzing its sustainability (para 7.2(iv)). Measures to be
taken include making additional provisions for risks of losses, organizational restructuring to close
unprofitable branches, and staff reduction. BRD has also agreed to defer plans to enter into commercial
banking activities pending further studies and implementation of the agreed measures. An action plan
to improve BRD's performance (Annex 14) has been agreed to during negotiations, and satisfactory
progress on its implementation is a condition of BRD's eligibility (para. 7.6(iv)).
4.26         Participating financial intermediaries will agree to implement institution-buildingmeasures
as required under the project, and to undertake annual audit of their financial statements by independent
external auditors satisfactory to IDA and BNR. The eligible participating financial institutions (PFIs) will
enter into a Participating Agreement with BNR (para. 7.6 (ii)) in which the PFIs further agree to
undertake the following:
(a)    Designate qualified staff to manage the subloans financed by the project.
(b)    Perform satisfactory subproject appraisals based on agreed procedures and formats and
submit the appraisal reports to the DPM; in so doing PFIs will pay particular attention
to sensitizing project promoters on potential environmental hazards of individual
subprojects, and adhering to Bank Procurement and Environmental Guidelines agreed
under the project, in close coordination with DPM.
(c)    Maintain simple administrative, lending, guarantee, and disbursement procedures to
facilitate commitment and disbursement of investment projects.
(d)    Ensure that resources are used by the final borrowers for the purposes intended.
(e)    Supervise the implementation phase of subprojects and promptly inform the DPM of
major problems expected to delay disbursements and project completion; to that effect
submit periodic reports on the status of subprojects.
(f)    Provide training for their operational staff and technical assistance to build up internal
capacity and carry out the tasks described above.



-27-
(g)    Adhere to agreed terms and conditions of lending and repayment of loans and bear the
credit risk.
(h)    Provide the DPM and IDA with such information as they would reasonably request,
including annual audits of their financial accounts and statements performed by qualified
and independent auditors, acceptable to IDA.
4.27          A draft participating agreement has been finalized with the interested parties during
negotiations. Receipt by IDA of a satisfactory signed agreement between BNR and a participating
intermediary is a condition of disbursement of the credit component for that PFI (para. 7.4 (i)). In
addition, all PFIs will have to maintain a satisfactory capital adequacy ratio according to the Cooke
method (para. 7.6 (iii)).
4.28         Eligible Beneficiaries and Subproiects. All productive and extractive activities, transport,
trade and all other services which contribute to the economic development of Rwanda will be eligible for
financing. The only ineligible projects will be the financing of land acquisition, development, and
housing and office construction, and investments by parastatals with majority government direct and
indirect ownership. The line of credit will finance fixed assets and associated permanent working capital
for new operations, extensions and rehabilitations. Self-standing permnt working capital requirements
for industrial enterprises will also be eligible. Working capital requirements of commercial and service
enterprises are not eligible. Eligible subprojects will have to meet the following criteria in order to be
approved for refinancing under the credit:
(a)    A minimum projected financial rate of return of at least 10 percent in constant prices for
all subprojects as well as a minimum economic rate of return of 10 percent for
subprojects with estimated investment costs of US$350,000, or more.
Q,)    The projected debt servicing capacity (defined as the ratio of interest and principal annual
payments to cash-flow generated from operations), should be no less than 1:1.5 over the
life of the subproject and the debt to equity ratio should be no more than 2.33:1 with the
ratios calculated on the basis of the enterprise's total debts, inclusive of those to be
incurred under the subproject.
(c)    Satisfactory environmental impact reviews will be undertaken according to the National
Environmental Action Program, and as deemed necessary by the DPM or IDA, in cases
where the technical review of appraisal reports of selected projects indicate they represent
potential environmental hazards (para. 6.3).
4.29          Sub-loan Processing and Administration. Sub-loan processing under the project will be
coordinated and centralized by the DPM, which will serve as the principal link between IDA, the
participating intermediaries and the beneficiaries for the project's investment component. Subproject
appraisal reports would be prepared by the beneficiaries in accordance with the agreed project appraisal
procedures and criteria with, as needed, assistance from the DPM, and presented to the financial
intermediaries. Tbe latter would review the fmancing requests in accordance with their own appraisal
and lending criteria and internal operating and decision procedures, and submit an appraisal report
conforming to the agreed format to the DPM for refinancing approval under the line of credit.
4.30          The DPM would review the appraisal reports to verify that all eligibility and financing
criteria and conditions are met. This appraisal review would be carried out on the basis of a simplified



-28 -
appraisal report for projects with an estimated investment cost of US$350,000 or less (within 5 working
days) and on the basis of more in-depth reports for projects with a higher investmnent cost (within 10
working days). These reviews will also ensure that subborrowers have undertaken procurement consistent
with agreed Bank Group guidelines (para. 5.18). If the subproject is eligible for refinancing and satisfies
the required technical, economic, and financial rates of return criteria, the DPM will authorize the
intermediary to present the relevant disbursement documents for reimbursement of eligible expenditures
or opening of letters of credits for foreign suppliers. Subprojects requiring subloans equivalent to, and
exceeding 13 percent of the Credit component, i.e., US$900,000, would not be eligible for refinancing.
4.31         To ensure internalization of project appraisal procedures, PFIs, excluding BRD, would
require prior IDA approval of their first three appraisal reports, including at least one requiring an
economic rate of return calculation. In view of BRD's familiarity with IDA procedures and its experience
in project appraisal it will be exempted from the beginning from prior IDA review. The DPM would
review and approve PFI requests unless IDA otherwise agrees. IDA would review a sample of
subprojects, appraisal reports, and approvals on an ex-post basis during supervision missions.
4.32         BNR, through the DPM, will serve as disbursement and collection agent for the financing
granted to intermediaries. The DPM would directly manage subloan refinancing and collection operations
upon approval. On the basis of the DPM's instructions and authorizations, the Financial Operations
Department of BNR would debit or credit the appropriate financial intermediary's accounts, and execute
letters of credit confirmations and other disbursement operations without further intervention in subloan
processing. Signing of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and BNR is a condition
of Credit effectiveness (para. 7.3).
Private Sector Supoort Fund
4.33         This component will be under the supervision of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry,
but managed independently by a small team of experts financed by the project and housed in the Bank
of Kigali, chosen because of its independence from the Government, dynamism and good image among
the private sector. The BK has already agreed to provide the appropriate office space at nominal fee.
The Credit would finance US$2.5 million for this component. The approach is complementary to that
of other donors and consists of a demand driven scheme, whereby the consultant is chosen by the
entrepreneurs who also specify the nature of the assignment. A portion of the fees of such consultants
will be paid by a fund set up specially for this purpose (detailed in Annex 5). The following objectives,
and criteria will be used:
(a)    The fund's (PSSF) role is to provide matching grants. Its management and staff are
responsible for making sure that consultants hired are qualified, checking that the work
program is clear, monitoring the interventions and evaluating their effectiveness.
(b)    The approach proposed involves subsidizing the service recipient and not the provider of
the service. Entrepreneurs must show real commitment by sharing in the cost and would
'graduate' so that their use of the fund is limited to US$100,000 of consulting services.
The following cost sharing scheme is proposed:



-29-
Cumulative Consulting Costs      Paid by:     PS     Beneflciaa
Up to US$10,000                                70%      30%
US$10,001 to US$50,000                         50%      50%
US$50,001 to US$100,000                        30%      70%
(c)    In order to focus the attention of the private sector on the existence of inefficiencies
within their firms, enhance their analytical skills and encourage their initiative, regular
specialized ten-day training seminars will be organized (see Annex 5 for seminar outline).
These seminars would first be given by international experts but the methodology should
be progressively transferred to local trainers.
(d)    The fund will finance equally local and international experts, but local firms are likely
to engage in joint ventures with foreign consultants to upgrade their own skills. With
regards to international experts, the fund would maintain a roster of qualified French-
speaking retired executives who could provide expert advice, and could also help
organize the training seminars, at a fraction of the costs of other experts.
(e)    To ensure transparency and efficiency, the existence of the fund should be properly
advertized through the media, so that all entrepreneurs are aware of it. A reputable
NGO, IWACU, will be responsible for explaining the approach to the informal/micro-
enterprise sector. Larger, formal enterprises will be reached through the association of
industrialists and the CCIR, once it is restructured. The following principles will also
be respected: (a) the cost sharing rules should be strictly adhered to; (b) the accounts will
be regularly audited by an external auditor, up to twice a year during the first two years
of operations; and (c) the discretionary power of the fund management will be
minimized. In particular, only consultants who are clearly not qualified for the work
proposed or who have a poor track record with the fund can be rejected.
(f)    Firms with more than 250 permanent employees or with at least 20 percent ownership
of capital by a multinational corporation, as well as PEs with majority public ownership
would not generally be eligible for financing by the PSSF.
4.34         During negotiations agreement was reached on the rules and procedures of the fund. The
selection of a qualified international expert, financed under the Credit, to manage the fund, and the
adoption and publication of PSSF procedures in at least one newspaper are conditions of disbursement
for the fund (para. 7.4 (iii)). The fund manager will select a Rwandese expert as his deputy and hire
appropriate support staff (maximum of two). It is expected that after two years the intenational expert
will be replaced by a national expert, possibly the deputy manager. The PSSF will prepare quarterly
reports on its activities, which should include problems encountered, describe the actions undertaken, and
provide an ex-post assessment of actions financed after allowing for sufficient time lapse. The fund's
management will be responsible for stimulating the interest of other donors and trying to secure additional
financing for its continued operation. This component will be subject to a comprehensive assessment
after it has been operational for one year and during the mid-term review. During both reviews the
PSSF's concept, operational parameters and effectiveness will be evaluated and appropriate modifications
proposed accordingly.



-30-
Intitutional   ngheni
4.35         Improvements of institutional capabilities will be financed under the project for an
estimated amount of about US$2 million. Half of this financing (US$1 million) will be allocated to the
Ministry of Commerce and Industry finance short- and long-term consultants, including a team of experts,
and the training and equipment requirements. To address the need to rationalize and coordinate various
technical assistance projects, the Government requested that IDA fund a team of experts to help
implement a coherent and comprehensive private sector strategy, to coordinate and optimize the various
donor programs of assistance available to that effect, and to engage in a continuous and effective dialogue
with the private sector to identify and relieve bottlenecks. The team will consist of three full time local
or international (one at most) experts assisted by part-time experts. One of the consultants would head
the team, and thus manage this subcomponent. The experts would be attached to the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry Minister's office and report directly to the Minister. Hiring of at least one
expert, the team leader, who would prepare of the terms of reference, staffing and operating procedure,
is a condition of disbursement (para. 7.4 (ii)) of this component of the project (see Annex 8 for draft
outline of terms of reference).
4.36         The other element of this component will be aimed at supporting the creation of the
Tribunal of Commerce (Annexes 5 and 8). Without this institution the business law reforms will not be
implemented effectively. The operation will support the creation of this Tribunal by providing it with
the necessary funds to purchase office and other equipment, realize a training program and implement
the required automation. The amount of resources required to achieve these objectives is estimated at
US$0.7 million. Finally US$0.3 million will be allocated for BNR and PFI training and assistance (para.
4.23).
V. THE PROPOSED CREDIT AND MAIN FEATURES
A. Amount and Allocation of Funds
5.1          The proposed IDA Credit of US$12 million will be lent to the Government, which would
on-lend the credit component (US$7 million) to BNR, the Central Bank which will act as the Apex
institution. BNR will make the credit component available to Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs)
through a refinancing mechanism. The PFIs will in turn on-lend proceeds of the credit component to
beneficiary private enterprises on terms and conditions described below. The US$2 million institutional
strengthening component will be made available to executing agencies as a grant. The Government will
allocate US$1.5 million, which final private beneficiaries will receive as a grant.
B. Terms and Conditions of Finandng
Terms and Conditions of Subloan Refinancing
5.2          The Government and BNR will enter into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement by which the
Government will pass on the proceeds of the credit component to BNR at a regularly revised interest rate
corresponding to the average yield over the previous three months, of 12-month deposits in the banking
system. The 12-month deposit rate is a proxy for the cost of medium term funds to financial institutions.
It changes periodically but, as of June 30, 1993, stood at 9 percent. Currently the rediscount and



-31-
minimum deposit rates are fixed at 11 and 9 percent respectively. Once the proposed system of Treasury
Bill Auction Market, currently under study, is operational, a new reference rate based on that market will
be determined. This rate could, with the agreement of the Government and BNR, replace the 12-month
deposit reference rate. BNR will make proceeds of the credit component available to PFIs at the same
reference rate, but will retain from the interest charges repaid to the Government an administrative fee
of one percent of the outstanding subloans refinanced under the credit component to compensate it for
costs incurred for the execution of the project through its Monetary Policy Department (DPM). That fee
is expected to be sufficient, but would be reviewed periodically in case it is demonstrated that it no longer
covers the legitimate operating costs of the DPM.
5.3         In view of the currently prevailing single digit inflation rate, estimated at an annual rate
of 8 percent as of end December 1992, and the Government's demonstrated commitment to maintain
flexible exchange rate as well as interest rate policies, the proposed rate of refinancing, under the credit
component, charged to PFIs, will closely approximate the international cost of comparable foreign
exchange resources. The foreign exchange risk will accordingly be borne by the Government which will
be compensated by the interest paid by BNR. The IDA-financed subloans will be reimbursed both by
PFIs and their borrowers in local currency, unless IDA and the Government otherwise agree.
Intermediaries will be free to charge final beneficiaries up to the currently agreed temporary maximum
lending rates. Such rates, the rediscount rate and the minimum 12-month deposit rates may be revised,
from time to time, by BNR and agreed with IDA and the IMF. When interest rates are fully liberalized
as expected, during 1994, the final lending rate will be free. During negotiations, the Government
confirmed these policies and agreed to adjust future interest rates as necessary to ensure that they remain
positive in real terms (para. 7.2 (iii)). Signature of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between BNR and
the Government is a condition of effectiveness of the Credit (para. 7.3).
5.4          Under the credit component the Government and BNR on-lending rates would be
reviewed at least every 12 months. Such rates would be modified by agreement between IDA and the
Government, as necessary, to ensure that they continue to compensate the Government adequately for
assuming the foreign exchange risk, and that they reflect the cost of foreign exchange and local resources
for financial intermediaries and subborrowers.
5.5          BNR will receive IDA funds for a period of 20 years, including five years of grace
starting after the date of Credit effectiveness. BNR would reimburse the funds to the Government in
fifteen equal annual installments starting five years after the effectiveness of the Credit. Funds relent
under the credit component to participating intermediaries would be denominated in local currency, with
the same maturities as the individual subloans to final beneficiaries. Maturities of subloans to final
beneficiaries would be limited to a maximum of thirteen years, including grace periods of up to three
years.
5.6          Because of the scarcity of equity finance, subloans granted under the line of credit would
finance up to 80 percent of the total project cost (excluding land) for extension/rehabilitation subprojects,
and up to 70 percent for new subprojects. Promoters would thus be required to finance a minimum of
20 percent of subproject cost for extensions and 30 percent of subproject cost for new projects and not
to exceed a maximum debt to equity structure of 2.33:1. Unless the Association otherwise agrees, the
maximum size of any subloan would be limited to US$900,000 for all subprojects to ensure a greater
number of credit beneficiaries. Commitments under the subloan component are expected to last through
June 30, 1998.



-32-
Private Sector Support Fund
5.7          The $2.5 million Credit proceeds allocated to the PSSF will be available as a grant of the
Government. The PSSF will provide matching grants to private promoters to finance the cost of short
term consulting services (lasting from a few days to less than a month). Private sector enterprises,
including parastatals with majority private ownership and management but excluding large firms or those
with significant foreign ownership (para. 4.33(f)), and promoters will be eligible to receive matching
grants as many times as required, but on a declining scale basis (para. 4.33 (b)) and for cumulative
consulting fees not to exceed US$100,000 per beneficiary company. Private promoters will also benefit
from specialized training seminars for which they will pay a nominal fee, which would cover about 10
percent of training costs. Beneficiaries, with the help of the fund management if required, would be
expected to submit a short but clear description of their problems and proposed intervention and the
expertise required in the form of standardized terms of reference. Once approved, beneficiaries would
hire qualified experts, sign an agreement that the grants are used for the purposes intended, and agree
to provide the fund's management with information required for monitoring the impact of the
interventions. Commitments under the PSSF component are expected to last through December 31, 1997.
Institutional Strengthening
5.8          Funds allocated for the institutional strengthening component would be passed on as a
grant from the Government to relevant institutions and would be available for commitment until
December 31, 1997. The component would be managed by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and
the DPM. These institutions would review requests for financing before submitting them to IDA for
approval along with a brief justification and description of the qualification of the experts, and would also
process disbursement requests.
C. Project Managenent. Monitoring and Evaluation
5.9          Managemnt. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry will be responsible for overall
project coordination under the PSSF and institutional strengthening components, except in the case of
BNR assistance. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry also will be responsible for the coordination
of the mid-term review, as well as of policy discussions and follow-up with other ministries and executing
agencies, e.g., Ministry of Justice (Tribunal of Commerce), Ministry of Finance, and BNR. The
Department of Monetary Policy of BNR will be implementing the credit component and the institutional
strengthening subcomponent for which it is a beneficiary.
5.10         Review of PSSF's first year's operations. A special review of the PSSF will be conducted
after it has been operating for one year. The continuation of IDA support to this fund will depend on
satisfactory results, particularly with respect to the effectiveness of services delivered to private firms.
This review will draw on a direct assessment by IDA, complemented by periodic reports presented by
the fund's management and the independent operational audits (para. 5.25).
5.11         Mid-Term Review. In order to test the effectiveness of new project management and
execution procedures, a mid-term review of project progress will be undertaken (para. 7.5 (v)). This
review will focus in particular, on impediments to enterprise creation, including administrative regulations
for land titles, building permits and other project implementation features. The mid-term review would
be initiated on or about July 31, 1995. The review would be a joint exercise with the Government, to
be undertaken with the cooperation of the institutions concerned, including the Tribunal of Commerce,



-33 -
the PSSF, BNR and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. No later than one month prior to the
Review, the Government would furnish a sufficiently detailed report covering areas to be agreed upon
with IDA, including an evaluation of the progress in project implementation. The basic reference
documents of such a review mission will be the policy matrix of private sector development, as well as
other agreed credit and project documents. The general scope, staffing, and timing of the review will
be agreed with the Government.
5.12         The joint Bank/Government mid-term review will: (a) review project progress with
respect to institutional and policy reforms as well as monitorable targets listed below (paras. 5.13-14);
and (b) agree on an action program, if necessary, for implementing additional policy measures, analytical
studies as the basis for future reforms, and additional institutional reforms and strengthening measures.
The participating IDA review mission will summarize conclusions and recommended actions for
addressing outstanding issues in a detailed aide-memoire. Implementing agencies would be responsible
for follow-up to be reviewed by subsequent supervision missions. During negotiations, agreement was
reached with the Government to undertake the mid-term review by July 31, 1995, with significant
government participation and analytical input, and that recommended actions agreed during the review
would be implemented in consultation with IDA (para 7.5(v)).
5.13         Monitorable Targets. Key project indicators will be used to monitor implementation and
to assess whether developmental objectives are met. These indicators are both global (commitments and
disbursement under various components) and specific. In some cases specific prior targets will be set,
while in others the absence of appropriate past benchmark will render setting up-front objectives difficult.
In the context of mid-term review further key indicators will be developed on the basis of actual
experience.
5.14         The following key project indicators have been developed and agreed to with the
Government:
(a)    Project Implementatlon. The Credit is expected to be effective three months after
Board presentation and all disbursement conditions (paras. 7.3-4) should be met at the
latest another three months thereafter. As slow disbursements have been a problem in
Rwanda in the past, they will be monitored and assessed according to the expected
schedule. In particular the Credit should be fully disbursed by June 30, 1999 and at least
by 25 percent by mid-term review.
(b)    Policy Objectives. The overall timetable for the policy reform objectives is set in para.
7.5 and will be monitored. In the case of business law and labor reforms a number of
key intermediate steps have been identified (Annexes 6-B and 7) and their timely
completion will be followed during project implementation.
(c)    Supply Response. The absence of an appropriate benchmark makes it difficult to assess
the strength of supply response. Key indicators to be followed include: (a) incorporation
of new enterprises or new individual firms on a quarterly basis (commercial registry)
including a target of one industry employing over 20 people and five importers per
quarter; (b) number of firms to be granted free-zone status and which start operation (one
per year, exporting over US$500,000 would be considered a satisfactory target); (c) the
number and distribution of firms, by type, location, and size, which use the PSSF; and
(d) a mount and types of investments financed by banks, other than housing.



-34-
(d)    Administrative Delays.  One objective of the policy reforms and institutional
strengthening is to eliminate needless delays. The following will be monitored: (a)
settlement of all outstanding banking disputes by June 30, 1997, with at least 200 cases
being resolved during the first and second year of the project, and, once the bacldog is
cleared, new cases should be adjudicated or settled within eight months after being filed;
(b) export compensation should be granted within one month of request being made; and
(c) Ministry of Commerce and Industry should respond in writing to private sector
complaints and requests within two months of receiving them.
(e)   Institutional Strengthening. The purchase of about 90 percent of the office and
computer equipment required by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and Tribunal
of Commerce should be completed a year after Credit effectiveness. Computerized
programs for the commercial registry and guarantee registration should be implemented
at the Tribunal of Commerce by June 30, 1995. By mid-1994 the Ministry of Commerce
and Industry should have created a comprehensive bibliography and brief assessment of
all studies and donor projects related to private sector development, which will be
updated thereafter.
(f)    Training Prograns. Training programs are envisaged under the PSSF and institutional
strengthening components. In the case of the former, at least 75 and S0 promoters, from
large scale to micro entrepreneurs, should participate during the first and second year.
PSSF management will provide qualitative assessment of the impact of the seminars.
Within the first year after Credit effectiveness a training program should be devised by
the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Tribunal of Commerce, and BNR and begin to
be implemented. Such training should be completed by the mid-term review.
5.1S         Monitori  and Evaluation.  Progress reports on the execution of the vaious
subcomponents will be prepared and submitted quarterly by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry as
regard the policy component for private sector (summary of activities, use of project funds,
implementation plan and progress of studies planned, and reforms under process, etc.). The DPM of
BNR and the PSSF management will submit six-monthly progress reports to IDA summarizing problems
encountered in the course of executing the components and progress in implementation.
5.16         A project completion report (PCR), the content and format of which to be agreed upon
with IDA, would be submitted to IDA within six months after the project closing date of June 31, 1999.
BNR's Department of Monetary Policy and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will prepare this PCR
in close cooperation with the other project units.
D. IDA Supervislon
5.17         The Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Ministry of Justice (Tribunal of Commerce),
and BNR will require intensive support and training during the initial stages of project implementation.
Particular emphasis will be put on further, and timely, training in procurement and disbursement, as well
as onvironmental safeguard procedures for subproject under the Apex component. The Tribunal of
Commerce, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the PSSF will require training in these areas,
to be provided through the DPM and Resident Mission by Bank staff and by consultants. In view of the
many technical assistance components of the project, intensive supervision (an average of 17 staff weeks
anmnully) will be required during the first three years and about 7 staffweeks thereafter. Detailed IDA
supervision plans into key activities are given in Annex 11.



-35-
E. Procurewment Amngunb
5.18         Credit ComnnL. Subloan free limit is set at US$900,000 (para. 4.30). Procurement
for subprojects financed under the credit component will be made on the basis of procurement procedures
consistent with Bank's Procurement Guidelines, and agreed with the participating financial institutions.
These procedures will require intenational shopping for contracts of US$750,000 or below for each
beneficiary, on the basis of at least three quotations from reputable suppliers in at least two different
geographical areas. Contracts for goods above US$750,000 per subproject, which at this stage are not
anticipated to be many, will be subject to international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures, in
accordance with Bank's Procurement Guidelines. A statement to this effect will be included in the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and BNR.
5.19         Institutional Strengthening and the PSSF. Procurement of equipment and material
(including vehicles, office equipment, computers) will be made through local or international shopping
procedures in accordance with Bank's Procurement Guidelines, on the basis of at least three quotations
from reputable suppliers. Selection of consultants will be made in accordance with Bank's Guidelines
on the Use of Consultants. In the case of the PSSP the promoter will have access to a consultant roster,
and will be able to propose the consultant, which will be approved by the Fund (Annex 5). Moreover,
in order to ensure that the PSSF's funds are used for the purposes they were intended, the consulting
services to promoters will be hired and paid by the fund.
5.20         Problems caused by cumbersome government procurement procedures have been
responsible for poor project implementation and slow disbursement rates in other IDA Credits. The
Government is taking steps to correct these problems with the help of the Bank. Greater emphasis is now
being put on training of project management staff, which will be provided under the project, and IDA
supervision efforts. Moreover, a Country Procurement Assessment Mission, scheduled for FY94, is
expected to focus on improving the procurement procedures.
5.21         Under the line of credit component, prior review of procurement documents will be
required for contracts of US$750,000 and above. The institutional strengthening component will be
executed by three different project entities and individual consultancy contracts are not expected to exceed
US$100,000. Procurement of vehicles, desk computers and other office equipments will likewise be
through small contracts below US$50,000 aggregating to amounts not to exceed US$130,000, to be
awarded under international or local shopping procedures. For components other than the line of credit,
contracts for goods and services above a threshold of US$80,000 will be subject to prior review
procedures. A summary of the procurement methods is presented in Table 5.1 below.

5.23         The Credit disbursement schedule is based on the relevant disbursment profile for
industrial development and finance projects in Africa, taking into account the particularly difficult project
implementation environment of a country like Rwanda. t is expected that the investment component
would be disbursed in five and a half years and the other components over five years, taking into account
expected improvement in the capacity for project appraisal, financing approval, nd implemontation.
Funds under the credit component would be available for commitment until Docember 31, 1998.
Disbursements would be completed by June 30, 1999, the proposed closing date.
5.24         Special Accounts. To expedite disbursement of funds, three Special Accounts for the
DPM of BNR, the PSSF and Ministry of Commerce and Industry will be set up in a financial institution
acceptable to IDA, into which IDA would make initial estimated deposits totalling US$500,000,
US$200,000, and US$100,000, respectively, from the Credit immediately after effectiveness. Thes
amounts reflect the estimated requirements for operating costs, equipment procurement and consultant
services, for a three to four month period. In parallel, as a condition of disbursement of the PSSF (para.
7.4 (iii)), the Government will deposit in a project account counterpart funds of RwFl.5 million.
Applications for replenishment of the special accounts will be submitted on a monthly basis. The Special
Accounts and associated statements of expenditures (SOEs) will be audited annually by independent
auditors, except in the case of the PSSF where bi-yearly audits will be undertaken during the first two
years of operation. The audit reports would submitted to IDA within six months of the end of the fiscal
year, or an agreed mid-year date in the case of the PSSF. Disbursements for expenditures for all
contracts for goods and services or individual items under US$50,000 will be made on the basis of



-38-
statements of expenditures. Tho documentation for withdrawals made under SOEs will be retained by
the DPM on behalf of other project units involved (i.e., for sites and services, and other technical
assistance units) for ten years and will be reviewed by Bank supervision missions. All other
disbursements will be made on the basis of fully documented applications.
5.25         Auditing and Reporting. Audit requirements for all ongoing IDA Credits in industry,
finance and PE sectors have been met. The DPM and other project units will have their accounts, as well
as the Special Accounts and SOEs audited annsally by independent auditors acceptable to IDA and will
frnish to IDA certified copies of their audied accounts together with the corresponding management
letters within six months of the end of the fiscal year. The DPM will submit to IDA quarterly and annual
progress reports (including financial and budgetary accounts) on the technical assistance and the
investment components. Furthermore, the DPM will review the annual audits of Participating Financial
Intermediaries and inform IDA of the conclusions of such audit reviews. Finally, to avoid possible
misuse, the PSSF will be subject to bi-yearly operational audits including review of procedures and
impact on client enterprises, during the first two years of operations.
5.26         Estimated Proect Costs and Financing Plan. Total project costs are estimated at
USS19.25 million equivalent, of which US$12.75 million equivalent (66 percent) would be in foreign
exchange. A summary of the project costs and expected financing are given in the table 5.2 below:

VI. PROJECT JUSICATION AND RISKS
6.1         Benefits.  The proposed operation is a complement to Rwanda's macr-economic
adjustment program already launched with Bank and IMF support. The project would help spur private
investment and assist Rwanda achieve its growth objectives. Major expected benefits would stem from
an enhanced supply response by private sector investors, which would create the employment
opportunities that are critical for supporting the consolidation of the peace process and public sector
retrenchment from productive activities. The project is expected to contribute to the achievement of these
objectives by providing long-term credit, helping private firms become better managed and more
competitive, and strengthening institutions responsible for ensuring the creation of a fully liberalized
business environment, including freedom to create and operate an enterprise, and a reliable legal system
guaranteeing transparent enforcement of contractual agreements between lenders and borrowers In
particular. By supporting effective monetary and credit policies, and promoting better managed banking
institutions, the project would improve their capacity for increased resource mobilization, and diversified
and expanded financing of private sector investment.
6.2          Risa. The Government of Rwanda is currently undertaking a series of major political
and economic reforms designed to lead to greater national unity and opening-up the political system,
while maintaining the thrust of the economic adjustment process, and liberalization of the legal and
regulatory environment. The main risk associated with the project relates to the emphasis given to
ensuring political stability, which could delay the Government's policy reform program and slow down
the process of revamping the legal and regulatory framework. This could mean that the implementation



-40-
of a well focused private sector development strategy could be lengthy, thereby the pace of private sector
investment to be slower than expected. These risks have been considerably mitigated by the recent
August 4, 1993 signing of the peace agreement ending the military conflict within Rwanda. A risk
associated with recent military expenditure would be the monetization of the fiscal deficit which would
lead to high inflation and crowd out the private sector. The likelihood of this problem becoming severe
is mitigated by the fact that the Government has a long record for fiscal prudence which can be seen in
the fact that in the past 20 years inflation in Rwanda has rarely reached double-digit figures. These risks
will be monitored closely in the context of implementation of the adjustment program, and through an
assessment to be undertaken during the mid-term review of project implementation planned for July 1995.
Furthermore, the consensus built around the need for effective reform of the business environment, the
Government's desire to return to its traditional fiscal prudence and the strong voice of a rapidly emerging
private sector should ensure the effective implementation of the project.
6.3          Environmental Impact. Another type of risk is environmental, associated with the possible
establishment of polluting industries under the Apex component. While the exact nature of subprojects
to be financed are not known, the level of Rwanda's industrial development and its comparative advantage
suggests that most subloans would be mainly small- and medium-size, without significant environmental
impact. In May 1991, Rwanda adopted a National Environmental Action Plan, which has been discussed
with IDA. This plan includes a classification scheme and regulations for industries, and the Ministry of
Public Works is responsible for ensuring compliance when delivering building and operations permits.
In any event, BNR will be responsible for sensitizing PFIs and subborrowers in this area, and for
screening subprojects to ensure that environmental aspects are covered adequately in the appraisal (paras.
4.26 and 4.28). In cases where subprojects likely to present environmentally hazardous pollution
problems are identified, an environmental test would be developed in agreement with IDA and an
acceptable mitigation plan would be required.
VII. AGREEMENTS AND UNDERSTANDINGS REACHED
7.1          During project preparation and appraisal, the following has been implemented or
agreed upon by the Government, mostly in connection with the adjustment program:
(i)    Simplification of regulations for business creation and operation, elimination of redundant
procedures and controls, and of prior approval of Ministry of Commerce and Industry
with respect to enterprise creation, relocation of the commercial registry to the courts

RWANDESE REPUBLIC
Statement of Private Sector Development Policy
I. Introduction
1.           Rwanda's economic performance during the 1970s was relatively satisfactory, with an
average annual growth rate of 5 percent. However, from the early 1980s the economy began to show
signs of difficulties. The cause was, largely, a financial crisis resulting from the worsening terms of
trade, which was exacerbated by the continued decline in coffee prices after 1987. These macroeconomic
problems underscored the poor performance of the industrial and services sectors, in which the private
sector had yet to play a leading role. At the same time, the scarcity of arable land made it evident that
the agricultural sector could not continue its role as a provider of jobs and engine of economic growth
beyond the short to medium term; and that every effort should therefore be made to foster development
of export oriented industry and services by encouraging the private sector to take the lead in that process.
2.           It was in this context that Rwanda, determined to tackle its challenging development
problems, began in 1990 to take steps to restructure its economy. Those measures were implemented
despite the difficulties triggered by the armed opposition. This effort, bolstered by support and financial
assistance from the international community, was crystallized in the adoption of a structural adjustment
program. The program's objectives are to put the economy back on a solid footing in order to increase
the incomes and raise the living standards of the population. Certain key elements have been identified
in advance as essential in achieving those objectives. One of the most important of which is increased
private sector contribution to economic growth to be realized through substantially greater investments
in profitable activities-particularly those involving exports-and more efficient use of existing production
factors. This strategy will be bolstered by the return of peace accompanied by political opening and the
launching of a democratization process designed to ensure that the entire population participates in the
country's economic and political life.
3.           To finance the economic program and support the implementation of measures promoting
the private sector, a structural adjustment program was agreed on with IDA in June 1991. The purpose
of this initial program-which was also backed by the International Monetary Fund-was to improve the
macroeconomic environment. Another two complementary credits are also being prepared. Their
objectives will be adjustment of the agricultural and financial sectors, in order to strengthen the strategy
adopted in the Structural Adjustment Program. Two additional operations complete the private sector
reform program; the first, a project to reform public enterprises supported by an IDA Credit since 1990,
is designed to make public companies more productive by privatizing and restructuring them, and
exposing them to competition with the private sector. The second, the private sector promotion project,
seeks to create a business climate that will nurture the sector's development, support its investment effort
and help to improve its skills, thus enabling the private sector to make better use of its production tools.
The purpose of the present letter is to provide a detailed description of the sectoral policy framework and
the measures to be addressed under this project.
II. The Private Sector Development Stratey
4.           Aside from farming and stockraising, which employ more than 90 percent of Rwanda's
population, private activity in the industrial, trade and other service sectors is not very important.
According to current statistics, the 130 companies in the modem industrial sector produce 8 percent of



- 45 -                                          Annex I
Page 2 of 7
the GDP and employ 15,000 persons. Only half of that output comes from privately-owned firms, the
rest is produced by state-owned or mixed companies. There is also an informal sector, which is active
in cottage industries, mining and different types of maintenance and repairs. This relatively dynamic
sector consists of about 700 micro-enterprises and several thousand individuals. The trade sector
comprises roughly a hundred importing companies of various sizes, but only about ten specialized
exporters. Otherwise, the private sector operators are to be found mainly in the transport subsector,
where they operate 1,900 trucks and 1,300 minibuses, and in the consulting business. There are a dozen
or so advisory service companies and about one hundred independent experts. In all, private production
in the industrial sector and services contribute to only about 15 percent of the GDP.
5.           Despite its weak base, private sector production-particularly in trade and industry-grew
rapidly in the 1970s and early 1980s. The growth was mainly due to an import-substitution strategy
calling for the creation of industrial companies, some with low economic viability, plus relatively easy
access to foreign exchange at attractive rates which encouraged the development of import activities. This
strategy reached its limitations in the mid-80s, partly because of the lack of foreign exchange and the
restricted opportunities for profitable investment aimed solely at the domestic market-which is restricted
by the population's low purchasing power-but also because of the lack of a new policy that would
encourage export activities and improve the business climate.
6.           In view of the situation, the Government's new strategy for developing the private sector
consists of simultaneously addressing the various problems inhibiting such development. The main
features of that strategy are:
(i)   implementation of a stable and enabling macroeconomic framework designed to eliminate
the observed distortions. The main measures include stabilization and reduction of the
budget deficit, opening of the domestic economy to internal and external competition, and
exchange rate and price liberalization.
(ii)    Adoption and implementation of sectoral strategies in the areas of agriculture, finance,
public enterprises, and private industry and service. The thrust of the actions will be to
establish a transparent and well-devised labor and business, legal and regulatory
framework, a more even-handed tax system that does not cause distortion and encourages
private investment, and incentives for exporters. In addition, the play of intersectoral
relations will in turn enable implementation of these sectoral strategies to have a
favorable effect on the other sectors.
(iii)   Supporting private investment in profitable activities of the economy and assistance to
newly established companies-or those in the process of rehabilitation-to help them
improve the conception of their investment projects and ensure the sound basis thereof,
and to stimulate and assist the companies so they can make a determined effort to
improve their efficiency and productivity.
(iv)   Strengthening of the institutions responsible for executing and following up on the
sectoral strategy and carrying out ancillary measures.
7.            Implementation of this liberal strategy thus calls for adoption of a new approach, one that
creates a nurturing environment for restructuring the private sector and enables it to grow on a sound
basis, while attacking the structural constraints faced by the various sectors involved. The fundamental
components of this approach are already an integral part of the Government's Structural Adjustment

Program; and its principal goals consist of: librlization of domestic economic activities; enabling local
production to compete with imports; nd cOming new drect stae investment in productive and trade
activities while progressively discontinuing its participation in those sectors.

8.           Despite the country's difficulties, Rwanda took steps to improve the macroeconomic
situation, open up foreign trade, liberalize prices, and increase sta  revenues. The measures already
in effect include: adoption of an exchange rate policy that makes Rwanda's currency more competitive
(devaluation in foreign exchange terms of 40 porcent in 1990 and 15 percent in 1992); an increase in the
interest rates to make them positive in real terms; elimination of customs duties on exports, except for
coffee; the substitution of tariffs for nontriff barries; a review of indirect taxation with the adoption of
a new tariff code lowering the maximum to 100 percent and raising the minimum to 10 percent); and
almost doubling the turnover tax to 10 percent.
9.           The reforms and liberalizaton dforts are continuing, and the Government is committed
to taking other measures, particularly an open goneral licensing system for import plus a further cut in
the maximum tariff rate on import, thereby bringn k down to 80 percent. Despite the steps taken to
increase revenues, however, it hs not yet been pousible to balance the budget owing to higher expenses
than anticipated. Efforts are thus concentrated on reducing the fiscal deficit. Adoption of a prudent
monetary policy, has nevertheless brought inflation under control (about 9 percent in 1992). The
macroeconomic framework thus meets the necessary condition for enabling the development of the private
sector.
Agricultural Sector Refbrm
10.          Agriculture is Rwanda's most importnt ativity. This sector accounts for 40 percent
of the GDP and employs more than 90 percent of the ecowmically ctive population. It is thus a vital
foundation for the economy since, on the one hand, any increase in Uricultural revenue boosts the
demand for industrial products and service; and, on the other, the sector furnishes many of the inputs
needed by industry and generates more than 90 percent of the foreign exchange used by the private
sector. Agricultural development is therefore a mainstay of tht sector.
11.          To help realize its potential, the program for adjustment of the agriculture sector calls for
a series of measures including: (a) adoption of a regulatory framework in which private agents can
respond freely to market forces; and (b) privaizaton of the proceuing, production and marketing of
coffee, tea and rice.
Financial Sector Reform
12.          The purpose of financial sector reform is to make the sector more competitive and
encourage it to offer financial instruments tailored to meet the needs of a  pdern economy. In the
context of a liberal economy, this sector will have to play a more activoe raolem attracting savings and
financing investment. To that end, Interest rates have been increased so that they outstrip inflation and
are thus positive in real terms.



- 47 -                                          Annex I
Page 4 of 7
13.          These initial measures are only the first in the series. Over the next two years, other
basic reforms will be undertaken in the financial sector, namely: (a) adoption of a monetary and credit
policy in which BNR control will be applied indirectly, through such instruments as rediscounting rates
and the introduction of a compulsory reserve system for banks; (b) strengthening of the sector's
regulatory framework through enactment of a new banking law and revision of BNR by-laws so that they
will clarify the role of the central bank in the monitoring of institutions and conduct of the monetary
policy; and (c) institutional strengthening of BNR and restructuring or liquidation of financial institutions-
especially BNR, the Caisse d'Epargne (savings bank) and the Caisse hypothecaire (housing bank)-plus
rationalization of the operating rules governing the Fonds Special de Garantie (Special Guarantee Fund),
with a view to streamlining its management and making its operations more efficient.
Restructuring of Public Enterprises
14.          Reform of public enterprise has been one of the key elements in the Government's
economic strategy since 1990. Its goals are to: (a) allow the private sector to take part in activities
heretofore reserved for the state, such as energy, water and telecommunications services and other areas
in which the state has always had a leading role (such as tea, coffee, and banking); (b) make existing
companies as efficient as possible in order to secure a return on past investment-or at least lighten the
heavy load such companies place on the budget; and (c) orchestrate suitable means enabling the public
sector to ensure adequate monitoring of such activities as the university, the Office of information of
Rwanda and others which would appear to be destined for a permanent place in its portfolio.
15.          A necessary prerequisite for carrying out that strategy is the existence of a suitable
framework based on two complementary measures. First, a new framework-law will be enacted to give
the heads of companies more autonomy, at the same time making them responsible for successes or
failures. It will also review the legal framework of state-owned corporations with a view to facilitating
their restructuring or possible privatization, as well as to clarify the functions that are to be performed
by the various control bodies. The law has already been adopted by the cabinet and will soon be
submitted to the Parliament. Second, to endow its reform process with greater transparency, the
Government plans to announce its general strategy for privatizing or restructuring each of the existing
corporations. Since the baseline study has now been completed, the detailed strategy will be put in place
during 1993.
16.          Reform of public enterprises will thus enter an active stage of privatization and
restructuring in 1993. To expedite the process as much as possible, a number of specific steps were
taken in 1992. As a result, five companies-including Sonatubes and Rwantexco-have now been
privatized or liquidated. Other important areas have already been identified as the target of immediate
reforms.  They include the tea and coffee sectors (which are slated for privatization), the
telecommunications sector (partial privatization) and the energy sector (in which Electrogaz will be placed
under private management). Finally, state-owned corporations will no longer be entitled to exemption
from various taxes, and will be responsible for paying their debts.
IV. Measures to Support Development of the Private Sector
17.          Promotion of the private sector requires the implementation of concrete action based on
the following pivotal points, summarized also in the policy matrix attached to this letter:



- 48 -                                         Annex 1
Page 5 of 7
(i)    Creation of a favorable environment by means of a sectoral policy designed to remove
the fiscal, legal and regulatory constraints, including those associated with the tax,
commercial and labor codes-a policy that provides also incentives for export.
(ii)   Support for private investment through an Apex line of credit that makes long-term
resources available to the financial sector.
(iii)  Improvement of the sector's performance by ensuring access to the services of local or
foreign experts so that it can make better use of the production tool placed at its service.
It has been decided to set up a private sector support fund for that purpose.
(iv)   Institutional strengthening-particularly of the institutions responsible for carrying out the
sectoral policy-to ensure the effective implementation of these measures.
Technical and material support are needed to attain those objectives, and will be provided in part by the
Private Sector Development Project.
InDrovement of the Legal and Regulatory Framework
18.          Steps already taken by the Govermnent include:
(i)    easing of the formalities for setting up industrial units by eliminating the advance
authorization heretofore required from the ministry responsible for industry.
(ii)    Revision of the law on trade registry to eliminate the requirement for advance
authorization from the ministry in charge of commercial affairs for engaging in industry
and trade. This has been replaced by a declaration at the commercial registry at the court
of first instance.
(iii)   A study of the commercial code as a basis for drawing up a plan of action to overhaul
legislation on business activities.
(iv)   A study of the labor code and adoption of a plan of action to eliminate any distortions
identified therein.
19.          In the coming years, the Government is committed to ensure implementation of the
reforms for which a plan of action has been established and, as noted below, to strengthen the judiciary
system by creating a Tribunal of Commerce, nominating its President, and adopting its rules and
procedures at latest by June 30, 1994. The priority steps to be taken in 1993 and 1994 would be in
connection with the commercial laws and regulations, subject to a detailed plan of action. The major
changes include: revision of the law governing the organization of trading companies; clarification of
certain provisions concerning commercial registry; revision of the statutory provisions relative to
commercial paper and real property, guarantees and sureties, collateral, negotiations (sale, exchange,
leasing etc.); amendment of the law on bankruptcy; and the creation of commercial jurisdictions
(administrative and judiciary sections, including a Tribunal of Commerce and auxiliaries of justice).
20.           The study of the labor code has identified obstacles to smooth functioning of the labor
market due to: (a) the lack of flexibility in the rules on hiring and firing; (b) the minimum wage scales
for each category of workers, which increases the cost of labor; and (c) costly nonwage compensation



- 49 -                                       Annex 1
Page 6 of 7
(the high cost of overtime, too few days of actual work, and the payment of medical expenses). The
result of these rules is that the Rwandese worker costs too much compared to its productivity. The
measures set forth in the plan of action are designed to liberalize the hiring and licensing procedures in
cases where they are justified; to lower the payroll costs by setting a single minimum wage; and to
increase the number of work days.
Corporate Tax System
21.          With assistance from an expert from the IMF, the Ministry of Finance has identified the
key measures needed for a fiscal reform aimed at establishing a system that is economically neutral and
attractive to investment. One of the chief purposes of this reform is to introduce provisions in the tax
code whereby accelerated amortization and legal reevaluation of balance sheets would obviate the need
for recourse to the investment code. Given the budget deficit, the immediate reforms should be neutral.
The measures targeted for implementation in 1993 include: (a) repeal of the tax on distribution
(dividends); (b) acceptance of accelerated amortization and legal reevaluation of balance sheets for tax
exemption purposes; (c) the introduction of tax-deductible items for banks; and (d) conversion of the
turnover tax (ICHA-imp6t sur le chiffre d'affaires) to a value-added tax.
22.          Beyond the immediate horizon, strengthening of the Ministry of Finance tax department
will permit a significant broadening of the tax base and an increase in revenue. It will then be easier in
1994 and 1995 to introduce other tax reforms which today would not be revenue-neutral. The two most
important steps to this end are: (a) a two-stage reduction of corporate taxes, cutting them to 40 and 30
percent; and (b) extension of the right to deduct payments made to other financial institutions for the
production sector.
Promotion of Exprts
23.          It is clear that nontraditional exports will be developed primarily thanks to an accrued
domestic production capacity, and that immediate results cannot be expected. Certain conditions fostering
exports have not yet been met, however, and three important steps have been identified. First, the 1991
export promotion law calls for the exporter to be given a tax credit equivalent to 10 percent of the value
of his exports to compensate for the various taxes paid in the course of production. This measure has
not yet been put into effect, but will be applied in 1993. Secondly, to encourage investments-probably
in partnership with foreigners- more than 90 percent of which are allocated for exports or to permit
reexports, a free zone system will be set up in 1994.
24.          Finally, it has been observed that most of the nontraditional exports are shipped by air.
Therefore, the regulatory system will be reviewed to increase the availability of air transport services and
improve their quality. In this context, the roles played by the Ministry of Transport, the airport
administration, and Air Rwanda will be revised.
Support for Investment
25.          Investment financing is constrained by two factors. First, despite short term liquidities,
the financial sector-except for the development bank-lacks long-term funds. As a result, banks' ability
to finance investment is constrained. To ease that problem and stimulate competition among financial
institutions, long-term resources will be made available to the sector. The second constraint is the



- 50 -                                     Annex 1
Page 7 of 7
ineffectiveness of the guarantee mechanisms. Establishment of a Tribunal of Commerce should partially
resolve that problem. In addition, the regulations governing the special guarantee fund are about to be
revised so that it can effectively ensure the successful outcome of the operations covered by its guarantee.
Private Sector Support Fund
26.          The lack of know-how at the corporate level frequendy results in wasted resources due
to inefficient utilization of the production apparatus. That problem has been recognized for some time
now, and has led to a number of projects supported by donors who have opened consulting offices and
other institutions engaged in aid to the private sector. Those efforts are thus devoted mainly to creating
a supply of advisory services. To complement this approach, a fund for assistance to the private sector
will be installed on a pilot basis in the Bank of Kigali. Its objective will be to create a demand for
consulting services, by organizing seminars at which administrators will be alerted to the constraints
inherent to their enterprises and by covering-up to a certain point and on a gradually decreasing scale-
some of the expenses of the companies, who will choose the qualified expert best suited to their needs.
InsitunalkSgreaning
27.          It is important to see that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is adequately financed
to perform its role of assisting the private sector in regard to: (a) implementation of the measures derived
from the strategy described above; (b) the identification of new constraints; (c) follow-up on and
coordination of the activities designed to help the private sector; and (d) the receipt of and response to
any complaints that may be lodged by the sector. To that end, a technical group-the nucleus of which
will be a team of experts consisting of three nationals and possibly a foreign advisor-will have to be set
up and placed under the supervision of the Ministry. The Ministry will also need sufficient funding to
be able to call on short-term consultancies, purchase the requisite data processing equipment, and train
its professional staff.
28.          Finally, creation of a Tribunal of Commerce has been identified as a priority goal. Its
purpose will be to permit quick resolution of trade disputes-which at present can take as long as five
years. The Tribunal will be a permanent and autonomous structure, chaired by a president who is a
qualified and experienced member of the judiciary. The Tribunal will specialize in the arbitration of
business disputes, and it will be assisted by businessmen who have the required expertise. It will receive
the necessary funds to train its professional staff and purchase the supplies and equipment it needs.
Finally, the continued support to the Chamber of Commerce, which is slated to become a non-profit
organization will have to continue to ensure its sustainability.

RWANDESE REPUBLIC
PRIVATE SECTORDEEOMNPRJC
Review of Management Consulting Services Available in Rwanda
I. Introduction
1.           Sources of management consulting in Rwanda include about 12 enterprises listed as
consulting agents or 'bureau d'etudes", 3 technical assistance centers created by donors and over 130
individuals registered as having specialist expertise and capable of providing consulting services.
Additional important intermediaries include about 10 non governmental organizations, plus a handful of
other institutions including the association of industry, the banks, the chamber of commerce, the
university and several technical schools.
2.           Existing providers of consulting services offer a range of services and have the skills
sufficient to meet the immediate assistance needs of most private sectors operators. There are,
nevertheless, some deficiencies in the range and quality of services locally available such as specialist
technical knowledge. This is expected to develop as the industry evolves and the private sector operators
become more sophisticated in defining their requirements of consulting assistance. The structure of many
of the existing providers is sufficiently flexible to adapt to less common requirements, for example, by
sub-contracting the expertise required for a particular intervention. This developing industry needs to
be reenforced as most of its participants are continuously refining their services/approaches in an effort
to become firmly established in this new market and to improve the quality of their service to meet the
ever increasing needs of the growing private sector.
II. Providers of consulting services
3.           Private consulting firms. The review identified about 12 private firms with varying
capacities to provide consulting services to private sector promoters and enterprises. In an effort to
compete effectively for the limited business available the private firms tend to advertise a broad range
of services, including: (a) a very comprehensive range of accounting and financial services; (b)
management and organizational assistance; (c) feasibility, marketing and technical studies; (d) personnel
and managerial training; and (e) preparation of the Acts of an enterprise, negotiations and conclusions
on commercial contracts. In addition to firms in the general consulting category, there are at least seven
private firms specializing in the data-processing area which offer software training, advice on computer
installation, development of personalized software for clients, and statistical studies/surveys. The bulk
of the business for these private consulting firms comes from one or two of these services categories,
notably accounting work or the completion of studies. In general, private consultant firms interventions
are based on an agreed contract between the parties which precisely define the rights and obligations
thereof While the rates vary according to the nature of the service, typically the private consultant firms
charge upwards of RwF2000 ($16) per man hour (starting at RwF300,000 ($2,400) per month).
4.            Technical Assistance Centers   Three centers offering management consulting and
trouble-shooting services were identified in the review: Serdi, Technoserve and the Center of Services
for the Artisan (CSA). All three centers were set up under donor projects with the specific objective to



- 58 -                                       Anex4
Page 2 of 5
assist the development of a dynamic private sector. Serdi was established in 1989 under an UNDP
project to assist the development of small and medium enterprises through the provision of consulting
services, training and technical assistance etc. Serdi specializes in assisting promoters to materialize their
productive initiatives into bankable projects through the completion of feasibility studies, organizing
finance for training/study tours and facilitating access to bank credit. The future of this center is under
review and its privatization is a likely outcome. Technoserve, a non-profit organization financed by the
USAID from 1986-1991, specializes in trouble shooting services targeted at private enterprises through
the provision of its business advisory services (BAS) involving limited technical assistance interventions,
and its management assistance programs (MAPS) providing long-term comprehensive managerial
assistance. Technoserve also assists the private sector through training programs, business seminars and
the publication of business guides and manuals etc. CSA, a service center funded by the CCCE, was
established in 1991 to provide a comprehensive range of trouble shooting services to small and medium
sized enterprises and artisans. CSA provides assistance on several dimensions including, enterprise
diagnostics, market studies, research into partnership possibilities, materials, training information as such
like. CSA has been set up completely independent of the Rwandan administration and intervenes only
in existing enterprises (i.e., excludes promoters) with high profitability potential. CSA asks an average
of RwF200 ($1.6) per hour for its management consulting services, with the other technical assistance
centers generally demanding a nominal fee of about RwF5000 ($40) for a total service/intervention.
These rates are significantly below those charged by the private sector.
5.            BInks The three commercial banks in Rwanda do not offer any formal system of
consulting services for their clients. In contrast, the Rwandan Bank of Development (BRD) and the
central branch of the Banques Populaires (BP) both have small monitoring units responsible for following
clients progress and to provide management and technical assistance. In both cases this is achieved
through a regular visiting program. The quality and effectiveness of these consulting services are
undermined by the resource constraints of both the BP and BRD. The visits are both very infrequent (in
the case of the BRD rarely more than a single visit per year) and serve primarily to assess the client's
ability to repay the loans rather than to provide technical assistance.
6.            Chamber of Commerce The only type of trouble shooting service provided by the
Chamber of Commerce for its members is in the form of its legal assistance service where the Chamber
will, on occasion, represent the interest of a particular enterprise on some specific problem/delay incurred
in the enterprises dealings with the Administration. Examples would include facilitating the granting of
an importing license, or acquiring permission to set up an enterprise.
7.            Ihe Association of Industries This recently established producer association, does not
provide consulting services on an individual basis to its members but rather represents members' interests
as a whole in the political, social and economic domains. It strives to improve the operating conditions
for the industrial sector and to develop the sector's dialogue with the Authorities. The Association also
monitors proposed legislative and regulatory changes and draws attention to any issues of interest for its
members.
8.            The University and Technical Schools The University and the various technical schools
do not formally provide any form of technical assistance or management consulting services for the
private sector. Approximately 50 individual professors and researchers are registered as consultants in
all areas of expertise, available on a private bases.

9.            The National Office of Studies and Projects (BUNEP). The specific technical services
(e.g., topography) and the financial services (eg. feasibility studies and audits) provided by BUNEP are
structured to meet public sector needs. A restructured and privatized BUNEP could cater more
effectively for private sector needs.
10.           Individual consultants Over 130 individualsl offer their services as consultants in a
diverse range of expertise, including economics, transportation, communications and law. Few of these
individuals are engaged full-time as consultants as the management consulting demand does not warrant
this. This group represents a considerable resource to be drawn upon as the industry evolves and the
private sector demand is heightened. Many of these individual consultants are, or have been, civil
servants and have worked on studies and projects either financed by the Government or international
donors, and by extension with the private sector. Some are occasionally linked to local consultant firms
on a sub-contractor bases.
11.           Non-governmental organizations. At least 10 Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
provide some degree of technical assistance or training for the private sector. The majority of these NGO
services do not cater specifically for private enterprises but are targeted at (i) associations and
cooperatives, usually in an effort to improve the commercialization of their activities (for example, the
Non-governmental Organization "IWACU operates as a national training and research center designed
to provide training and services to cooperatives and to strengthen their management and commercial
activities) or (ii) artisans, often by means of the day to day running of small workshops and the provision
of on-the-job training for artisan. The exception is 'Duterimbere', an NGO which was created to assist
women entrepreneurs to start-up or expand micro- and small- enterprises through the provision of
managerial advice, enterprise diagnostics and facilitating their access to bank credit. Some of the NGOs
focus their activities on re-enforcing the NGO network which provides support and advice to artisans,
micro-enterprises and associations, rather than providing direct assistance themselves. Some of the
NGO's have introduced a system of cost recovery for consulting services, but only symbolic amounts are
involved at this stage.
IH. Assessment of the capadties of providers of consulting service.
12.           The private consulting firms and the technical assistance centers have the greatest
capacities of those reviewed to meet immediate private sector consulting needs, although many are
struggling to become firmly established in the market and reach high quality standards. Some NGOs and
individual consultants are also well placed to assist private sector enterprises and promoters in certain
specialist fields such as energy and transportation, or with specific technical assistance in the areas of
wood/metal working and the production of artisan goods, or for specific sub-groups such as assisting
women entrepreneurs to access bank finance.
13.           A few related factors limit the private consultant firms ability to develop their full
potential to cater effectively for the private sector market, such as their lack of experience in working
with this sector. Typically private sector clients represent only 2-5% of the workload of these private
X  This includes 9 professional individual consultants, 16 burau d'tude officers, 47 academic researhes, 32 civil serva
and 33 officers of other insitutions, who have been identified in the regiAer curntly being prepared by Minisy of Plan
on local expertise.



- 60 -                                     Annex 4
Page 4 of 5
consulting firms, with the bulk of their business coming from the Government and international donors.
This lack of private sector work suggest that private enterprises are not yet used to paying for consulting
assistance, not fully understanding the nature of the services provided by this relatively new consulting
industry and are only beginning to see the potential value of such assistance. It also suggests that private
sector firms do not fully recognize that consulting assistance could help it face up to the difficult
economic situation through productivity gains. Until relatively recently the firms in Rwanda have
operated in a protected environment. This is changing with the deregulation of the economy. In order
to survive in this changed environment, firms will need to operate more effectively than they have in the
past. In many cases a major restructuring of their activities to increase production, managerial and
technical efficiency may be required. At present, many entrepreneurs are solely blaming the poor
economic and political situation for their current difficulties. While this is true to an extent significant
improvement in a firm's operations could be achieved through focussing on internal factors to a firm's
operations rather than such exogenous factors. With further liberalization of the economy and improved
economic performance, the private sector's demand for technical assistance and management consulting
is expected to increase significantly to enhance their productivity and support new investments.
14.          An element of distortion is the virtually free consulting services offered by the technical
assistance centers and NGOs in comparison to the commercial rates charged by the private consulting
firms. This lack of a level playing field makes it difficult for the private consulting firms to compete
effectively for private sector business. This situation is expected to improve slowly, given that the service
centers cannot be sustained with donor subsidies indefinitely. They too will have to operate on a more
commercial basis. Furthermore, as the local industry strengthens the justification for subsidizing the
providers (as distinct from the service) of consulting services will be undermined.
15.          Together the three technical assistance centers offer a broad range of consulting services
in a manner sufficiently flexible to meet the demands of most of the private sector operators. The
centers, not restrained by the need to operate commercially, now have considerable experience working
with small private and promoters. While there is room for improvement in the mode and cost
effectiveness of delivery of the centers services, the on-going modification of their services reflects their
efforts to fine-tune their approaches and services to best meet the requirements of this market. These
centers have also served to increase the publics awareness about the role and value of consulting services.
16.          The most common expertise provided in private sector interventions are of an accounting
and financial nature. Some of the private consulting firms estimate that financial services, especially
auditing, account for over 80% of their business. Similarly, many of interventions provided by technical
assistance centers focus on organizing the enterprises accounting systems and financial declarations,
because (a) the suppliers of technical assistance generally have an accounting background and therefore
a tendency to interpret enterprises needs accordingly; and (b) private entrepreneurs have difficulty in
defining their enterprise's problems and requirements of assistance, with concepts of marketing and
human resource management for example, relatively less understood than accounting. Consequendy
much potential consultant demand is not recognized and left unsatisfied.
17.          Some deficiencies in the range of consultant services locally available is evident, for
example in the area of specialist technical advice on the use of machinery or the selection of appropriate
technology. It is doubtful that, given the small size of the private sector and the fact that many such
technical problems would be 'once-offs', that the availability of such expertise locally would be justified.
Access to foreign expertise or technicians working in similar operations in other countries either through



- 61 -                                     Annex 4
Page 5 of 5
study trips, or visits by experts to Rwanda, is probably a more appropriate way of catering for such needs
while greater local expertise is developed. Many of the private consultant firms and one of the technical
assistance centers pursue a policy of sub-contracting consultants when the intervention required is beyond
their own areas of expertise or capacities. In these circumstances the firms usually draw from a pool of
local free-lance consultants with various skills and specializations. As the demand and requirements of
the private entrepreneurs becomes more sophisticated, the pool of expertise utilized by the local
consulting industry is likely to be extended to include overseas technical experts. CSA already has a
policy of utilizing foreign expertise when it is deemed the most appropriate for the job. Such logical
extension of the pool of consulting resources will help to overcome deficiencies in the local market's
present range of expertise and serve to strengthen the local consulting industry and therefore benefit the
private sector as a whole in the longer-term.
IV. Conclusion
18.          The provision of management consulting services, and particularly the development of
private consulting firms is a relatively new phenomena in Rwanda. Accordingly, this sector is not, as
yet, well established with new firms opening each year and others dropping out of the market. Private
consulting firms' efforts to cater effectively for private sector needs are being frustrated at present by the
competition of donor funded projects which provide virtually free technical assistance and by the private
sector's poor appreciation of the role of consultant firms. The development of a more level playing field
for the consulting industry would help the private consulting firms to develop their full potential in
meeting private sector requirements. Private sector operators also need to be made more aware of their
own shortcomings and how consulting assistance can help them increase their productivity through
enhancing managerial and technical efficiency. Both problems will be alleviated by the creation of the
PSSF proposed by the project.
19.          The providers of consulting services identified in this paper together provide a range of
services and have the skills sufficient to meet the immediate demands of most private sector operators
in Rwanda. Catering for the few deficiencies that currently exist in the range of services locally available
could probably not be justified on a permanent basis in Rwanda due the small size of the private sector.
However, the structure of several of the private firms and the technical assistance centers are sufficiently
flexible to hire external expertise in these limited number of cases where the specialized knowledge is not
locally available. As the consulting industry evolves and the private entrepreneurs become more
sophisticated in recognizing and defining their needs for management consulting assistance, the quality
of local expertise will improve. The need for foreign expertise will probably be heightened as private
entrepreneurs demand more specialized assistance and the PSSF will encourage this, particularly by
identifying qualified international experts available under various retiree programs in Europe and North
America. In the short-term, however, existing providers of consulting services have the capabilities to
cater for the relatively uncomplicated immediate needs of the private sector. Moreover, private
consulting firms, through their own experience as private entrepreneurs and understanding of the local
market, customs and language are seen as well placed to cater for the expected increase of demand for
consulting assistance. The balanced growth of the consulting industry will be enhanced by the existence
of a range of sources of technical assistance, including NGO's and donor projects which often make
available expatriate expertise and ensure that private entrepreneurs can chose between alternative sources
of assistance.

RWADESE REPUBLIC
Private Sector Support Fund
I. Objective and Rationale
1.           Firms in Rwanda face two types of constraints: external factors which affect the business
environment; and internal management inefficiencies. The Private Sector Support Fund (PSSF) is
designed to address the second issue. The primary objective of the approach is to strengthen the
managerial, technical and operating expertise within private businesses in Rwanda. A secondary objective
is to encourage the development of a growing and competitive market for professional, private consulting
services.
2.           The private sector in Rwanda is most recently established (three-quarters of the firms are
less than 20 years old), and has been sheltered from internal and external competition for most of its
existence. In the new liberal framework, the most binding long-term constraint to its continued
development lies in the lack of sufficient production and management know-how. Individual companies
have insufficient management expertise and have had little exposure to international management
practices. Surveys and available information indicate that such shortcomings can be found in companies
of all sizes: manufacture reject rates as high as 20 percent are not uncommon, accounting systems
generally are inadequate and only a few companies have any form of cost accounting. As a result the
private sector is inefficient and uncompetitive.
3.           Most Rwandese entrepreneurs are not yet accustomed to identifying investment
opportunities. New commercial and service companies usually are copies of existing operations and
manufacturing is limited to a small range of import substituting products. In this environment, the
relatively sophisticated concept of procuring expert advice from outside the company has gained little
acceptance, other than for feasibility studies. Nonetheless, such advice is badly needed if the sector is
to prosper in a newly liberalized economy.
4.           Between 10-15 private firms and three donor sponsored projects specialize in providing
business related expertise (see Annex 4). In addition, 14 NGO's provide some degree of technical
assistance or training for the private sector. The private firms offer a small range of services mostly
related to basic auditing of accounts (there are no chartered accountants in Rwanda) and mostly to donor
organizations, NGO's and state agencies. While private sector clients represent only 2-5 percent of the
worldoad of these consulting bureaus, these services are expected to grow as private companies, learn
what this type of outside assistance can do for them and how they can exploit it. The private sector is
also discouraged from turning to expert advice due to cost considerations and uncertainty on potential
benefits.
5.           Several donor projects have attempted to address these problems by providing higher
quality advisory services free of charge or at heavily subsidized rates, but so far with only partial success.
Most of these projects provide a predetermined range of services with emphasis on accounting, feasibility
analysis and some technical troubleshooting. Often the initial contact is established by project personnel.



- 63 -                                       Annex 5
Page 2 of 8
6.           Entrepreneurs typically have difficulty specifying the problems in their businesses and
identifying the areas that need improvement and in practice project experts often end up formulating the
need. In the absence of a clearly expressed demand the experts tend to recognize a problem that falls
within the limited range of services that their project offers. In the process the assistance becomes a
supply driven facility. Moreover, as the service usually comes at little or no cost to the recipient, the
entrepreneur has insufficient commitment to the process and little vested interest in its outcome.
7.           The problem with the prevailing approach to supplying advisory services is that it fails
to recognize that the advice needs to be broad to cover varying needs, and be 'owned' by the
entrepreneur to be truly effective. This means that the entrepreneur has to: (a) take the initiative in
procuring the service; (b) match identified needs with appropriate expertise, and (c) be committed to the
process and have a vested interest in its outcome. An integrated approach is therefore required that
stimulates the entrepreneurs to take this initiative and at the same time challenges the providers of
expertise to upgrade and expand their services.
II. project Design
8.           The proposed project component, which is inspired by successful similar programs in
other countries, would include the following three elements:
(i)    a program of entrepreneurship development seminars;
(ii)    a fund for financing the provision of consulting services to private sector companies on
a cost-sharing basis; and
(iii)   an intensive program of monitoring and evaluation.
Entrpreneurship Develpment Progam
9.           The purpose of this program is to change the way entrepreneurs approach their businesses
by reinforcing their analytical skills and making them recognize that the success of their business depends
as much on their own initiative as on outside circumstances. The approach to be used will be based on
the motivational training methodology that has been developed over the past two decades by several
companies and institutions around the world and which has achieved considerable success in encouraging
the entrepreneurs to ameliorate their operational and managerial know-how (see paras. 31-39) for course
outline).
10.          The training methodology is designed to foster and strengthen entrepreneurial motivation
and certain types of entrepreneurial skills such as risk taking, persistence, self confidence, quest for
quality, goal setting and planning. In the course of a two-week workshop participants are taken through
a mix of practical exercises, case studies, simulations and role plays. The central focus of the training
is a business creation exercise in which each participant is required alone or in partnership with others
to start a real business during the workshop. Approximately one third of the available time is devoted
to a business planning exercise during which the entrepreneurs are encouraged to analyze their own
strengths and weaknesses and those of the company and formulate a plan of action. At the end of the
two-week period the participants are expected to have a heightened sense of the shortcomings in their
business and in their expertise, and thus seek solutions.

Annex 5
Page 3 of 8
11.          The project will finance a series of these entrepreneurship development seminars each to
be attended by approximately 25 participants. Each seminar will be preceded by an advertizing and
promotion campaign and a selection process of participants. The training technology will be transferred
through a process of training of local trainers and translation of all materials into the national language.
Consulting FnEd
12.          A fund will be established that will screen proposals for consulting assignments submitted
by entrepreneurs and the consultants or consulting firms that they have selected and will apply a simple
formula for cost-sharing to these proposals. To help the entreprenurs in their selection the fund will
establish and maintain an expanding database on national and foreign individual consultants and consulting
firms. In identifying the foreign experts, a particular effort will be made to find qualified individuals
available at low cost through various retiree programs (see section V for a description of the policies and
operating procedures governing the fund).
13.          By subsidizing the service and not the provider, the fund enables consultants and
consulting firms to charge commercial rates, even to small private sector clients, and gives them an
incentive to strengthen their own expertise and enlarge their network of contacts with experts within and
outside of Rwanda. Growing demand is expected to attract the entry of foreign firms and Rwandan
professionals currently working in the Government or abroad field. As a result, the market for consulting
will expand, become more competitive and the quality of the services will increase. As demonstration
effect takes place the fund will also contribute to the creation of a self-sustaining market for business
consulting services.
14.          Experience with such consulting funds elsewhere (reviewed in Annex 13) has shown that
as a result of the transfer of expertise the recipient firms increase their revenues by a multiple of the
original costs of the consulting assignments. This experience is expected to be repeated in Rwanda.
Thus, the Government will more than fully recoup its investment through increased tax revenues.
Additionally, the proportions of the costs to be borne by the fund will decrease with use to ensure that
as many private firms as possible benefit.
Monitoring and Evaluation
15.          A key innovation of this approach is to integrate motivational training of entrepreneurs
and cost-sharing consulting funds. The combination of the two elements is designed to reinforce the
effectiveness of each and is expected to significantly enhance Rwandese business expertise. Due to of
its experimental nature, the effectiveness of the two elements will be monitored and if necessary some
of the arrangements following the first-year and the mid-term review will be altered or fine-tuned.
16.          The decision on the types of consulting expertise that are needed is left entirely to the
entrepreneur. A preliminary assessment by the appraisal team established a demand for expert advice
in such areas as project feasibility, equipment layout and manufactring efficiency, appropriate
technology, quality and production management, product strategy and marketing, purchasing and
inventory control, cost accounting and financial management, and personnel management. In some
instances the entrepreneur may not be able to find this expertise locally, particularly in the early stages
of the project. In such cases, an international expert will be needed and could be found either directly
or with the help of the project's data base or through a local consulting firm.



- 65 -                                    Annex 5
Page 4 of 8
17.         In this approach no particular category of enterprises will be targeted, except for PEs and
large firms with more than 250 permanent workers, and subsidiaries of multi-national corporations, who
will not be eligible. Eligibility of entrepreneurs will be on the basis of showing the initiative to formulate
a need, locating an expert, and willingness to pay part of the cost. The entrepreneurship development
seminars are designed to foster this type of attitude and therefore it can be expected that most of the
demand will come from past participants, particularly in the early stage of the program. Participants to
the seminars will be selected based on their entrepreneurial inclinations rather than the type of business.
It can be envisioned that the initial seminar will be targeted to the decision makers of larger enterprises,
thereby lending a certain prestige and credibility to the program.
HI. Project Management and Implementation
18.          The project component would be managed by a small unit of not more than two
professionals, in charge of organizing the seminar program, and the consulting fund. It is foreseen that
an international expert will be recruited to head the unit for at least the first two years and the other
professional would be recruited from the local private sector. Management of the consulting fund would
be kept as simple as possible by keeping the eligibility and approval criteria for consulting proposals to
a minimum and hiring an outside firm to conduct regular audits of the accounts and disbursements.
19.          The unit will be independent, but overseen by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
The PSSF would be responsible for the advertising campaign, through the media and private sector
organizations, overseeing the execution of the seminar program, managing the consulting fund and
monitoring its results. An outside company would be contracted to prepare and conduct the first series
of seminars, translate the materials into Kinyarwanda and transfer the selection and training methodology
to a group of local trainers. Once fully qualified, these local trainers would be contracted by the unit to
prepare and conduct the subsequent seminars.
20.          No new institution will be created to house the program. A number existing institutions
were considered to house the program. Government agencies were ruled out because too a close an
identification with the Government has been the main cause of failure of many past private sector support
programs. Similarly, the Chamber of Commerce was excluded because it is being restructured. While,
commercial banks, the national development bank and a number of NGO's were also considered, the
Banque de Kigali was selected as the most suitable candidate because it is a dynamic well run commercial
bank with a good image among the private sector of Rwanda. Under the proposed arrangement this bank
would provide the management unit with office space and would manage its accounts. This bank would
also serve as the official 'sponsor' of the entrepreneurship development program, which will be held in
facilities provided by IWACU, and NGO. Identified co-sponsors will include DUTEREMBE (a NGO
helping women) and IWACU.
21.          The project component will expose the Rwandan entrepreneurs to a wide range of national
and international expertise and put them in a better position to face the competitive challenges that will
come with economic liberalization. In the immediate future this will help them save and restructure their
current businesses. In the long term it will induce them to capitalize on the new investment opportunities
as they present themselves. The project would also promote the growth of a local class of management
experts by facilitating the transfer of management expertise from abroad. The principal risk is that the
present political and security situation fails to stabilize and that business confidence and investment fails
to pick-up.

IV. PSSF Draft Statement of Policies and Operating Procedur
Eligibility Criteria
22.          Firm Eligibility The fund is intended for formal and informal private sector operators
including manufacturers, retailers, traders, service providers and agro-processors. These businesses may
be located in Kigali or elsewhere in the country and the fund does not make any distinction based on the
size of the business or the nationality of its owners. Purely agricultural enterprises will not be eligible
because their technical assistance needs are already provided for in other projects.
EXDendtiture Eligibility
23.          The fund is not intended to finance equipment purchases even if such a purchase forms
part of the consultant's recommendations. Likewise regular payroll and operating expenses of the client
are not covered. The fund would contribute to the expenses of technical and advisory services in such
areas as:
- productivity improvement and cost reduction;
- product quality and consistency;
- product design and packaging improvements;
- appropriate equipment selection;
- market research;
- accounting, product pricing and financial management;
- enterprise restructuring;
- personnel management and incentive systems;
- feasibility studies.
Funding and Cost Sharing Arrangements
24.          During the four year commitment period of the project, a total sum of US$4.0 million
will be made available to the fund. This amount will be allocated as follows:
Training/Administration and management   US$1.0 million
Consulting services                      US$1.50 million
Totat                                   IUSS2.5 million
25.          Experience with these types of technical assistance programs elsewhere has shown that
recipients are much more interested in and committed to the successful outcome of the assistance if they
are being required to participate in its costs. The fund will use a cost sharing formula that combines
administrative simplicity with the necessary flexibility to decide whether a local or foreign consultant will
be used and for how long. The total cost of the consulting is used as the base for establishing a cost
sharing arrangement. The fund will contribute up to a maximum of US$43,000 per single eligible firm.
Each client is expected to share in the costs according to the following formula:

U, to USSIO0000 of Consulting:    the client will pay 30 percent of the consulting cost;

of the assignment;
From USS50.001 to USS100.000:    70 percent of the total cost is paid for by the client.
26.          Most experience with consulting funds has been gained where qualified consultants are
readily available locally. The range of consulting expertise on hand in Rwanda is more limited and
therefore it can be expected that, at least in an early stage of the program, some of the expertise needs
to come from abroad. The cost sharing formula has been designed not to penalize clients who want to
procure expatriate expertise.
V.
Aoroval of Consultants
27.          The fund will maintain a register of consultants and consulting firms that can be consulted
by the private sector. Individuals and firms providing the service will have to demonstrate they possess
the expertise required. Consultants who fail to perform more than once will be excluded.
Pocessine of Proooals
28.          Although it will be the responsibility of the client to submit a proposal for a consulting
assignment to the fund, the Fund Manager will ensure that the client formulates clear and precise terms
of reference. Experience with similar consulting funds elsewhere has shown that clients may have
difficulty formulating sufficiently specified terms of reference and hence run the risk of not getting a
satisfactory performance from their consultants. This risk is particularly acute in such difficult to
circumscribe areas as marketing or personnel management. The Fund Manager will also decide with the
client on the duration of the assignment. All of these details will be included in a contract drawn up
between the fund, the client and the consultant or consulting firm. Concept contract forms, examples of
terms of reference and other forms will be Included in an operational maumal that will be developed in
the first implementation phase of the project.
Monitoring
29.          Upon completion of the assignment the consultant needs to submit with the Fund Manager
a brief completion report which follows a standard outline and has been approved by the client. Once
this report has been received the fund will release its payment to the consultant. The Fund Manager pays
a follow-up visit to the client one month after the end of the assignment to obtain feedback and every six
months thereafter to monitor the implementation of the recommendations and any resulting improvement
in the company's performance.

30.          Th  manaer will prepare annual budgets. Every quarter the manager should prepare
reports on the activities of the fund during the previous quarter, will provide an update on the
performance of the clients, and submit an action plan for the following period which needs to specify such
activities as seminars, publicity, extension efforts and upcoming consulting assigmnents.
VI.  tRhnirshig Development Outline of a 3)Mical Course
31.          Entrepreneurs around the world share certain types of characteristics which distinguish
them from other individuals. Among these are such competencies as self confidence, persistence, goal
utting, planning, risk taking, opportunity seeking, information seeking, a quest for quality and efficiency,
pesuaion and a commitment to their work. An effective entrepreneurship development course is
desWned to foter ad strengthen these competencies and in the process reinforce the entrepreneurial
motivation of the participants. The typical training methodology forces the participants to reflect on their
strengths and weaknesses in each of these competencies and encourages them to reinforce their
eteprenourial behavior. It should be emphasized that this type of course does not intend to impart new
technical skills, but rather to bring about a modification in the behavior of the participants. The
methodology has proven to be singularly successfui in this respect.
32.          A typical course lasts about two weeks and includes a mix of practical exercises, case
studies, simulations and role plays. The following are some of the most important features of the course
s it has been trained elsewhere in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin-America:
*'i)   rla _  i". Each participant alone or in partnership with others is required
to start an actual busines during the workshop. These micro-busineses in turn become
the focus of many of the other exercises in the workshop. Thus, the participants are
asked to conduct a market research on their micro-business using questionnaires that they
themselves need to develop and among potential clients that they themselves need to
identify. Small amounts of credit are made available to those participants that submit a
written loan application and provide a physical guarantee. Ihis exercise contains a
competitive element as the most profitable business is awarded a prize.
(il)                         . A specially developed format allows the participants to work
trough all the important steps of buinesu planning and develop a complete buinoeu plan
for their msting business or a new venture. In the course of this exercise a whole range
of concepts and terms are clarified which until then may have been the source of
considerable confusion among the participants.
(iii)   Case Studies. A number of cases are developed which incorporate local conditions and
are used for various financial exercises, market research, and role plays on persuasion
strategies and negotiation tactics.
(iv)   GustSgukg. A well known entrepreneur from the community is invited to come and
share his or her experiences with the class. Participants are encouraged to recognize the
entrepreneurial characteristics in the speaker's behavior.

Page 8 of 8
(v)    Ouality and Efficiency Exercise. Using locally made products, participants are asked to
identify ways that these products could be made better, faster and cheaper. Ihey ar
encouraged to develop production diagrams and quality control systems and are required
to develop a plan on how to apply the leuons learned in their own busines.
(vi) Banker Presentation. Local banms are invited to send representatives who form one or
more committees to which each participant is required to make a presentation about his
or her business. The participants have previously been coached and given the
opportunity to rehearse their presentation on video. The objective of this exercise is not
necessarily for the participant to apply for a bank loan, but to gain experience in malkin
a public presentation.
33.           Throughout the course the emphasis is on participation and team work and at the uad of
the two to three-week period the participants usually form an association to retain some of thoe pirit of
camaraderie that has developed. Experience elsewhere has shown that these asociations can become
important networking tools and venues for follow-up technical assistance.

PRIVATE SECTO DEVELOPMENr PROJECT
Business Law Reform in Rwanda
I. md
1.           The present Rwandese legal system is not conducive to creating the kind of climrat
necessary for the development of private sector commercial activity. The shortcomings of the system stem
from two sources. First, the legal system itself i antiquated and constraining. Most of the basic
legislative texts in force in Rwanda today date back to the colonial period. The recent reforms in a
limited number of areas have only begun to address this problem. The formation and registration of
business enterprises continues to be onerous; the Government continues to ask too many questions
invasive of business privacy; the managers of companies are restricted in their authority to act in
conformity with their reasonable business judgment. The institutions which are called upon to enforce
and interpret these laws and enforce commercial contracts are inadequate, obsolete, ineffective,
understaffed, and act very slowly. The courts of genend jurisdiction are seized with a proliferation of
commercial cases with an average docket-life of seven years. Debtors hide behind delays and because
there are no adequate conservation measures, creditors are often left unsatisfied. Therefore, creditors
are reluctant to extend credit and guaranties are not readily available. Since there is very little credit or
installment purchases at the retail level, people often spend a long time to save enough for the full
purchase price of durable goods. Reselling (particularly into a used or second-hand market) is hampered
by arcane rules governing ownership and the enforcement of the creditor's interests in the collateral.
2.           At present, the development of private sector commercial activity is marred by (a) a fear
of risk-taking at both the owner's and management levels, reinforced by a justified fear of moral and
personal fmancial consequences of failure; and (b) a complex and intrusive set of requirements for the
formation and registration of business entities. Once the corporal aspects of entrepreneurship are
completed, the enterprise begins operations in a legal environment given to arcane principles and
practices, inefficient administration of justice, and a gener anti-business bias.
II. Measures Taken
3.            Recognizing the need for business law reform, the Government has taken the first steps
toward liberalizing the requirements for registration and licensing of businesses. In 1991 a new law
moved the Registry of Commerce from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to the office of the clerk
of the court of the first instance. The same law abolished the requirement that the creation of business
entities be approved by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. This measure loosened the Ministry's
grip on the formative stages of enterprise creation, and reduced the delays experienced in the creation
and registration process (often over one year's delay). In response to the needs of investors and the
Rwandan business community, the Government has also agreed to prepare an action plan for commercial
law reform.

Page 2 of 10
m. Actions To Be Taken
4.            The appraisal mission has identified six major areas of reform. As described below, they
regard (a) creation and functioning of enterprises, (b) registration of businesses, (c) laws affecting
commerce or business, (d) bankruptcy law and procedure, (e) creation of a commercial tribunal, and (f)
privatization of auxiliaries of justice. The detailed description of the actions to be taken is contained in
the attached Draft Business Law Reform Matrix (Annex 6-B).
Creation and Punctiong of Enerises
S.            At present, the law places onerous requirements on the formation of companies, such
as a minimum requirement for capital and number of shareholders; limits business managers' freedom
of action, such as requiring the manager to post personal bonds for performance; and requires disclosure
of information that is by most standards intrusive, such as on personal assets, matrimonial assets, past
proceedings with creditors, and alike. Together, these requirements stifle commercial activity. This calls
for a wholesale reform of the law governing the formation and operation of commercial enterprises.
6.            From the point of view of risk management and limitations on personal liability, the
preferred form of business is limited liability company (societe anonyme) and a lesser version of it called
limited liability partnership (societe I responsabilite limitee). However, under the present law, the form
of a S.A. busineu reserved for people who can trust and associate with six others and raise a minimum
of Fr 100,000,000 ($687,000) in the case of privately-held S.A. and a minimum of Fr 200,000,000
($1,334,000) in the case of a publicly-held S.A. Equally, onerous is the requirement that an S.A.R.L.
have a minimum capital of Fr 500,000 ($3,300). Thus, wealth is a precondition to doing business. Once
a business is formed, the managers cannot exercise their judgment in the best interest of the company,
because they are required by law to post personal guaranties Oike real estate or other valuables) as
security. Further, by law, the manager is an instrumentally of the directors rather than the steward of
the corporation's interests. The founders of businesses are also required to disclose personal information
that is in most part inconsequential to the business-worthiness of an enterprise.
7.            Therefore, the law governing the formation of business entities should be amended to
extend the benefits of limited liability to as many formations as possible, including sole proprietorships.
The law will be reformed so entrepreneurs may choose between a few basic business forms, leaving their
permutation to the shareholders to contract whatever additional terms and conditions they wish to
undertake as among themselves. Moreover, the law will allow the directors and managers the freedom
to exercise their best reasonable business judgment without the fear of being personally liable for their
corporate decision-making. Instead, the reform will provide for the company to buy director, officer,
or manager liability insurance coverage eventually to insure against risks arising out of corporate
management. Finally, the law will provide for greater privacy in the area of disclosure of personal and
confidential business information.
Registration of Businesses and Licensing
8.           Reforming the registration requirements has three objectives. First, it is itended to
encourage businesse to register, particularly those active in the informal sector, and improve their access
to credit. Second, to transform the registration process from an impediment to business fbrmation to a
promoter of limited liability (no limited liability unless registered) and flexibility in the conduct of one's
affairs. Third, to shift the policing of enterprises from the public sector (as evidenced by the requirement



- 72 -                                  Annex 6-A
Page 3 of 10
to disclose detailed information to the Registry of Commerce) to the private sector (through the
mechanism of caveat emptor and due diligence). These would lead to changes in the Government's role
from regulator to facilitator.
9.           Consistent with the goal of reducing amount and nature of information disclosed by
businesses, the present law on the Registry of Commerce must be amended to provide greater privacy
and confidentiality. The present acquisition of detailed information and its retention on a public document
(registry) raises the fear that the information might be misused. This fear, in turn, discourages
compliance with registration requirements and promotes false disclosures of information on the part of
founders and companies.
10.          Another source of discontent with the registration scheme is the requirement that a
business enterprise is licensed to be active only in the specific area of business which it state in its
incorporation papers and on the Registry of Commerce. Therefore, registration takes away the freedom
of an entrepreneur to seize upon other opportunities as they arise. The desire to be flexible therefore
argues against registering one's business, except as a purely non-binding statistical requirement.
Commercial Laws
11.          The gradual diminution of the Government's role in the commercial life of the country
means that relationships between businesses themselves, businesse and the public, and the various parties
to a wide variety of transactions must be based on a set of predictable, consistent and stable rules of
commerce. While the freedom to contract will take the place of ordering of relations by legislation or
executive decrees, the law should also provide some substantive and procedural rules to protect rights and
enforce obligations.
12.          The present body of commnercial laws Ooosely defined as the "commercial code') is a
compilation of texts, some amended and some not, dating back to the colonial era. The antiquity of these
laws aside, they do not reflect modem concepts including those currently practiced in Belgium or France.
Nevertheless, the Rwandese commercial practice has adopted and does apply certain modern business
concepts for which the law has been lagging. Examples of such practices include the current practice in
the areas of guaranties and installment credit purchases. However, where the practice and law converge,
confusion reigns.
13.          In the daily jargon the term used often to indicate a guaranty is aval". Unless the parties
indicate with precision what they mean by the term, the law will determine that the guaranty is 'joint and
several' with the guarantied party having the right to go up against the guarantor for the entire obligation
without the need first to seek relief from the beneficiary of the guaranty. Naturally, the ambiguity has
led to practices where people give 'avals" meaning to give 'cautionnements" (same as 'aval' but with
the duty of first recourse against the debtor) and, conversely, people obtain a "cautionnement" and then
insist on having obtained an "aval" so as to gain rapid satisfaction of their claims.
14.          Purchases on credit are very rare. This instrument would accelerate the rise In the
standard of living by removing the capital formation requirement for the full purchase price and allowing
the buyer to gain possession of durable goods earlier in life. Purchase on credit is also conducive to
greater commercial (buy/sell) activity. Under the current law, however, a credit purchase is viewed as
a tool to manage poverty of means or indebtedness and not as a financing mechanism. Second-hand or
used markets for durable goods are also rare. The culprit is an arcane business notion that "one cannot



-73 -                                   Annex 6-A
Page 4 of 10
sell that which is not his". Under this theory, one must first obtain title (as in document) to the goods
purchased on credit before one can convey the goods to a third person. By the same token, the third
party will not advance the purchase money required for the obtainment of the title without the reseller
showing proof of ownership (i.e., the title document). Consequently, an entire area of modem commerce
based on possession and transfers of possession is lost to the Rwandan business sector. To take the
analysis one step further, this prohibition on transfer of possession has led to a situation where the
creditors take, more often than not, a security interest in the physical goods, as opposed to a seller's lien
on the balance of the purchase price as a liquidated debt of the purchaser. Therefore, as soon as one
resells the goods to a third party, the creditor moves against the third party regardless of whether the
third party is a bone fide purchaser. The up-shot is that the economy is stagnant, inventories over-
stocked, commerce anemic, and the standard of living wanting.
15.           Therefore, the Government needs to (a) modernize and clarify the confusions present in
the existing laws touching on the substantive areas of commercial transactions, such as in the areas of
guaranties, secured transactions, and negotiable instruments; (b) codify new business law concepts already
in use, such as installment credit purchases, and to promote the use of new business practices based on
legal concepts not as yet a developed part of Rwanda's business culture, such as factoring, leasing and
lease-financing. These objectives are designed to promote predictability and stability in the business
environment, help develop financed or credit-based activities, develop a legitimate market in second-hand
or used goods, and encourage the evolution of the business legal environment to a permissive one (that
is, what is not expressly prohibited is therefore permitted).
Bankruptcy Law & Procedure
16.           The anticipated surge in business activity, including in credit-based or financed
transactions, will necessitate a revision of the laws governing creditors' rights and assure prompt and fair
disposition of bankruptcy matters. The present system is based on Belgian laws half a century old. In
the majority of cases, businesses close and go out of business without properly addressing the interests
of the creditors. In a judicial system marred with inefficiencies, the historic anti-business or anti-creditor
sentiment makes it difficult for the creditors (usually, the banks) to receive satisfaction. Conservatory
measures are not effective against a debtor bent on squandering one's assets. Judgments are delayed
through procedural manoeuvres which permit the assets of the debtor to be wasted or hidden. Executions
are late in coming, and often only a small part of the claim is recoverable.
17.           From the point of view of judicial administration and business law, the present bankruptcy
laws and procedures are inadequate. Resources are limited and under strain. The auxiliaries of justice
specialized in bankruptcy and liquidation matters are virtually non-existent. The bias of the system favors
the debtor to the unfair detriment of the creditor. Creditors are therefore reluctant to lend, and when they
do lend they require security beyond the means of most entrepreneurs and, much less, the start-ups.
18.           Therefore, the authorities should (a) unify and modernize the bankruptcy laws and
procedures to befit a modem business law system; (b) provide for stronger protection of creditor's rights;
and (c) reduce the time in which bankruptcies are settled. In providing for these objectives, the reform
will aim at two broader goals as well. First, the paralyzing fear of bankruptcy must disappear;
bankruptcies, including compositions and concordats, must be viewed as business risk management tools.
Second, the penalties attendant upon going bankrupt must be civil damages; criminality must attach only
to bankruptcies which are the result of or leading to fraud.

Tribunal of Commerce and Procedure
19.           The present judicial system does not meet the commercial litigation needs of the business
community. It cannot be expected to accommodate the predictable rise in commercial litigation caused
by future increases in commercial activity. The inadequacies of the present judicial system are many.
The most important shortcoming is excessive delays in the processing of cases. The average life from
complaint to execution of judgment is seven years. The delay is caused by lack of qualified personnel,
resources that are under severe strain, and by procedural manoeuvres used by litigants to delay the
process. The strain is caused by under-staffing as well as the limited number of judges versed in
commercial law matters. As of November, 1992, some 500 commercial cases are docketed for action
and just three judges of sufficient skill to preside over them. The delay postpones trial, which diminishes
the incentive to ward off the prospects of an adverse decision by setting the matter out of court. No
serious attempt hu been made to create a private sector arbitration panel. Specialization is lacking, and
often the judges themselves are manipulated by skillful attorneys. Meanwhile, contracts are left
unenforced and the rights of creditors are violated. Measures of self-help such as personal settling of
accounts seem to be on the rise. These measures could weaken the social order and confidence in the
judicial system.
20.           Therefore, a self-standing commercial tribunal with adequate expertise is urgently
required. The proposed reforms call for the establishment of an independent tribunal to deal exclusively
with disputes arising under the business laws of Rwanda. This tribunal can (a) expedite the resolution
of commercial disputes by a judicial personnel trained in matters of commercial law and practice; and
(b) expand the judicial resources of the country to cope with the increase in litigation arising from the
expansion in private economic and commercial activities. The ultimate aim is to effect an orderly,
prompt, and just enforcement of contractual obligations, and promote commercial activity.
Privatization of the Auxiliaries of Justice
21.           The prohibition of private notaries public and other legal auxiliary activities (e.g.,
process-servers, auditors, evaluators, receivership judges, auctioneers) constitutes a constraint on the
efficient functioning of the judicial system.
22.           Consistent with the development of a modenized business law environment and the
establishment of an effective commercial tribunal, certain inefficient aspects in the delivery of legal and
paralegal services by the auxiliaries of justice also need to be streamlined. Presenty, the auxiliaries are
government employees and their number is determined by the Ministry of Justice. There is no evidence,
however, whether augmenting the numbers of the auxiliaries will increase the efficiency with which the
services are delivered.
23.           The proposed reform aims to shift to the private sector most of the functions presently
performed by the auxiliaries of justice. This action will (a) bring to the administration of justice
efficiencies (in cost, time, and speed) induced by the profit motive, (b) decentralize and therefore reduce
the potential for conflict of interests innate in a vertically-organized administrative system, (c) provide
the litigants with an alternative source for services performed by the auxiliaries of justice, and (d) provide
an independent source of auxiliary services for the aforementioned Tribunal of Commerce and the
litigants before it. It is hoped that this will eventually provide the necesary impetus to a system-wide
privatization of the auxiliaries of justice.

IV. Tribunal of Commerce
24.           Purpose and Jurisdiction The Tribunal of Commerce proposed by the plan of action
("Tribunal") shall have plenary and exclusive original subject matter jurisdiction over all disputes arising
under the business laws of Rwanda, without regard to the status of the parties be it merchant, civilian,
governmental, or consumer.
25.           Organic Law creating the Tribunal The Tribunal shall be created by the branch of
government in which the Constitution vests the power to establish courts. The instrument which
establishes the Tribunal ("Act") shall inter alia:
(a)    provide for the transfer to the Tribunal the commercial jurisdiction presently
exercised by the civil courts;
(b)    charge the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to establish a Committee of
Experts to author a plan of implementation with respect to the creation of the
Tribunal, its rules of procedure and evidence (the same as the Civil courts), and
it composition;
(c)    move the Registry of Commerce to the Office of the Clerk of the Tribunal;
(d)    provide for the following references of authority: (i) that the existing caseload of
the commercial chamber of the court of the first instance (Kigali) be transferred
to the Tribunal; (ii) that the commercial cases pending before the other courts of
the first instance accept complaints and pleadings in commercial matters and refer
them to the Tribunal for judicial consideration;
(e)    provide for the establishment and functioning of the Tribunal within one year
from the day of enactment of the Act; and
(f)    provide for the privatization of the functions of the auxiliaries of justice along the
professional lines of "syndics", process servers, notaries public, appraisers, and
liquidators.
26.           There shall be no requirement that the cases brought before the Tribunal have a minimum
amount in controversy.
27.           The statute of limitations governing disputes referred to the Tribunal shall be one year
from the date on which the plaintiff became aware of being injured or damaged.
28.           The duration of a case, from commencement of an action to judgment, shall take no
longer than one year from the date of the commencement.
29.           The Seat of the Tribunal and Access to Justice The seat of the Tribunal shall be located
in Kigali. Until such time that each prefecture may have its own functioning branch or division of the
Tribunal, the Tribunal shall be the central organ for the docketing and trial of commercial cases. There
will be instances in which the disputants will not have the means to acces the Tribunal in Kigali. In such
instances, the cases filed in the court of the first instance for the prefecture will be transferred to Kigali



- 76 -                                     Annex 6-A
Page 7 of 10
for docketing; the trial and other matters requiring the presence of a judicial officer shall take place at
the prefecture by a traveling judge, magistrate, or other auxiliary ofjustice. For such purposes all judges
and auxiliaries shall travel to the prefectures on a rotational basis.
30.           Comoition The composition of the Tribunal will be as follows. There shal be six
judges, each qualified for the job from the rank of presently active or recently retired judges versed in
commercial law and of impeccable reputation for fairness. Nominated by the President and endorsed by
the Legislature, their tenure shall be for life and their salaries shall be established by the national
legislature. They shall be subject to rigorous scrutiny as to conflicts of interests and appearance of
impropriety. They shall recuse themselves in the case of presiding upon a case involving their interest
or relatives.
31.           Divisions  The Tribunal shall consist of three divisions: (a) trial division, (b)
administrative division, and (c) auxiliary services division.
(a)    The Trial Division shall consist of one or several chambers, each consisting of
the following:
(i)    A presiding judge;
(ii)    At least two reputable professional businessmen chosen from a roster
maintained by the President of the Tribunal.
Ciii)   A full-time calendar clerk, who shall assist the judge in managing the
judge's caseload and administrative affairs ('Calendar Clerk'). No
formal legal training is necesary for this position;
(iv)   A full-time judicial clerk, who shall assist the judge in researching and
writing decisions and opinions ("Judicial Clerk"). Some legal training
will be required for this position. Ideally, recent graduates or students
of senior standing at the Faculty of Law at the UNR may be suitable for
this position;
(v)    A part-time maitre-expert, who shall assist the judge and the judicial
clerk in the ascertainment of the facts of the case, custom and practice
of the relevant trade, and the issues of law. No formal legal training is
necessary for this position. A maitre-expert should be versed in business
law matters and have had experience in the private sector; and
(vi)   A full-time maitre-judiciaire, to whom the judge may delegate certain
judicial functions such as deciding matters which involve very
insignificant amounts or touch upon legal issues which have been the
subject of jurisprudence constante;
The constellation of the judge's helpers - calendar and judicial clerks,
maitre expert, and maitre judiciaire - will constitute each chamber's
staff.

(i)    Clerk of the Tribunal, who shall be in charge of the administrative
functions of the tribunal, including the maintenance of the premises, the
calendar, records, external affairs of the Tribunal, and relations between
the chambers and the division of auxiliary services. No legal training is
required for this position. The person presiding over this office shall
have proven managerial capabilities. The Clerk of the Tribunal shall be
assisted by such additional personnel as recommended by the President
of the Tribunal and endorsed by the Ministry of Justice or Commerce.
(ii)    Registrar of Commerce, who shall have in his custody the Registry of
Commerce.   He shall be assisted in Its duties by such additional
personnel as recommended by the President of the Tribunal and endorsed
by the Ministry of Justice or Commerce.
(c)    The Auxiliary services division shall consist of the following:
(i)    A Director who shall supervise the following private Auxiliaries of
Justice:
a.     Six syndics (bankruptcy estate trustees)
b.    Twelve process servers
c.     Six conservators (Judicial bankruptcy trustees or conservators)
d.    Six appraisers
e.     Six liquidators (or auctioneers)
f.     Six bailiffs (for courtroom order)
The auxiliaries of justice shall be at the service and for the furtherance of the
business of the chambers. Except the bailiffs and the conservators, none of the
auxiliaries shall be employees of the government; they shall be independent
contractors under 2-year contracts with the Tribunal, with each contract being
renewable for 2 additional successive 2-year terms. They shall draw a base
compensation adjusted upward on the basis of performance.
(ii)   The Manager shall be assisted by such additional personnel recommended
by the President of the Tribunal and endorsed by the Ministry of Justice
or Commerce.
Where it does not result in absurdity, the auxiliary of justice may be a legal or
natural person.
32.           President of the Tribunal The President of the Tribunal shall be nominated by the
majority of the votes of the judges of the Tribunal. He shall serve for four-year terms not to exceed
twelve years in total.
33.           ApDels Appeals from the decisions of the Tribunal shall be referred to the Chambre
d'Appel of the Tribunal within fifteen days after the date of the decision of the trial division. The



- 78 -                                    Annex 6-A
Page 9 of 10
Chambre d'Appel consists at any given time of three disinterested Tribunal judges, who shall be elected
from the pool of the disinterested Tribunal judges by a draw conducted by the Clerk of the Tribunal.
The Clerk of the Tribunal shall manage the business of the Chambre d'Appel.
34.          Apellate Decisions The decision of the Chambre d'Appel shall be rendered in less than
10 days. The Chambre d'Appel shall not reverse a decision of the Tribunal unless a decision of the
Tribunal is based on defective jurisdiction, error of law, fraud, or egregious error of fact.
35.          A decision of the Chambre d'Appel shall be appealed to Cour d'Appel only on the
grounds of defective jurisdiction, error of law, fraud, egregious error of fact. No decision of the
Chambre d'Appel may be reviewed for constitutionality by any appellate court unless the issue is first
certified by the Cour d'Appel shall be deemed as executed as against the losing party and kept in trust
by the Tribunal until final disposition of appeal(s). Such an entrustment may be avoided if the losing
party posts a bond in the amount of the verdict. This blend of appellate review will assure due process
as well as guard against the abuse of the appeals process.
36.          Articulation of decisions The decision of the Tribunal at either trial or appeals levels shall
be rendered in writing . Each decision shall set forth the following:
(a)    The names of the parties, date of filing of the complaint, docket number, date of
hearings or other oral presentations, date of decision, names of the persons
representing the parties, the name of the presiding judge, and the name of the
judge rendering the decision.
(b)    A brief description of the procedural history of the case.
(c)    A statement of the facts of the case as agreed upon by both parties. A statement
of the facts not agreed to by both parties, but which one party has admitted to his
own detriment. A statement of the facts as found by the judge, or any of the
maitre. Statements of fact must be based on documentary or testimonial
evidence.
(d)    A recitation of legal issue(s) raised by the parties. Issues not raised by the
parties in writing or in oral pleadings shall not be treated by the Tribunal; under
no circumstances shall such non-articulated issues determine the outcome of the
case even if the Tribunal deems such determination to be just or equitable.
(e)    The decision of the Tribunal, which must be based on the facts before it, the
issues as framed by the litigants, and the applicable law. No case shall be
decided on the basis of what the law should or ought to be. No case shall be
decided solely on the basis of public policy or social policy.
(f)    The reasoning supporting the decision.
V. Operational Considerations
37.          The results intended by the proposed reforms will be best achieved by a contemporaneous
implementation of the following:



- 79 -                                  Annex 6-A
Page 10 of 10
(a)    automating the procedures attendant upon the registration of business entities at
the Registry of Commerce;
(b)    automating the filing of complaints, docketing procedures, and the entry of
orders and decisions of the Tribunal of Commerce;
(c)    providing desk-top publication facilities to the entity responsible for the
publication of the Official Gazette for the purpose of codifying and binding
legislative and regulatory texts, the publication of judicial decisions of the
Tribunal of Commerce, and the periodical annotation thereof reflecting the recent
changes in the law, rules, and jurisprudence;
(d)   training the auxiliaries of justice in the functions of their offices;
(e)   instructing the six Tribunal of Commerce judges in the latest business law
techniques;
(*)    providing each of the six judges of the Tribunal of Commerce a clerk to assist
in the management of his caseload, and an expert from the private sector versed
in commercial practices;
(g)    encouraging the private sector to establish a center for the settlement of business
disputes and fund. The center shall provide arbitration services, mediation
services, and other non-judicial alternative methods of dispute resolution; and
(h)    assembling the laws relating to business into one body of work comprised of one
or more volumes.
Lmeabh
38.          The proposed business law reforms are expected to take about one year from January
1994 to be adopted. Continuous monitoring and follow-up will be necessary, however to ensure adequate
implementation and to identify other constraints on private sector development not apparent at the present.
Conclusion
39.          The changes proposed are consistent with Rwanda's business law tradition, and any
innovation or novel concept is proposed with the current and future Rwanda business law development
in mind. Some of the innovative concepts such as factoring and leasing are of Anglo-American tradition,
but have been adopted by the French and Belgian systems as well. Some others, such as corporate law
reform, are inspired by the Anglo-American system. Therefore, the proposed reforms will result in a
so-called hybrid' business law system, that exists in some countries such as Canada. A business law
reform based on simplicity of form and universality of language, however, will permit Rwanda's business
law and business community to interface more effectively with the rest of the world.

RWANDESE REPUBUC
PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Structure and Characteristics of the Flnancial Sector
A. Background
1.           The Bank carried out a detailed study of financial policies and institutions of Rwanda, the
main conclusions and recommendations of which are contained in a report entitled Rwanda - Financial
Sector Review (Report No. 8934-RW), distributed to the Executive Directors on May 16, 1991. The
sector review led to the preparation of a Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC) which was appraised
in May 1991, and negotiated in October 1991. The Credit will be submitted to the consideration of the
Executive Directors when the macroeconomic conditions permit.
2.           The Government has made progress in implementing some aspects of the reform program,
as described below. Minimum conditions for a line of credit are met given the developments on interest
rate policy; the reforms being introduced in prudential regulations affecting bank provisions for risks, and
financial audits; and the strengthening of the supervisory function of the Central Bank. Technical
assistance in support of financial sector reforms will be provided by the Swiss Government, under a
program which has been developed in cooperation with the Bank, and which will be administered by the
Bank.
B. Structure of the Financial Svstem
3.           The financial system of Rwanda has fared better than that of many other African
countries. However, the system is fragile and has been adversely affected by the economic downturn of
the past three years. The financial sector is comprised of the Central Bank, the Banque Nationale du
Rwanda (BNR), three commercial banks - Banque Commerciale du Rwanda (BCR), Banque de Kigali
(BK), and Banque Continentale Africaine du Rwanda (BACAR) - and two savings institutions, the Caisse
d'Epargne du Rwanda (CER) and the Union des Banques Populaires (UBP). A development bank,
Banque Rwandaise de Developpement (BRD), a housing finance institution, Caisse Hypothecaire du
Rwanda (CHR), and three insurance companies (SONARWA, SORAS, and INGOBOKA a newcomer
in 1991) complete the financial sector. Caisse Sociale du Rwanda (CSR, the social security and pension
fund), is an important holder of long-term government obligations.
4.           Government equity participation in the capital of financial institutions is important.
Except for one, relatively new commercial bank (BACAR), two insurance companies and the system of
savings and loans cooperatives ("banques populaires"), the operating budget of which is subsidized by
the Swiss Government aid agency, all other financial institutions have total or significant public
ownership. However, contrary to practices prevalent in other Sub-Saharan countries, the Government
generally has not interfered in the management and credit policies of the commercial banks where it has
a substantial equity participation. This is not the case for the government-owned housing institution
(CHR) and the savings institution (CER), where mismanagement by government appointees and political
interference have led to their virtual bankruptcies. Further to agreements reached with the Government
under FSAC, the Caisse d'Epargne du Rwanda is being liquidated. The Union des Banques Populaires,
developed with the assistance of the Swiss Government is well run, although not yet self-sustaining.

Donor representation in the development bank's Board has stymied government interference, although
government pressure did lead BRD to a period of lax credit policies during 1988-89 (Annex 8-B para.
15).
5.           Rwanda's financial system is rudimentary when compared with that of other countries at
a similar level of development, especially outside Sub-Saharan Africa. Indicators of the degree to which
financial products are available, or financial depth (M2/GDP of about 17 percent over the past four
years), put Rwanda well below the average for Africa as a whole (22.3 percent). Low income levels of
the largely rural population, and very high taxation rates of banking activities and profits, have
discouraged new entry in the sector and contributed to the shallow financial depth. As a result, the range
of financial services remains limited, and financial and capital markets undeveloped. Prior to 1987, the
banking system was segmented and specialized. Commercial banks were largely restricted by BNR
regulations to short-term credit activities, while medium-/long-term lending was virtually the monopoly
of BRD, the development bank, and CHR, the housing bank.
6.           The commercial banks are generally well-managed, and for two of them, BCR and BK,
capitalization levels are within internationally required levels, relative to their risk-weighted assets. For
the third bank, BACAR, not only is there a RwF9 million shortfall in the second-tier required risk
coverage level, but it has a low provision coverage of non-performing loans (Annex 8-C tables A8.3 and
A8.6). Due to of the size of the country, bank risks, including BRD's, are concentrated in a few large
borrowers, many of whom have been hit hard by increased exposure to external competitive pressures
stemming from economic policy reforms enacted under the Government's adjustment program, and by
the economic downturn resulting from the civil strife. As a result, there has been a deterioration of the
loan portfolio of the commercial banks and of the development bank, and therefore a substantial increase
in the required level of provisions for risk of losses. The traditionally solid financial situation of BRD,
the development bank, has deteriorated over the past three years as a result of the worsening economic
environment. In addition, BRD has been subject to political pressure, and was blamed for the low
investments in productive activities in the late eighties, particularly of the indigenous small- and medium-
enterprise sector. This pressure led BRD to substantially increase lending with adverse results on its
portfolio and financial situation (Annex 8-B).
C. Developments in Monetar, and Credit Polides
Ibe Central Ban
7.           Banque Nationale du Rwanda (BNR), the Central Bank, was created in 1964, and
reorganized into its current structure in 1981. It is headed by a Board of Directors presided by a
Governor who assumes day-to-day management and has wide ranging powers. Board members and the
Governor are proposed and appointed for three years by the Minister of Finance and the President of
Rwanda, respectively. The Minister of Finance is empowered to veto within three days any decision of
the Board. An Oversight Auditing Board assumes external control of BNR finances and operations. BNR
has a staff of 495 persons, including two Vice-governors, eight department directors, 42 division chiefs
and 46 professionals. The bank has a heavy structure and the departments operate with little coordination
among themselves. The quality of the staff is satisfactory and compares favorably with that of some
African Central Banks. The staff will, however, require substantial training to carry out its monetary and
supervisory functions. This training is contemplated under the FSAC.

Annex 8-A
Page 3 of 7
8.           Until 1990, BNR's monetary and credit policies relied heavily on direct instruments of
control. Interest rates and selective credit controls were used to direct credit to favored productive
activities (such as coffee) and thereby discouraged a much-needed diversification of the economy.
Priority sectors (primarily agriculture and manufacturing for import substitution) benefitted from
subsidized interest rates, while coffee exports were financed with a flat fee per kg, irrespective of the
duration and estimated cost of financing. In 1990, the effective interest rate for coffee exports was less
than three percent, while that for commercial activities was 12 percent. Credit to non-priority sectors
was also tightly controlled by BNR through a system of prior approval, and coffee financing was
syndicated among commercial banks through BNR directives. Finally, in 1991, Central Bank rules
governing maximum bank exposure in medium and long-term lending, which were originally designed
to ensure sound lending practices, were converted into credit targets. The latter could be met by
including amounts lent to the Government. BNR policies stifled the development of money and capital
markets, and restricted competition among banks through specialization. As a result, Rwanda has no
interbank market and non-bank financial intermediaries face a number of restrictions on borrowing and
lending. Government securities are not tradeable and are purchased primarily by the banks and the social
security fund, which hold them to maturity. The Government started moving away from these policies
starting in 1987 with the despecialization of banks and financial institutions.
9.           Starting in 1990, the Government began taking steps to move to a system which will
depend on indirect methods of control of money and credit aggregates. In November 1990, the prior
approval system for bank credits was eliminated. BNR also began setting targets for monetary
aggregates, controlled through separate credit ceilings for banks, thus replacing the system of selective
credit controls. These policies are being revised, and new policies and instruments introduced as a result
of agreements reached in connection with the proposed FSAC.
Interest Rate Policies
10.          Lending interest rates were generally positive in real terms through most of the 1980s
when measured relative to the consumer price index for Kigali (maximum lending rates were 12 percent
and the minimum deposit rate was 3.5 percent). They turned negative in real terms, however, towards
the end of the decade as a result of mounting inflation. A policy of maintaining positive real interest rates
has been agreed upon with the Government, as discussed below. In addition, in November 1990, the
interest rate structure was simplified through the elimination of differential rates, and interest rate levels
were increased substantially. The rediscount rate was set at 14 percent, a maximum lending rate
established at 19 percent (i.e., rediscount rate plus a maximum 5 percent margin), and the minimum rate
for 12-month deposits set at 12 percent. Inflation expectations for 1991 had been projected at 28 percent
(average of 1991 over average of 1990) by the Bank and Fund, reflecting largely the expected impact of
the November 1990 devaluation. In actual fact, inflation decelerated sharply during 1991, and averaged
15 percent for the year.
11.          In June 1992, maximum lending and minimum deposit rates were reduced because of the
deceleration of inflation. The rediscount rate was reduced to 11 percent, and the maximum lending rate
automatically dropped to 16 percent (11 + 5 percent); the minimum rate of a 12-month deposit was
reduced to 9 percent. Inflation for 1993 is currently projected at 5 percent, although it may be higher
given the budgetary problems faced by the Government. However, as credit to the economy has been
low because of the political situation, actual lending by the banking sector that has resulted is not likely
to lead to high levels of inflation. Interest rates are currently positive in real terms. In its Letter of
Financial Sector Development, the Government is committed to reviewing, and if necessary, revising



- 91 -                                    Annex 8-A
Page 4 of 7
interest rates to ensure that they remain positive in real terms. In addition, the Government is committed
to full interest rate liberalization by end 1993. During negotiations of the Credit, the Govermnent
confirmed, in writing, its commitment to maintaining positive real interest rates.
Other Monetary Policy Instruments
12.          The Government is committed to changing direct monetary policy instruments in favor
of indirect ones, including reserve requirements, the rediscount facility at BNR and the flexible use of
interest rates. This will eliminate the need to use bank-by-bank credit ceilings with their adverse effect
on bank competition. As part of these reforms BNR introduced, in 1991, reserve requirements, initially
at a low level (one percent of deposits). BNR will review the experience of reserve requirements during
1993 with the Bank and the ultimate level will be set taking into account macroeconomic conditions and
the situation of banks. In the program it is anticipated that reserve requirements will be increased to
about five to ten percent of deposits. This gradual introduction of reserve requirements will enable both
the banks and BNR staff to become familiar with the new system, and to make adjustments to avoid a
destabilizing effect on the economy. BNR is expected to remunerate reserves above a certain minimum
to ensure that they do not constitute a tax on the banking system. As promised in the letter of Financial
Sector Development Policy: (a) in December 1991, BNR issued a statement informing the financial
institutions of changes in monetary and credit policies; and (b) beginning with the 1992-93 coffee crop
campaign (which started in March 1992) BNR discontinued its practice of allocating shares of coffee
export financing among financial institutions, and abolished the flat fee per kilogram, as a method of bank
renumeration, in favor of a normal lending rate to be negotiated with coffee marketing firms.
13.          The rediscount facility at BNR has been expanded to cover short term credit for all
sectors (not just coffee), and rediscounting procedures have been streamlined within the limits permitted
by the banking law. This has improved the ability of commercial banks to manage their own liquidity.
Also, a flexible rediscount facility will serve as a tool of monetary policy because the Central Bank will
be able to change the money supply through its lending to commercial banks. In the context of the
revision of BNR statutes, the refinance facility will be expanded further to cover long term credit, and
the statutory requirements for refinancing will be simplified.
14.          Lastly, money market instruments will be developed. A money market will help facilitate
implementation of monetary policy and it will also assist banks in managing their liquidity, which will
increase efficiency and reduce their costs of operation. To spur the establishment of money markets, a
proposed treasury bill auction system is expected to be put in place. A study on the establishment of the
treasury bill auction and on the diversification of the range of money market instruments was completed
in 1992. The appropriate timing of the treasury bill auction implementation will be discussed in the
context of the macroeconomic and financial sector reform programs.
D. Banking Lgislation, Regulation and Supervision
Current Situation
15.          Shortcomings in the legal and regulatory framework for financial institutions have
contributed to the current difficulties of the sector. As the financial system moves further towards market
mechanisms and away from direct controls, an appropriate regulatory framework will be necessary to
identify troubled institutions at an early stage as well as to create an environment conducive to greater
competition between institutions.



- 92 -
Annex 8-A
Page 5 of 7
16.          The banking law (Law of Financial Institutions) has several problems. First, BNR's
power to request information from financial institutions is restricted, leading to protracted discussions
between the banks and BNR. Second, the law does not provide BNR with sufficient autonomy from the
Ministry of Finance; indeed, the Minister of Finance has the power to reverse most BNR decisions,
including those dealing with bank licensing. Third, the minimum capital required for establishing a new
bank needs to be raised to come into line with international standards and the criteria for determining
capital adequacy need to be revised. Fourth, the legislation does not provide for penalties in case of non-
compliance with the banking law and prudential regulations. Finally, amendments are necessary to tailor
some of the regulations to small operations of the individual members of the Union des Banques
Populaires, the association of savings and loan cooperatives.
17.          Implementation of the existing law has been uneven, in part because BNR has not issued
supporting instructions and regulations to the banks. Supervisory capabilities at BNR are also in their
infancy. BNR has begun tackling these problems, as discussed below.
18.          Substantial efforts are also necessary to improve accounting standards in Rwanda.
Rwanda has no local independent auditors and most institutions (including the banks) have relied on
having their financial accounts certified rather than audited. While national charts of accounts exist for
enterprises, their use has not been enforced. Consequently, companies present their accounts in a wide
variety of formats, and reliability of the accounts is suspect.
Reform Program: the Legal and Regulatory Framework and Bank Supervision
19.          The reform of the regulatory and legal framework is underway as part of the financial
sector reform program of the Government. BNR already has begun changing, (within the existing law)
the regulations on provisioning, setting clear guidelines on when and how much to provide and when and
how to deal with interest accruals on non-performing loans. In addition, the banking legislation
(Financial Institutions Law and BNR Statutes) is being revised, (a draft sent to the Bank and the Fund
has been commented upon). The revised legislation will give clear authority to BNR over all financial
institutions, and will spell out the policy instruments that will enable BNR to conduct monetary policy,
including the rediscount of long term credit. The revised legislation will include provisions for BNR to
have a clear mandate over the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, including licensing of
financial institutions as well as to set appropriate minimum capital requirements. A minimum capital-
adequacy ratio, in line with international standards, will also be established, taking into account quality
and type of risk assets of banks, including off-balance sheet risks. Further changes in the regulations
regarding the classification of loans by risk category, the treatment of non-performing loans, appropriate
provisions and interest accrual guidelines will also be implemented. Limits will be set on bank's
exposure to a single customer or group. In addition, external audits of all financial institutions will be
required every year. As a first step, BNR requested external audits of the 1991 accounts of all banking
institutions. These have now been completed. BNR has issued instructions to that effect and defined the
terms of reference for future audits.
20.          For BNR to carry out, effectively, its role of monitoring and preserving the health of the
financial system, the skills, training, staffing and methodology of its Inspection Department are being
strengthened. The Inspection Department has already been expanded to include five professionals. In
addition, supervision and training plans have been prepared and are being implemented. The initial
inspections of commercial banks will be undertaken with the help of external advisors. An IMF advisor
is assisting with the simplification of existing regulations and with the strengthening of the Inspection

Page 6 of 7
Department. Technical Assistance in this area has also, been discussed jointly between BNR, the Bank
and the Swiss aid agency, and an implementation program agreed to in principle.
E. Supply and Demand for Term Credit
21.          In the past, credit (especially short-term) did not present a constraint to the development
of enterprises in the modern sector, although this situation has changed dramatically in the past three
years, as banks began to curtail lending when faced with growing portfolio losses. The despecialization
of banks introduced in 1987 had an impact on credit distribution. BRD no longer enjoys a virtual
monopoly of investment financing, and enterprises can shop around and negotiate best terms for
investment loans from one of the three commercial banks. The latter's capacity for term lending is
limited only by lack of adequately matched resources, and to a lesser extent, by BNR's prudential
regulations.
22.          Under BNR term lending ratio applicable to commercial banks, the latter must limit term
lending, investment in government securities and equity participation to an amount proportional to equity
funds (net of non-performing loans) plus percentages of deposits varying from 25 percent of sight to 100
percent of term deposits of 12 months and above. Relatively high exposure in 5-year development bonds
and other term loans limit banks' capacity to significantly increase term loans on the basis of their own
resources. The proposed IDA Credit would therefore be welcome as BNR regulations would not be
applicable to term loans funded by long term resources. In fact BCR and BK have written to IDA to
confirm their interest and desire to participate in the proposed line of Credit. When this BNR prudential
ratio is applied to the three commercial banks, their theoretical potential for term loans stood at the
following estimated amounts as of December 31, 1991:
BK:          RwF2,378 million (US$18.3 million)
BACAR:       RwF 404 million (US$3.1 million)
BCR:         0
23.          With the proposed reform of the Special Guaranty Fund, small- and medium-enterprises
would have greater access to institutional term lending. In addition to the Guaranty Fund, the new
liberalized interest rate regime is progressively encouraging banks to increase term lending. As has been
the case in the recent past in most African countries, small scale enterprises have had little access to
credit from the banking system due to low administered lending rates and lack of guaranties for high risk
operations. As agriculture, agro-processing and other small service enterprises are likely to provide the
greatest opportunities for employment in the near- and medium-term, increasing access to credit for
private, and especially small and medium-scale enterprises will be critical to renewing growth in the
Rwandese economy. BRD is expected to retain its leadership position in the financing of medium and
larger modern enterprises but it is expected to syndicate most of its future loans with commercial banks,
particularly as it enters short-term loan business which, by nature, must likewise be syndicated.
24.          Investment Financing Demand. Implementation of investment plans and projects is
currently constrained by the ongoing political reform process. Because of delays in investment for the
past three years, demand is likely to pick up sharply as the political crisis is resolved, following the
signature of the peace accord in August 1993. Several projects under implementation have been stopped
due to transportation difficulties for imported equipment and material, and limited supply of locally
produced or imported inputs. In spite of these factors, investors remain guardedly optimistic and are
eagerly awaiting the expected end of the political stalemate to resume investment activities. There exists



- 94 -                                     Annex 8-A
Page 7 of 7
an important pipeline of investment projects, in addition to a growing demand for financial restructuring
and rehabilitation of several enterprises in difficulty. BRD's pipeline of projects under study includes
some 70 investment proposals estimated to require RwF935 million (US$7.2 million) in term loans. The
Ministry of Commerce and Industry has also produced a list of 60 projects which have been studied and
approved. Implementation of many of these projects stopped during to the civil strife, and additional
updating studies and financing are required to complete them, if their viability is established. These
projects are estimated to require RwFS.1 billion (US$40 million) in investment loans. Assuming a
conservative casualty rate of 50 percent of these projects would lead to a potential demand of US$20
million in term loans. Another source of investment demand would come from enterprises in financial
or technical difficulties due to various factors including the economic downturn and stiffer competition
from imports. Such enterprises will require financial restructuring, in particular a shoring up of their
permanent working capital. IDA funds could be used to refinance term loans to import spare-parts, raw
material and other semi-finished intermediate inputs. Such term loans would strengthen the capitalization
structure of viable entities and generate some working capital. Demand in this area has not been
estimated but a list of 27 medium- and large-enterprises in difficulties was prepared jointly by BRD and
Ministry of Commerce and Industry for the purpose of setting up an Industrial Rehabilitation Fund. The
indebtedness of these enterprises amounted to RwF2.2 billion (US$17 million) as of September 30, 1992.
Assuming that 25 percent of those debts are short term facilities would lead to an estimated US$4 million
in potential term financing. Excluding SSEs and rural/urban micro enterprises, investment financing
demand in the modem sector could range from US$7 million to US$20 million, for investment in
productive facilities, and US$4 million in working capital requirements.  Estimated demand for
investment could reach $30 million in the modem sector alone for next two to three years.
F. Flnancial Sector Development StraWtei
25.           The development of the financial sector is critical to successful implementation of the
Government's structural adjustment program, and in particular, will contribute to facilitating efficient
investment and spurring new growth. The strategy for the development of the financial sector includes:
(a) reliance on market-determined interest rates and indirect instruments of monetary control and the
elimination of direct controls on credit; (b) the strengthening and restructuring of existing financial
institutions to make them more competitive and efficient; and (c) the introduction of sound regulatory and
supervisory practices in the Central Bank. The key objective of Rwanda's financial sector strategy is to
create a sound policy environment and a solid institutional framework appropriate to the current needs
of the private sector as both saver and investor. As part of this strategy, the Government will also reduce
its direct ownership of financial institutions and promote greater competition between institutions. Strong
and competitive commercial banks, a small interbank and money market, a competitive
development/investment bank and an efficient network of rural savings and loans institutions, are likely
to meet the economy's needs for the medium-term. In the longer term, once the existing institutions have
become stronger and more efficient, and as the Rwandese private sector grows and diversifies, there may
be scope for greater expansion within the financial sector.
26.           The Credit will help implement this strategy and will support both policy and institutional
reforms in Rwanda's financial system. It is also a critical component of its overall structural adjustment
program as detailed in the current PFP. These reforms are designed to make Rwanda's financial system
more efficient and market-oriented, thereby enabling it to support the increased investment needed to meet
its economic growth objectives. They will lead to more competition within the system and stronger
institutions, an increased breadth of financial instruments and greater flexibility in the pricing of financial
services.

PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Financial Intermediaries
A. Commercial Banks
Ownership and Management
1.           There are three privately controlled and operated commercial banks, two of which, BCR,
a Banque Bruxelles Lambert subsidiary, and Banque de Kigali (BK), a Belgolaise-Societe Generale de
Belgique subsidiary, have sizeable government participation. The third commercial bank, BACAR is
wholly privately controlled and operated by local and foreign investors led by Banque Continentale du
Luxembourg. Although the Government and public sector entities control 44.5, 50, and 4 percent of the
capital of BCR, BK, and BACAR, respectively. The three foreign partners manage and provide technical
assistance to the three banks. Management practices inherited from parent banks still apply, including
operational, accounting, auditing and lending procedures. The parent companies' european offices
regularly carry out periodic internal audits of operations, accounts and credits. A detailed review of these
procedures shows them to be comprehensive and up to date, and more importantly, they are consistently
being applied by the subsidiary banks. The accounts of all banks were audited in 1991 by external
auditors.
2.           In 1992, the senior management of the three commercial banks numbered 17 officers,
including five expatriates, and middle management and professionals numbered 131 Rwandese. The same
year the three banks had 820 clerical staff. Commercial bank staffing, managerial and organizational
structures have also been reviewed and found in all banks to be satisfactory and efficient. Staff and
managerial training and upgrading are generally lacking in all banks. Due to the high income taxation
rates that make them rather cost conscious, most banks are generally unwilling to invest significantly in
staff training and upgrading activities. (para. 7).
Financial Position and Performance
3.           Deposits and Liquidity. The higher deposit renumeration rates, along with the political
situation which discouraged spending and investnient, have resulted in increased deposit levels in banks,
which amounted to RwF27.4 billion ($210 million) in 1991. Deposits grew by 15 percent in 1991,
compared to 1.7 percent in 1990. Total deposits also grew in 1992, reaching RwF 32.0 billion (US$228
million) as of December 31, 1992, an increase of 16.8 percent. Commercial bank deposits, which
accounted for 78 percent of the total (the balance was held by the savings institutions) and amounted to
RwF21.4 billion ($165 million), grew by about 26 percent in 1991. In 1992 such deposits increased
again by 19 percent to reach RwF 25.5 billion (US$180 million). The increase in deposits has come at
a time when banks curtailed lending, because of reduced demand resulting from the macroeconomic
situation. Banks were also reluctant to lend to any but their best clients, as they cleaned their portfolio.
Consequently, the liquidity of banks increased in 1992. Commercial banks, particularly BK, also resorted
to more borrowing from their correspondents in order to finance coffee marketing operations and decrease
cost as BNR rediscount rate was high for most of the period.

amounted to RwF29.6 million (US$228 million), including RwF15.4 million ($118 million) in credit to
the economy, and RwF4.3 million ($33 million) in investments in government securities (Annex 8-C
Tables A8.1 and A8.2). Commercial banks account for about 68 percent of banking system credit to the
economy. Following the 1987 despecialization of banks, commercial banks increased their medium- and
long-term loan portfolio by 50 percent during 1987-89. Term loans accounted for 35 percent of
commercial bank portfolios in 1991. Commercial banks have also increased their exposure in government
security and cut back lending to enterprises and individuals where risks have worsened following the
economic downturn. In 1991, while commercial bank deposits rose by 26 percent, their loan portfolio
grew only by 11 percent, and investments in higher yield government securities by 25.5 percent. Short-
term credit increased substantially by 46 percent at the end of 1992, reflecting mainly arrears of
payments, for in the annual coffee campaign financing. Credit for the 1992 coffee campaign was
financed exclusively by BK and amounted to a RwF2,137 million (US$15 million) advance to Rwandex,
as of December 31, 1992 the country's private coffee exporter, which has had a long standing banking
relation with BK and its European parent bank. The structure of assets in the banking system is detailed
below.

5.           Loan Portfojio. The deteriorating macroeconomic situation has had an adverse impact
on the banks' portfolios. The non-performing portfolio of the commercial banks increased from 5.3
percent of total portfolio in 1987 to 15.6 percent in 1990, and 21.7 percent in 1991 (Annex 8-C Table
A8.3). The share of non-performing loans is unevenly distributed between banks, with BACAR having
the largest portion. The non-performing portfolio is likely to remain relatively high because of the
political problems that the country is facing. BK does not currently have problems, although it has a very
high temporary exposure in coffee (para. 4). Given the volume of financing required for the coffee
campaign, and its self-liquidating nature, bank exposures to a single customer always reach exceptionally
high levels during the campaign. BACAR has serious portfolio problems that stemmed from its first
years of operation when its original management team, not fully familiar with the market, gave large
loans to a few clients. BACAR policies have changed since that time, although it has not yet completely

Annex 8-B
Page 4 of 11
resolved the portfolio problems. Banks allocated a greater share of their income to provisions which
grew by 21.5 percent in 1991.
6.           There are other factors that affect the evolution of the non-performing portfolio. Foremost
among these is the inefficient process of guaranty constitution and realization imposed by administrative
and judicial institutions. There are hundreds of guaranties to be registered and legalized still pending at
the Ministry of Public Works' Urban Department and Ministry of Justice's Notary Public Department.
Administrative problems are compounded by unclear commercial and business legislations. The
complicated procedures delay loan recovery litigations which are treated on an ad hoc basis by the same
courts that handle commercial as well as civil and criminal litigations. This cumbersome process
considerably slows down all commercial litigations. According to the Banking Association, there are over
700 loan litigation cases pending in the Rwandese courts, of which more than 550 have been under
litigation for over five years. Banks favor the creation of a separate Tribunal of Commerce and the
establishment of private auxiliaries of justice (e.g., process-servers, auctioneers, liquidators) in order to
alleviate the problem and speed loan recovery procedures. Secondly, guaranties granted to banks by the
Government-controlled Special Guaranty Fund (para. 20)-for small scale enterprise lending, are not
being honored by the Government and BNR. The loans guaranteed by FSG and under litigation amount
to RwF230.4 million (US$1.8 million) for BCR and RwF43.5 million ($334,000) for BRD. During
negotiations agreement was reached with the Government on the following initiatives:
(i)    as a condition of disbursement, create staff and render operational within a year an
autonomous Tribunal of Commercial.
(ii)    As a condition of disbursement reduction of the number of loan litigation cases pending
in the commercial courts according to an agreed timetable.
(iii)   As a condition of disbursement, submission of an acceptable schedule of reimbursement
of FSG arrears.
7.           A third problem affecting the portfolio quality of commercial banks relates to unfavorable
fiscal regulations that do not allow deduction of loan loss provisions, and that impose high taxation of
operating profits. In fact, banks have tended to understate the extent of problem loans in their portfolio
so as to justify lower provisions for risks. Banks have been able to do so partly because, until 1991, their
financial accounts were not independently audited, and partly because BNR does not have a clearly
established loan classification system by risk categories or guidelines for provisioning. In the Letter of
Financial Sector Policy, the Government is committed to legalizing tax-deductibility of provisions for
risks on bank loans.
8.           CaDital Adequacy Ratio.  Estimated 1991 capital adequacy ratios calculated during
appraisal are detailed in Annex 8-C Table A8.6 and summarized below for the three commercial banks,
and the development bank.

9.           BACAR. As seen above, with the exception of BACAR, the banks that will act as
financial intermediaries under the Credit have adequate equity capital funds to meet internationally
accepted levels of risk capital coverage. However, as banks tend to understate problem loans, the
estimated capital surpluses shown may offset additional loan loss provisioning requirements that a more
thorough loan audit may recommend in future. The auditors of BACAR estimate shortfalls in loan
provisions required at some RwF600 million (US$4.6 million) which its management does not agree with,
arguing that most of the loans in question are adequately covered by real guaranties, and that prospects
for their recovery are good. In view of this uncertainty, BACAR's eligibly as a participating financial
intermediary will have to be reviewed on the basis of its 1992 audited financial statements, and of the
adequacy of both its capital ratio and levels of provisions for risks.
10.          Bangue de Kaj. BK's exposure in coffee advances to a single customer, Rwandex, was
earlier of deep concern when it reached RwF2.137 million (US$9.3 million), in December 1992. Coffee
marketing and export financing advances are being funded by BK with its own resources and with an
advance from its parent bank (guaranteed by chattel mortgaging of coffee export proceeds), rather than
through BNR refinancing. Such coffee operations are normally self-liquidating and until last year were
financed by BK and BCR who have always taken the commercial risk with the implicit guarantee of the
Government. The Government has always honored its obligations to the banks resulting from the
subsidies to coffee producers, and it can be expected that it will do so again this year, albeit with some
difficulties. In view of its importance for the Rwandese economy, the coffee issue is being closely
monitored, in the context of the on-going macroeconomic dialogue between the Government, Bank, IMF
and other donors. BK's exposure was substantially decreased to RwF345 million (US$1.5 million) at end
of March 1993, with no BNR refinancing. The coffee stabilization Fund transferred enough resources
to meet its commitments and to subsidize coffee marketing operations.
11.          Frofitabiliy. As shown in Annex 8-C Tables A8.7 and A8.9, commercial banks'
profitability has been declining over the past four years; profits before tax fell by about 24 percent and
profits after tax declined by about one-third. During 1991, however, thanks to the sharp increases in
lending rates, and the elimination of the lending limits on banks, commercial bank net profits doubled
to reach RwF122 million (US$940,000) compared to RwF58 million (US$446,000) in 1990.
Deteriorating economic conditions, past interest rate policies, increased taxes and the October 1990
hostilities have all contributed to the poor performance of the banks through 1990. Past interest rate
policies, which imposed preferential interest rates on some activities while putting a cap on the quantity
of credit which could be given at non-preferential rates, reduced the interest margins of banks. High
taxes, which include compulsory allocations of 10 percent of operating profits to FSG, the government
guarantee fund for small enterprises, further contributed to the declining financial performance of banks
1/    For BRD a 10% capital adequacy ratio i required

Page 6 of 11
(in 1990, profits before tax were 23 percent of equity while profits after tax amounted to only 9 percent).
Finally, the October 1990, political events reduced business activity and made loan collections, especially
in rural areas, more difficult. An improving profitability trend seems to be emerging following reform
of interest rate policies, and needs to be sustained to enable banks to generate sufficient profits for
provisioning and reinforcement of their equity bases.
B. Development Bank - Banque Rwandalse de Development
12.          The development bank of Rwanda, BRD, was created in 1967, and has been the main
source of investment financing in Rwanda until 1987. It has been the exclusive beneficiary of four IDA
Credits since 1979; the last Credit (No. 1650-RW) of US$9 million, was approved on January 14, 1986,
and became effective October 31, 1986. The Credit is 100 percent committed, and 75 percent disbursed,
and is expected to be closed before the original target date of December 31, 1993. Project Completion
Reports (Nos.4921 and 8799-RW) dated February 10, 1984 and June 28, 1990, on the first IDA credit
(no.655-RW), and the Second and Third IDA Credits (Nos. 896-RW and 1344-RW), respectively, were
circulated to the Board. The two PCRs concluded generally that the first two IDA Credits focused on
institution building, and economic development objectives and achieved satisfactory results. However
it was also stresed that these operations failed to address issues affecting overall financial sector
performance, or its impact on the real economy. Hence, a broader sectoral approach, through Apex
operations, was recommended for future financial intermediary operations.
13.          Ownership and Managgmnt. At end 1991, BRD had total assets of RwF4,680.7 million
($36 million), of which RwF3,756.9 million ($29 million) in term loans, accounting for about 8 percent
of banking sector assets (excluding BNR). BRD has also been the sole beneficiary of substantial foreign
exchange resources from its bilateral agency shareholders, which, when added to its virtual monopoly
on term lending for investment, gave it prestige in the business community of Rwanda (para. 15). BRD's
capital is controlled 59 percent by the Government (50%) and public entities (9%) while bilateral
development agencies (e.g., Caisse Francaise de Developpement, ex. CCCE, DEG, AGCD, etc.,) and
local private investors (including the two commercial banks, BCR and BK, with 2.28 percent each) hold
the balance of 29.4 and 11.6 percent, respectively. The Government appointed general manager leads
a team of relatively competent managers. The staff of 107 includes 25 professionals. BRD's
management, lending, accounting and internal auditing procedures are well known to the Bank through
a long association and intensive supervision. These procedures, and the quality of management and staff
have generally remained satisfactory, while day-to-day management and decision-making, which are
characterized by a very conservative and prudent approach, do not raise any issue. However, the
worsening portfolio problems that the institution faces requires a restructuring of BRD's operations,
managerial organization and staffing level.
14.          Leading O2aions. The evolution of BRD's lending operations is detailed below and
shows a steep decline of activities since the peak of 1988. That year BRD was put under pressure to
increase lending to the financially risky small private enterprise sector, at fixed relatively low interest
rates, without adequate institutional preparation and operational strategy to underpin the new lending
orientation. As BRD was more familiar with larger size, modern industrial concerns, not only did the
institution have problems in evaluating the risks involved in SSE financing, but the larger number of
projects thus financed resulted in a relaxation of appraisal procedures and strained BRD's portfolio
management capacities. Moreover BRD could not mobilize the required resources to fund such large
volumes of lending, thus putting additional strains to its available financial resources. As a result, the
following years, BRD had to curtail its lending activities as shown. It was too late, however, to limit
the expected damage both to the portfolio and financial situation of BRD as analyzed below.

15.          Loan and Investment Portfolio. Although BRD had generally avoided many of the
problems that have plagued development banks in other countries, it now faces a number of such
problems as a result of the aforementioned government interference in lending policies. As BRD doubled
its lending to small and medium private enterprises, in one year, and because a number of the projects
approved were of questionable viability, BRD's external donors (including IDA) declined to finance
several of them. This led BRD to finance its long-term loans with short-term refinancing facilities from
BNR the Central Bank. Moreover BRD's loan portfolio is highly concentrated by sector and geographic
location. Large industrial borrowers in the capital city, Kigali, area, and some seven enterprises account
for over 50 percent, and 40 percent of loans outstanding, respectively. Although BRD's policy statement
limits individual financial risk exposure to a maximum 20 percent of its unimpaired equity, and to 70
percent of total project costs, such concentration in few borrowers may be detrimental in the long run.
As import substituting industries account for 40 percent of the portfolio, BRD vulnerability to the slightest
economic downturn is thus quite real. The addition of a large number of financially risky, small
borrowers did not arrange matters for BRD. Not surprisingly portfolio quality and collections declined
sharply because of the worsening economic situation. Overall loan collections in principal and interest,
fell to 76 percent in 1989 and declined thereafter continuously as arrears built up and the non-performing
portfolio increased substantially as a percentage of total loan portfolio, as shown above. Overall loan
collection rates have dropped to dangerously low levels of about 33 percent when litigious loans are taken
into account. The loan portfolio, and collection problems faced by BRD, and to a lesser degree
commercial banks, also find their roots in the aforementioned administrative and legal constraints faced
by all institutional lenders (para. 6).
16.          Resource Position. IDA funds from the BRD-IV Credit (No. 1650-RW) have been fully
committed, and the undisbursed but committed balance of SDR1.3 million ($1.8 millon) is expected to
be drawn down before end 1993, as estimated during appraisal. BRD has not fully utilized most of the



- 102 -                                  Annex 8-B
Page 8 of 11
resources available from donors foreign exchange lines of credit, partly because BRD has curtailed its
lending operations, and partly because of constraints in the use of these lines. Total undisbursed
resources available for new commitments are given below and include $15 million mostly from
AfDB/ADF, $3.6 million from a Belgian Government loan, and $3.2 million from a French CCCE line
of credit. These term resources from other donors are mostly directed to specific targets (e.g.,
rural/agricultural SSEs and micro-enterprises for the AfDB), and limited in their procurement possibilities
as regard the two bilateral borrowings. IDA funds under the proposed operation would not have sectoral,
size or similar procurement constraints. Furthermore, IDA funds are expected to be also utilized for
working capital financing requirements and financial restructuring of viable private enterprises in
difficulty. As BRD resources could not cover the whole range of investment demand, particularly
projects channelled through commercial banks, an IDA line of credit of $5 million would be justified.
IDA funds will complement resources from other donors. BRD's resource position as of August 31,
1992 is presented in details below:

17.          Profitability and liguidity. The need to constitute additional loan loss provisions led BRD
to declare steep operating losses of RwF 300 million (US$2.3 million) and RwF66.3 million ($510,000)
in 1990 and 1991, respectively - the first losses in its history. The low collections and the temporary
mismatch of assets and liabilities led to a serious liquidity squeeze during 1988-90, and to the necessity
to shore up the institution's equity base through a share capital increase to which BRD shareholders
responded positively. A capital increase of RwF364 million ($2.8 million) was approved in January,



- 103 -                                   Annex 8-B
Page 9 of 11
1992, to offset the cumulated losses and maintain an adequate equity level, and has been fully subscribed
and is about 72 percent paid in. The Government, with a 50 percent share of the increase has fully paid
the RwF188 million ($1.4 million) it has subscribed. Only two donor shareholders have so far failed to
pay in. Following, and as a condition of the capital increase, BRD's Board introduced tough
restructuring measures, focusing on loan recovery activities. BRD, also, reimbursed BNR's short term
advances and was able to even place some RwF200 million ($1.5 million) in term deposits, a sure
indication that it has resolved its short-term liquidity problems. However, the current levels of loan
collection rates are not sustainable and it is likely that further operating losses will be incurred owing both
to lower operational revenues, higher allocations to provisions for risks, and maintenance of the same
staff and administrative levels of expenses. During negotiations BRD and the Government agreed on a
plan of actions to reduce operating costs and beef up provisions (para. 19).
18.          Financial Structure and ProsDects. As mentioned earlier BRD's capital base is quite
comfortable, and its risk coverage ratio more than adequate based on its 1991 financial statements,
particularly following the capital increase of January, 1992. However, the levels of provisions required
to cover risks of losses grow by the day and there is a likelihood that BRD would need to increase its
allocations to provisions, thereby further chipping away at its capital base. In addition to its current
financial difficulties, BRD is now facing the same challenges confronting development banks throughout
the world. Its traditional client base - 42 percent of which are import substitution industries - are
threatened by the adjustment program, and at the very least will need some financial restructuring. The
financial sector reforms have subjected BRD to greater competition from the commercial banks,
particularly in medium-term loans to "blue chip" companies. Consequently, BRD needs to undertake a
radical review of its vocation as development bank, diversify its lending activities, and provide new
commercial banking services and short term lending to its current customer base.
19.   However, at this stage BRD is not prepared for diversification which requires careful planning,
market studies, retraining of management and staff, redirection of lending policies, managerial
organization, accounting and internal auditing systems and procedures. To help formulate alternative
diversification scenarios a special audit and study was recently completed by a team of specialized
banking consultants. Objectives were to ascertain the level of additional required loan provisioning, and
to segregate the loan portfolio between performing, non-performing but viable, and non-performing and
irrecoverable loans, with a view to proposing different financial projection scenarios for restructuring of
the institution and diversification into commercial banking activities in the future. The major findings
and recommendations of the aforementioned study are summarized in Annex 14 and constitute an action
plan for BRD. During negotiations, agreements were be reached on a short term action plan to reduce
operating costs, which BRD has agreed to implement as a condition of eligibility.
C. Special Guaranty Fund
20.          Ownership. Management and Procedures. FSG is a loan guaranty fund created in 1978
by the Government to provide collateral guaranties to enable greater access to banking credit by small
entrepreneurs in agriculture, animal husbandry and artisanal activities. FSG has no legal personality and
is constituted by a simple credit account in the Ministry of Finance books at BNR. The fund has no
capital base and charges a 3 percent commission on loans guaranteed, which in addition to the compulsory
10 percent allocation of pre-tax operating profits of banks and financial institutions, constitute its sole
resources. Loans eligible for guaranty range from RwF5 to 10 million ($38,500 to $77, 000), and
guaranty commitments are taken on its behalf by an Oversight Committee chaired by a member appointed
by the Minister of Finance and composed of representatives of the Agriculture and Industry Ministries,
BNR and two participating banks (BRD and UBP). Day-to-day operations have been assumed by a

Director, a legal staffer, and five clerks. The operating budget was funded from 1988 to 1991 by
USAID; since then, the budget has been financed from FSG own resources.
21.          The fund's by-laws and operating regulations are not adequate with respect to the type
of guaranty granted, its coverage, the obligations of the guaranteed parties, the loan interest accounting
rules, and the trigger mechanism for the fund's guaranty to apply. The fund provides a full 100 percent
guaranty of principal and interest through a short worded letter of guaranty sent to the guaranteed bank
by the Oversight Committee. That letter of guaranty is tantamount to a co-signature of the loan being
guaranteed, since the fund commits itself implicitly to pay on first demand in lieu of the principal debtor
whenever the letter falls in arrears. The objective of the fund is to fully guaranty poorly endowed
borrowers that either do not dispose of any assets to put forward as collateral, or cannot muster any other
types of guaranties. As a result lending banks have not resisted political pressures to take risks so
guaranteed by FSG.
22.          Guaranty Operations. The Fund has so far guaranteed over 300 small loans for about
RwF 745 million (US$5.7 million), while its resources amounted to RwF623 million ($4.8 million) as
of October 30, 1992. Current claims on the fund resources amount RwF273.9 million ($2.1 million) in
non performing, irrecoverable loans guaranteed on behalf of BCR and BRD, as of October 31, 1992.
Payments of these claims would deplete 50 percent of the Fonds' resources. BNR is opposing any
payments to BCR and BRD on the ground that they did not take adequate collateral and were not diligent
in taking action to recover some of these risks. BNR also argues that many of the loans made and
guaranteed by the FSG were politically motivated and known from the beginning to be irrecoverable.
The banks are threatening legal action against the FSG and have stopped operations needing guarantees.
Furthermore, banks argue rightly that the resources of the FSG belong to them since they have been
building them up through compulsory allocations of 10 percent of pre-tax operating profits since 1978.
23.          Non-payments of guarantees by the FSG could adversely affect BRD and BCR's financial
position in view of the large loan commitments they made with that guaranty. Moreover banks lending
to the SSE sector would stop altogether if this issue is not resolved to their satisfaction. Currently banks
continue to accrue interest on such loans, a practice that may unduly increase the amounts to be paid in
future by the FSG. The by-laws and operating regulations of the FSG need to be revised and the notion
of guaranty of risk of loss introduced, and the Government and banks have agreed to such revision and
reform, and to draft terms of reference of a proposed study to that effect. As part of the study a special
audit of all loans granted under the FSG guaranty will be conducted to review the procedures behind their
approval, the diligence taken by banks to obtain other guaranties, supervise the loans, and pursue
delinquent borrowers with the means at their disposal prior to asking FSG payment. The study would
be financed under the Public Enterprise Credit (No. 2113-RW). This issue is being addressed in the
context of the FSAC. However, given the negative developments in this area, and importance of the
issue, during negotiations agreement was reached with the Government to settle this issue on terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA as a condition of disbursements under the line of credit component u
follows:
(i)   the Minister of Finance has, officially, directed BNR to effectuate payments on FSO
guaranteed bank claims.
(ii)   BNR will execute this directive and prove, to IDA and guaranteed bank satisfaction, that
payment was effectively made.

(iii)   The laws and operating regulations of the FSG will be reformed with a view to (a) reduce
the amount guaranteed to a guaranty of protection against documented losses after banks
show due diligence; (b) diminish the weight of government influence in its management;
and (c) better define trigger mechanisms and accounting rules and the type of guarantee
given.

PRIVATE SEC1Y)R DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Support to the Ministra of Commerce and Industry
Outline of the Terms of Reference
I. Introduction and Global Context
1.           The support will include financing for:
- long- and short-term, local or international, experts;
- specialized training;
- office equipment.
HL Objectives
2.           Provide the Ministry of Commerce and Industry with the means to coordinate and
ensure proper implementation of actions aimed at helping the private sector. This will include
inter alia helping the Ministry to:
- conceptualize, prepare, implement and follow-up the agreed private sector
development strategy, identify new constraints and enhance the strategy.
- Internalize and keep abreast of information, issues, and actions related to the
private sector by keeping appropriate documentation on studies and donor
actions.
- Enhance the quality and the depth of the dialogue with the private sector.
m. Specfic Tasks
Implementin2 the Private Sector Development Strategy
3.           At first the primary priority will be to ensure timely and effective implementation
of the reform program agreed to during negotiations and outlined in the policy matrix. As these
objectives are attained new elements of the strategy should be identified and the appropriate
reform measures proposed and implemented. In particular the team of long term consultants
should:
- help ministerial staff prepare the required documentation and background
documents to specify the modalities of the policy reforms, ensures that the
appropriate measures are taken, and assess their impact.
- Advise the Minister of any delays, shortcoming in implementation, and
problems encountered and propose solutions.

Page 2 of 2
- Recommend how the strategy should evolve once all the agreed measures are
implemented, particularly during and after Mid-term review.
Gaining Knowledge About the Private Sector
4.           The team of long term consultants should within about one year of credit
effectiveness undertake the efforts necessary to gain a better understanding, primarily on the basis
of existing documents, of the private sector's structure, performance, issues and constraints by:
- compiling a comprehensive library and bibliography of all studies and surveys
related to private sector activities in industry and services, as well as
compiling all economic, legal and regulatory texts with an impact to the
business environment.
- Create a database containing the available statistics and the aforementioned
bibliography.
- Adopt appropriate mechanisms to engage the private sector in an effective
dialogue, receive and answer their complaints, and if required propose
solutions which can be adopted with the help of the Government or
international donors.
Monitoring and coordination of donor activities
5.           To ensure that the Ministry is informed of donor activities and is given an
opportunity to provide appropriate inputs into such efforts, drawing on the lessons from past
experience, the team of consultants should:
- collect and analyze all relevant information concerning donor initiatives,
including appraisal, supervision, restructuring and completion reports. Such
information would be entered in the aforementioned database.
- Assess the impact of each initiative, its shortcomings and achievements, on the
basis of documents provided.
- Be actively involved in a dialogue with donors so as to ensure that to the
extent possible lessons from the past are incorporated in the design of new
operations and that unnecessary duplication of efforts is avoided.
- Propose new initiatives and studies.
Training the Ministerial staff
6.           Training will be provided in part on the job by the consultants who will be
expected to ensure that ministerial staff are conversant with what they are doing and can before
the end of the project take over the functions temporarily provided by experts financed by the
project. In addition, a specific training program to be provided by specialists will be developed
for ministerial staff whose educational background and experience meets the minimum that is
required for their benefitting from the training.

RWANDESE REPUBLIC
pRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Survey of Consultancy Funds
I. Background
1.           The PSSF component proposed herein is the latest in a growing series initiatives, not only
in World Bank fimded projects but also some which are sponsored by other donors or governments,
containing a component with a fund which subsidizes part of the cost of expert advice to the private
sector. In such approaches, private entrepreneurs are encouraged to take the initiative of hiring private
management consultants to help them become more efficient and competitive, and thus invest and grow.
At first, these funds primarily targeted export oriented firms, as part of an export development project,
and replaced the previous model of creating public sector promotion agencies which, except for rare
exceptions, were proven to be ineffective.'
2.            During the past few years, it has been increasingly recognized that, particularly in the
least developed countries, the private sector as a whole would benefit from improved practices. Pilot
programs have thus been developed during the past few years that with significantly broader scope. Such
schemes tend to be open to all types of firms, particularly small- and medium-enterprises as well as
private sector associations. More specialized funds, for exporters or aimed at encouraging technological
acquisition, are thus promotional tools adopted by the governments of more advanced economies,
including in a number of industrialized countries.
3.            All of these programs, be they in Asia, South America, Africa or Europe, including those
reviewed below or others sponsored by different donors or governments, have in common that they
recognize the importance of the entrepreneur's initiative as a key to success. Rather than offering a
predetermined range of expertise they leave it to the entrepreneurs to define their needs. Moreover, all
of these schemes rely on the private sector to deliver the services and insist that the recipients pay a
significant portion of the costs. A number of Bank financed funds are reviewed below and the PSSF has
been designed drawing on the lessons of their success and identified shortcomings.

II. Selected World Bank Exoerdence
Case 1 - South Asia
Project 1
4.           One of the earliest schemes sponsored by the Bank was a 1985 industrial and export
project which contained two consultancy funds: the Export Marketing Fund and the Productivity Fund,
each of US$10 million. The Export Marketing Fund intended to support engineering products with a high
export potential. Such activities as market research, product adaptation, travel, training and travel to
India by potential buyers would be eligible for a subsidy of up to 50 percent of total costs. The
Productivity Fund targeted firms with export prospects and would finance up to 50 percent of the cost
of consultancies in productivity and quality improvement. Individual firms, groups of firms and
engineering associations could apply and a single project could receive up to US$200,000 in subsidy.
5.           Both funds were managed by banks who maintained a roster of consultants and kept the
permanent staff managing the funds to a minimum. Each fund was supervised by a steering committee
composed of representatives from the Government and the private sector. Perhaps the biggest innovation
was that the approval procedures were kept as simple as possible with much of the authority left to the
management teams. The respective steering committees retained the right to approve proposals involving
more than US$50,000 in the case of the Export Marketing Fund, and more than US$100,000 with the
Productivity Fund.
6.           The project was completed in 1992, two and a half years later than foreseen. During the
start-up phase, the project ran into considerable delays caused primarily by difficulties in designing
appropriate procedures, finding qualified staff, and government restrictions on obtaining foreign currency
to fund foreign consultants and travel abroad. Once the Government eased these restrictions in mid-1987,
the rate of grant commitment accelerated. In the course of the project both funds relaxed their eligibility
criteria somewhat which further increased the interest in the project.
7.           By project completion the 2 funds had financed 359 grants to 292 firms totalling US$16
million, which represented a disbursement rate of 80 percent. The project was nonetheless considered
a success. The recipients of the Export Marketing Fund and the Productivity Fund reported on average
an annual export growth of 68 percent and 48 percent respectively. Both percentages far exceeded the
national average. Other positive effects that were noted among the recipient firms included an increase
in capacity utilization rates, a reduction in rejection rates and in general, a more sharpened focus on the
need to improve efficiency and become more responsive to the demands of foreign customers. The
Project Completion Report concluded that this change in thinking could well prove to be of critical
importance to the long term competitiveness of the recipient firms.
8.           The experience with the above project was incorporated in the design of the 1989 ongoing
export development project. This project includes 4 consultancy funds totalling US$20 million. A wide
range of activities are eligible for a support of up to 50 percent provided they form part of an approved
export development plan. An export development plan is expected to cover three phases: market
exploration, product adaptation and sales promotion. Activities eligible for support include: desk and



- 130 -                                    Annex 13
Page 3 of 6
field market research, product redesign, overseas travel, product inspection services, training,
consultancies and travel to the country by potential buyers. Not more than one export expansion plan
per firm can be financed and the cumulative grant support cannot exceed US$500,000.
9.           The two original banks each continued to manage one fund, and the other two funds are
managed by two commercial banks. Again, the approval procedures are kept to a minimum and each
bank is expected to set up a separate internal unit staffed by a small number of export development
specialists to manage the program.
10.          At the time of this writing, it is not yet clear how well the new project is performing.
Experience has shown that it is difficult to design objective criteria for success for this type of assistance.
Each fund is expected to generate incremental exports of at least ten times the total value of the grant
support. Experience with the first project would indicate that the recipient firms will safely exceed this
target, but these indicators are clearly affected by other factors such as government policies, company
management, and general economic conditions, all of which may contribute to improved performance as
well. Nevertheless, the beneficiaries' performance is expected to exceed that of its local competitors.
Case 2 - East Asia
Ewject I
11.          An export development project, started in 1986, provided on a trial basis US$7.9 million
for an export support fund. This fund was intended to promote non-oil exports by subsidizing four types
of activities: all aspects of export marketing and production management; firm specific training; technical
assistance to organizations servicing the export community; and small equipment purchases. Firms with
export potential and profit-making export organizations could qualify for a subsidy of up to 75 percent
and non-profit organizations for a subsidy of up to 100 percent. Total support for a single proposal could
go as high as US$300,000.
12.          The fund was managed by the Export Support Board (ESB), an autonomous body whose
chairman and a majority of its members would be recruited from the private sector. The ESB was
usisted by a small secretariat, five project officers and two senior technical advisors. The entire staff
was recruited from the private sector and paid private sector salaries. The secretariat was to maintain
a list of eligible service suppliers and establish a range of acceptable fees. The intention was that after
three years the private sector would be encouraged to take over the management of the fund on a self-
financing basis.
13.          At project completion in 1991, ESB had signed 308 contracts, assisting 186 companies
and 20 export support organizations. Ihis project also experienced considerable delays which were
caused by an application approval process that proved much slower than expected. At project completion,
only 68 percent of the funds originally committed had been disbursed. With simplified approval
procedures and more clearly defined responsibilities, it was reckoned that each project officer could have
concluded an average of 4 contracts per month compared to their actual monthly rate of 2.5 contracts.
14.          Otherwise, this project was considered to be a success. A sample of recipient firms
reported that the value of their exports had increased 14.3 times the total cost of the assistance.
Consultancies on how to increase productivity, improve product quality and install better accounting

systems were found to be particularly useful. Nevertheless, a majority of the firms interviewed objected
to the idea of having to pay full price for the services and at project completion it was unclear whether
the scheme could be continued on a self-sustaining basis.
Project 2
15.          Experience with the above was continued in 1989 with a small and medium industrial
enterprise project. This project is essentially a credit program but contains as one of its components a
US$13.6 million consultancy fund. The project targets small and medium-scale manufacturing and agro-
processing enterprises and the fund supports such activities as feasibility analyses, business plans, loan
applications, market research, production analyses and management audits. The project funds up to 60
percent of the costs with a maximum of US$10,000 per assignment.
16.          The fund is managed by a newly created Technical Assistance Unit (TAU) which is
lodged in a banking development institute which is generally considered to be a strong, autonomous and
neutral institution. This unit maintains a roster of approved service suppliers which includes government
institutes, universities, NGO's and private firms.
17.          As was the case with the other projects, this fund ran into considerable delays at the
outset and operations did not effectively commence until almost one year after effectiveness. TAU has
been criticized for its low approval rate, sometimes taking as much as 9 months to process an application.
But procedures have been improved and at the current approval rate of 20 applications per month, it is
expected that the target of 520 interventions will be met by project completion in 1993.
18.          Perhaps not surprisingly, since the consultancy fund is an integral part of a credit project,
most of the consultancies have involved feasibility studies. But following mixed feed-back from the
recipients on the usefulness and value of feasibility studies, TAU has started to emphasize technical
assistance on other subjects such as marketing, accounting and production management. There are clear
indications that the fund is meeting a pent-up demand since TAU continues to receive requests even
though the credit line has been exhausted. It is expected that a follow-up project would include a
technical assistance component that would be patterned after the current one.
Case 3 - Latin American
19.          In 1990, US$4.8 million technical assistance fund was included as part of a private
enterprise development project. This fund is intended to provide assistance to groups of entrepreneurs
or individual firms and private sector institutions. Grants would finance consulting services, equipment
purchase, study trips, preparation of studies and training programs. Each beneficiary receives a non-
reimbursable contribution of up to 80 percent of the costs of the activity.
20.          Over the three years of the project, the fund plans to assist 450 firms and prepare at least
30 investment profiles. In addition, the fund would: organize 80 technical assistance seminars reaching
1600 entrepreneurs; develop publications, training materials and market studies; organize study trips;
provide assistance to private sector institutions that intend to restructure themselves; and provide
management training, in particular to women entrepreneurs.



- 132 -                                      Annex 13
Page 5 of 6
21.          The central bank financos US$1.4 million out of the total budget of US$4.8 million from
the fee it earns on a US$14 million IDA credit line. The balance is funded by a US$2 million loan from
IDA, contribudons from beneficiaries totalling US$0.5 million and the US$0.9 million proceeds from a
surcharge to the users of the credit line.
22.          As was the cue with the consultancy funds reviewed above, this fund has been designed
to be demand driven and to avoid as much as possible the establishment of new bureaucratic structures.
The fund is therefore administered by an existing unit within the central bank. Two long-term
international consultants have been contracted to assess proposals, verify expenditures and administer the
fund's financial resources.
23.          Indications are however, that the institutional location of the fund within the Central Bank
has not been conducive to an efficient operation of the scheme. Preliminary conclusions have also
pointed out the need for good accounting and auditing systems to combat the potential for fraud which
this type of assistance evidently entails. Although the impact of the assistance has not yet been assessed,
the demand for it is clearly exceeding the available funds. So much so that means are currently being
explored of transferring some of the funds of the credit line, which is experiencing a disappointing
demand, to the technical assistance fund.
Case 4 - Recent African Experience
Qjl1
24.          In 1991 the concept of the consultancy fund was introduced in East Africa as part of an
export development project. This project includes on a pilot basis for two years a US$3.6 million
technical assistance fund which is patterned after the aforementioned consultancy funds in Asia.
25.          Prior to this project, the Ministry of Commerce ran a program to assist exporters which
included trade fairs, publicity campaigns, information services and training. The program was generally
considered to be ineffective because of budgetary constraints, its bureaucratic orientation and lack of
accountability to the private sector. Moreover, the range of skills that are required to design, produce
and market export quality goods was not available within such a single source and the private sector was
considered as more effective in providing these services.
26.          Hence, the grant scheme finances the provision of consultancy services from competing
private sector sources. Services that would qualify include: market research and exploration, product and
packaging design, product inspection and quality control systems, cost reduction methods, travel, training,
pre-investment studies, and establishing distribution and seling operations in export markets. The fund
subsidizes up to 50 percent of the costs of an agreed upon enterprise level export development program.
It was expected that grants would average US$10,000 and that the fund would support 140 interventions
during the 2-year period.
27.          The fund is administered by a 2-person staff and is lodged at a commercial bank. The
Government is expected to contribute US$0.2 million in local operating costs, beneficiaries would
participate for US$1.4 million and the remainder US$2 million would be lend to the Government by IDA.



- 133 -
Annex 13
Page 6 of 6
28.          Although the fund was expected to support 140 interventions during a 2-year period, by
August 1992, only 4 grants had been executed. The fund did experience some difficulties in establishing
appropriate procedures but the delay was primarily caused by the failure of the Government to implement
agreed upon policy changes to facilitate exports.
Proect 2
29.          In late 1992, a private sector assistance project in a West African country proposed a
US$8.9 million consultancy fund. This fund would support private enterprises including service firm
and would finance up to 75 percent of the costs of training and consulting assignments. Firms would be
eligible for a maximum of two interventions and a cumulative subsidy of US$60,000.
30.          The fund will be administered by a newly created non-profit professional association of
private business people. The fund would be governed by a board composed of representatives from the
local banks and private sector organizations.

RWANDESE REPUBLIC
PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Action Plan for Bangue Rwandaise de Developpement
1.           A detailed independent special audit of BRD's loan and equity portfolio, was undertaken
in November 1992, by a team of three experienced, professional consultant bankers hired by IDA, with
financing from a Japanese grant. This audit, covered 85 percent of the portfolio outstanding, which was
thus classified into five categories according to increasing risks of losses and degree of interest earning
performance and capacity. The current 1991 audit, as well as previous audit reports of BRD's financial
statements did not go into such details and coverage, and are therefore less reliable sources to measure
realistically BRD's portfolio performance for the purpose of the static analysis below. The conclusions
of this special loan and equity portfolio audit is that, as of end 1992, BRD's loan and equity portfolio is
under-provisioned by RwF370 million (US$2.8 million).
2.           On the basis of the foregoing portfolio analysis, and an estimation of the performing
loans, defined stricto-sensu to exclude all non-performing loans and those expected to become fully non-
performing. A zero-based budgeting exercise was also undertaken by the consultants to determine and
forecast (a) the interest earning capacity, ceteris-paribus, of BRD; and (b) the ensuing sustainable, and
downsized, operating capacity and structure to generate profits while managing the reduced, but
performing loan portfolio amounting to RwF2,089 million (US$15 million, equivalent to 62.5 percent
of the gross loan portfolio outstanding). In this regard the consultants undertook a detailed evaluation
and appraisal of BRD's operational, lending, and financial capacities, including a review and analysis of
its cost of intermediation, and margins of profits, organizational structure and procedures, staffing and
lending policies and strategies. The conclusions and recommendations of the study were reviewed by
BRD and agreed during negotiations for implementation as a condition of eligibility of BRD under the
line of credit component of the project. The consultants' recommendations, which are detailed and
numerous, include, inter alia, the following actions grouped into three major headings:
A.    Human Resources
(i)    Restructuring and downsizing of the operational and managerial organization to
reduce costs, increase accountability, and improve efficiency. Priorities include
(a) reinforcing the Litigation and Legal division; (b) strengthening of the
Inspection department; and (c) adopting a monitoring system for new operating
budgets, treasury operations, and so on.
(ii)   Evaluation of jobs, staff competencies and aptitudes for retraining and
reassignment; reclassification and decrease of the number of staff by 41, from the
current 107 to 66, thus generating savings of RwF35 million a year.
(iii)  Immediate closing of BRD's three banking branches in Butare, Giseny and
Gikongoro, and reassignment of their 10 professional staff to headquarters (these
branches having treated less than 15 loans, and generating heavy overhead costs
with no profits).



- 135 -                                     Annex 14
Page 2 of 2
(iv)   Preparation of a Staff Reconversion Plan for the 41 persons expected to be
reclassified as redundant.
B.    Risk Management and Provisions
(v)    Revision of lending criteria, limits and procedures.
(vi)   Reinforcement of the legal division and of loan administration and supervision.
(vii)  Revision of loan classification by risk categories and of provisions policies;
implementation of the recommended RwF370 million, in addition provisions over
3 years.
(viii)  Ensuring a minimum bank intermediation margin of 7 percent, and maintaining
for at least 5 years, the income tax exemption regime already granted by the
Government to the BRD in order to allow the institution to provision adequately
its riskcs, and remunerate its capital; the current 6.5 percent intermediation
margin does not allow for such a policy.
C.    Budgeting Control and Programming
(ix)   Development of new programming, budgeting and budget monitoring systems
and procedures.
(x)    Preparation of a 3-year Budget, showing the financial impact at the various
measures of the Action Plan.
(xi)   Preparing terms of reference and work program for a computerization master
plan with a view to creating a universal system based on a more systematic
'client-indexing' rather than on an 'operation-indexing' software; such client
based bank software are more flexible and have a wider coverage of accounting
operations that are necessary, in commercial banking activities in particular.
This would ease BRD's possible future transition from pure investment lending
to a full service commercial banking institution.
