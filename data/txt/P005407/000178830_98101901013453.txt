I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Background
1.01     Morocco suffers from a drastic imbalance between domestic production
and consumption of both commercial and traditional forms of energy. On the
commercial side, in 1981, primary production amounted to about 0.69 million
TOE (from coal (51%), hydropower (37%), natural gas (9%), and oil (3%)). This
compared with total domestic demand for commercial energy of about 4.75
million TOE. As in the past, the deficit was made up almost entirely by oil
imports, which constituted about 85% of supply and absorbed about 49% of
Morocco's export earnings.

1.02     Demand for traditional energy (fuelwood, charcoal, agricultural
residues, etc.) amounted to about 2.60 million TOE in 1981, or about 35% of
Morocco's overall demand for commercial and traditional energy. To satisfy
this demand, the rate at which wood is extracted from the country's forests
currently exceeds the rate of natural growth by a factor of about three.
1.03     The rising oil bill which exceeded $1.0 billion in 1981 has been a
major reason for a marked deterioration in Morocco's overall economic
performance in the past several years. The Government is attempting to curb
the growth of energy demand through price increases and an active campaign to
induce energy savings. In an effort to expedite development of domestic
energy supplies, it has also begun to implement a number of important
investments in petroleum exploration, expansion of hydroelectric power
generation capacity, the development of the oil shale deposits, and
reforestation.
1.04     In view of the limits on available coal and hydro resources and the
lead time required for oil shale development, a successful petroleum
investment program would provide the best prospect in the near term for
augmenting indigenous supplies. One potentially significant step in this



-2-
direction, undertaken under the current Bank loan for petroleum exploration
(Loan S-18-MOR), has already been achieved through the discovery of gas and
liquid condensates in Meskala in the Essaouira Basin. The Government is now
aware that its present plans in the energy sector would need to be
significantly altered if the discovery proves to be economically
exploitable. The assessment of Meskala's hydrocarbon potential is therefore a
priority objective of its energy investment program, and is the single most
promising option for alleviating Morocco's dependence on imported energy in
the 1980's.
Energy Resources
1.05     Coal.  At present, Morocco's main domestic commercial energy sources
are coal and hydropower. Its coal potential appears, however, limited to the
Jerada anthracite deposit which is presently being exploited. The Jerada
basin is estimated to contain between 8-40 million TOE of coal reserves. No
other mineable coal deposits have been identified, although traces of coal
have been found in four different basins (Tindouf, the Hauts Plateaux, Er
Rachidia, and Fquih Ben Sahal). The Jerada mine entered production in 1938
and currently produces about 800,000 Tpy (or 350,000 TOE/yr). The mine is,
however, difficult to exploit because of its highly fragmented geological
structure and very thin, steeply inclined and deep seams. Given this geology
of the coal deposits, production from the Jerada area is unlikely to exceed
0.6-1.2 million TOE per year.
1.06     Hydropower and Electricity.  Morocco's total hydro potential is
estimated at about 4,600 GWh (1.1 million TOE) per year. About a third of the
total hydro capacity is already developed, and current plans call for
developing 85% of total potential by the early 1990s. Rainfall is both highly
seasonal and variable from year to year. Many small hydro sites exist, but
even cumulatively they are only a minor resource.
1.07     The major elements-of the power system include oil-fired power plants
at Mohammedia, Kenitra, and Casablanca, a mine-mouth coal-fired plant at
Jerada, a number of hydro plants, and a transmission grid linking all the
major generating and consuming centers from Agadir to Tangier and Oujda. In
1981, installed capacity totalled about 1,840 MW of which 66% was thermal and
34% hydro. The capacities and 1981 operation of the principal power stations
are shown in Annex 1.1.
1.08     Hydrocarbons.  Prior to 1958, exploration for hydrocarbons was
confined principally to the shallow depth horizons of the Gharb basin in
northwest Morocco and resulted in discovery of several small oil fields. Sidi
Rhalem, another small oil field, was discovered in the Essaouira Basin in
southwest Morocco in 1961. Whereas in the past, oil production from these
fields made small but significant contributions to energy supplies, the Gharb
fields are almost depleted now and domestic oil production is continuing to
decline. Annual production, which peaked at about 2,900 BD in 1963, has
declined to about 350 BD (19,000 TOE/yr) by 1981. Exploration activity in the
Gharb and Essaouira basins also led, prior to the 1980's, to the discovery of
several small gas fields (paras. 2.08 and 2.10). An average of 3 BCF
(60,000 TOE) per year of gas has been produced from 1975 through 1981, with
production almost equally divided between the Gharb and Essaouira Basins.



- 3 -
1.09     In 1981, gas was discovered in deeper pre-Jurassic horizons at
Meskala in the Essaouira Basin. The gas is of good quality and is rich in
liquid condensates. The current and proposed exploration projects aim at
assessing the recoverable reserves and production potential of this discovery
and adjacent areas.
1.10     Oil Shale.  Moroccan oil shale reserves identified to date are
estimated at well above 100 billion tons, containing more than 6 billion tons
of oil. The two major deposits are located at Timahdit in the central plateau
about 90 kms south of Fes, and at Sebkat-Tazgha near Tarfaya. A third deposit
is near Tangier and the Strait of Gibraltar. The most favorable deposit for
early development of an oil shale industry appears to be Timahdit, where
proven reserves of about 3.3 billion tons of oil shale have been identified
with an average oil content of 65 liters/ton of shale. An extensive program
to assess the technical and economic viability of a commercial exploitation of
the Timahdit deposit for producing oil is presently being undertaken with the
assistance of. the Bank (Loan 2114-MOR), as well as of foreign petroleum
companies who might be interested in participating in an oil shale project in
that location.
1.11     Nuclear Fuel.  Morocco's large phosphate reserves (about 50 billion
tons) contain some 7 to 10 million tons or 60 to 84 billion TOE of uranium.
Extraction does not, however, appear economic with present technology. The
Government is exploring the possibilities of using the extract for fueling
nuclear plants to be operational in the 1990's. No conventional deposits of
uranium are known.
1.12     Biomass.  Moroccan natural forests cover about 5.1 million ha and an
additional 2.6 million ha are covered by esparto grass; of this area, only
about 2.5 million ha of forests and 1.0 million ha of esparto grass areas have
significant production potential. The maximum sustainable rate of fuelwood
extraction has been estimated at about 750,000 TOE per year, or less than 30%
of the estimated actual rat-e. Agricultural residues appear to be a much
larger (but also much less easily collected and used) resource. A very rough
estimate puts potential production at, at least, 3.0 (and possibly as much as
9.0) million TOE/yr. It is also estimated that organic solid wastes and
sewerage wastes can together provide about 360,000 TOE/yr.
1.13     Wind and Solar.  Morocco is endowed with an unusually good wind
regime technically well suited for both pumping water and generating
electricity. The country is also favorably situated for the development of
solar energy, with high average solar radiation of about 0.16 TOE/m2-year in
the north and about 0.18 TOE/m2-year in the south. Both solar and wind
resources are consequently promising sources of energy for small scale uses,
but neither is likely to-contribute significantly to national energy balances.
Energy Consumption
1.14     International Comparisons.  Overall, the energy intensity of
Morocco's economy is lower than those of most developing countries with
similar economic structures. Commercial energy consumption in 1980 of 238 TOE
per million US$ of GNP compares with 334 for Tunisia, 376 for Turkey, and 447
for Bolivia. Consumption of about 0.28 TOE/capita is in the lower end of the
range spanned by these countries, of 0.78 (for Bolivia) and 0.25 (for
Tunisia).

1.15     Current Consumption.  A summary of energy consumption by sector and
energy form is shown in the table below:

Total           53       40         1,171      2,052    927   2,979        4,243
Note:  "Industry" includes mining and "Services" include government and commerce.
CLF (clean liquid fuels) include LPG, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, and
gasoil). FO is fuel oil.
1.16     In 1981, industry accounted for about 42% of final demand for
commercial energy. Of total industrial consumption of nearly 1.8 million TOE,
about 21% was attributable to the phosphate and 24% to the cement
industries. The transportation and services sector accounted for an almost
equal share (or 39%) of commercial energy demand. Overall, households are the
most important energy consuming sector; household consumption is, however,
primarily reliant on traditional energy sources and constitutes no more than
15% of commercial energy demand.
1.17     Electricity and gas oil together account for over half of final
demand for commercial energy, with 28% and 26% of the total respectively. The
remainder is made up of fuel oil (about 22%), gasoline (8.5%), followed by LPG
(7%), jet fuel (5%), coal (1.3%), kerosene (1.2%) and natural gas (1.0%).
Morocco is unusual among developing countries in that the imbalance between
the product slate of its refineries and the proportions in which oil products
are consumed gives it a surplus of the higher value light products and/or a
deficit on the lower value heavy products. Oil product exports are thus
primarily naphtha, while product imports are mostly fuel oil. Substantial
quantities of LPG are also imported.
1.18     Past and Future Trends.  Over the 1965 to 1980 period, Morocco's
commercial energy demand grew at about 7.4% p.a. on average. This compares
with an average annual GDP growth rate of about 5%. The overall growth rate
actually slowed somewhat through the period, so that by 1975-80 energy demand
growth (of 6.5% p.a. on average) was within 1% p.a. of the (5.6% average
annual) GDP-growth rate. There was also some shifting of market shares among
the three broad groups of commercial energy commodities; electricity; clean
liquid fuels (CLF) and boiler fuels, 1/ as indicated in the table below.
1/ Boiler fuels include coal, natural gas and fuel oil - for CLF see footnote
in table above.



1.19     Overall, demand for commercial energy is expected to grow from
4.7 million TOE in 1980 to between 8.6 million TOE and 13.1 million TOE in
1995 1/ 1J. As also indicated in the table, projections for the period 1980-
1995 imply a continued shift toward electricity from 26% of total consumption
in 1980, to 40% in 1995.

Energy Supply
1.20     Past Pattern and Potential Future Options.  The growth in energy
consumption over the 1965-80 period was coupled to a pattern of energy
supplies characterized chiefly by three main trends: (i) a declining share of
hydropower (from 87% of total electricity supply in 1965 to 29% in 1980);
(ii) a parallel decline in the share of coal (from about 28% of total boiler
fuel supply in 1965 to 17% in 1980); and (iii) a marked shift in favor of oil
products, the share of which in total commercial demand rose from about 71% in
1965 to about 85% in 1980, with the major proportion of this increase being
accounted for by an increase in supply of fuel oil. In 1970, total demand for
fuel oil (direct plus indirect via thermal power plants) represented 33% of
the oil market, a fraction which rose to 45% in 1980. Meanwhile, the share of
fuel oil in refinery production (excluding non-energy products) rose from 30%
in 1970 to 44% in 1980.
1.21     If the present dependence on oil continues, crude oil imports could
rise from 4.4 million TOE in 1980 to as much as 11.3 million TOE in 1995,
entailing an increase in the oil import bill from about $0.9 billion in 1980
to nearly $3.5 billion in 1995 (in 1981$) (see Annex 1.2). On the demand
side, the large proportion of Morocco's energy consumption that is now
accounted for by fuel oil directly or indirectly offers a variety of
opportunities for inter-fuel substitution and conservation; and on the supply
1/  Real GDP growth is projected at 3.1% p.a. on average in the 1980-85 period
and 5.0% p.a. thereafter. Overall demand for commercial energy is
projected to grow at the same rate (low forecast) or at 3% p.a. higher
(high forecast).
2/  Consumption of traditional fuels is projected to decline very slowly (from
2.59 million TOE in 1985 to 2.46 million TOE in 1995) as consumers switch
to commercial fuels (primarily LPG) at a rate that compensates for
population growth.

side, imported coal, natural gas and condensates from the Essaouira area, and
oil shale could be available to displace imported oil on a large scale.
1.22     Imported Coal.  New thermal power stations and the cement and
phosphate industries would represent the most likely major markets for coal.
Together they are projected to provide (in the case of high demand and no gas
supplies) a potential coal market of about 1.6 million TOE in 1990 and
4.0 million TOE in 1995. At this level of demand, switching to coal could
hold the oil import bill to less than 1981$1.8 billion in 1990. Holding
demand growth at the same time to lower levels would reduce the import bill
for that year to 1981$1.4 billion (Annex 1.2).
1.23     Natural Gas.  Natural gas and condensates from Essaouira represent
the most immediately promising source for alleviating the need for imports of
either oil or coal. At present, 37% of the small quantities of natural gas
produced annually (para. 1.08) is consumed in refining, 47% in the phosphate,
and 16% in the pulp and paper industries. However, 'new' natural gas, if it
were to be available in sufficient quantities, could supply nearly 60% of the
total direct demand for boiler fuels and between 47% and 75% of demand in
electricity generation. Depending on the growth rate of overall commercial
energy demand, the projected market for gas would total between 1.9 and 2.9
million TOE in 1990 and between 3.0 and 5.4 million TOE in 1995 (see also
Annex 1.3). A preliminary market study is on-going under the current
petroleum exploration project to further assess this gas market and rank
possible uses for both the gas and condensates. It is presently estimated
that if by 1990 gas from Essaouira were available in sufficient quantities to
meet market demand, the import bill would be held to about 1981$1.2 billion.
Holding demand growth to lower levels would reduce the bill for that year to
1981$0.9 billion (Annex 1.2).
1.24     Oil Shale.  Large scale natural gas and condensate production from
Meskala could displace fuel oil in the market for boiler fuels and provide a
source of naphtha for gasoline production other than the distillation of crude
oil as well as substantial quantities of LPG. The middle distillates,
primarily gas oil in the Moroccan context, would however be relatively
unaffected. Shale oil development, on the other hand, would probably have the
opposite effect as shale oil typically yields a high percentage of middle
distillates.
1.25     The shale development, whose feasibility is being studied, would
produce 0.6-1.2 million TOE per year in both oil extracted from shale and the
oil equivalent of electricity generated from direct shale combustion.l/ On
the basis of current estimates, the first commercial plants would not appear
to be economically justifiable 2/. This picture of the economics could,
however, be altered should it turn out that the costs and risks involved can

larger complex producing roughly 3.6 million TOE/year over at least a
25-year period.
2/ Shale oil extraction cost of about $350/TOE, as compared to the projected
price of imported crude oil of $305/TOE in 1995; and electricity costs

be significantly reduced and/or that the oil import price will rise faster
than is presently projected. l/ For this reason, the option of medium-term
oil shale supply should not be prematurely discounted. On the other hand,
neither should a commitment to shale development be made prior to complete
evaluation of the results of the planned feasibility studies.
Energy Conservation and Pricing
1.26     Possible Investments.  Substantial energy and energy cost savings
appear feasible in Moroccan industry through energy conservation and fuel
switching. A preliminary survey of all possible conservation measures has
indicated that, taken together, enterprises in the major industries involved
(cement, textiles, pulp and paper, and sugar) could save nearly 82,000 TOE
annually, or about 5% of the industrial sector's total energy consumption in
1981. These annual savings would be equivalent to about $15.5 million for a
total investment cost of about $40.0 million.2/  Fuel switching of several
(and possibly all) cement plants to coal or gas, should it become available,
is expected also to be highly economic. A program of energy audits and
feasibility studies to identify and evaluate the potential in sufficient
detail to permit investment decisions to be made is presently under
consideration.
1.27     Pricing.  The Government has for several years now been encouraging
energy conservation by maintaining prices of most resources above their
opportunity cost to the economy. Annex 1.4 summarizes the commercial energy
price structure and the relationship between internal prices and comparators
constructed by adding an allowance for internal transportation and
distribution costs to the c.i.f. price of imports. Oil product prices are all
at or above their comparators, with the lower margins applying (for income
distribution purposes) to the household fuels, LPG and kerosene, and the
highest to gasoline. Although imported steam coal is also above its
comparator, the domestic coal price and the average price of electricity
remain at 76% and 69% of their comparator prices respectively. Electricity
tariffs need to be generally increased and their structure rationalized, both
to facilitate the financing of power investments, and to stimulate more
efficient use of electrical energy. This is presently being discussed between
the Bank and the Government within the context of the preparation of the
proposed Dchar el Oued project. Coal pricing will also be addressed through a
future project currently under preparation. The Bank has also recommended to
the Government through the recent UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment (Report
No. 4157-MOR) other structural price incentives to improve productivity and
efficiency in petroleum refining and product distribution and coal
importation.
1.28     At present, the very small quantities of natural gas produced from
Essaouira are sold at about $2.5/MCF or below the cost of the fuel replaced
(about $4.0/MCF). This price, however, is covered by long-term contracts.
The Government has been reviewing the gas pricing issue, with the intention of
setting an appropriate price for all 'new' domestic gas supplies. The

uncertainty as to the volume of future supplies from Meskala complicates the
determination of such a policy, as the utilization options and related
opportunity costs for gas are partly a function of the volume of supply.
Nevertheless, the Moroccan fuel oil market is large, and much of it could be
switched to gas. For the time being, a gas price linked to that of fuel oil
(with enough of a discount to justify conversion and rapid market penetration)
would therefore be appropriate until reserves are found to be sufficiently
large that it appears advantageous to encourage lower value uses. Following
consultations during the course of preparation of this project, the Government
has confirmed to the Bank its intention to set the price for all new gas on
the basis of the cost of alternative energy sources.
Sector Institutions
1.29     Present Organization.  The Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) is
responsible for overall planning and policy making in the sector. It also
supervises several public (or semi-public) enterprises which manage the
sector's key activities; most notably, the Office National de Recherches et
Exploitation Petrolieres (ONAREP) in hydrocarbon and shale exploration and
production; the Societe Anonyme Marocaine de l'Industrie du Raffinage (SAMIR)
and the 50% ONAREP-owned Societe Cherifienne des Petroles (SCP) in refining;
the Societe National des Produits Petrolier (SNPP) in the distribution of
petroleum products; and the Charbonnages du Maroc (Charbonnages), operator of
the Jerada coal mine. It also has administrative control over the Office
National de l'Electricite (ONE), the public enterprise responsible for most of
the electricity generated and transmitted in Morocco. MEM is also involved in
development of renewable energy and has established the Center for Renewable
Energy Development (CDER).
1.30     The Ministry was created at the end of 1977 and has two main
operating directorates--Energy and Mines; the Energy Directorate is organized
into three divisions responsible for dealing with energy supply issues and
institutions: (i) petroleum products (SAMIR, the SCP refinery, SNPP,
distributors); (ii) electricity (ONE); and (iii) energy resource development
(ONAREP, Charbonnages, and CDER).
1.31     Exploration and production of oil and gas form the major part of the
operations of ONAREP whose responsibilities include not only (i) the
exploration for oil and gas either on its own or through joint ventures with
foreign companies, and (ii) the production of fields discovered on its
permits, but also (iii) the prospection and development of oil shale
resources; and (iv) the management of the government portfolio in the SCP
refinery. Of the two refineries in Morocco, one, at the port of Mohammedia
(SAMIR), is 100%-owned by the Government with a refining capacity of 2.2
million tons per annum which is now being increased to 5.7 million tons, and
the other (SCP) is located inland at Sidi Kacem with a 0.8 million ton
capacity. Petroleum product distribution is handled by 27 companies, most of
them owned 51% by SNPP, a state enterprise, and 49% by foreign companies. The
remaining distributors are owned by private Moroccan interests. Separate
public enterprises operate an underground LPG storage facility, ocean shipping
of oil and oil products (three enterprises), and petroleum product storage
terminals.



- 9 -
1.32     In the coal subsector, the Charbonnages is the single coal producing
institution and is also directly in charge of coal exploration and export
marketing. In the power subsector, ONE generates approximately 90% of the
electric power in the country, transmits it to the load centers, and
distributes about 40% of its production outside the large cities.
Distribution of power in large urban areas is the responsibility of Regies
which are autonomous public enterprises under the supervision of the Ministry
of the Interior (MI). At present, the renewable energy unit at MEM is the
main policy formulations body in this subsector. Two other ministries, the
Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MARA) and MI also play a key role
in the subsector through the Directorate of Water, Forests, and Soil
Conservation (DEFS) and the Provincial Governors. Forestry Councils have also
been established since 1976 at national, provincial and local levels.
Sector Investment, Policy and Planning
1.33     The current 1981-85 five year plan calls for a total of energy
related investments of about DH11.65 billion, or about 10% of total public
investments foreseen under the plan. Distribution among subsectors is as
shown in the table below. Of the total, about DH2.00 billion or 17% is for
oil and gas exploration and production. Government budget contributions of
about DH6.54 billion (56% of the total) are expected to finance part or all of
the investment in most categories and none in others (oil refining and product
distribution). Other sources of investment financing in the sector would
include private investors (mostly foreign oil companies), cash generation from
the enterprises, and grants or loans.

Note:  The Meskala discovery was not foreseen in the preparation of the plan
and no specific allowance was included for a possible large-scale
development. However, provision was included for possible
development of small fields in Essaouira and the Gharb and for
continuation and expansion of the exploration program in central
Essaouira (the Meskala area) through end 1985. Other investments in
oil and gas include oil port and tankers, LPG storage, refining and
product distribution. Of the electricity investment, 40% is
allocated to hydro generation, 22% for thermal generation and the



- 10 -
rest for transmission, distribution and other purposes; of the oil
shale allocation, about 51% is for a test station for liquids
extraction, 45% for a direct shale combustion experimental unit and
5% for studies. The modernization of Jerada accounts for 100% of
projected coal investment, and reforestation for about 83% of
investment in renewables.
1.34     Over the coming 5-10 year horizon, the government has three main
policy objectives for the energy sector: (i) promotion of energy import
substitution; (ii) promotion of efficient energy use; and (iii) the increasing
of domestic resource mobilization and budgetary savings through reduction in
subsidies. To this end, in conjunction with an ambititous plan for
investment, the Government is seeking to institute improvements on a number of
institutional and policy fronts of which the most important involve
(i) reinforcement of the process of selection and coordination of energy and
energy-related investments and of the management and organization of public
sector enterprises; and (ii) improvements in the present pricing structures
and in the incentives for attracting further foreign investment. The proposed
loan would address several of these issues, particularly those impacting the
petroleum subsector, and as such forms part of an overall program for Bank
assistance to Morocco in this critical sector.
II. THE PETROLEUM EXPLORATION SECTOR
Introduction
2.01     Exploration for oil and gas has been conducted in Morocco since
1928. The only active company prior to independence in 1956 was the French
company, Societe Cherifienne des Petroles (SCP). Following independence, a
petroleum code was enacted which provided for both State agency and foreign
oil company participation in exploration and subsequent development
activities. Although the provisions of this code are quite attractive
relative to current industry standards, the level of foreign investment varied
widely over the past two decades. The Government reacted both by increasing
the exploration program of its own State agency and by making special efforts
at attracting further foreign oil company interest through formal
presentations and discussions with foreign oil firms. Past efforts are now
being renewed with the launching of a new promotional program undertaken by
ONAREP with the assistance of industry consultants financed under the current
Bank exploration loan.
2.02     The discovery of Meskala by the national oil company has coincided
with renewed interest in exploration by foreign companies, principally
directed towards Morocco's offshore. At the same time, in view of its
importance to Morocco, the rapid assessment of Meskala has become the
principal focus of ONAREP's own investment plans for the coming two years.
Petroleum Geology and Prospectiveness
2.03     Onshore and offshore Morocco span about a dozen sedimentary basins
which could contain oil and gas. These cover an area of about 150,000 km2,
about two thirds onshore. Commercially producible discoveries have been found
in two onshore basins, the Gharb and Essaouira, and good shows have been



- 11 -
encountered in two others, Tarfaya (offshore) and Doukkala (onshore).
Potential source rocks, which may have generated oil or natural gas, cover a
large part of the sedimentary basins and include Miocene shales, Jurassic
limestones and shales, and Paleozoic shales. Structures capable of trapping
the generated hydrocarbons are also numerous and involve: compressional folds;
plastic flow of widespread Triassic salt deposits; and pre-Triassic block
faulting. Seals needed for the retention of hydrocarbons in traps are also
widespread and include compact shales, dense limestones and evaporites
(including, in particular, Triassic salt). The one criteria for successful
exploration not yet found to be widespread is the presence of high quality
porous reservoir rocks. Success in future exploration hinges, therefore, on
identifying and drilling those structures where improved reservoirs may be
reasonably predicted, and/or on extending the search in areas already
containing oil and gas discoveries in the direction of predicted reservoir
improvement.
2.04     Proved plus probable remaining reserves are quite small, of the order
of approximately 65 BCF of natural gas (40 BCF developed in four fields and 25
BCF undeveloped in six fields), 1 MM Bbl of gas liquids (all undeveloped) and
1 MM Bbl of oil (developed in two fields). Current production is about 350 BD
oil and 8.2 MMCFD gas.
2.05     Although not yet assessed, the recent Meskala gas/condensate
discovery from presalt Triassic sandstone in the Essaouira Basin offers the
prospect for additions to the proved plus probable reserves, on a scale quite
large in comparison to previous discoveries in Morocco. Based on current
information, the best prospects for additional discoveries of gas are in the
Essaouira, the Gharb, Boudnib, and the Hauts Plateaux Basins onshore and in
the offshore Mediterranean. The best prospects for new discoveries of oil are
in the offshore Tarfaya, Agadir and Essaouira Basins, and the onshore Doukkala
Basin. The geology of Morocco is described in further detail in Annex 2.1.
(See. also IBRD Map 16879R1).
Petroleum Legislation and Policy
2.06     Under the 1958 Petroleum Code, private investors are encouraged to
explore in Morocco. Exclusive exploration rights on parcels selected by the
oil company (size negotiable) are granted for three successive four-year
periods based on submission of a satisfactory work program for each period.
In the case of a commercial discovery, a 30-50 year development license is
awarded. Preference is given to those investors who offer the State agency
participation in the exploration/development venture. Under such joint-
venture agreements, foreign partners are liable for all exploration
expenditures, their proportionate shares of development and production costs,
royalties (12.5% for oil and 5% for gas), and taxes on net income of 55%.
Costs, including related exploration expenses, are expensed or amortized at
rates varying from between 10% and 20% per annum. Investors are accorded an
additional incentive in the form of a 27.5% depletion allowance. These terms
are quite attractive relative to current industry standards. A revision of
the 1958 Petroleum Code is now under consideration. The new code, which is
expected to be in force by mid-1983, will continue to emphasize investment
incentives.



- 12 -
2.07     Only one group, led by Petrofina (Apex), has applied for and received
a development license in a joint-venture with ONAREP for two small gas fields
in the Gharb Basin. ONAREP and SCP 1/ have also been awarded development
contracts for three fields, two gas and one oil, in the Essaouira Basin. The
remaining discoveries which may be developed are in areas controlled by ONAREP
and plans for their development are currently under study (para. 2.14).
Past Exploration Activity
2.08     Prior to Independence in 1956, all exploration was conducted by
SCP. Most of the exploration during this period took place in the Gharb Basin
where a substantial number of wells were drilled and several small oil fields
were discovered at shallow depths. All fields discovered during this period
are now essentially depleted. After Independence, under the then new
Petroleum Code, exploration extended to other areas, first onshore and then
offshore, mostly through joint-venture agreements between ONAREP's predecessor
agency, the Bureau de Recherches et de Participations Minieres (BRPM) and
foreign investors (para. 5.01). The first onshore exploration permit was
awarded in 1958 in joint-venture with Agip in the Tarfaya region. The first
offshore permit was awarded in joint-venture with Esso in 1967 in the offshore
Tarfaya Basin. A number of other permits, both onshore and offshore,
followed. Between 1958 and 1972, over 80 exploration wells were drilled
onshore and ten were drilled offshore. The onshore wells averaged 1,750 m in
depth and the offshore wells averaged about 3,300 m. During this same period,
the exploration activities of the Moroccan state agency remained modest,
principally involving joint-venture work with Apex and SCP in the exploration
of the Gharb and Essaouira Basins respectively. The fields currently
producing in these two areas were discovered during this time.
2.09     The early 1970s (immediately post-1972) were a turning point in the
history of exploration in Morocco as the foreign companies active offshore
began to pull out due to disappointing results. The biggest setback came when
Esso relinquished its large offshore Tarfaya permit even though it had
discovered a sizeable in-place reserve and had tested oil at the rate of 2,700
BD in its MO-2 well. However, the oil was viscous (with a low API gravity)
and in the absence of any appreciable matrix porosity Esso judged, probably
correctly, that the reservoir was highly fractured and had a strong water
drive. Therefore, severe water coning problems could have been anticipated
resulting in a very low recovery of oil in-place, and the discovery was
declared noncommercial and the permit relinquished. Poor reservoir quality,
alluded to previously, was the principal reason for this action.
2.10     Between 1973 and 1978, as foreign investors continued to leave, the
burden of exploration for petroleum in Morocco reverted to BRPM. BRPM was in
a period of expanding its organization and building its capability by
acquiring seismic and drilling equipment, and made during the period, two
small discoveries in the onshore Essaouira Basin (Toukimt and N'Dark).
Encouraged by this success, BRPM proposed, in 1978, an ambitious program
designed to increase its exploration expenditures three-fold (from US$17
million per year to US$50 million per year). At the same time, a vigorous
1/ Which has, since Independence, been 50%-owned by Morocco.



- 13 -
effort was made to re-attract foreign companies (of which two responded
acquiring two onshore permit areas and one offshore). Just, however, as
BRPM's expanded exploration program was getting underway, economic problems
led the Government to curtail BRPM funds for petroleum exploration, reducing
allocations to about US$15 million per year. At this point, BRPM had a number
of prospects ready to drill similar to those on which the earlier discoveries
had been made in the Essaouira Basin plus several deep gas prospects (in the
Meskala area) in the same basin which had been indicated through prior
drilling but which had not yet been fully evaluated. It was also learned at
about this time that shallow gas reservoirs in the Gharb Basin could be
identified on the seismic records by analysis of amplitude anomalies ("bright
spots") as a result of work done by foreign companies still active in the area
(for further details on exploration history see Annex 2.1).
2.11     In order to follow-up on these prospects and to prevent the loss of
the exploration momentum that had begun, BRPM approached the Bank for a
petroleum exploration loan. A Bank loan of US$50 million was approved on
May 19, 1980 (Loan S-18-MOR). The principal provisions of this loan were
allocated to the drilling of exploratory wells, and the carrying out of
seismic surveys and geologic studies aimed at elaborating a strategy for
future onshore exploration and attracting foreign investors. Since the loan
was made the Bank has financed ONAREP's drilling of eight exploratory wells
and two appraisal wells, seven in the Essaouira Basin and three in the Gharb
Basin.  Three discoveries were made, two in the Gharb and one in Essaouira.
Of these, the Meskala-101 Triassic discovery in Essaouira is the only one
likely to be commercial.  The discovery established a new productive zone for
Morocco in a good location and, as detailed in Annex 2.1, the gas is of good
quality and rich in liquid condensates, and the possibility exists that the
gas accumulation may extend over a large regional area. In view of the
jointly assessed promise of the discovery, the Bank and ONAREP reached
agreement immediately following the testing of the discovery well to allocate
all remaining drilling funds under Loan S-18-MOR to the drilling of four
additional wells, all deep gas tests in Essaouira (three to appraise the
discovery and one to explore adjacent areas). In addition, a reservoir
engineering study by CORE Laboratories Inc. (USA), which has just commenced
under Loan S-18-MOR, will initiate assessment of the Meskala reserves and
production potential. The proposed project would have, as one of its
principal objectives to complete the exploration and appraisal of this area
(para. 3.12).
2.12     The gas/condensate discovery in Meskala in 1981 has coincided with a
renewal of interest of foreign companies in Morocco's prospects. The
interest, however, is so far mainly directed towards the offshore. ONAREP has
signed three new exploration joint-venture agreements with foreign partners
since the fall of 1981. These agreements with Arco (September 1981), Mobil
(February 1982) and Amoco (June 1982), cover a 4,450 km2 offshore Agadir
block, two blocks of 9,710 km2 offshore Tarfaya and two blocks of 9,835 km2
offshore the Mediterranean, respectively (see Map IBRD 16879R1). They commit
the foreign partners (who will bear 100% of exploration cost) to exploration
expenditures in the first four-year period, of $18.0 million (seismic plus two
wells) in the case of Arco, $37.5 million (seismic plus 3 wells) in the case
of Mobil, and $22.0 million (seismic plus 2 wells) in the case of Amoco.
Negotiations are also underway with the Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Corporation
(KFPC), which appears to be the only company giving serious consideration at



- 14 -
this time to several onshore blocks (Boudnib, Doukkala and the Essaouira
extensions). The two foreign companies (Elf and Phillips) who signed
contracts in 1978 (para. 2.10) have since relinquished their permits.
However, work on small fields in the Gharb by Apex, and in Essaouira by SCP,
continues. During 1981, nine foreign companies, in addition to those
negotiating contracts visited ONAREP inquiring about potential exploration
licenses and this pace of inquiries is currently being maintained. With a
view to reinforcement of these discussions, ONAREP has recently signed a
contract (funded under the current Bank loan) with Gaffney Cline and
Associates Ltd (UK) for a first phase promotional program including collation,
interpretation and presentation in about mid-1983 of five priority areas to
the industry both in Morocco and abroad (Ifni Offshore, Essaouira Offshore,
Souss Onshore, the Hauts Plateaux and Tadla, see IBRD Map 16879R1). A second
phase promotional program would be undertaken under the proposed loan
(para. 3.12-3.13).
2.13     While ONAREP did not formally advertise the Meskala area to the oil
industry, the area has been shown to all the companies that have visited
enquiring about possibilities to invest in Morocco. Only one company, KFPC,
made a proposal; but they were only willing to commit to a small and extended
program (approximately two wells over a two-year period). Other companies
that may have considered participation would most likely have taken a similar
position since the area is gas prone and any future gas production is likely
to be directed, at least initially, to the domestic market. Without a clear
prospect of an export potential, the discovery is unlikely to generate much
foreign interest, particularly at a time when the international oil industry
is curtailing its commitments to new exploration activity. On the other hand,
foreign companies may become interested if further drilling establishes both
commercial production and indicates substantial potential for a large
development, including export capability; and both ONAREP and the Government
will be better placed following the assessment of the discovery, to decide on
the utility of foreign participation. For the present, therefore, to expedite
assessment of Meskala and to appraise the overall potential of the area,
ONAREP will need to provide the investment in the project area on its own. In
parallel with this effort, exploratory commitments by foreign operators will
also be increasing (as indicated in the table below), and may be further
enhanced by a successful promotion program financed under the current loan.
This should effectively reduce the requirements on ONAREP for exploration
elsewhere in Morocco, and permit it to concentrate its investment program on
the rapid appraisal of Meskala.

Current Petroleum Exploration Investment Strategy
2.14     ONAREP plans encompass all possible options currently available to
Morocco in its efforts to accelerate exploration and development of petroleum
resources. These are: (a) to reinforce the continuing open-door policy with
respect to foreign companies through activities aimed directly at exploration
promotion; (b) to develop past discoveries (the Toukimt gas/condensate field
in the Essaouira Basin and possibly the OKT gas field in the Gharb Basin); (c)
to expedite full evaluation through seismic and drilling of the reserve and
producing potential of the recent Meskala discovery; (d) to conduct
predrilling exploration (geologic studies and geophysics) in most prospective
remaining basins in order to promote foreign industry investment, or in the
absence of interest, selectively drill on its own; and (e) in conjunction with
SCP and Apex to study currently producing fields to determine what, if any,
additional production capability may be added by either drilling new wells or
by remedial work on existing wells. While all of these options are being
pursued, the major focus at present is on the Meskala appraisal drilling. The
proposed Bank loan will provide ONAREP with substantial assistance both its
efforts at Meskala and for its programs for promotion of Morocco's onshore and
offshore.
The Role of the Bank in the Petroleum Subsector
2.15     The proposed loan would be the second loan made to Morocco for
petroleum exploration, and would constitute part of a coordinated Bank effort
to assist the country in the energy sector. The Bank has already made several
power loans to Morocco aimed at the development of the country's hydroelectric
potential and rural electrification, and a new loan for this purpose is
presently under consideration. A loan to support assessment of the technical
and economic viability of alternative options for oil shale development was
made in 1982. A UNDP/Bank Morocco energy sector assessment and a Bank power
sector study have also recently been completed.



- 16 -
2.16     In the absence of viable alternatives for substantially increasing
domestic energy supply before the 1990's, the acceleration of petroleum
exploration and development remains a high Government priority. In light of
this, the Bank's lending strategy in the petroleum sector is aimed principally
at assisting Morocco to pursue the two principal strategic options available
to it in expediting exploration and development of domestic oil and gas:
(i) the rapid assessment of discovered resources by following up on the
encouraging results achieved at Meskala under the current exploration project;
and (ii) the active encouragement of new investment in exploration by foreign
parties.
2.17     The proposed project constitutes a major proportion of total public
investment in exploration and production for the coming two years. By its
presence, the Bank aims also at helping ONAREP undertake a more efficient
exploration program by improving project design and ensuring adequate
implementation arrangements. The Bank has already played a key role, during
preparation of the project, in helping ONAREP to define a least cost strategy
for appraisal of Meskala and exploration of adjacent Essaouira areas, and to
assess the external technical assistance requirements for sound management and
supervision of drilling operations in difficult high pressure gas
formations. As was the case for the first exploration project
(Loan S-18-MOR), the proposed loan would be a vehicle for the transfer through
technical assistance of the most up-to-date oil industry technology and
management skills. It would also assist in the implementation of a medium-
term plan for ONAREP aimed at strengthening its technical, managerial, and
financial capabilities so as to enable the company to better fulfill its
mandate in the petroleum sector.
2.18     A successful Essaouira exploration/appraisal program, supported under
the first exploration project and the proposed loan, would provide the basis
for major policy decisions on the development of the Meskala discovery and the
elaboration of a strategy for optimization of future natural gas use. These
would include: (i) formulation of a field development strategy; (ii) review
the need for, and relative merits of, seeking technical and financial support
from foreign contractors or foreign company participants; (iii) agreement on
the end uses of gas and natural gas prices; and (iv) formulation of a strategy
for dealing with the implications of a gas development on investment in oil
refining and possible future energy-intensive chemical and mineral projects.
The proposed loan includes several studies aimed directly at addressing these
policy issues, and could be a prelude, in the event of success in the drilling
program, to a continued Bank role in helping Morocco to implement the desired
major changes in the pattern of its energy supplies.
III. THE PROJECT
Background
3.01     In May 1980 the Bank approved a loan (Loan S-18-MOR) of $50 million
to the Bureau de Recherches et Participations Minieres (BRPM) for the purpose
of: (a) continuing the petroleum exploration program in several geological
basins, (b) rehabilitation and subsequent maintenance of BRPM's seismic and
drilling equipment; and (c) technical assistance to BRPM for its petroleum and
oil shale activities.



- 17 -
3.02     The principal result of the current project was the discovery of
natural gas at Meskala in the Essaouira Basin. The discovery well,
Meskala-101 (MKL-101), situated some 30 kilometers east of the city of
Essaouira, was completed in December 1981. Its maximum open flow potential
approximates 20 million cubic feet of gas per day. However, its most
efficient rate (MER) is approximately 6 MMCFD of gas and 510 BD of condensates
with a well head flowing pressure of some 4,800 psi. Another appraisal well
Meskala-102 (MKL-102) was also drilled and tested at a significantly lower
rate than the discovery well (1.4 MMCFD of gas and 100 BD condensate with a
surface flowing pressure of 3,100 psi). Three additional wells are currently
drilling, two of which are in close proximity to the Meskala discovery
(MKL-103 and MKL-104) and the third an exploratory well (OTA-3) located 20
kilometers from MKL-101. (See IBRD Map 16880R).
3.03     The project is now in the last stage of execution and should be
completed by end July 1983. Project activities will, by that time, have
encompassed 13 wells (10 completed and 3 ongoing) and about 55 crew months of
seismic effort covering about 5,000 kms of line (para. 2.11). The Borrower's
drilling and seismic equipment has already been upgraded; and the loan
continues to provide technical assistance to ONAREP through consultants'
services for exploration and drilling, and for exploration promotion,
reservoir engineering, market and institutional studies (paras. 1.23, 2.11,
2.12 and 5.19). The initial oil shale prefeasibility studies have been
completed, and the oil shale studies are continuing with Bank support under
Loan 2114-MOR.
3.04     Past progress in the execution of the current project was adversely
affected by three principal factors: (a) difficult drilling conditions in the
Essaouira Basin and delays by BRPM in contracting technical assistance; (b) an
inability to pre-finance through budgetary funds all purchases of materials
and payments to contractors; and (c) the lengthy procedures entailed in
concluding arrangements for the splitting of the mineral and petroleum assets
of the BRPM and establishment of ONAREP. However, since ONAREP's institution
in 1981, a major effort has been made by both ONAREP and the Government to
resolve these difficulties. ONAREP has actively sought and obtained technical
assistance under the current loan, and the scope of this assistance is being
significantly increased in early 1983, in preparation for the expanded
activities which will follow completion of this first project. At the same
time, ONAREP's investments have been accorded priority by the Government, and
disbursement procedures under the current loan have been changed to allow
maximal use of loan funds for direct payments to suppliers and service
contractors. Basic arrangements for the splitting of BRPM's assets have also
more recently been concluded, and the transfer of the current loan to ONAREP
has become effective on February 25, 1983. Disbursement of loan funds which
had been slow through 1980 and 1981, proceeded at a satisfactory pace
throughout-1982 with the changeover to direct payments procedures. Cumulative
disbursement is expected to total $42.0 million by end-March 1983. The
remaining loan funds of $8.0 million are fully allocated (principally to well
and geophysical services, technical assistance and studies), and the loan is
expected to be almost fully disbursed by end-September 1983.
3.05     While the Meskala gas discovery is potentially significant, it is
extremely difficult, at this stage, to evaluate the size and extent of the
resources associated with this discovery. To do this it is necessary to



- 18 -
continue further geophysical surveys and drilling before a full evaluation of
the discovery can be made. Given the potential importance of this discovery
to Morocco, both the Government and the Bank agree that ONAREP should continue
its operation in the Meskala area at least until the gas find is fully
evaluated, following which other financing/joint venture options could be
explored. In June 1982 a Bank pre-appraisal mission visited Morocco, during
the course of which the scope and content of the proposed project were
formulated. Project appraisal was completed in November 1982.
Gas Potential in the Meskala Area
3.06     There are strong indications that the gas generating source rock
extends over a large area in Essaouira; and thus, the presence and quality of
gas bearing reservoirs are expected to be the key parameters governing the
presence of commercially exploitable reserves at Meskala. The evidence of a
large gas prone area is provided by three deep wells (MKL-1,TK-201 and OTA-2),
drilled between 1975 and 1978 on the top and on the flank of a high regional
fault block (the greater Meskala horst block). All the wells had gas shows
but were prematurely abandoned or improperly tested due to mechanical
difficulties or inability to control the high formation pressure. The linear
distance between these wells is 25 kilometers. A re-interpretation of the
electric logs of MKL-1 shows that this well should have been productive with
an indicated pay zone thicker than penetrated in the discovery well MKL-101.
Furthermore, it is believed that the underlying Paleozoic age rocks could
contribute to gas reserves in the area if an adequate reservoir were to be
encountered in these formations (which has not occurred so far).
(See Annex 2.1 for a complete discussion).
3.07     While there is convincing evidence for the presence of gas in the
Meskala area, there are a number of less encouraging features and
uncertainties which will have a bearing on the overall size and commerciality
of the discovery. The Meskala reservoir characteristics are poor and the
geological and geophysical knowledge of the structural configuration and the
extent of the gas accumulation is still quite limited at present. The gas is
contained beneath a Triassic salt layer of about 300 feet thick (which hampers
obtaining good quality geophysical reflections). The gas pay zone is a fine
grained sandstone with low porosity (12% average) and very low permeability
(from 2 to 4 millidarcies). Furthermore, the reservoir is believed to be
compartmentalized by minor though sealing faults. Due to the poor and varying
reservoir parameters (thickness, porosity, permeability, etc.) and the lack of
definition of its limits, it is impossible to make an accurate estimate of
commercial recoverable reserves with any confidence before drilling additional
wells, continuing detailed geophysical surveys, and introducing modern
processing and interpretation techniques. This is particularly true in regard
to the lateral dimensions of the Meskala reservoir in an E-W direction since
all the wells drilled or currently being drilled in the discovery area lie,
with the exception of one well, on a north-south axis.
Exploration Objectives and Project Design
3.08     In view of the fact that the Meskala discovery is not associated with
the conventional structural traps, and due to the presence of Triassic gas in
the nearby Toukimt field and OTA-2 well, the strategy for further exploration
and appraisal of the Meskala area has been designed with a view to:



- 19 -
(a) identifying trends in the reservoir where it is most productive;
(b) testing and stimulating wells to ascertain their gas and liquid productive
capacity; (c) exploring for the presence of gas reservoirs in the areas around
the Meskala discovery (within the Meskala horst block) where gas shows/high
pressure is known to exist; and (d) assessing the potential of the Paleozoic.
3.09     These objectives have been encompassed in a program proposed by
ONAREP including the drilling of four exploratory wells and five appraisal
wells, a high resolution seismic survey, and an airborne gravity magnetic
survey. All the wells would be drilled with the Triassic (gas bearing horizon
in MKL-101) as the primary objective and the Paleozoic as a secondary
objective. A few of the wells will be deep wells with an objective to test
the deeper Paleozoic (Ordovician to Carboniferous) horizons (see IBRD Map
17122 Annex 2.1, p.8). The wells would be drilled within an area in the
Essaouira Basin of approximately 560 km2: the Essaouira Appraisal Area shown
in IBRD Map 1688CR (see also Annex 3.1 for the proposed objectives and
locations of wells).
3.10     Two appraisal wells (MKL-105 and MKL-106) would be drilled initially
about two kilometers east and west of the discovery wells (more or less
straddling the line connecting the wells MKL-1, MKL-101, MKL-103). At the
same time, a high resolution and detailed seismic program will be conducted in
the immediate area of the discovery. As some of the seismic lines would pass
through the well locations, the outcome of drilling results and the high
resolution survey will test the relationship between seismic reflections and
reservoir rock development. If the results are encouraging, three more
distant step-out wells from the discovery well (MKL-107, MKL-108, and MKL-113)
would be drilled on the basis of the detailed seismic interpretation. The
drilling of the four exploratory wells (GTO-101, ZEL-101, ABK-1, GTE-101)
would proceed in parallel with appraisal of the local Meskala area. The
airborne gravity and magnetic survey would also be conducted to help determine
the limits of the Essaouira Basin, and provide an understanding of the
structural framework of the Basin and of the configuration of the Meskala
horst block and its relationship to the Basin as a whole. The synthesis of
the drilling results and the geophysical surveys and the periodic re-
interpretation of the data would provide a sound basis for estimating the
production potential and recoverable reserves of the area around the Meskala
discovery and the Meskala horst block.
3.11     If future appraisal wells prove as productive as the discovery well
(MKL-101) there would be the possibility to initiate a development program
before completing the drilling of all the wells. However, if the results are
discouraging, provisions will be made to divert one or two of the more distant
step-out wells and possibly one exploratory well to other areas, associated
with the exploration promotion program, provided that no foreign company has
elected to invest in that area and the area is judged as prospective. The
proposed program should also be flexible enough to allow for shifting the
emphasis from the immediate discovery area of MKL-101 to appraisal drilling in
the event that one or more of the exploratory wells test significantly better
than those in the MKL-101 area. The proposed program is conceived as a
minimum exploration/appraisal program for what is indicated at present to be
one of the most prospective areas in Morocco, particularly if it is viewed
within the context of the Meskala geological setting, the discontinuity and



- 20 -
weakness of the seismic reflections at or near the target horizons, and the
relatively poor characteristics of the reservoir gas bearing sands detected to
date.
Project Objectives and Description
3.12     The proposed project would have as its principal objective the
completion of the assessment of the Meskala gas discovery as well as the
evaluation of the petroleum potential of the greater Meskala horst block
initiated under loan S-18-MOR. It would also encompass in this regard (a) the
provision of the requisite technical, managerial and financial reinforcement
to ONAREP in order to execute this program and (b) preparative studies needed
for a possible future full scale development program. As follow-up of similar
activities financed under the current loan, the project would also aim at
ensuring continuation of current efforts by ONAREP directed towards attracting
additional foreign investment in exploration. The project would also aim at
helping ONAREP and the Government implement a medium-term institutional plan
for ONAREP which is currently being developed through a study financed under
the current loan.
3.13     The project would comprise the following components:
(a) De'lineation and appraisal of the Meskala discovery
(i)     Drilling two appraisal wells and three distant step-out
wells within the Essaouira Appraisal Area (Annex 3.1);
(ii)    Conducting a high resolution geophysical seismic survey
for about six crew months, around the Meskala discovery;
and,
(iii)   Conducting reservoir engineering study of the Meskala
area.
(b) Exploration of the potential of the regional Meskala horst block
(i)     Drilling four exploratory wells within the Essaouira
Appraisal Area (Annex 3.1);
(ii)    Expanding the coverage of the high resolution seismic
surveys (referred to above (a-ii)) if results are
encouraging;
(iii)   Conducting an airborne gravity and magnetic survey in
the Essaouira Basin.
(c) Exploration Promotion
(i)     Carrying out of up to 42 crew months of reconnaissance
seismic surveys in the Essaouira Basin (outside the
560 km2 Essaouira Apprai.sal Area), in the Hauts Plateaux
and in other onshore areas;



- 21 -
(ii)    Drilling of up to four exploratory wells, if the results
under (a) and (b) above are discouraging, and if
exploration drilling is warranted in new areas;
(iii)   Integration of geological studies, results of airborne
gravity and magnetic surveys and reconnaissance seismic
in specific data packages for areas and basins to be
offered to foreign companies; and public presentations
in selected locations of these areas to interested
companies.
(d) Technical support, studies and training
(i)     Provision of technical support for the operational
management of the exploration, drilling and completion
operations (to the extent of about 272 man-months), and
provision of skilled drilling technicians (to the extent
of about 150 man-months);
(ii)    Conducting studies (in addition to the reservoir and
geological promotional work) for comprehensive gas
utilization, and for detailed design of pipeline and
surface facilities; and the undertaking of the second
(or implementing) phase of an institutional study;
(iii)   Fellowship and in-country training of geologists,
geophysicists and engineers in areas related to ONAREP
activities.
3.14     Petroleum exploration programs, by their nature, are subject to
modifications as new information becomes available. The proposed project is
designed to be flexible and allow for changes within each component as
dictated by results during the implementation period. The Bank has already
reviewed and agreed, during appraisal, the locations for two appraisal wells
(MKL-105 and MKL-106) and three exploratory wells (GTO-1, ABK-1 and ZEL-101),
as well as the program for the airborne gravity magnetic survey, and the
program for the seismic surveys through June 1983. Another major ONAREP/Bank
review of the results of geophysical surveys and the drilling and testing
operations is presently targeted for around mid-1983, or as soon as the
preliminary interpretations of the initial 40 kilometers of high resolution
seismic are available. As recommended in paras. 3.10 and 3.11, in order to
optimize the drilling locations of the step-out wells, namely MKL-107,
MKL-108, and MKL-113, the drilling of these wells should not commence prior to
the interpretation of the high resolution seismic data and the integration of
the results of previous drilling operations and geological and geophysical
studies. Assurances have been obtained at negotiations from ONAREP to this
effect. Agreement on the location of these three step-out wells, the last
exploratory well (GTE-101), and the program for the still unallocated portion
of the seismic surveys, is in any event expected either around mid-1983 or at
subsequent ONAREP/Bank reviews which will be made every six months or at
shorter intervals as data becomes available from the drilling and seismic
work. ONAREP has agreed that it would not revise plans for drilling and
geophysical work under the project without the Bank's consent. It has also
agreed that it would not carry out additional exploration or appraisal



- 22 -
activity within the Essaouira Appraisal Area prior to reviewing any such
future plans with the Bank.
3.15     As several of the studies (reservoir, promotion, gas utilization and
institutional) provided for in the proposed project represent follow-up stages
to studies being undertaken under the current loan (para. 3.03), their precise
scope and timing will be determined during project implementation following
review of the results of the first study phase in each case. The detailed
design for the pipeline and surface facilities will only commence after an
appropriate level of reserves and well productivity are established, and
assurances have been obtained at negotiations from ONAREP to this effect.
ONAREP has also agreed to submit for Bank review all plans pertaining to the
development of resources discovered or appraised under the proposed loan.
Project Implementation
3.16     Overall responsibility.  ONAREP will have the overall responsibility
for implementing the project with the assistance of consultants whose
qualifications, terms and conditions of employment will be satisfactory to the
Bank and the Borrower. ONAREP has a competent and able top management and a
well-established operational base, but still suffers considerably from
shortage of experienced middle management in some important technical areas.
The technical assistance components of the proposed loan are aimed principally
at remedying this deficiency and will provide the key elements of
reinforcement needed for sound project implementation.
3.17     To this end, prime responsibility for the implementation of all
exploration activities in the Essaouira Appraisal Area will be assigned by
ONAREP to a joint task force to be set up especially for this purpose and to
comprise ONAREP personnel and an expatriate assistance team. The expatriate
specialists forseen include: one senior explorationist (or technical team
leader), one senior geophysicist, one senior subsurface geologist, one senior
drilling engineer, one drilling engineer, one well completion and testing
engineer, four drilling superintendents, and one coordinator: totalling 11
persons for two years duration. In order to ensure proper interfacing between
the task force and supporting personnel/functions within ONAREP, and to
maximize benefits from the transfer of know-how, each of the expatriates will
be attached to an appropriate division within ONAREP (paras. 5.05-5.07) and
will have as Moroccan counterpart either the division head or one of its
personnel. Close coordination would be assured through a system for daily
exchange of information and weekly meetings of the task force. A management
committee (to meet at least once every two months) would be presided over by
the Director General of ONAREP and would be responsible for overall review of
results, assessment of exploration strategy, updating of the exploration/
appraisal program, and task force management. In addition, head office
support would be provided by the technical assistance firm on special
request. With a view to obtaining assistance from specialists with particular
experience in the execution and management of gas and oil field operations,
ONAREP requested proposals for this technical assistance component of the loan
from several oil firms. The Bank agreed with ONAREP that oil companies would
be better able than petroleum consultants to provide the assistance needed,
particularly in regard integrated management of the Essaouira operations,
replacement of personnel if, and when, necessary, and consultative head office
support. Eight oil companies were approached, but only two proposals were



- 23 -
received; and of these ONAREP selected the offer made by Elf-Aquitaine
(France) (para. 3.32). The bid documents, selection, and contract terms were
reviewed and agreed by the Bank. Agreement was also reached on the key
expatriate members of the joint Elf Aquitaine/ONAREP task force who will be
in-place by Board presentation, and assurances were obtained that the
remaining members of the task force would be in-place by September 1, 1983.
In order to help ensure that the key expatriate specialists can be on board as
soon as possible, it has been agreed that initial funding for their services
(up to about September 1983) would be provided under Loan S-18-MOR (para.
3.04).
3.18     Drilling.  The drilling under the proposed project will be executed
by ONAREP which will utilize for this purpose its four heavy duty rigs and
labor. ONAREP's labor force would be reinforced through the contracting of
about six skilled technicians to help man two of its rigs. These technicians
will be supplied by FORASOL-FORAMER (France), an international drilling
contractor with prior experience in drilling in Morocco, selected by ONAREP
with the approval of the Bank (para. 3.32). All the drilling would be
supervised by specialized members of the task force.
3.19     Force account is a technically acceptable and most cost effective
alternative on the proposed project for the following reasons: (a) ONAREP's
four heavy duty rigs are well suited for the depth envisaged and are in
excellent condition; (b) during the course of this first project, ONAREP has
encountered operational problems arising from difficult drilling conditions in
the Essaouira basin and its own relative lack of experience in drilling and
completing high pressure gas wells. However, these difficulties can be
adequately surmounted through well placed assistance from external specialists
with a proven record of performance in the areas of drilling, completion,
testing, and geological evaluation of high pressure gas wells; (c) the
provision of externally contracted technicians to help man two of the rigs
will provide an additional assurance that ONAREP will upgrade its performance
to international industry standards, as these rigs are expected to act as pace
setters for the other drilling rig operations within the Essaouira Appraisal
Area; and, (d) the other alternatives available to ONAREP would have been
significantly more costly. ONAREP's costs for rig operations and maintenance
under the proposed arrangements will total about $12.0 million (including
about $2.0 million for the externally contracted drilling technicians and
about $1.5 million for the four superintendents to be provided under the task
force technical support contract). This is compared to an estimated total
cost of $27.0 million which ONAREP would incur if it were to contract
externally for all drilling rig and labor services required for the proposed
project.
3.20     Geophysical Surveys, Studies and Training.  The geophysical surveys
(the seismic and the gravity and magnetics) will be conducted by foreign
contractors under ONAREP's supervision. ONAREP has already selected CGG
(France) as seismic contractor following an international competitive bid for
these services, and Carson Geoscience (USA) as contractor for data acquisition
on the airborne gravity and magnetics survey - the only company at present
which can execute a combined survey of this type (para. 3.32). Both awards
were reviewed and approved by the Bank. The studies (reservoir, gas
utilization, promotion, institutional) and the engineering of pipeline and
surface facilities will be executed by experienced engineering or consulting

firms under contract to ONAREP on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank
(para. 3.31). The training program will be a slice of ONAREP's 1983-85
training plan and is detailed in Annex. 3.2.
Implementation Schedule
3.21     The project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 3.3.  It is
anticipated that the drilling of the appraisal and exploration wells would be
completed by end December 1984. Acquisition of gravity-magnetic data is
expected to start in January 1983, and be completed by May 1983, and
interpretation finalized by end November 1983. Seismic surveys are expected
to start in March 1983 and to be completed and interpreted by end September
1985. The studies would be carried out during the period October 1983 to June
1985. The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1985.
Project Costs
3.22     The proposed project is estimated to cost an equivalent of
US$106.2 million (including physical and price contingencies, duties and taxes
and the capitalized front end fee) of which US$75.2 million or 71% represent
the foreign exchange component. The cost estimate is based on early 1983
prices for contracts which have already been awarded (geophysical services,
task force support, and the services of drilling technicians), and on budget
estimates based on mid-1982 prices for the costs of drilling equipment and
materials and other project components. _/ A physical contingency of 10% was
applied to local and foreign costs with the exception of the gravity and
magnetic survey which entails a well-defined work program. Price escalation
for foreign costs has been assumed at 8% for 1982 and 1983, 7.5% for 1984 and
7% for 1985, and for local costs at 13.8% for 1982, 9% for 1983 and 1984, and
7.5% for 1985, with the exception of the contracts which have already been
awarded for which no escalation was included for 1983. 2-
3.23     The project cost is in line with industry costs in developing
countries, particularly if viewed in the light of the difficult drilling
conditions and the remoteness of the project area from infrastructural
facilities. Drilling costs were based on ONAREP's recent expenditures for
drilling activities as well as upon budget estimates for imported materials
and equipment. Costs for the geophysical surveys were based on the cost of
the contracts which have already been awarded. In estimating the cost of
technical support for the Essaouira task force and related studies a man-month
rate of $22,250 was used reflecting the contract already signed with Elf-
Aquitaine. 3/ This rate, though high, was deemed acceptable since ONAREP is
seeking a high level of expertise from an operating oil company where the
opportunity cost of personnel is high, and since the Elf-Aquitaine offer was

significant change in the cost of materials and services included in
the project had occurred in the period since project appraisal.

escalation in these subsequent years.

the best offer forthcoming from an oil company (para. 3.17). In estimating
the cost of other studies and technical assistance, a man-month rate of
$15,250 was used. 1/ Total man-months for the Essaouira task force support is
estimated at 272 man-months. Total man-months for the contracted drilling
technicians is estimated at 150 man-months, for (reservoir, promotional,
market and institutional) studies at 70 man-months, and for pipeline design at
100 man-months. The cost of the training program was estimated on the basis
of 215 man-months of fellowship training at an average cost of $4,650 per man-
month, and ten weekly seminars at an average cost of $20,000 per seminar.
(Annex 3.2).

Project Financing
3.25     The proposed loan of US$75.2 million would finance 100% of the
foreign exchange cost of all components of the project (see para. 3.28).
Local project costs of US$31 million equivalent (DH 195.3 million) would be
financed by the Government through annual budgetary allocations.

has at certain times in the last few years curtailed or delayed disbursement
of allocated budget funds. In present-day markets for oil industry goods and

services, delays in payments to supplier and service companies can easily lead
to depletion of stocks, and long interruptions and/or slow-down of activity.
In light of the priority accorded the rapid assessment of the commercial
potential of the Essaouira Appraisal Area, it is important that every effort
be made to ensure that ONAREP has sufficient funds to meet in a timely manner
the project's financing requirements. For this reason, direct payments
procedures for disbursement of proposed loan funds would be used whenever
possible. In addition a commitment from the Government was obtained at
negotiations that it would set the level of annual budgetary allocations to
ONAREP, and disburse funds so allocated in such a manner as to ensure that
ONAREP has, at all times, the cash required for adequate project
implementation. In view of the stringency in regard budgetary funds, the
Government has expressed the need to ensure that ONAREP does not withdraw more
funds than it needs in practice on its on-going operations. To this end,
assurances were also obtained from ONAREP that it will prepare all appropriate
documentation needed to assess its project financing requirements, including
cash budgets updated periodically in accordance with the actual schedule of
commitments, payments and volume of work performed. As a first step in this
direction, the Government and ONAREP were asked to agree on and submit to the
Bank a projected timetable for the allocation and release of funds to ONAREP
throughout the project implementation period. A detailed timetable for 1983
and summary timetables for 1984 and 1985 were reviewed during loan
negotiations, and an understanding was reached that detailed timetables for
1984 and 1985 would be prepared (in a provisional form in October 1983 and
October 1984, and final form in early 1984 and 1985) and submitted to the Bank
for review and comments.
3.27     As in the first exploration project, it is proposed that the Bank
loan be made to ONAREP with the guarantee of the Government of Morocco, in
order to ensure that the funds provided by the Bank are clearly additional to
the Government's contribution to the project. The loan would be made on
normal country terms: a 17-year repayment period including four years of
grace, and an assurance will be sought that the loan would be refinanced, in
whole or in part, at the Bank's option, from a subsequent loan for
development/production of petroleum resources identified or assessed under the
proposed project. ONAREP would bear the foreign exchange and interest
risks. However, given the nature of the proposed project, and ONAREP's near-
term financial position (paras. 6.07-6.09), as for the current project
assurances were obtained from the Government that (in addition to coverage of
project costs) it will ensure that ONAREP has available, through its annual
budgetary allocations, the funds required for the servicing of the proposed
loan for as long as this would be required.
3.28     Possibilities for cofinancing for the proposed project have been
explored by ONAREP and the Government. The Government has formally requested
cofinancing of $10.0 million from the OPEC Fund; however, the Fund has
informed the Government that no decision can be taken on its participation in
the project until late 1983. As regards export credits, ONAREP is also
presently discussing with Canadian agencies the terms and the maturities that
might be offered on purchase of certain drilling materials in order to
determine whether these would be appropriate for the project. As is the case
for most exploration projects, commercial bank cofinancing is not likely to be
available, particularly as ONAREP is still a non-revenue earning entity. As
the availability of cofinancing is still uncertain, it is proposed that the



- 27 -
Bank loan cover the full foreign exchange cost of the project. However, it
was agreed during negotiations that, in the event appropriate cofinancing was
obtained subsequent to Board Presentation and before December 31, 1983, the
Bank would cancel the corresponding portion of the Bank loan.
Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
3.29     The proposed Bank loan of US$75.6 million would finance 100% of the
foreign expenditures for all equipment, material and services, and training.
In the case of consultant services, the option of loan financing of 80% of
local costs is also allowed, in order to give the opportunity to local firms
to compete for these services; however, such loan financing of local costs is
not expected to exceed $4.0 million. Disbursement for geophysical and well
services would be conditional on Bank approval of the detailed program of the
surveys, well locations and drilling and testing programs (para. 3.14).
3.30     Disbursement of the Bank loan is expected as follows:
IBRD Fiscal Year         1984       1985       1986
US$ million
Increment                30.2       35.0       10.0
Cumulative               30.2       65.2      75.2
High rates of disbursement are foreseen for FY1984 and FY1985 since most of
the physical work will be carried out during these years. Disbursement is
expected to be completed by June 30, 1986. Annex 3.5 provides a detailed
breakdown of the disbursement schedule.
Procurement
3.31     The drilling, completion and testing of wells would be carried out by
force account (ONAREP's own rigs and labor) with Bank financed goods,
equipment and other service contracts (paras. 3.18 and 3.19). -   Goods and
services financed under the proposed Bank loan would be procured by
international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines, or
through limited international tendering (LIT) for speciality equipment,
materials and services provided only by few suppliers. The value of contracts
procured under ICB would total $38.0 millio 27; the value of contracts
procured under LIT would total $24 million -/.  In addition, direct purchases,
through ONAREP's own procedures, of spares and emergency equipment and
services costing less than US$150,000 equivalent would be allowed up to an
1/ Force account work under the project is estimated at $12.8 million.
2/ $21.0 million for drilling equipment and materials, and $17.0 million
for seismic surveys.
3/ $8.0 million for drilling goods, $11.0 million for drilling services and
$5.0 million for geophysical services.



- 28 -
aggregate amount of US$2 million (3% of the Bank loan). i/ All bid packages
having value of US$500,000 or above would be subject to Bank review prior to
contract award; other packages would be reviewed subsequently. Consultants
services would be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines.
3.32     In order to accelerate the assessment of the Meskala gas discovery
and to provide additional time for interpretation of the complex geological
picture, advance contracting is needed for the geophysical work, technical
assistance and some long delivery drilling equipment. The selection of
contractors for Essaouira task force support, supply of drilling technicians,
and geophysical surveys have already been made (paras. 3.17, 3.18 and 3.20) in
accordance with Bank guidelines. Advance contracting for the remaining items
will also be in accordance with Bank guidelines, and ONAREP is aware that all
advance contracting is at its own risk. The total amount of advance
contracting is estimated at $20 million, for which retroactive financing of
$7.0 million (9.3% of the total loan) would be required.
Training
3.33     ONAREP has prepared a comprehensive training program for the 1981-85
Plan period. As detailed in Annex 3.2, the proposed loan would finance both
fellowship and in-country training for professionals and technicians for a
total of 215 man-months of fellowship training plus 10 weekly seminars.
Fellowship training would include short and long term duration courses in
technical fields including geology, geophysics, drilling, drilling fluid
technology, well completion, production, and reservoir engineering. In
addition, the short seminars (of about one week duration) to be held in
Morocco will enhance technical and administrative skills and assist ONAREP's
staff in coping with specific operational problems. On-the-job training would
be accomplished as ONAREP's professionals work closely with their foreign
counterparts in the execution of the project drilling and seismic operating
studies. The formal training program will be periodically reviewed and
assessed during the course of project implementation.
Reporting Requirements
3.34     An understanding from ONAREP was obtained during negotiations that
project progress reports covering technical progress, costs, expenditure,
disbursement and management and operations will be provided by the borrower to
the Bank on both a monthly and a semi-annual basis. In accordance with
industry practice, and in order to allow the Bank to reach an informed
judgement on the progress of drilling and the locations of new wells (para.
3.14), weekly telexes summarizing drilling and testing status of the wells
would also be sent to the Bank. An understanding with ONAREP has been reached
on the format and content of these reports. Interim and final reports on
various studies would also be submitted to the Bank. Meetings will be held
1/ ONAREP's procurement procedures are similar to the LIT procedures of
the Bank; they allow, as an exception, procurement of spares and
emergency equipment and services, through direct order to a single
supplier after approval by ONAREP management and the Ministry of Finance.



- 29 -
every six months, or at shorter intervals as needed, to discuss past results,
future well locations and modifications to exploration strategy (para. 3.14).
Ecology and Safety
3.35     The exploration and drilling operations will take place in a barren
area of sparse population. Geophysical survey lines and drilling location
would be so selected with a view to avoiding close proximity to habitation and
water wells if and when they are present. Surface source water will be
protected through the following of oil drilling and cementing industry
standards.
3.36     Prospecting for and drilling through high pressure gas zones entails
some risk of blow-outs and possibly fire. The risk is, however, minimized
through the use of blow-out preventors, sophisticated instruments for
monitoring traces of gas in the drilling fluid, and the enforcement of strict
safety codes. ONAREP, in spite of some inefficiencies manifest in the
progress of its drilling and testing operations, is quite aware of the risks
involved and has maintained throughout the past several years an excellent
safety record.
IV. PROJECT RISKS AND JUSTIFICATION
4.01     The project carries technical and economic risks inherent in
petroleum exploration. In assessing these risks it is important to bear in
mind that the presence of natural gas and associated liquid condensates has
been established already by the tests of the MKL-101 and MKL-102 wells. The
uncertainties which remain relate to whether adequate reservoirs have been
formed to allow (a) accumulation of these hydrocarbons in sufficient
quantities and (b) their production at an economic rate.
4.02     The geologic risk in the project, therefore, involves principally two
factors: the extent and quality of the Triassic reservoir. Even though the
four Triassic penetrations in the Meskala area to date (TK-201, MKL-1,
MKL-101, and MKL-102) have all encountered a productive reservoir, it is
possible that the reservoir may prove to be of limited extent. Furthermore,
the quality of the Triassic reservoir in the two wells tested to date (MKL-101
and MKL-102) is near the lower limit for commercial development in terms of
sustained rates of productivity and drawdown of reservoir pressure.
Offsetting the first of these factors is the possibility that other
reservoirs, either in the Triassic or in the underlying Paleozoic, will be
found elsewhere in the project area as a result of the proposed appraisal and
exploratory wells. Offsetting the second is the fact that any appreciable
improvement in the reservoir parameters in new wells would make possible
substantial economic returns. In order to increase the prospects of finding
better quality reservoirs, the project provides for nearby exploratory wells
as well as Meskala appraisal wells. Moreover, care has been taken to minimize
these risks through appropriate and flexible project design. The high
resolution seismic survey plus carefully planned well locations and detailed
analysis of reservoir rock characteristics and pressure performance on long
duration production tests should provide the basis for an early determination
of reservoir limits and productivity, and provision has also been made to



- 30 -
allow for modifying the balance and specific location of the well drilling
program on the basis of the initial geophysical and drilling results.
Maintaining flexibility of this kind, will also minimize the risk that is
posed by the possibility that the project may prove to be of inadequate scope
to establish the basis for a subsequent economic development program, or
conversely, the risk that it may be large and result in overdrilling.
4.03     An additional technical risk is posed by the possibility that, even
given reasonable reservoir conditions, ONAREP cannot efficiently drill, test,
and complete the deep high pressure gas wells in such a manner as to achieve
their full productive potential. This risk has been minimized by the
inclusion in the project of substantial technical assistance (para. 3.17).
4.04     The main economic risk is posed by the uncertainty as to the
percentage of eventual recoverable (as opposed to in-place) reserves both in
aggregate terms as well as in terms of the rate of their extraction. However,
in light of currently available data, it is considered very likely that future
drilling can establish recoverable reserves in the local Meskala area of 330
BCF of gas and 20 MM Bbl of associated liquids. For plateau production as
indicated in the table below, total investment requirements for exploration
and development of such reserves can be estimated in present value terms (at
10% discount rate) at about US$404 million, and the net present value on the
program at about US$286 million. The rate of return on the investment would
be 24% (Annex 4.1). This is calculated on the basis of high drilling costs in
Meskala (a per well estimate of about 1982 US$6.0 million), of low
productivities and recoveries per well (a maximum production rate per well of
3 MMCFD and 190 BD and total reserves recoverable per well of about 7 BCF and
0.6 MM Bbl of liquids), and on the assumption that presently holding petroleum
prices will remain constant (in real terms) throughout the production life.
A Meskala Reserves and Production Scenario
Recoverable reserves                    NPV at 10% (in US$ million)

Total (million TOE)         11            Total output                      804

Total (million TOE p.a.)   1.1    Net present value                         286
Relative proximity of Meskala to potential gas consumers, and the high
proportion of condensates contained in the gas, are positive factors
influencing the economics of a possible development of Meskala. However, even
with 50% less liquids in the production than in the case cited above, the
estimated rate of return on investment is over 18%. Acceptable rates of
return are achieved for other probable scenarios assuming gas reserves in the
Meskala area of 50% less than indicated above and (except for the worst
reserves case considered) for a scenario assuming a 15% decrease in price
below recently established levels (Annex 4.1). These estimates do not take



- 31 -
into account the possible presence of gas over a large area in Essaouira,
possible production from the Paleozoic or possible improvement in the proven
Triassic reservoir. On the other hand, if the reservoir deteriorates away
from the discovery, or is absent, the prospects for an economic development of
Meskala would be limited. The proposed program is designed to appraise the
discovery and, at the same time, explore other portions of the regional
Meskala horst. It is considered to be best suited to resolve these
uncertainties, and will provide for an evaluation of the discovery and
potential extensions in the shortest time and least costly manner. Overall,
the investment risk involved in the exploration program is judged to be
reasonable given the encouraging results to date for an economic development
of Meskala and the implications for Morocco's future energy investment
strategy.
4.05     The promotional components of the proposed project, principally the
reconnaissance geophysics and the technical assistance, are designed to
attract new investment in exploration in Morocco. While it is not certain
that new foreign investment would be forthcoming even with this additional
information, the active encouragement and promotion of new investment in
exploration along the lines proposed represents a justifiable strategy for
Morocco given its promising potential. To the extent this effort to interest
foreign companies is successful, this will (i) increase the exploration
investment and provide additional information with regard the petroleum
potential of Morocco; (ii) accelerate the discovery of commercial
hydrocarbons;, and (iii) relieve ONAREP from spreading its resources over
extended aKeas of the country and make it possible for it to focus on the
immediate problem of evaluating the Meskala gas area.
V. THE BORROWER
Background
5.01     The borrower of the proposed loan, L'Office National de Recherches et
d'Exploitations Petrolieres (ONAREP), is Morocco's recently established
national oil and gas, and oil shale, exploration and production company. As
such, ONAREP is the successor in the petroleum and oil shale fields of the
Bureau de Recherches et de Participations Minieres (the State enterprise which
had, from 1958 to 1981, been responsible for both petroleum and minerals
exploration and development), and has had transferred to it through Government
decisions all BRPM's technical staff, assets, and operations in petroleum and
oil shale activities.
5.02     ONAREP was instituted as a wholly-owned public enterprise by the
Dahir (law) of November 10, 1981. This Dahir is complemented by a Decree of
November 29, 1982, governing the framework for ONAREP's administration and
management. These laws also make ONAREP subject to the decrees of
April 14, 1960 and June 30, 1962, which regulate the State's financial control
of all public or State-funded commercial establishments.
Statutory Functions and Administration
5.03     ONAREP is authorized through its statutes to undertake all
industrial, commercial and financial activity compatible with the objective of
accelerating development of indigenous petroleum and oil shale resources. To



- 32 -
this end, it can (i) explore for and exploit such deposits; or (ii) form or
take participation in companies, or promote any action by companies, aiming at
either the exploration, development, treatment, or commercialization of
hydrocarbons and oil shale.
5.04     ONAREP operates under the tutelage of the Ministries of Energy and
Mines and of Finance, and is governed by an Administrative Council and a
Committee of Directors. The Administrative Council is headed by the Prime
Minister (as President), and includes as members the Ministers of Energy and
Mines, Finance, Planning, Interior, Commerce and Industry, Transport,
Equipment, Labor, and the Head of the governmental authority for economic
affairs. The Committee of Directors is headed by the Minister of Energy and
Mines and includes the Ministers of Finance and Planning, the Head of the
economic affairs authority, or their representatives.
Management and Functional Structure
5.05     The responsibility for managing ONAREP rests with a General Director,
assisted by a Secretary General. Since his assumption of his post with the
institution of ONAREP, ONAREP's General Director has re-organized the company
into two Directorates (for petroleum exploration and for technical
operations), and three divisions (for oil shale, financial, and administrative
affairs). The two Directorates, who will have prime responsibilities in the
execution of the proposed project, are organized along functional lines as
described in the following paragraphs (see also Annex 5.1).
5.06     The Direction de l'Exploration Petroliere (DEP) comprises three basic
divisions: (i) the division for regional exploration which consists of teams
of geologists and geophysicists assigned to each of several regional basins
onshore and offshore who are charged with the study, planning, or supervision
of exploration work in these areas; (ii) the division for subsurface studies
which is charged with the geological supervision of wells drilled either by
ONAREP on its own or by ONAREP's partners; and (iii) the division for
petroleum participations whose functions include the promotion of foreign
participations in exploration and production, the administrative follow-up of
joint-venture agreements, and the economic study of petroleum prospects. In
addition to these three divisions, the Directorate includes two Departments
(for geophysics and surface geology) and two services (for mapping and
documentation).
5.07     The Direction Technique (DT) has four divisions: (i) the drilling
division which is charged with the responsibilities of design and supervision
of drilling, well testing, and completion operations; (ii) the drilling
operations division which executes these programs; (iii) a production division
responsible for the planning and supervision of petroleum development
projects, atd (iv) an equipment division which procures and maintains
equipment and consumables and provides other general logistics support. In
addition to the four divisions, this Directorate spans a department for
administration (in charge inter alia with the management of ONAREP's drilling
school), and a service for technical studies.

Institutional Capabilities, Staffing and Training
5.08     At present, ONAREP has a total of nearly 1,000 employees of whom
about 90 are geologists/geophysicists or engineers. The Direction Technique
has the major share of personnel, about 615, including 23 engineers, and 10
drilling crews. The Direction de l'Exploration Petroliere is next in line
with about 140 employees, including 40 professionals.
5.09     Except for a small number of expatriates, almost all of ONAREP's
permanent employees are Moroccan. In addition, three teams of expatriate
petroleum specialists are now working within the organization under two-three
year bilateral assistance contracts: (i) a team of six Soviet geologists
working since 1981 on special studies within the DEP; (ii) a team of six
Rompetrol geologists and engineers working individually for several DEP
divisions also since 1981; and (iii) a team of five US specialists in Rabat
since September 1982 supported by US Aid under a contract with the Bechtel
Corporation. The US team is constituted by a senior geologist (who is acting
as advisor to the director of the DEP), a senior geophysicist, a senior
drilling engineer (who is acting as advisor to the director of the DT), a
senior production engineer, and a team coordinator.
5.10     The above external assistance is expected to help ONAREP cope with
some of the general institutional problems which it has faced: (i) a
relatively thin staff, particularly at middle-management levels; (ii) a
competent but over-extended senior management stretched by the need to handle
day-to-day operational concerns; and (iii) a mostly young technical staff who
must rely primarily on experience gained in prior BRPM exploration (as opposed
to field development) oriented activities within Morocco. The scope of the
work needed to rapidly assess the prospectiveness of the project area, the
special technical difficulties posed by the high pressure gas formations in
Essaouira, and the need to ensure a high level of managerial and technical
coordination of the work to be performed, have led ONAREP to request
additional special assistance Lhrough the proposed loan for the technical
support to be integrated into the task force constituting the Essaouira
Appraisal Area management team. As detailed in para. 3.17, this joint task
force is expected to include eleven expatriates spanning the range of
disciplines needed to supplement ONAREP's personnel in the management and
follow-up of Essaouira area operations and will provide the key elements of
reinforcement needed to ensure efficient execution of the Essaouira program.
5.11     The consultancy services for exploration promotion provided for under
the proposed loan are designed to bolster ONAREP in a parallel but ultimately
equally important area of its responsibilities. ONAREP is also counting on
the experience to be gained by its personnel working alongside the expatriate
specialists and, for the medium-term, on the transfer of know-how through
expected future joint activities with its foreign partners. Within the
context of the expansion in petroleum activity envisaged in the 1981-85 Plan
(para. 1.33), it also has an ambitious five-year master plan for training of a
number of its personnel through short or longer term courses in petroleum
institutes and universities abroad. Assistance provided through the training
component in the proposed loan would support an essential first phase of the
overall training program; and a follow-up review of remaining needs is planned
within the context of the Institutional Study (para. 5.18-5.20).



- 34 -
Accounts, Control and Audit
5.12     Moroccan accounting is based on and follows the French Plan Comptable
of 1957. The system allows clear and certain interpretation of the content of
any particular account, and there has been no significant difficulty in
adapting it to the specific needs of the petroleum sector. In parallel with
its general accounts, ONAREP also keeps both budgetary and analytical
accounts. Neither of the latter accounts have provided in practice, however,
a sufficiently adequate basis for management information and follow-up of
current operations. For this reason, an overall review of ONAREP's accounting
and budgeting practices, and recommendations for an improved management
information system, is also included in the work assigned the management
consultants under the Institutional Study. -
5.13     ONAREP must submit to a strict control by the State on all decisions
or transactions of any financial impact. The principal features of the system
are (i) prior approval of annual budgets; and (ii) tight control in budget
execution through a priori screening of all commitments and expenditures. As
for other public or State-funded institutions, the control is exercised by the
Minister of Finance, Ministry divisions, an ONAREP Controller (appointed by
the Minister) and "Agents Comptables" (appointed by ONAREP on the Minister's
recommendation). The Minister of Finance holds the prerogative of approval of
budgets, and the Controller, the Ministry's prime agent for control of ONAREP,
the responsibility for a priori approval of all proposed commitments. He must
agree to all awards of contracts of any significance, and must ensure that the
goods or services are provided for in the budget and that ONAREP has
sufficient credits to cover the expense. The Agent Comptable's prime
responsibility is to countersign and screen every payment order, for proof
that the goods and services were procured in accordance with the rules and
that the funds were appropriately committed.
5.14     The control system is generally rigidly applied, wide-ranging and
time consuming, and has proved, in the past, particularly costly for a company
like ONAREP which must, to become more efficient, align its procurement and
payments practices to those generally holding in the international market for
oil industry goods and services. There is, at present, however, a growing
recognition within the Government of the inefficiencies generated by such
strict a priori State financial control, and a special concern lest a rigid
application of the rules delay progress in the assessment of the Meskala
discovery. Special instructions have recently been given by the Prime
Minister and the Minister of Finance to Government staff to streamline
procedures and curtail unneccessary delays in the case of ONAREP, and
substantial improvement has since occurred on several fronts: procurement and
purchasing, staffing, and timing for approvals of payments and budgetary
appropriations, among others. Whereas at one point, the set of procedures
constituting the control system was expected to have a marked negative impact
on the progress of ONAREP's work, the improved situation appears, for the
present, to be satisfactory. Further improvement in this domain will also be
sought through the Institutional Study, which will help ONAREP to prepare
itself for an eventual change to a system of a posteriori control, presently
being considered for it by the Government.



- 35 -
5.15     As currently practiced, financial control by the State also
encompasses a posteriori control of results through (i) monthly and annual
comparison of the three sets of distinct accounts kept by the company, its
controller, and the Agent Comptable; and (ii) annual review of these accounts
by the Ministry of Finance and the Cour des Comptes. In addition to this,
Loans S-18-MOR and 2114-MOR require annual audits by independent auditors of
the Borrower's accounts, and during negotiations of the proposed loan ONAREP
will be asked to continue to have its annual financial acccounts audited by
independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank, and to submit to the Bank its
audited annual accounts not later than six months after the end of each
financial year.
5.16     The first accounts that were submitted for audit by the BRPM (the
original borrower for Loan S-18-MOR) were for FY1981. However, these accounts
could not be certified by the auditors principally because of delays in the
taking of physical inventories and lack of adequate documentation on BRPM's
investments in mining subsidiaries (a significant proportion of its asset
base) and its position on suppliers and clients accounts. BRPM is no longer a
Bank borrower; nevertheless the BRPM and the Government have both been urged
to remedy this situation in view of the importance of the BRPM as public
holding company in the mining sector.
5.17     All assets and liabilities relating to ONAREP's operations were
transferred from BRPM to ONAREP by virtue of the Dahir of November 10, 1981,
and subsequent Government decrees, and have been incorporated into ONAREP's
opening balance sheet as of January 1, 1982. The auditors have been asked to
review this balance sheet. As a result, they have developed a plan of action
to enable ONAREP's accounts to be the subject of a qualified opinion regarding
certain inventories and assets by December 31, 1982, and expected to be the
subject of an unqualified opinion as at December 31, 1983. ONAREP and the
Government have agreed to this plan 1/, which is currently being implemented,
and on this basis the Assumption Agreements for Loan S-18-MOR (which
substitute ONAREP for BRPM as borrower for the loan) have been made effective
(para. 3.04). However, in order to ensure against delays in the
implementation of the action plan, an additional assurance that ONAREP will
complete execution of the plan by end-1983, was obtained at loan negotiations.
The Institutional Study
5.18     The technical assistance cited in paras. 5.10 and 5.11 above is
designed principally to ensure that ONAREP is able to assume the expanded
responsibilities entailed in the execution of a project of the proposed scope
and magnitude. In parallel with this, the Government, ONAREP and the Bank
have agreed that substantial benefits can also be derived from an expert
reassessment of ONAREP's present institutional setting, objectives and
capabilities and the setting of a plan of action for the company's
transformation and development in the future. This is in line with the
1/ Principally covering: (i) physical inventories of fixed assets and
stocks; (ii) justification of suppliers' and clients' accounts;
and, (iii) clarification of total tax liabilities for 1982 and prior
years.



- 36 -
Government's intention of exploring all the options available to it in
accelerating exploration and development of domestic oil and gas resources,
and ONAREP's need to ensure that it prepares itself within the coming few
years to better fulfill the role (or roles) assigned to it in this domain.
5.19     The first phase of the institutional study is being funded through
the current petroleum exploration loan; and is being carried out for ONAREP by
Arthur D. Little Inc. (USA). As per their proposal, the consultants' work
will proceed in five, more or less sequential steps: (i) a clarification of
measurable objectives for the company in light of the general objectives cited
in its statutes, its local and external environment and the nature of the oil
industry; (ii) a detailed technical assessment, in light of these objectives,
of all of ONAREP's present operations, and exploration of possible future
operations (such as the development and marketing of gas); (iii) an evaluation
of ONAREP's present management systems; (iv) selection for the Government and
ONAREP's consideration of one or more optimal organizational schemes for the
future covering a five year strategy for ONAREP, and general recommendations
vis a vis the relationship of the company to the Government, and other public
enterprises, the range of the companies' activities, the methods of its
financing, its overall organizational structure, and responsibilities of its
senior management; and finally, (v) preparation of a final detailed set of
recommendations vis a vis the companies' operational priorities, institutional
setting, structure, management systems and procedures, staffing and personnel
development. This first phase of the study, which commenced in January 1983,
is expected to require between four to six months and should therefore be
completed by end June 1983.
5.20     A provision is included in the proposed loan for a second or
implementing phase for the institutional study aimed at providing ONAREP with
the assistance required to put into place the consultants' recommendations.
Detailed terms of reference for this work will be developed by Arthur D.
Little as part of the first phase study, and will be reviewed by ONAREP and
the Bank prior to commencement of this work.
Insurance
5.21     ONAREP is insured with insurance companies in Morocco (who are in
turn reinsured in the international market) against third party liability
arising from accidents attributable to its operations. It has also adequate
coverage with such companies for its rigs and surface facilities in the event
of blow-outs, fire or cratering. An understanding has been reached with the
Government and ONAREP that in case of such blow-outs, fire or cratering,
ONAREP will be able to mobilize rapidly, either through budgetary advances or
complementary insurance, the funds needed to cover costs for the control of
the wells and redrilling, as well as clean-up costs and pollution liability.

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Current Financial Position
6.01     Opening Accounts.  ONAREP's opening balance sheet as of
January 1, 1982 is as follows:
Summary Opening Balance Sheet
as of January 1, 1982
DH million       US$ million         _
Net plant                                   88.9              14.1           18
Petroleum Exploration & Oil Shale          273.1              43.3           56
Investment in Affiliates                    35.8               5.7            7
Working Capital                             90.4              14.4           19
Total Assets                     488.2              77.5          100
Government Equity                          404.7              64.2           83
Provision for Pension Funds                 12.3               2.0            2
Long-Term Debt                              71.2              11.3           15
Total Liabilities                488.2              77.5          100
6.02     Capitalization.  Due to a long-standing Government policy to finance
as much as possible of the national petroleum exploration effort through
budgetary resources (and to the nature of the previously holding disbursement
procedures under the current petroleum loan 1/) 83% of ONAREP's capital, as of
January 1, 1982, was represented by Government equity. The debt incurred
under the current petroleum loan, as of end 1981, represented the remaining
major share of ONAREP's total capital. ONAREP's initial capitalization is
sound.
6.03     Assets.  As of January 1, 1982, net investment in petroleum
exploration and oil shale studies amounted to about DH273 (US$43) million, or
56% of ONAREP's total assets; about DH56 (US$9) million of this sum
represented expenses incurred on oil shale research and development, and about
DH217 (US$34) million net expenditure on petroleum exploration. ONAREP
follows (as did BRPM in prior years) accepted standards of writing off
unsuccessful exploration costs against equity. The net value of the petroleum
exploration investment is therefore indicative of expenditure which has not
yet been deemed unsuccessful. Of the above total sum, about DH126 (US$20)
million is attributable to the exploration effort in Essaouira, about DH55
(US$9) million principally to seismic and studies on several other onshore
areas (Boudnib, the Hauts Plateaux, Ksabi and Aknoul, etc.), and about DH36
(US$5) million to drilling and seismic work carried out either by ONAREP on
its own or through joint-ventures with APEX in the Gharb basin (para. 2.12).
1/ Which (until modified in late 1981) allowed withdrawals from major loan
categories only for reimbursement of expenditures already incurred
(para. 3.04).



- 38 -
A large proportion of this activity was supported through the current
petroleum exploration loan.
6.04     At present, ONAREP has only one affiliate, SCP, which it holds
jointly on a 50%-50% basis with a French Group in which SNEA is a major
partner. As of January 1, 1982, the value of this holding amounted to about
DH36 (US$6) million, or 7% of ONAREP's total assets.
6.05     Net plant as of January 1, 1982 amounted to about DH89 (US$14)
million, or 18% of total assets. About DH28 (US$5) million of this sum
represented drilling rigs and other equipment directly pertaining to well
drilling and seismic data acquisition operations, and about DHlII (US$2)
million investment to date in Toukimt development facilities (para. 2.14).
6.06     Working capital, as of January 1, 1982, amounted to about DH90
(US$14) million or 19% of total assets. This consisted of about DH94 (US$15)
million in inventories (mostly consumables for oil and gas wells); about DH91
(US$14) million in other short term assets (about 60% in clients and other
receivables, 30% in budgetary allocations, and 6% in cash and banks); and
about DH95 (US$15) million in current liabilities (about 48% in suppliers and
other creditors, 12% in fees and taxes, and 40% in short-term loans).
Future Finances
6.07     The 1982-84 period.  Over the medium- and longer-term, ONAREP is
expected to be in a position to benefit very favorably from a possible
commercial production of gas and condensates from Essaouira (and/or any
potential successful petroleum exploration investment by one of its foreign
partners). Nevertheless, confirmation of the commerciality of Meskala will
need to be preceded by an intensified exploration and appraisal drilling
effort. ONAREP's finances in the upcoming two-year period covering project
implementation will thus continue to be characterized by: (i) expanding
expenditures in exploration and studies, entailing parallel requirements for
the upgrading of plant, maintenance of adequate levels of inventories, and of
liquidity; (ii) a relatively minor income generation capability relying almost
exclusively on revenues from small gas fields shared with Apex and on small
profit from work (mostly hydrological drilling) performed for third parties;
and (iii) the need, therefore, to rely for the financing of a major share of
requirements on Government equity funds. ONAREP's projected requirements for
the 1982-84 period, and sources of financing, can be summarized as in the
following table (see also Annex 6.1):

Total Sources          400.0         1,775.0         2,175.0        345.2
6.08     ONAREP's requirements for the 1982-84 period are expected to total
DH2,175 (US$345.2) million, spanning DH1,080 (US$171.4) million for petroleum
exploration (50% of the total), DH207 (US$32.9) million for oil shale studies
(9%), DH736 (US$116.8) million for plant, including some development
investments (34%), and DH152 (US$24.1) million for working capital (7%).
About 44% of requirements would be financed through loans (principally the two
Bank loans for petroleum exploration and the Bank loan for oil shale studies)
and the remainder (55% of the total) by the Government budget.
6.09     In order for ONAREP to carry out its petroleum and oil shale programs
efficiently, it would need to ensure that it can maintain, at all times, an
adequate level of liquidity. The most appropriate measure of liquidity for
the company would be its quick ratio. With the view to helping ONAREP
maintain a sound financial position, assurances were obtained during loan
negotiations: (i) from ONAREP that it will take all necessary measures within
its power (including preparing all appropriate documentation needed to
periodically assess its liquidity position) to maintain, at all times, a quick
ratio of not less than 1.0; and (ii) from the Government that it would set the
level of its annual budgetary allocation to ONAREP, and disburse funds so
allocated, in such a manner as to ensure that ONAREP can maintain the
financial standard set above.
6.10     Longer-term Prospects.  Success on ONAREP's exploration and appraisal
efforts, and/or on exploration investments by foreign partners, would make
possible a transformation of ONAREP from an essentially exploration entity
into a revenue generating production company. Development projects would,
however, also require significant initial outlays of funds. No reliable year
by year projecting of the timing and magnitude of future development
investments, of financing requirements, and of benefits can yet be made. As



- 40 -
for the first project, assurances have been obtained from ONAREP that it will
submit to the Bank for review, any plans pertaining to the development of
resources discovered or appraised under the proposed loan (para. 3.15). In
addition, in order to help ensure that ONAREP's capitalization remains
satisfactory, assurances from the Government were obtained during loan
negotiations that it will not convert to debt any portion of its equity
contribution in ONAREP, without prior review of its plans with the Bank.
Moreover, within the context of arrangements agreed under the first petroleum
project, a Bank reassessment of ONAREP's finances is scheduled for no later
than March 31, 1984, the date for the end of the grace period on Loan S-18-
MOR. By that time, the Bank will decide whether the loan would be refinanced,
in whole or in part, from a subsequent loan for development/production of
petroleum resources identified under the first project. 1/ The proposed
project will provide the key data inputs to such an assessment and is expected
to be, by early 1984, sufficiently well advanced to permit a satisfactory
appraisal of ONAREP's future finances.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED
7.01     Assurances were obtained, during negotiations:
(a) from ONAREP that:
(i) drilling of the three step-out appraisal wells would not
commence prior to the interpretation of the high resolution
seismic data (para. 3.14);
(ii) exploration programs would be agreed on a semi-annual, or
as needed, basis and would not be altered without the
Bank's consent (para. 3.14);
(iii) it would not carry out additional exploration or appraisal
activity within the Essaouira project area prior to
reviewing any such future plans with the Bank (para. 3.14);
(iv) studies would not commence prior to Bank review,
and in particular, detailed design of the pipeline and
surface facilities would not commence until an appropriate
level of reserves and well productivity are established
(para. 3.15);
(v) it will submit to the Bank for review any plans pertaining
to development of resources discovered or appraised under
the project (para. 3.15);
1/ Loan S-18-MOR was made on terms and conditions similar to those applied
by the Bank at the time to engineering loans (i.e. a period of ten years
including a grace period of four years) with the provision that the term
of the loan would be extended to seventeen years if the exploration
project did not lead, by March 31, 1984, to a development project suitable
for Bank financing.



- 41 -
(vi) the Essaouira task force will be fully staffed by
September 1, 1983 (para. 3.17);
(vii) it will periodically prepare and update all documentation
needed to assess its project financing requirements
(para. 3.26);
(viii) it will have its annual accounts audited and submitted to
the Bank no later than 6 months after the end of the
calendar year (para. 5.15); and,
(ix) it will execute and complete by end-1983 an action plan to
resolve outstanding questions on its financial accounts
(para. 5.17)
(x) it will take all necessary measures within its power to
maintain, at all times, a quick ratio of not less than 1.0
(para. 6.09); and,
(b) from the Government that:
(i) it will provide ONAREP, in a timely manner, with sufficient
funds to finance project costs, service the proposed loan
and maintain at all times a quick ratio of at least 1.0
(paras. 3.26, 3.27 and 6.09); and
(ii) it will not convert to debt any portion of its equity

GEOLOGY AND EXPLORATION HISTORY
General Geology
1.       The entire sedimentary sequence from pre-Cambrian to recent is
represented in Morocco, overlying a continental granite basement. The older
Paleozoic sediments were apparently deposited in shallow marine basins located
on a broad platform of the ancient super-continent Pangea (Africa, the
Americas, Antarctica, Australia and India combined). Coarse clastic rocks
(sandstones), at least partly nonmarine, are the predominant rock type in the
oldest portion of the sedimentary column pre-Cambrian to Cambro-Ordovician.
Fine marine clastic rocks (shale and siltstones) are the predominant rock type
in the next youngest Ordovician and Silurian periods. These are overlain by
Devonian age marine shales and limestone. The Upper Paleozoic Carboniferous
beds are again predominantly marine shales and siltstones. Near the end of
the Paleozoic (Permian Period), the Paleozoic basins were uplifted and
subjected to subaerial erosion forming a distinct unconformity between the
Paleozoic and the overlying Mesozoic sediments. Even though Paleozoic rocks
are exposed at the surface in many parts of Morocco and have been penetrated
in a number of wells in the subsurface, little is known of the detail of the
Paleozoic basins, nor has the depositional environment been sufficiently
studied to give an indication of the distribution of rock types present in the
several sedimentary sequences. This is somewhat surprising since Paleozoic
rocks contain substantial quantities of oil elsewhere in North Africa,
principally Algeria.
2.       Following the uplift and partial removal of the Paleozoic beds by
erosion, a series of block fault basins were formed during the Permo-Triassic
period. These basins were precursors to the final split between Africa and
the Americas forming the Atlantic Ocean during early Jurassic time. The
Triassic beds which filled the block fault basins are nonmarine red shales and
siltstones with intervening layers of evaporites (predominatly salt), intruded
by dolerite sills (layers of fine-grained volcanic rock). In the deepest part
of the block fault basins (grabens) the salt layer became quite thick
(probably in excess of 1,000 m). Under later loading by subsequent sediments,
flowage of the plastic salt occured and produced a number of structures above
the salt interval. (See geological cross-sections IBRD Map 17122, p.8 of this
Annex).
3.       When the ultimate split between Africa and North America took place
in the early part of the Jurassic Period, extensive marine limestone
deposition occurred along the margin of the newly formed Atlantic Ocean. A
thick limestone bank, possibly a barrier reef, was formed at the edge of the
African continental margin with lagoonal or "back-reef" deposits of limestone,
shale, and evaporites covering most of the northern and western portions of
onshore Morocco. These "back-reef", predominantly limestone, deposits
continued throughout the Jurassic and into the Cretaceous period becoming more
clastic during the Cretaceous burying of the barrier reef. The seaward edge
of the Jurassic carbonates is preserved in the offshore of southwestern
Morocco.

Page 2 of 8
4.       During the Cenozoic Tertiary period all of Morocco, except the
coastal area, became emergent and subject to erosion. Compressional forces
(likely due to a collision with southern Europe) formed the Middle, High and
Anti-Atlas mountains and the Riff overthrust belt along the Mediterranean
Sea. This structural activity reached its climax during the Miocene epoch
(Upper Middle Tertiary), and some movement is still taking place. The
Tertiary compression introduced a great deal of complexity into Moroccan
geology. Basins seen today are only portions of former basins; the other
portions are found as remnants in the uplifted mountains, themselves complexly
structured. Tertiary sediments are predominantly shallow marine to nonmarine
shales and sandstones near the coast, and nonmarine intermontane clastics in
the interior.
5.       Basins preserved to the present include; the Mediterranean Coastal
and Gharb Basins filled principally with Tertiary sediments underlain by
folded Mesozoic sediments; the Hauts Plateaux, Guercif, Essaouira and Atlantic
Coastal (Tarfaya, Ifni and Souss/Agadir Basins) filled principally with
Mesozoic sediments underlain by Paleozoic sediments; and the Doukkala, Tadla,
Boudnib, Ouarzazate and the Saharan Basins filled principally with Paleozoic
sediments.
History of Petroleum Exploration
6.       Exploration for oil and natural gas has been conducted in Morocco
since 1928. The only company active prior to Independence in 1956 was the
French company, Societe Cherifienne des Petroles (SCP). Following
Independence, a petroleum code was enacted which provided for both state
agency and foreign oil company participation in exploration and development
activities. The BRPM (ONAREP's predecessor as State agency for petroleum
exploration) acquired 50% of SCP at that time as well.
7.       Prior to Independence, approximately 100 exploratory wells were
drilled by SCP, resulting in 11 small oil discoveries in the Gharb Basin.
These discoveries were made at shallow depths and produced from folded Riff
(principally Miocene) sediments and pre-Riff Jurassic limestones, as well as
from weathered granite along regional fault trends in the southeastern portion
of the Basin. All the fields were very small and production from them peaked
at about 2,200 BD in 1954. A 12th field was discovered by SCP in 1958 and is
still producing very small quantities today, all other fields having been
abandoned. The potential for further discovery in this area has been largely
exhausted. Another discovery was made by SCP at Sidi Rhalem in the Essaouira
Basin in 1961. Rhalem produces oil from the lower portion of the Middle
Jurassic (Argovian) limestone on a large structure overlying a Triassic salt
dome. The field itself is quite small but it helped to bring oil production
to an all-time peak of 2,900 BD in 1963. Rhalem was the last oilfield
discovered. The total of recoverable oil found to date approximates 15
million barrels, of which roughly one million barrels remain to be produced.
Current production is about 350 BD, about 80% from Rhalem.
8.       The first gas discoveries were made by SCP in 1968 at both Kechoula
and Jeer in the Essaouira Basin from an Argovian limestone reservoir on large
structures overlying Triassic salt features. American Petrofina (APEX)
discovered another gas field at DRJ in the Gharb Basin in 1972. The DRJ field
reservoir is a Miocene sand lens enclosed by shale. It has since been found



- 48 -                      ANNEX 2.1
Page 3 of 8
that the gas producing sand lenses in the Gharb Basin may be recognized by
their seismic amplitude anomalies (bright spots). Seven additional gas fields
have been found since DRJ, five in the Gharb and two in Essaouira. At present
gas is produced from four fields at cumulatively about 8.2 MMCFD; remaining
producible reserves from these fields total approximately 40 BCF. Six of the
already discovered fields remain to be developed, four in the Gharb Basin and
two in Essaouira. Toukimt in the Meskala area of the Essaouira Basin is the
largest of these undeveloped fields which are together estimated to contain a
total of 25 BCF of recoverable gas reserves and one million Bbl of recoverable
liquid condensates. The recent Meskala gas/condensate discovery from presalt
Triassic siltstone (paras. 18-22) is not yet included in the recoverable
reserve category although early indications are that this discovery may be
quite large in comparison to previous discoveries in Morocco.
9.       Since Independence, some 103 significant exploratory wells have been
drilled in the search for oil and gas. Of these, 50 were drilled by ONAREP
and SCP and 53 by foreign companies. As mentioned above (paras. 7 and 8),
eleven of these resulted in discoveries (ten gas and one oil). Substantial
shows were encountered in two other wells: the MO-2 well drilled by Esso,
offshore Tarfaya and the MKL-1 drilled by BRPM in the Meskala area
(para. 20). The MO-2 well tested heavy (110 API) oil at the rate of 2,700 BD
from an Upper Jurassic Malm limestone reservoir at the seaward limit of the
extensive limestone bank underlain by a Triassic salt structure. ESSO
estimated the recoverable reserves for the structure to be about 32 million
barrels which is insufficient for commercial development in water depths
approaching 100 m. Lesser shows were encountered in 14 other wells but
further study could indicate that some of these may be quite important, e.g.
the oil shows (which were not tested) in a Devonian reefal limestone in well
EBA-1 in the Doukkala basin. Overall, the above-mentioned exploratory
drilling activity was far from uniform with nearly 50% of the wells being
located in three basins: Tarfaya, the Gharb, and Essaouira.
10.      Foreign companies became active in Morocco shortly following the
enactment of the new petroleum code in 1958. The first exploratory license
was taken by AGIP on onshore Tarfaya in 1958. Esso signed the first offshore
license, also in the Tarfaya Basin in 1967. Other foreign licenses followed
and activity remained modestly high until 1973. A downturn in activity
followed Esso's relinquishment of the offshore Tarfaya license probably as a
result of the fact that the best oil discovery in the country thus far was
believed to be noncommercial in the environment in which it was found.
Foreign company activity remained at a low ebb during the mid-1970s.
Subsequently, Morocco made substantial efforts to attract oil companies during
the late 1970s and entered into contracts with Phillips (on license areas in
Hauts Plateaux and offshore Essaouira) and SNEA (in the Gharb and adjacent
areas of the pre-Riff domain). Both of these companies have since
relinquished their rights. Perhaps encouraged by ONAREP's Meskala discovery
or perhaps by increasing worldwide oil prices, three foreign companies have
entered into contracts during 1980/81. Arco obtained an offshore license in
the Souss Basin (offshore Agadir) and has completed seismic surveys and
drilled one well. Another well is being considered. Amoco obtained two
offshore licenses in the Mediterranean Coastal Basin and has just completed an
offshore seismic survey. Mobil acquired a license offshore Tarfaya, where
Esso had explored previously, and is preparing to commence an additional
seismic survey. Discussions are underway with one or two other companies at

this time. ONAREP is continuing its evaluation of the Meskala discovery and
SCP is currently drilling an important deep test in the Jeer field.
General Prospectivity of Morocco
11.      Even though discoveries to date have been modest, in view of the wide
range in oil and gas shows, from Ordovician to Miocene, Morocco must be
considered to be worthy of continued exploration. All of the necessary
elements, i.e., source rocks, reservoir rocks, traps and sealing sediments,
are present throughout the country. Probable hydrocarbon source rocks
include, from youngest to oldest, Miocene shales, Jurassic shales and
limestones of the "back-reef" facies, and Paleozoic shales (Carboniferous,
Devonian, Silurian and Ordovician). Except for the Miocene shales which are
restricted to the Gharb Basin, the potential source rocks cover a wide area of
Morocco both onshore and offshore. Problems with both the richness and
maturation of the potential source rocks indicate modest yield and a
propensity for gas.
12.      Potential for traps both structural and stratigraphic is high in
Morocco. These traps originate from Tertiary compressional features, the
flowage of Triassic salt and/or block faults in the Triassic and Paleozoic
section.
13.      Seals preventing upward migration and loss of generated hydrocarbons
are numerous and extensive. They include shales and dense limestones and, in
particular, the Triassic saLt.
14.      The major obstacle to hydrocarbon accumulation in Morocco is the
scarcity of good reservoir rocks. Even in discovered fields, other than the
shallow Miocene gas reservoirs in the Gharb Basin, reservoirs are of overall
poor quality. By and large, the known potential reservoirs in the Jurassic
limestones, the Triassic siltstones, and the Paleozoic limestones and
sandstones are few and of poor quality. The understanding and prediction of
the distribution of reservoir rocks must be one of the highest priority for
continued exploration in Morocco.
Essaouira Basin Geology
15.      The Essaouira Basin is a fault block basin adjacent to and normal to
the present coastline of Morocco. A major WNW/ESE fault divides it from the
Doukkala Basin to the north. The basin extends southeastward to the vicinity
of Marrakesh and is bounded to the southeast by the foothills of the High
Atlas, although originally the basin extended beyond the High Atlas and was
combined with the Souss/Agadir Basin to the south. It is still connected to
the Souss Basin along the present coastline and offshore. It is also
genetically, related to and probably originally connected with the Hauts
Plateaux to the northeast. Its shape therefore is triangular and is about 85%
onshore. The basin fill is Triassic salt and redbeds overlying Paleozoic
sediments. The Triassic in turn is overlain by "back-reef" lagoonal Jurassic
limestones, shales and evaporites. The edge of the Jurassic limestone bank is
just offshore the present coastline. Two types of structure predominate:
block faulting below the Triassic salt, and salt flowage structures above the
salt affecting the Jurassic and younger rocks. Several high block fault
structures are known to be present in the pre-salt section. One of these is



- 50 -                     ANNEX 2.1
Page 5 of 8
the Meskala high fault block (horst). Post-salt structures are numerous and
include the Rhalem, Kechoula, Jeer, Toukimt and N'Dark fields. However, a
number of other salt-related structures have been drilled through the Jurassic
without success to date.
16.      The deep Paleozoic sediments beneath the regional unconfirmity
(para.1) have been seen in four wells drilled in the Essaouira Basin, all in
the Meskala area (see p.8 of this Annex). The section encountered in these
wells gives a good idea of the Paleozoic stratigraphy from the Upper Devonian
to the uppermost Ordovician. From top to bottom this section comprises dense
pelagic (outer shelf) Upper and Lower Devonian limestone separated by a Middle
Devonian shale (possible source rock) and Upper Ordovician shale, siltstone,
and conglomerates. The latter two are potential reservoir rocks but appear to
be of poor quality. Neither the younger Carboniferous nor the older than
Upper Ordovician rocks have been penetrated yet. These may have good
reservoir or good source rock or both. The Triassic section above the major
unconformity is a redbed sequence with a basal shale and siltstone (the
Meskala reservoir), a middle salt intruded with dolerites, and an upper
shale. The Jurassic section overlies the Triassic and consists of alternating
beds of shale, limestone and evaporites (principally anhydrites). The
Argovian limestone reservoir occurs in the lower middle portion of the
Jurassic and the intervening shales are believed to be the source for the oil
and gas found in the Jurassic. The area is capped by a relatively thin veneer
of Cretaceous limestones and shales of little significance in the basin. The
depth to the Paleozoic unconformity is about 3,000-3,500 m on the high blocks
and exceeds 5,000 m in the bottom of the grabens. The geothermal regime is
normal, about 1.20 F/100 ft. and the sediments are thoroughly compacted with
high acoustic velocities and relatively little acoustic contrast. Seismic
data is good to excellent down to the top of the Triassic. Below that the
data is fair to poor on the high blocks and nonexistent in the graben. The
one or more layers of dolerite in the Triassic are highly reflective and tend
to mask the deeper information which, especially from the low acoustic
contrast reservoir is very weak.
17.      The Essaouira Basin is the most productive basin found in Morocco to
date. The four gas fields (Jeer, Kechoula, Toukimt, and N'Dark) and one
oilfield (Rhalem) contain the majority of Morocco's unproduced reserves of oil
and gas and the Meskala gas discovery may prove to be the most significant
find in the country to date. Substantial additional potential exists in both
the Jurassic and Triassic reservoirs as well as in the underlying Paleozoic.
Recent seismic surveys have indicated a number of potential Paleozoic traps
beneath the unconformity. Offshore potential would include Cretaceous
sandstones overlying salt structures seaward of the Jurassic limestone bank
("barrier reef"). This concept has not been well tested to date since most of
the identified structures are seaward of the 200 m isobath. The Cretaceous
reservoirs may be of better quality, however.
The Meskala Discovery
18.      The Meskala field was discovered upon completion of the MKL-101 well
in December 1981. This well flowed gas and condensates at several rates of
which the most efficient was 6 MMCFD plus 510 BD of condensates on a 1/4-in
choke with 4,800 psi flowing pressure at the surface. The production was
obtained through casing perforations between depths of 3,374 to 3,392 m



ANNEX 2.1

opposite the upper portion of a fine-grained Triassic sandstone. This well
was not stimulated nor was the entire reservoir perforated so it may have had
potential for higher sustained flow rates. Neither was it subjected to the
rigor of a long duration test. One appraisal well, the MKL-102, some 1.6 km
north-northeast of the discovery, has since been drilled and is currently
undergoing long duration tests. The MKL-102 has tested gas at significantly
lower rates, approximately 1.1 MMCFD plus 85 BD condensate on a 1/8 in choke
with 3,100 psi flowing pressure at the surface. Flow diminishes on the long
duration tests to 700 MCFD after 21 days. This is most likely due to the
condensation of liquids in the well bore and adjacent reservoir since the
bottom hole flowing pressure is less than the condensation pressure of about
5,700 psi. Formation damage equal to some 1,600 psi pressure was calculated
from test data. The reservoir quality and thickness was less in MKL-102 than
in MKL-101 and this is the probable cause for lower productivity.  However,
overselectivity of the perforated section (8 m perforated in 5 wire line
runs), in reducing the reservoir exposed to the perforations, may have also
played a role. This well was not properly stimulated either. Thus, while it
is probable that the productivity of MKL-102 may be improved, it is not as
good a well as the discovery. Two additional wells are drilling in the
vicinity of the Meskala discovery: MKL-103, 2 km south, and MKL-104, 5.5 km to
the south-southeast. (See IBRD Map 16880R).
19.      The Meskala field is productive of gas and condensate from a fine-
grained sandstone/siltstone of Lower Triassic age (may be Permo-Triassic).
The gas quality is good (since the gas contains little hydrogen sulfide and
inert gases), and the liquid content is high (some 85 bbl/MMCF). The
formation pressure is abnormally high, some 3,700 psi above hydrostatic. On
the other hand, the reservoir is quite poor with porosities in the 10-15%
range with correspondingly low permeability. The gross interval is
approximately 150 m in thickness with net reservoir averaging about 20% of
this. The reservoir appears to be continuous rather than lenticular, being
present in all penetrations to date (four). Seismic appears to indicate that
the reservoir is faulted which is confirmed by subsurface control available
from presently drilled wells. This may affect any future development plan.
20.      The presence of high pressure gas in the Triassic was noted in three
wells drilled on or adjacent to the Meskala horst block prior to the
discovery. These three wells, TK-201, MKL-1 and OTA-2, all had strong gas
shows. The first did not test the Triassic but was completed in the Jurassic
reservoir of the Toukimt field. The second produced gas but was abandoned
because of accompanying saltwater production (there are serious reservations
now that this was in fact formation water and the MKL-101 discovery well was
located at a higher structural position as a follow-up on these gas shows).
The third was prematurely abandoned due to the inability to control the high
pressure gas; gas in this well was encountered above the established Triassic
reservoir. The vertical interval containing the high pressure gas spans an
interval of approximately 1,450 m (700 m for the Triassic siltstone reservoir
only) of which 185 m are proven to date. While this is an unusally long
interval it is supported by the pressure data. Six direct pressure
measurements and five derived from mud weight requirements in five wells
(three wells prior to discovery plus MKL-101 and MKL-102) all fall on a common
gas gradient which extends well into the underlying Paleozoic. The linear
distance between the most distant of these wells is 25 km. All are located
on, or on the flank of, a high regional fault block (regional Meskala horst)



- 52 -                    ANNEX 2.1
Page 7 of 8
which covers an area of 300 km2 or more and has a vertical relief on the order
of 2,500 m. The crest of the regional Meskala horst appears to be relatively
flat, broken by small faults with a regional dip from north to south along its
axis. The seimic data at, or near, the productive Triassic interval is weak
and discontinuous but indicates the absence of local or discrete structure.
21.      The underlying Paleozoic rocks are also indicated by pressure
measurements to be gas bearing but no appreciable reservoir has been
encountered to date in this part of the geologic section. The dense Lower
Devonian limestones were tested in the MKL-102 in an open hole section of some
200 m (4,005-4,200 m) to test the possibility of production from fractures.
This test was reported to have produced water with a small quantity of gas.
How a formation with a gas pressure could produce water from a zone too tight
to produce gas remains an anomaly. This is further complicated by the fact
that the reputed formation water was analyzed as having the identical physical
and chemical properties of the load water. The results of this test should be
discounted as should the reported formation water from the Triassic in MKL-1
(para. 20).
22.      Based on average reservoir characteristics encountered to date, the
Triassic reservoir contains in-place reserves on the order of 33 BCF of gas
and 2.8 million barrels of condensate per square kilometer. Due to the
combination of poor reservoir quality and high liquid content the recoverable
fraction is expected to be relatively low and somewhat dependent on well
density, applicability of well stimulation and producing rate. Given the
unknown extent of the field and insufficient data on recoverability it is not
possible to estimate the magnitude of the economically producible reserves at
this time. The considerations favoring sizeable producible reserves are the
following; the area of expected high pressure gas is large, the gas column is
indicated to be long; and a sufficient reservoir may yet be found in the
Paleozoic. An improvement of the Triassic reservoir in some direction from
the discovery well would also make the discovery highly commercial. On the
other hand, if the reservoir deteriorates away from the discovery, or is
absent, the prospects for an economic development of Meskala would be
limited. The proposed program is designed to appraise the discovery and, at
the same time, explore other portions of the regional Meskala horst. It is
considered to be best suited to resolve these uncertainties and will provide
for an evaluation of the discovery and potential extensions in the shortest
time and least costly manner. Overall, the investment risk involved in the
exploration program is judged to be reasonable given the encouraging results
to date for an economic development of Meskala and the implications for
Morocco's future energy investment strategy.

Proposed Well Locations and Objectives
1.       General agreement has been reached with ONAREP as to the location of
the nine proposed wells and to the proposed depths, coring, logging, testing
and completion programs. A summary of the objectives of each well is as
follows:
MKL-105 - a Triassic reservoir appraisal well located 2 km west of
the MKL-1l discovery with secondary objectives in th Paleozoic Lower
Carboniferous section;
MKL-106 - a Triassic reservoir apraisal well located 2.5 km east-
southeast of the MKL-101 discovery with secondary objectives in the Paleozoic
Ordovician section;
ZEL-101 - an exploratory well to evaluate the Triassic reservoir, 16
km south-southeast of the MKL-101 discovery well (11 km south-southeast of
MKL-104 currently drilling) near the southeast margin of the Meskala horst
block with secondary objectives in the Paleozoic Ordovician or Cambrian
section;
GTO-101 - an exploratory well to evaluate the Triassic reservoir, 17
km north-west of the MKL-101 discovery well (7 km south of OTA-3 currently
drilling) near the west margin of the Meskala horst block with secondary
objectives in an as yet undetermined portion of the Paleozoic section;
ABK-1 - an exploratory well to evaluate the Triassic reservoir, 13 km
northwest of the MKL-101 discovery (9 km southeast of OTA-3 currently
drilling) in the north-central synclinal portion of the Meskala horst block
with secondary objectives in the Paleozoic Upper Carboniferous section;
GTE-101 - an exploratory well to evaluate the Triassic reservoir, 8
km northwest of the MKL-101 discovery well on the western margin of the
Meskala horst block with secondary objectives in an as yet undetermined
Paleozoic section;
MKL-107 - an extended Triassic reservoir appraisal well located ti
the north-northeast of the MKL-101 discovery well (even the general location
is dependent on the outcome of high resolution seismic survey but expected to
be at least 2 km from MKL-102) with secondary objectives in undetermined
Paleozoic, probably Carboniferous;
