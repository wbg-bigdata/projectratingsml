Pound Sterling rate. Since then it has been fixed against a "basket"
of currencies. As these currencies are floating, the US Dollar/Rupee
exchange rate is subject to change. Conversions in this report have
been made at US$l to Rs 8.40.

INDIA
IJTTAR PRADESH PUBLIC TUBEWELLS PROJECT
Staff Appraisal Report
I. BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.01      The State of Uttar Pradesh (UP), located in the northeastern part
of India, is well endowed with water resources. However, in spite of the rich
water resources, large public investments in surface and tubewell irrigation
as well as rapid private groundwater development, only about two-fifths of
the cropped area is irrigated. Consequently, the Government of Uttar Pradesh
(GOUP) has placed great emphasis on the acceleration of irrigation in recent
Five-Year Plans. Since groundwater is the quickest and most assured source of
irrigation, and the present statewide extraction is only about one-half of
the total resources, GOUP gives priority to groundwater development.
1.02      The Bank Group has been involved in the financing of both private
and public tubewells in UP. Private groundwater development in UP, financed
through the lines of credit to three Agricultural Refinance and Development
Corporation Projects (Cr. 540-IN, 1975; Cr. 715-IN, 1977; and Cr. 947-IN,
1979) are mostly shallow tubewells, each commands about 3 to 5 ha. Public
tubewells, each commands about 100 ha or more, are normally constructed in
areas where gravity irrigation is not feasible and where the potential for
construction of shallow tubewells is limited due to the deep aquifer. From
the equity point of view, public tubewells are desirable to overcome the
underutilization of groundwater resources in certain areas where fragmented
and small holdings make the cost of tubewells prohibitively high and thus
unattractive to small farmers. Results from a Farm Benefit Survey for the
Project Completion Report of the Uttar Pradesh Agricultural Credit (Credit
392-IN) showed that, even with great efforts to reach small farmers statewide,
about 66% of the borrowers for private tube wells were small farmers (below 3
ha) and 34% were medium and large farmers. However, 91% of the total holdings
in the state is below 3 ha. This implies that, proportionally, more medium
and large farmers in the state can afford to borrow for private tubewells than
small farmers. Furthermore, since proper spacing of private tubewells is
difficult to enforce, the increased use of public tubewells in groundwater
development, if properly constructed and managed, is desirable to prevent
excessive extraction of the groundwater resources.
1.03      To support these endeavors, the Bank Group financed the construc-
tion of 800 public tubewells in UP between 1961 and 1964 (Cr. 8-IN, US$6 M).
While the physical implementation of the construction program was satisfactory,
the post-project operation has fallen short of the expected agricultural and
economic benefits. The poor performance has been caused by (a) incomplete and
poorly constructed distribution systems which resulted in excessive losses of



-2-
water; (b) overly large command areas in relation to well capacity; (c) inade-
quate operation and maintenance which led to frequent breakdowns, delayed
repairs and interruptions of services; (d) uncertain delivery of water,
particularly to cultivators located distant from the outlets; and (e) inade-
quate power supply.
1.04      Problems facing public tubewells are partly due to inadequate
management and partly due to poor planning and design. Nevertheless, for
reasons described above (para 1.02), they remain attractive sources of irri-
gation. Furthermore, in comparison with the surface irrigation schemes,
they have a shorter gestation period and more flexibility in operation. The
Government of India (GOI) has requested IDA assistance to finance the con-
struction of about 500 public tubewells in UP. The proposed project would
introduce significant changes in technical design and operational stanclards
used in the construction and management of public tubewells. These new
stanclards are aimed at improving the utilization of groundwater resources
which so far has returns that are significantly below the potential.
Agriculture in India
1.05      India covers some 3.27 million km  of which 49% is cultivable and
about 15% irrigated. India's population of about 650 M is growing at an
annual rate of 1.9%. National income has grown at about 3.4% per annum
since 1960 and the per capita GNP reached US$150 in 1977. Although average
per capita income has increased, in general, there has been limited progress
in the improvement of the living standards of the urban and rural poor who
comprise some 330 M people with annual incomes below the poverty line of
US$75 per capita. Accordingly, GOI's development plans give priority to
alleviating poverty and creating employment, especially in rural areas.
1.06      Agriculture is the dominant sector of the Indian economy and con-
tributes about 45% of GNP. It engages about 70% of the labor force and pro-
vides the base for about 60% of India's exports. During the last decade,
GOI development plans have emphasized agriculture and sought to raise food-
grain production by increasing the use of fertilizers, plant protection
chemicals, and improved seed varieties. In support of this, GOI has modern-
ized and expanded its agricultural credit institutions and accelerated the
development of irrigation.
1.07      Despite these endeavors and the impressive results of the Green
Revolution in some areas such as the States of Punjab and Haryana, the annual
overall growth rate in foodgrain production over the last 15 years was only
about 2.3% or slightly above the population growth. Furthermore, India's
agriculture remains heavily dependent on the weather since only about 31%
of the net cultivated area is irrigated. Major factors in reducing this
dependence would be an expansion of the irrigated area and better use of
existing irrigation facilities.
Irrigation in India
1.08      Up to 1964/65, the irrigated area increased at a rate of only about
2.1% per year, of which approximately two-thirds was from surface water



- 3 -
resources and one-third from groundwater. Since then, the rate of increase
has about doubled, maimly through an accelerated program of groundwater devel-
opment. At present, tlae irrigated area is some 50 M ha, about three-fifths
of which is surface irrigated and two-fifths served by groundwater.
1.09      The pace of surface water development remained relatively constant
at about 0.5 M ha per year until the end of the Fourth Plan (1969/70-1973/74).
During this period, the physical plan targets set by GOI for a more rapid
development of surface irrigation were never fulfilled. A major problem was
the pressure, mainly political, in the States to start as a large number of
projects as possible. Because of limited financial resources, this policy
resulted in long construction periods for projects and delayed benefits. In
recent years, however, budgetary allocations have grown and the authorities
have made concerted efforts to complete ongoing projects. As a result, the
surface irrigation potential created in 1976/77 was 1.1 M ha, more than twice
that achieved in any single year before the start of the Fifth Plan in 1974/75.
1.10      Actual utilization in many completed irrigation projects remains
significantly lower than the potential created. Some reasons for this are:
(i) water losses from the distribution systems are significantly higher than
what is normally assumed when the irrigation potential is calculated; and
(ii) construction of watercourses and field channels below irrigation outlets
was left to farmers and often built to low standards. The Command Area Devel-
opment (CAD) programs, introduced in the early 1970s, attempted to improve
this situation by providing technical advice, organizational support, and
institutional finance to farmers in the command areas. Unfortunately, the
standards of water distribution still remained inadequate even under CAD
because costs of construction of watercourses and field channels are kept to
a minimum to encourage farmers to pay for these communal works. The vested
interests of farmers who, at present, benefit from inequitable water distri-
bution have also severely interfered with the CAD process. During recent
years, some States in India have adopted improved measures of irrigation
development, including: (i) construction of public irrigation systems down
to individual farms, or in the case of small holdings, as near as possible
to the farm; (ii) conveyance of water from the source to the farm outlet in
lined canals; and (iii) provision of controls in the system -- operated by
the project authority -- to enable a reliable and timely water supply to each
farm.
1.11      Groundwater development had been accelerated in the northwestern
part of India and in some States in the Deccan Plateau and in the South
(Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu). The potential created increased
from 0.5 M ha per year by the end of the Fourth Plan (1968/69-1973/74) to
1.1 M ha in 1977/78. At present, net groundwater extraction is about one-
half of the mean annual recharge. Levels of development vary widely
between States, from a small portion of recharge in Assam (5%) to as high
as 75% in Tamil Nadu. The bulk of future groundwater development will
occur in the Eastern Region where only about one-third of the ultimate
potential has been developed. Demand for tubewells is relatively strong
in this region. Of the 3.5 M ha of groundwater developed during the Fifth
Plan (1973-78), about 2.2 M ha, or 62%, were in the Eastern Region. The
growth rate of area irrigated by groundwater in the Eastern Region during
this period was 6.5% per annum compared with 3% in the rest of India.



- 4 -
1.12      Groundwater development through private tubewells is not subject
to most of the water efficiency problems encountered with major and medium
surface schemes. Storage is provided naturally; conveyance from well to
field is over short distances; water can be tapped and delivered to farmers'
fields quickly; and it is always timely, being under the complete control of
individual farmers. Even then, there is considerable scope for improvement,
particularly in the design and implementation standards for pumping equipment.
Public schemes for groundwater development, including augmentation tubewells
and direct irrigation tubewells, face similar problems as surface irrigation
systems. Public tubewells, however, are easier to manage due to smaller
command areas and more flexibility in irrigation delivery.
II. THE STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH
A. An Overview
General
2.01      The State of Uttar Pradesh (UP) is the most populated State in India.
It has a population of about 100 M (1979), accounting 2for 15% of total Indian
population, whereas its geographical area (298,000 km ) covers only 9% of the2
count:ry. The population density is thus extremely high at 340 persons per km
and about two-thirds of all farm holdings in UP are below one hectare, compared
to about 50% for the nation.
The Economy
2.02      The economy of UP is predominantly agrarian, with agriculture con-
tributing about 55% of the State income and employing about 78% of the working
force. Between 1960/61 and 1976/77, the rate of growth of the primary sector,
incluiding agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining was only 1.7% per annum
(p.a.) compared to an all-India average of 2.0%. Similarly, the secondary
sector, including manufacturing, construction, electricity, gas and water
supply, (15% of the State income) only grew at 2% p.a., which was half the
national rate of 4%. The performance of the tertiary sector, including
transport, trade, finance and services, (30% of the State income) fared better
at 4%, growth p.a. However, since tertiary sector activities started from a
relatively small base and were concentrated mostly in the urban areas, their
rapid growth only contributed marginally to the majority of population (85%)
living in the rural areas.
2.03      As a result of the poor performance of the primary and secondary
sectors, State income only grew at an annual rate of 2.2% p.a., well below
the national rate of 3.1%. Per capita income only increased by 0.5% p.a. and
was one of the lowest in India (Rs 870 in 1976/77 compared to the national
average of Rs 1,015). Since agriculture is the main activity in the State,
and it has close links to other sectors, economic progress is largely
dependent on the removal of constraints to further agricultural growth,
particularly through the expansion of irrigation.



-- 5
Employment and Rural Poverty
2.04      The labor force constitutes about 30.9% of the UP population.  Its
participation rate is significantly higher in rural areas (31.4%) than in
urban areas (27.7%). Cultivators and agricultural laborers account for 65.7%
and 22.8% of the rural labor force, respectively. Because of the slow growth
of agriculture and manufacturing, productive employment has failed to keep
pace with population growth. An attempt was made in 1978/79 to quantify the
unemployment rate as follows: 1/
No. of
Unemployed   % of Rural          % of Urban      % of Total
'000 jobs    Labor Force        Labor Force    Labor Force
Rural            2,381          9.0                  -             7.8
Urban              272           -                  6.6            0.9
Total          2,653          9.0                 6.6            8.7
2.05      The poor performance of the agricultural sector also resulted in a
sharp rise in the proportion of rural population living below the poverty line
(US$75 per capita per annum) from 41.6% in 1960/61 to 63.6% in 1970/71. 2/
According to the National Sample Survey in 1973/74, at least about two-thirds
of the rural population lived below the poverty level. Agricultural laborers
account for a substantial part of the poor. It is estimated that 90% of the
agricultural laborers in Uttar Pradesh lived below this poverty level. 2/
A series of programs have been created to raise standards of living of this
group, including measures to secure tenants rights, land redistribution and
public works program. These programs so far have been largely unsuccessful
due to faulty planning and poor implementation.
2.06      Public Services.  By most traditional indicators, UP is one of the
least advanced States in India. The literacy rate, 21.8%, is lower than the
national average of 30%.  The number of doctors and health centers per 1,000
persons is the lowest in India. Although the State is well connected to the
rest of India, through national highways, railways and airways, the intra-State
communication is inadequate. In 1975/76, the road length per 100 km2 was
only 24 kms compared to the national average of 36 kms. The provision of
safe, potable and adequate drinking water has been slow. At present, water
supply schemes are being implemented in about 20% of the villages with no
adequate source of drinking water. The Bank Group has supported GOUP in water
supply schemes through the ongoing Uttar Pradesh Water Supply and Sewerage
Project (Cr. 550-IN, US$40 M).

B. The Agricultural Sector
Climate
2.07      Uttar Pradesh has a tropical monsoon climate but there are great
variations in temperature in accord with changes in altitude. On the Gangetic
plain, the average temperature ranges from a minimum of 3-4 C in January to
a maximum of 43-45 C in May and June. The Himalayan region of the State is
much cooler with snowfalls from December through March, The mean annual
rainfall ranges from about 700 mm in the western part of the plain to about
1,200 mm in the east. It exceeds 1,800 mm in the Himalayan foothills (Map
No. 14641). About 87% of the rainfall occurs during the June-September period.
However, there are considerable variations in both amounts and distribution.
Variability is directly related to the mean annual precipitation; thus the
eastern part of the Gangetic plain is subject to the greatest variation (+30-
35% of mean annual rainfall). The times of onset and end of the monsoon are
uncertain and long dry spells may occur within the rainy season. Uncertainty
regarding amount and distribution of rainfall makes irrigation a pre-requisite
for successful crop production even during the monsoon season.
Topography and Regional Division
2.08      The State divides naturally in three physical regions; the Himalayas,
the Gangetic plain and the Central Indian Plateau. The Himalayan region is of
rugged topography with high mountains intersected by deep valleys. A large
proportion of the land is not suitable for agriculture. The Gangetic plain
is an area of subdued topography which slopes to the south east. This is the
most heavily populated and cultivated area of the State. The southern edge of
Uttar Pradesh rises on to the Central Indian Plateau. This is an area of low
hills and plateau lands; part of the region is unsuitable for agriculture due
to the undulating topography and thin soils. All the major rivers originate
in the Himalayas and flow south eastwards across the Gangetic plain in deeply
incised channels. Only some of the minor tributaries of the Yamuna River and
Ganges River originate in the Central Plateau.
2.09      For planning purposes, the State is divided into five regions:
the Hills comprising mainly the Himalayas; the Western region consisting of
a small strip of sub-Himalayas and the western part of the Gangetic plain;
the Central region covering the central Gangetic plain; the Eastern region
extending over the eastern part of the Gangetic plain; and the Budelkb.and
lying in the Central Indian Plateau.
Soils
2.10      A wide variety of soils occurs in different parts of the State
(Map 14640). The soils of the Himalayan region are generally thin, occur in
pockets or along valleys and are absent on steep slopes. They are usually
immature and exhibit many of the characteristics of the parent rocks. The
soils of the Gangetic plain are alluvial of different ages. The western part
of the plain is characterized by shallow loams and sandy loams. The west



central plain has thick, heavy loam soils while the central area and eastern
plain have loam or sandy loam soils. The soils of the Central Plateau region
categorize mainly into black or red varieties. The former are heavy and
calcareous occurring mainly on the valley floor. The red soils are light
and occur on the plateaux tops and on the upper slopes of hills. Thickness
of soil profile is variable and soils may be absent on steeper slopes. Some
areas of saline soils occur on the Gangetic plain but alkalinity is not a
common problem. Fertility levels are low to medium.
Land Use
2.11      About 18.2 M ha (61% of the reporting area for land utilization in
the State of 29.8 M ha) is under cultivation. The forest area of 5.1 M ha
(17%) is less that what is required to maintain a healthy ecological balance.
About 3.4 M ha (11%) are either barren, uncultivable or put to non-agricultural
use. Cultivable waste land accounts for 1.5 M ha (5%). The remaining 1.7 M
ha (6%) are either fallow or used as permanent pastures and groves. Since
1960/61, the net cultivated area has remained stagnant and there is little
scope for increasing it in the future.
Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.12      The average farm size in UP is 1.2 ha, but there are large varia-
tions from one region to another. As noted below, the farm size distibution
is largely determined by local agro-climatic conditions as well as population
density:
Annual   Population    % of Farms in Size Group (ha)   Average
Region         Rainfall   Density        0-1   1-3   3-5   5-10    10+        Size

2.13      The smallest average farm size is in the Eastern region, where rain-
fall is relatively high and the area is densely populated. In contrast, in
other high rainfall regions in the Hills and Bundelkhand, the average size of
holdings are larger, about 2.0 to 2.7 ha. This is due to sparse population,
difficult topography and infertile land.
2.14      A variety of land tenure arrangements exist.  In the early 1950s,
an Act was passed abolishing intermediate tenancy and providing security of
tenure to erstwhile tenants. In 1961, a second Act imposed a ceiling on rural
landholdings, with the specific aim of achieving greater equality in the land-
holdings of individual cultivators. However, the existence of legal loopholes,
coupled with ineffective enforcement, resulted in a complete failure of this
Act to achieve its objective. In 1971, the land reform issue was reopened,
but so far, has remained unresolved.



-8-
Crops and Cropping Patterns
2.15       Cropping intensity for the whole State (133%) has not changed since
1970/71.  The intensity is generally high in the Hills, Western and Eastern
regions and low in the Central and Bundelkhand (para 2.09). T>-e Hills have a
high cropping intensity (157%) due to high rainfall and adequa.e soil moisture.
Western UP is well provided with irrigation facilities and agricultural tech-
nology is better developed here than elsewhere in the State. Consequently,
the cropping intensity is as high as 140%. The high intensity in the eastern
UP plain (135%) is mainly in response to the high pressure of population on
cultivable land in the e areas.  These districts are densely populated, with
400-500 persons per km and a large majority of the population depends on
agriculture for its sustenance. The less developed state of agriculture in
the Central and Bundelkhand regions results in low cropping intensity (129%
and 109%, respectively).
2.16      Cereals -- paddy, maize, bajra and sorghum in the kharif season and
wheat and barley in the rabi season -- account for two-thirds of the cropped
area.  Pulse crops whiich occupy about 12% of the cropped land include pigeon
peas (ahhar), moong and moth in the kharif and gram, peas and masur in the
rab:i. Non-food crops are grown only on 22% of the crop land. Various types
of oilseeds occupy about 15% of the cropped land, followed by sugarcane (6%).
The remaining 1% is under miscellaneous crops such as fruits, vegetables,
fiber crops, green manure and condiments.
2.17      Cropping pattern varies with the changing conditions of physical
and social ecology in different parts of the State. In the Western region,
particularly in the upper Ganga-Yamuna Doab (Map 14641), sugarcane and forage
crops are the important crops in the kharif season. Bajra, maize and rice are
more dominant in the Central Region. Further east, with the increase in
precipitation, rice becomes the main crop. Maize and millets are important
crops during the kharif in the Hills Region and jowar in Bundelkhand. During
the rabi season, wheat occupies most of the land in all regions, followed by
gram and barley.
Agricultural Production Trends (Annex 1, Table T-1)
2.18      From the commencement of the First Five-Year Plan (1950/51), up
to 1977/78, foodgrains production only grew about 2% p.a., barely keeping pace
with the population growth. Rice and wheat production accounted for most of
this growth while coarse grains remained stagnant and pulse production de-
clined. The performance of non-food crops such as oilseeds, sugarcane and
potato fared better at 3.1%, 3.5% and 5.5% growth p.a., respectively. However,
since these crops only occupy a small portion of the total cropped area (para
2.16), their rapid rates of growth do not significantly affect the overall
performance of the agricultural sector.
2.19      The early years after Independence were characterized by both area
expansion and yield increases for most crops. Between 1950/51 and 1960/61,
production of foodgrains grew at a rate of 1.6% p.a. due to a 0.9% increase



- 9 -
in cropped area and a 0.7% increase in yields. Both rice and wheat produc-
tion, major cereals in the State, grew at respectable rates of 5.2% and 4.8%
p.a. respectively. In the sixties, the agricultural scene changed signifi-
cantly. Increases in production of most crops during this period were largely
the result of rising yields. Rice production, however, stagnated while wheat
production grew at a rate of 9.9% p.a. and maize 9.7% p.a. Whereas oilseeds
and sugarcane production only grew at 3.7% and 1.0% p.a., respectively, the
gain in potato production was spectacular. It grew at a rate 10% p.a., result-
ing from both area expansion (4.3% p.a.) and yield increases (5.6% p.a.). The
impressive performance of most crops, except rice and sugarcane, during this
period was largely due to the introduction of improved high yielding varieties
and accelerated develolpment of private tubewells in the latter part of the
sixties.
2.20      The agricultural transformation in rice crops seemed to lag a few
years behind wheat. From 1971/72 to 1977/78, rice production improved sig-
nificantly, growing at a rate of 4.7% p.a., slightly above wheat production
(4.1%). Areas under other major cereal crops such as maize and barley suffered
a major setback, and their production showed a declining trend. Cash crops
still performed well, growing at a rate of 4-5% p.a. Production of oilseeds
and sugarcane improved significantly, growing at 4.2% and 4.4% p.a., respec-
tively. Potato production maintained its earlier momentum, growing at a rate
of 9.5% p.a. Area expansion under this crop slowed down, however, to at a
rate of 1.6% p.a. compared to 4.3% during the sixties. Greater use of high
yielding potato seeds resulted in an overall yield increase of 8.0% p.a.
C. Irrigation and Power
Water Resources and Utilization
2.21      Surface Irrigation.  Uttar Pradesh lies within the catchments of
four great tributaries of the Ganges river system. These are, from west to
east, the Yamuna, Upper Ganga, Ghagara and Gandak Rivers. Most of the streams
which feed these rivers have their sources in the Himalayas, though right bank
feeders to the Yamuna and to Ganges below the confluence with the Yamuna ori-
ginate on the Central Plateau. The Himalayan streams are fed by both run-off
from monsoon rainfall and by snow-melt during the spring through fall period.
The streams originating on the plateau are fed only by monsoon run-off. The
river reaches within tlhe Gangetic plain are generally deeply incised into the
regional water table and function as a drainage line for groundwater. The
combination of run-off from snow-melt and groundwater drainage ensures peren-
nial flows in the main river courses. However, there is a marked range of
discharge rate between early spring (before the onset of snow-melt run-off)
and during the height of the monsoon. Though no proper survey has been under-
taken, it is estimated that the total water resource of the Ganges basin is
about 510,000 Mm per annum. Approximately 70% of this passes through
Uttar Pradesh. The ultimate irrigation potential 1/ in UP is estimated at
1/   This is expressed in terms of gross irrigated area.



-10 -
12.4 M ha. At present about 6.2 M or 50% of the resources available to the
State has been utilized. Thus, there is ample scope for further development.
2.22      Groundwater.  The Gangetic plain is underlain by a rich aquifer
system formed of alluvial deposits. The alluvial deposits form a single
though heterogeneous, aquifer system which exceeds 1,000 meters in thickness
in some parts of the plain. Aquifers are formed by beds of sand which inter-
finger with beds of silt, clay and kankar. The aquifer system is recharged
mainly by infiltration of rain falling on the area or collected by local
run--off into pools and lakes. Another important source of recharge is deep
percolation of canal and on-field losses from surface water irrigation sys-
tems. Parts of the plain are subject to flooding by river water in some years
and infiltration of flood water forms an important source of recharge in such
areas. Discharge is by seepage to the main natural drains which are deeply
incised and form line-sinks for groundwater drainage, evaporation from shallow
water tables and extraction by wells. Underflow under the regional hydraulic
gracdient forms a relatively small part of the water balance.
2.23      The State Groundwater Directorate (SGD) of the Ministry of i;rriga-
tioII in UP has estimated a mean annual net recharge availble to the State at
58,000 Mm . 3Net extraction by various types of tubewells and dugwells amounted
to 29,000 Mm in 1976/77 or about 50% of the groundwater resources. Thus,
the prospect for further groundwater development.in UP is good and demands
for tubewell water appear to be strong.
General Trends in Irrigation Development
2.24      The State is well endowed with water resources.  Nevertheless, only
about 8.3 M ha or 46% of the total net cultivated area of 18.2 M ha was irri-
gated in 1976/77. Between 1950/51 and the onset of the Green Revolution,
surface and groundwater development contributed equally to the expansion of
irrigated areas in UP. However, since 1965/66, groundwater development has
accounted for virtually all the increase in net irrigated area. In 1976/77,
about 4.8 M ha, or 58% of the total net irrigated area, was supplied with
groundwater, compared to 34% provided by the surface irrigation schemes. The
remaining 8% is served by storage tanks or by pump lift schemes of varying
scales. Progress of irrigation development in terms of net irrigated area in
the State since 1950/51 is shown below.

-11 -
2.25      The significant increase in areas irrigated by tubewells after
1965/66 was mainly due! to private groundwater development. Tubewells also
replaced many traditional dugwells. This stemmed from the introduction of
high yielding varieties (HYV) which required higher and more reliable water
supply and the increasing availability of rural electrification. However,
most of the private groundwater development during the Green Revolution period
occurred in the western part of the State where farmers were more progressive
and familiar with irrigation provided by surface canals. At present there
are about one million private tubewells and about 15,000 public tubewells in
operation in the State. GOUP plans to accelerate the development of both
sectors at rates of 100,000 private tubewells and 1,000 to 1,500 public tube-
wells per annum. Progress of development of private and public tubewells
since 1960/61 is illustrated below:

Power Supply and Demand
2.27      Present Situation.  The State of Uttar Pradesh is well endowed with
natural resources for generating power.  The Himalayan rivers in the northern
region of the State have a hydro-power potential in the order of 20,000 MW
and the recently developed Singrauli coal fields in the southern part can offer
a thermal power potential of about 10,000 MW. Due to the lack of financial



- 12 -
resources, the State has only installed about 2,982 MW of which about one-
third is provided by hydel schemes and the balance by thermal stations. The
ener,gy is transmitted through 31,000 km of main transmission and sub-
transmission lines of 33 to 400 KV. There is, in addition, an extensive 11
KV network dispersed throughout the State.
2.28      Per capita generation of electricity was about 100 Kwh in 1976/77
compared to an all-India average of 144 Kwh. Per capita consumption of elec-
tricity rose from 7 Kwh at the commencement of the First Five-Year Plan (1951)
to 86 Kwh by 1976/77. This still lagged behind the national average of 119
Kwh per capita. Agriculture accounts for about 30% of the total consumption.
The progress of rural electrification has been slow and presently only about
one-third of the villages has electric power. To assist GOUP in its drive to
increase the standard of living of the rural population, the Bank Group is
supporting rural electrification in UP through a line of credit to the Rural
Electrification Corporation.
2.29      Future Situation.  Under the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1978-83), an
additional plan for 2,394 MW has been approved and is under construction. If
the targets of the plan are achieved, the total installed capacity in 1983
would be 5,376 MW. Improvement of the transmission in accord with the addi-
tional generation capacity is also planned. This would increase the total
length of main transmission (132-440 kV) by 10,581 km and of sub-transmission
(37.5/33-66 KV) by 15,160 km. This would bring the total length of transmis-
sion in the above capacities range to about 56,700 km by 1983. The Bank Group
has participated in augmenting power supply in UP through the First Singrauli
Thermal Power Project (Cr. 685-IN) and the second project is being negotiated.
2.30      The power supply and distribution should be relatively satisfactory
if the targets of the Sixth Plan are achieved. However, given historic growth
rates and the latent demand for energy, it may not be possible to avoid some
rostering during peak demand periods for years to come.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
General
3.01      The tubewell irrigation systems to be constructed under the project
will be distributed in 12 administrative districts out of the 56 districts
which comprise the State of Uttar Pradesh (Map 14639). In general terms, the
districts are distributed about equally in the western, central and eastern
parts of the State and the number of system units are similarly divided.

Ghazipur                  40
Allahabad                 45
3.02      The selected districts are therefore representative of the range of
climate and agronomic c:onditions found on the Gangetic plain of Uttar Pradesh.
Rural population density ranges from 280 to 600 persons per km2, the lowest
densities occurring in the northern and western parts of the State and the
highest in the east.
Topography, Soils and Climate
3.03      The project area lies within the Gangetic plain which slopes to
the southeast (para 2.08). The topography is gently graded and of low relief.
The 12 districts are intersected by natural drainage ways which are meandering
and widely spread. The soils are light in texture, varying from silty loams
to sandy loams.
3.04      Climatological data for the 12 districts is given in Annex 1, Table
T-2. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 700 mm per annum in the southwestern
districts to 1,200 mm in some of the eastern districts. About 85-90% of the
rain occurs in the kharif season (June-September). Rainfall variability is
much higher in the eastern districts (30-35%) than in western districts
(20-25%). These factors make irrigation necessary for stable yields in the
kharif and imperative for successful crop growth in the rabi season (October-
May). Temperature patterns are similar throughout the project area with mean
monthly maxima at 20-23 C in January and 39-42°C in May.
Groundwater Resources
3.05      In all districts, the rich aquifers are formed by sand beds con-
tained within the Gangetic plain alluvial sequence. Groundwater balances
based on data provided by the SGD are summarized in Annex 1, Table T-3. These
balances, which are regarded as conservative estimates, indicate that the
water consumption by the project expressed as a proportion of the unexploited
groundwater resource inL each district ranges from 0.7 to 3.7%. Thus, at
district level, project requirements of groundwater resources would be more
than covered.



- 14 -
3.06      Most of the water contained by the alluvial aquifer system has less
than 1,000 parts per million (ppm) dissolved solids. There are considerable
areas of better quality water with dissolved solids fallings as low as 250
ppm. A few pockets of water with high chloride concentrations (in excess of
250 ppm CO) o, ur in Aligarh, Mainpuri and Saharanpur, but their localities
are fairly well defined and will be avoided for project wells.
Land Holdings and Land Tenure
3.07      The average farm size in the project area is about 1.1 ha, slightly
smaller than the State average of 1.2 ha. In districts located in the Western
Region, the average farm size is about 1.3 ha. Small holdings below 2 ha
account for 80% of the number but only about 40% of the total area. Average
size of holdings is smaller in districts of the Central and Eastern regions,
1.2 ha and 1.0 ha, respectively. About 85% of the total holdings are below 2
ha, accounting for one-half of the total area in the Central region, whereas
in the Eastern region, the percentages are 90% and 50%.
Agricultural Situation
3.08      The State is divided into nine major crop zones.  These crop zones
are identified by the crop proportion in the total cropped area in the State.
The project area falls into five major crop zones: (a) wheat, sugarcane, forage
maize; (b) wheat, bajra, maize; (c) wheat, rice, gram; (d) rice, wheat, gram,
barley and (e) rice, barley, wheat. The average cropping intensity,is about
133%, varying from 129% in the Eastern region to 131% and 140% in the Central
and Western regions, respectively. There is a wide variation in irrigation
intensity. About 60% of the total cropped area is irrigated in the Western
region whereas only one-third is under irrigation in the Central and Eastern
regions.
3.09      Crop yields also differ among the districts.  In general, for most
major crops such as wheat, rice, maize, barley and sugarcane, yields are much
higher in the Western region as illustrated below:
Average Yield (t/ha)
Region               Wheat   Rice   Maize   Barley   Sugarcane
Western               1.58   1.11    0.84    1.24         43.64
Central               1.30   0.94    0.72    1.09         33.62
Eastern               1.23   0.82    0.52    1.13         35.18
State                 1.36   0.93    0.73    1.14         40.50
3.10      Regional contrasts can also be demonstrated by the past performance
of different regions in respect of production and yields of total foodtgrains
from 1950/51 to 1975/76:

IV. PERFORMANCE OF PUBLIC TUBEWELLS
General
4.01      The public tubewells program in UP was initiated in 1931/32.  At the
beginning of the First Five-Year Plan (1950), some 2,000 public tubewells were
in service, increasing to 10,000 by 1970. At present, about 15,000 public
tubewells are in operation. They are distributed in all administrative divi-
sions on the Gangetic plain within Uttar Pradesh. During the Sixth Five-Year
Plan (1978-83), GOUP plans to construct about 1,000 to 1,500 new tubewells per
year. In general, public tubewells are installed in areas not commanded by
surface irrigation schemes and where the water table is too deep for the cen-
trifugal pumps commonly used for private wells or in backward areas where
private development is unlikely to take place within a reasonable time.
Although investments in public tubewells are socially attractive and generally
viable, poor utilization of these facilities has become a matter of concern
in recent years.
Past Performance
4.02      The number of operating hours and irrigated areas serve as useful
indicators of the performance of public tubewells. Statistics on the state-
wide performance of public tubewells are summarized for the years 1966/67
(the earliest year for which records were available) through 1978/79 in Annex
1, Table T-4. Though there have been some fluctuations in annual utilization
which is related to high or low rainfall years, the general trend has been for
a decrease both in hours of operation and area irrigated per tubewell. In
1966/67, the average hours of utilization was 3,355 per well and this was
exceeded in only one year in the recent record (3,457 hours in 1968/69).
In 1978/79, the average utilization was 1,508 hours per well with a range of
634 to 2,557 hours. Average irrigated area per tubewell fell from 150 ha in
1966/67 to 65 ha in 1978/79. Thus, though the number of tubewells increased
from 8,401 to 14,772 during the tabulated record period (an increase of 76%),
the total area irrigated by public tubewells systems decreased from 1.28 mil-
lion ha to 0.96 million ha (a fall of 26%).
4.03      Outstanding among the reasons for poor performance of existing
public tubewells are:



- 16 -
(a) the water conveyance systems are incomplete. Water is
presently supplied through 1.0 to 1.5 km of brick-lined
channel and 2 km of earth channel in a command area
of about 150 to 200 ha. These channels, built by the
Government, are poorly constructed and maintained.
Consequently, there are excessive water losses in the
system. There are also no control structures at the out-
lets. Farmers are expected to construct their own channels
to lead water from the formal distribution system to
their own fields. However, there are no effective orga-
nizations to help farmers with the design and imple-
mentation of these works. Furthermore, there are no
right-of-way rules to allow farmers located at a distant
from the formal distribution system to take water through
fields of farmers located near the outlet;
(b) the power supply has not met increasing demand. Rationing
of power is in effect and posted a fortnight in advance.
However, unscheduled short outages and voltage drops
occur frequently due to overloading of feeder lines;
(c) water allocation procedures are inadequate. The Ziledar
(Revenue Officer) works out a rotational schedule for
groups of farmers, particularly in the peak demand
periods. Irrigation is rotated among farmers belonging
to a thok. However, the group is formed arbitrarily
without consideration to the command of an outlet.
The thokdar (leader of a thok) would distribute water
among farmers belonging to the group in an arbitrary
manner. In some cases, the tubewell operator would
decide on the water allocation depending on his judge-
ment of water requirement on farmers' fields. Be-
cause of the disorganized water allocation, coupled
with unreliable power supply, the designed rotational
schedules are not observed. Consequently, irrigation
deliveries are unreliable and inequitable;
(d) delay in repair of unserviceable motors. The divisional
workshops do not carry sufficient spares. This, coupled
with inadequate communication and poor transportation
facilities, delays bringing a system back into operation
within a reasonable period; and
(e) each tubewell is operated by a tubewell operator, who
must be present to start the pump when power is available
and water is required. The required level of coordination
is often absent, particularly during the off-peak night
hours when power is more readily available.
Project Formulation and Objectives
4.04      Review of the existing situation with regard to public tubewell
systems revealed that several of the constraints on better utilization of



- 17 -
the facilities could be relieved by a change in technical and operational
standards. The improvements to be introduced under the project are aimed at:
(a) reducing water losses to a minimum by conveying water in
underground pipes to outlet valves commanding about 3 to 5 ha;
(b) providing facilities to protect pumps and motor from fre-
quent electrical breakdowns;
(c) providing facilities for automatic operation of the system
and thus increasing the security of water supply to individ-
ual cultivators (except when power is not available);
(d) improving water allocation procedures to ensure reliable
water supply to each individual cultivator through better
organization of operational staff and farmers' groups;
(e) providing facilities for better preventative maintenance
and emergency repairs of the water points; and
(f) speedy construction of each tubewell system (about 6 months
compared to 2 years at present) which would be feasible by
minimizing land acquisition problems.
4.05      The project introduces several innovations to the design and opera-
tion of public tubewell systems. The relative effectiveness of the proposed
changes have been established, a priori, based on theoretical calculations.
However, there is only limited experience of field operations and, thus, the
proposed changes have not yet been fully evaluated based on actual performance
data. For these reasons, a relatively limited project, in terms of the number
of facilities to be constructed, has been formulated. The project would be
executed by the Tubewell Wing of the Irrigation Department (para 6.01).
During a two year period (1980-82) 500 tubewell systems would be constructed
and operated in 12 selected districts of the State. Monitoring, evaluation
and training would be essential for achieving project objectives.
4.06      During the course of project preparation, with the assistance of
the FAO/CP staff, GOUP constructed three experimental tubewells to test
variols design improvements. The capacity of each tubewell was about
150 m /h, serving a cultivable command area of about 120 ha. The conveyance
system was either unlined, lined channels or PVC or concrete pipes, and was
extended to 3-5 ha outlets. Two tubewells were in operation in kharif 1979
(June-September). At the time of appraisal, preliminary results show that:
(a) water losses are considerably less in experimental
tubewells than existing tubewells located in areas
with similar agro-climatic characteristics;
(b) the proportion of the command area that is irrigated
is about twice as much in the experimental tubewells
than in existing tubewells; and



- 18 s
(c) the PVC pipes proved to be less susceptible to leaks,
easier to convey and the cost per tubewell is slightly
less than for concrete pipes.
Data on the performance of experimental and existing "control" tubewells is
presented in Annex 1, Table T-5. The heavy power rostering, resulting from
the exceptionally severe drought in kharif 1979, should be taken into account
in assessing the actual utilization of tubewell systems.
V. THE PROJECT
Project Components
5.01      The proposed project would finance:
(a)  construction of, over a two year period, 500 tubewells
equipped with electric motor driven turbine pumps:
(b)  vehicles, workshop equipment and monitoring equipment
to be used by the construction, operation and main-
tenance staff;
(c)  monitoring and evaluation studies;
(d)  staff training; and
(e)  funds for preparing future tubewell projects.
Description of a Tubewell System
5.02      Most of the water points constructed for public tubewell irrigation
systems in Uttar Pradesh over the past 50 years have been designed for dis-
charges of 150 m /h. An innovation of the p5oject is to increase the design
discharge of ssme tubewells to 225 and 300 m /h. Moreover, the command
areas of 150 m /h water points is to be decreased from the present norms of
150-200 ha to 75-100 ha.  The same ratio between the size of discharge and
the command area would be applied to water points of 225 and 330 m /h capa-
cities. This is aimed at changing the present concept of extensive irrigation
as a protection against drought to intensive irrigation to meet the demand of
improved agricultural technology. The life of each tubewell is expected to
last about 20 to 30 years
5.03      The Water Point.  The water point would consist of the well, pump,
prime mover, switch gear, starter and protection relays and electrical
power supply. The unit would be housed in a brick-built pump house. The
wells would range in depth from 100 to 260 m and be fitted with electric
turbine pumps. All pumps would have foot valves to prevent the possibility
of reverse flow causing motors to spin backward when power cuts occur.
5.04      Other changes from the currently standard design of water points
involve the switch gear, starter relays and ancillary electrical equipment.
These include:



- 19 -
(a) fitting level operated switches at the regulating tank
(para 5.05) to permit automation of the controls of
the prime mover which obviates the necessity for
a pump operator to be present to start the pumps;
(b) provision of a capacitor in the electrical system
to protect the motor against voltage fluctuations;
(c) provision of a single phase preventer in the starter
relay for motor protection;
(d) fitting of electronic hour meters on all pumping
units to facilitate monitoring of operation of the
pumps. About 20 of the water points would be equipped
with graphic recorders to monitor actual time and
duration of operation. Monitoring devices would also
be installed to record the availability of power
supply in the 11 kV line.
5.05      Regulating Tank.  An essential feature of the proposed system would
be the elevated regulating tank with about 10 minutes of storage capacity.
It would have the following functions:
(a) maintaining the operating head in the piped distribution
system;
(b) permitting automation of the pumping unit by means of
level operated switches which activate according to the
level in the tank responding to water use from the dis-
tribution system;
(c) permitting the distribution system to be operated at less
than the discharge rate of the pump without spillage by
means of the level operated switches and float valves; and
(d) ensuring equal division of the water into two, three or
four streams depending on the 3design capacity of the
water point (150,225 or 300 m /h).
5.06      Distribution Chamber.  Elevated distribution chambers would be
fitted on about 10% 1/ of the tubewells constructed under the project as alter-
natives to the regulating tanks. The purpose of including the distribution
chamber is to test the cost effectiveness and practicality of the regulating
tank (para 5.05). The chamber would maintain head in the piped distribution
system and would ensure equal division of the water to two to four streams by
a system of V notches. It would not be equipped with no-float switches for
automatic operation of the pumping unit and therefore cannot prevent spillage
if only part of the discharge from the pump is being used. Thus, attendance
of the pump operator would be necessary.
1/   This proportion may be changed pending on monitoring results and field
observations during project implementation.



- 20 -
5.07      Piped Distribution System.  The piped conveyance would consist of
concrete/PVC feeder pipes from the regulating tank or distribution chamber
to closed loops of PVC pipe. Thus, any distribution outlet on a loop may be
simultaneously supplied with water flowing from two directions which reduces
flow velociti s and head losses. Each loop would serre an area of 37-50 ha.
Thus, a 150 3m /h system would have two loops, a 225 m /ha system - 3 loops,
and a 300 m /ha system - 4 loops. The regulating tank or distribution
chamber would ensure equal division of the pump discharge to each feedeS
pipe and its pipe loop. The discharge to each loop would be about 75 m /h.
5.08      Distribution Outlets.  Alfalfa type valves would be provided as out-
lets to areas of 3-5 ha on each of the loop sub-systems. Thus, each loop
sub-system would have 10 to 15 outlets and each outlet would typically
serve about 5 farmers. Only one outlet on elch loop would be operated at
any time, thus providing a discharge of 75 m /h to the outlet command.
5.09      Earth Channels.  A properly designed and laid out earth channel
conveyance system would be constructed to deliver water from the outlet dis-
tribution boxes to the individual plots within the outlet command.
Planning Criteria
5.10      Selection of Sites.  The tubewell irrigation command areas will be
selected where:
(a) the construction of private tubewells is difficult
because of the drilling depth necessary to achieve
a satisfactory yield (greater than 45 m); and/or
(b) areas are economically backward and private well con-
struction is very slow to develop.
In aLll cases:
(c) there is sufficient unirrigated land in a particular
location, and sufficient demand for public tubewell
water to ensure that a cluster of at least 15 wells
will be drilled within a 2-3 year period;
(d) the groundwater and soil is of suitable
quality;
(e) the area is not submerged during heavy floods;
(f) there are no other public sources of irrigation
supply; and furthermore;
(g) priority is given to those areas in which land
consolidation has been carried out.
5.11      Survey and Design.  The preliminary works for the design and con-
struction of a tubewell irrigation system will include:



-- 21 -
(a)  the preparation of a contour map with 30 cm intervals
which will be superimposed on the 1:4,000 scale
village cadastral maps;
(b)  a semi-detailed soil survey of the proposed command
area to establish the irrigability class; and
(c)  a detailed design will be prepared for each tubewell
irrigation system at scale 1:4,000.
Design Criteria
5.12      Wells (Annex 1, C-1).  The wells will be drilled using either direct
rotary or reverse circulation drilling rigs. Drilling diameters will be 500-
600 mm and total depths of wells will be in the range of 100 to 260 meters
according to the design discharge and the following schedule:

5.13      Well casing and screen will be of mild steel.  The pump chamber
casing will be of 350 mm oiter diameter (OD) in the case of wells with design
dischargss of 150 or 225 m /h and 400 mm OD for wells with design discharge
of 300 m /h. The average length of the pump chamber will be 40 meters.
The production string will be of 200 mm diameter and will consist of slotted
pipe covering aquifer material and blank pipe covering non-produc ive beds.
Average lengths of pSoduction string will be 100 meterS for 150 m /ha wells,
160 meters for 225 m /h wells and 220 meters for 300 m /h wells. The
well will be gravel packed.
5.14      The wells will be initially developed using a compressor, and
finally developed with a diesel driven vertical shaft turbine pumping unit
of capacity at least 50% higher than the design discharge. The wells will
be test pumped for 24 hours, the first half of period being in the form of a
step-draw-down test in four steps, the final discharge rate will then be
maintained for the balance of the test pumping period.
5.15      Pumping Units.  The pumps will be mainly electric submersible type.
Vertical shaft turbine pumps may be installed in areas where they may be tech-
nically more appropriate. The starter relay will be of Star Delta type for
motors of less than 30 HP capacity and of Auto Transformer Starter (ATS) type
for motors of 30 HP or greater. A single phase preventer will be included in
the relay. The switch gear will be automated through a level operated control
at the regulating tank. A capacitor will be provided for power factor correc-
tion and current regulation. An electronic hour meter will be fitted to
monitor the operation of the pump.

5.16      Power Transmission and Transformation.  The 11 kv line will lbe
mounted on reinforced concrete posts. An 11/0.4 kva transformer of appro-
priate capacity will be provided for each water point.
5.17      Pumr -quse.  The pumphouse will be a brick-built structure and will
be fitted with an I girder support for chain pulleys to facilitate removal of
the pump for maintenance.
5.18      Regulating Tank (Annex 1, C-2).  The regulating tank will be a rein-
forced brick and concrete structure, elevated on pillars and providing about
10 minutes of storage against the discharge of the pump. It will be equipped
with float valves and will maintain a maximum head of about 5 meters at the
intake to the piped distribution.
5.19      Distribution Chamber.  This will be a brick-built structure which
will maintain a head of about 5 meters at the intake to the piped distribution
system. It will also ensure equal division of the discharge from the pump
unit to each sub-system of the piped distribution by a system of V notches.
5.20      Distribution System (Annex 1, C-3).  The main distribution will be
in buried pipes. Concrete feeder pipes of 30 cm diameter or PVC pipes of 20 cm
will convey the water from the regulating tank or distribution chamber to PVC
distribution pipes of 15 cm diameter. So far as possible, the PVC pipes will
be laid in closed loops to reduce friction losses and maintain the same dis-
charge at each outlet.  Each loop will serve an area of 37-50 ha.  Average
lengths of conveyance of each of the planned water point discharge capacities
are:

5.21      Distribution System Outlets.  The pipe outlets will be alfalfa type
valves which will be located to provide gravity command to areas of 3-4 ha,
the limits of which will be defined by plot boundaries. The valves will be
sized to deliver 75 m /h under the prevailing head and will discharge to
outlet boxes which will be gated to deliver water in several directions. The
most distant plot in an outlet command will not be greater than 150 m from
the outlet.
5.22      Other Distribution Elements.  Other elements of the piped distri-
bution system include standpipes (about 2 to 3 per loop), properly designed
and laid out earth channels to convey water from the valve outlets to the
plots.  Average lengths of earth conveyanse for each of the planned3water
point capacities ari about 6 km for 150 m /h system, 9 km for 225 m /h
and 12 km for 300 m /h.

5.23      Roads.  A low cost, unsurfaced access and service track will be
provided from the nearest government road to the water point.
Operation and Maintenance Criteria
5.24      The following are the main criteria for operation of the irrigation
system:
(a)  water will be allocated according to the size of the
landholdings within the tubewell command;
(b)  the outlet command area will be the unit by which water
deliveries are scheduled and quantities delivered will
be defined by the size of the command area;
(c)  only one outlet on a loop sub-system will be open at any
one time, thus fixing the rate of flow and permitting
the quantity delivered to be defined on a time basis;
(d)  a rotational system between outlets will be designed by
the Junior Engineer in charge of the tubewell; and
(e)  the farmer group within each outlet command will, with
the assistance of the Junior Engineer, organize water
allocation within the command according to the size of
the landholding of each farmer.
5.25      The main criteria for emergency and preventative maintenance are:
(a)  each tubewell cluster of about 20 wells under a Junior
Engineer will have the continuous services of a skilled
mechanic plus helpers who will tour the water points for
emergency maintenance;
(b)  each Operation and Maintenance Division (para 6.02) will
have a properly equipped workshop for maintenance of
pumps, prime movers and switch gear, plus adequate
transport according to the following schedule:

indicate wear; and



- 24 -
(e) well discharges and drawdown will be checked half yearly
and the well will be rehabilitated if the discharge-drawdown
relationship indicates deterioration of well performance.
5.26      Agreements have been reached with GOUP that:  (a) it -,-uld select
command areas, as well as design, construct, operate and maintain project
tubewells according to these criteria; and (b) it would cause the State
Electricity Board to energize the tubewell pump units within two months
after the completion of the piped distribution system.
Project Costs
5.27      Total project costs are estimated to be US$37.7 million equivalent,
including US$1.7 million in taxes and duties. The foreign exchange component
would be US$2.2 million or equivalent to about 6% of the total project cost.
Estimated costs are based on price levels prevailing in September 1979.
Physical contingencies on civil works averaging about 8% of the base cost have
been included. Expected price increases are taken as 16% in 1979/80, 10% in
1980/81 and 7% in 1981/82. Project costs are detailed in Annex 1, Tables T-6
to T-i12 and are summarized below.

Financing
5.28      The proposed credit of US$18 M would finance 50% of the total
project costs net of taxes and duties, including all foreign exchange costs
and about 45% of local costs. The balance would be contributed by GOUP, which
would include a GOI contribution. An agreement has been reached with GOI
that it would miake the proceeds of the credit available to GOUP on GOI's
standard terms and arrangements for development assistance to the states.
An agreement has been reached with GOUP that it would promptly provide funds
to execute the project in accordance with the implementation and expenditure
schedule for the two-year project period (Annex 1, C-4).
5.29      In order to ensure meaningful and reliable monitoring results at
the end of the project period, a number of tubewells should be completed in
the first three month period of the project and be ready for operation. The
construction of tubewells would be seasonal (para 5.31) and it would be
advantageous to drill tubewells and to install the pipes during the dry
season. For this reason, retroactive financing would be provided from
September 15, 1979 which is after the date of appraisal to the date of credit
signing for (a) works completed in the construction of tubewells and (b)
vehicles required for staff to carry out field operations. The amount of
retroactive financing is not expected to exceed US$1.0 M.
Procurement
5.30      Civil works would consist of drilling of bore holes and construction
of well distribution systems, access roads and buildings (i.e., pump houses,
workshops and storage facilities, and quarters for operations and maintenance
staff). Drilling (US$3.7 million 1/) would be carried out by the Tubewell
Wing, which has an established, technically competent staff capable of
drilling the 1,500 wells in its annual program, of which IDA-financed wells
would form only a part. The remaining civil works (US$4.3 million 1/) would
be small and scattered and thus unsuitable for international bidding. These
works would be carried out by local contractors selected after competitive
bidding, according to procedures satisfactory to the Association, with
materials provided by the State Government.
5.31      PVC and steel casing pipes valued at US$11.8 million 2/ would be
required for project wells and the associated distribution systems. These
materials would be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB),
with the exception of an initial supply of up to US$2 million worth of PVC
pipes, which would be procured through the State's usual local procurement
procedures in order to permit an early start on the first year's well con-
struaction program. Remaining building materials (e.g., steel bars, bricks

2/   Net of taxes and price contingencies.



- 27 -
concrete, cement, timber; totalling US$3.8 million 1/ would be required in
small amounts throughout the project area and would be unsuitable for inter-
national procurement. These materials would be procured through local
competitive procedures, which are satisfactory to the Association. In
view of the need to maintain an adequate supply of spare parts throughout the
project area, pumpsets and accessories (US$1.8 million) would also be procured
locally on the basis of competitive bidding. Field vehicles (US$0.8 million)
would be purchased in small quantities over a period of two years and would
be widely dispersed over the project area. As adequate maintenance of these
vehicles would require a good network of servicing and spare parts facilities,
these vehicles would be procured through local competitive bidding according
to existing Government procedures. Finally, monitoring equipment (US$40,000)
would be purchased in small orders of US$3,000 or less by prudent shopping
through normal trade channels.
Disbursements
5.32      Disbursements under the credit would be made against (i) 100% of
foreign costs or 70% of local expenditures for monitoring equipment; (ii) 100%
of ex-factory costs or 70% of expenditures on locally procured vehicles;
(iii) 100% of expenditures on training; and (iv) 50% of expenditures incurred
on completed tubewells. Disbursement for completed tubewells would be made
against certificate of expenditures submitted by GOUP, itemized by major
components. The disbursement request would also include a certified statement
by the Superintendent Engineer in charge that (i) all works on the tubewell
have been completed in accordance with the agreed planning and design criteria;
(ii) the command area of each tubewell is proportional to the discharge during
the drawdown test; (iii) the discharge of each tubewell is not less than 70%
of the design discharge; and (iv) the tubewell has been electrified. Dis-
bursement for training and for payments of less than Rs 150,000 for equipment
and vehicles would also be made against certificate of expenditures submitted
by GOUP. Documentation of these works would be retained by GOUP and made
available for inspection by IDA during project review mission. The estimated
schedule of expenditure, the proposed allocation of the proceeds of the credit
and the semi-annual disbursement schedule are presented in Annex 1, Table T-13
to T-15. It is expected that disbursements would be completed by December
1982.
Accounts and Audits
5.33      The Tubewell Wing of the Irrigation Department (para 6.01) would be
subject to normal Government control and auditing procedures which are satis-
factory to IDA. Agreements have been reached with GOUP that: (i) it would
maintain separate accounts on project expenditures; (ii) these accounts would
be audited by the State auditor; (iii) audit summaries would be submitted to
IDA nine months after the close of the fiscal year together with the auditor's
reports; and (iv) it would make available complete accounts and financial
statements to IDA during supervision mission.

VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
The Tubewell Wing of the Irrigation Department
6.01      Existing Structures (Annex 1, C-5).  Construction, operation and
maintenance of public tubewells are the responsibility of the Tubewell
Wing (TW) of the Irrigation Department. The TW is directly managed
by two Additional Chief Engineers with responsibility for Eastern (including
the Central region) and Western Uttar Pradesh. The TW is sub-divided into
14 Circles, each covering several administrative districts and controlled by
a Superintendent Engineer. Each Circle includes 4 to 6 Divisions under
Executive Engineers. One Division is responsible for workshops and stores,
one for drilling of tubewells and the remaining Divisions for the construction
of pump houses and distribution systems, installation of pumping equipment and
operation and maintenance of the tubewell systems. Divisions are further
divided into 4 Sub-divisions under Assistant Engineers. Each Sub-division
comprises about 3 to 4 Sections, headed by Junior Engineers (JE). Under the
charge of each JE, there are Tubewell Operators (one per tubewell) and/or
Mechanics (one for 15 to 20 tubewells). In general, a Section is responsible
for O&M of 30 to 40 tubewells, a Sub-division 100 to 125; and a Division for
about 400 to 500 tubewells.
6.02      Proposed Organization (Annex 1, C-5).  To construct and operate the
500 project tubewells, two Circles within the existing TW would be responsible
for implementing the project. In view of the greater amount of engineering
(design and supervision.of construction) and strengthened O&M required under
the project, the O&M functions would be separated from construction.
6.03      Under the proposed structure, a Circle would have a drilling Divi-
sioII, 3-4 construction Divisions and one O&M Division. Each Division would
be headed by an Executive Engineer who would supervise 4 Assistant Engineers
and 12-16 Junior Engineers.  The drilling Division would be responsible for
wel:L construction and development. The construction Division would be in
charge of constructing pump houses and delivery tanks, installing pumping
equipment and laying out the pipelines to 3-4 ha outlets. The O&M division
would be responsible for assisting farmers in constructing field channels
from outlets to fields, for designing and supervising the rotational system
of water distribution in the tubewell commands and for maintenance of work-
shop. Within the O&M Division, a Junior Engineer would supervise O&M of up
to 20 tubewells.
6.04      Agricultural services under the project would be closely coordinated
with the activities of the Operation and Maintenance Division. There would be
an Agricultural Officer (AO) with each O&M Division assisted by 10-12 Agri-
cultural Supervisors. The Agricultural Supervisors (ASs) would be paired with
the Junior Engineers in charge of operation and maintenance Sections in order
to assist farmers in better utilization of irrigation provided by tubewells.
The AOs and ASs would be deputed from the Department of Agriculture (DA) in
the State and would be technically supervised by the Director of Agriculture.



- 29 -
Organization Within a Tubewell Command Area
6.05      At present, the cultivators within a command area are organized
into thoks for distribution of water. The deficiency of this organization
is described in para 4.03. Under the project, it is proposed that the con-
cerned Junior Engineer and Agricultural Supervisor in charge of a group of
tubewells would assist in organizing farmers.  Farmers within each outlet
would form a committee and elect a leader to supervise water distribution
within one outlet as per schedule. Leaders of the outlet committees would
elect 5 representative farmers to form a Tubewell Committee for each tubewell.
The Tubewell Committee would have a President and a Secretary and would be
responsible for coordination and cooperation among outlet committees, solving
disputes, and advising the concerned Junior Engineers in working out the
rotational schedule.
Monitoring and Evaluation
6.06      Staff Requirements.  The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (M&E) would
form part of the headquarter staff of the Additional Chief Engineers. The
professional staff of the unit would comprise an Executive Engineer, two
Assistant Engineers, two Agricultural Officers and a Statistician. They
would be assisted by six Junior Engineers, four Agricultural Assistants and
three Assistant Economists.
6.07      Activities.  Monitoring and Evaluation activities are discussed
in detail in Annex 2. In summary, monitoring would consist of collection
and analysis of the following data:
(a) actual investment cost of each construction alternative
in terms of system cost; cost per hectare of command
area and cost per hectare of actually irrigated area;
(b) actual cost per unit of water delivered at the plot
boundaries;
(c) actual supervision, administration, operation and
maintenance costs for each construction alternative;
(d) measurement of water use and losses for existing tube-
well systems and for each construction alternative;
(e) hours of power availability of the 11 kVA substations
and at the well site;
(f) running hours of each pumping unit;
(g) areas irrigated in each season in each tubewell system;
(h) farmers' reaction to the water allocation procedures;
(i) pre-project and post-project yields for each region;



- 30 -
(j) number, amounts and times of irrigations for major crops
in each region; and
(k) well yield and drawdown relationships and water table
fluctuations through time.
The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) unit would coordinate its works closely
with the construction and the operation and maintenance Divisions and with
the DA for the collection of the data.
6.08      A base line study and an evaluation study would be made at the begin-
ning of and towards the end of the project, respectively. These activities
would be sub-contracted to an independent, suitably qualified organization,
satisfactory to IDA.
Progress Review and Reporting Requirements
6.09      Progress reports would be prepared by the M&E unit and be submitted
to IDA within three months of the end of each irrigation season. Each report
would include brief descriptions of the main events of the period including
(a) construction progress; (b) expenditures incurred; (c) project staffing
status; (d) tender, evaluation and award of contracts; (e) irrigation poten-
tial created; (f) actual areas irrigated; (g) operational hours of water
points; (h) power supply situation; and (k) farmers' reaction to water allo-
cation procedures. An agreement has been reached with GOUP that it would
submit to IDA a project completion report no later than six months after the
closing date of the project.
Training
6.10      Staff training would be required in two respects:  (a) training in
design and layout of the proposed pipe distribution systems; and (b) training
in supervision of the operation of the tubewell systems and their associated
command areas. Item (a) is necessary because the pipe systems to be installed
are unfamiliar to the engineering staff who would be responsible for their
layout. The training in this instance would be "in-service," directed by
senior TW officers. A pre-requisite to the training program would be the
compilation of a design manual covering various design situations. The manual
would be prepared by Departmental officers with assistance from FAO/World
Bank CP staff. CP staff would also assist GOUP in technical training during
project execution.
6.11      The trainees in the second category would be officers from the O&M
Divisions. Training responsibilities would be contracted to the State G.P.
Pantnagar University of Agriculture and Technology located in the Nainital
district. Junior staff would be trained at the university for three weeks and
senior staff for one week. The courses would include lectures, discussions,
case studies, and field trips covering O&M of the pump and pipe system, design
of field channels, land preparation for irrigation, water management at the
field level, cultivator organization and basic cultivation practices for
principal crops to be grown in the tubewell commands. In addition, prior to



- 31 -
the acceptance of O&M responsibility of a cluster of tubewells, each Junior
Engineer would be required to live in the command area of at least one public
tubewell for one month to familiarize himself with problems facing the farmers
using tubewell water.  This experience would assist him to manage his cluster
of tubewells more efficiently. Details of the training program are provided
in Annex 3. An agreement has been reached with GOUP that it would engage
O&M staff in training programs acceptable to IDA.
Cost Recovery
6.12      Capital and O&M Costs.  The capital costs of p5oject tubewells,
in financial terms, range3from Rs 3,300 per ha for 330 m /h capacity to
Rs 3,900 per ha for 150 m /h. Recovery of these costs over 20 years at
6% 1/ would require annual repayments ranging from Rs 290 to Rs 340 per ha,
with a weighted average of Rs 320 per ha. The O&M costs, including a flat
charge on the use of electricity (§s 480 per installed horsepower pir year),
range from Rs 140 per ha for 300 m /ha tubewell to Rs 170 for 150 m /h
tubewell, with a weighted average of Rs 160 per ha. Thus, the total average
annual charge necessary to achieve full cost recovery would amount to Rs 480
per ha.
6.13 3    Water Charges.  The existing charge is Rs 1 3er 16,000 gallons
(73 m ) in the kharif and Rs 1 per 6,000 gallons (27 m ) in the rabi. In
general, about one-third of the total water pumped per year is used in the
kharif and two-thirds in the rabi. At prevailing rates, the annual charges
per ha, at different levels of operation, are estimated as follows:
Running Hours          2,000    3,000       3,500     4,000
-----------Rs/ha of CCA-----------
Kharif                  14         20        24         27
Rabi                    71        110       131        148
Total              85        130      155         175
Thus a tubewell needs to run between 3,500 and 4,000 hours per year to cover
O&M costs alone at the prevailing rate. Under the project, it is expected
that the average running hours would reach 3,500 hours. At this operating
level the cost recovery index at current water rates would be 32%.
6.14      Other Related Charges.  Land revenue varies by district and type
of crop grown. On average, the difference between the rates levied on irri-
gated and unirrigated lands is about Rs 25 per ha. If such incremental
revenue is taken into account, the level of cost recovery per tubewell
under the project increases to 38%. If other incremental revenues stemming
from changes in production permitted by irrigation, such as the purchase tax
on sugarcane are taken into account, cost recovery per tubewell would be about
39%. This would imply that about 61% of total costs would be met from the
Government budget.
1/   Borrowing by Government would be at this interest rate in Uttar Pradesh.

6.15      Evaluation of GOUP's Cost Recovery Policy.  From the point of view
of promoting efficient use of water, the present policy of charging for the
use of water from tubewells on a volumetric basis, and of having different
rates for kharif and rabi seasons is sound. In the kharif, water supply from
tubewells is underutilized because of the relatively high rainfall. Conse-
quently, water charges in the kharif need to be sufficiently lc to provide
economic incentives to farmers to use water. Furthermore, experiences else-
where in India show that early planting of paddy would allow early planting of
wheat and thus increase wheat yields. Thus, a high charge in the kharif could
be counterproductive, since many farmers would tend to wait for the rain and,
therefore, delay planting of paddy and wheat.
6.16      Because of the low standard in the distribution systems of existing
public tubewells, the water supply to most tailend farmers is highly unreli-
able and their benefits from irrigation are fairly low. Consequently, water
rates are presently set at a low level in order to give tailend farmers suffi-
cient incentive to use irrigation water, even though the upper-reach farmers
may be able to pay substantially higher charges. Discriminatory charges would
not be feasible due to difficulties in measuring the benefits accruing to each
individual farmer as well as the administrative difficulties in collecting
different rates. The improved technical standards introduced under the
project are designed to ensure that every farmer would receive a reliable
water supply. This would make it possible to collect a higher volumetric
charge from all participating farmers.
6.17      Cost Recovery Proposals.  The effect of various levels of water
charges on cost recovery and project rent is as follows:
Other        Cost
Water     Related      Recovery           Rent
Charges    Charges      Index (%)         Recovery
Alternative           (Rs/ha)    (Rs/ha)    O&M  Capital    Index (%)
I.  Present Water Rates        155          30        100     8          22-27
II. Raise Present Water
Rates to Reflect
Higher Efficiency         210          30       100    25          28-35
III.  Full Cost Recovery         450          30        100   100          56-71
This indicates that, at present water rates, there is some scope for increasing
water charges.  Full cost recovery, however, would stretch project farmers,
capalcities to pay, particularly those of poor farmers. On the basis of preli-
minary results for experimental tubewells and experiences elsewhere in India
on water savings from improved distribution systems, it is estimated that the
benefits per ha under the project tubewell would be about 35% higher than
those under existing tubewells. If the water rates are raised to meet this
objective, water and water related charges would cover all O&M costs and about
25% of the capital costs. This would be within the project farmers' ability
to pay.



- 33 -
6.18      While it is believed that participating farmers will be able to pay
higher water charges, it is proposed that significant increases in water
charges should be made only when: (i) the technical efficiency and adminis-
trative arrangements for the operation of project developed tubewells, in
particular, their ability to provide an assured and timely water supply, has
been clearly demonstrated; and (ii) reliable data on the actual benefits
accruing to project participants has been obtained. Given the poor effi-
ciency of existing public tubewells, it is impractical to expect either
farmers to commit themselves to pay higher rates or GOUP to promulgate higher
water charges until the benefits of the new project technology have been
established clearly.
6.19      Against this background, agreements have been reached with GOUP
that (i) by March 31, 1981 it would review the water charges on the tubewells
in the State; and (ii) based on the recommendations arising from the review and
after paying due regard to the Association's comments, it would implement an
appropriate system of water charges to ensure recovery of annual O&M costs, and
to the extent possible,, the capital costs of public tubewells. In establishing
the level of charges, due consideration would be given to incentives for and
payment of farmers.
VII. AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
Cropping Patterns
7.01      Cropping patterns for the three regions (Western, Central and
Eastern) would generally follow the present practices. Wheat, sugarcane and
fodder crops would be the main crops in the Western region; wheat, paddy and
barley in the Central; and paddy, wheat and gram in the Eastern part. In
the kharif, paddy would be the main crop to receive irrigation whereas in the
rabi, most crops would be irrigated. Availability of irrigation would encour-
age farmers to grow more of the early varieties of paddy (100 to 120 days
duration) in June. This would clear the field for earlier planting of wheat
resulting in higher wheat yields. In addition, high value pulse crops such
as mung would be grown in the hot months with irrigation (March to May) when
they would be less affected by pests than when grown in the kharif. Areas
under cash crops such as oilseeds, sugarcane and potato would also increase
due to irrigation. Details of the cropping patterns for the three regions
are presented in Annex 1, Table T-16.
Crop Yields
7.02      At present, yields of most crops are low due to unreliable rainfall
and the minimal application of modern inputs. Reliable irrigation supply
under the project would increase crop yields significantly. In view of the
stagnant yields of rainfed crops during the last decade, it is assumed that
there would be no change in yields under "future without project" situation as
in the rainfed crops grown under "future with project" conditions. Based on
the data from agricultural statistics and farm management surveys, the pro-
jected yields of major crops are estimated as follows:

Present = Future Without Project        Future With Project
--------------------------tons/ha…--------------…-------
Paddy /a           1.0-1.2                   2.4-3.0

Sugarcane           30.0                      55.0
/a   Early and late crops.
Agricultural Production
7.03      Present agricultural production reflects the uncertain rainfall.
With reliable irrigation, agricultural production would increase significantly
as a result of the adoption of more intensive year-round cropping patterns and
increased yields. Expected total incremental agricultural production at full
development (4 years after commencement of irrigation delivery in each tubewell
command area) is shown in detail in Annex 1, Table T-15 and summarized below:
Incremental Production per Tubewell        Total Incremental
150 m /h      225 m /h    300 m  h             Production
…----------     tons---------------        ----1000 tons----

Oilseeds         3.4           5.1          6.8                  2.1
Sugarcane      128.3         178.2        237.6                80.2
Water Supply and Demand
7.04      The potential irrigation supply from public tubewells depends on
the availability of electricity. Based on the records of the electricity
supply in a normal year and improved outlook in the future, it is assumed
that, under the project, electric power would be avlilable for 16 hours per
day.  On avera§e, the potential supply from a 150 m /h tubewell would be
about 72,000 m per month.
7.05      The crop irrigation requirements, estimated according to the modified
Penman method, are presented in detail for a command area of 100 ha in item B.7
Project File and summarized below:
Region     Jan  Feb  Mar   Apr  May  Jun  Jul 3 Aug   Sep  Oct  Nov  Dec  Total

- 35 -
This shows that sufficient water would be available for the projected cropping
patterns of the three rejions (Annex , Tables T-15 and T-17).  Tubewells with
higher discharges (225 m /h and 300 m /h) would 5 ommand larger areas (150 to
200 ha), but in the same proportion as the 150 m /h tubewell. Consequently,
the above analysis could be applied to the larger capacity tube.wells.
Agricultural Supporting Services
7.06      Agricultural Research.  The State has three Agricultural Universities
which have been assigned responsibility for basic and applied research within
their operational areas. These are: G.P. Pant University of Agriculture and
Technology at Pantnagar, G.S. Azad University of Agriculture and Technology at
Kanpur and N. Deo University of Agriculture and Technology at Faizabad. Pre-
sent research programs cover all branches of agriculture including Agricultural
Economics. Adaptive research remains the responsibility of the DA which at
present has ten regional agricultural testing and demonstration stations.
Plans to establish further two main stations and seven sub-stations are under-
way. The State also maintains an Irrigation Research Institute at Roorke and
a Horticultural Research Station at Saharanpur. Central Government Research
Institutes for sugarcane, grasslands and soil conservation are located at
Lucknow, Jhansi and Dehra Dun, respectively.  Since existing research facil-
ities are adequate for project purposes, no provision would be necessary under
the project.
7.07      Agricultural Extension.  Technically, agricultural extension is the
responsibility of the DA. However, the primary contact with the farmers--the
multipurpose village level worker (VLW)--belongs to the Department of Commu-
nity Development (CD). He works under the administrative control of the Block
Development Officer of the CD. On technical matters, he receives guidance
from the Assistant Development Officer, Agriculture and the District Agricul-
ture Office who are employees of the DA. In general, there are about 10 VLWs
per block covering-about 25,000 to 30,000 ha. This staffing pattern provides
one VLW for every 3,000 farm families. In some blocks covered under special
schemes such as Small Farmers Development, Command Area Development and
Drought Prone Area Development, the ratio is about 1 VLW for every 1,500
families.
7.08      The present extension system is inadequate, as:  (a) extension
services are poorly planned and supervised; (b) VLWs have too many responsi-
bilities and are assigned to cover too large an area; (c) linkages with
research and training are weak; and (d) VLWs suffer from restricted mobility
and inadequate housing. GOUP has recognized the problems and it is attempt-
ing to improve extension services. The concepts of the Training and Visit
(T&V) extension system, such as an intensive staffing pattern, frequent
training, better linkages with research, and the use of contact farmers to
deliver relevant messages are being tried out in the command areas of a number
of surface irrigation systems. The results of this experiment should assist
GOUP to formulate improvements for its statewide extension services.



- 36 -
7.09      The proposed new tubewells would have attractive rates of return
(para 8.07) without T&V. While the application of the T&V system in the
project area would improve returns on investments in public tubewells, the
introduction of the system would be administratively difficult under thnis
projiect. Project tubewells would be dispersed throughout the State, and T&V
would have to be introduced to at least 12 districts of the stU a. This could
not 'be done during the project period of two years. Consequently, under the
project, Agricultural Supervisors would be assigned to a cluster of tubewells
(para 6.04), who would work with both Junior Engineers and existing VLWds to
advise farmers in better utilization of tubewell water.
7.10      Agricultural Inputs.  There is a well developed system for distri-
bution and sale of seeds, fertilizers and pesticides throughout the State.
The requirements of HYV seeds is met by the National Seed Corporation, Terai
Development Corporation (TDC) and by the State Multiplication Farms. Seeds
produced by these agencies, particularly by TDC are distributed, not only to
UP, but also to Bihar, West Bengal and Assam. Fertilizer distribution is
shared equally between private and public sectors. Of the 50% under the
public sector cooperatives, 10% is handled by sugarcane cooperatives, one-
third by the Provincial Cooperative Federation and the rest by the Agro-
Industries Corporation.
7.11      Agricultural Credit.  Institutional credit organization follows the
normal pattern for India. The cooperative banks, which provide short and
medium term loans mainly for agricultural inputs at an annual rate of 12-13%,
are organized on a three tier basis with the State Cooperative Bank at the
State level and 55 central banks at the district level. There are a large
number of primary cooperative credit societies located in some 112,000
villages in the State. Overdues of cooperative banks are presently about
one-quarter of the demand. The State Cooperative Land Development Bank is
handling the long term credit (up to 15 years) at a rate of 9.5% to 10.0%
through 226 branches in the whole State. At present, the recovery performance
is normal at 76%. Commercial banks with 2,800 branches in the State, also
have a major role in agricultural lending (about 15%).
7.12      Marketing, Processing and Storage.  Marketing in UP is regulated
under the Agricultural Produce Market Act (1964). At present, marketable
surplus is traded in about 250 main wholesale markets and 365 sub-yards.
About 40 new market yards are under construction. In general, the provision
of marketing facilities is well responded to the increasing production. Most
processing facilities in UP are privately owned. Some cooperatives (about 57)
have also been involved in processing, particularly oilseeds. Sugar factories
are numerous but about half of them need modernization. In general, there are
no serious constraints to the present system of processing.
7.13      At present, UP has a storage capacity of about 2.8 M tons.  This
capacity is provided by three main agencies: the State Warehousing Corpora-
tion; the Central Warehousing Corporation; and Marketing Federation. In
addition, some cooperatives also have go-downs. In response to the increasing
potato production in recent years, about 50 cold storages with capacity of
85,000 tons have been established. The Bank Group is presently financing a
storage development project (Cr. 747-IN, US$107 M) in UP (among other States
in India) and another one is being financed by the European Economic Community.

VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
General
8.01      The proposed project would expand the area under irrigation in
Uttar Pradesh. Through this mean, it would increase the production of food-
grains, oilseeds and sugarcane and provide additional year-round employment
opportunities to small farmers.
8.02      The design and operational standards proposed under the project
would increase the efficiency in groundwater utilization through both tech-
nical changes suited adaptable to local conditions as well as improvements
in the organization of human resources. If successful, the project would
be eminently replicated to rehabilitate 15,000 existing public tubewells in
Uttar Pradesh but also in other areas of Gangetic plain.
8.03      The overall impact of the proposed project can be summarized as
follows:
Directly benefiting farm families (nos.)                62,000
Increase in irrigated area (ha)                         60,000
Increased foodgrain production (tons/year)              64,000
Increased oilseed production (tons/year)                 2,100
Increased sugarcane production (tons/year)              80,200
Net foreign exchange savings (US$/year)                      10 M
Value added to the local economy (Rs/year)                   80 M
Generated farm employment (jobs)                        30,000
Income Effect
8.04      At present, virtually all benefiting farmers have no access to
irrigation. Two farm models for each region have been examined to assess
the impact of irrigation on farm incomes: a 1 ha farm model representing
about at least three-quarters of the benefiting farmers and a 3 ha model for
the remaining beneficiaries. Estimates of farm incomes are based on farm
surveys, district statistics, and the projected financial prices of inputs
and outputs. Detailed analyses of farm budgets are given in Annex 1, Table
T-18. The results are summarized below:
----------Net Farm Incomes (Rs)----------
1 ha Farm                   3 ha Farm
Region               FWO         FW              FWO           FW
Western              720      3,090            1,690         7,120
Central              530      1,950            1,380        4,810
Eastern              550      1,800            1,480         4,560
FWO: Future Without Project
FW : Future With Project



- 38 -
8.05      In calculating farm incomes, cash payments for needs such as
fertilizer, plant protection, rental charges of animal and tractors and
irrigation costs are included in production costs. With irrigation provided
under the project, net farm incomes would increase three to four-fold.
Returns and Costs of Water
8.06      The economic value of the water depends on the level of agricultural
development and the water supply situation. Based on the estimated cropping
patterns, yields, inputs, utilization for the three regions (Annex 1, Table
T-16), the average economic return per unit of water used ranges from Rs 0.34
to Rs 0.40 per m per year at the water point (Annex 1, Table T-20). On the
other hand, the cost of producing per unit of water at the water point, taking
into account both investment and O&M costs, is estimated about Rs 0.13 to
Rs 0.22 per m for various sizes of tubewells and different running hours
(Annex 1, Table T-20). Thus, the returns would be about twice as much as the
cost of producing per unit of water from public tubewells.
Economic Evaluation
8.07      The assumptions used for the economic evaluation are detailed in
Annex 4. All costs and benefits have been applied by the appropriate conver-
sion factors to make them comparable at world market prices. The incremental
net economic benefits resulting from irrigation would range from Rs 1,700 in
the ]Eastern region to Rs 2,200 in the Western region with an average of
Rs 1,900 per ha of CCA. The economic co t of tubewell investment would range
from Rs 2,13Q for large tubewells (300 m /hr), to Rs 2,540 for smaller tube-
wells (150 m /hr), with a weighted average of about Rs 2,420 per ha of CCA.
The O&M cost would average at Rs 460 per ha. Assuming a four year build-up
period, the economic rate of return of this project is estimated at 36%
(Annex 1, Table T-21).
Sensitivity Analysis
8.08      Sensitivity analysis is used to determine the variables which could
be crucial to the viability of the project. The measure of sensitivity used,
the "'critical value" is the value of the variable tested for which the present
valuie of the project's net incremental benefits discounted at 12% (the esti-
mated opportunity cost of capital in India) is zero. The results are presented
below:

/a   Equivalent to about 16 hours per day during the peak demand of water.
/b   Equivalent to about 6 hours per day during the peak demand of water.
Project Risk
8.09      The results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that only large
(and unlikely at the magnitude required) deviations from the basic project
assumptions could turn this project to be economically unviable. A possible
risk would be the underutilization of public tubewells. In the past, the low
running hours and small areas irrigated from public tubewells were caused by
inadequate power supply, absence of tubewell operators, frequent mechanical
breakdowns and incomplete distribution system. The technical and operational
standards introduced under the project are designed specifically to protect
against underutilization due to the latter three of these factors. As for
power supply, the GOUP and GOI, with Bank Group assistance, are actively
engaged in an investment program designed to increase power availability
in Uttar Pradesh by approximately 80% by 1983, with particular emphasis on
expansion of the supply network in rural areas. At present, power avail-
ability during peak agricultural season averages about 12 hours per day.
Since the critical value is about 6 hours per day, the project is still
economically viable even if tubewells are operated at the present rate of
power availability. Consequently, the risk associated with this project is
acceptable.
Environmental Effect
8.10      The water delivery through buried pipes proposed under the project
would greatly reduce the hazards of malaria which is normally encountered in
areas with surface canals. However, the introduction of irrigation to the
rainfed areas is often accompanied by an increase in the incidence of water
related diseases. An agreement has been reached with GOUP that it would
take all measures considered necessary to minimize the hazards of malaria
and other water related diseases in the command areas of project tubewells.
IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      An agreement has been reached with GOI that it would make the
proceeds of credit available to GOUP on GOI's standard terms and arrange-
ments for development assistance to the state (para 5.29).



- 40 -
9.02      Agreements have been reached with GOUP that:
(a) it would select command areas as well as, design, construct,
operate and maintain project tubewells in accordance with
the criteria agreed with IDA (para 5.27);
(b) it will cause the State Electricity Board to energize the
tubewell pump units within two months after completion of
piped distribution systems (para 5.27);
(c) it would promptly provide funds to execute the project in
accordance with the agreed implementation schedule for the
two-year period (para 5.29);
(d) (i) it would maintain separate accounts on project expen-
ditures; (ii) these accounts would be audited by the
State auditor; (iii) audit summaries would be submitted
to IDA nine months after the close of its fiscal year
together with the auditor's reports; and (iv) it would
make available complete accounts and financial statements
to IDA during supervision missions (para 5.34);
(e) it would submit to IDA a project completion report no later
than six months after the closing date of the project
(para 6.09);
(f) it would engage O&M staff in training programs acceptable
to IDA (para 6.11);
(g) it would undertake a review of water charges on the tube-
wells in the state by March 31, 1981 (para 6.19);
(h) based on the recommendations of the review and after paying
due regards to IDA comments it would implement an approporiate
system of water charges to ensure recovery of annual O&M costs
and to the extent possible, the capital costs of public tubewells.
In establishing the level of charges, due consideration would be
given to incentives for and payment capacities of farmers
(para 6.19); and
(i) it would take all measures considered necessary to minimize
the hazards of malaria and other water related diseases in
the command areas of project tubewells (para 8.10).
9.03      With the above agreements, the proposed project would be suitable
for an IDA credit of US$18 M on standard IDA terms. The Borrower would be the
Government of India.

1/  Tle average value of the three regions.
2/  Some studies of farmers' behavior, show that a simple approach can be adopted to
tiake into account the farmers' risk aversion by estimating a certainty equivalent
value (CE) of the expected value (EV). The formula used is:
CE = EV - n x s
where s = the standard deviation
n = a factor that expresses the farmers' risk aversion
The studies indicate that the farmers' choice of cropping pattern and production
techniques can be predicted for values of "n" in the interval 1 to 2 and that "n"
decreases when farm size increases. For this analysis, it is assumed that n = 1.5
for 1.0 ha farm and n = 1 for 3.0 ha farm. The variation of the gross returns are
assumed to be within 20% of the average values under "future without project"
conditions and 10% under the project.
3/  Valued at average market wage rate.
4/  The reward for special skills that farm management requires and is assumed to vary
within 10% of the net returns.

UTTAR PRADESH PUBLIC TUBEWELLS PROJECT
Monitoring and Evaluation
General
1.        The purpose of monitoring and evaluation under the project would be
to provide feedback information from the fields and to assess the perf'ormance
of alternative well sizes and conveyance systems. The Government of Uttar
Pradesh (GOUP) and IDA would jointly review the results of monitoring and
evaluation studies at the end of the second year of the project implenienta-
tion. Based on the outcomes of the review, design and operational criteria
would be established for future projects.
Monitoring and Evaluation Activities
2.        Construction Costs of Various Alternatives.  The Superintendent
Engineers of Circles under the project would be responsible for monitoring
construction costs. Actual costs should be compared to estimates made prior
to construction. If actual costs differ significantly from estimates, state
the reasons for the deviation. The proposed format for reporting construc-
tion costs is presented in Proforma 1. The proforma should be prepared
quarterly for tubewells completed during the period and made available for
IDA's supervision missions.
3.        Operation and Maintenance Cost of Various Alternatives.  The Execu-
tive Engineer who would head an O&M division would be responsible for moni-
toring the O&M cost. The proposed format for reporting O&M costs is presented
in Proforma 2. The proforma should be prepared at the end of each irrigation
season (kharif/rabi) and made available for IDA's supervision missions.
4.        Flow Measurements.  In order to assess the efficiency of irrigation
delivery of various types of tubewells, flow measurements of each tubewell
should be carried out twice a year by the Junior Engineer in-charge. In addi-
tion to measure flows of project tubewells, 10 existing tubewells per district
should also be selected as a control group for the measurement exercise. The
result would assist planners in quantifying the efficiency of old and new
tubewells. The following measurements should be carried out: (a) discharges
at the delivery tank; (b) discharges in selected outlets along the distribution
system; and (c) discharges at the end of the field ditches. (a) could be
measured by the V-notch, (b) and (c) by portable parshal flumes. A format for
presenting results is proposed in Proforma 3. The proforma should be prepared
semi--annually and made available for IDA's supervision mission.

ANNEX 2
Page 2
5.        Power Supply' and Demand.  The junior engineer should also be respon-
sible for monitoring and availability and reliability of power supply. He
should compare the hours of power available recorded by the t .ewell operator
at the well site to the records of the sub-station serving that particular
tubewell. He should also compare the power rostering schedule with the
records of sub-stations and tubewell operators. Proposed format is presented
in Proforma 4. The proforma should be prepared monthly to submit to the
Executive Engineer (EE) in charge. If there is any discrepancy between the
posted schedule of power rostering and the records at sub-stations as well as
at tubewell sites, the EE should inform the State Electricity Board.
6.        Monitoring and Watertable.  Observation pipes should be installed
in selected tubewell systes'l to monitor the depth of water from ground level
and to provide early warning of over-pumping or waterlogging hazards. Static
and pumping water levels will also be measured in all wells at 6 month
intervals. The JE would be responsible for the measurements. Records
should be kept and made available for IDA's supervision missions.
7.        Junior Engineer's Monthly Journal.  At the initial stage of the
project, each junior engineer would be responsible for about 20 wells. He
should visit each well twice a month, supervise daily activities of tubewell
operators, check on the water allocation/distribution and to assist tubewell
operators/farmers. At the end of each month, he would make a monthly report
of the operational progress using records maintained by the tubewell operator.
The report should include rainfall in the command area (rainfall measured at
a station close to the tubewell command could be used), running hours, areas
irrigated, areas of major crops irrigated, hours of closure and reasons for
the closure, and the average number of waterings. Format for a journal is
presented in Proforma 5. The proforma should be prepared monthly by the
junior engineer and submitted to the Executive Engineer in charge.
8.        Performance Review.  The monthly journals from the Junior Engineer
would be sent to the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit. The staff of this unit
would analyze the data of each tubewell under operation and summarize monthly
results at the end of each irrigation season. The performance report should
be presented to the Chief Engineer and attached to the progress report (para
10 below) to be sent to IDA. Suggested format for this report is described
in Proforma 6.
9.        Impact Studies.  The staff of the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit
to be established in the Tubewell Organization would carry out impact studies
at the end of each season. The studies would be on stratified sample basis
and cover:
(a) areas under irrigated crops and rainfall crops in the
command areas of selected tubewells;
(b) crop cutting experiments for major crops to determine
yields of both irrigated and rainfall crops;



74
ANNEX 2
Page 3
(c) time of sowing, planting and harvesting of major crops; and
(d) time of irrigation and number of irrigations for major crops.
The data should be compiled and analyzed at the end of each irrigation season
and results submitted to IDA along with the progress report.
10.       Progress Report.  Progress reports would be prepared by the staff
of Monitoring and Evaluation Unit and submitted to IDA at the end of each
irrigation season. Each report would contain brief descriptions of the main
events during the period including: (a) construction progress; (b) expendi-
tures incurred; (c) status of project staffing; (d) tendering, evaluation
and award of contracts; (e) irrigation potential created during the period;
(f) actual areas irrigated during the period; (g) average running hours per
tubewell operated during the period; and (h) farmers' reaction to water allo-
cation procedures.
11.       Baseline Study and Evaluation Study.  An agro-economic survey of
the area where tubewells would be constructed would be carried out prior to
construction. The study should be on a stratified sample basis and cover
beneficiaries' holdings, cropping patterns, yields, input requirements, use
of hired labor, farm capital owned, credit utilization, existing irrigation
facilities and their utilization. Three years after the baseline study,
an evaluation study would be carried out in the same area with the same
coverage to determine changes in the agricultural scene due to availability
of tubewells. The study would also survey existing tubewells as a control
group for comparison purposes between existing and improved designs. Both
studies should be contracted to Universities in UP or other economic develop-
ment institutes in India. The baseline study should be completed one year
after credit effectiveness and the evaluation study one year after project
completion.
12.       Completion Report.  Towards the end of the second year of the
project implementation, based on the baseline study, monitoring results and
impact studies, staff from the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit would prepare a
completion report to be used in the discussion between GOUP and IDA. The
report should at least include:
(a) actual investment costs and O&M costs of each alternative;
(b) actual investment costs and O&M costs per ha of command
area of each construction alternative;
(c) actual investment costs and O&M costs per ha of actual
irrigated area of each construction alternative;
(d) actual cost per unit of water at plot boundaries;
(e) average seasonal running hours (kharif and rabi) or
power supply from feeders serving tubewells constructed
under the project for each district;

(f) average seasonal running hours (kharif and rabi) or
tubewells constructed under the project for each
district;
(g) average seasonal areas (kharif and rabi) of each alter-
native for each district;
(h)  average yields of major crops for each district;
(i) irrigation efficiencies of each construction alternative;
(j) farmers' reaction to various water allocation procedures;
(k) comparison of tubewells constructed under the project with
existing tubewells with respect to running hours and areas
irrigated cropwise; and
(1) extent of closure of tubewells constructed under the proj-
ect in each district:
-    due to power rostering
-    due to non-demand
-    due to mechanical defects.

Assumptions for Financial and Economic Analysis
Official Exchange Rate (OER)
1.        Until September 24, 1975, the Rupee was officially valued at a
fixed Pound Sterling rate. Since then it has been fixed against a "basket"
of currencies. As these currencies are floating, the US dollar/Rupee ex-
change is subject to change. Conversions of financial prices have been made
at US$1 to Rs 8.40, which represents the projected exchange rate over the
disbursement period of the credit.
Standard Conversion Factor (SCF)
2.        The benefits of the project components are evaluated at world
market prices which measure what India would have to pay for imports or
receive for exports. Most of the costs, however, are for items that are not
traded on the world market. Tariffs and trade restrictions introduce a dis-
tortion in the price relationship between traded goods (valued at world market
prices) and non-traded goods (valued at local prices). Thus, the costs are
not directly comparable with the benefits. In order to make them comparable,
an SCF is applied to the price of non-traded goods and consumption. In the
absence of trade restrictions, the SCF can be approximately calculated using
the formula:
SCF =                  X +M          1/
X + S + M + T
x        m
For the period since 1970, this calculation gives an SCF of 0.86. However,
since this estimate does not take into consideration quantitative restrictions,
it provides only an upper limit for the SCF. The Indian Planning Commission
recommends for the evaluation of industrial projects the use of conversion
factors for foreign exchange and for untraded goods that implicitly give a
SCF of about 0.75. Because of the approximate nature of this estimate, a
SCF of 0.8 has been used in the economic analysis.
1/   X = fob value of exports at the official exchange rate (OER); M = cif
value of imports at OER; Sx = export subsidies; Tm = import duties.

Prices of Agricultural Outputs
3.        The economic prices of major traded agricultural outputs such as
rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, oilseeds and sugarcane are derived from the IBRD
projected 1985 world market prices expressed in 1979 currency value writh
appropriate ajustments for freight, handling and processing. The domestic
cost component) i.e., local transport and marketing charges) are adjusted by
the SCF of 0.80. The economic prices for non-traded foodgrains such as mil-
lets and pulses are derived by applying the historical price ratios between
these outputs and wheat to the economic price of wheat. Fodder has been
valued at its market price (adjusted by SCF) less the economic cost of bring-
ing them to the market. Detailed derivation of the economic prices for major
traded goods is described in Table 1. The financial prices of agricultural
outputs are projected on the basis of their historical price trends. A sum-
mary of all projected economic and financial prices is presented in Table 1.
Prices of Agricultural Inputs
4.        Fertilizers have been valued at the projected world market price.
Tractor power, pesticides and insecticides have been assumed to be traded,
and prices are adjusted for taxes and duties. The financial prices of camels
have been multiplied by the SCF to express them in economic terms.  Analysis
of farm labor supply and demand in various Indian irrigation projects typic-
ally give an economic shadow wage rate for farm labor in the range of one-half
to two-thirds of the average financial wage rate. In view of the existence
of a larger number of agricultural laborers in UP compared to other States in
India, a shadow wage rate of 60% of the market wage has been assumed for the
analysis of this project.
Construction Conversion Factor (CCF)
5.        The construction of project components would be carried out by
equipment., skilled and unskilled labor. For the economic analysis, the con-
struction conversion is estimated as follows:
% of the
Conversion Factor        Construction Cost
Traded component                 1.00                       10
Skilled labor                    0.80                      35
Unskilled labor                  0.60                      45
Total                                                100
Weighted Average           0.75
Application of Estimated Conversion Factors
6.        In the calculation of the project economic rate of return, all
construction costs are multiplied to the CCF, establishment cost for O&M to
the SCF since they mostly consist of non-traded goods, and the traded com-
ponents to the OER to express them in terms of border prices.
