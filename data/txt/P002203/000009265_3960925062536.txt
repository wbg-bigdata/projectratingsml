MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRES1DENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on R-wanda
Lake Kivu Coffee Imrnmovement and Foodcro2 Project {Credit 11 26-RW)
Attached Is the Project Completion Report on Rwanda - Lake Kivu Coffee
Improvement and Foodcrop Project (Credit 1 1 26-RW) prepared by the Africa Regional
Office. The Borrower did not contribute a Part II for the report.
The project did much to improve the organization and effectiveness of the
extension service, but still fell short of truly successful institution building. No system
was put in place to ensure adaptation of extension messages to respond to farmers'
needs. Although the foodcrop component did poorly, and a processing component added
during implementation soon became under-utilized, the project's coffee production benefits
expanded rapidly and, by one estimate, far beyond expectations. An early draft of ths
PCR, submitted to OED in June 1992, estimated an ERR of 20 percent, but this was
before the country situation deteriorated sharply as a result of the disastrous effects of the
civil war. The PCR was subsequently revised in March 1993, at our request, to reflect the
Impact of the country situation on the project. The revised PCR does not reevaluate the
ERR, reputedly because of the considerable uncertainties that exist on the long-term
effects of the civil war on coffee production in the project area. While sustaining project
benefits is thus uncertain, the apparently solid early gains of this project and the chance
that supplies of vital inputs might be restored within the next year or so, leads to a rating
of project performance as satisfactory.
The Project Completion Report provides a good account ot project imple-
mentation and of performance until late in 1992. No comments were received from the
Borower, presumably because it had already submitted its own PCR.
An audit is intended because of uncertainties attached to current assessments
of performance and because of the importance of export crops like coffee to the Rwandan
economy.

aCREDfl 1126i-W
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report for the Lake Kivu Coffee Improvement and
Foodcrop Project for which Credit 1126-RW, in the amount of US$15.0 million, was approved on
March 31, 1981. The Credit was closed on December 31, 1988, two years behind schedule. The last
disbursement was on November 22, 1988; the credit was filly disbursed.
The report was prepared by the Agricultural Operations Division of the South-Central
and Indian Ocean Departnent (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). This report is based,
inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit Agreement, supervision reports,
correspondence, and a project completion report prepared by the executing agency.
The report was sent to the Borrower with a request to prepare Part II. No comments
were received.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
ect Backgromnd
1.    Rwanda Is one of fte smallest, but most densely populated countries in Africa. In 1980, at the
time of project design, the population was estimated at 4.8 million, growing at an annual rate of 2.9%.
Population density varied widely, between 328 inhabitants per km2 in the Butare prefecture to 87
inhabitants per lkm2 in the savannah areas. Land pressures had already resulted in excessive clearance
of forests and over-utilization of the soil. Other natural resources being limited, agriculture was the
most important sector of the economy. Increasing agricultural productivity was a key priority of the
Second Five Year Plan (1977-1981). Agricultural research had demonstrated that yields could be
increased by using improved inputs and different production technologies. Progress in introducing these
new technologies had been limited, primarily because the extension service was not trained and equipped
for the task.
Proiect Objectives and Descrintion
2.    The main objectives of the project were to build up an effective extension service, which would
assist farmers in increasing foodcrop and coffee production using field-tested techniques and help OCIR-
Cafe, the implementing Agency, improve its financial management. In order to achieve these objectives,
the project included: (a) strengthening of OCIR-Cafe's financial managament; (b) improvement of
extension services under the direction of OCIR-CafE; (c) promotion of improved methods of plantation
maintenance, coffee nursery organization and pest control, distribution of improved seed varieties,
intercropping of banana plantations to increase food production and a program to improve soil .ertility;
(d) improvement of 120 existing hand pulping machines and establishment of 130 new ones; (e)
constuction of two landing points on Lake Kivu, of bridges and culverts and minor improvements to
three existing landing points; (t) strengthening of crop related research, studies and trials; and (g)
services of four internationally recruited specialists and of short-term consultants. At appraisal, total
project costs were estimated at US$16.6 million, of which the Government of Rwanda was to contribute
US$1.0 million, Swiss Aid US$0.6 million (for two extension specialists) and IDA US$15.0 million.
Poecti DImpementation-
3.    Implementation started in 1981 under PPF financing. Most of the project activities progressed
slowly, because of cumbersome procurement procedures and delays in obtaining counterpart funds and
replenishment of the Special Account. As a result, the credit was closed on December 31, 1988, a de)ay
of three years. Several changes were made in project design during implementation: (i) the project area
was realigned in 1982, primarily to avoid duplication between the project and a donor financed
agricultural services project in Kibuye; (ii) the project area was divided into four zones (Cyangugu,
Kibogora, Kibuye and Gisenyi) in 1984; activities in these four zones were decentralized and the zones
were given financial and administrative autonomy, which permitted a betwer follow-up of field activities;
the latter change prompted Swiss Aid to withdraw its support from the project; (iii) subsequent to a 1983
coffee sub-sector review by IDA, Government and IDA agreed to rehabilitate the Nkora washing station



iv
in order to inprove the quality of Rwande  coffee; (iv) the liaison office in Kigali was transferred to
Kibuye in 1984; and (v) the Joint implementation of the research component by OCIR-Cafe and the
Agricultural Research Instute of Rwanda (ISAR) was discontinued in 1987, when all research
responsibiLities were transferred to ISAR.
Projou Results
4.    The project exceeded objectives for coffee production. Esimates of the project's impact on food
crop production vary widely. According to project staff, production increases IV ',e been close to
appas estimates, while some Bank staff feel increases have been only marginal. Unfortunately, the
baseline survey plannd for 1981 w&s never carried out. All data in the report come from a 1986
survey. A 1987 supervision mission estimated that coffee production was expected to increase over time
by as much as 55% as a result of the project. The extension service was successful in convincing
farmers t adopt a lage number of recommendaions related to plant care, soil improvement and erosion
control. In fact, erosion control measues implemented far exceeded appraisal targets. The planting of
trees also was adtd by many farmers, once the extension service was able to provide adequate
supplies of the popular varieties. The research actvities were a failure. The studies that were carried
out under the project led to the rehabilitation of the Nkora coffee factory and as input into the
Agricultural Sewvices Project (Cr. 2026-RW).
S.    Production results for coffee are not exe    to be sustainable in the long-run because of the
effects of a prolonged civil war on the availability of inputs (especially pesticides) and the financial drain
posed by a system of adminstered coffee prices, that are presenty set above world market levels.
Foodcrop production increases, especially for cassava and sweet potatoes are expeaed to be sustainable.
in terms of instituton building, the project results are mixed. A system of cost recovery existed prior
to the project and the extension service in the project area was reorganized in order to match existing
adminisave strues. No system was put in place, however, to ensure that the extion service
would be able to adapt existing messages to respond to farmers' needs. This matter is now being
addresse under the Agricultal Services Project (Cr. 2026-RW).
6.    The project had a positive impact on farm household income. Based on the 1986 survey, income
in constant terms matched appraisa estmates for families living in coffee growing areas; however,
income of farm families living in high altitude areas has not changed. The latter group was, however,
small. The increase in farm household income was in part the result of above world market firmgate
prices for coffee. As these prices are not sustainable in light of the country's economy, they will need
to be adjusted downward in real terms, thus reducing project gains.
7.    At appraisal, the economic rate of retum  was estmated at 21.6%. Ihis was based on the
incrementl production of coffee and food crops. The project completion report prepared by the
Borrower imatd the rate of return at 46% based on inmental coffee production only with relatively
high coffee prices. Since considerable uncerainties exist about the macro-economic policies and the
impact of the armed incursion on coffee production, and no reliable data are available on food crops
production, the economic rate of retrn cannot be estimated.
LgwsD Leaed
8.    Ihe following lessons can be drawn from the implementation of this project:
(a)   In extemion projects it is of vial importance that proven production packages can be
developed early on in the projecl. In this project, no adequate food crop production
package could be developed, despite the impression that such technology was already
available at project preparation.



v
(b)    The division of responsibilities between the research and extension services needs to be
clearly defined prior to project start-up. The capacity of the research organization to
carry out its responsibilities should also be evaluated during project preparation.
(c)    Market outlets for production should be found prior to making decisions on research and
extension of production techniques. In the case of this project, farmers did not respond
as expected to the increased availability of sweet potato and cassava cuttings because the
markets for surplus production did not exist.
(d)    Extension has to be demand driven in order to succeed. In this project, the initial
reaction of the executing agency was to satisfy appraisal targets, rather than meet
farmers' demands (coffee tree planting, seeds and tree production, and erosion control
measures), which delayed getting the farmer to adopt the extension message and
required more intensive supervision by Bank staff.

2.    P:ioj Backgroud
2.1    Rwanda is one of the smallest, but most densely populated countries in Africa. In 1980, at the
time of project design, the population was estimated at 4.8 million, growing at an annual rate of 2.9%.
Population density varied widely, between 328 inhabitants per km2 in the Butare prefecture to 87
inhabitants per km2 in the savannah areas. Land pr&sures had already resulted in excessive clearance
of forests and over-utilization of the soil. Other natural resources being limited, agriculture was the
most important sector of the economy. In 1978, it contributed about 50% of GNP (three quarters of
which from subsistence crops), accounted for more than 70% of its export earnings (80% of which from
coffee), and supported over 95% of the population. Agricultural productivity was, however, low and
about 30% of export revenues was spent on food imports.
2.2   Increasing agricultural productivity was a key priority of the Second Five Year Plan (1977-
1981). Agricultural research had demonstrated that yields could be increased by using improved inputs
and different production techr Y gies. Progress in introducing these new technologies had been ilmited,
primarily because the extensio. Oervice was not trained and equipped for the task.
3.    Proiect Objectives and Description
3.1    The project aimed to increase fooderop and coffee production. Project staff would promote
improved agricultural practices that had been field tested but not introduced into rural areas on a wide
scale because of inadequate extension and logistic support. A major effort would be made to develop
an effetive system of extension so as to better utilize existing human resources and ensure that project
production goals were met. If successfil, the extension system introduced under the project would serve
as the basis for future extension programs in Rwanda. The project was to be implemented over five
years. An estimated 60,000 of the 75,000 farm families in coffee growing areas were expected to
benefit from the coffee growing component and about 15,000 from the foodcrop component; a fiurher
2,500 of the 10,000 families living in highland areas were expected to benefit from the foodcrop
component. Project activities were consistent wit? -overnment's objectives of increasing food



2
production and foreign exchange earnings through increased coffee exports. The Project included the
following components:
(a)    Strengthening of the financial management of the Agency for Industrial Crops
of Rwanda - Coffee (OCIR-Caf6);
(b)   Improvement of extension services un& . the direction of OCIR-Cafe;
(c)    Promotion of improved methods of plant-tion maintenance and coffee nursery
organization as well as pest control campaigns to increase coffee production;
distribution of improved seed varieties and irltercropping of banana plantations
to increase food crop production; and a program to improve soil fertility
through stall-feeding in conjunction with compost production, introduction of
fruit trees, planting of forest trees and soil eroaion cwntrol measures;
(d)   Improvement of 120 existing hand-pulpinj centers and establishment of 130 new
ones;
(e)    Construction of new landing points along Lake Kivu, minor improvements to
three existing landinig points and construction of bridges and culverts;
(f)    Strengthening of crop-related research, studies and trials; and
(g)    The services of three internationally recruited specialists, one to train OCIR's
financial and administrative staff, two for extension staff training and
development, and of short-term consultants to assist with the extension
component activities and with the applied research activities for coffee and food
crops of the Agricultural Research Institute of Rwanda (ISAR).
4.    Proiect Design and Organization
4.1    The extension, civil works and research components were poorly designed. They had been
inadequately prepared at appraisal, which resulted in implementation delays. Also, in hindsight, the
sustainability of the institutional arrangements had not been adequately addressed at the design stage.
In particular, the issues of cost recovery and implementation responsibility after credit closing were not
setfled.
4.2    The Bank had correctly resisted pressure to expand the project area to include other regions in
Rwanda, because of the limited implementation capacity of OCIR-Cafe and the focus of the project.
4.3    The main risks identified at the time of appraisal were: (i) implementation delays resulting from
management difficulties (OCIR's limited capacity and lack of qualified staff); and (ii) the extension
program would be less effective than planned. Project design explicitly addressed these problems.
4.4    OCIR-Caf6 was selected to implement the project, except for the research component, which was
to be implemeated in collaboration between ISAR and OCIR-Cafe project personnel. The project
headquarters were to be in Kibuye, with a liaison office at OCIR-Caf6's headquarters in Kigali. A
project department was to be established within OCIR-Cafe to coord;natte project activities. Ihe project
was to be administered with the help of annual work plans, including a detailed budget.

5.    Project Imlementation
5.1    Effec.ixeness. The credit was declared effective on December 4, 1981, a delay of five months
for bureaucratic reasons (preparation of the legal opinion and publishing the ratification of the Credit
Agreement in the official Gazett#).
5.2   Project Costs and Financing. At appraisal, total project costs were estimated at US$16.6
million, of which the Government of Rwanda was to contribute US$1.0 million, Swiss Aid US$0.6
million (for two extension specialists) and IDA US$15.0 million. By the end of the project, actual total
project costs were estimated by the project unit at US$15.6, of which the Government of Rwanda
financed US$2.3 mfillion and IDA financed US$13.25 million, I/ C(able 3, Part I). The value of the
technical assistance financed by the Swiss Goverment could not be obtained. Actual versus estimated
costs show that significant shifts had taken place between project components. Significant cost increases
were incurred by: (i) the coffee and food crop improvemenit component (5% more - higher than
anticipated distribution of plants and seeds); and (ii) the construction of lake landing points (178% more
- a substandal design change). In addition, the rehabilitation of the coffee factory at Nkora had not been
foreseen. Substantial cost savings were obtained in three other areas: (i) extension (45% less - much
less use of technical assistance than estimated and less vehicles were procured than planted); (ii) pulping
stations (69% less - lower than expected costs of equipment); and Ciii) research (66% less - this activity
suffered because of a lack of manpower on the part of ISAR).
5.3    Disursements. The credit was closed on December 31, 1988, after a delay of two years. It
was fully disbursed and the last disbursement was made vu November 22, 1988. The delay was the
result of slower than expected progress In the civil works program, a delayed start-up of extension
activities, and a desire on the part of Government to retain project financing for recurrent costs until the
Agricultural Services Project (Cr. 2026-RW) could provide financing for extension and research
activities in the project area.
5.4    rocuremnnt. In general, procurement was slowed down as a result of bureaucratic procedures.
Substantial delays were encountered in the tendering of civil works contracts, because of a lack of
qualified contractors in the project area, and in the execution of these contracts, because of poor roads
in the project area and contractors hzd underestimated the extent of work that needed to be done.
Delays were also encountered in the delivery of hand pulping machines and spare parts, which resulted
in considerable delays in installing the new machines and repairing existing ones.
5.5   Prject Managmnt. Maintaining experienced local staff in key positions was difficult because
of the general shortage of such staff.
5.6    Changes in Project Desin. During project implementation, it became apparent that maintaining
a liaison office in Kigali was not practical from a managerial perspective (the financial and administrative
staff was split over the two locations) and that the liaison offize would need to be transferred to Kibuye.
This process was completed in 1984, when the financial advisor started working in Kibuye.
5.7   Several changes were made in the project area in 1982 in order to avoid duplication between the
project and a donor financed agricultural services project in Kibuye. A new eotension zone was created
in Cyangugu, that grouped the communities of Oishoma, Cyimbogo, Kamembe, Gisuma and Gafwizo.
The communities of Gitesi and Mabanza were incorporated into the donor fianced project in Kibuye
and three sectors in the Gisovu community were left out of the project, because they did not fit in well
(location and suitability for crops). In the same year, the communities of Rubuva and Gishyita and the
1/    Difference due to US$ - SDR exchange rate fluctuations.



4
highland sectors of the Rutsiro community were integrated into the project. As a result, the number of
farm families in the project area increased to about 100,000.
5.8   In 1984, the project area was divided into four zones (Cyangugu, Kibogora, Yibuye and
Gisenyi). Activities in these four zones were decentralized and the zones were given financial and
administrative autoDnmy, which permitted a better follow-up of field activities (para 6.3).
5.9   Subsequent to a 1983 coffee sub-sector review by IDA, Government and IIDA agreed to
rehabilitate the Nkora washing station in order to improve the quality of Rwandese coffee. During
project preparation, this idea had been dropped in order not to overburden OCIR-Cafe's limited
managerial capacity, but IDA had accepted to review the situation during project implementation (para
6.16).
5.10  The joint implementation of the research component by OCIR-Caf6 and ISAR was discontinued
in 1987, when all research responsibilities were transferred to ISAR. The institutional arrangement had
proven to be cumbersome. A new disbursement category was established in 1987, to allow ISAR to
submit withdrawal requests directly.
6.    Implementation of Individual Project Components
A. Strengthening of OCIR-Caffs financial managemem
6.1   For several years prior to the project, OCIR-Cafe had difficulty maintaining its accounts. The
project, therefore provided financing for the services of an expatriate financial advisor to assist OCIR-
CaWs financial management and train local staff. The first financial advisor left the project in 1983.
His replacement was hired in late 1983. It was agreed that about 70% of the latter's time would be
spent supporting project headquarters and 30% supporting staff at OCIR-Cae's headquarters. He
designed a new accounting system and was charged with its implementation in 1986. The advisor left
in December 1987 and was successfully replaced by local staff. Audits of project accounts and OCIR-
CafM have been satisfactorily carried out throughout project implementation and recommendations by
the auditors have been consistendy implemented.
B. Improvement of Extension Services
6.2   Start-up of extension activities was delayed by one year in the Cyangugu zone and by two years
in the Kibogora zone because of late completion of the training centers and lodging facilities. The
original schedule was followed in the Kibuye and Gisenyi zones. Swiss Aid provided for three technical
assistants that aided in the training of extension staff (two had been planned).
6.3   The extension activities were carried out under the direction of OCIR-Caf6. The original format
provided for highly centralized supervision and a very intensive training program. In 1983, the traiing
format for extension staff was revised because too much time was spent on training, leaving insufficient
time for field activities. Elements of the Training and Visit method of extension were incorporated into
the extension system. Because the centralized decision making structure slowed down project
implementation and prevented the zone agronomists from being fully utilized, it was decided in 1984
to decentralize responsibilities. The project area was divided into four zones (Cyangugu, Kibogora,
Kibuye and Gisenyi), one more than planned, and each zone was given administrative autonomy. The
broad implications of this change were that Rwandese agronomists would have effective responsibility
for project administration and execution and that expatriate staff would have responsibility over technical
matters (technical messages and themes; seed multiplication and research plots and nurseries; and



5
technical training of extension staft). The decision to transfer more project responsibilities to local staff
and less to technical assistants led Swiss Aid to withdraw its support to the project in 1984.
6.4    Organization of extension services improved markedly during project implementation. The
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, which was established in 1982, was instrumental in evaluating
individual extension worker's performance and in identifying weak areas and problems in the extension
system. Most of these problems could be remedied through tighter supervision and closer relations with
local authorities. The effectiveness of the extension service was undermined by the low level of training
of part of the field staff, despite intensive training efforts by the project, and serious lack of training
materials, new technical messages of interest to farmers, and inputs. However, by 1986 about 71% of
the coffee farmers had received training from extension staff and 85% of these farmers had adopted
project recommendations.
C. Improved Coffee Cultivation
6.5   Planting Material. The aim of the project was not to extend the area under coffee but to
improve productivity of existing plantations. At the time of appraisal, about 15% of coffee trees were
planted in unsuitable locations. These trees would be uprooted and new plantations would be established
in more suitable locations. In addition, about 10% of the area used for coffee production was planted
with dead trees or with less than optimal density, and these areas would need replanting. It was
estimated that approximately 3.3 million coffee plants would be needed during project implementation
to achieve these goals. During implementation, it became apparent that farmers were reluctant to uproot
coffee trees in marginal areas for lack of a better alternative, but instead were extending the area under
coffee. The project did not address this problem. A total of 4.5 million plants were distributed to
farmers, which yielded an increase in the number of coffee trees in the project area of 3.7 million, 2.2
million more than anticipated at appraisal. Planting densities (2,000 per ha) and varieties (Jackson 2 and
Bourbon-Mayaguez) were based on research carried out by ISAR.
6.6   Plant Care. The project provided pruning tools (secateurs and saws) free of charge to groups
of farmers. Proper pruning was adhered to by most farmers in coffee areas. Farmers in areas with low
coffee production, however, were reluctant to remove excews buds from coffee trees.
6.7    Almost 60% percent of the farmers practiced mulching, which is quite impressive given the
general shortage of mulching materials in the project area. Farmers did not use chemical fertilizers for
three reasons: (i) unavailability of chemical fertilizers in many parts of the project area; (ii) high cost;
and (iii) results of chemical fertilizer use at the farm level were disappointing because inadequate
information was available to the farmers on its proper use.
6.8   Pest Control. A Bank supervision report, dated Nover.ber 4, 1985, stated that substantial work
needed to be done on pest control and that a consultant's report, a report by ISAR and an internal Bank
memo all came to the conclusion that pest control was severely lacking, despite the distribution of
significant amounts of pesticide. As a result, the extension service carried out a systematic campaign
to control pests and farmers were trained in the proper procedure of applying pesticides. Towards the
end of the project, on average, about 89% of all coffee plants in the project area were treated each year,
which compares with an appraisal target of 90%.
D. Food Crop Production
6.9    The project had anticipated increasing food crops production through the extension of improved
production techniques and the introduction of improved seeds. A baseline survey, planned for 1981,
was unfortunately never carried out. The recommendation to intercrop beans and bananas was accepted
by a large number of farmers. Unfortunately, ISAR was unable to develop new techniques that were



6
attractive to farmers. Seven seed multiplication centers were established, four more than planned.
Cassava and sweet potato cuttings were also distributed. Seeds were provided by ISAR and the Selected
Seed Service. The new seed varieties did not compete well against locally available ones. Insufficiently
developed market outlets for the production of sweet potatoes and cassava slowed their introduction.
At the start of the project, about 1.2% of farmers received improved seeds, this number peaked in 1985
at 11.2%, after which it declined to 2.2% at credit closing. Even though cost recovery had been
envisaged, only partial cost recovery was achieved.
E. Soil Protection and ImprMovment
6.10  Erosio .   proI. Erosion control was to be achieved through the establishment of contour
hedges and the digging of blind ditches and the planting of ground cover In coffee plantations. Early
on in the project it became apparent that using grasses for erosion control was not feasible since these
grasses would compete with adjacent food crops. TMe project therefore adopted the recommendation
that contour hedges should be established with plants providing food, fodder and or firewood that do
not compete with adjacent crops. The blind ditches would be substituted by inclined walls that could
be planted with permanent crops. The extension service was effective in convincing farmers of the
benefits of these hedges and by project completion, about 82% of the farmers had adopted extension
recommendations. Research on groundcover in coffee plantations was inconclusive and no technical
message was developed.
6.11   Stall Feeding and Comnostin . Almost half the farmers in the project area (48,000) had some
livestock. Part-time stall-feeding for manure collection was encouraged and almost 24,000 farmers
participated. However, fodder, which was expected to come from the anti-erosion grasses dnd from
fodder-crop fields established by the project, was insufficient. In addition, serious problems arose in
transporting the manure to the fields. The project provided cattle and dipping tanks to interested
communities. About 87% of the families established compost pits. An apparent lack of materials
suitable for composting made it difficult to assess the success of this activity.
F. Forest and Fruit Tree Prduction
6.12 The project area was severely deficient in firewood. As a result, material suitable for mulching
was used for making fires instead. In order to address this problem, the project distributed forest and
fruit trees. Initially the production of especially fruit trees was not aimed at farmers needs, but merely
at maximizing production. This was evidenced by the lack of care of farmers for the young trees. A
project report stated that of the 53 trees that were given to each farm family during project
implementation, a large amount died fairly quickly afterwards. After Bank intervention during a
supervision mission, the production of avocado trees was increased to match demand and the production
of less popular fruit trees was decreased. The most popular forest species were the Mrevillea and
callitris, which fitted well into the agroforestry systems. Eu£Iyg    and pines were distributed mainly
for use on individual forest plots on steep hills. All trees were distributed free of charge.
G. Coffee Processing
6.13   The extension service was successful in sensitizing farmers to the need of picking mature
cherries only and bringing them to centers with handpulping machines, rather than trying to depulp them
manually. This gready increased the quality of the coffee.
6.14 Hand Pulging Machines. Ihe project provided financing for the procurement of 130
handpulping machines and the repair of 102 existing ones, 18 less than planned. The slight reduction
was the result of changes in the project area; it was foreseen at appraisal that every coffee extension
sector would have 2 machines on average. Stocks of spare parts for the maintenance of all machines



7
were created, albeit with delays due to cumbersome procurement procedures and slow replenishment of
the special account. Four mobile maintenance brigades were formed to assure proper maintenance of
the equipment (two were envisaged at appraisal). As a result of the increase in the number of
operational hand pulping machines, the average distance between farm and hand pulping station
decreased and more coffee was handled this way. For farmers, the increased access to pulping stations
meant a sizable decrease in the quantity of labor needed to process cherries, coupled with much higher
quality semi-washed coffee.
6.15   Rehabilitation of Nkora Washing Staton. One of the major conclusions of an October 1983
mission reviewing the coffee sub-sector was that the overall quality of Rwandese coffee had declined
dramatically. One of the principal recommendations of the mission was for Government to reconsider
the possibility of processing its coffee through ceal washing stations. The rehabilitaion of the Nkora
coffee factory had been reviewed at appraisal, at which time it had been decided to postpone the
rehabilitation, in order not to overburden project management. As a result of the study, the Bank agreed
to reverse the earlier decision, pending the outcome of the studies. Technical and financial feasibility
studies were undertaken and it was decided, in part drawing on the experience gained in Burundi, to
commence the rehabUitation. USA1ID provided some financing for a hydro-elecical generator and IDA
financed the acta  rehabilitation of the factory from savings elsewhere in the project. After delays
resulting from the selected contractor's alleged inability to perform (this matter is still pending in the
Rwandese courts), a new contractor was selected and the factory was able to commence coffee
processing in 1988. The factory is presendy under-utilized because of a lack of incentives for farmers
to bring the cherries for processing to the factory and poor management. The factory will be privatized
as part of the coffee sector reform, which is to be implemented under the Agricultural Sector Adjustment
Credit (under preparation).
H. Civil Works
6.16 A dense network of roads and tracks already existed in the project area. Maintenance was
carried out through the existing systems of Umaganda community participation (half a day of community
work per week). The repairs and construction of bridges and culverts was carried out without significant
delays. Active community participation helped in the rehabilitation of existing bridges, with the project
providing the materials. Along the shore of Lake Kivu, four new landing points were constructed
instead of the two foreseen at appraisal. The landing points at Kibuye and Cyangugu project 36 meters
into the lake; at Kirambo and Nkora the landing points project 24 meters into the lake. Because of
prevailing conditions, more expensive materials had to be used (concrete and steel, rather than timber
crib works). The planned improvements to the landing dock at Gisenyi and the construction of the new
landing dock at Mugunero were not carried out, because of cost overruns on the landing points that had
been completed.
I. Strengthening of Cro-Related Research and Trials. and Studies
6.17 Crop-Related Research and Trials were carried out by ISAR at the Rubona research station and
through field trials in the project area. The scope and quality of research was severely hampered by a
lack of qualified project personnel and the centralized organization of ISAR. Research for coffee trees
focussed on planting densities, adaptability of different varieties to the project area, ground cover and
the use of mineral fertilizer. Except for the research on ground cover, all research was done in a
controlled environment. Research on ground cover was also done at farms in the project area. Research
on crop densities and varieties was flawed; research on ground cover is still ongoing, as is research on
mineral fefiflizer. Research on diseases and pests was not carried out. Fooderops research did not yield
results that could be translaied into a production package for local farmers and research on the impact
of mineral fertilizer on foodcrops production was never carried out.



8
6.18   Studie. Three studies were undertaken: (i) a study on the coffee sector in preparation of the
agricultural services project; (ii) a production survey in the project area in 1986; and (iii) a feasibility
study of the coffee washing station at Nkora. The 1981 baseline producdon survey was not carried out,
because of resistance within OCIR-Caf to use the repayable IDA credit for this purpose.
J. Techlica Assisac
6.19 The Swiss Government provided financing for the services of three expatriate extension
specialists (only two were foreseen at appraisal). Their main contribution was In the area of training
of extension staff. This support was withdrawn in 1984, because of the reorganization of the extension
service (para 5.10).
6.20   The first expatriate financial advisor left in 1983, after two years, for personal reasons. The
expatriate financial advisoi left after four years, after having headed the financial bureau of the project.
He implemented several financial and administrative reforms and successfully trained a local staff
member to take over.
6.21   The short-term consultants to assist with the extension component activities and with the applied
research activities for coffee and food crops of the Agncultural Research Institute of Rwanda (ISAR)
were not hired, which led to serious delays in the research component.
7.    Proect ReWts
7.1    The extension service was successfully reorganized along the lines of the training and visit
system and able to convince the majority of farmers to adopt project recommendations related to plant
care, and soil improvement and erosion control. In terms of institution building, the project was less
successful. Even though a system of cost recovery existed prior to the project and the extension service
in the project area had been reorganized in order to match existing administrative structures, no system
was put in place to ensure that the extension service would be able to adapt existing messages to respond
to farmers" needs. This matter is now being addressed under the Agricultural Services Project (Cr.
2026-RW).
7.2    The project has met or exceeded objectives for coffee production. A 1987 supervision mission
estimated that coffee production was expected to increase by as much as 55 percent as a result of the
project. Estimates of the project's impact on food crop production vary widely. According to project
staff, and Bank staff involved in early project supervision, production increases have been close to
appraisal estimates, while other Bank staff-associated later with the project-feel that increases have been
only marginal. Unfortunately, the baseline survey planned for 1981, was never carried out. The
production data in Table 5, Part m, are based on estimates from project staff and the results of the 1986
production survey.
7.3 The multiplication and distribution of seeds was a failure for existing crops in the project area.
The distribution of cassava clippings and a new potato variety was successful, even though adoption was
limited by insufficient market opporunities.
7.4    The planting of trees was adopted by many farmers, once the extension services was able to
provide adequate supplies of the popular varieties. The extension service distributed 53 trees per family
(para 6.12) as against 9 planned. It is doubtful, however, that the number of trees which survived
exceeded appraisal estimates considering the high mortality of the trees that were distributed early on
in the project (these were often not of the varieties most in demand by farmers).



9
7.5   The coffee processing component has met apprais-l estimates for the handpulping machines.
The Nkora factory has been under-utilized because of a lack of incentives for farmers to bring coffee
cherres to the factory and because of poor management. The factory is slated to be leased to the private
sector, as part of the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (in preparation), which is expected to have
a beneficial impact on plant utilization.
7.6   The civil works component improved area transportation noticeably and met most appraisal
targets.
7.7    The research component was a failure. Most of the research agenda was not carried out and the
research that was carried out was of poor quality and yielded no results. The studies were useful in
preparing for the Nkora coffee factory rehabilitation and the Agricultural Services Project (Cr. 2026-
RW).
Economic Performance
7.8   The project had a positive impact on farm household income. Based on the 1986 survey, income
in constant terms matched appraisal estimates for families living in coffee growing areas; however,
income of farm families living in high altitude areas had not changed. The latter group was, however,
small. The increase in farm household income was in part the result of above world market farmgate
prices for coffee. As these prices are not sustainable in light of the country's economy, they will need
to be adjusted downward in real terms, thus reducing project gains.
7.9    At appraisal, the economic rate of return was estimated at 21.6%. This was based on the
mcremental production of coffee and food crops. The project completion report prepared by the
Borrower estimated the rate of return at 46% based on incremental coffee production only with relatively
high coffee prices. Since considerable uncertainties exist about the macro-economic policies and the
impact of the armed incursion on coffee production, and no reliable data are available on food crops
production, the economic rate of return cannot be estimated.
EMiect Sustainabilit
7.10   Production results for coffee are not expected to be sustainable in the long-nn because of the
effects of a prolonged civil war on the availability of inputs (especially pesticides) and the financial drain
posed by a system of administered coffee prices, that are presendy set above world market levels.
Foodcrop production increases, especially for cassava and sweet potatoes are expected to be sustainable.
In terms of institution building, the project results are mixed. A system of cost recovery existed prior
to the project and the extension service in the project area was reorganized in order to match existing
administrative structures. No system was put in place, however, to ensure that the extension service
would be able to adapt existing messages to respond to farmers' needs. This matter is now being
addressed under the Agricultral Services Project (Cr. 2026-RW).
8.    Bank Perfonnan
8.1   The Bank provided active supervision of the project, with frequent short field visits by the
Agricultural Country Officer of the resident mission in Kigali and, prior to 1986, active supervision by
staff from the Nairobi regional mission.
8.2    Bank supervision missions were able to address project shortcomings at an early stage. Cases
in point were the need to rehabilitate the Nkora coffee factory, the problems with the food crop
program, the resurgence of coffee pests and the mismatch between production and demand for fruit



10
trees. In the case of the food crop program, the research component was restructured, albeit too late
to have had an impact on the project. Bank supervision missions, however, were unable to address the
delays in obtaining funding for the project and in speeding up the procurement process.
9.    Borrower Performance
9.1    OCIR-Caf6 as executing agency performed well during project implementation. Due to its
specific orientation, however, it was better placed to increase coffee production than foodcrops
production. The Government participated positively during project execution. Due to internal
regulations, however, it was unable to speed up procurement and project cashflow (either Government
provided funds or reimbursement claims), which delayed project execution. Government also transferred
key project staff to positions outside of the project halfway during project implementation, which further
delayed implementation.
10.   Consultants    man
10.1 ,Performance of the expatiate technical assistants was good. The second financial advisor was
able to implement several improvements over the life of the project. The three extension advisors were
only present for a short time, but were able to devote a significant part of this to training. Short-term
consultancies for the studies were also of good quality.
- *. Project Documentatio
11.1 Project documentation in general has been adequate. There is, however, a severe discrepancy
between the supervision reports and the food crop data as collected by the project, the latter being far
more optimistic.
